Two weeks ago, the Cambridge City Council passed the Cycling Safety Ordinance, new legislation that plans to make the city safer for cyclists. The law will create a 20-mile network of bicycle lanes and set in motion a five-year sidewalk and street construction plan. Bicycle safety activists have hailed this groundbreaking project as an important step forward.
From 2010 to 2014, Cambridge was the site of an average of 184 accidents per year involving cyclists with no indication of a potential decline. Most of these cyclists did not sustain serious injuries, but many suffered “incapacitating” injuries and some crashes in the past have proved fatal. These accidents demonstrate a clear need for improved bicycle safety regulations, especially as bicycle ridership continues to increase overall.
The City Council’s to establish a plan to increase bike safety is commendable. The city has acted decisively and novelly to address the problem of cycling accidents, setting an example for cities across the country. We are proud of Cambridge for taking these innovative steps in the interest of its citizens.
As it stands, cyclists may not feel particularly safe in Cambridge. And Harvard students are no exception. Indeed, the most dangerous stretch of road for cyclists in the Boston area is Massachusetts Avenue between Columbia and Trowbridge Street — which runs directly in the direction of Harvard Square.
Hopefully the Cycling Safety Ordinance will lead to fewer accidents and make residents and Harvard students more comfortable cycling around the city. We are optimistic that if these regulations are successful, it will encourage other cities to follow Cambridge’s lead.
Though this legislation is impressive, the City Council should remain vigilant against inequitable implementation. The new plan needs to reflect the geographic landscape of Cambridge’s socioeconomic diversity. New bike lanes and new protections for bikers should benefit all members of the city, especially since wealthier residents have more available alternatives for transportation.
It’s worth noting that the Cycling Safety Ordinance was a collaboration between the City Council and local advocacy group Cambridge Bicycle Safety. We commend the hard work of the organization to make demonstrative change in the community and blaze a trail for productive collaboration between the city and non-profit groups. And we laud the city residents — some of whom include Harvard students — who sacrificed their time to make this collaboration possible.
As increased bicycle use continues to offset the toll cars and other motor vehicles take on our environment, as well as make for a more active community, we are glad we can look to the Cambridge City Council and Cambridge residents for leadership on making our urban environments more accessible and safe for cyclists.

Watch any outstanding performance, and you’re bound to want to see it again. Especially in a meticulous dance performance with imperceptible gestures and surprising sounds, movement can become easily overwhelming and fleeting for the viewer, making the idea of a rewatch all the more enticing.
In Batsheva’s Celebrity Boston debut of “Venezuela” at the Boch Center Shubert Theater on April 5, audience members had the lucky opportunity to watch the same performance twice. Choreographed by Batsheva’s former artistic director Ohad Naharin, the 40-minute show runs two times back-to-back. With this stunning performance, Batsheva proves that structuring dance in repeated sections can evoke vivid imagery and foster previously unexplored conversations between different cultures and nationalities.
Similar to Naharin’s other choreographed performances, “Venezuela” breaks down into distinct sections within the 40-minute show. At the performance’s start, a clump of eight dancers face upstage and sway slowly. Eventually, they burst into rhythmic gestures and sensuous tangos. After a brief blackout, the four dancers straddle the backs of their partners who crawl up and down the stage, evoking the image of camel riders trekking gingerly through the desert. This slower section gives way to dancers rapping along to B.I.G.’s hit “Dead Wrong” and skipping frantically on and off the stage with the energy of children at the playground. At the end, dancers whip out flags in a mesmerizing unison section and finally showcase their individual solos.
As expected in a repeated performance, the second half of “Venezuela” closely parrots the sections from the first half. Even with an entirely new cast and changes in individual solos, the phrase work and movement quality stay eerily the same. Viewers can relish the opportunity to rewatch segments, such as the melodic skipping and the powerful flag beating, and scrutinize the performance for small details they may have missed the first time.
But keeping the two 40-minute segments entirely the same would be boring, which Naharin is well aware of. While the cast barely changes the actual movement, most of the production details dramatically shift. The trance-like Gregorian chants constant in the first half change to songs that arguably work better with the expressive movements. Heavy metal song “Bullet in the Head” by Rage Against the Machine accompanies the angry flag section while Indian folk song “Ae Ajnabi” by A.R. Rahman and Sampooran Singh Gulzar plays alongside the camel riders. Along with the refashioned music cues, lighting changes and new props make the viewer see supposedly similar sections with fresh eyes.
The skipping section, in which a flurry of dancers slowly pick up speed, emerges as a standout. In an impressive display of athletic endurance, dancers skip across the stage in random patterns without faltering, all the while remaining calm and playful. Batsheva’s dancers, known for their explosive gestures and uninhibited movement, shine as artists and athletes in the solo section. As a crescendoing harsh noise plays in the background, dancers move with unrelenting confidence, flexibility, and grace. The energizing solo section offers one of the rare moments in “Venezuela” where the company dancers can individually show off their breathtaking feats of control and emotion.
Repeating the dance also offers the audience a chance to revisit how Naharin peppers the performance with provoking details. During the second half of “Venezuela,” dancers intensify the types of props, by using flags with Palestine’s colors, and loudly rap controversial lyrics from B.I.G.’s hit “Dead Wrong” instead of just whispering it as they do in the first half. Depending on the audience’s knowledge of world politics and familiarity with English, these production choices impact viewers differently. While certain audience members might perceive the rap’s crude lyrics as offensive, others who have become used to similar lyrics might remain unaffected. And furthermore, if non-English speakers listened to the rap, such as when the company performed in Israel, audience members could tune out the lyrics all together.
Ultimately, such subjectivity means that the performance exists not just in two versions, but instead can be experienced in as many distinct ways as there are viewers. By confronting the audience with bold production choices that change depending on perspective, Naharin forces viewers to react instantaneously to the props, music, lighting, and movement, and to grapple with the fact that they perceive the performance through the lens of their own values.

“Everything Handmaids wear is red: the color of blood, which defines us,” says Offred, the protagonist of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Renee Nault’s graphic novel adaptation, which features this quotation on the back cover, embraces this explicit visual vocabulary. Offred’s scarlet robes radiate against the muted hues of her surroundings. They trumpet her singular purpose: to give birth. Nault presents the puritanical Republic of Gilead with a brutal austerity that instantly distills the text’s most pertinent themes.
Indeed, amid today’s aggressively anti-intersectional political climate, “The Handmaid’s Tale” is certainly having a cultural moment. Atwood’s decision to pen a sequel, “The Testaments,” arriving this September, affirms her novel’s relevance 34 years after its publication. Sadly, “The Handmaid’s Tale” as a current phenomenon today owes largely to its stylistically thriller-esque TV adaptation. Casual reference to the book evokes imminent apocalypse, an anti-feminist End of Days. Saturated coverage has diluted the concise frankness of the original work.
Nault’s adaptation, however, exercises uncommon restraint. Liberal use of blank space conveys the maddening lack of stimulation and the impossibility of escape. Even the most hectic illustrations ultimately accentuate the accompanying text. Through watercolor and ink, Nault imbues her figures with surprising gentle humanity. Fear, not malice, maintains the status quo. Oppressors exist not as comic book villains, but more alarmingly, as good people failing to act.
Off all the characters’ appearances, Offred’s is the most generic. She possesses few identifying traits besides brown eyes and hair. In a crowd or even in a pair, distinguishing between Handmaids often becomes impossible. Whereas the TV adaptation gives Offred a face (Elisabeth Moss) and a moniker (“June Osborne”), the graphic adaptation makes her at once anonymous and universal. She more closely parallels Atwood’s Offred, who never reveals her real name. Nault’s heroine is arguably even more instantly relatable.
Nault shrewdly avoids overt displays of emotion, reserving drama for when it matters. Her character’s expressions are usually subtle. The historical significance of the novel’s New England setting naturally implies some of Gilead’s underlying ascetic fanaticism. Nault’s diligent recreations of colonial brick houses and their self-righteously modest interiors simply heighten that fervor. Humorous little drawings interrupt terse confrontations with shameless glee. The delightful absurdity of a special forces soldier wearing a pink hand-knitted scarf, for example, elicits a private giggle.
Most aesthetically compelling is the juxtaposition between the unfeeling present, rendered through discordant bold colors, and the intimate familiarity of the recent past. Nault bathes Offred’s cherished memories in warm, harmonious hues. Her recollections of friends and family, sketched lightly in pencil, have already begun to fade. Conversely, painful experiences suddenly emerge as thick brushstrokes forcefully dash the page. Still, on the whole, life seems peaceful and calm. The Handmaids, in their softly tapered hats and full, billowing gowns, begrudgingly embody the feminine ideal. Forget sensational carnage — romantic serenity is more chilling.
Nevertheless, any visual adaptation of “The Handmaid’s Tale” presents an admittedly pedantic conundrum. The Republic controls women by banning mechanisms of free thought, most notably through written word. “Now it’s forbidden, for us. Now it’s dangerous. Now it’s indecent,” says Offred. On Gilead’s main streets, images of cows, eggs, and bees prevent the “temptation” of reading the shops’ names. Nault’s illustrations, though veritably engaging, still beg the question of what may be lost. Indeed, in an interview with The Crimson, Nault describes Atwood’s involvement in Nault’s work as “pretty hands-off altogether.” Unfortunately, any graphic adaptation bearing Atwood’s complete text would be lengthy and redundant.
Nault’s adaptation does uphold the general storyline, which is structured into a series of episodes just as in the original. She crucially preserves the sanctity of the numerous unresolved ambiguities. The two editions do noticeably vary when Nault occasionally sanitizes Offred’s contemptible thoughts, trading character depth for likeability.
Offred’s first-person narration in Atwood’s novel is resolutely feisty and sharp. Her unfiltered earnesty helps her cope. During the ritual of mechanical, loveless intercourse known as the Ceremony, Offred evaluates her partner with a cynical wisecrack: “If he were better looking would I enjoy this more? At least he’s an improvement on the previous one.” Later, Offred disparagingly describes a fellow Handmaid as “formerly that whiny bitch Janine.” At the sight of a cruel former supervisor from the prison-like Red Center, she fills with rage: “I would like to strangle her,” Offred says. Nault purges these remarks to put forth a more relatable narrator whose plight quickly draws sympathy. A “nasty woman” like Atwood’s Offred, however, would likely still appeal to the predominantly liberal audience drawn to this feminist work.
For fans of the original book, “The Handmaid’s Tale: The Graphic Novel” introduces a striking new visual experience to the iconic realm of Gilead. One can also hope Nault’s provocative and captivating adaptation can galvanize first-time readers to seek further answers in Atwood’s text.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s just a short while away from the last day of classes and the beginning of reading period. You see the light of the end of the tunnel — until you check your to-do list, and any ray of light you thought you saw suddenly flickers before completely extinguishing. P-sets? Can’t even remember what calculus is. Research papers? Haven’t found sources yet. History exam? Still need to catch up on reading.
What do you mean, “That assignment was due last week”?
What you really need to do is hunker down in a corner of a library with just your laptop and a gallon of espresso for company, but devious spring chooses this particular week to actually arrive, making the weather too nice to not go outside and make bad decisions. At least you have this playlist to soothe you through your end-of-semester panic.
Listen to the playlist here.
“I’m A Mess” by Bebe Rexha
A song titled “I’m A Mess” could have easily been arranged as a confessional ballad, but instead, Rexha’s punchy, almost aggressive delivery of the lines “I’m a mess, I’m a loser / I’m a hater, I’m a user” paired with timed claps and a catchy guitar riff makes this pop tune a victorious celebration of a dysfunctional state of mind. In the pre-chorus, Rexha proclaims, “Everything’s gonna be okay / It’s gonna be a good, good life / That’s what my therapists say,” which perfectly captures the mild hysteria you experience when you calculate the amount of time needed to catch up on your work and realize that it’s impossible to finish even if you don’t sleep. All the Lamonsters out there who sport dark circles and haven’t showered for a few days, just own up to it like Rexha does: You’re a mess.
“Drunk” by Ed Sheeran
As classes come to a close, you’ll often find yourself oscillating between phases of vigorous determination and loss of motivation. One moment, you feel like grinding through a problem set, and the next, you feel like Ed Sheeran — “I wanna be drunk when I wake up / On the right side of the wrong bed.” Reading period is the prime time to forget you actually have finals coming by going to formals constantly and delude yourself into thinking that break has started. It seems like there’s no better time to catch up on all that partying that you haven’t been doing during the past few months — until you wake up in the morning and realize you’ve dug yourself into a deep hole. Moral of the story? When Ed Sheeran’s deceptively sweet voice starts crooning “Should I, should I? / Maybe I’ll get drunk again” into your ear, try to ignore it.
“Everything Is Fine” by All Time Low
The title of this track may be “Everything Is Fine,” but the actual lyrics speak about being decidedly not fine: a perfect parallel to how you tell everyone you’ve got everything under control while you internally break down over the hundred-and-ten things you need to do but haven’t started. The bright melody of the chorus is accompanied by prominent drum beats, giving the track a 2008 Jonas Brothers feel, but the lyrics strike a sharp contrast, sounding more like Green Day at their peak edginess. “I slept through another day / And it makes it all okay if I don’t care” sounds like an unhealthy coping mechanism, but let’s not pretend that we don’t all do it once in a while.
“Who Needs Sleep” by Barenaked Ladies
Know what’s better than BDE? BCE. No, not Before the Common Era, history nerds — Big Chaotic Energy. “Who Needs Sleep” positively pulses with BCE; the track’s chorus is uplifted by a delightful cacophony made up of twanging guitars, faint toots on a flute, disinterested-sounding claps, and the clack of tambourines. The lyrics of the chorus are sung-spoken in short little bursts, punctuated by beats that strike on every syllable, emphasizing the frustration in the lines “Lids down, I count sheep / I count heartbeats / The only thing that counts is / That I won’t sleep.” With sarcastic cheerfulness, the Barenaked Ladies remind despairing, complaining college students that no matter no sleep-deprived you think you are, you should “be happy with what you’re getting” since “there’s a guy who’s been awake / since the Second World War.”
“R.I.P. 2 My Youth” by The Neighbourhood
“R.I.P. 2 My Youth” is a highly poetic, Tumblr-esque track for those students who feel miserable about the approach of finals, but miserable in an aesthetic way, you know? Right now, you might be thinking that it’s too dramatic to tell your friends, “close my eyes and then cross my arms / put me in the dirt, let me dream with the stars,” but once you’ve spent the night at a library cramming for an exam and halos are swimming around every object because you’ve been staring obsessively at a computer screen like it’s a sleeping Bella Swan and you’re Edward Cullen, you’ll be singing a different tune. In fact, you’ll be singing “R.I.P. 2 My Youth.”

“We’re all going to die. But at least we’ll die together,” Tormund Giantsbane says on the eve of the great battle against the White Walkers. And yet, not a single character dies in this episode. For a show that so mercilessly kills off important characters, it is shocking that two straight episodes in arguably the most important season of both have a nonexistent body count. Instead of the epic battle against the Night King — which the preview for this episode heavily implied would begin — this episode let all the characters gathered at Winterfell have their heartwarming moments. However, unless a high percentage of characters are killed in the coming battle, this actionless hour parading our favorite characters across the stage will feel like a waste.
To be fair, this episode — "A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms" — had its share of emotional moments. For one, it was a banner hour for Jaime Lannister as he arrives in Winterfell to fight the dead, despite Cersei’s threats. The episode begins as Jaime stands trial in front of Sansa, Jon, and Daenerys. When Tyrion’s appeal for his brother fails, it is Brienne who steps up and vouches for Jaime in honor of the indescribable camaraderie the two share. Later, Jaime apologizes to Bran for pushing him out of a window all those years ago. Bran accepts his apology but tells him, “You weren’t sorry then,” reminding viewers just how much character development Jaime has undergone since his horrible actions in the very first episode.
And one can’t talk about this episode without addressing the countless instances of female power that resonate throughout it. For one, the episode begins with two women and just one man seated at the table, making decisions. Lady Mormont, just a child, insists on fighting with the rest of the soldiers when the dead come. A little girl tells Sir Davos that she wants to fight, and Sir Davos tells her she must be brave and stay back to defend the women and children. Arya impresses Gendry with her fighting abilities, and then sleeps with him. Brienne is knighted by Jaime, becoming Sir Brienne of Tarth, Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. But most importantly, Sansa and Daenerys discuss what it is like to rule over men (particularly men who have trouble taking orders from women). However, before the two women can get too sentimental, Sansa asks the million dollar question: Who will rule the North when Daenerys takes the Iron Throne? The women in Westeros are not afraid to fight tooth and nail, but Sansa makes it clear that they are each fighting their own battle for their own reasons and that she will not kneel to Daenerys simply because she is a fellow woman.
Luckily, the strange levity that permeated through the previous episode is nowhere to be found in this one. Instead, the tone is quite somber as the characters spend what very well may be their last night alive. Because of the impending battle, all of the important characters get screen time as they tie up any loose ends: Podrick passes the evening with his two mentors Tyrion and Brienne, while Sir Jorah apologizes to Daenerys once again and vouches for Tyrion’s cleverness. Despite all of these heartfelt moments, there was absolutely no action in this episode. On one hand, it is nice to have one last hurrah with all our favorite characters before they go off to die. On the other, this lack of action feels like a cruel joke after the preview so heavily implied the battle was going to be taking place in this episode.
The only justification for such an inactive hour would be if many of the characters who were given screen time to set things right are then killed in the upcoming battle. If favorites die, the last moments depicted in this episode will resonate more deeply and make their deaths more meaningful. However, if the pattern of a 100 percent survival rate continues into the next episode, this entire hour was a waste. After two episodes of inactivity, “Game of Thrones” owes us a battle. And after the hour we just watched, it better be bloody.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was raised, like most children, grazing on the wet-scaled, lily-draped underbelly of classroom politics. I was sent to a K-12 school with 600 children. We all knew each other — recognized each others’ mothers' fashion on our little claymade knees and necks — and would know each other for at least 13 years after the first day of school. In our first years, we sat in assigned groups around brightly painted wooden tables and learned when you write a letter, the recipient's address goes smack in the middle of the envelope and yours goes in a small corner on the left. (I still expect letters in the mail, lovingly stamped, but no one writes me.) We learned fractions and were introduced to the nematodes and mollusks — on which my father quizzed me with an iron voice in the mornings before school — and memorized each other's birthdays; and that was when the polity was introduced to politics.
Oh, the birthdays — such bloodthirsty, gift-hungry, worrisome affairs. Until we were 13, everyone was welcome. No conscientious mother would rob her child's classmate of an invitation for fear of retribution. Our parties were a youthful bacchanalia, no sobriety in the room — save the rueful tired-gray smoke that draped the chaperones' faces. There were streamers and magicians and bouncy houses and return gifts — little bags with chocolates and maybe, if the birthday boy or girl was rich, a Spiderman action figure or a monster truck or — god forbid — a pencil case. Some parents dared to take us to swimming pools, where we all urinated freely, as if bathrooms could never quite be enough. We forced each other under until one of us cried or swam away, lurking in the deep end until the anger had passed. We raced and cannonballed, and the children on the margins — the children that could not swim as well or did not play with us at recess — still made it in, crossed the city walls before nightfall.
And then, suddenly, at 13, the parents left us to our own devices, and the invitations grew scarce, shriveled like raisins. I was invited to some things — not all, never all — at first. I smuggled abandoned friends, hidden in pockets and backpacks, across gates with me; they smuggled me. “We carpooled. I couldn’t get here without his car,” and other feeble pleas. At these parties, groups would form naturally; a clique here, a clique there. Each made their own pathetic celebrations of gossip and rumors — the stuff of teenage heartbreak; we were dusty corners in banquet halls and floating ants in swimming pools, and sometimes, disco balls hung precariously from a peeling ceiling.
For a playwriting class this semester, I was asked to consider invitations. Who, or what, do I want to invite to the theatre? Who is invited to occupy space on the stage? Who is welcome and whom will I turn away? In answering these questions, I keep returning to my K-12 school and the politics around invitations — to that clawing, youthful discomfort which has since matured into something more ominous. That discomfort now rears its ugly head at the alienness of being here, away from my homeland. Here, in the melting pot, the uninvited — the uninitiated, the immigrants — stick to the sides of this cauldron like cheap copper. Some of us are luckier than others — we live easier lives studying at top-tier universities and find security through other means; but what of those hundreds of thousands who are welcomed to minimum wage jobs with open arms, but little else? What of the people at home, who have been painted in one, assuming Western shade, in hues of third-worldness and nothing more?
Who do I invite to occupy space in the theater?
Today, I invite to exclude as much as to welcome. We have all been othered, marginalized somehow, but that is not to say that all that othering is the same, or equal. Definitively, I can say: It is not. My youthful politics is a mild form of the childhood violence that twisted my ears and pinched my arms, but is incomparable to the violence, physical and emotional, inflicted upon others like me. I write for, and about, India, people of color, and the immigrant community, many of whom are not so lucky to have access to a theatrical platform. I want them to feel like I have painstakingly built a nest, twig by twig by twig, for their little winged bodies. For the rest, I want them to know that pain and discomfort exist in shades bloodier than they may have known. That is my invitation to you: Swallow the pain of being unwelcome so that you may never say, "I did not know," so that you may lend a hand of support to the uninvited and welcome them to a history that has left them on the margins.

​​​​​​
Harvard University, Harvard Law Review, and United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos continued to argue in a set of filings Thursday that an anti-affirmative action group, which has alleged the Law Review has discriminatory member selection policies, has not sufficiently proved it has standing to bring the case.
The group — Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences — initially brought the complaint to Massachusetts District Court in October 2018. They have since amended their complaint to include the Coalition for Meritocracy at Universities as co-plaintiffs. The groups claim they have members who are Harvard Law School students impacted by the member selection policies.
The lawsuit also includes allegations that members of FASORP and CMU are applicants for faculty positions at the Law School and face illegal discrimination resulting from affirmative action in Harvard’s hiring processes. The groups most recently filed in late March, reiterating their standing in the case, along with their claims that Harvard and the Law Review are subject to federal laws and have violated them. They argue that DeVos has violated the law by not withdrawing federal funding from Harvard as a result of its alleged discrimination
Throughout the case, Harvard and the Law Review have independently argued the plaintiffs have not demonstrated they have standing to bring the case. In their January amended complaint, FASORP and CMU claimed that they had current Harvard affiliates who would be affected by the University’s and Law Review’s policies, but did not provide names.
In Thursday’s reply briefs, Harvard, the Law Review, and DeVos reiterated that the plaintiffs’ failure to explicitly identify members affected by the affirmative action policies after the defendants’ repeated requests prevents them from qualifying for standing.
“Plaintiffs’ continued failure to identify any injured member by name—even after two bites at the apple—is fatal to their Amended Complaint,” the Law Review’s brief reads. Harvard and the Law Review filed separate briefs.
DeVos’s response claims that even if Harvard or the Law Review were to be found guilty of discrimination, they would be unable to use that outcome to disqualify affirmative action policies across the country. Her lawyers argued in their brief that if Harvard and the Law review were indeed guilty, they would be obligated to redress only the specific alleged injuries.
“Thus, while Plaintiffs would prefer this lawsuit to impact ‘the use of race and sex preferences at every University in [the] United States,’ a ruling against the Harvard defendants would adequately remedy the only injury that Plaintiffs allege: that their members will encounter discrimination when they are subjected to the Harvard defendants’ policies,” the brief reads.
Harvard and the Law Review also reiterated their argument that the University cannot be held responsible for the Law Review’s policies because it is not directly controlled by Harvard.
“Allegations suggest the Law Review and Harvard interact or cooperate in certain ways, but that does not show the Law Review is ‘operated by’ Harvard, as is necessary for it to be a ‘program or activity’ of Harvard,” the reply brief for the University reads.
Harvard also responded to the most recent allegations that the Law School violates Title VI and Title IX — federal anti-discrimination laws — in its faculty hiring processes. The University claimed that Title VI cannot be applied here because Harvard does not use federal funds primarily to provide employment, a stipulation of the law.
“Plaintiffs’ claim of race discrimination in faculty hiring also fails because Title VI does not cover hiring practices except where ‘a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance is to provide employment,’ … which is undisputedly not the case here,” the brief reads.
This lawsuit proceeds as a separate, high-profile lawsuit against Harvard’s undergraduate admissions policies draws to a close. A decision is expected in Mass. District Court in the coming weeks in the Students for Fair Admissions anti-affirmative action suit against the College. SFFA alleges the College has unfairly discriminated against Asian American applicants.

Five prominent Democratic presidential candidates fielded questions about everything from student loans to climate change at a town hall Monday evening co-hosted by CNN and Harvard’s Institute of Politics that featured an audience of young voters from more than 30 states.
United States Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg ’04 each spent an hour answering questions from audience members. CNN anchors Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo moderated the discussion.
Roughly 500 young voters attended, 200 of them from Harvard’s various schools. The town hall, held at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., coincided with the release of an IOP poll showing that more than a third of the voters in the 2020 election will be Millenial and Gen Z voters.
Prior to the event, students filled out an application that required them to submit three potential questions for each of the five candidates, as well as three general questions that could be asked of any of the five. Popular themes among the chosen questions included the cost of a college education and the burden of student debt, the looming perils of climate change, and the Mueller report and its investigation into President Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.

All of the candidates spoke about the need to reduce student debt and make higher education more financially accessible. Warren — who released her proposal to reduce student debt and to make public colleges tuition-free just hours before the town hall — said her plan would affect millions of Americans.
“Part one is that we say that we're going to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt,” said Warren, who is also a Harvard Law School professor emerita. “Part two is to make sure that we never get in this mess again on student loan debt and that is to make college universally available with free tuition and fees.”
The candidates also agreed that Trump must be further investigated, and some said Congress should strongly consider impeachment. Sanders, however, said he is concerned that conversations about impeachment could take away from discussion of other vital issues including climate change and minimum wage.
“If... we're not talking about health care, we're not talking about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, we're not talking about combating climate change, we're not talking about sexism and racism and homophobia, and all of the issues that concern ordinary Americans, what I worry about is that works to Trump's advantage,” Sanders said.
During his hour, Sanders faced a question about whether certain felons should retain their right to vote. Sanders said all citizens should be able to vote, a response that prompted some applause. But when Buttigieg answered the same question a few hours later in the negative, he received even greater applause.
The candidates also received questions about their plans to tackle climate change, and all said they support the goals of the Green New Deal, a progressive proposal that includes broad initiatives for tackling climate change.
Harris and Warren said outright they support the Green New Deal.
“[The Green New Deal] puts timelines in effect. It appreciates that we need to take this seriously and the clock is ticking every day on this issue, and every day we fail to act will be to our collective consequence,” Harris said.
Klobuchar did not directly say if she would support the deal but instead said she would bring back Obama-era environmental policies.
“As your president, on day one I would get us back into the international climate change agreement,” Klobuchar said. “On day two and day three, I would bring back the clean power rules that the Obama administration worked out that will make a big dent in this.”
“And I would propose sweeping legislations for green buildings and new ideas,” she added.
Students who attended said they appreciated having the chance to go to the event. The IOP rented four buses to shuttle students to and from New Hampshire Monday night, and paid for their dinners. Some students said they were not surprised the IOP sponsored such an event.
“I think that there's a lot of things that the IOP does like this. And given the connections that they have to the political world, it seemed very fitting,” said attendee Nicholas T. Wyville ’20.
Attendee Sean P. Quirk, a student at Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School who served as an officer in the U.S. Navy said he appreciated the format of the town halls.
“Because the town halls were back-to-back, we got to see some of the exact same questions answered from different candidates. And it created almost like a case study of how to answer a question or how not to,” Quirk said.
Fengyao “Diana” Ding ’20, who asked Harris a question, said she found the experience to be both “nerve-wracking” and exciting.
“I was like trembling for a solid minute,” she said. “It was really cool how the entire time it was basically just students asking questions… It really lived up to the spirit of what a town hall is supposed to be.”
Several students said the town hall could impact their vote during the Democratic primaries. Danielle Foltz ’20 said she thought Warren gave “direct” and “thorough” answers. She said she was also moved by Harris’s discussion of maternal mortality, a topic on which Foltz said she may write her thesis.
IOP President Anna L. Duffy ’21 said the IOP chose to co-host the event to “engage” and “excite” students. Nearly all of the students who received an offer to attend after applying accepted the invitation, Duffy said.
“I think that just says something about the enthusiasm for this event on Harvard's campus,” Duffy said. “Lately, we've been seeing actually a spike in terms of voter engagement among millennials, and our generation. So [co-hosting the event is] recognizing that and recognizing the influence that young people can have on politics today.”
Correction: April 24, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the IOP co-sponsored the town hall. In fact, it co-hosted the town hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Picture late 19th century Paris and a cat poster might come to mind, advertising a product that many will forget. After all, the image’s style is the important thing: clean lines, black ink. People often associate the image with Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, an influential painter who rose to prominence when the cat poster was created (the actual artist is Théohile-Alexandre Steinlen, by the way). Although Toulouse-Lautrec himself didn’t create it, that piece and many others are on display in the latest exhibition at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, “Toulouse-Lautrec and the Stars of Paris.” The exhibit captures the full range of the artist’s talents, situates it all in the context of his life and those of his contemporaries — and makes a trip to the museum well worth the commute. Though perhaps the adage “quality over quantity” ought to apply to most art exhibits, the MFA took these words too lightly over the past few months when curating many of its sparsely populated temporary exhibitions — but luckily, the same cannot be said for this one. Fans of Modernist French art should find themselves satisfied.
Toulouse-Lautrec is known for his more-than-friendly relationships with prostitutes, his alcoholism, and his posters that gave life to the at-times seedy underbelly of Paris. Amid a sea of his contemporaries, many of whom were poor and could barely make a living on their artistic talents, Toulouse-Lautrec was wealthy and his family subsidized his intended path. Unfortunately, he broke his legs in early childhood and never quite recovered. Toulouse-Lautrec felt like an outsider for the rest of his life, which presumably led him to feel comfortable mingling with other “outsiders” in Paris. The many sketches exhibited at the MFA, including a series titled “The Elles Portfolio,” are a testament to these close relationships: He depicts many women in intimate settings to which he would not have had access if he had not earned their trust. One particularly touching sketch depicts two women making a bed. It is unclear if they are prostitutes, but if they are, the act of making a bed humanizes women in an unforgiving and possibly isolating profession. 
Though he died in 1901 at the age of 36, Toulouse-Lautrec was incredibly prolific, producing more than 5,000 drawings and nearly 400 prints and posters. The MFA’s curation is a testament to his wide range of skills: Sketches are displayed next to oil paintings, posters, and watercolors. For his posters, the medium for which Toulouse-Lautrec is best known, he used a technique known as lithography, which involves drawing on a slab of stone with ink or greasy writing implement. The drawing is then affixed to the stone via chemical processes. When pressed onto paper, the image is the reverse of that on the stone. The MFA did a superb job of explaining the technique behind Toulouse-Lautrec’s artistic process. Certainly examining the art without background knowledge is possible, but the information spread throughout the exhibit, which also further contextualized the women he painted and befriended, was crucial for that extra touch: connecting to the art itself. 
It is likely a distinctly American perspective to believe that bigger is better, but this point of view is particularly true for art exhibitions. An exhibition requires a certain number of works — difficult to quantify, but it’s easy to tell when there are too few works of art on display — to effectively paint a picture of an artist’s life, their technique, style, and interests, and the people they knew that perhaps acted as influences for their work. The MFA’s exhibition is no exception, and finally breaks its recent tradition of displaying a paucity of works while relying on their respective flashiness and star power to carry the exhibition. (Looking at you, “Takashi Murakami: Lineage of Eccentrics” — the wall-length dragon mural might have been awe-inspiring, and the smiley-faced flower-patterned floor might have been an Instagram-worthy shot, but three or four singular works cannot propel an entire exhibition to success.) As for the cat poster that most people seem to recognize when they see it? It was here too, serving as a delightful way to further demonstrate the influence that Toulouse-Lautrec had during his lifetime. The wall placards, furthermore, humanized a man who likely never felt comfortable in Paris’s upper class. He may have been wealthy, but it is doubtful that those just as moneyed as him ever let him forget about his height — four-foot-eight — or his health problems. 
Frequent visitors to the MFA will be delighted to note that a permanent fixture from the Impressionist wing, “Antibes, The Pink Cloud” by Paul Signac, found a temporary home in this exhibition. Toulouse-Lautrec is not the only featured artist, though he is the focal point. Those interested in how others influenced him, or vice versa, can examine works by Maxime Lalanne, Auguste-Louis Lepère, Henri Rivière, and Pierre Bonnard, among others. That the curators at the MFA drew upon the Harvard Art Museums, their own archives, and other lenders, is a testament to the exhibit’s success. It showed their commitment to expanding the display’s focal point, which gives a visitor a pleasurable viewpoint into Paris, its (less-showcased and oft-ignored) inhabitants, and the artists who mingled with them to produce humanizing works of art that still have the power to move the viewer.

Through the countless ways in which Harvard students put off work, one website reigns supreme: Netflix. While Netflix viewers watch a wide variety of content, the large number of Netflix Original comedy specials have given stand-up comedy a new, wider audience. Anyone who wants to watch an hour-long program need not go to a live show; there are countless comedy specials available to distract you from your latest essay or problem set.
With so many specials available, viewers can easily be overwhelmed by the selection. Here are five specials that will surely keep you away from your work for a while.
1. Bo Burnham: Make Happy
In this special, Bo Burnham matures as a stand-up comedian. Burnham became famous for posting silly, often crude songs on YouTube. While “Make Happy” contains several hilarious songs, the special also dives into mental health and the toll that performing takes through its powerful final number. In several moments, Burnham’s previous special “what.” transcended comedy, imploring its audience to think about religion and fandom, along with several other topics. “Make Happy” is even more thoughtful than “what.,” resulting in a poignant comedy show. Watch “Make Happy.” You won’t regret it.
2. Hasan Minhaj: Homecoming King
A household name through his work on “The Daily Show” and now on “Patriot Act,” Hasan Minhaj delivered a standup special in 2017 that managed to be equally funny and poignant. During the special, Minhaj both mimics a six-year-old Drake and discusses his experience as a Muslim-American after 9/11. The special manages to make Minhaj’s very real and serious experiences with his identity in America funny without making fun of them. “Homecoming King” will make you burst out laughing and will make you reflect on your own experiences in America, regardless of who you are.
3. James Acaster: Repertoire
This special is made up of four hour-long episodes. The first three are unique, with the British comedian riffing on topics from language to free bananas. The fourth episode connects all of the ridiculous topics that Acaster discussed in the first three, serving as a satisfying conclusion to a masterful comedy series. Acaster has perfect timing and inflection throughout the special. As an example of his humor, Acaster jokes in the second episode of “Repertoire” that “I was raised Christian but I’m agnostic now, definitely.”
4. The Standups: Aparna Nancherla
In her episode of Netflix’s “The Standups,” a multi-part series consisting of various comedians doing 30-minute sets, Aparna Nancherla touches on airports, emojis, and several other topics. One of the highlights of the episode is a PowerPoint presentation on online dating and on her parents’ texting habits. Nancherla is on the rise as a comedian, and hopefully, there are plenty more specials to come.
5. John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City
One of the most popular stand-up comics in the world right now, John Mulaney released “Kid Gorgeous at Radio City” in 2018. While he has plenty of excellent specials, this one contains one of the comedian’s best bits: Mulaney riffing on the detective that his school hired yearly to tell the students about “stranger danger.” Mulaney describes that “he didn’t want us to not get kidnapped. He wanted us to almost get kidnapped and then fight the guy off using weird, psych-out, back-room Chicago violence.”

There’s been a lot of hype in the last few centuries or so of music history about colors. Artists from all genres can’t seem to get enough of what Wikipedia describes as a “characteristic of human visual perception.” Yet, among all the blue skies and purple hazes, one color indisputably rises to the top of our sonic palettes. With an eclectic variety of shades and a rich history from chlorophyll to DAPA, green hardly requires any introduction. Though its multifaceted legacy is impossible to capture in one article alone, enjoy this playlist as a chance to celebrate the musical legacy of arguably one of the greatest colors in the spectrum.
“Green & Gold” by Lianne La Havas
Le Havas sings a love song to the green and gold of Jamaica, weaving together strands of childhood nostalgia and rediscovery of ancestral roots. It’s worth suffering through YouTube targeted ads to behold the song’s music video, in what, for most, may be the most effervescent 3:33 of their lives. Even after the full effect of the song with video and brass section, “Green & Gold” is best experienced on La Havas’ acoustic remake of her sophomore album, “Blood,” where breathless vocals and dulcet fingerpicking are ever so sultry and tactile.
“green hill” (ft. Sonicberry Favour) by Strawberry Machine
For no explainable reason, there exists little scholarly discussion around Akira Okabe’s Shibuya-kei passion project, Strawberry Machine. Easily confused with the Waltham, Mass. “shoe-grass” indie band of the same name, Japan’s Strawberry Machine collaborates here with the equally elusive Sonicberry Favour, whose only album seems to be the 2004 "Epiqurean 4D Garden.” The track itself, “green hill” is more than a niche music flex — but a joyous mix of dreamy bilingual vocals, tinny machine breakbeats, and sunny-day acoustic guitar is crisp like a green apple on a spring morning.
“Little Green” by Joni Mitchell
Sure, the album may be called Blue, but we all know that Joni’s true alliances lay with another color. “Little Green” is green like an old recipe for pea soup made with not single, but double cream. With its crocuses, acoustic guitar and fading winter, the song bears all the symptoms of spring, yet the muted morose hints at a yearning that brings listeners to press play long after leaves have drifted off their branches.
“Green Light” by Lorde
A rare breed of sonic green is the Comeback Green, demonstrated here with panache by the pop survivalist Lorde. Let’s be clear here — “Royals” was a veritable feast, and, if she liked, Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O’Connor could have been done with it all, and focused her powerful mind on her more niche interests, like her secret Instagram account for reviewing onion rings. Yet, like a phoenix, she rose, and “Green Light” is the triumphant result. Crossing roads will never be the same again.
“Village Green” by The Kinks
In the spirit of gender inclusivity, this playlist includes some work by long-suffering male artists. The Kink’s sixth studio album, “The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society” never entered the canon quite like some of their other endeavors, nevertheless “Village Green” is a fascinating relic from a time when it was commonplace to use a harpsichord in rock songs. The track is great to listen to when struggling with the cost of fame — listeners can long for the simple life of rural Devonshire with Ray Davies (who, incidentally, was born in suburban London.) As the great man Davies said himself, “Everybody’s got their own village green, somewhere you go to when the world gets too much."
“Fantasia on Greensleeves” by Ralph Vaughan Williams
Up-and-comer Ralph Vaughan Williams (known affectionately by fans as RVW) is undoubtedly one of the top male artists to watch in 2019, capturing ears and hearts with this groundbreaking acoustic remix of the Henry VIII classic, Greensleeves. Jokes aside, Greensleeves is obviously the classic green. Picture the scene: The rolling pastures of England, babbling brooks, maybe a thatched mill gently circling on the horizon — you, a maiden fair, skin brushing past resting lambs and soft grass as your dark-eyed lover beckons from a distance. The recording of choice here is Neville Marriner with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, but let’s be honest, it sounds just as good on that Top 50 Classical Music for Sleep playlist you doze off to every night.

The cacophony of unnecessary squelching and the ungodly banging of doors and drawers in “The Curse of La Llorona” are enough to give anyone a migraine. As the new director taking charge of “The Conjuring” series, director Michael Chaves fails to bring audiences the same thrilling experience that fans of the first and second “Conjuring” films are accustomed to from James Wan, the series’ former director. The sixth installment in the Conjuring Universe, “The Curse of La Llorona” is a disappointment. In the past, Wan crafted haunted atmospheres that paralyzed viewers as they were immersed in the spiritual journey of characters. “The Curse of La Llorona,” however, is plagued by dull storytelling, and Chaves does not nearly match the caliber of Wan’s past work.
The film hinges on an old and fascinating piece of Mexican folklore. “La Llorona,” or “The Weeping Woman,” is a Mexican folklore tale used to scare children into obeying their parents. Legend has it that La Llorona was originally a young woman named Maria who married a wealthy nobleman and gave birth to two boys. When Maria found her husband with a younger woman, she exacted revenge on him by drowning their sons because they were what her husband cared about the most. After realizing what she had done, she killed herself in despair. She remains on the cusp of the living and the afterlife, attempting to drown other children in order to get hers back. While this sounds like a reasonable backstory to motivate any distraught ghost in a horror movie and is a fascinating and chilling tale on its own, the bland execution of this film is the real curse, and an injustice to the actual myth of La Llorona.
The film centers around Los Angeles in the ’70s. A recently-widowed mother named Anna (Linda Cardellini) works as a social worker for Child Protective Services as she struggles to adapt to the single-mother lifestyle and raise her children Chris (Roman Christou) and Samantha (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). Anna’s involvement with La Llorona begins with one of Anna’s cases: Patricia Alvarez (Patricia Velasquez), a mother whose sons haven’t been to school for a few days. When Anna checks on the family, the boys are nowhere to be seen. She realizes that Patricia has her sons locked inside of a closet, so she arrests Patricia and sends her sons to foster care. Patricia maintains that she was just protecting her sons, and it’s very clear that all three of them are scared of an outside agent and not each other — something that a more nuanced social worker would be able to sense. The film picks up pace when, after Patricia and her children are separated, her boys are found dead. As Anna rushes to the crime scene, she brings her children with her (her first mistake — what mother brings her children with her to the scene of a potential murder?). At the crime scene, Chris comes into contact with the culprit, La Llorona — a sobbing woman in a dirty wedding gown damp with muddy water — as she chooses him as her next victim.
La Llorona's appearances in the film become tiresome and predictable, as viewers begin to associate the strong gusts of wind with her arrival. The lack of variation in jump scares and tension-building sequences also detract from the film, which would have been a more thrilling sensory experience if Chaves had enhanced La Llorona’s powers instead of only focusing on her robotic impulse to kill the children by drowning them. Throughout the film, La Llorona has the power to telekinetically move things, control people’s actions, control the tenacity of the wind, and inflict harm burning her victims with her touch, but Chaves never develops these terrifying capacities further. While Chaves remains loyal to the legend of La Llorona, the audience knows that nothing truly bad will happen unless the characters are near a body of water. This limitation makes the children’s harrowing encounters with La Llorona on dry land anticlimactic and much less suspenseful than they could have been.
However, this film did have a few redeeming qualities. It’s one of the few popular films to center on an aspect of Latin American culture, which is otherwise sorely underrepresented in Hollywood. Chaves also manages to get a few spectacular scenes in the film. In one moment, the camera’s movements match the gust of wind blowing at the door upon La Llorona’s arrival, giving the scene a voyeuristic perspective as the audience moves with the wind. The fact that La Llorona freely follows the family around wherever they go heightens the uncertainty that the characters and audience feel.
“La Llorona” is ultimately an average horror film at best. It’s a relatively good match for those seeking the adrenaline rush of jump scares — of which this film has no shortage — but are too squeamish to expect convoluted, truly terrifying plot twists. Ultimately, the film lacks a substantive plot, and barely matches a viewer’s lowest expectations.

From looking at course syllabi alone, one might believe that poetry can only be written by people who have been dead for 50 years. However, there’s a whole generation of writers out there creating work, right now. Here are five living poets worthy of your attention.

Ocean Vuong
Through striking images and beautiful language, Vietnamese-American poet Ocean Vuong explores his family history, the effects of war and trauma, and the complicated dynamics of love. Vuong’s collection “Night Sky with Exit Wounds” is a great place to start for anyone who wants to start reading poetry. Try his poem “Someday I’ll Love Ocean Vuong” or his essay “A Letter to My Mother That She Will Never Read” in the New Yorker. Vuong’s first novel, “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous,” is set to come out June 4.
Ada Limón
Ada Limón’s grasp of place, her quiet revelations, and her flowing, narrative style make her work relatable. Limón’s most recent collection, “The Carrying,” is incredible, as is her 2015 collection “Bright Dead Things.” To get a taste of her work, read her poems “The Leash” and “A New National Anthem”.
Warsan Shire
Warsan Shire explores themes of femininity, immigration, and belonging with a direct narrative style. Her 2011 collection “Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth” is as striking as its title. Online, try her poems “Backwards” and “Conversations About Home (At the Deportation Centre)”.
Richard Siken
The cinematic imagery, strong narrative voice, and dreamlike quality of Richard Siken’s writing pull the reader directly into the confusion and desperation of love. Siken’s first collection, “Crush,” embodies this frenzied energy with a scattered aesthetic, while the poems in his later collection, “War of the Foxes,” feel more settled. Read “Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out” or “You Are Jeff” to get a taste for his work.
Maggie Nelson
One of Nelson’s most special works is “Bluets,” a collection of connected fragments exploring love and loss through an obsession with the color blue. Read an excerpt from “Bluets” or one of her individual poems, “Thanksgiving.”

“Avengers: Infinity War,” and “Avengers: Endgame": If you’re not in the loop, you would be forgiven for not knowing the difference between the two, or wondering how own earth these two movies could be released within a year of each other. The latter is this year’s iteration, continuing the Marvel saga and, if you’re a betting person, likely not the end of a saga that appears to be stretching on indefinitely. Of course each movie will have its own distinct plot, as did their predecessors, but one has to wonder: Is this really the best that Hollywood can do? Have producers, directors, actors, and everyone else run out of ideas? The answer, given the preponderance of evidence, is yes.
“Avengers: Infinity War” was not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. Prevailing opinion says that overproduction of such movies is what audiences want, especially given box office profit, and one could easily say that high-grossing movies justify continuing a series indefinitely. But what would audiences do if the series ended? Would people really stop going to the movies just because Hollywood execs (mercifully) decided to wrap up the series? That’s doubtful; like Noah’s ark, if you build it, they will come.
It’s not an issue of quality as much as it is of originality. Sure, the movies might be good, yet producing them at the expense of new scripts and hot takes stifles creativity and fails to push the boundaries of exciting cinema. The same can be said of this July’s upcoming second rendition of “The Lion King:” Yes, it stars Beyoncé and Donald Glover, and yes, it will probably be a good movie, but do we really need it? What need is it fulfilling other than taking the original story beyond the confines of animation? Even that need is a questionable one.
It’s an issue because it suggests laziness on the parts of Hollywood execs, and doesn’t encourage boundary-pushing in any way. Where should writers with new, interesting, and thought-provoking scripts turn to if Hollywood cannot be an outlet for them? Sure, they can find funding or support outside of Hollywood, but that could automatically limit their exposure, which merely entrenches the dichotomy between new, original work and high-grossing films. And while box office profits can be used as evidence for the claim that audiences don’t want originality, maybe consumers don’t really have a choice. Present new creative content, and let the chips fall where they may.

Sundays were Luciana’s favorite days. In her memory, the most important events have always happened on Sunday.
The Sunday her first daughter was born, Luciana asked the nurse in her miniscule hospital room for a Bible and took mass there, eyelids half open and undulating between the reality of starched bed sheets and the hazy lighting of her unconscious.
Her mother died on a Sunday, worn wood rosary beads trembling on parched, diseased lips as they sang in croaking melody her final song of penitence. Just 15 years old, Luciana still remembers feeling the veins in her small hands, trying to find God in the blue green branches stretching across her mother’s holy skin.
Sundays. Her mother died mourning the life of a bastard child beginning and her daughter choked her first breaths while a breathless girl was born in the room next door.
Death to birth to passing to resurrection, together in a dizzying cycle.
This Sunday, Luciana sits in the fourth pew from the front, left side, of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Doral, Florida. She clutches her mother’s rosary, daintily manicured fingers swiping in a halting merengue over the araguaney wood.
“Children of God.”
Luciana’s hazel eyes, encircled by thin laugh lines, stare raptly at the bald-headed man draped in ornamental white at the front of the church. She sees nothing else.
“Brothers and Sisters in Worship and in Venezuela’s Eyes.”
The church is filled with light, fluorescent beams intersecting stained glass mosaics and birthing fantastical shows of dancing color. They remind Luciana of the crisscrossing reds, pinks, and blues of the Iglesia de Santisima Trinidad in Caracas.
“Today we mourn our people as they wait in darkness after five days. We pray that God illuminate their lives and end these blackouts. We pray for electricity, that God may provide for them what the dictatorship takes. The Lord tells us—"
God whispers and, before Luciana can tear her eyes from Padre Rivera, the church goes dark.
Luciana’s first thought is that she has gone blind. She blinks, clutches her rosary tighter, and then registers the chaos surrounding her.
Screams melt into sobs melt into babies’ warbled cries until everything intertwines in a sickening audial portrait, notes of tortured ghouls and wailing mothers the same in a landscape suggesting coupled brushstrokes of Dali and Goya.
“Maria? Maria, dónde estás?!”
“Coño, esto es, es el final del mundo.”
“Dios, por favor, no hagas como en Maracaibo.”
Luciana stumbles to her feet, hands reaching out to hold the wooden pews in front of her. She feels movement on all sides, bodies pushing and thrashing and assaulting so she stops feeling where her hips begin and the woman’s next to her end, which is her hand, where is the rosary, God please, don’t let me lose this rosary, this is all I have, not my mother’s rosary.
There is a sound like a firecracker and then, the heat comes. Heat so heavy it weighs on Luciana’s shoulders, a cross made of her country’s sins, heat that rivals the worst days in the barrios of Petare and tells Luciana at once where she is. The thought stands more solid than any she has ever had.
Caracas once again.
On her left, Luciana hears the crashing of glass and men’s strained voices. There are curses and leaping yells, sound of desperation so grotesque she can feel the stretched veins and splintering vocal chords.
More screams, feminine, and a litany of “no”s. Somewhere, Luciana swears she can hear the beginning of a plea, to God or to looters or to the deity that unites both, as a man rattles off facts faster than the best radio host.
“Please, please, we’ve had this store since 1975, we’re never looking for trouble, please, I have a daughter and a granddaughter, please, this is everything I have, I —”
The group of men’s voices, hyenas with snapping jaws, crash and rise, and the lone objector goes mute with a thud.
On her right, a voice wavers like a candle in its last minutes of flame. It is riding waves of melody, unsteady sailboat in search of music but always falling short as the hull runs ashore on the dried seas of its dehydrated body. Luciana clutches her pew harder, standing still and straight while surrounded by motion in some kind of sick miracle.
The voice crests and finally, she can make out the words.
“Yo nací en esta ribera del Arauca vibrador, soy hermana de la espuma, de las garzas, de las rosas y del sol.”
The voice repeats the verse and is joined by another, incoherent and hungry and yearning. A cry rises in pitch and volume and Luciana tries to make out the llanero lullaby, only single words trickling out before being drowned by the insistent lament of a child destined for death in the throes of starvation.
Luciana pushes herself to find the melody again.
Yo nací en esta —
Child’s cries grow and become the frenzied pants of the hyena men.
Yo nací —
Find the melody, Luciana.
Yo —
Zigzag laughs blend with the sounds of crashing glass, the baby’s cry underscoring all in a frantic dissonance that give Luciana death, only death, where is the birth, it is Sunday, death always comes with birth, where is it God, please, how can you give me a country constantly dying, how much death can I take before I follow in suit, diving into hyena screaming jungles, plagued by bursting bellies of air and colectivo guns prodding where they shouldn’t and darkness, stretching darkness, where are the lights, when will they come back, too much heat, heat and darkness and pain and hell.
Another firecracker yell and then, silence.
It is no longer hot and she is no longer in hell. As Luciana registers the concerned faces hovering over her, feels the carpeted ground of the church beneath her spine, she wonders if Sundays will ever be her favorites again.

For too long, streaming supergiant Netflix has sat on the throne. It has easily conquered competitors like Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, effectively holding the monopoly on streaming services — and basking in it. Netflix has all the power and clout imaginable (see: “Netflix and chill,” “Bird Box” memes, and their 130 million paid subscribers), and they don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.
At least, that’s what Disney implied when the multi-billion dollar conglomerate said “no more” and announced their own streaming service. By November of this year, the company will launch Disney+, a service that will provide access to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Pixar, the Star Wars franchise, and over 7,500 TV episodes, including episodes from beloved TV series like “Hannah Montana” and “That’s So Raven.”
There is no doubt that Disney is a force to be reckoned with. Their ownership over huge corporations like 21st Century Fox adds to their seemingly infinite library of films and television shows, many of which are critically acclaimed and popular among a global audience. The acquisition of Fox included a majority shareholder position over Hulu, another streaming service that the company will pair with Disney+. And even just the accessibility of all things Disney will be a major advantage for the company. After almost 100 years of entertainment, it will be difficult not to get viewers to subscribe.
For Disney, this is the perfect time to introduce their latest innovation. Unemployment is low and consumption is high, which is all the more reason to introduce a streaming service that is only $6.99 a month, a cheap alternative compared to Netflix’s premium monthly subscription at $15.99.
Disney will also provide original content as well as previously produced shows and movies. The service will have classics like “Cinderella” and “The Simpsons” and popular films like “Black Panther” and “Ratatouille.” And Disney is promising original content as well, with shows such as “High School Musical: The Series” and a star Wars-based series called “The Mandalorian” set to premiere with the launch of the streaming service.
Disney’s greatest advantage is that they are not only bringing classics and original content, but they also have a reputation established almost 100 years ago. Their plethora of shows and movies, their well-known reputation for producing incredible animation movies, and the possible accessibility of nostalgic TV shows are all pluses for the company as they embark on this trip.
But one can’t help but wonder what will become of Netflix and other streaming services once Disney+ hits the ground running. Will they co-exist peacefully? Will one rise above the rest? Will Disney eventually buy Netflix like it has been doing with everything else? With Disney+’s launch more than half a year away, we’ll have to wait and see.

Maybe you’ve dabbled in various music genres, or maybe you stick with what plays on your local Top 40 station. Regardless of your music preferences, give blues a chance if you haven’t already. One of America’s most iconic music genres, blues is both integral to and reflective of this country’s DNA. Enjoy these songs, which show the range of what blues has to offer.
Listen to the playlist here.
“Coming Home” by Leon Bridges
Leon Bridges, a modern day blues genius, has a silky voice that will leave you with a grin on your face. This soft, beautiful, bright song will keep you grounded and focused while you work.
“Lovely Day” by Bill Withers
Is Bill Withers really blues? Not all the songs on this playlist fall under the constricted view of what most people think blues is. Blues is a family of many genres — including Withers’ funky and upbeat songs. “Lovely Day” will inspire you to carpe diem, smile at the sun, and dance in your seat.
“Soul Man” by Sam & Dave
Another blues outlier! This one is a great way to start your day. Sam & Dave’s funky and cheerful song will get you up and dancing no matter where you are. Move your feet! Get going! and Watch this short and beloved clip of Drake and Josh’s rendition of the song.
“A Sunday Kind of Love” by Etta James
Here’s a classic Sunday song by the “Matriarch of R&B,” Etta James. This song, which will help you look past your Saturday mistakes and fall in love with the Sunday ahead of you. When you’re not in the mood for the complicated beats of EDM, allow Etta’s honey-like vocals to help you relax.
“Mannish Boy” by Muddy Waters 
This playlist celebrates outliers like Bill Withers, but it also embraces deeply rooted and classic blues artists like Muddy Waters. This song is not as soothing as those Bridges or Etta, but it will get you hype, yet relaxed to get stuff done. Muddy starts his song by reassuring you that “Everything’s gonna be alright this morning.” He’s a wise man.
“Feeling Good” by Nina Simone

“Here We Go Again” by Ray Charles and Norah Jones
This is a rendition of Ray Charles’ song sung by an absolutely iconic duo: Ray Charles, “The Father of Soul,” and another modern blues artist with stunning vocals, Norah Jones. Both these singers have mellifluous vocals that will motivate you to get through the day even though you’re thinking, “Here We Go Again.”
“Drown in My Own Tears” by Ray Charles
Even if you may feel like you’re about to drown in your own tears, Ray’s beautiful lyrics will help you get through this hard time.
“(What A) Wonderful World” by Sam Cooke
Like Cooke says: “Don't know much about history. Don't know much biology. Don't know much about a science book, don't know much about the French I took.” You might feel lost in the work that you really don’t know much about, so bask in Cooke’s mellow lyrics and vocals.
“At Last” by Etta James
Another classic Etta song that is perhaps most appropriate when finishing that last piece of math p-set you have to do. Etta is a true artist and will make you want to bask in the warmth of her voice. “The skies above are blue” and you can carry on with your day.

A small cast and crew of undergraduates are bringing “The Diary of Anne Frank” to the Loeb Experimental Theater on April 26. The story of the 13-year-old girl in hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands has long been an emblem for the suffering of the Jewish people in the Holocaust. Director Gregory E. Lipson ’20 seeks to present an intimate picture of the Frank family’s two years of concealment in this eternally relevant and true story.
Adapted from Anne Frank’s remarkable diary, the play, written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, premiered on Broadway in 1955. It won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1956.
“The Diary of Anne Frank” marks the fourth Harvard production that Lipson, a Theater, Dance & Media concentrator, has directed. In order to capture the claustrophobic quality of the tiny annex –– the upper rooms of Otto Frank’s business in which his family hid — Lipson opted to present the play in the round.
“There’s this very fascinating juxtaposition in the play: These are people who are desperately trying to be seen by the people around them in the annex,” Lipson said. “At the same time, if they’re seen by the outside world, they will literally die. And there aren’t really higher stakes than that. So, I wanted to see if there was a way to highlight that juxtaposition by actually having them being watched on all sides throughout the play.”
For Judy F. Durkin ’22, playing Anne Frank is a way of honoring her story. “I first read the diary when I was 13 –– the same age that Anne was when she went into hiding,” Durkin said. “I think what the diary does for Anne is it gives her this outlet to share all of her feelings so that she can then exist among everybody else, but still get it out of her system.”
While the plot follows the events described in her diary, the majority of the direct quotations from Anne’s entries are done in voiceover during scene changes. Lipson chose to incorporate expressionistic movement during these transitions to give reverence to Anne’s narrative voice. “What is a way that I can really elevate these voiceovers and make something out of them so that they’re not just clunky transitions?” Lipson said he asked himself. “I think these transitions do a really good job of letting you focus on what Anne is saying. They also, to an extent, punctuate the scenes.”
Ben I. Ubiñas ’19 plays Mr. Dussel, a dentist who joins the group in hiding and shares a room with Anne. When asked about the play’s resonance today, Ubiñas said, “Of course, people feel empathy for Anne Frank, but the in-your-face, blatant understanding of the human cost of scapegoating, marginalization, persecution –– these sorts of things that are coming back –– it’s a message that matters.”
In the lobby of the Ex, there will be an educational display of Nazi propaganda –– a gesture that Lipson and members of the crew considered especially important. “We are trying to connect the show as well to the present day in which there’s a lot of propaganda and fake news,” Lipson said. “I’m not trying to make the play relevant by changing any lines or adding anything in. I think the material is relevant in itself. I’m just hoping that people walk away from the show and have a conversation with someone, whether it’s about Anne Frank specifically or about anti-Semitism in the world.”
“The Diary of Anne Frank” will run April 26 through May 4 in the Loeb Ex.

It’s 9 p.m. in the SOCH a couple of weeks before the premiere of “Cruising Altitude,” and a group of artistically-inclined freshmen have made the intrepid hike to the Quad for rehearsal. This year’s iteration of the annual First-Year Musical, developed over the course of the year, runs from May 2 to 5 in Agassiz Theatre and has been entirely written, performed, produced, and directed by freshmen, from the core concept to minutiae of stage management.
“This year’s edition we went totally out of the box,” Samuel A. Thau ’22, one of the co-producers, said. “It’s all set on one very long plane flight from Houston to Heathrow… but everything goes totally sideways, and it turns into a kind of whodunnit mystery.”
Though the entire show is set in one location, “Cruising Altitude” has no lack of excitement. Its protagonists are a young couple, Peter and Jenny, aboard a flight to London. Peter’s plans to propose are foiled when he finds the luggage containing the ring has disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Chaos ensues from that point onwards, embroiling the flight’s eclectic passengers in a high-altitude take on kitchen-sink drama.
The annual froshical is an important opportunity for freshmen to showcase their talents, from the lead performers to the creatives who brought the concepts to life.
“A huge part of the production was trying to figure out how we could mimic a plane on a stage,” Esther Caroline ’22 said, also a co-producer. “Our set designer, Serena [D. Chen ’22], designed this incredible set with two airplane wings on stage.”
“It gives the feel of being on a plane, but still with some suspension of disbelief,” Caroline said.
For many working on the show, “Cruising Altitude” was their first opportunity to work on a large scale musical theatre production.
“I didn’t do any musical theatre in high school at all,” Odessa X. Deng ’22, who stars as Jenny Murray, said. “It was always a goal entering into college to do musical theatre.”
“Something that was really important to us was getting people of all different backgrounds in terms of theatre experience,” director Aviva L. Ramirez ’22 said. “We have this opportunity to introduce ourselves to the theatre community at Harvard and say ‘Hi, I’m here, I’m competent, and here’s something that I made that I’m proud of.’"
Ramirez had never directed a show before “Cruising Altitude.” “Now I’m planning to direct two shows next year,” she said.
Despite the opening night drawing near, cast and crew are relaxed about the upcoming performance. “It’s actually been running incredibly smoothly,” Caroline said. “Things have just been clicking, and it’s totally down to the incredible staff.”
Indeed, it is clear that they work as a tight-knit creative unit. “Even if you have to meet at like, 1 a.m. with ten minute notice because something crazy is happening, no one is ever bitter because we just enjoy spending time with each other,” Ramirez said. “The people on staff and in the cast are some of my closest friends on campus.”
At the core of “Cruising Altitude” is the community that has formed around it, with each cast and crew member truly dedicated to realizing a spectacular performance. “It's hard to tone down how proud I am of this show,” Caroline said. “It’s a group of 50 freshmen who didn’t really know each other before it started, and we’ve really become a family. We’ve been putting in hours and hours and hours — and the result is really just phenomenal.”

Between performing at the Student Organization Center at Hilles, opening for Yardfest, and releasing their debut mixtape “Harlem Nights,” student musicians Michael A. Osei ’21 (“MJangles”) and Lincoln A. Hart ’21 have a lot to juggle outside of the classroom. The co-founders of the music collective Maybe There’s Life sat down with The Harvard Crimson to chat about their whirlwind of a year.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you both start writing music or producing music?
Michael A. Osei: I think like junior year of high school in 2015. I mostly wrote over whatever beats I thought sounded cool. I remember the first song I ever wrote was to [the beat of] “California Love” by 2Pac. My first original song was senior year of high school.
Lincoln A. Hart: I was an instrumentalist and songwriter before I started recording. My father taught me how to play guitar, and I grew up [playing] in jazz bands. When I got to high school, I started getting more involved with rapping and freestyle. I taught myself how to produce just for myself so I wouldn't be reliant on other people. Senior year of high school is when I really started producing beats for myself, but it wasn't until my freshman year here that I became committed to not using any other person's beats to make the songs that I produce.
THC: You both have your own albums as solo musicians. When did you begin Maybe There’s Life together?
MAO: Lincoln and I have often talked about just having complete ownership and creative control over our content for perpetuity of our careers. Then he introduced me to the third member of Maybe There's Life, Tobias Defoe, who's a student and full time musician in New York. The idea of it was solidified this past summer because we were working on music from time to time, and we thought what if we just come together? Then we had our record label launch in December 2018. We had a big performance in the Quad, and that was like the official announcement of Maybe There's Life on this campus.
LAH: We want to make sure it's clear that we are fully solo artists within our own rights. We all view the collective of Maybe There's Life as an opportunity to stand together in solidarity against the forces of the music industry and to be fully autonomous as artists and performers.
THC: What is your creative process like together?
LAH: I think what makes our collab tape that's coming out on Saturday, “Harlem Nights,” so unique is that it's so truly collaborative in every aspect of it. It's not just one person making the beat, another person writing lyrics, and the other person writing the melody. Every drum pattern, every drum sound, every chord, every rhythm, every lyric is three people fully hashing it out.
THC: What is the message you’re trying to send with your music?
MAO: I make music for the people who have grown up in situations where they were consistently told that there's a certain path of success that they need to follow — often, namely being like a doctor, lawyer, or professor — and you just can't help but dream of that other calling.
LAH: We're storytellers, and I can’t think of my artistic mission as one concrete story. Musically, a lot of my artistic purpose is pushing boundaries and speaking about spaces in between extremes.
THC: How do you see yourselves pursuing your musical careers here, at Harvard, and then beyond Harvard?
MAO: I know that all I'm meant to do on this earth is to make music, challenge people's thought processes, and inspire them to try to shape their own futures. I plan on just continuing to make as much music as possible in that room up there and put on as many performances as possible until I reach a point where I'm able to go beyond this campus and go across the world.
THC: Do you feel that so much is expected of Harvard students you face judgment from other students or people who look down on you?
MAO: I’ve written a whole song about it called HUID! I'm not sure about students in particular on this campus judging in a negative light.
LAH: I think a lot of [the judgement we receive] stems from people's conception of what a rapper is. They think that it's fun work. There's this image of people chilling in a studio, doing mad drugs, saying some random stuff over a beat, and calling it a day. That's so uncharacteristic of the kind of work we're doing. I've never worked harder on any single project or anything in my life. It's 32 minutes of music in four weeks. It's not glamorous work all the time. I think that, Mike and I, what we're trying to do is about what real hip hop is and what it started out to do. It’s purpose was to educate and uplift the community.
THC: Do you guys feel you're uplifting Harvard? How was your performance at YardFest and in the Quad in December? How did it feel being able to perform to Harvard students?
MAO: It was exhilarating to be able to perform for that many people. I never had a crowd of 1,500 to 2,000 people with a stage that epic looking.
LAH: It's a cool thing, if you ever have been to our events, to see a lot of different kinds of people from a lot of different kinds of places. Especially given Harvard's context of extreme exclusivity, there should be a space that's free, that everyone is welcome to, and that is all about student voice.

The spring 2019 Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll found that voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are experiencing anxiety and have increasingly voiced concern about the moral direction of the United States.
Conducted by the Harvard Public Opinion Project, the biannual poll surveyed more than 3,000 individuals nationwide. The survey also revealed that the youth vote will likely play a significant role in the 2020 presidential election.
While the poll did not find a significant link between anxiety and partisan affiliation, anxiety was correlated to views about the nation’s civic health. Forty-eight percent of young Americans — irrespective of political affiliation — reporting having experienced anxiety within the 24 hour period before the poll was conducted. Fifty-nine percent of respondents who strongly agreed that “politics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing” reported experiencing anxiety. Only 29 percent who strongly disagreed with that statement experienced anxiety.
John Della Volpe, the IOP's director of polling, said in a press release about the fnidings that candidates need to better understand the stress and anxiety that young voters face in order to connect with them.
“It is no secret that social media has exacerbated the stress and anxiety that is already so prevalent in the late-teen and early-adulthood years of young Americans,” Della Volpe said in the press release. “However, for the first time, we now have evidence that the state of our politics is contributing to the mental health challenges millions of young Americans already face.”
In addition to high rates of anxiety, the poll found that young Americans are worried about the deteriorating moral state of the nation.
“We can watch that concern over the country’s morals trending steadily upward since this point in 2015,” Richard M. Sweeney ’21, student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, said in interview following the results' release.
Sweeney also said he was surprised to find that near-equal percentages of Democrats and Republicans agreed with the statement “I am concerned about the moral direction of the country,” with 66 percent and 64 percent agreement respectively.
“What did surprise me was that when you broke this down by party, this concern is relatively broad based – it cuts across party lines,” Sweeney said. “Young people of all stripes are really looking for leaders that can bring morality back to Washington.”
Della Volpe said in an interview that another key finding was the tension that appears to exist between young voters and baby boomers, which survey organizers defined as people ages 55 to 73. Only 18 percent of survey respondents agreed that voters within the baby-boom cohort care about people like them.
“I think we’re beginning to see a generational conflict between younger voters and baby boomers brewing,” Della Volpe said.
One of the issues that may contribute to this generational conflict is environmental policy, according to Della Volpe. Forty-six percent of respondents agreed that the government should be more proactive in curbing the effects of climate change, even at the expense of economic growth – a substantial increase over previous years’ findings.
“Protecting the environment – dealing with climate change – is now central to both the domestic and well as the foreign policy agenda of young Americans,” Della Volpe said.
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said in the press release that the results of the youth poll – and the voices of youth voters – should inform the actions of candidates in the upcoming presidential election.
“This presidential election serves as a consequential moment in time to shape how young Americans engage in politics and I hope candidates thoughtfully listen and engage with their agenda,” Gearan said.

Khalid’s much-anticipated sophomore album “Free Spirit” picks up right where his previous EP “Suncity” left off — with Khalid leaning on the ripe side of the thin line between boyishness and manhood. With singles like “Talk” and “My Bad” hinting at the album’s general exploration of Khalid’s love life, the buildup to the album’s release was simultaneously accurate and misleading — accurate in how representative it was of the album’s overall aesthetic, yet misleading in its erasure of the darker, wiser aspects of the album that weren’t fully fleshed out, if invoked at all, in “American Teen” and “Suncity.” Though “Free Spirit” more often than not falls into the generic pop trap, a few hidden gems suggest Khalid’s personal and artistic growth.
For all his apparent romantic foibles, Khalid recycles parallel, if not indistinguishable, experiences in his love life that make for a homogenous — and almost tiresomely cohesive — album. The first and perhaps strongest song on the album, “Intro,” is one such (starcrossed) love song that avoids falling into the aforementioned trap. This has much to do with its “cinematic” quality, as Khalid himself describes it. The track is essentially a repetition of lingering, electric riffs that bleed into one another, like the different aspects of Khalid’s personal life, from romance to mental health. Khalid’s sweeping vocals complement the instrumentals seamlessly, the perfect backdrop for mournful lyrics about prioritizing himself after a love lost. “Couldn’t have known it would ever be this hard / Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault,” he sings. “But I'm never giving up on word, I've been / I've been focusing on putting me first.”
Khalid’s honesty is at first refreshing; that is, until he dives into another retelling of a similarly endured relationship — and another, and another. By the next song, “Bad Luck,” Khalid warns that “Now, if you're gonna leave me / You better run far away / I’d hate for you to leave me attached.” In “My Bad,” he takes slight responsibility for his own role in the same (or not) relationship: “Blowin' me up, you've been wildin' / We was cool, yeah, we was vibin' / Gotta put my phone on silent / So my, my, my, my bad.” The recurring theme crops up throughout the rest of the album, from “Right Back” and “Don’t Pretend” to “Bluffin’” and “Heaven” toward the album’s end, making for an ultimately underwhelming, uninspiring motif.
Khalid’s strengths emerge, like in his previous LP “American Teen,” in the spaces that lie between his struggle to cope with growing both a little and a lot older and the ensuing lessons he’s learned. Nowhere is this more subtly and almost misleadingly represented than in “Paradise.” The psychedelic instrumentals belie nostalgia for a more innocent time in Khalid’s life, when he didn’t have to face the future head on. “Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray / All your wrongs from yesterday / Smokin’ himalayan haze / Won’t wash all your sins away,” he rings in falsetto register. The wise words that follow speak to the contemplation and self-exploration Khalid has endured; for all the changes he’s experienced post-”American Teen,” the young pop star still prioritizes enjoying the slower, more mindless moments of life: “All the dollars you’ll spend / Give it up for nights like this / Don’t give into overthinking / Pour a drink when it ends.” In a similar vein, the less impressive “Hundred” nonetheless evokes his reconciliation with moving forward despite wanting to revel in the little things. “'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face / I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today,” Khalid sings.
Khalid further explores his vulnerability when discussing how he’s grappled with his mental health. Unsurprisingly, like the song “Self,” “Free Spirit”’s strongest, most introspective songs are also the most sonically interesting. The track’s underlying, nearly eerie riff enhances the anxiety Khalid expresses and has been coping with. “I've ran away for miles / It's gettin' hard for me to breathe / 'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me,” he sings. Appearing toward the album’s end, it’s a refreshing change to the monotonous drove of unsuccessful relationships he lists. Unfortunately, the album skews more toward the latter than the former. It seems that for all he’s learned, Khalid has yet to perfect the thematic balance “Free Spirit” lacks.

Ruben: We have written twenty-three columns about aspects of Harvard that are unjust and have made us feel small: Racist assumptions about our intelligence and admission to Harvard; being the curricula for our white classmates; being exotified; how Harvard was never built or imagined for people like us; students’ treatment of custodial and dining staff; machismo; The Crimson; and wearing ourselves down for others. For more than three years, we’ve tried speaking truth to power and written columns to help make this campus a bit more equitable, a bit softer.
But, if you seek the most complete account of our time here, you have to remember the joy we felt — a necessary antidote to the bitter poison we faced. Sometimes they came in small bursts, sometimes large ones, but either way they sustained us.
Zoe: Laughter, that’s how I’d describe my highest moments at Harvard. Moments caught between the craziness of college, when time didn’t seem to matter as much and I didn’t notice the responsibilities nagging at me. It felt free, to laugh without inhibition or restriction. Friends who became family, who picked me up in the lowest of moments and made me crack a smile when I wasn’t sure I could keep going. They made me throw my hair back and laugh, in classrooms, the dining hall, walking home from the Yard. Joy would fill me up and bubble out, overflowing with loud exclamations. Harvard became my home in those moments, when happiness overtook the lows and I can’t say I’d ever exchange my memories of this place for another University or life.
R: Here are my joys, the moments and rituals and objects that have saved me. In Sanders Theater, freshman year, week after week, hearing Toni Morrison deliver a series of lectures. Running into Junot Díaz at one of the lectures and becoming a bumbling mess. Listening to Toni Morrison command the audience with her poetic oration, timing, and spitfire wit. Experiencing a living legend and knowing I was witnessing history in progress. Being reminded of the magic of words, and their ability to cut through the hatred, injustice, and absurdity of the world.
Z: Every year here has challenged me in a way that is indescribable. But I found the will to keep going, to keep fighting, because of the beauty in my life. Contentment found me on my first Housing Day. It filled me up as I stood in a dorm room surrounded by my closest friends, with a pounding heart wondering where my home would be for the next three years. Then it came to me again when I was welcomed to the Mather House family by putting my arms around my fellow Matherites and singing “Our House, Mather House, in the middle of the street.” Laughter found me then, too.
R: Six mile runs, sometimes through a cold drizzle, from my dorm room to Topacio, my favorite Salvadoran restaurant in East Boston. One dollar pupusas on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The sound of Spanish in the air, people that looked like my aunts and uncles, and a reminder that the overwhelming whiteness of Harvard is not the complete picture. East Boston, and its gentle acceptance of my visits, has reminded me of my worth.
Z: I spent so much of my time when I arrived here doubting if I was good enough to contribute in classrooms. I didn’t feel like I could speak up. I didn’t know all the words that people were using, couldn’t understand the references they were making, and felt as out-of-place as one could feel. Happiness came to me in the moment when I found my voice. It warmed me when, after years of struggling, I called out a professor in class my sophomore fall for misrepresenting data on immigrants. It stayed with me every day, as I reminded myself that I was good enough, I was worthy, and my words did matter.
R: All the others joys that this page simply can’t hold: margaritas at Border Cafe, Thanksgivings in Branford, Conn., a moment of clarity when writing my thesis, a canceled class on a cloudy day, a fruitful discussion in seminar, learning the lyrics to “Come On Eileen,” Editorial Board meetings at The Crimson three times a week, being invited to appear on Tucker Carlson’s show and then turning down the offer, reggaeton blasting, and every single obnoxious laugh.
Z: I found myself in the little moments and memories that over time have lost their detail, but have never lost the feelings of warmth that they’ve given me. Endless laughter — that’s what I can remember — and if I could do it all over again? I would do it all the same, just for those moments of happiness and joy.
R + Z: This column. This column and its readers. Every comment, every disagreement, every engagement with the words we have written. The countless hours spent sitting with each other, discussing our column and other unrelated chisme. Finding a voice through this column. Knowing ourselves and each other, intimately. Fighting the fear. Writing it down.
Our time at Harvard has been complicated, but no Harvard experience is fully devoid of joy. Make time for joy, look for it outside of the University when needed, and don’t you ever forget that you deserve to live a full, mostly positive life during your short time here.

​​​​​​
Legal experts and criminal justice reform advocates gathered in Tsai Auditorium to discuss mitigating wrongful convictions in the United States criminal justice system Monday evening.
The event, entitled “Fighting Wrongful Convictions in the Age of Mass Incarceration,” featured four panelists and centered on the experiences of Lorenzo Johnson, an activist who has personal experience with the issue of wrongful conviction. The panel was co-sponsored by seven organizations including the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Advocacy, the Committee on Degrees on History and Literature, and the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice.
Johnson opened the event by sharing the story of his incarceration for being an alleged accomplice in a 1995 murder in Harrisburg, Penn. In 2012, the Third Circuit Federal Court of Appeals granted him release from his life-without-parole sentence after ruling there was legally insufficient evidence for his conviction. Four months later, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reinstated his conviction, sending him back to prison. In July 2017, he agreed to a plea deal and was released from prison.
After resuming his sentence, Johnson led a nationwide media campaign to educate the public about his experiences with the support of the Pennsylvania Innocence Project, a non-profit organization that works to correct wrongful convictions.
During the event, Johnson shared moments when he said prosecutors and the police asked him to provide false statements and forced his alibi witnesses to manufacture or change their statements.
“A lot of people got the misconception that the [criminal justice] system is broken,” Johnson said. “The system was never fixed. The system was never designed to be fair.”
Throughout the event, other panelists discussed aspects of the criminal justice system that can enable wrongful convictions.
Aditi Goel, a clinical instructor at Harvard Law School’s Criminal Justice Institute, spoke about “draconian” mandatory minimum sentences, lack of funding for public defenders, and the lengthy amount of time people wait for trial, which can incentivize plea deals.
Rahsaan D. Hall, director of the Racial Justice Program at the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts and a former prosecutor, condemned the “nature and culture” of prosecution itself.
“It is the cultural inertia of white supremacy that uplifts these ideas and practices,” Hall said. “And it funnels through every aspect so that even a black man like myself, as a prosecutor, is an instrument of that white supremacy.”
Radha Natarajan, executive director of the New England Innocence Project, spoke about the preponderance of minor marijuana or driving offenses in criminal convictions as well as prejudice against African American men.
“What is a wrongful conviction? That has to be broader than what people traditionally think of,” Natarajan said. “It has to be about who is brought into the system to begin with.”
Beyond “band-aid” solutions to wrongful convictions, panelists suggested broader solutions and reforms, including using social media as an educational tool and pushing for legislation.
“You can’t just fight the case inside the courtroom,” Johnson said. “You have to fight it outside the courtroom too.”
Joseph R. Feffer ’21, an event attendee and HOPE organizer, said he appreciated the opportunity to learn more about ways individuals can prevent wrongful convictions.
“I think a lot of times people come to panels like these and walk away and go back to our Harvard lives,” Feffer said. “But the things said about going to jury duty, making sure you’re watching court, voting in District Attorney elections, are very easy actions that we all can do. That’s what what I’m going to take away the most from this.”

Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale submitted a budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 to the City Council Monday, with the largest allocations directed toward education and public safety.
Councilors received the budget on Monday prior to the general meeting. This year's proposals constitute a 5.7 percent increase from fiscal year 2019. It includes more than $200 million earmarked for education, up from $191 million in 2019, and $146 million for public safety, up from $139 million the previous year.
The budget totals more than $678 million in appropriations and amounts to one of the largest budget increases Cambridge has ever seen, according to DePasquale.
“I just want to start off by saying how pleased I am to really present a budget, I feel, has really addressed the fact that we have listened to the City Council and to the public,” he said.
DePasquale elaborated on the increased education funding, citing initiatives that provide free breakfast to all elementary and upper schools in Cambridge and MBTA passes for low-income high school students who qualify. He described the city’s commitment to education as “second to none.”
Also included in the budget proposal is $20 million to support the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust. This follows recent efforts by the City Council to reform zoning laws to incentivize developers to build affordable housing units. Though DePasquale touted the budget’s success in addressing many of the councilors' recommendations, he acknowledged that it is not perfect — especially concerning affordable housing.
“We have heard from the council, we've heard from the residents that we need more affordable housing, and the city has tried to meet the demand,” he said. “But obviously we need to do more.”
Several councilors voiced their gratitude to the City Manager’s Office. Councilor E. Denise Simmons, who chairs the Council’s Finance Committee, praised the budget and several individuals for their role in compiling and writing the proposal.
“What's great about the budget is it tells the story of Cambridge and in a very succinct way not only from the financial aspect, but just for the service aspect,” she said.
Mayor Marc C. McGovern also commended the City Manager’s Office for its work, and said he believes the city budget accurately reflects the city’s values. He cited Cambridge’s investment in immigrant support, environmentalism, urban forestry, homelessness prevention, education, and affordable housing.
“That doesn't happen by accident,” he said. “And doesn't happen easily.”
In a unanimous vote, the council voted to refer the budget proposal to the Finance Committee for consideration. The Finance Committee hearing to discuss the proposal will convene on May 1, when individual departments will present their budget breakdowns for fiscal year 2020.
McGovern also addressed the expectations of Cambridge residents, saying that while the budget cannot address every city issue, it comes “pretty darn close.”
“It's okay to criticize us when there are things to criticize. I think that's fair,” he said. “But it's also okay to applaud when there are things to applaud. And this budget is worth applause.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot of behaviors that once seemed generally acceptable have been reexamined in recent years. We no longer, for example, accept the excuse that “boys will be boys.” But college students, supposedly, should be allowed to be college students who drink and party even until they end up in hospitals or handcuffs. This is an inevitability that should be accepted, not firmly resisted or even gently questioned.
This view has been made clear in the aftermath of a well-publicized incident following last year’s Yardfest on April 13, when a College student — naked and likely under the influence of narcotics — was arrested by Cambridge police officers just off-campus. The incident sparked debate around many issues, including police brutality, a topic that deserves to be addressed comprehensively elsewhere. Here I will focus on how the involvement of the Cambridge Police Department, rather than just Harvard University Health Services or the Harvard University Police Department, demonstrated that something in the University’s management of students’ drug and alcohol usage had failed. During last year’s Yardfest, a day known for high levels of student intoxication, Harvard did not handle everything thrown its way.
The natural next step is to look for solutions. The main line of student-proposed solutions, however, has looked outward. Buy an ambulance. Hire more health services workers. Reform the police. These might indeed help students, but they’re fundamentally missing the mark. Why should the solutions come from elsewhere when the problem is coming from within — from the students themselves?
No, these student-proposed solutions are egregiously entitled. They all require more people (and more money) to clean up our messes. They all imply the lesson from a mishap is that these other people need to shape up.
The police, in particular, are singled out as the student body’s favorite targets. HUPD’s duty is to protect us. But come on — their job should not be to attend to blacked-out undergraduates, and we should try to make their lives easier. (The reason why HUPD could not respond to calls regarding the arrested student on the night of Yardfest, as protesters argued they should have, was that they were overwhelmed by the number of student emergencies already reported.) HUPD is not perfect, but we expect a level of perfection from them that we do not ask of ourselves — not even close.
Why do students support these external solutions rather than inward ones? Because they argue that college partying is inevitable. Thus, all Harvard can really do is be there to make the process safer.
Now, some level of enabling is desirable. Let the University continue to turn a blind eye towards the harmless behavior. I’m libertarian enough to believe that you should do what you want — as long as you can take care of it yourself. It’s college. And I believe in second chances enough to support some sort of amnesty policy.
But too much enabling emboldens the receiving party to demand more and more. In the aftermath of the April 13 incident, students have for the most part refused to accept responsibility. Instead, at any hint that they are part of the problem, they cry foul.
In his November 2018 email to the community about the review committee’s report on the April 13 incident, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote he was “troubled” by the upward trend in student intoxication at Yardfest. Yardfest health incidents were over five times higher than the previous year’s and overloaded two nearby emergency rooms. I took Bacow’s words as a reasonable — yet far from harsh — reminder that, if nothing else, students should be mindful that their actions can deplete valuable resources that are inherently finite.
But this Editorial Board called even Bacow’s small rebuke “missing the mark.” Any mention of students’ wayward behavior was supposedly a distraction from the underlying incident — though such behavior was the very catalyst.
Students also feel like they should be entitled to the broadest possible amnesty policy. This Editorial Board, for example, pushed back when Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana recently raised the prospect of reconsidering the amnesty policy. The Board argued that a stricter policy will be harmful by only reducing the number of people who seek help, not how much they use. It calls on the College to “prioritize student safety.”
Again, as if prioritizing student safety is something only third parties can do. The questions remain: Why should students deserve amnesty at all if they know exactly what they’re getting themselves into? Or, less harshly, why shouldn’t Harvard restrict the amnesty policy and force students to prioritize their well-being, or at the very least their good standing in college?
Something is seriously wrong when we can’t even acknowledge that we have a problem — of which overflowing hospital rooms or arrests are just symptoms. Something is seriously wrong when students feel entitled enough to demand that the University must indulge them, instead of reasonably curtailing their lifestyle choices. Because the kinds of behavior in question aren’t inevitabilities; they are choices. And in adulthood — a title we love to claim for ourselves in seemingly any other situation — we shouldn’t be entitled to anything except to face the consequences of our choices.

​​​​​​
At the start of a revitalized “Heat Week” campaign, students, faculty, and alumni gathered to call on University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard administrators to divest their endowment holdings in the fossil fuel industry at a press conference at the Charles Hotel Monday.
Heat Week began as a week-long protest organized by Divest Harvard — a fossil fuel divestment advocacy group — in April 2015. Hundreds of students and several faculty members blockaded Mass. Hall for a week, occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters for two days, and blockaded University Hall multiple times.
This year, members of Divest Harvard planned a week of public actions, civil disobedience trainings, and panels about divestment activism. Heat Week will culminate in a rally entitled “Flood Harvard” in Harvard Yard on Friday.
The group organized the press conference to coincide with Earth Day, and invited high-profile alumni, faculty, and environmental advocates to join their call for fossil fuel divestment.
Gina McCarthy, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator and director of C-CHANGE at the Harvard School of Public Health, kicked off the hour-long conference by sharply criticizing Harvard’s investments in fossil fuels.
“It is time for Harvard and other Ivy League schools to divest,” McCarthy said. “They know better. Get over it. Move forward.”
McCarthy also urged the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — to align their investments with the ongoing climate change research produced by Harvard scientists.
“It’s time for Harvard Corporation’s investment policies to match the University’s commitment to science, to its scientists, to our shared values, our views of the students, the faculty, the alumni to put Harvard's money where it belongs — in the future and not in the past, in clean energy and not fossil fuels,” McCarthy said.
Amidst heightening divestment activism in recent months, Bacow has maintained that the University should engage with fossil fuel companies through its shareholding and scholarship to reduce the effects of climate change instead of divesting from them. Bacow also continues to promote long-standing University president rhetoric that the endowment should not be used as a mechanism for social change.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain reiterated this position.
"The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain wrote.
Swain also wrote Harvard maintains a Climate Change Solutions Fund, a University initiative that gives grants for research projects that offer creative solutions to climate change.
“As President Larry Bacow has said, the University agrees with the urgent need to tackle climate change and has valued the opportunity to discuss the issues with members of the community,” Swain wrote.
Bacow’s messages come as Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign have ramped up their protests and petitions for divestment from fossil fuels and companies tied to the prison industry.
Earlier this month, protestors from both groups interrupted an event at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum where Bacow was slated to speak, forcing the talk to continue after moving to a nearby classroom. Bacow also participated in an hour-long forum about fossil fuel divestment.
At the press conference, Harvard alumni and faculty joined in students’ demands for divestment. English professor James T. Engell argued the need for fossil fuel divestment is growing rapidly.
“An endowment may serve the present, but its deeper purpose has always been to underwrite future generations,” Engell said. “It's been more than five years since Harvard has announced it would not divest. We’ve only a couple more sets of five years and then the game becomes pretty dire.”
Former United States Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61, who helped organize the press conference, said in an interview following the press conference that the University could not maintain their position against divestment forever.
“They cannot sustain their position,” Wirth said. “I mean, it's intellectually unsustainable; it's economically unsustainable; it's morally unsustainable.”
“They've got to really be given the room to move away from it, and it's going to take time, but they will change,” he added. “We're not going away.”

Boston public radio station WBUR hosted a panel discussion about strategies for combating climate change Monday evening at CitySpace in collaboration with Harvard Business School and the Boston University School of Business.
The panel — entitled “Climate Politics and Business” — marked the third event in a five-part series called “Stepping Up: Business in the Era of Climate Change.” The event featured business executives who spoke about economic and policy reforms to reduce carbon emissions, drawing a crowd of roughly 100 people on Earth Day.
The panelists discussed several approaches to tackling climate change through government action. William C. Eacho, the co-founder of a lobbying organization called Partnership for Responsible Growth, said he favored “free market solutions” such as a carbon tax over a “regulatory approach.”
“You’re going to have a hard time agreeing at a federal level on a bipartisan answer that approaches it from the regulatory approach,” Eacho said. “You have a far better chance at a bipartisan solution if you’re talking about market solutions.”
Mindy S. Lubber — the CEO and president of Ceres, a non-profit that advises companies on adopting sustainable practices — said fiscal policy needs to incorporate incentives for businesses to reduce their negative environmental impacts.
Lubber said leaders of companies must also understand “that [they are] stewards of the future as well as stewards of [their] quarterly balance sheet.”
Auden Schendler, the vice president of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Company, said public support for combating climate change, however, is insufficient.
“We really do need a revolution,” Schendler said. “Ultimately, this is a problem of democracy. It’s a failure of democracy in America where people feel disempowered. They feel it doesn’t matter. They are deeply cynical. They feel let down.”
Lubber agreed that motivating people to pay attention to the environment is difficult, characterizing climate change as a “psychological challenge.” She said finding solutions to stem climate change is “scientifically and technologically possible.”
“Will of humanity is really what’s on the line,” Lubber added.
Attendee Dianne M. Brown said the event made her think about the lack of public engagement surrounding climate change.
“We need to figure out how to get voters and the public engaged in these issues across the country because if we do, the solution will come far more quickly,” she said.
The WBUR series on the intersection of climate change and business solutions is the brainchild of Business School professor Michael W. Toffel, who said he pitched the idea to the station in June. Toffel said the series aims to “shine a light on” policy solutions that business can support to stem harmful environmental impacts.
“We want to amplify in the Boston community how firms are being impacted by climate change and how firms are affecting climate change,” he said.
WBUR’s Director of Community Engagement Amy E. Macdonald said one of the station’s goals is to attract more than just business-minded people to this discussion.
“It’s not only people in the business industry, but I think it’s more just your regular lay person in Boston, who cares about these issues,” Macdonald said.
There are two events remaining in the series: “The Road Map of the Future: Transportation” and “Energy Transition.” The events will take place at CitySpace on May 7 and June 4, respectively.

The Committee on Student Life granted the Seneca — a former all-female social organization that went co-ed in August 2016 in response to Harvard College’s social group sanctions — provisional recognition as an Independent Student Organization in fall 2018, a change from its former status as a Recognized Social Organization.
RSOs are former single-gender organizations that are “primarily social” in purpose and “do not discriminate on the basis of gender,” and are therefore not subject to the penalties on single-gender groups, according to the Dean of Students Office website. Harvard’s sanctions policy — announced in May 2016 and first applied to the Class of 2021 — prohibits members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from obtaining College endorsement for high-profile fellowships like the Rhodes and from serving in leadership positions in varsity sports teams and some extracurricular clubs.
ISOs are groups of undergraduates “who unite to promote or celebrate a common interest or talent in ways that are separate from formal course study,” according to the DSO Resource Guide for Student Organizations. More than 400 extracurricular organizations on campus — ranging from a cappella groups to cultural affinity clubs — are currently classified as ISOs.
The Seneca chose to apply for ISO status through the Undergraduate Council, according to College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman. He confirmed the UC granted the group “provisional” recognition in fall 2018 and will review its eligibility for full recognition in spring 2020.
The UC and former Office of Student Life — now known as the DSO — first announced the new review process for prospective student organizations in spring 2017. Organizations seeking recognition first apply for provisional status with the UC in the fall. After a one-year trial period, the UC reviews them again for full recognition.
Seneca Co-Presidents Keziah Clarke ’20 and Hadley N. DeBello ’20 wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the Seneca’s “passion for womxn’s advocacy” made it more suitable to be classified as an ISO than as an RSO.
“We believed that ISO status was more representative of our organization’s advocacy-based mission than the RSO status originally granted to us by the College,” Clarke and DeBello wrote.
They added that the Seneca organizes professional workshops, hosts an annual Women’s Faculty Reception, and participates in Women’s Week in the spring.
“While we take pride in our strong community and enjoy participating in and hosting our own safe, open, and inclusive social events, The Seneca’s mission is not purely social in nature,” they wrote. “We are also focused on pursuing initiatives that create better environments and opportunities for womxn.”
While several historically single-sex groups chose to adopt co-ed membership policies and become RSOs, some Greek groups and final clubs continue to fight the College’s sanctions. In December 2018, national groups affiliated with sororities and fraternities — along with three anonymous College students — sued Harvard in federal and state court, contending that the sanctions illegally constitute sex-based discrimination.
On Friday, Harvard defended its motions to dismiss the twin suits, marking the last round of legal filings before state and federal judges decide whether to proceed with the cases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s difficult to figure out what, exactly, is the most unsettling part of “The Ash Family,” Molly E. Dektar ’12’s debut novel. Perhaps it’s the way Dice, the de facto leader and patriarch of the Ash family, lives above and enforces the rules, or the sense of pervasive instability that haunts Berie’s, also known as Harmony, every action from the moment she arrives in the family’s midst. These two features of the novel undoubtedly contribute to a sense of unease, but more insidious is Berie’s profound inner uncertainty, leaving her at the whims of the men she’s fallen (read: tumbled) in love with. These men tend to detect her weakness and exploit it. Dektar’s novel is simultaneously about finding acceptance within a cult and finding acceptance from within. This makes her desperate desire to be loved all the more heart-wrenching to watch. The novel’s strength lies in its ability to elicit a sense of panic: Berie’s desperation to define her “definite self” is both pitiful and terrifyingly relatable.
The “definite self,” as members of the family call it, does not exist. In Dice’s words, a person is nothing more than a shifting mass of memories and emotions, none of which can actually be cobbled together to create an identity. This idea lies at the heart of the Ash family’s near-transcendent philosophy and approach to living: Everything, including one’s body, clothes, and private space, is communal. The outside world is fake. If it sounds cultish, it is, yet when Berie runs away from college and finds Bay, a member of the Ash family, she falls in love with him and this philosophy in the hopes that it will save her from getting lost.
At times it’s easy to forget that Berie is only 19 years old. She often sounds much older and much more detached, but also much younger considering naïveté and her at-times simplistic take on relationships. Yet even that view of her changes as the novel progresses, because the questions she asks herself and the thoughts that cause her pain are not easy things to live with. Early on, she muses about her ex-boyfriend, thinking, “Isaac was good at freeing me to feel new disdain or new love; that was why I liked him so much,” which is not so much a statement on how he makes her more interesting but rather how he shapes her interests.
Concerning Bay, she hopes that “there was something to me that he liked, something he liked beyond my willingness.” Dektar effectively frames Berie’s insecurities, perfectly encapsulated in the sentence “since I never had an idea what I was supposed to say,” as a representation of a larger preoccupation: “The Ash Family” is a story of having pleased others one’s entire life at the expense of pleasing oneself — to the extent of not knowing oneself. Even her new name, Harmony, hints at her desire to be liked and accepted at the detriment of the self. (Food for thought: Queen, Berie’s friend in the family, is forced to herbally abort the baby she wants to keep — perhaps the context of a cult is part of a larger commentary on the grooming of women to please others?)
Dektar does a lot in 352 pages, not least of which is her scenic prose. One phrase of note, “carmine red like a quince flower” mixes a few too many images together to create an picture, but when read aloud flow well enough to forgive her. Dektar is good with color: “[the] afternoon was glaring gold, the mountains violet” stands out, as does describing something as “map blue.”
Part of the novel’s success is the reader’s own uncertainty about what is truth and what is not, and that, perhaps, is the point. In the context of belonging and feeling loved, the two often blur, or one can look like the other. The pitiful tragedy of the Ash family is that its members confuse the “definite self” with having a self without the qualifying adjective. In reality, just because an individual is made up of memories pieced together — “‘We’re all just shifting groups of memory and personality, but you can’t hammer down a self in all of that’”— does not mean they are diminished. Rather, it’s natural for the self to be constantly in flux: Dektar’s characters reject this concept out of fear of what that means. As Berie’s inner turmoil suggests, to not know where one stands, or belongs, is confusing at best and crippling at worst. It is difficult to confront the notion that an identity can change in different contexts, especially in an age when identity seems to beg for definition.
“The Ash Family” is, most simply, about getting lost while surrounded by others, but it’s also about misunderstanding how love is expressed, struggling to understand how to love others, and the journey towards figuring out where one’s soul belongs. Not even Berie knows where stands at the very end, but maybe that’s the point. All that’s clear is that she’s taken at least one step forward.

Freshman thrower Sam Welsh is no stranger to success. Coming into his collegiate career with a national title and a state record in the discus and a personal record of 59-1 in the shot put, Welsh was already one of the most decorated throwers in the country. Harvard had not boasted a thrower with this much ceiling since Nick Sweeney, an Irishman who made four straight Olympics in the discus beginning in 1992.
His success has not waned in college, competing against the best throwers in the Ancient Eight. He already has the best mark in the league in the discus and has placed first in three different meets. The most surprising thing about Welsh’s success? He had never thrown in a competition until his junior year of high school.
“I began throwing discus after my sophomore year in high school,” Welsh said. “At the time, I had decided that I no longer wanted to pursue a career in baseball or basketball so I was looking for something else to do. I went to a track practice to try my hand at throwing, not knowing anything about the sport. I launched the discus as far as I could and I was told that it would be a new school record if I could do it in a meet.”
Welsh saw that he had an uncanny talent for throwing and was motivated to try to excel at a sport he had never tried before. Had the track coach not realized Welsh’s abilities, he would not have discovered a passion that has been such as significant part of his life for the past three years.
“The following summer consisted of many hours throwing in a dirt field and watching YouTube videos to learn technique” Welsh said. “In my first meet of junior year, I threw 183’ 9” which broke that school record by over 70 feet. I eventually increased my mark to 212’ 0” which broke the all-time New England record and I won the National Championship in my senior year.”
Welsh’s accomplishments in such a short period of time is unprecedented. One can only imagine how unbreakable his records would be had he started throwing earlier. As he started participating in more competitive meets, Welsh’s pre-meet routines matured to give him the most composure and poise before he had to throw.
“Before a big meet, I will have one practice the day before, simulating the meet as much as possible,” Welsh said. “Visualization is also very important because it allows me to ‘feel’ a lot of good throws without burning myself out. My best meets have been when I have felt really relaxed, so going into each meet I just try to have fun with it and perform the best that I am capable of.”
One of the keys to his success has been isolating his performance from everyone else’s. Rather than focusing on how his competitors are throwing, he concentrates on what he can control and his process. His mental progression is why he was able to develop from an elite thrower to the best in the country.
After having a set of stellar throws his senior year, all over 180 feet, he broke through with a mark of 202-4 in the discus at the Concord Relays his senior year. From there, he won New Balance Nationals and set the New England record in the discus with a mark of 212-0.
Once his collegiate career started, he continued his success with six different top three finishes during the indoor season. At the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, he placed seventh, an impressive finish, but not as well as he hoped. He had a mark of 52-10.5, which was well below his personal best of 59-1. To have a better result at Ivy Heps this outdoor season, he changed his training regime.
“In the indoor season, I spent a lot of time in the weight room gaining as much strength as possible,” Welsh said. “As the outdoor season progresses, I have been focusing more on technique and explosiveness. When training for an event such as discus, it is crucial to gain as much strength as possible in the offseason before turning to a focus on explosive movements during competition season. As nationals approaches, I will be going lighter in the weight room but moving faster with my exercises and through the circle.”
Concentrating on his technique and explosiveness has paid off for the Lunenburg, Mass., native. He demonstrated his prowess against Ivy League rival Yale by winning the Harvard/Yale dual meet and also competed against the best in the nation at the Texas Relays.
“It was amazing to throw against the best in the country as a freshman,” Welsh said. It’s not every day that I feel small compared to those around me but those guys were huge... The competition gave me experience throwing at a national caliber meet, which will help me for the rest of the season. I look forward to facing them again in future competitions and next time, I’ll be ready to give them a good fight.”
With over a month of the season having passed, Welsh is now gearing up for the biggest meets of the season such as Ivy Heps, NCAAs, and USA Nationals.
“My goal now is to lock in new changes to my form and ramp up my explosiveness,” Welsh said. “I also want perform as well as I can at NCAAs and hopefully qualify for USA Nationals.”
When Welsh isn’t training or doing his work, he is working on his dunk reels. The freshman thrower has an impressive array of dunks that has been noticed by multiple Instagram pages such as Dunkademics and TeamFlightBrothers.
“I’ve always loved the sport of basketball,” Welsh said. “One of my dreams was to dunk like the players I would watch on TV so I began my jump training at the age of 12. I got my first dunk by age 14 and it took off from there. I love dunking in my free time and I am always trying to get better. In addition to my Olympic goals, I hope to be a professional dunker and test the limits of my jumping ability.”
As the outdoor season concludes, be on the lookout for more record-breaking performances by Welsh and more impressive highlight dunks.

Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams both went 1-1 over the weekend, with both programs picking up wins versus Cornell on Saturday before falling to Columbia on Sunday. While the men’s team remains in the hunt for the Ivy League title, needing a win in its final match in addition to a Columbia loss, the women’s loss to Columbia brought its season to a close.
WOMEN'S TENNIS
Harvard (17-7, 5-2 Ivy) opened its final weekend of Ivy League play with a strong showing at Cornell (6-16, 0-7), as it cruised to a 4-0 victory in Ithaca, N.Y. The win was the Crimson’s ninth in its last 10.
Senior captain Erica Oosterhout and junior Natasha Gonzalez opened the day with a strong doubles showing, picking up a quick win in a 6-2 victory. The win marked the pair’s team-best eleventh on the season. Sophomore Anna Li and freshman Annika Bassey rounded out doubles play with another 6-2 victory.
Gonzalez added a 6-1, 6-2 victory in singles play, bringing her to 14 singles wins for the season, which ties junior Jenna Friedel for the best on the team. Junior Irene Lu continued her hot streak, adding a 6-1, 7-5 win for her seventh straight singles victory.
Harvard then travelled to New York on Sunday to face No. 44 Columbia (15-4, 4-3) in its final regular season match of its 2018-2019 season. Columbia came out on top, 4-2, after a back and forth affair, which saw the Crimson pick up the doubles point before faltering in singles play.
“I'm really proud of what we accomplished over the weekend and over this season in general,” Oosterhout said. “Even though we didn't get the result we wanted in our Columbia match, everybody played really well, and everybody was fighting out there to the last second, and that's really all you can ask for.”
Oosterhout and Gonzalez added another victory to open doubles play, winning a 7-6(8) nailbiter. Freshman Rachel Lim and Friedel then secured the doubles point with a 7-5 victory. But as the teams moved into singles play, Harvard’s momentum began to fade, and it dropped its first three singles points.
A win from freshman Rachel Eason, along with close matches from Gonzales and Lu kept the Crimson in the match going into the final stretch. Ultimately, Harvard couldn’t pull out the win, ending its hopes of an Ivy League victory with a second-place finish.
“I think the team is in a good spot,” Oosterhout said. “There are only two seniors so most of the team will be coming back and they know the drill and the freshmen have the experience now. So I think things are looking up for next year, as long as everybody stays healthy and works hard, I think it’ll be great.”
MEN'S TENNIS
No. 38 Harvard (18-6, 5-1) got its final full weekend of Ivy League contests off to a strong start as it defeated Cornell 4-3 in a comeback victory. The win was the Crimson’s eighth in a row.
Freshmen duo Steven Sun and Harris Walker got the first win of the day for Harvard, cruising to a 6-1 victory. Freshman Brian Shi and sophomore Robert Wrzesinski then picked up the doubles point for the Crimson with a 6-4 win in the top doubles spot.
Shi and Walker continued their strong showing on the day, picking up 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 and 6-4, 2-6, 7-5 wins in the third and fourth slots, respectively. Shi’s win completed Harvard’s 4-3 comeback, after it dropped the first three matches in singles play.
“I thought it was a really strong performance from our guys, this past weekend,” co-captain Andy Zhou said. “We had a very good showing against Cornell and were able to come back from a bit of a deficit to win that match. And that put us in a really good position with a lot of positive momentum moving into Sunday's match against Columbia.”
Harvard’s final home match of the season came on Sunday, as they fell 4-1 against No. 16 Columbia (18-6, 5-1). The Crimson picked up the doubles point before falling to the Lions in singles play.
Sun and Walker picked up a 6-1 doubles to get the day started, the pair’s second win of the weekend. Shi and Wrzesinski’s subsequent 6-4 victory captured the doubles point for Harvard.
Singles play proved tougher for the Crimson, as Sun dropped his singles match, 7-5, 6-4, while Wrzesinski also fell early, 6-1, 6-1. Sophomore Lane Leschly’s and Walker’s ensuing losses ended Harvard’s chances, as they fell 6-2, 7-5 and 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, respectively.
“I'm glad to see that even though we weren't able to provide the result, objectively, we've been having a strong season as far as results go.” Zhou said. “I'm confident that with our experience, and with that under our belt, we still have a lot of great tennis to play, and the best is still ahead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination investigation into whether Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. sexually harassed and retaliated against a former female employee concluded in February by agreement of the parties, according to documents obtained by The Crimson.
The former employee filed a complaint with the MCAD — which enforces Massachusetts laws forbidding unlawful discrimination based on traits including gender, race, sexual orientation, and gender identity — against Fryer, Harvard, and Education Innovation Labs Chief of Staff Bradley M. Allan a year ago. She filed alleging sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation, according to the documents.
The MCAD closed its investigation after the complainant’s lawyer, Monica R. Shah, signed the withdrawal form on Feb. 4. On the form, Shah indicated that the complainant had reached a “satisfactory settlement” with Harvard, Fryer, and Allan.
Shah declined to comment for this story. George J. Leontire, Fryer’s lawyer, said the complaint was dismissed upon agreement of the parties, rather than settled.
Because the parties agreed to conclude the matter before the MCAD issued a report with findings, it is unclear whether the agency evaluated any of the conduct in the complaint. The Crimson obtained the complaint under the Massachusetts public records law. Because that law does not permit public disclosure of the accused party’s written response to the complaint, it is not known exactly what Fryer or other respondents may have said in rebuttal.
Leontire wrote in an email April 9 that Fryer denies all the allegations against him.
“He has denied them from the inception of this matter except to acknowledge he made off color jokes which he apologized for to anyone who took offense,” Leontire wrote.
Fryer wrote a letter in the New York Times in December apologizing to employees who felt “alienated, confused or offended by the environment” and denying that he sexually harassed or retaliated against employees.
The former employee’s “complaint narrative” attached to the MCAD filing alleged Fryer sexually harassed the complainant over a nearly three-year period while she worked at the EdLabs, the research group he founded. The complainant also wrote that she reported his behavior to Harvard human resources officers at least three times.
The complainant alleged Fryer spoke about sex in the office, joked about employees’ sex lives — including speculating about employees having sex with one another — and sent employees explicit text messages. She repeated her allegations in a separate Title IX complaint filed with Harvard. The Office for Dispute Resolution — which investigates formal Title IX complaints — substantiated six out of the 32 examples she provided of Fryer making sexual remarks, the Times reported in December.
The complainant also wrote in the MCAD filing that after she reported Fryer, he “made allegations of performance issues” against her and “tried to have her fired.” She repeated a similar claim in her Title IX complaint, but the Times reported that an ODR investigator could not substantiate the allegation.
The “hostile” environment at EdLabs eventually forced the complainant to leave her job, according to her account.
“The sexually hostile environment in the EdLabs office has caused [the complainant] substantial stress. It was eventually so toxic that she was compelled to go out on disability leave,” the complaint stated.
The Times reported that an ODR investigator found that Fryer’s “persistent and pervasive” conduct led to stress that later caused the complainant to take disability leave.
The complainant also alleged Allan participated in the sexually hostile climate Fryer allegedly fostered at EdLabs.
Allan declined to comment on the complaint.
Finally, the complainant alleged Faculty of Arts and Sciences Director of HR Programs and Operations Katharyn Santoro — to whom the employee went with concerns about Fryer — and another Harvard HR employee failed in their obligation to prevent Fryer and Allan from retaliating against her.
The complainant was one of at least four EdLabs employees to contact HR with concerns about EdLabs staff over a ten-year period, according to her MCAD allegations and two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the complaint.
The MCAD investigation was just one of five investigations that Fryer has faced over the past year. Harvard opened three Title IX inquiries into Fryer as well as an investigation into his finances and personal spending.
The Title IX complainants alleged Fryer engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct stretching back years and that he created a hostile environment for women at EdLabs. Fryer has repeatedly denied these allegations.
ODR issued findings last fall with regard to two of the three Title IX investigations into Fryer. The financial inquiry is still ongoing, and findings have not yet been issued.
Asked about the financial investigation, Fryer told the Times that he “hired a first-rate finance team to insure both transparency and full compliance with Harvard policy.”

Class of 2023, congrats! You’ve finally made it to the most chaotic and fun part of Harvard: Visitas. In between the thousand or so events, you’ll need to refuel to keep the your energy strong for the weekend. Luckily, Harvard University Dining Services has got your back. Annenberg is the freshman dining hall and is the fancy-looking building located right next to the Science Center. Most of you will eat there at some point during Visitas. Because nothing is ever simple at Harvard (not even meals), we’ve compiled a guide on how to do the Berg (that’s its nickname) the right way.
Have Your Swipe Card Ready
Holding up the line at the door while you dig your swipe card out of the Tartarean recesses of your bag is a surefire way to annoy everyone around you. Please pity the poor student just trying to zoom through the Berg to cram a HUDS paper cup with some pasta in between classes or meetings by keeping it moving! Mile-long lines are meant for Clover, not the Berg. Besides, freshmen are already feeling the ego boost of not being the youngest people on campus, so don’t feed into it by giving them something to complain about.
Don’t Block Traffic
After you’ve made it through the swipe station, Annenberg seems to stretch on into infinity in all directions. While it’s beautiful, don’t appreciate this fact in the middle of a walkway. There’s time to gush to all your new friends about how it looks just like the Great Hall from “Harry Potter” later. To keep things moving, it’s best if you put your bags down at a table first and then grab a tray. That’ll help you and your group avoid becoming a cloud of prefrosh holding trays in the middle of an aisle looking for enough empty seats. Also, if you’re trying to decide which of the nearly endless list of events to go to next, make sure to make a decision before you take your plates to the tray return instead of clustering in a walkway to talk about which event has the best free food.
Say Hi to John
Sure, everyone loves the John Harvard statue in the Yard. But the real John of Harvard is the one manning the swipe station at the Berg. Legend says that if you can get him to remember your name by the end of Visitas, you’re destined for greatness.
Embrace the Awkwardness
If you’re feeling stressed about the massiveness of the Berg and the crowds within it, try to keep in mind that Visitas is probably the lowest stakes period of meet-and-greets you’ll do at Harvard. Everyone is wearing those ridiculous name tags around their necks, has said the same variation of name-plus-hometown-plus-intended-concentration greeting too many times, and is far-removed from their comfortable social circle, so consider the ice long-past broken. Take a seat next to someone new! Best case, they become your wingman for raiding the free food and merch from events. Worst case, you have an awkward moment and see them maybe one more time in passing before the weekend’s up.
Take a Minute to Appreciate It
Visitas is a strange cross between a carnival, a college brochure, and a summer camp all crammed into a few short days. In between running from event to event and flexing about who’s logged the least hours of sleep over the weekend, take a minute to truly take in all of Annenberg’s beauty. Annenberg is something you won’t find anywhere else, and you’ll only enjoy a year of eating there at Harvard before you move up to an upperclassman house. So (as you respectfully refrain from blocking aisles), take a second to look around — it’s more than worth the time.
Prefrosh, we can’t wait to meet you, host you, and throw a million flyers for clubs at you! Hopefully, your first meal at the Berg goes smoothly. Who knows, you might even blend in with the current students (aside from the lanyard around your neck). See you soon!

MANCHESTER, N.H. — The 2020 Democratic Presidential Primary has already attracted more than 19 candidates, and Monday evening five of them are being featured in back-to-back town halls co-hosted by CNN and Harvard’s Institute of Politics. Starting at 7 p.m., CNN anchors Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, and Chris Cuomo will moderate a discussion between audience members and Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg '04. Each will answer questions from the audience for an hour. 
The town hall is youth-focused, with approximately 500 young voters in attendance; Harvard’s IOP rented four buses to transport 200 students from various Harvard schools about 50 miles north of campus to Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H. The youth vote is expected to be particularly critical in this presidential election, as an IOP poll released earlier today predicted that Millenial and Gen Z voters will comprise more than a third of voters in the 2020 election. 
Follow along with live updates from The Crimson below.
***
April 23, 2019: 12:00 a.m.:
Buttigieg, the final of the five presidential candidates who spoke at this joint town hall, fields the last questions of the night. Cooper asks Buttigieg if Trump should be impeached (one of the only questions that was asked of all five candidates this evening). He responds: “I think he’s made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment. But I’m going to leave it to House and Senate to figure that out.” The final question that Buttigieg addresses goes back to his age — how he sets himself apart as the youngest candidate. An appropriate finish to the night with 500 youth in the audience. Buttigieg says he hopes to get more young people involved in politics and to make politics more inclusive so young people don’t have to ask “does my voice really matter?”
April 22, 2019: 11:50 p.m.:
A student from the New England College in Vermont asks Buttigieg how he views countries that see homosexuality as a sin and a crime punishable by death. He replies by saying simply: “I think it’s wrong to harm or punish people because they are a part of the LGBTQ+ community.” Cooper follows up by asking how Buttigieg’s life would have been different if he had come out sooner (he came out four years ago, when he was 33 years old). Buttigieg quips back that if dating had been available to him when he was in his 20s, he wouldn’t have gotten nearly as much done.
April 22, 2019: 11:40 p.m.:
Cooper asks Buttigieg about his comparisons of Sanders to Trump in comments about voters who are stuck economically. Buttigieg clarifies, saying that Sanders and Trump are “stupendously different.” However, he does say that there was similar “anti-establishment energy.” Continuing the Sanders thread, Cooper asks whether Buttigieg supports felons being able to vote even while serving their prison sentence. Earlier in the evening, Sanders had said that he does believe that those felons -- including those who performed bombings at the Boston Marathon, for example -- should have the right to vote. Buttigieg emphatically says that they should not while incarcerated. He does believe that after the sentence has been served, felons’ right to vote should be “restored.”
April 22, 2019: 11:30 p.m.:
Cooper asks Buttigieg whether he would support Warren’s higher education proposal announced earlier today. Buttigieg says that he still wants to “do some math around it” but that, upon first look, he finds it “pretty appealing.” He noted, however, that he does not feel completely comfortable with students who come from higher income backgrounds participating in the proposal. “The theory of it makes a lot of sense,” Buttigieg concluded.
April 22, 2019: 11:20 p.m.:
A Harvard sophomore asks Buttigieg whether he has a comprehensive immigration plan. Buttigieg says that he thinks “the dreamer story reflects the story of true Americans.” He adds: “We can’t have comprehensive immigration reform that works unless it addresses the status of those 11 million undocumented people.” This response garners the applause of the audience, including the student who asked the question.
April 22, 2019: 11:12 p.m.:
Buttigieg is the last of the five Democratic presidential candidates in tonight’s town hall with Cooper returning to the stage to moderate the discussion. Before questions begin, Cooper notes that though Buttegieg served as the IOP president during undergraduate career at Harvard, Buttegieg had no contribution in hosting this evening’s event. Buttegieg answers a question about his age and the fact that he has the least government experience of all the candidates this evening. Buttegieg says he has more government experience than Trump, more executive experience than Pence, and more military experience than any president since George H.W. Bush.
April 22, 2019: 11:04 p.m.:
Harris’ final questions center around issues concerning minorities and women. An audience member asks what specific rights she would provide for BGLTQ people in the United States. She responds, saying that she has been an ally for BGLTQ rights throughout her entire life, would give BGLTQ Americans rights under the law, and that this is a “civil rights and human issue.” Harris takes a question from a Harvard sophomore who asks about her stance on if Americans should be able to vote at 16 years of age. Harris answers: “I’m really interested in having that conversation” before speaking about the value of American democracy. Next up is South Bend Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg ’04.
April 22, 2019: 10:54 p.m.:
After another commercial break, a Harvard sophomore asks Harris how her background as a person of black and Indian descent would serve her if elected, noting that he comes from the same mixed-race background as she does. Harris responds: “The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us… I know that to be true because I have been exposed to many cultures.”
April 22, 2019: 10:44 p.m.:
Lemon asks Harris if she supports financial reparations for descendants of slaves. She says: “I support we study them and see.” An audience member turns the conversation to the possibility of cyber warfare, to which Harris responds: “This will be a war without blood, but we are not prepared, but we must be.” Harris — the former attorney general of California — answered questions about background in criminal justice by defending her stance on child truancy. Another audience member asks if Harris agrees with Sanders' earlier statement that even "terrible people" should be able to vote. Harris says: "I think we should have that conversation."
April 22, 2019: 10:35 p.m.:
An audience member asks Harris why she supports the Green New Deal, saying that it “has no chance of passing through Congress.” Harris responds by affirming her support for the proposed program: “It puts timelines in effect. The clock is ticking on this issue.” After a brief commercial break, a Harvard freshman asks Harris about her stance on reparations for descendants of slaves. In her question, the student references a recent vote by undergraduates at Georgetown University in favor of issuing reparations to descendants of the slaves who built the school's campus. Harris responded that to ignore these issues would be to overlook “facts of history.”
April 22, 2019: 10:22 p.m.:
Harris fields a question about her view on the cost of higher education and student loans — a recurring topic tonight in light of Warren’s higher education proposal for free public college announced earlier today. Harris says that it is “absolutely unconscionable” that there are students in America who are in “absolute fear” about student loan debt. When asked whether she supports Warren’s plan, however, Harris doesn’t answer directly. She says she supports “any attempt” to lower student-debt.
April 22, 2019: 10:10 p.m.:
Harris enters the theater to applause from an audience of the crowd of about 500 audience members with CNN’s Don Lemon as the moderator. The topic of impeachment arises again, as an audience member asks whether Congress should pursue the impeachment of Trump. Harris answers in the affirmative: “It is very clear that there is a lot of good evidence point to obstruction and obstruction of justice. Simply, I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment.”
April 22, 2019: 10:03 p.m.:
Sanders answers his final question of the night from a Harvard senior, who asks whether he thinks that his age will hinder his ability to gain the support of young voters. Sanders, 77, would be the oldest U.S. president if elected. Sanders replies by saying he is best suited to address the issues young people will face in the future, citing financial burdens. He says: “My campaign speaks to the idealism of young people who understand that we are not where we should be.” Next up is Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)
April 22, 2019: 9:55 p.m.:
Cuomo asks Sanders about Warren’s higher education proposal announced earlier today. Sanders says though he has not yet studied her plan, he and Warren “end up agreeing on a lot of issues.”
April 22, 2019: 9:49 p.m.:
A Harvard junior shifts the conversation to foreign policy, asking Sanders how he will maintain the relationship between the U.S. and Israel. Sanders says that he is “not anti-Israel” and that he thinks Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “treating Palestinian people extremely unfairly.” The following question circles back to the topic of criminal justice; Sanders says that that the United States’ incarcerated population is disproportionately Latinx and African American. Sanders adds that he wants to invest the $80 billion a year used for criminal justice in education and jobs for young people instead.
April 22, 2019: 9:38 p.m.:
Trump impeachment comes up for the third time this evening. Sanders says that he intends for Trump to not be re-elected, but that he is worried about conversations related to Trump impeachment and the Mueller report occupying valuable space that could otherwise be directed toward climate change, sexism, and racism. He says that this rhetoric works in Trump’s favor. Sanders does say he wants to see another House investigation, despite the fact that two investigations have already occurred.
April 22, 2019: 9:20 p.m.:
An audience member asks Sanders if his status as a millionaire undermines his authority to criticize “millionaires and billionaires.” Sanders says: “I plead guilty to have written a book that was an international bestseller,” referencing his book “Our Revolution” — a New York Times bestselling book in 2016. Sanders adds that he suspects his salary will drop in the future and that money will not influence his politics.
April 22, 2019: 9:10 p.m.:
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) takes the stage with CNN’s Cuomo as the moderator for the third session. Sanders fields the first question, which addresses his view on health care and eliminating private insurance companies: “Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege.”
April 22, 2019: 9 p.m.:
Warren spends the last ten minutes of her town hall segment addressing the issue of climate change and her philosophical approach to the presidency. She says that she is a strong supporter of the Green New Deal, a progressive proposal that includes broad goals for tackling climate change. She avoids directly comparing her philosophical approach to Obama’s but does state that she will “always be grateful” to him for his service.
April 22, 2019: 8:46 p.m.:
A Harvard sophomore asks Warren about Social Security reform. Warren first delivers a brief history of social security, and then says that there is not enough political will to make the necessary adjustments to fix the system. Warren says, however, that she is willing to take on the fight.
April 22, 2019: 8:36 p.m.:
Now, it is Warren's turn to be asked about impeachment proceedings. Warren says there is “no political inconvenience clause to the U.S. Constitution.” She attacks Trump’s presidency, saying that a “hostile foreign government” helped him get elected and that Trump has repeatedly tried to obstruct investigations into those claims.
April 22, 2019: 8:24 p.m.:
An audience member asks Warren how they can know that she will back legislation that keeps law enforcement safe. Warren responds by speaking to what she identifies as larger issues of racism within the criminal justice system. She then moves quickly into addressing gun safety: “One of the main ways we could help make our police safer it to get serious about gun safety in this country.”
April 22, 2019: 8:10 p.m.:
Warren's first question addresses her higher education proposal announced earlier today. Warren provides details of her plan, and quickly responds to Cooper’s follow-up question of how to pay for it: a wealth tax of two cents per dollar for incomes over $50 million dollars.
April 22, 2019: 8 p.m.:
Klobuchar’s hour is up. Next up is Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who announced earlier today that she would eliminate student loan debt for tens of millions of Americans and make all public college tuition free. Student loans have already been a topic of conversation this evening, with one of the first questions Klobuchar was asked centering on student debt. Anderson Cooper is now moderating.
April 22, 2019, 7:57 p.m.:
A Harvard Kennedy School student who served in Afghanistan asks how Klobuchar would address the epidemic of deaths by suicide among U.S. military veterans. Klobuchar says that she would make sure that the U.S. allocates the necessary resources to support veteran mental health, and that mental illness is as equally as important to treat as physical illness. She also references her work on the The Mental Health Parity bill.
April 22, 2019, 7:47 p.m.:
Klobuchar discusses what she calls Betsy D. DeVos’s failures as U.S. Secretary of Education. Klobuchar gives the Trump administration an F grade on how it has addressed questions of students with disabilities in higher education. She subsequently fields a question from a Harvard senior who grew up on a wolf sanctuary, who asks how she plans to include rural communities in the discussion about climate change. She says that she would get the U.S. back into international climate change agreements on the first day of her administration; bring back the Obama administration’s clean power regulations and gas mileage standards; and propose legislation for green buildings.
April 22, 2019, 7:30 p.m.:
Klobuchar addresses President Donald Trump, who made fun of her and criticized her stance on climate change when she first announced her candidacy during a blizzard in Minnesota. Klobuchar said that Democratic candidates need to have a sense of humor, and she joked that she would have liked to see President Trump try to deliver a speech in a snowstorm with his hair.
April 22, 2019, 7 p.m.:
Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) opens the night with CNN’s Chris Cuomo moderating. Two Harvard undergrads immediately question Klobuchar about whether the House should move forward with impeachment proceedings of current President Trump and about crime policies that disproportionately affect people of color. Klobuchar responds by saying that as a senator, she does not have the ability to initiate the proceedings.

Faust and Goldman Sachs
The idea of “selling out” in college is well known at Harvard. In case you’re confused, it usually refers to when a student uses their time at college to try to get a lucrative job (usually in finance or consulting). Less well-known is the fact that selling out to work at Goldman Sachs has a special reputation among the Harvard student body. Former University President Drew G. Faust joined Goldman’s board of directors days after she was finished with her tenure as Harvard’s president, resulting in lots of jokes on campus.
AirPods
These have become a worldwide phenomenon and a symbol for bougieness and workaholics, but the joke is even more relevant to Harvard. Stereotypically, Harvard students like to flex more than most people, and AirPods are the ultimate way to achieve that. The real inside joke, however, has to do with a relatively recent incident in which a student was robbed of their AirPods in Harvard Yard. The robber allegedly asked for the AirPods for a minute to see if their charger worked. While it’s certainly sad that this robbery happened, students joked about stealing AirPods for a while after the incident.
The Quad is Far
There are 12 residential houses you can live in after you spend your first year in one of the freshman dorms on campus. You’re randomly sorted into your house on Housing Day, which happens in the middle of your first spring semester. Nine of the houses are called “river houses” because they are close to the Charles River. The other three constitute the Quad, or what used to be Radcliffe College (which, when Harvard was all-male, was its female counterpart), so they’re a bit farther (think a few minutes walking difference) than the rest of the houses. How much farther and whether that’s actually a good thing is still debated.
Mather House is Ugly
Another one of the houses you can be sorted into is Mather House. The joke here is that while other houses may look ornate and New England-esque with their brick walls and bell towers, Mather looks like a concrete slab sticking up into the sky. In other words, many people joke that it’s rather ugly, though others disagree. But, as the saying goes, “You don’t need to look at Mather if you live in it!”
“Transformative Experience”
This phrase is one that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana uses pretty often to describe what he hopes Harvard College will be for undergraduates. He used it so much, though, that the phrase has taken on a sort of mythic status. Students joke that everything is supposed to be a transformative experience, from the dhall food to the late nights.

SATURDAY
Student-Led Campus Tour
10-11:15 a.m.
This is one of the more practical events. Not only will you get to familiarize yourself with some of Harvard’s most iconic scenes, but you will also be able to get your bearings as you navigate this exciting campus. This is your chance to be the VIP of your Visitas friend group by actually knowing the lay of the land rather than being hopelessly lost.
President's Welcome
3-4 p.m.
Come listen to the words and wisdom of Harvard’s President, Lawrence S. Bacow. Keep in mind that this event tends to be popular (both among parents and students), so get to Sanders Theater before the seats fill up!
FYRE Panel: Thriving at Harvard

It takes some time to get used to college life. The first few weeks of freshman year are defined by helplessly running around campus, trying to find your next class (where in the world is Vanserg?), figuring out which clubs to join, and learning to find your place within the chaos of nearly 2,000 people doing very similar things. Harvard doesn’t make it any easier for you by flooding you with its own complicated vernacular of acronyms and terminology. Rather than asking an upperclassman and risking weird looks, refer to this helpful guide to decode “Harvard speak.”
CGIS: Center for Government and International Studies
/see-jiss/
There will be a time when you have to go to CGIS whether it be for a class, meeting, or orientation. It happens to the best of us, and at some point, you’ll need to figure out where it is. CGIS is located on Cambridge Street past Annenberg: It is an orange building with glass doors. CGIS consists of the Knafel building and the South building which are right across the street from each other, and it would do you well to distinguish between the two early on.
HUHS: Harvard University Health Services
/aytch-yoo-aytch-ess/
Sometimes you’re sick. Sometimes you make bad decisions during a night out. It happens. HUHS is here for you during these times, and you will come to know its offices once you’re a student.
HUDS: Harvard University Dining Services
/huds/
The meals you grab in the dining hall are the result of the tireless and loving work of HUDS. Say hello to HUDS staff members when you see them because it takes a lot to feed thousands of hungry, sleep-deprived students, and HUDS staff are consistently some of the kindest people on campus.
HUPD: Harvard University Police Department
/hup-dee/
Found roaming campus during any event remotely associated with alcohol, HUPD officers can be identified by their uniforms and the bright red crest on their shoulders. They are here to keep you safe, rush you over to the hospital if you’ve had too much to drink, or open your door when you’ve lost your keys.
CS50: Computer Science 50: Introduction to Computer Science
/see-ess-fif-tee/
This. Is. A class that many choose to take in their first year. As somewhat of a rite of passage, this course is defined by its renowned instructor, David J. Malan ’99, and its exponential learning curve. Whether it’s ripping a phonebook in half, presenting the result of your blood, sweat, and tears at the CS50 Fair, or spotting an “I took CS50” t-shirt in a crowd, you will come to interact with this course at some point in your time here.
The MAC: The Malkin Athletic Center
/thuh mak/
Many freshmen start off with lofty goals regarding the premier student gym, but don’t be surprised if such goals end up going out the window. The MAC is outfitted with cardio equipment, three strength rooms, a pool, and basketball courts. If working out alone isn’t your thing, you can always get your Zumba on with their free group classes — that is, if you manage to make it to the MAC in the first place.
Think that was a lot? Unfortunately, this guide is far from exhaustive for all the acronyms and confusing terms thrown around on campus. Don’t worry — with time comes knowledge, and learning how to speak the Harvard language is just another part of the transformative experience.

You’ll definitely want to see what Harvard’s campus has to offer at Visitas. If this is your first time exploring the area, though (that guided admissions tour you took freshman year doesn’t count), even figuring out where to start can be a challenge. Lucky for you, we’ve put together 10 great spots to visit when you find free time in your Visitas schedule.
The John Harvard Statue
Take an officially-not-a-tourist-anymore photo, and remember to wash your hands before eating if you touch the foot. With so many visitors touching it every day, John Harvard’s metal foot is really not the most sanitary spot on campus.
The Smith Campus Center
The Smith Campus Center just opened last fall and sports quirky chairs, plant walls, and cafes to eat at. You can even try going up to the top floor for a stunning view of campus. Stop by to soak in the bright colors and general sense of pleasantness here.
Harvard Art Museums
Visit for a beautiful and unique way to spend an afternoon. The collection is quite impressive, and during Visitas you’ll get free admission.
Natural History Museum
If you’re more of a STEM person, try the Natural History Museum instead. Again, you’ll have free admission, so there’s no excuse not to check it out. Current exhibits include ones featuring glass flowers, glow-in-the-dark ocean-inspired paintings, and arthropods.
The Charles River
Go at sunset! It’s undeniably beautiful, and if you walk over from the Yard you’ll get to pass some of the upperclassmen houses (you’ll live in one of those from sophomore to senior year) and see what they look like.
Widener
Stop by the iconic library itself. Its stone steps are a great place to sit when the weather’s nice, and if you write a thesis this is probably where you’ll take a photo with it. If you decide to go in, remember to be mindful of the people studying inside so you don’t get any unpleasant glares.
Annenberg Hall
Members of the general public can’t enter Annenberg, so you’ll feel a little like a celebrity when you walk in for the first time. Enjoy the first of your many meals here!
Curious George Store
This is the only one in the world, and it’s right here in Harvard Square. Need we say more?
The Quad
The Radcliffe Quad is home to three of Harvard’s 12 upperclassmen houses, the studio that dance groups use, and the Student Organization Center at Hilles (a building used by various extracurricular groups). It could become a big part of your life depending on your upperclassmen housing assignment and which extracurriculars you get involved in, so getting a glimpse of it now might be a good idea. Don’t be shy; it doesn’t bite.
The COOP
Head to the largest bookstore in the Square to find a souvenir for yourself or a Harvard Mom/Dad shirt for those back home. If you’re looking for other Harvard gear vendors, there are plenty of options around the Square. These include but are not limited to the stand near the Harvard Square T stop as well as The Harvard Shop, which is run by students.
There’s lots to do on campus, so pull out your Google Maps and start exploring. Which of these places could you see yourself spending a lot of time at next year?

You’ve cleared your schedule, bought your plane tickets, and are officially headed to Visitas. While you may be focused on just how many events you can fit into a single day (here’s a hint: It’s fewer than you think), another cool part of this weekend is actually where you’ll be sleeping at night. Staying with a host is one of your first opportunities to check out a dorm or upperclassman house, find other prefrosh to meet, and get to know someone who already lives on campus. While some of us can’t even remember the name of our Visitas hosts, we’ve got some tips that will make this part of your weekend as great and unforgettable as possible.
Don’t Trash Their Room
At this point in the semester, our rooms are probably already pretty gross, and we’ve just cleaned them to make sure you don’t judge us. So please, don’t let all that hard work go to waste. You don’t have to be spotless, but just keeping your things in one area of the room and throwing away your trash can go a long way. You’ll have plenty of time next year to be just as messy as we are now!
Do Respond to Their Messages
It’s 2 a.m. and you’re still sitting in the Science Center chatting with your new friends and avoiding your hosts texts asking for your ETA back at their dorm. We’ve all been there, but please, just end our suffering (and yours) and respond so we know you’re not lost in the middle of Boston and we can leave a key out for you.
Don’t Make it Your Hang-Out Spot
Your host may have a thriving snack supply, but Visitas is the perfect time to *actually* meet other prefrosh — which can’t happen if you’re sitting inside the whole time. And when you do find a squad, there are plenty of places to get to know each other that don’t include where your host may be working, sleeping, or already screaming about their upcoming finals. Check out some dorm common rooms, the Smith Campus Center, or maybe even outside if the weather is finally cooperating.
Do Ask Questions!
Sure, we might not have all the answers (scratch that, we definitely don’t), but we do know what it’s like to feel completely clueless about Harvard, and honestly some of us probably still feel like that. Whether you want advice about the best events to go to, have questions about random Harvard things, or even just need directions, really don’t be afraid to ask!
Be a good hostee, but above all, enjoy Visitas!
