After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BERLIN—Act I. Exposition.
All the young comrades sing on the street.
Arm aber sexy—poor but sexy—is the unofficial motto of Berlin these days. And fair enough, in a city that boasts half the per capita GDP of Detroit or Birmingham yet finds itself at the heart of world art, music, and fashion. 21 percent of Berliners are on welfare—and the rest dress like they are. It’s snarky, it’s hip, it’s vaguely dishonest. It’s also really damned cool.
When I first arrived here, I was ready for some edgy. I’d just spent a few days in stuffy old Vienna, where the first bar I visited was a beach bar—ja, an Austrian beach bar, complete with strawberry daquiris, sunburnt Brits and ethnically ambiguous staff in banana skirts. They were playing a typical series of Euro-club hits—blurry, indistinct hours of You will never feel alone / My touch is such a rush / It overflows—while I stared at the Danube through a cloud of hookah smoke and dreamed of Turkish horsemen. And then I began pondering the question that’s bothered me since I started watching Eurovision: what is it with Europeans and crappy English song lyrics? 
They just love the stuff. And when I got to Berlin, eager to try out my rusty old German, it was hardly any better: the English language seemed to rescue the lamest of lines from embarrassing kitsch. I ride my bike past Party Bar on my way to White Trash Fast Food; later on, people much cooler than me will end up at Cookies or Watergate while I kick back at Roses. Crappy English even dominates the lyrics that sneak in between wobbles and slaps in the post-grunge industrial lo-organic gypsy-step that anyone who’s anyone listens to these days. From last weekend:
Bitch / Bitch / Ride the white pony / Bitch / Bitch / Ride the white pony / Bitch / bitch/ Ride the white pony.
 Pop and electro lyrics have always been dumb. But the Old Continent seems happy to put up with a whole other level of cliché and kitsch—even the earnestly blasé scenesters hardly put up a fight—and suddenly I’m wishing I didn’t speak such good English, because how much fun would it be to sing along to Eurovision with neither irony nor shame?
Act II. Contrapunto.
And they are greeted by the slogans of the people.
I don’t think it’s just that English is sexier, or more expressive, or the lingua franca buoyed by Hollywood and Wall Street. The English-speaking audience, too, seems to give extra points for songs with foreign language elements: Arriverdeci, Darling; Que Sera Sera; Vamos a la Playa. These sorts of songs surely profit from their recognizable—but still unusual—phrases, which would sound downright silly released to the charts in English. Even modern-day troubadours like Bieber and Derulo would struggle to pull off “Let’s go to the beach / I like to dance / Rhythm of the night / Sounds of the party.”
And I must confess to taking a few hundred photos of street art stencils with epigrams like KAPITALISMUS TÖTET (“capitalism kills”) and KUNST IST FREIHEIT (“art is freedom”)—as well as listening to old German pop music that most native speakers now find inane (see: Nein, Mann). Maybe there’s just something special about phrases in foreign languages that make them seem more meaningful than they are—or, instead, that reveal to us the meaning that has been there all along without our noticing. Something that lets us sing out at the top of our lungs that, yes, we would very much like to go to the beach, and no, we don’t want to think too hard about it at all.
Act III. Synthesis.
They march together, and all are one.
My favorite moments as a language learner—and a word lover—are the ones when you stop and think about how another language expresses a familiar concept in a way that is both completely strange and entirely sensible. In German, instead of saying there is, you say it gives; instead of I wonder, you say I ask myself.
~~
I am standing on the subway, looking blankly through the window at a piece of the Berlin Wall that’s lurching by. It’s only after a while that I notice I’m being addressed by a homeless man, whose hair is more like a mane and whose eyes are just so damned hard to look at. He asks me for money and I wave him away; it doesn’t feel as bad in a foreign country for some reason.
“Entschuldigung,” I say. (Pardon me, literally remove my blame).
“Schönen Tag” (Have a nice day).
And then he gets off the train and I stare at the glass while I think about what I actually just said—and whether I ever really thought words could achieve that sort of thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON—A few weekends ago, in the span of just a few hours, I went from being the most spendthrift person in the room to being the most frugal one.
The weekend began in Washington, D.C., where my roommate and I are interning at a software company. Although we earn identical salaries—and even hail from similar socioeconomic backgrounds—he often views my purchases as excessive, while his spending strikes me as ascetic.
On Friday morning, as I departed for my daily trip to Starbucks, he flashed his usual half-smile and opted to get his coffee from the office kitchen. In the afternoon, I stifled a chuckle as he explained to a coworker that, though we would both be visiting New York City that weekend, he would be taking a midnight bus because it was several dollars cheaper than my afternoon one.
Though these disagreements about money are never confrontational, they have forced me to think about how I can justify spending more than my roommate. I’ve tended to adopt the attitude that neither of us has the “right” approach, but that we each spend in accordance with our own appetites and values.
However, my “to each his own” attitude was challenged during my trip to New York, when I found myself in the apartment of several high school friends working in finance. I listened in shock as one friend told me he had dropped $2,500 during a three-day trip to Las Vegas; later that night, he spent over $240 in the span of a few hours at a nearby bar. Over the course of the weekend, I heard other stories of coworkers who spent thousands of dollars on handbags, or spontaneously hired helicopters to the Hamptons.
To me, these expenses were more than a waste of money—they were conspicuous consumption, evidence of a misplaced value on extravagance. But, I wondered, couldn’t my roommate level the same criticism at me, with my habitual venti chai lattes?
In the weeks that have followed, I’ve found no easy answers to this question. But I’ve realized that my own spending needs a little bit more scrutiny than a flippant “to each his own.” Wrestling with my approach to money—and, in a broader sense, privilege—may be the most important task of my fast-approaching senior year.
Because at Harvard, we often talk about how wealth impacts the broader world, but we don’t always think about how we could be a part of that trend. And in just a few years, we will all leave this school with the privilege of an Ivy League education, and the associated earning potential. We will enter a world where the disparity between haves and have-nots grows wider every day.
How we choose to “use” our privilege—by spending lavishly or living abstemiously, donating graciously or forgoing money to spend time with loved ones—will play a major role in defining our identities.
The question of individual spending will never be an easy one. But I’m looking forward to talking through it with my friends over the next year. Whether these conversations will be happening at Starbucks—well, that’s still to be decided.

SEOUL, South Korea—My stomach growls in protest as I gulp down another spoonful of shaved ice and sweetened red bean puree.
I pinch my stomach with one hand and quickly jot down some notes with the other: “The shaved ice, made with frozen milk, melted like snow right as it touched the tip of my tongue. The chunky red bean puree wasn’t overly sweet, while the slices of fresh kiwis and crunchy candied walnuts added texture to the otherwise watery bingsu.
After gathering enough information, I head out the door. Despite my bulging stomach, my footsteps do not lead me home, but to yet another café for yet another bowl of shaved ice.
As a food aficionado, I had often dreamed of being a food critic for a major newspaper. My dream became a reality when I interned as a reporter for Chosun Ilbo, the largest daily newspaper in South Korea. As a pitch, I suggested writing an article on where to find the best of Korea’s favorite summer dessert, patbingsu (shaved ice with red bean puree, rice cake, fruits, and other toppings) in Seoul. The editor welcomed the idea, and so began my bingsu adventure.
Since I had a limited time to visit as many bingsu cafes as possible, I would skip lunch and dinner to leave enough room in my stomach for two to three bowls of bingsu every day. At first I enjoyed the sweet and savory red bean puree with the frosty taste of shaved ice that immediately cooled my heated body in the humid Korean heat. However, after about four bowls, I had all but overdosed, and my stomach longed for something warm.
Five days, fifteen bingsu, and ten extra pounds later, I am finally finished reporting. Despite the thrill of being a food critic, I have realized that food tastes best when paid for with your own money and shared with your family and friends, not when dissected in detail and recorded in pen. Though I don’t have the courage to consume another shaved ice this season, I will leave Korea with a confident answer to an important question—that is, should anyone ever ask me where to find Seoul’s best bingsu cafe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The total value of Harvard's U.S.-traded equities dropped 13 percent to $1.2 billion last quarter, as Harvard Management Company continued to invest in emerging markets.
In the previous quarter, the University held $1.4 billion in U.S.-traded stocks. Both values are on par with post-financial crisis total investment value. In the quarters ending on June 30 in both 2010 and 2009, the total value rested at about $1.4 billion.
The University is required to report its direct holdings of U.S.-listed securities to the Securities and Exchange Commission each quarter. The filing for Harvard’s fiscal fourth quarter, released Friday, represents only the stocks managed directly by the HMC. HMC also contracts with outside money managers to invest a large portion of the endowment.
This snapshot of Harvard's holdings reflects a period before the turmoil that has rocked markets in recent weeks.
The report from the most recent quarter shows that the University is continuing the trend of investing in exchange-trade funds that track the performance of emerging economies, including Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, and Turkey.
The University has also invested directly in a Korean corporation called Korean Electric Power, and in Indian companies WisdomTree Trust and Tata Motors. Last year the Tata foundation gave Harvard Business School $50 million--the largest international donation in over 100 years.
The most recent filing reveals that Harvard sold a stake in Halliburton, the oilfield services company that has been caught up in controversy surrounding the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. One of last year's filings showed that Harvard owned a $4.8 million stake in Halliburton.
The University continues to hold onto its stock in the real estate market. The University has $52.4 million invested in Pebblebook Hotel Trust, a hotel development company.
Harvard came under fire last year for its supposed investments in HEI Hotels & Resorts, a hotel company that has been accused of violating workers’ rights. The SEC filing indicates that Harvard does not have a direct investment in HEI, although it is possible that they own stock through an outside money manager.
The University’s endowment suffered heavy blows during the financial crisis, resulting in a nearly 30 percent plunge in value. The endowment has begun to recover since, although results for fiscal year 2011, which ended June 30, have not yet been released.
Prior to the financial crisis, the total value of stocks held was much higher--$3.3 billion in 2008 and $4.12 billion in 2007. Changing investment strategy at HMC, in addition to market declines, contributed to the sharp decrease in directly held stocks in the years after 2008.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former men’s basketball starter Max Kenyi will not be back in a Harvard uniform this fall, Kenyi told The Crimson this afternoon.
“I won’t be back,” said Kenyi, who took a voluntary leave of absence from Harvard for personal reasons this past October—just two months into his junior year.
At the time, Kenyi told The Crimson he intended to rejoin the Harvard basketball program after his year off.
But after a summer in which he reportedly played in a summer league with a team of incoming Georgetown freshmen, rumors began to swirl that the athletic guard out of Maryland would be leaving the Crimson to join the Hoyas.
Kenyi declined to comment on the rumors, except to confirm that he would be leaving Harvard.
“I can’t really elaborate on it,” Kenyi said. “Can’t really talk about it.”
Kenyi also declined to comment on the reasoning behind his decision not to return to Cambridge, saying, “Just leave it at I’m not going to be back.”
In his two seasons with the Crimson, Kenyi started 19 games and averaged 4.7 points per game. One of the top recruits from Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s first recruiting class, Kenyi was used primarily as a defensive stopper.
But the 2007-08 Gatorade District of Columbia Boys Basketball Player of the Year of the Year struggled on the offensive end and was hobbled by an MCL injury that limited him to just 17 games during his sophomore season.
