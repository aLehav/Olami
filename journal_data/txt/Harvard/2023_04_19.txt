After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mental health crisis on campus rages on, and it is still not clear what to do to address the depression and anxiety that plague the student body. Barring the addition of more therapists — which I maintain does not address the central problem — there are two approaches which may improve the mental health of this community: a top down approach, where the existing medical care is made accessible to everyone, and a bottom up approach, where a culture of care and support is allowed to bloom.
One of the great ironies of mental health care is that those who need it the most often struggle the most to ask for it. Reaching out for help requires a level of vulnerability and willingness that is incredibly hard to muster while struggling with mental illness. The times in my life that I have most needed a therapist were also the times where I was most resistant to getting one.
It is for this very reason that getting mental health care must be made as effortless as possible.
As it stands, the process to receive mental health care can be difficult and opaque: Counseling and Mental Health Services has long wait times, and poorly explained policies on mandatory leaves of absence can make students resistant to get care.
What’s more, many students are not aware of the resources that are actually available. This is a total bureaucratic failure. The hard problem of providing access to care has largely been solved, but the University has flubbed the final step of execution: making these resources well understood.
Currently, much of the information surrounding mental health resources comes in boring administrative emails (which likely don’t get read). It is high time that TimelyCare and the CAMHS Cares hotline become so familiar to students and faculty alike that they become obvious, approachable frontline treatments.
To make these resources familiar, the campus should first be flooded with information. Info sessions should be run at every house and freshman entryway, posters should coat every bulletin board, and short direct emails should be blasted to every student, repeatedly. It should be impossible to not know how to get psychotherapy or other mental health resources on this campus.
Beyond that, though, mental health access coordinators should be implemented to make access to care effortless. In the moment of a mental health crisis, a student should be able to fire off a text or press a button, and be rapidly connected to someone who will help them navigate the options available to them — such as registering for TimelyCare, accessing peer counseling services, or scheduling with CAMHS through the (remarkably confusing) Harvard University Health Services patient portal. With the right organization, mental health care could be one click away.
When healthy behavior is easy and incentivized, mental health is far easier to maintain. On the other hand, when students are constantly pushing against the tide, mental health is incredibly difficult to maintain.
This brings us to the second approach to improve mental health here: making Harvard a place where it is already easy to live healthily.
The core components of healthy living worth worrying about are physical health and social wellbeing. A person who is well rested and feels loved and cared for by their friends and family will be much more able to manage the slings and arrows of life.
What sort of campus allows for this mental health? A campus where late night grind sessions aren’t necessary — where extensions are granted, and even lauded, in the name of a good night of sleep. A campus where peer counselors, who take the care of the community into their own hands, are celebrated and compensated for their work. A campus where huge social events — on the scale of Yardfest and Harvard-Yale — happen more often than once a semester, and where clubs are built around fellowship, rather than play-acting as consultants. A campus where the administration understands that the happiness of Harvard students is not a distraction from incredible achievements, but rather an institutional obligation of the highest degree.
Addressing mental health in this fashion may read as trivializing the very significant difficulty of mental illness. To be clear, I do not mean to argue that all mental health concerns come down to sleep, exercise, and friendship. However, it is clinically true that care focused on these areas — such as interpersonal psychotherapy, which focuses on creating and managing healthy relationships — significantly reduces depressive symptoms.
One worries about the extent to which Harvard’s mental health crisis is solvable. The stress and misery of the Harvard student seems to trace its origins to the raw drive for achievement that it takes to get into this school. This place is so dense with opportunity that every second could be spent doing something that will bring us closer to our goals. Faced with such incredible optionality, it can be wildly difficult to say no, and prioritize our own wellbeing.
God knows that I struggle with this in my own life. Still, it is possible to have a culture of striving for excellence without self-destruction. The resources to take care of ourselves are there, though they have not been distributed well. With proper management and a bit of creativity, perhaps we can make this a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was around this time last year that I had gotten back all of my college acceptances, and began to come to terms with the reality of leaving behind my friends and family in northern California to attend Harvard. For months I had claimed that moving far from home didn’t scare me, but once the decision was made, the first instances of doubt quickly crept in.
Long, expensive travel days to and from Visitas opened my eyes to the fact that if I moved across the country, my family and friends would not often be able to visit me. The reprieve of a weekend trip home would be wholly impractical. And as the summer before my first year progressed, more reasons for doubt crept in: Moving my belongings across the country became a logistical nightmare, and the reality of not personally knowing anyone else attending Harvard set in.
What had I gotten myself into?
This uncertainty left me seeking reassurance, but in the wake of the excitement and enthusiasm surrounding my acceptance, I was scared to voice these doubts. To high school seniors wondering whether moving far away for school is a good idea, I’m here to offer you that reassurance I once sought.
It’s been about eight months since I moved, and while I miss my favorite coffee shop and getting to pet my dog, there have been a number of unexpected joys from moving thousands of miles away from home.
At Harvard, for the first time in many years, I had the chance to make an entirely new set of friends. There was no petty drama of “cutting people off” or “dropping” familiar faces — I was in a new place, surrounded by entirely new people. Losing the built-in companionship of family forced me to totally reorient my everyday interactions and surround myself with friends that supported me the same way.
If you’re scared to leave people behind, a daily walk across campus becomes an opportunity for hometown gossip, and with nobody local around to overhear, you can fearlessly drop first and last names. In other words: I’ve gotten good at talking on the phone. The distance will reveal who from home you can live without, and who you can’t. Then, when term breaks come around, you can make time for the people who really matter. Without the bristling caused by everyday interactions, conflict dwindles and reunions tend to be sweet and nostalgic.
The time difference from Massachusetts to California means that I can wake up late and go to bed late, and my family will idyllically trail three hours behind me. I often find myself on the phone with them after I’ve stayed up finishing an assignment; it’s midnight here, but it’s only 9 p.m. back home, and not even my 12-year-old brother has been sent to bed.
Also, nobody here has to know what activities I did in high school, so there’s no social pressure keeping me from making changes and trying new things. I’ve made big changes — like some friends I’ve made here, I no longer run competitively as I did in high school — but making little changes can be refreshing too. I could have picked a brand new favorite color upon arriving at Harvard, and instead of my childhood best friend questioning when I swayed from blue to green, everyone here would have just smiled and said okay to this revolutionary new answer.
As the incoming class of 2027 continues to scour informational pages, make pro-con lists, and travel for admitted students days like Visitas in the lead up to acceptance deadlines, I want to offer assurance that distance from home is a factor worth embracing, not cowering away from. As you prepare to move away, you’ll shove your belongings into oversized Ikea zipper bags, ship dorm supplies you ordered online to your brand-new mailing address, and relish the opportunity to reinvent your life: yourself, your friends, your daily routine.
A fresh start, newfound independence, and a potential reputation rebrand all feel like cliché reasons to move away, but don’t dismiss them: Let yourself explore and rediscover.
The opportunity to move away is a privilege, and if you do have that choice, I urge you to consider taking it. Move across the country, move across the world, and I have a feeling you’ll find your own reasons to be grateful you did.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The tangy odor of cardamom and cinnamon drifts from the freshly brewed masala chai that aunties and uncles sip, dancing with the sugary aroma wafting from the children’s cotton-candy machine. At the entrance of our Ramadan Suhoor tent, I hear a chorus of familiar, gentle laughter and soft murmurs of conversation in the moonlight. As I whisper the words of the Quran and hear its soft sound grace my ears, a feeling of peace washes over me.
Rejuvenated by this oasis of community, I am eager for another day of fasting. I forage for the rest of my family, covertly clutching my wand of cotton candy and savoring sparse samples of chai en route. Just as we become united and begin to say our “farewell salams,” we happily bump into old friends who pause our return home.
This is how I remember spending my childhood Ramadans at the Islamic Center of Greater Cincinnati.
Each year during Ramadan, the excitement of being together is palpable; with only 30 days available, each night is irreplaceable. Ramadan represents much more than merely the physical experiences of hunger or thirst that come with fasting from dawn to sunset. Abstaining from external pleasures of food and drink requires a degree of self-discipline, a kind of restraint which often compels me to refrain from forms of excess consumption.
Ramadan encourages self-reflection, while being interspersed with communal experiences; the combination synthesizes the perfect playground for spiritual cultivation. The experience compels me to improve my character, patience, and contribution to the world around me, in ways simply not possible in the other eleven months of the year.
Night by night, the chaotic yet cozy environment within my childhood Suhoor tent fused with tranquil, early morning Fajr and late night Taraweeh prayers to catalyze my yearning to come to the masjid — the Islamic place of worship — as often as possible. Only there, at the masjid, did I really ever feel my world slowing down and my own focus stabilizing amid the entropy of everyday life, promoting my desire to remain.
Rooted in the lunar calendar, the month of Ramadan shifts earlier each year in relation to the Gregorian calendar. As a consequence of calendar misalignment, Ramadan, once an anchor of my summer breaks, has now creeped into term time. Now, long nights spent standing in Taraweeh are occasionally substituted for note-taking at my desk. And for many Muslim students across the world, this year’s Ramadan may be the first time that they practice away from their own family, friends, and communities from home.
I’ll be honest: A pivotal factor in my college decision process rested upon how each campus community supported Muslims during Ramadan. It was important to me that my school environment would foster my ability to grow and improve in all aspects of my life, not just academics.
Ramadan at Harvard has enhanced my experience in unprecedented ways. With strong support and direction from full-time University Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, and Harvard’s first female Muslim Chaplain Samia Omar, Harvard students and affiliates have access to an enriching and welcoming community. The joint effort of the Muslim Chaplaincy and the Office of the President have created an environment where Muslim students can experience Ramadan on-campus more comfortably with assured nightly programming.
As a Muslim at Harvard, I am surrounded by ample resources, which I would not have without the advocacy and work of those who have come before me. Yet this is not the norm across higher education. Many simple marks of support, such as a designated Islamic prayer space, are still subjects of stagnant discussions being held at other universities across the country.
It is imperative that other higher education institutions model similar institutional support to their Muslim students, staff, and faculty, both during and after Ramadan. Carefully designing resources and support for Ramadan necessitates months of full-time preparation — a feat that is best accomplished by dedicated staff rather than a small handful of self-organized students. Chaplains Omar and Abdur-Rashid have ensured that all Harvard affiliates can join together in community dinners and congregational prayers during every night of Ramadan. With their assistance, the number of participants in these events has increased to nearly 600 students in the past year alone.
As I reflect on this past Ramadan, I cannot help but appreciate the palpable sense of excitement and energy on campus akin to my oasis of community at home. Building off ideation and excitement from last year, together, Muslim students have organized and planned activities this Ramadan. In collaboration with Associate Dean of Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro and the Dean of Students Office, we, the Harvard Islamic Society, have created Weekly Community Suhoors to teach all students about Ramadan. In addition, we are hosting a larger celebration for Eid al-Fitr, the Islamic Holiday that concludes this month of fasting.
On a more personal level, students have brought Ramadan traditions from their homes to campus, whether that involves decorating iftar spaces with lights, giving Eid gifts to children, or creating fundraising initiatives campus-wide.
Now nestled within the Student Organization Center at Hilles, a makeshift prayer room recalls those same, precious moments of laughter and conversation I shared years earlier at home. The adhan (call to prayer) echoes through the room, and the community, bustling with people of all different ages, backgrounds, and studies, pauses to reflect and give thanks for the blessings of the day.
As I look forward to these last few nights filled with prayer, reflection, and togetherness, I am grateful to have such a special and meaningful community here at Harvard.

Former United States Senator Richard M. Burr (R-N.C.) and Lanhee J. Chen ’04, policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, discussed the future of American health care policy at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Tuesday evening.
The discussion, co-sponsored by the Harvard School of Public Health, was moderated by HSPH professor John E. McDonough. In their conversation, Burr and Chen discussed federal health care policies, including the Affordable Care Act and Medicare, as well as health care reform.
Burr, a Republican who opposed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and voted to repeal it in 2017, defended his stance based on his personal experience on an “Obamacare plan.”
“I got to live through what it's like to have to participate in it, and there was no advocate, advocating for change in Obamacare — from a standpoint of how it's structured — where every insured life in an insurance plan is a lobbyist for changing the plan to reflect what they need,” Burr said. “What I found was, everybody in Obamacare — they have no voice in it.”
Discussing mental and behavioral health care, Chen said the U.S. is in an “epidemic” and called for increased funding toward research and health institutions, as well as “continuing to remove the stigma around seeking help.”
“Why don’t we have more foreign trained mental health providers and allow them to practice the top of their license in the United States? That’s a supply side reform that Congress, the states, could enact right away to ensure that we get the right supply of providers,” Chen said.
In addition to mental health-related issues, McDonough said America has been underperforming relative to similar developed countries on key health metrics.
“In the last decade — five out of 10 years now — we’ve seen life expectancy drop dramatically compared to our other West European peers,” he said.
Chen said the U.S. can learn from the the Singaporean health care system, which he described as more transparent and data-driven.
“What the Singaporeans do in their health care system is create radical levels of transparency around cost and quality,” Chen said.
Besides systemic changes to the health care system, Burr said there should be policies focused on helping Americans receive care before situations reach an emergency stage.
“In every hospital in America, where you got a door that says emergency room, cut a door next to it, and put primary care,” Burr said. “Let people know that they don't have to get sick to get medical care.”
“Participation is the solution to the problem we’ve got in this country,” he said.

Former South Korean business minister Young-sun Park and social media CEO Will Hohyon Ryu discussed potential applications of artificial intelligence to democracy during a talk at Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday.
The event — hosted by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation in collaboration with the Harvard Korea Institute — was moderated by Jeeyang Rhee Baum, an adjunct lecturer at HKS. The discussion centered on the large language model ChatGPT, Ryu’s social media platform OXOpolitics, and AI in general.
More than 50 people attended the event, which was held in the Kennedy School’s Land Hall.
Park, South Korea’s former minister of small and medium enterprises and startups and a fellow at the Rajawali Foundation Institute for Asia, opened the event with a discussion of the concept of “liquid democracy,” a form of direct democracy where voters can directly weigh in on policy decisions or choose to delegate their vote to a representative.
“Liquid democracy empowers direct participation,” Park said.
Many democracies are currently experiencing crises of polarization, according to Park. In nations like the U.S. and South Korea, stark divisions between the political left and right mean that politics “are not representing the voice of all the public,” she said, sparking dissatisfaction with politicians and systems of representation.
To address this, Park said, governments should turn to new advances in technology to make politics more representative. By facilitating “direct communication among the people and convergence of the people’s opinion,” technology can “supplement the shortcomings of representative democracy.”
Ryu, the OXOpolitics founder, said a shortcoming of representative democracy is the “middlemen” who stand between the voters and their representatives.
“It’s not always the case that my representatives’ words really represent me,” Ryu said.
Park said AI can complement representatives, synthesizing voters’ opinions in an accessible way.
“AI is the most efficient way to make the direct democracy possible,” Park said.
For example, Park discussed how a South Korean startup recently used ChatGPT to compile citizens’ views on South Korea’s relationship with Japan — filtering through hundreds of thousands of online posts to create a comprehensive summary of public opinion.
“This system opened a new possibility for determining politics widely by analyzing the opinion of the conservatives and progressives in less [than] one minute,” she said. “This is the first step to getting closer to digital democracy.”
Similarly, Ryu said he developed the social media platform OXOpolitics to connect voters directly to politicians. The platform collects users’ opinions on political issues and visualizes the data for politicians to see.
Ryu said OXOpolitics is a form of liquid democracy because it allows each individual to weigh in on political issues themselves.
“Imagine there’s an AI that understands me better than myself,” he said. “We are trying to bring AI-assisted liquid democracy into reality.”
Ryu acknowledged, however, the dangers of introducing artificial intelligence into political systems.
“We are doing a really dangerous thing,” he said. “Bringing AI — not human intelligence but artificial intelligence — to politics is potentially disruptive.”
Park argued that developers can avoid these dangers by upholding five ethical principles: transparency, safety, responsibility, fairness, and goodwill. Ryu agreed that it is important to hold AI ethically accountable.
“We can follow AI’s recommendations, but ultimately, humans still have the responsibility as citizens to make the right decisions,” he said.
To ensure that algorithms make beneficial decisions for the public, Ryu’s platform includes an explanation of where the algorithm’s recommendations come from.
“With transparency, you can trust AI,” he said.
In the end, Ryu said, AI is just a tool whose users must decide how it contributes to democracy.
“AI could be a dictator that tells us what to do,” Ryu said. “But the same time, it can be a representative.”

The Harvard Undergraduate Association voted to allocate $5,000 to Senior Week during its weekly meeting Monday.
Senior Week, a weeklong celebration of graduating Harvard College seniors between final exams and Commencement, features events like Senior Olympics and Senior Barbecue. The proposal passed with nine in favor and one unopposed.
Athena Q. Ye ’23, Class of 2023 first marshal, said the festivities will cost a projected $200,000, adding that the 2023 Senior Class Committee has already attempted to lower costs.
“We’ve been trying everything we can to cut the expenses that aren’t exactly needed,” Ye said. “For example, almost none of our events have alcohol.”
Ye said the HUA’s funding would lower the cost of tickets by $10 and “move the needle for a lot of people.” Without the HUA’s assistance, Senior Week tickets would cost $175.
Tickets to Senior Week events are typically discounted for Student Events Fund-eligible undergraduates.
HUA Co-President Shikoh Misu Hirabayashi ’24 said while the request was larger than those for other social events, it will also reach a large portion of the student body.
“Some of you might think that $5,000 is a lot compared to our previous Fun Fund fundings. For example, Woodbridge Formal was like $1,000,” Hirabayashi said. “But I will just echo again: Senior Week, this is for all the seniors. This is for one-fourth of the entire school.”
Travis Allen Johnson ’24, former HUA co-president and current extracurricular officer, suggested covering 30 students’ tickets fully, rather than giving every senior a $10 discount.
“Do you think it’s better to subsidize the costs entirely of roughly 30 students than to give everyone a $10 discount, which is so marginal?” Johnson asked. “I’d argue it may not even be meaningful, versus covering the entire thing for 30 people.”
Ye said she would bring Johnson’s suggestion to the other marshals. Hirabayashi said the HUA could vote on allocating $5,000 immediately and then discuss how it would be distributed to students later.
HUA Co-President John S. Cooke ’25 said the body could discuss any increases to Senior Week funding at its next general meeting.
Cooke also announced Ejike Ike ’25 as technological director for the HUA executive team. The technological director is responsible for maintaining the HUA’s website and mailing lists, according to an application for the position.
“I’m extremely excited to help the HUA in any way I can this current term and do my best in my role,” Ike said during the meeting.

Harvard’s Office of Career Services has been renamed the Mignone Center for Career Success following a “generous” donation to the College from Allison Hughes Mignone ’94 and her husband Roberto A. Mignone ’92, the career center announced Sunday.
The sum of the donation was not announced. Both donors, who also received their MBAs from Harvard Business School, have a history of generosity toward the College. In 2016, they contributed to the construction of a new rugby facility, which was subsequently named the Roberto A. Mignone Field.
Roberto Mignone is the founder and managing partner of New York-based investment management firm Bridger Management LLC. He also serves as vice chair of the American Museum of Natural History and as a trustee of the New York University Langone Medical Center.
Allison Mignone served as co-chair of the Class of 1994 Reunion Gift Committee and was named vice chair of the Museum of Natural History’s capital campaign.
The pair “have always been passionate about fostering strong academic advising and in particular career support for Harvard students and graduates to ensure they achieve the career success they aspire to,” Mignone Center Director Emanuel Contomanolis wrote in a Tuesday statement.
“A series of discussions with senior College leadership led to a generous gift to the College, including specifically earmarked support to the Office of Career Services. In recognition of that gift, the office has been renamed the Mignone Center for Career Success,” he wrote.
According to the statement, the center’s new name is intended to reflect its vision for “success specifically through the eyes of the learners.”
Contomanolis wrote that the gift has enabled the career office to renovate the first floor of their Dunster Street office building, “resulting in an open, far more inviting and engaging space.”
Contomanolis added that the center is also working to implement other initiatives supported by the gift, including a new website, more accessible career outcome data, and the introduction of a new interview practice platform.
The new platform, called “Big Interview,” offers “virtual interview practice and Ai feedback to improve performance,” according to Contomanolis’ email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana reiterated his commitment to free academic exchange in an interview Tuesday.
Last week, The Crimson reported that for nearly two years, Khurana has facilitated an “Intellectual Vitality Committee” comprised of Harvard undergraduates, faculty, and alumni. The group has quietly convened to discuss what they see as a lack of free idea exchange at the College.
Khurana said the group has discussed how to equip instructors to facilitate constructive debate in the classroom.
“Open dialogue and the ability to express oneself is at the foundation of democracy and academic freedom,” Khurana said. “A lot of what we have discussed is how do we strengthen active listening — how to think about skill building among teaching faculty for facilitating controversial or challenging dialogue.”
Khurana said that while several members of the committee have called on the College to release a statement in support of free inquiry, he thinks free idea exchange demands greater action.
“If intellectual vitality was as simple as releasing a statement, that would be more easily achieved, but I think that idea belongs in the kindergarten of social thought,” Khurana said. “What we’re talking about is capacity building for democracy, capacity building for a diverse community, to recognize that we can be hard on the problem and easy on each other.”
More than 80 Harvard faculty members are members of the newly formed Harvard Council on Academic Freedom, a group dedicated to promoting values of free speech and inquiry. The Council on Academic Freedom is a separate initiative from the group facilitated by Khurana.
As of Tuesday evening, Khurana had not joined the group, which was publicly announced last Wednesday.
“Today, there are many ideas that we accept as uncontroversial, but we have to remember most of those ideas were once seen as heterodox,” Khurana said. “We should also have humility in that what we believe to be true today may prove to be more contingent, complex, or not even true in the future.”
Khurana also addressed the following topics:
Leverett House ‘Swatting’
Khurana expressed concern and support for four undergraduates who were the victims of a recent “swatting” attack in Leverett House earlier this month.
“I am so sorry that what happened, happened,” Khurana said. “It was a terrible event, and I’m upset — frankly outraged — that something like this happens on our campus, that it happens in universities, in schools all around this country.”
Khurana said the College’s response — which was criticized by some students — was informed by prioritizing student wellbeing. The College did not release a statement on the attack for more than 48 hours, a delay that drew criticism from students.
Khurana declined to comment on how the University specifically supported the affected students, citing their privacy.
“In our responses, we can always do better, and we want to make sure that our students feel that they’re supported in all the ways they need to be and that we’re able to effectively work together as a team to give them that full support that we want to,” Khurana said.
Independent Student Organization Audit
Administrators from the Dean of Students Office said in an interview with The Crimson earlier this month that they are conducting an audit of independent student organizations in conjunction with Harvard’s risk management office.
The audit comes after a two-month Crimson investigation found that the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative was missing thousands of dollars after the departure of its former president. The audit was not prompted by the leadership dispute, according to Harvard spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo.
Khurana said there are many resources available to student leaders, adding that he hopes students “take advantage” of guides put out by the College’s administration.
“As we receive input from our students, as we hear from our leadership, we’re always in the process of improving our processes,” Khurana said.

In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, Harvard Athletics has showcased the achievements of Harvard female student-athletes, past and present, through a season’s worth of programming.
Title IX was passed on June 23, 1972, enshrining the prohibition of discrimination, exclusion, or denial of benefits on the basis of sex into law.
“No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” the law declared.
Half a century later, Harvard Athletics has dedicated its 2022-23 season to recognizing this milestone, holding lectures, interactive programming for female youth, games dedicated to Title IX, and a social media campaign to highlight Harvard female student-athletes.
The campaign began on June 23, 2022, with a virtual lecture titled “Title IX at 50: Progress Made and Challenges Ahead for Women’s Sports,” inviting current and former athletes — including Harvard women’s tennis head coach Traci Green — to reflect on personal experiences, progress, and future challenges related to Title IX.
Since the lecture, more than 15 teams at Harvard have honored the anniversary of Title IX at games this season in addition to postgame clinics and Crimson Pub pop-ups.
Harvard Athletics hosted a Title IX Celebration Weekend from Sept. 30 through Oct. 1 in the fall with games from five different teams, including football and women’s soccer.
This past weekend, the Harvard Varsity Club hosted a “50 Years of Title IX Celebration.” The weekend consisted of a welcome reception, an alumni panel discussion, and featured games from softball, women’s heavyweight rowing, and women’s lacrosse, concluding with a gala dinner at Lavietes Pavilion.
On Saturday, the home of Harvard basketball was transformed into a red carpet affair for the gala, a celebration of Harvard female student-athletes and alumni.
The gala event featured three Harvard alumni and pioneering women: award-winning journalist and broadcaster Soledad M. O’Brien ’88-’00, Massachusetts Governor Maura T. Healey ’92, and former Olympian, CEO and co-founder of the Sports Innovation Lab Angela Ruggiero ’04. O’Brien, Healey, and Ruggiero each gave remarks after receiving the Trailblazer Award.
The event also hosted hundreds of Harvard and Radcliffe alumni, current student-athletes, present and former coaches, deans, and many others who have dedicated themselves to furthering opportunities for Havard’s female student-athletes.
Harvard Varsity Club President Johanna Neilson Boynton ’88, an alumna of the women’s hockey program, put together the event alongside a committee of 11 others. The group brought together generations of female athletes for a night of celebrating their collective accomplishments and memories and for the creation of new friendships and mentorships.
Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott, who herself made history as the first woman to hold the role in University history, spoke about the opportunities Title IX provided her when she was a student-athlete.
During her remarks, McDermott celebrated the first female student-athletes to compete for Harvard as trailblazers. While not all of them could be in attendance on Saturday evening, those who were received a standing ovation as they were presented with varsity “H” sweaters, a traditional Harvard athletic sentiment they were never afforded during their athletic careers.
O’Brien, Healey, and Ruggiero each gave remarks after receiving the Trailblazer Award.
Introduced by her friend Sarah Leary, a two-time All-American and captain of the 1990 Harvard women’s lacrosse national championship team, Healey spoke on her early experience with sports as well as her time at Harvard.
Dropping her notes halfway through her remarks, Healey described the lessons she learned as an athlete and the opportunities Title IX afforded her. She said that without Title IX and basketball, she would not have been able to reach the office of Governor of Massachusetts.
Healey lauded the great advances in equity in women’s athletics over the years and congratulated the Harvard women’s basketball team and Coach Carrie Moore on their past season.
She reminded attendees, however, that the fight is far from over. Though Title IX as a law changed structural access and created opportunities for women and girls, societal attitudes are not as easily changed, Healey said.
She added that she was struck by the number of young girls she has encountered in recent months who have never heard of Title IX, stressing the importance of educating future generations on how far we have come and still have to go.
Following Healey’s remarks, a short video was played featuring Harvard women’s soccer alumni, including current U.S. national team member, Margaret M. “Midge” Purce ’17. Purce could not attend the gala due to a game with the National Women’s Soccer League’s N.J/N.Y. team Gotham FC but shared her enthusiasm for the festivities.
As the gala went on, Purce scored the game-winning goal for Gotham in their game against Orlando Pride on Saturday night in Orlando, Florida.
O’Brien’s speech centered on the same theme as Healey’s: opportunity. She reflected on her time at Harvard as “a time of possibilities – a time when so many doors opened for me and people like me.”
O’Brien noted that as a Black woman, she has had to overcome both sex-based discrimination and race-based discrimination. Her parents raised six children on Long Island after moving to New York to legally marry, as in their previous home of Maryland, interracial marriage was illegal until 1967. O’Brien was the fifth of six children to attend Harvard College.
O’Brien explained how the law “not only changed the legal landscape but created a set of values in this country about equality and opportunity.”
“We think of Title IX as sports equity, but it is [an] anti-discrimination civil rights law,” O’Brien said. “The original statue did not even mention sports.”
Now a mother of four children, O’Brien said her own children’s experiences in athletic programs — including soccer, lacrosse, and swimming — have given her a new perspective on disparities that still exist.
“You get to see how schools and organizations do or do not support kids equally,” O’Brien said. “I can tell you that the toughest thing to change is not the quality of the locker room or whether boys and girls get the same equipment. It is kind of easy to measure that.”
“There is a law and there is recourse. What is difficult to change is attitudes and perceptions and how they affect young women and girls,” she added.
In closing, O’Brien stressed the importance of changing people’s views on women’s athletics.,
“I can’t tell you how many times I have reported on discrimination and thought ‘Isn't this supposed to be against the law?’” O’Brien said. “But laws only go so far — the rest is up to you and me.”
Following a brief video from former Olympian and Harvard track and field alumnus Gabby Thomas ‘19, Boynton introduced Ruggiero, the final Trailblazer Award recipient.
Entertaining the audience with jokes all evening, Boynton got an especially large laugh from attendees when she remarked that Ruggiero won her first gold medal before earning her driver’s license.
A four-time All-American, four-time Olympic team member, and four-time World Team member, Ruggiero was also the Chief Strategy Officer for Los Angeles’s successful 2028 Olympic bid and serves as CEO of her company Sports Innovation Lab, among other endeavors.
After showing off her gold medal to the audience, Ruggiero discussed her own experiences with Title IX.
From dressing as a professional hockey player at her elementary school career day, to becoming the first woman to play professionally in a men’s league — for the Tulsa Oilers in the Central Hockey League — Ruggiero discussed her trailblazing career, crediting the pioneering 1971-’74 Harvard female student-athletes and others who came before her to pave the road.
During her remarks, Ruggiero also gave thanks to current Harvard women’s hockey head coach Katey Stone, telling attendees that, “Coach Stone taught me a lot about who I am today.”
Since January, Stone has come under fire due to allegations of emotional abuse from former women’s ice hockey players, first reported in a Boston Globe investigation. Following the reports, Harvard launched an external review of the women’s ice hockey program.
Ruggiero offered her appreciation to Stone for instilling a “team-first” mentality in her and her teammates. The remarks received loud applause, including a standing ovation from some Harvard women’s ice hockey alumni and current players.
Ruggiero said Title IX has played a huge role in her life and the world around her.
“I believe sports [are] so important to give people equal access to opportunity because it is this beautiful safe space where you can learn about yourself,” Ruggiero said.
“I learned how to fall down and get back up. I learned grit. I learned how to be an individual on a team,” she continued. “Sports is this beautiful playground where we all get to experiment.”
Ruggiero said she is proud to live in a society where her children have strong female role models to look up to. In closing, Ruggiero responded to those who ask her where she sees Title IX 50 years from now.
“I think we will still need it in 50 years,” she said, pausing. “But for the men.”
The evening concluded with more mingling between generations of Crimson female student-athletes and their supporters. Among them, they had much to celebrate, with 38 national titles, 38 individual titles, 164 Ivy League Titles, and 43 women who have competed for their respective nations in the Olympic or Paralympic Games.
“Power concedes nothing without a demand,” Healey remarked, quoting famous 19th-century abolitionist and orator Frederick Douglas, who Healey said was often quoted by her former coach and Harvard legend, Kathy Delaney-Smith.
While the women of Harvard Athletics have long endured the fight for equality of opportunity, this weekend, they had every reason to celebrate the victories won and glass ceilings shattered. The 10,000 men of Harvard have a long history of competitive excellence, but it is the remarkable women in Crimson who Harvard Athletics is celebrating in this 50th year of Title IX.

Welcome to Harvard Class of 2027! Although I did not have an ~in-person~ Visitas, I imagine it’s the same packed schedule of back-to-back information sessions and clubs trying to bribe you to join them with too-good-to-be-true Patagonias or trips to Europe. When you start falling asleep at your fifth random consulting club information session, here’s what you should do that’s not in the ~scheduled programming~ during Visitas weekend.
Take a stance in the Felipe’s vs Jefe’s debate
Harvard students will debate about which Mexican restaurant is better for hours, and friendships *will* be broken over these conversations. So it is your duty as an incoming Harvard student to explore Harvard Square by trying out everyone’s favorite taquerias. Since Jefe’s recent relocation, the competitors are right across the street from each other making it even more convenient for you to make pros and cons lists for each of them. But be warned: whichever place you favor absolutely defines you, and the rest of your ~transformative~ Harvard experience.
Explore Tasty Basty
The center of the freshman social scene. Grab a burger, or “dance” in a crowded basement — the choice is truly yours. Tasty Burger will be there for you at your highest highs and for your lowest lows during your first 12 months at an ~Ivy League~ institution. You’d be surprised how much time you’re going to spend in the basement of a burger chain joint.
Get over your fear of the MBTA
Learning how to navigate the T your first weekend in Cambridge will make you an unstoppable force of nature within the Harvard community. And maybe visit Boston while you’re at it too! ~Escape the Harvard bubble.~
Take a walk by the Charles River & romanticize your next four years
Main character vibes, what more do I need to say? Bonus points if you get a picture with your Visitas friend group by the sunset.
Break the Quad stigma
After your glamorous walk by the River, start getting used to the idea of the Quad! Find the best things about it while you don’t have classes to rush to yet. It’ll make your housing day ~scaries~ nonexistent in the future.
Visit Trader Joe’s 
I’m not just saying this because TJ’s is ingrained in Flyby culture, but you must visit the Trader Joe’s in Allston! When you want to quite literally *spice up* your meals or escape CVS’s climbing prices, this place will be your holy grail. As someone who overlooked TJs before coming to Harvard, not going earlier was the biggest mistake in my life.
Try to find Remy
Remy the cat is a local celebrity here. Everyone loves him and acts as paparazzi when he’s around. Jump on the bandwagon and grab a selfie with this campus icon! Rumor has it he lurks around the Barker Center…
Go to Lamont basement, then go to the 10th floor of the Smith Campus Center 
Lamont will reveal Harvard’s gloomiest atmosphere, and if you can face that you can face anything. Then to get your spirits up after exposing yourself to the true darkness within Harvard, visit Smith for a breathtaking view and mellow music that will convince you everything will be okay. <3
Start the Harvard traditions early
Do a quick Google search and proceed at your own risk.
Nonetheless these are just a handful of suggestions, and I hope whatever you choose to do with your weekend will be memorable and amazing. <3

As real spring weather is beginning to trickle into Cambridge, our lovely new prefrosh are as well! With Visitas approaching and time cracking down to make a college decision, it's important that your first impression of campus is the best that it can possibly be. Here are six tips to help you make the most of your Visitas experience!
Don’t Come in with a Packed Schedule (the website is a suggestion)
Yes, we know that you’re looking at the Visitas schedule, overwhelmed looking at how you’re going to be able to fit in an extracurricular fair, comedy show, and a jogging tour of campus all at once. But a quick piece of advice: Don’t! While it is good to have an idea of what you would like to do during your time visiting campus, it is much more worthwhile to come in with an open mind. Being lenient allows for spontaneity, which you will appreciate when trying to make plans with your new friends! Walk by the river, or even grab boba! (Seriously though there’s like five boba places in the square now)
Know what different entryways mean (if you are in an upperclassman dorm!)
This might be a personal one, but I think that everyone should learn from my experience. As someone who was hosted in Pfoho as a prefrosh, without even knowing what the Quad was, it was definitely a feat navigating to and from the yard (not to mention I didn’t even have swipe access into the building). Anywho, PLEASE pay attention to what entryway your host is in. There will be multiple dorms of the same number. Don’t knock on the wrong one — if the red lanyard isn’t enough to point you out among the other students, this definitely will be.
Be Genuine!
Lets face it, you are all incredible. You all got into Harvard, you’ve definitely got something under your belt that makes you incredibly unique and interesting among the rest. Key word is all. Don’t spend your time at Visitas flaunting how you’re still deciding between multiple Ivies or that you’re leaving early for Bulldog Days — nobody is asking nor does anyone care. The people that you are meeting are the ones that you will potentially spend the next four years of your life with, have fun and try to be yourself. There will be networking opportunities in the future, you have time to showcase your personality a little during this weekend.
Take Advantage of the Free Stuff
Okay, so I know that I mentioned the extracurricular fair earlier and said not to stress about making every event, but that is genuinely something that you should go to. The merch there? Like no other. There were bucket hats, drawstring bags, stickers, free coffee coupons, and even chewable coffee. (I still have these in my drawer at home, lowkey am too scared to try them.) Other events on the schedule will have free boba or other treats, and even the Harvard Shop had a little goodie bag for us to grab. You need to start your Harvard merch (and coffee?) collection somehow, this is obviously a wonderful place to start.
Remember a Blanket/Pillow/Sleeping Bag
Look, again maybe this was just a personal thing, but I didn’t realize that in being hosted we would literally be on someone’s floor. You’re going to be tired from walking all day, navigating a campus that you’re unfamiliar with and introducing yourself to a trillion new people. The last thing that you’re going to want is to have skin-to-floor contact with someone’s carpet that's overdue for a vacuum. It’s the core of midterms season, you can’t blame your hosts for their messes. Save yourself the trouble and make sure to come prepared!
Make Dean Khurana’s Instagram
This might not exactly make sense to you as a prefrosh now, but trust us. Soon it will.
This list of pointers could truly go on and on, but at the end of the day only one thing really matters: You! Visitas will only be what you make of it, so we hope that you take the opportunity to explore your new possible home with open arms. Congratulations, and we cannot wait to see you (and your red lanyards) on campus soon!

Ready to visit and witness firsthand the transformative experience Harvard can offer but unsure of where to start? Worry not; fitting in is as easy as downloading these five apps on your phone.
GroupMe
If you’re not already juggling 10 different GroupMe chats, then you’re behind. Bring out the overachiever in you and start joining those group chats like your social life depends on it (because, let’s face it, it probably does).
Passio GO!
The true Harvard experience is whining about a 20-minute walk, so much so that this app was born. Harvard’s shuttle tracking app will save your calves if you decide to be adventurous and embark on a pilgrimage to the SEC or Quad. Perhaps you can go see for yourself if the Quad renaissance did, in fact, happen. Plus figuring out how to use the app will be an ego boost.
Uber/Lyft
If you fail to figure out the Passio GO! app, you will have no other options but to walk (eww) or order a rideshare. Rides can be pricey, so it is best to have both to compare prices. If you also have a fear of getting lost on the T, this is the best option to go explore more of the Boston area. The shuttles also don’t run through the night, so save yourself the trouble of downloading both these apps instead of desperately downloading at 2 a.m.
LinkedIn
The only way to reach 500+ connections is to start early, and Visitas is the perfect timing. Network with everyone who knows the next Zuckerberg could be in a sleeping bag sharing floor space with you. You can even become the next LinkedIn influencer and constantly annoy all your connections with essay-long posts.
Gmail
The perfect app to pretend you are busy while waiting for someone. Not only can you give off the impression that you're a busy and important person, but you can also be ~productive~ and finally respond to that email you’ve been avoiding for weeks. And if that wasn’t enough to make you want to download this app, you can also sign up for Harvard Today — dare I say, the funniest and most informative daily newsletter out there. Who needs to actually attend Harvard when you can stay up-to-date with everything happening here from the comfort of your own phone?
On a more serious note, I hope you have a great time visiting Harvard, and remember that whatever decision you make, you should be proud of yourself for all that you've accomplished.

A view from the eighth-floor deck below the observatory showcases stunning views of the campus and the Boston skyline beyond it. It is also a chance to sight stars to find with the telescope later.
A custom-made spherical structure holding a chair found on the deck is used to visualize rotation of a celestial body.
A weather vane on the deck stands completely still beneath the stars. The STAHR observatory is only opened when wind speeds are less than 25 miles per hour.
A plaque at the base of the telescope describes the place and year of its manufacture. Donated by Walter Michael in 1976, the telescope is the centerpiece of the observatory.
The telescope is directed towards a vertical opening in the dome. An older, 10-inch refracting model, the telescope works by using several lenses to funnel and focus light into the eyepiece. The 150-inch-long focal length allows the telescope to magnify more than 300 times, rendering enough detail to see the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, some 400 million miles away.
Artwork from generations of students in STAHR adorns the walls and rim of the dome. Other pieces, like a student-designed wooden chair and ladder, move along the dome to assist students in adjusting the telescope.
The slow, motorized opening of the dome reveals the night sky, decorated with stars.
The telescope is carefully moved into position. Following recent repairs due to water damage, several additional precautions are taken while maneuvering the telescope.
With the dome opened and the telescope prepared, we direct the lens toward the moon. The image in the eyepiece is controlled by a focus knob. Careful manipulation of the telescope reveals a close-up image of the moon.
