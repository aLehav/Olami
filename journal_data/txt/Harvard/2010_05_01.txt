After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Hasty Pudding Club, the Chabad House at Harvard, and the Bee Club have all made bids for the property at 45 Dunster Street, which is currently owned by the Fly Club and leased to the Bee—but a decision on who will lay claim to the space has yet to be made.
The Fly Club’s graduate board met today morning to consider the offers but has not yet reached a decision, according to John L. Powers ’70, the board's president.
“Today was just to assess where we are because a lot of this has happened recently,” Powers said. “And I think that we just need to understand, evaluate all the offers, and have as many people as we can to do it.”
Powers—who would not confirm that the Hasty Pudding, Chabad, and the Bee were the only three bidders—said that the decision-making process is unusually lengthy because the choice will undoubtedly have “an impact on some group at Harvard, if not more than one group.”
“We have a fiduciary obligation to the Fly Club to make sure that whatever the disposition is, we get the best outcome possible for the Fly. But we also understand that the considerations are not purely financial, and that’s what makes this different,” Powers said. “If we were selling a piece of property in Kansas, it’s a little different.”
Powers said he does not know when a decision will be reached. Beyond determining the future occupant of the space, the board has not yet decided on its other options, including whether the Fly should retain ownership of the property or sell it outright.
Although “expressions of interest” in the building have been communicated to the Fly for years, the Bee’s termination of the lease initiated serious conversation among Fly graduate board members about the future of 45 Dunster Street, according to Powers.
High-end men’s apparel boutique J.Press also leases space in that building.
Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish center, has offered $6 million for the space, more than double the City of Cambridge’s assessed valuation of $2.7 million.
Powers did not disclose the value of the other bids, but e-mails obtained by The Crimson have demonstrated an active lobbying effort on the part of the Bee and the Hasty Pudding Club, both of which are on-campus social organizations. Bee members have been soliciting donations from other final club members, while Hasty Pudding alumni have been asked to contact Fly graduate board members to garner support.
Upon its merger with the now-defunct D.U. Club in 1996, the Fly took ownership of the Dunster Street building, which former D.U. member and current Fly graduate board member Charles J. Egan Jr. '54 said was famous for having “the nicest garden area" in Harvard Square. The Fly operates out of their building at 2 Holyoke Street near Lowell House.
Powers, a former Crimson sports editor, said that the graduate board recognizes the importance of the decision, which he called a “sensitive issue on campus,” a sentiment echoed by fellow graduate board member Charles D. Atkinson III ’58.
“I assure you that the Fly Club is taking this very, very seriously, and that we’re going to do the right thing,” Atkinson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weekend after weekend, split after split, I’ve harped the Harvard baseball team’s need to do better than 2-2 if it wants to make it to the Ivy League Championship series. This still holds true, but despite trudging through the Ancient Eight schedule with its consistently inconsistent brand of play, the Crimson still has a chance to win the Rolfe Division.
This weekend Harvard faces division leader Dartmouth in the two teams’ annual home and away series, and while the Crimson sits three games behind the Big Green and one behind second-place Brown, the boys from Cambridge aren’t down for the count just yet. If Harvard sweeps Dartmouth and Brown goes 2-2 or worse, the Crimson will emerge as one of the most unlikely dark horse division champions in recent history.
Of course, those are all huge ifs. It’s impossible to tell which Harvard team will show up on a given day: the dominant, well-rounded squad that shut out Brown, 9-0, last weekend or the Little League imposter that took a 24-1 beating from Columbia a few weeks back. It seems to be one or the other with the Crimson these days, and while it’s possible that good Harvard shows up against Dartmouth, it’s more likely that both Jekyll and Hyde come to the party.
Not to mention that the Big Green is in first place for a reason. Dartmouth pounds the ball so hard throughout its lineup that it has one dude named Brett Gardner (no relation to the light hitting, lightning-quick Yankee center fielder) who is fifth in the Ivies with eight home runs but doesn’t even have enough at-bats to qualify for a batting title. The Big Green also has some nice arms on its staff, including super reliever Cole Sulser, who’s managed to rack up 41 2/3 innings, a 6-0 record, and 45 strikeouts this season. Even if Harvard plays at its best this weekend, it still might not be as good as Dartmouth.
Of course, anything is possible, and the Crimson could pull off the sweep. But it will still need Brown to lose...a lot. That’s also unlikely, considering the Bears have last-place Yale on their plate.
I hate to be bleak, but there aren’t too many scenarios that end with Harvard playing for an Ivy League title. Maybe I’ll go online Sunday night and find out that I’m totally wrong, but in all likelihood, I’d advise Crimson baseball fans to take solace in the old Brooklyn Dodgers’ mantra: Wait ‘til next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you ask me, the top three American landmarks, in no particular order, are the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, and…Fenway Park. Few people ever get the opportunity to experience the Green Monster in person. I am now one of those lucky few, as I was on-hand for MLB’s national Jackie Robinson Day on April 16.
The Red Sox played the Devil Rays and I was a part of the pre-game ceremony, so they actually let me stand on the field. It was cold and drizzling rain, but that meant nothing to me.  I was standing on the left-field foul line right next to Joaquin Benoit and Evan Longoria as they warmed up—I could have died and gone to heaven right at that moment.
After I stopped gawking at them—professional athletes are pure Amazons—it was time for the pre-game events. The young lady who sang the national anthem did a fine job… well, except for the part where she forgot the words. 40,000 people then shouted, “At the twilight’s last gleaming!” Priceless.
Then it was my turn.  Praying I didn’t forget how to throw a baseball, I walked onto the mound and threw out the first pitch.  The crowd went wild cheering for me, and I took a second to let it all sink in.  I was standing on the mound that Josh Beckett would be pitching from in a few minutes’ time.  Insert dying and going to heaven here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They’ve played in Wimbledon, Flushing Meadows, Roland Garros, and in Melboune, and today, they played at Harvard University.   With a combined 18 Grand Slam titles, tennis legends Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe appeared at the Staples Champion Cup Pro-Am yesterday at the Murr Center.
The Pro-Am is hosted annually to raise money for Tenacity, a program that aids at-risk Boston youth by teaching life skills through involvement with tennis. According to tournament organizer and four-time Grand Slam champion Jim Courier, the tournament and accompanying dinner will raise “in the $100,000 range” for Tenacity. Courier founded the tournament in 2005.
Borg, McEnroe, and six other pros teamed up with about 36 amateurs to play doubles in a buzzing spectator event. The pros include Courier, seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Mats Wilander, 2003 Wimbledon finalist Mark Philippoussis, 1986 French Open runner-up Mikael Pernfors, 1983 Italian Open winner Jimmy Arias, and 1992 Olympic silver medalist Wayne Ferreira. Members of the Harvard’s men’s team joined in the contest as well.  In fact, Borg played with Harvard junior No. 1 Alexei Chijoff-Evans on Thursday for about 45 minutes.
“We had a good practice, and he has a lot of potential to be really good,” Borg said. “It’s really up to him how much effort and time he wants to put into tennis, but he has definite potential to be a good player.”
McEnroe also faced Harvard athletes, at one point succumbing to hard-serving freshman Christo Schultz, who aced the tennis hero.
“I like them to challenge me,” McEnroe said. “Hopefully I can show them a little something.”
For all those dreaming of one day wearing a Harvard tennis uniform, or even playing on the pro circuit, Borg offered some words of advice:
“You have to put a lot of effort into tennis and it takes a lot of time,” Borg said. “But the most important thing is it has to come from your heart. You have to enjoy what you’re doing.”

Still have $130 left to use on your BoardPlus before it expires on May 22?  No worries, we’ve got your back on just how to spend that rediscovered cash. Earlier this week, we recommended Rock Café and the Cronkhite Dining Room.  We conclude this feature with Chauhaus.
BoardPlus Redemption Center: Chauhaus, Harvard Graduate School of Design
Hours: Monday-Thursday, 8:00  a.m.-7:00 p.m. and Friday, 8:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. Closed weekends and  holidays.
Ambiance: Chauhaus is nestled  within the Design School’s concrete fortress. With high ceilings,  large windows, and the creative artwork one might associate with the  GSD, Chauhaus seems like it has the potential to be a welcoming, open  space. Unfortunately, it may be too welcoming as the space seemed filled   and cramped with very little room to navigate to a seat and few open  tables. While during off-peak hours Chauhaus may be better, it didn’t  feel like the ideal place to eat or study unless you don’t need to  plug-in and you enjoy a loud murmur in the background.
Food:  Much like The  Rock Café, Chauhaus offers  a typical selection of grill items and sandwiches along with soups and  full salad bar. Drinks include juices, Starbucks Coffee, and fancier  espresso-based concoctions. The Greenhouse may be the gold standard  in selection amongst BoardPlus-accepting restaurants, but Chauhaus still   offers a pretty broad subset of the Greenhouse’s menu.
The Final Word: If you’re  in CGIS and you realize their café doesn’t accept BoardPlus, Chauhaus  offers a convenient alternative, especially if you plan to eat your  food elsewhere.

The Food Literacy Project has cooked up various ideas to help students make the most of humdrum HUDS food.  At Kirkland, the servery now features a list of recipes (which include only ingredients available in the dining hall) designed by participants of the Kirkland  House Top Chef competition—which is part of a larger FLP initiative—last Thursday.
"It  can show students that they can make really incredible  masterpieces  with just the food served every day," said Cassandra B.  Snow '10,  the Kirkland FLP representative.
Black  bean dip with pita chips, chicken wrap stuffed with peanut soy  sauce…those are just some of what students will be able to churn  out using only ingredients available in the servery.
"HUDS  has a fantastic [variety] of ingredients available for  students,"  said Robert B. Schaaf '11, a participant of the competition.  "And  if you know what to do with them then you can make  delicious dishes."
The winning recipes were chosen by four judges, who—while chewing  and  nodding—graded the dishes in terms of creativity, taste, and presentation on a scale of one to five. Erin  E. Walczewski and Luke Walczewski, both tutors in Kirkland  House, were ultimately  crowned "the top chef."
"Winning  is a little awesome," said Erin Walczewski, who  laughed,  kissed her husband, and danced in the dining hall after  hearing the competition results .
Transforming a Bruschetta into an entrée by adding marinated chicken  breast and  finely chopped capicola, the Walczewskis said that they had  not decided  to participate in the competition until that morning. This Wednesday, they will participate in an Iron Chef Harvard competition at Annenberg, which will include Top Chefs from other Houses.
"Oh  I love this competition. I mean look at that. The morale of the  students.  Everybody is kind of working together," said John A. Rohanna,  customer  service manager of the Eliot and Kirkland Dining Services. "It's just a  lot  of energy going in here you know. They all look like young  professionals,  running through, grabbing this, grabbing that."
