After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since 2019, when food delivery apps began to appear en masse in the App Store, there has been a 168 percent increase in downloads, indicating a dramatic shift in consumer behavior towards ordering through web based third-party services. Now, several Harvard-based apps, like Toppings, are looking to break into the field. The basic premise of these apps is simple: They collect menus and prices across a wide range of restaurants and present them to the user in a simple and easy-to-understand interface. Instead of searching across different websites and figuring out which restaurants offer delivery, consumers can now easily access apps that collectivize and simplify this information.
Convenience and ease for the consumer are at the forefront of these designs, as they cater to those looking for late-night food after going out or a lazy weeknight dinner. Orders are placed without any direct contact with the restaurants themselves, removing any human interaction from the process. The apps also often involve thinner profit margins for participating restaurants. In this way, the app and its delivery army act as a profit-hungry middleman, and for the average college student, this supposed time saver turns out to be pretty uneconomical and unsustainable.
These apps have delivery and service fees that quickly jack up prices. From order size fees to proximity fees, unrelated to the drivers’ pay, the customer finds themselves paying for much more than the cost of a meal from their favorite restaurants. In addition to these fees, tips are tacked onto the end of the ordering process, further inflating the cost of each delivery, with tip culture severely emphasized to the user. Doordash, a prominent food delivery service, indicates that “The only times that warrant a tip below 10% are situations that need to be escalated to DoorDash customer service,” forcing tip culture within the apps from a customary gesture to an essential part of the experience.
With the combination of fees, charges, and tips, the average price can increase significantly, turning a reasonably priced meal into an expensive and unsustainable late-night habit.
Toppings, an app founded and run by Harvard students, is a part of a new and expanded ecosystem of apps popping up in the food app industry that demonstrate a shift to utilize consumers themselves in lieu of paying delivery drivers. Toppings markets itself to college students as being able to provide users with free food if they order to get food with other people. What this means from a logistical perspective is that instead of paying delivery drivers, Toppings utilizes common ordering trends among users to cut costs and increase profit while at the same time offering perks and benefits that have them coming back to order more.
Food delivery apps rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, allowing people to get tastes of their favorite restaurants in a time where going inside to eat was beyond imagination. Customers were more likely to overlook fees and taxes for a reminder of the comforts of a pre-pandemic world. Food is so central and important to human connection that it’s no surprise that customers wanted to regain even a bit of this during isolation. However, as society slowly but surely creeps back to pre-pandemic life, the prominence of these apps occupies a precarious spot.
As small businesses and restaurants have been allowed to return to serving people in person, the deep and lasting connection that comes with food and the institutions that provide it returns as well. Food apps disconnect restaurants and the people within them from the customer’s experience, entirely changing the very fabric that lies beneath the culinary world. Environment, staff, cooks, and servers are central to restaurants and the relationship they have with their customers. When the connection to patrons is severed through these apps, so goes the soul of the restaurant itself.
When food apps are the main form of interaction for customers, they derive an essence of a restaurant that is clouded by price gouging, fees, not to mention the time component of delivery. Of course there are factors that make these apps the only way to get beloved restaurant meals for certain customers, like students without cars or ways to access these restaurants otherwise. It isn’t surprising then that the largest group of people using these food delivery apps is young people, ages 18 to 29. This is furthermore concerning, showing that the primary group of people that are suffering this tainted view of culinary institutions is young people who are the next generation of restaurateurs and customers.
These apps can both be the lifeline of restaurants connecting certain customers to their food and, at the same time, the very thing threatening the soul of a restaurant itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under threatening storm clouds on the evening of April 16, an anxious crowd of New Englanders lined up outside the Paradise Rock Club to see English singer-songwriter Tom Odell perform the North American leg of his “Monsters” Tour. The following few hours would be consumed in a musical storm of passionately articulated healing amidst raw heartbreak.
Even though Odell didn’t take the stage until 9 p.m., the ambience in the club was lively and jovial. Minnesotan singer-songwriter Ber came out as Odell’s opener around 8 p.m., jogging onstage and casually calling out, “What’s up, Coachella?”
This lighthearted air continued throughout Ber’s performance; at one point, while recounting the backstory of a song, she said, “One time I dated a Boston guy,” and someone from the audience promptly shouted back, “Sorry!” Ber’s vibe seemed to work really well with the crowd, who sang along to some of her choruses and engaged with her jokes. Her girl-and-guitar act was a good precursor to Odell’s boy-and-piano performance. The greatest similarity between the two was the topic central to their music: heartbreak. “We all love Tom — heartbroken and all,” Ber said, met with shrieking cheers. “Anyone else planning on crying tonight?”
Indeed, when Odell took the stage, the singer only lasted two songs before tearing up himself. “You can’t take back a song once it’s been written — that’s the beauty of it,” he said. It became clear that Odell is a songwriter who feels all the emotions he felt when writing a song every time he goes to perform it. An exhausting act, surely, but also an incredibly powerful one.
Odell took time to talk about his journey with his mental health, particularly detailing how he struggled with bouts of apathy in between panic attacks. His willingness to be so vulnerable while in a performance environment was striking — the crowd fell silent as though listening to a close friend talk about their pain. The intimacy of the moment ebbed onward as he finished talking and led into “Numb,” the first song he wrote on the album “Monsters.”
Continuing in the vein of serious discussion, Odell shared his experience of hearing about horrific school shootings happening while he was living on the West Coast. For someone from England, where gun violence is not as prevalent an issue as it is in America (due to there not being a constitutional right to bear arms), hearing about massacre after massacre was deeply frightening. His song “Streets of Heaven” was written in homage to, and from the imagined perspective of the young lives lost to school gun violence. “Another shot, wasted life / Another friend to walk beside,” Odell crooned, an amalgam of grief and anger lodged in his throat. “I know it hurts but wipe your eyes / And we’ll sing until the old men cry.”
But the intimacy that Odell crafted with his audience was not limited to his songs about heartbreak. Rather, it held steady even in his more upbeat, uplifting songs. For instance, the fan favorite “Grow Old with Me” was performed not only by Odell but by the whole crowd, who sang every word as if they were the ones who had penned the lyrics. And when Odell played “Best Day of My Life,” released just two weeks ago, he ended with a flourishing “a ha ha!” chord to lighten the mood.
Maintaining a connection with his crowd seemed of particular importance to Odell. Though he was stationed at his piano for almost the entire act, he did at one point walk around to the other side of the stage, acknowledging the people to whom his back was turned. He jokingly talked about how Billy Joel, legendary “Pianoman” and one of Odell’s self-professed idols, had a piano that turned and went round and round the stage, but “we decided to spend the budget on something else.”
This connection kept the energy high even when Odell dipped back into more melancholy songs, like his cover of Lana Del Rey’s “Video Games.” He talked about how Del Rey was present the first time he ever performed live on TV in the UK, and she spoke reassuring words to him before he took the stage. His rendition of “Video Games” cast a special magic over the crowd; hearing Del Rey’s mesmerizing lyrics voiced in Odell’s signature croon was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
Collaborator Max Clilverd came out to play guitar with Odell on a few songs, including “Heal,” whose arrangement they changed so that it became a slow, enthralling crescendo that ultimately crashed over the crowd in a wave of emotive sound. “Take my mind and take my pain / Like an empty bottle takes the rain / And heal.”

Since her youth, Boston-based singer-songwriter Isabella Farmer has been a roving creative. As one might expect from an aspiring songwriter and musician, she was raised performing in choir recitals. While Farmer also danced and did gymnastics, she knew singing was her calling. “Music was the one thing I never got tired of, ever,” she said in a recent interview with The Harvard Crimson.
In fourth grade, Farmer’s family relocated from Virginia to Bogotá, Colombia, and she got her first acoustic guitar. During this time of great change — living outside the U.S. for the first time in a completely new environment where she didn’t fully know the language — music, as Farmer put it, “became a massive creative outlet.”
She credits a particularly influential music teacher in Colombia for helping imbue her with this spark for music: Mr. Alberto. A lot of music instructors, Farmer finds, lack that kind of “zest for life” when it comes to their jobs, as they simply go through the motions. Mr.Alberto was different. “I could just tell that he loved music so much,” Farmer said.
At the same time, Farmer’s spark also comes from something intensely intrinsic. “I was always so hungry to search for a sound that really inspired me,” she said. Radio songs and trendy sounds were fine enough, but Farmer found her self disappointed with their superficiality. “I would hear it and go — that’s cool, but, what if it was like this?” Farmer said, describing her initial interest in songwriting.
Now, Farmer studies voice and songwriting at Berklee College of Music here in Boston. But, by her own account, she’s still learning how to better her craft. Reading music, for example, stands out as something she’s been working on. “That’s something I still have problems with for my Berklee assignments,” the singer said. Despite this small detail, though, Farmer has managed to develop a thorough method for song-making.
For every song, Farmer begins by writing out the lyrics first. “I am so, so strict on that,” she said. “I love the lyrics to read like poetry on the page.” Ideas and inspiration for these lyrics, meanwhile, can come from really anywhere. “It’s a pretty even mix of personal experience, a bunch of things conflated, and then childhood things,” Farmer said of her process. “I try to create a story in my head.”
Despite her own attention towards lyrics, however, Farmer recognizes that this same sentiment isn’t true for most music-listeners nowadays, who may focus more on a song’s sonic elements. “Especially the first time hearing a song, you're not necessarily drawn in first by the lyrics, you're more listening to the overall vibe,” the singer said.
Consequently, this knowledge informs how she approaches the musicality of her songs. “I write the lyrics first and try to create an atmosphere for those lyrics to live in, with the music,” Farmer said. “I like to have the music support the feeling of the lyrics.”
In order to create this ambiance, and develop her songs’ instrumentation, Farmer has a unique process that involves first putting her guitar into a random tuning so as to avoid sounding like something off the radio. “Once I have something guitar-wise that sounds like the vibe I want lyrically, I’ll just sing over it,” Farmer said. “I always like to sleep on melodies and see if I remember them the next day, because if you remember it, it’s probably a better one.” From then on, it’s just a process of editing and piecing it all together.
Her latest single “Airsick” is made with this process in mind. It all began with a class she took in high school called “Elements of Poetry.” About a year ago, Farmer began to experience writer’s block. And so, the poems she wrote in the class came as a great boon of inspiration for her songwriting. “I just kind of found that poem again and was like, I should run with this,” the singer said. “I took yet another poem that I wrote for that class too and used some of those lines.” From there, Farmer combined all of those lines to ultimately create a story.
As for plans after her graduation from Berklee in 2024, Farmer wants to regain her fluency in Spanish. “I’m gonna do the language thing first and be inspired by new music elsewhere,” she said. “I think that’ll give me a lot of new writing material.
After that, she plans to move into a city — an “up and coming” one, like Austin, Texas — to continue pursuing music. While the industry standard L.A. is still on the table, Farmer is hesitant about that kind of environment. “It’s very superficial. And I know a lot of people say that, but it’s a different level,” Farmer said.
It’s this superficiality and clout-chasing in the industry with which Farmer is unconcerned. Her main goal is simple: “Hopefully, just try to make it as an artist for a little bit,” the singer said. “I know that…there’s different definitions of that. I think that would just mean for me that I’m able to support myself off of music and playing live.”
As for potentially signing with a label, it’s clear that Farmer has reflected a lot on this issue too. She acknowledges, surely, that labels do provide stability, marketing, and connections. But there’s also a certain loss of originality within the artist. “Obviously, it’s a business,” Farmer said. “They want money, they want you to place, they want you to be able to be played on the radio. And radio music is very specific; it’s almost algorithmic.”
In the end, her desire for artist integrity wins out. “I’m not really willing to compromise my lyrics and I am totally fine if I never blow up,” Farmer said. “I like the way that my stuff sounds, and it feels very authentic to me.”
The singer-songwriter’s music can be streamed here.

“There is no progress without sacrifice” — these words, narrated by Otis Williams (Marcus Paul James), capture the very essence of the musical “Ain’t too Proud.”
Following a successful 2019 debut on Broadway, the twelve-time Tony nominated show “Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations” is embarking on its first national tour, running in Boston from April 19 to May 1. Including over 30 songs from the Temptations and the Motown Records catalog, the show depicts the rise of the vocal group The Temptations to stardom and everything they sacrificed along the way. The show’s energetic choreography and masterful musical renditions create a lively depiction of the Temptations, although the fast pacing prevents parts of the plot from reaching its full potential.
With the 2019 Tony for Best Choreography under its belt, “Ain’t Too Proud” carries a high expectation for its dance numbers, and this run does not disappoint. Featuring high-energy sequences and a talented cast able to dance and sing fabulously without missing a beat, the show provides a very enjoyable experience and manages to capture the soul of The Temptations and their songs. The choreography transitions from one moment to another seamlessly and balances well between individual and group moments without overwhelming the audience.
Along with the incredible choreography, it’s the musical arrangements that make the show. “Ain’t Too Proud” starts out with some bangers, immediately drawing the audience in. Iconic Temptations’ hits, including “My Girl” and “Papa Was a Rollin’ Stone,” are adapted brilliantly to fit into the storyline of the show. The musical numbers blend in seamlessly with the dialogue and often help tell the story, an effect achieved by creatively splitting up a song and transitioning in and out of parts of it. The arrangements manage to both emulate the original spirit of the songs and add further layers of meaning by contextualizing the stories of their creation.
However, the pacing of the show leaves something to be desired. The story covers a significant period of time, but most of the time progression is driven by narration, leaving short pockets of action separated by long temporal gaps. While this large time span does allow for a multifaceted view into the different challenges faced by The Temptations, the short amount of time spent on individual moments makes it difficult to form emotional attachments to many of the issues “Ain’t Too Proud” explores.
This is not a problem when it comes to the recurring tensions and sacrifices that come up, such as Otis’s (Marcus Paul James) relationship with his family and the conflicts within the group. On the other hand, other issues seem to come to the forefront briefly and then go away quickly as the show moves on to the next stage, leaving many facets underexplored. Racial complexities are briefly touched on: Martin Luther King Jr.’s death is written in, The Temptations get shot at while trying to perform in the South, and one of The Temptations mentions the irony of there being some who likes to listen to their music but hates who they are. However, there is not much of an attempt to connect these pieces — instead they exist as isolated moments. Gambling, drugs, and alcohol are also in the periphery, mostly mentioned when they affect the group dynamic and work schedule rather than the continuous struggle and toll taken on the individuals on a personal level. Additionally, moments of grief, especially concerning the loss or changing of group members, pass too quickly, sometimes leaving the audience little time to feel the weight of the loss.
Furthermore, at times the story feels overnarrated and could benefit from more acted out parts rather than verbal explanations, particularly in the first half.
At its heart, “Ain’t Too Proud” is a depiction of the sacrifices necessary to achieve success. The show manages to convey its message while also telling a detailed story of The Temptations’ rise to fame and showcasing many of their top hits. Whether already a Temptations fan or not, the story of their rise from the streets of Detroit to becoming one of the greatest R&B groups of all time will have everyone rooting for them, making the show enjoyable for all.

Isabel Cañas’s debut horror novel, “The Hacienda,” explores more than just fear. The book follows Beatriz, a mestiza woman, and her fight to survive the haunted hacienda she has recently been charged with. In it, Cañas delivers a chilling and compelling story that melds a childhood fear of the dark with the impacts of colonialism and Catholicism in Mexico after the War of Independence.
After the death of her father, a general in the war, Beatriz and her mother are forced to live off the charity of a distant relative, smiling in high society with the men who killed her father for his allegiance to the ousted emperor. When Rodolfo Solórzano, a wealthy military man associated with the newly-created Provisional Government, takes an interest in Beatriz at a ball, she jumps at the chance to marry him despite her mother’s protests. Beatriz quickly realizes, however, that she is being watched, and the house she thought would save her might just kill her. To survive, she enlists the help of the only priest who will listen to her, Padre Andrés, but he, too, harbors dangerous secrets.
The forbidden romance that grows between Beatriz and Andrés begins quickly without falling into the trap of insta-love. Cañas starts it off as a crush, manifesting in Andrés’s warm acquiescence to Beatriz’s plea for help despite his need to keep his identity as a witch hidden from the other priests. Cañas then builds Beatriz and Andrés’s attraction into something sturdy and well-balanced through their moments facing the house’s horrors together.
Cañas’s storytelling can be described as thoughtful and deliberate, complimented by prose that can either pack a punch or soothe an ache depending on the scene’s needs. While the identity of one of the novel’s villains is almost too obvious early in the work, Cañas elevates the stakes each time the reader gets closer to the on-page reveal, leaving readers on the edge of their seats, frantically flipping pages for the entire novel. Cañas’s work is also well-informed on the realities of life in Mexico in the post-war period without being pedantic or burdening the novel with too much detail, an impressive feat for a historian-turned-novelist.
Cañas’s biggest accomplishment, however, is her thorough examination of the specter of colonialism in Mexico. Everyone — from the main characters struggling with their mixed status in the racial casta system, to the hacienda’s staff, to the physical house itself — is caught up in the same daunting web of colonial power relations. Andrés, for example, lives a divided life, trying to balance his belief in God, his grandmother’s witch practices, and a dark power that is entirely his own in the aftermath of the Inquisition. Cañas ensures the speculative and historical elements in the book intertwine to make the setting — rural Mexico in the wake of the War of Independence — a living, breathing character. The night, the wind, and the animals surrounding the hacienda are personified with wills of their own that sometimes align with Andrés’s needs and at other times conflict to add to his turmoil. Perhaps most impressively, Cañas not only makes the trope of the haunted house a character, but a character with an arc that the reader slowly begins to sympathize with as they realize that the house may also have been changed by colonial unrest.
Ultimately, Cañas delivers an ending that respects the needs of the characters and the house, wrapping up the story’s loose ends with care and kindly leaving a few strands open for the more romantic readers. It is quietly hopeful — a satisfying tone to end on for what is otherwise a tense and electrifying story — and marks her as a serious writer to watch.

Readers of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jennifer Egan gathered at the Brattle Theater on Friday, April 8, for an hour-long event featuring a reading and Q&A from the author’s latest novel, “The Candy House.” The new novel touches on themes of technology and memory and features a software called “Own Your Unconscious,” which grants its users access to their repressed or forgotten memories.
Before reading an excerpt from another of her novels, “A Journey/A Stranger Comes to Town,” Egan discussed some creeds of her writing process — the author strives toward ten handwritten pages of new material every day, no matter what. Egan also touted dreams as a source of inspiration. She draws heavily from their details, which she writes down before she can forget. “When we sleep at night, we are all fiction writers,” she said.
Egan further stressed the influence of her subconscious on her writing, citing examples of linkages between names of characters and titles of chapters that appeared in her work without her overt intention. These examples fed into a later point Egan made concerning her strategy of “telling the story inadvertently,” a device that, much like the “Black Mirror”-esque technology of “The Candy House,” employs the subconscious in order to create a story.
During the Q&A segment following the reading, many avid readers professed their admiration for Egan’s innovative fiction. One reader thanked Egan on behalf of their neurodivergent child for her respectful portrayal of neurodivergence in her 2011 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “A Visit from the Goon Squad.”
In response to a question about her writing life, Egan spoke at length about her writing circle, to which she credits much of her development and improvement as a writer. The circle began, she said, as a small group of budding writers — eager for feedback and involvement in a literary sphere — hired a more seasoned writer to read and give feedback on their writing. After a time, though, the workshop leader decided she wanted feedback on her own writing as well, and designations of tutor and tutee dissolved. Egan joked about the transition: “We were like, ‘Okay, but we’re not gonna pay you anymore.’”
The reading was sponsored by the Harvard Book Store and celebrated their reintroduction of in-person programming in March after months of virtual events. Marketing Coordinator Audrey Stewart gave a message of gratitude to the audience before the reading began: “Thank you for supporting us and our virtual series in this time of need.”
Following the event, attendees moved to the lobby of the Smith Campus Center for a book signing and a chat with Egan. In line with her copy of Egan’s newest was Jessica Keener, a fellow novelist and friend of Egan’s. Keener has penned two short story collections and, most recently, the 2017 novel “Strangers in Budapest.” Keener specifically lauded the amplitude and range of Egan’s writing, as well as Egan’s ability to exercise radical compassion using fiction as her medium. She also expressed her appreciation for Egan’s ritualistic approach to the craft of creative writing: “Editing is like shaping clay, but writing a first draft is like making the clay out of thin air,” she said. “It’s a kind of magic.”

After five long years, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar is back and has announced plans to drop new music. His fifth studio album, “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,” is scheduled to release on May 13. Lamar posted the announcement through his new multi-disciplinary media company pgLang. The project will be Lamar’s final album under his contract with West Coast Powerhouse TDE, preceding the rapper’s complete transition to the pgLang banner. Founded by Lamar and Dave Free in 2020, pgLang emphasizes using different art forms to tell stories, ranging from music to film to books. This idea is extremely captivating when considering that Lamar himself, can’t be defined as simply a rapper or musician, but a multifaceted artist. This interdisciplinary creative identity can be seen in the ways Lamar’s existing studio albums utilize different art forms to forward a more complex form of storytelling.
“Section.80”: A Collection of Short Stories
Lamar’s first album gave listeners a motivated and raw version of the budding star. He was far from the mainstream artist he is today, but his captivating storytelling and lyrical abilities were clear on tracks like “Ronald Reagan Era” and “Rigamortus,” specifically, hears the Compton MC spit a tongue-twisting, nearly-minute-long verse — seemingly without taking a single breath. The album as a whole is especially compelling, feeling like a collection of short stories that tell a broader, loosely connected narrative. This can be seen literally with tracks titled “Chapter 6” and “Chapter 10.” But also in the overall flow of the album when taken as a collective piece of work. There are the recurring characters of Tammy and Keisha, who even have their own tracks dedicated to them, for example. The album as a whole spans a wide variety of topics, from the effects of the crack epidemic to nuances in race, with each track feeling like its own contained narrative house within the larger world of the album.
“Good Kid, m.A.A.d City”: A Short Film
“Good Kid, m.A.A.d City” truly thrust Lamar into the spotlight. Songs like “Swimming Pools(Drank)” and “m.A.A.d city” became some of the biggest hits of 2012, and the album garnering the rapper his first Grammy nomination and what should have been his first win. While “Section.80” is a collection of different stories, “Good Kid, m.A.A.d City” is a tight narrative that tells the story of a single day in the life of a young Kendrick. “Backseat Freestyle,'' for example, calls to mind a young Kendrick freestyling in the back of a car after being picked up. The story isn’t completely chronological. There are some tracks that occur in different places in time, but everything traces back to that singular day. The album crosses the boundaries of just being music and becomes something cinematic. Lamar himself recognizes this, TOO. A description on the album’s cover reads: “a short film by Kendrick Lamar.”
“To Pimp A Butterfly”: The Poet
Three years after “Good Kid, m.A.A.d City,” Lamar returned with 2015’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” and completely shook up the hip-hop world. Sonically, it was a turn away from his earlier works and their more conventional rap sound. “To Pimp A Butterfly,” instead embraced heavy jazz, blues, and hip-hop influences. This fusion of styles led to Lamar’s most critically acclaimed album to date, filled with powerful, introspective tracks speaking upon mental health, morality, and racial inequality. And while “Good kid, m.A.A.d city” felt cinematic, “To Pimp A Butterfly” seems more poetic in nature. Throughout the album Kendrick slowly unveils a poem in some of the outros and intros of tracks, giving longer and longer snippets and finally culminating in the final track “Mortal Man,” where listeners finally get the full poem. The standout is in its finale, where Lamar elaborates upon the title “To Pimp a Butterfly” with an allegory of the caterpillar and butterfly that discusses the physical and mental growth in life. The impact this album has had is immeasurable, and while Lamar was snubbed of the “Album of the Year” award at the Grammys, his messages on “To Pimp a Butterfly” will stay with fans for a long time.
“DAMN.”: A Mélange, A Satire
Lamar’s most recent studio album brought together styles from his previous works. He again embraced the more traditional sounds in hip-hop, but complemented them with themes and sounds first seen in “To Pimp A Butterfly.” This created a clear and thought-provoking thematic experience that earned him the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for music, making him the first rapper to do so. With title names like “FEEL,” “PRIDE,” and “HUMBLE,” Lamar gave a clear view into the relevance of each song. Each track feels like an exaggeration of these themes, giving unique examples of his experiences and thoughts. In his 2018 Grammy performance, Lamar had the words, “This is a satire by Kendrick Lamar” prominently displayed in the background as he performed music from “DAMN.”
And now, fans arrive at “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.” What can we expect from this latest album? So much has changed in the past five years since “DAMN.” was released. And yet, since the release of Lamar’s executive produced compilation album “Black Panther: The Album” in early 2018, little has been heard of him. His most recent musical appearance was on Baby Keem’s 2021 album “The Melodic Album,” where he featured on “range brothers” and “family ties,” with the latter earning the pair a Grammy for “Best Rap Performance.” One thing is for certain, though: Lamar will make sure his new album is a completely new experience.

Student performers and excited audience members gathered in the Lowell Lecture Hall on Saturday, April 16 for the first in-person Asian American Dance Troupe (AADT) performance in three years — “Eastbound.” The group’s highly anticipated return to in-person performances sold out within hours of ticket release and prompted AADT to perform a third show, for the first time in the group’s history. The theater buzzed with energy from both audience members and the dancers as they stretched and finished preparing their dances — or what their captains referred to as “labors of love” in their moving letter in this year’s program.
For Michelle Sun ’25, dancing in this spring’s performance was all about building community. “I think even before coming to Harvard, hearing about AADT and their community made me really want to be a part of it, especially coming in as a really scared Freshman, I was immediately drawn into the community,” she said. “The community is the biggest part of AADT. The people here are really sweet, really amazing and really supportive, like even if you don’t particularly know them, they’re always going to be there to like, you know, help out or give a lending hand. It’s just really fun, a really bubbly, supportive community.”
Sun anticipates participating in AADT for many years to come. “I was welcomed with open arms, and that’s the start of my AADT journey and I know it’s going to be really far out into the future up until my last semester in Senior year,” she said.
Many audience members took time out of their Saturdays to support friends performing in the show. “Our friend Stephanie is performing and I am here to support her. Just to check it out. I have never been to anything like this, so I am curious to see what it is like,” said Anuraag V. V. Gopaluni, a third-year graduate student in the department of Biostatistics.
“I’m here because one of my friends is participating and performing. We are both from the school of public health, which is a little bit far from where we are at the moment. And, I really respect the way he has tried to incorporate creativity into his day to day life,” said Krithi Ravi, a first-year School of Public Health student who was waiting for a last-minute ticket for the sold-out 2 p.m. show.
Others attended AADT’s “Horizons” show in fall 2021 and were so impressed with the performance that they became hooked on AADT. “We went to the one in the fall and it was just really fun to watch and we had a great time. You could tell the performers were having a great time too, and we wanted to support our friends as well. It was really hype,” Joyce Wu ’24 said.
Claire Huang ’24 agreed. “We came in the fall, and it was honestly a really inspiring performance and you can really see all the hard work they put in and we’re excited just to watch it. I expect to have a lot of fun again,” she said.
For Wu, AADT’s reach goes beyond just one performance. “Harvard is really special that they have AADT and a group like this just because I feel like a lot of other schools don’t. It’s such a specialized group. There’s such a passion that they put forward, and they really do make a big impact on this campus,” she said.
By intermission, the crowd was electric with excitement, cheering for each dance and shouting out the talented performers. “I thought the show was great, a lot of fun,” said Jessica H. Sun, a third-year graduate student at SEAS in the department of Physics. “I’ve been to a couple of these and I was part of MIT’s AADT which is similar to this, so it’s very nostalgic for me. It’s very energetic. I was really impressed by ‘Rule Breakers.’ It was so clean,” she said.
As the cast danced exuberantly for the curtain call, the crowd cheered wildly. The shared, sustained energy of dancers and the audience came to a head with the sexy and colorful “Aphrodisia” dance routine. A fitting conclusion to a joyous celebration of tradition, creativity, exploration, and freedom that seemed just as fun to perform as it was to watch.
“We’ve been lucky to witness our dancers' many multitudes: kind, hot, brilliant, sensual, zany, diligent, fun,” choreographers Sho Sho Leigha Ho ’24 and Si Chiang Wu ’24 wrote in the program. “Our performance today is the product of a community that has cheered each other along as each individual solidified their confidence in themselves.”

Hamlet returns to his Scandinavian origins as Amleth in director Robert Eggers’s new historical epic “The Northman.” Told through a series of titled vignettes, the film follows the well-known story of Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård) as he struggles to avenge his uncle Fjölnir’s wrongful murder of his father and save his mother Gudrún (Nicole Kidman) from her marriage to Fjölnir. Although replete with all the dark moodiness and savagery one expects from an Eggers film, “The Northman” tragically fails to extract any deep emotional investment from its audience.
Thrumming with Nordic tribal beats and imposing Icelandic landscapes, “The Northman” introduces its audience to the primal, brutal world of the Vikings with effective iciness. Villages are savagely raided, innocents slaughtered, women raped, and children burned in front of the cold-blooded camera’s roving eye, which glides from one barbaric feat to the next with a strange sense of documentary detachedness.
Worldbuilding is usually Eggers’ strong point — previous works like “The Witch” (2015) and “The Lighthouse” (2019) are both testaments to the director’s skill in crafting a consistent tone and mood and in recreating historical landscapes with anthropological accuracy. Compared to these past triumphs, however, “The Northman” feels somewhat lackluster in this regard. Rituals involving hallucinatory drinks and human sacrifices occur frequently and with little to no context in the film, creating a sense of alienation unalloyed with moments of tenderness or intimacy in the narrative. Eggers unflinchingly — almost gleefully — depicts the ferocious nature of Viking culture and of his equally violent characters. But at some point, extreme violence stops being novel and starts becoming tedious. At no point in the film can a viewer empathize with any of the characters on screen, except maybe with Gudrún, whose late-stage confession of marrying Amleth’s uncle to save herself from a loveless marriage with his father is the closest the audience ever gets to witnessing a character’s humanity.
Even the violence in the film feels coquettish at times: The camera always coyly avoids truly outrageous visuals, like a set of mutilated bodies hanging from pikes on a hut or Amleth and his lover Olga’s naked bodies during a love scene. Although certain scenes attest to Eggers’ visionary aesthetics — a terrifying Valkyrie emits a shrill battle-cry and rides into the heavens on her winged horse, and a fully-naked Amleth and Fjölnir swing swords at each other inside of a burning volcano — the visuals in “The Northman” as a whole feel more appropriate to a pseudo-documentary film about Vikings rather than what’s supposed to be an emotionally moving heroic tale.
In fact, “The Northman” feels more like an epic poem accompanied by sound and visuals rather than a true cinematic reimagining of the classic tragedy of Amleth (or Hamlet). The dialogue, spoken with varying vaguely Scandinavian-sounding accents and co-written by Icelandic poet and novelist Sjón, has all the stilted formality of Shakespearean English without the imaginative poetry. The result is a script as cringey to listen to as it is difficult to understand. “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir,” becomes the steadfast mantra both for a young, traumatized Amleth who witnesses his father’s brutal death and for a grown Amleth who disappointingly never evolves from the single-mindedness of his youth.
Skarsgård’s acting is simultaneously stoic and simmering with hidden emotion, but the script unfortunately renders him little more than a ripped and roaring sword-wielder. Anya Taylor-Joy as Olga plays up the wiliness of her witchy character wonderfully, but ultimately remains shallow and unexplored as the script transforms her into a mechanism for Amleth’s lineage by impregnating her with twins.
Amleth is at heart a story about revenge that’s been told and retold so many times that the narrative has almost become a cliché. But where Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” and other modern adaptations of the tale complicate the hero’s arc or at the very least introduce philosophical questions that raise the story from its literalness, “The Northman” stubbornly (and mistakenly) sticks to the original text as unimaginatively as possible. It’s a surprising move for a director as unconventional and interested in deep psychological inquiry as Eggers. The consequence is a narrative that is as predictable as it is gory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From journalistic snapshots of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to portraits of Syrian refugees’ life jackets afloat in Greek waters, visual representations of the migrant experience are varied in form and content — a lesson the students of Spanish 150: Migration and Border-Crossing in Film and Photography, taught this semester by Professor Raquel Vega-Durán, are quite familiar with. The class’s 16 students have created their own art exhibit on campus distilling broader course themes on borders and exploring diverse migration narratives, on display from April 25 through May 6.
Adorning the walls of Ticknor Lounge on the first floor of Boylston Hall, the exhibit consists of multiple projects. Alongside collages of works highlighting the migrant experience in five distinct mediums — animated films, narrative films, documentary films, children’s literature, and graphic novels — visitors can find selected examples of visual culture with captions written by the students. In addition, each student crafted their own physical representation of a concept pertinent to the exhibit, such as hope, vulnerability, and invisibility, which course head Vega-Durán compiled together into a quilt. The quilt is accompanied by poems selected from a text the students read for the course to expand on their individual concepts.
The exhibit attempts to parse through the perpetual “bombardment of images” we consume regarding migration, according to Vega-Durán, who chairs the Faculty Advisory Committee for Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights (EMR) — a secondary field Harvard offers.
“What is something that we have all the time? We’re exposed to visual culture all the time. I think people take for granted… all the different languages of visual culture,” said Vega-Durán. “You have to understand how to read images.”
While the exhibit was a collaborative effort between every member of the class, students were largely self-guided. Taking inspiration from the works of outside artists selected for the exhibit, which span photography, water color, and sculpture, among other mediums, students used both drawings and digital art to create their quilt squares.
“Everyone has such different ideas, such different experiences, such different visual narratives they want to convey with their specific word,” said Maria V. Kaltchenko ’23, a Romance Languages and Literatures secondary student enrolled in the course. She selected “emigrant/immigrant” as her concept for the quilt.
To further the dialogue at the intersection of visual studies and EMR, Spanish 150 welcomed several guest lecturers to speak about their work with the students, including Mexican-born activist and artist Arleene Correa Valencia, whose work is also featured in the exhibit. Correa Valencia finds art to be a liberating vehicle for discussion.
“The visual arts are a way of communicating without needing to actually have a spoken language or a method of communication that is limiting to certain audiences,” said Correa Valencia in an interview with The Crimson. “And when we bring that into an academic space, it’s a tool for a different perspective, of understanding information from a point of view that is not necessarily traditional in academia or numerical in any way.”
Vega-Durán explained that while the scope of the project was initially limited to migration from Spanish-speaking countries to the U.S., the class realized quickly that the exhibit would benefit from accommodating more global narratives — a choice that reflects the class’s commitment to considering new perspectives. Capturing the migrant experience need not be a limited endeavor: In the words of Correa Valencia, art “has the power to traverse borders.”
While Vega-Durán maintains that the small class size is necessary to promote discussion, she hopes Harvard will continue to expand the EMR curriculum. While many peer institutions likewise haven’t done so, 70 schools across the nation — including Columbia University, the University of Chicago, and Stanford University — have already devoted their resources to entire ethnic studies departments. Promoting EMR at Harvard will require support across academic fields.
“It’s complex to think about: How can you have an interdisciplinary department or concentration in a place where you have divisions?” said Vega-Durán. “My goal is to make EMR interdisciplinary. So not to have five different methodologies and courses and say ‘Okay, I have my secondary.’ But, ‘How are they connected? How are we understanding migration in a global or transnational way?’”
Correa Valencia recounted feeling surprised that there was such an engaged audience for her story at Harvard. Vega-Durán stated that the popularity of the EMR secondary has grown consistently recently — a development beneficial for students and teachers alike.
“I think that’s the really great thing about EMR. You teach, but also you learn from the students and you have that thing that is really fulfilling for everyone,” said Vega-Durán.
As for the students, their goal is to foster a dialogue and encourage others to reflect on their personal relationship to the theme of migration.
“The immigrant experience cannot be homogenized. It is so different for every person. This art shows us basically that there are universal elements that are present in migration that recapitulate what it means to be human,” said Kaltchenko. “All of these parts of the exhibit are in conversation and I think the spectator is part of that conversation.”
Visitors can view the exhibit until May 6 in Boylston Hall, which is located in Harvard Yard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one thinks of Harvard Square, familiar images come to mind: the flagship CVS, red bricks, blaring music, the laughter of college students, and, most notably, countless local businesses. In an area primarily serving college students, the rent for local businesses is quite high, meaning every inch of the square must be utilized for small businesses to remain profitable. Within this bustling, commercial zone of Cambridge, however, there lies a hidden gem: A small place for public art.
A recent initiative sponsored by Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Inc. in collaboration with the Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) and the Cambridge Art Community is promoting the development of community art in the square. About six months ago, Piedmont — a real estate company that owns One Brattle Square — reached out to Denise Jillson, the Executive Director of HSBA, in hopes of figuring out what to do with the deserted shadow box sitting on the property.
In an email interview with The Crimson, Dawn Gideon, the assistant property manager of Piedmont, said, “We were hoping she would have suggestions for filling the shadow box with something that would reflect the spirit of Harvard Square and the culture that surrounds this unique and vibrant community.”
Since HSBA’s mission is to promote commerce in Harvard Square while also serving as an honorable steward of the public space, Jillson had already been working on several initiatives regarding the enhancement of the pedestrian experience when Piedmont reached out. In fact, she had been working with local artists on bringing art to Palmer Street since last summer.
Jillson initially decorated the shadow box herself with simple holiday ornaments in December. However, she eventually met local artist and mother Kyoko Ono through another public arts project in Cambridge and Ono was immediately interested in bringing her artwork to Piedmont’s shadow box.
“I used my pieces as an entryway, but I really wanted to promote art by artists who are not known,” said Ono. “There are opportunities where you can apply and get juried to show in an gallery or enter a grant and so forth, but there are juries, where you are judged… Especially during [the] pandemic, when we were all cooped up but could [still] go out and walk, I thought, wow, this is an opportunity where we can get more art out in[to] the public.”
Ono carefully curated an exhibition featuring her pottery in Piedmont’s shadow box, marking its first use by a local artist. Although the shadow box is a tiny space, it has the potential to be quite significant to the community.“Walking by the shadow box affords the passersby the chance to observe, reflect, and enjoy art created by members of our community. Art provides a chance to step away from politics, the office and assorted problems of the day!” said Gideon.
Ono holds a similar view to the role of art in the world. To her, art is about communication. “As small as this window may be, it's a huge window… for us. It's like a window to connect with the public.”
In line with her initial mission to share the works of unknown artists with the community, Ono has now curated a new exhibition featuring the pottery of students of the Ceramics Program at the Office for the Arts at Harvard. This display is set to be at the shadow box until mid-May, and Ono is currently in the works to find a photographer to take creative control of the next exhibition at Piedmont’s shadow box.
The box joins other informal art projects nearby like the sculpture of a blue elephant named Michelle being displayed across the street from the shadow box in Elliot Triangle. Public art is a growing feature of Harvard Square.
“[You can] look across the street at the beautiful elegance of pottery, and then you come here [to the elephant sculpture], and it's elegance of a different sort,” said Jillson. “There's something for everybody.”

Harvard Track and Field competed near and far this past weekend. The Crimson continued to impress as it has all season with dominant performances at neighboring MIT’s Sean Collier Invitational, Baylor University's Michael Johnson Invitational, and the Virgina Challenge hosted by the University of Virginia. With the Outdoor Ivy League Championships on the horizon, the team posted multiple marks which leave it among the programs best in recent memory.
Despite the trip getting off to a raining start, the sun came out for Harvard to compete at Clyde Hart Track and Field Stadium in Waco, Texas. On the track, the women's 4x100 team of first-years Victoria Bossong and Eden Finkelstein, sophomore Egbe Ndip-Agbor, and junior Tina Martin ran the seventh fastest time in program history at 3:39.83. In the 100 hurdles, senior Jada Jones made her mark among the Crimson’s greats, running the event in 13.38 seconds. Only one Harvard runner has posted a faster time. The men’s side made sure to keep up with the women’s as first year Daniel Falode took third in triple jump, and the 4x400 team recorded the program’s second fastest time ever in 3:09.81. The team was made up of first year Oliver Murcko and sophomores Peter Diebold, Gregory Lapit, and Lance Ward. Ward, along with senior DeMarkes Stradford, also competed in the 100m dash. Stratford’s time of 10.37 places him at second all-time in program history and eighth at the collegiate level this season. This year is Stradford’s first season with the program. The All-Ivy League wide receiver has spent the majority of his time in Cambridge on the football field.
“I just wanted to come out and be able to contribute to the team in general,” responded Stradford when asked about his performance this weekend and the season as a whole. “Being able to reach the successes that I have has been pretty exciting to see and pretty fun to do, especially with my teammates.”
There was no shortage of sunshine for the Crimson back in Cambridge, either. Down the river at MIT, five Harvard athletes took first in their respective events. On the track, sophomore Jada Johnson ran a personal best time of 14.30 while winning the 100m hurdles. In the field junior Chet Ellis won high jump clearing 6’5”, senior DaLoria Boone won the long jump with a jump of 17'8.75", junior Hannah McLaughlin took first in javelin (120’ 11”), and sophomore Meaghan Toscano won discus (139’7”). Toscano also placed second in shot put, while junior teammate Cammy Garabian came in second in the hammer throw.
At Lannigan Field, Harvard junior throwers Sarah Omoregie and Alexander Kolesnikoff made sure their team would be well represented at the Virginia Challenge. Kolesnikoff threw his second best mark of the spring, launching the shot 63'8¼" to take second. Posting a personal best and achieving the second farthest throw in the women’s team’s history, Omoregie placed fourth in shot put (52’10”). The only Harvard shot putter left between Omoregie and the Crimson record is Olympian Nikki Okwelogu '17.
“It definitely comes down to having a great team environment and having a great training,” Omoregie said. “As an athlete, you can get into your head and put a lot of pressure on yourself. And I think for me, after the pandemic, it was more about just having fun and enjoying the process,so I think that's coming out now with my performances.”
Looking ahead, Harvard is set to compete at the Ivy League Heptagonal Outdoor Track and Field Championships in less than two weeks. For the women’s side, a “triple crown” is on the line. The first and only time the Crimson has won all three Heptagonal Championships (cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track) was during the 2016/2017 season. Olympian Gabby Thomas was a sophomore at the time and won three medals at indoor championships, five at outdoors, and was named performer of the meet. The men’s side is hungry for its first Heptagonal Championship of the year after taking second at both the cross country and indoor championships.
“[Winning an Ivy League Championship] would be the ultimate end to my senior career,” Stradford said. “I always have faith in my teammates and faith in myself and faith in our coaches. I believe it's possible as long as we do what we have to do and just go out there,run fast, and hope for the best because you're the only variable which you can control.”
The Crimson has one last tune-up this weekend before heading to New Haven in the pursuit of a championship. Multiple distance runners will compete at the historic Penn Relays, while others are headed to Stanford for the Payton Jordan Invitational.

The Harvard men and women golf teams got ready and headed to New Jersey over the weekend of April 22nd to compete in the first Ivy League Championships for golf since 2019.
The men and women’s teams had challenging matchups leading into the championship game, but both teams ended their season in third place overall.
Before the championship, the women’s team gathered momentum with a stellar performance at the Hoya Invitational at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where the Crimson was able to walk away with a second place finish.
“I definitely think leaving the Hoya Invitational, [we felt] it was our best Ivy finish yet,” senior captain Anina Ku said. “But, I think we all walked away from that, focusing on small things that we still had to improve on.”
“I think for the Ivy League Golf Championship we tried not to have expectations and just tried to focus on things that we can control … so mentally I believe [the Ivies] was one of our best performances,” Ku added.
The championship ended with nearly the same story for the team as they ended Ivies in third place behind first place Princeton and second place Columbia.
“We played well at Ivies. I know we finished third, but we were only eight shots back,” Coach Kevin Rhoads said.
Eight points separated the Crimson’s final to par score of +36 and Princeton’s final to par score of +28. Dartmouth College and Yale tied for fourth with a final score of +38 meaning that the Crimson was just able to edge out those teams with two points to secure a third place finish.
“Overall I think it was indicative of really strong work and really good progress in the right direction,” Kevin Rhoads stated. “They have a lot to be proud of and a lot to build on.”
The men’s team ended up in the same position with a third place finish with +45 total points losing to first place Yale, +35, and Columbia, +40.
“They, [Yale], put up a really good round the first day to be ten shots ahead of us and in the end that ended up being the margin of victory,” Coach Rhoads said.
The men’s team also edged out the fourth place Princeton by a mere two points. two weeks prior to the Ivies the team was 40 points behind Princeton at the Princeton Invitational and finished in 13th place out of 15 teams.
“On the men’s side it was a really strong season as it turned out,” Coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Princeton was concerning to finish forty shots back of Princeton … that was just uncharacteristic of this team for sure.”
Leading up to the Ivy League Championship, Rhoads instilled the motto that the team must focus on what they can control and to not let things that they cannot control weigh them down.
“It is our focus and we have talked about it a great deal,” Kevin Rhoads emphasized. “In the moment what feels controllable sometimes changes, it’s dynamic in the moment, we just have to continue adapting and reacting to it as well as possible.”

The last Ivy League championship was played in 2019, and for some on the team, this 2022 championship was their very first Ivies experience, but for upperclassmen members that played pre-Covid they were able to look at the championship with a different perspective.
“I still have the memories of my freshman year Ivies, I remember every moment of it, basically...“Especially, I remember us coming back from behind to win,” said Ku in reference to the 2019 Ivy League Championships in which the team was able to secure a final total score of +37. Seniors Chloe Royston and Anina Ku were both members of the lineup that took home the trophy.

Moving forward from the team’s third place finishes, the team is ready to regroup and prepare for the next season and next Ivy League Championship.
“We just have to do the work and continue to stay motivated and see if there were any lessons learned that were really controllable and that is what we are really going to focus on,” Rhoads said.
Ku wrapped up with some parting last words of wisdom for the team: “They have to continue having the same mentality next year, which was super patient and mature, and if they are able to combine all of that I think they will have a really good shot at getting the title back,” Ku said.

It has been a long, long 13 weeks, and though it’s bittersweet, we are so glad this spring semester is coming to an end. To close off our semester on a wholesome note, we are recollecting the small acts of kindness, words of encouragement, and other sentiments that helped us get through the spring.
Shout out to:
The girl who shares my love for General Gao’s chicken and waited patiently with me until the HUDS staff kindly brought out a new tray of our favorite chicken nuggets covered in sweet and sour sauce.
The really nice guy in Berg who always says “thank you” and “have a nice meal.”
Pet therapy, need I say more? There is no better feeling than walking past the science plaza tent and seeing the cute goats, ducks, chicks, bunnies, and pigs and having your stress instantly melt away. Thank you to Stuey, Starlight, Meatball, and Tony for being there when we needed it the most.
The new Berg additions. Falafel Fridays, Taco Tuesdays, Sundays Sundaes, and the reopening of the Grill. The variety that we’ve seen in the dhall menu is astounding. Having a nice meal to spice up my life after a really long day in lab, classes, and club meetings really pulled us through the semester.
The two girls who complimented my dress in front of Lamont. Nothing feels better than fellow women’s validation. Thank you for making my day and helping me feel pretty.
Seeing the flowers start to bloom. A beautiful sight for my eyes, a sore sorrow for my nose. Even though I’m sneezing every few seconds, the flowers motivated me as I walked through the yard for another Cabot Library study session.
My semester crush. Thank you for not making a move again this semester. I didn’t want a relationship anyway because of my #commitmentissues. Ahahah. Definitely not crying myself to sleep. (Iykyk)
Thank you Taylor Swift, always, but specifically for releasing “Red” (TV) when I was in the trenches. I will never not sing along to “All Too Well 10 minute version.”
It’s been a challenging semester, but it’s the little things that count. Thank you to everyone and everything that kept us from dropping out every so often. Keep thriving, besties. And as they say in high school, HAGS.
