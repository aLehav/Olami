After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dunster House will be the first full House to be renovated as part of the University’s House Renewal project during the 2014-2015 academic year, Harvard administrators announced on Thursday.
During this time, Dunster House residents will be housed at 1201 Mass. Ave, a University-owned building that currently houses the Inn at Harvard, and three University-owned apartment buildings in the Square.
Dunster will be the third dormitory to be renovated as part of the project, following Quincy House’s Old Quincy, which is currently under construction, and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, which will be renewed in the 2013-2014 school year.
The announcement marks a step in the University’s transition out of the ‘test’ phase of the project—in which individual buildings will be renovated—toward a more ambitious plan to fully renovate all 12 undergraduate Houses, a program that administrators estimate will cost between $1 billion and $1.3 billion.
“It is time to move ahead with plans to renew a full House,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement. “Dunster House is one of the smallest and oldest neo-Georgian river Houses, which makes it the perfect candidate to be first for renewal.”
To prepare 1201 Mass. Ave. to serve as a central hub for students displaced by House Renewal, administrators will close the Inn at Harvard by July 2013 and alter the building to install a dining hall, beds, and social spaces, according to Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. The Inn at Harvard building will serve as swing space, or temporary housing, for all future House renewal projects, Hammonds and Smith said.
Residents of Quincy and Leverett displaced by construction on their Houses live in apartment buildings at Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Ave., and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St. during the 2012-2013 and the 2013-2014 academic year, respectively. These same apartment buildings will house some Dunster residents during the 2014-2015 school year.
Renovations will begin on Dunster in June 2014 and will continue throughout the following academic year, with an eye toward reopening the House at the start of the next school year.
“We’re very pleased that Dunster will be the first full House to be renewed,” Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter said in a statement. “This is an exciting development for all of us who love Dunster and want it to remain a vibrant place for students to live and learn for decades to come.”
During the 2015-2016 academic year, Hammonds and Smith announced, administrators will pause the project to assess their progress before moving on to the renewal of the next House in 2016-2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 66 years, the Harvard men’s basketball team will be one of the clubs featured in ESPN’s College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon on November 13. The Crimson will face Massachusetts at 10 a.m., on the Minutemen’s home court, as part of eleven back-to-back games included in ESPN’s 24 consecutive hours of televised Marathon coverage.
Both Harvard and UMass had strong 2011-2012 seasons. Harvard won its first-ever outright Ivy League title and returned to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946. The Crimson finished the year with a 26-5 (12-2 Ivy) record and reached the Tournament’s Round of 64.  UMass, which went 25-12 (9-7 Atlantic 10) last season, reached the National Invitation Tournament’s Final Four.
The Crimson and Minutemen have met 24 times previously; but, it has been more than two decades since the two schools faced off. In their last meeting, during the 1991-1992 season, UMass was victorious, 98-63, taking a 14-10 lead in the all-time series.
The two schools, however, have recently been working to revive the in-state rivalry.
“We have been in talks with [UMass] in the past years, but this works out better, because it’s guaranteed to be on TV,” said Tim Williamson, Harvard Assistant Director of Athletic Communications.
Crimson co-captain Brandyn Curry concurred with Williamson.
“Anytime we get to play on TV or ESPN it is always a great opportunity,” Curry said. “We really have to treasure those moments.”
Harvard returns 14 members from last year’s Tournament squad and will be led by co-captains Curry and Kyle Casey.
“We’re looking to comeback this season on a very strong note. This year, I think, will be a very special season,” Curry said.
UMass, likewise, is well-positioned for a successful 2012-2013 campaign. The Minutemen will return their top-four scorers from last season’s team, as well as all but one of their ten top-rebounding players, and Curry knows that the game will be hard-fought.
“I saw [UMass] a couple of times on ESPNU,” Curry said. “They are a well-coached team. It is going to be a very tough game. It will be a fun game to play. It will be a very fast, up-tempo game. I am looking forward to it.”
Harvard is among eight teams making their first appearance in the fifth annual Marathon event. UMass previously participated in the Marathon’s inaugural year of 2008, when the Minutemen lost to Memphis, 80-58. That same year Penn lost to Drexel, 66-64, in the Marathon—the only other time an Ivy League team has participated in ESPN’s opening slate of games.
The Harvard game will be the day’s sixth of the 11 ESPN televised games. The final two featured games of the day will showcase Michigan State versus National Championship runner-up Kansas and Duke versus defending National Champion Kentucky. The MSU-KU and Duke-UK games will be played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
The schedule of Marathon games—which includes 16 conferences, as well as 12 teams that played in last year’s Tournament—is:
Midnight: West Virginia at Gonzaga
2 a.m.: Davidson at New Mexico
4 a.m.: Houston Baptist at Hawaii
6 a.m.: Stony Brook at Rider
8 a.m.: Northern Illinois at Valparaiso
10 a.m.: Harvard at Massachusetts
12 p.m.: Temple at Kent State
2 p.m.: Detroit at St. John’s
4 p.m.: Butler at Xavier
7 p.m.: Michigan State vs. Kansas (Champions Classic, Georgia Dome, Atlanta)
30 minutes following MSU/KU: Duke vs. Kentucky (Champions Classic)

In town and looking for some good, healthy fun? Color Me Rad, a charitable 5K-run that supports the Simon Youth Foundation while turning runners all sorts of colors, is coming to Boston on Sunday.
The Color Me Rad group is touring the country this summer, coming fresh off of stops in Oklahoma City and Omaha, Neb. The organization encourages active, healthy living while supporting local charities and pure summer fun. Every participant starts the race in a white t-shirt and is then coated from head to toe by the “color bomb squad,” which lines the side of the course and makes sure that every participant ends the race with “a shirt tie-dyed with color, a bigger grin, and a lot more RAD.”
Sunday’s race is already sold out, but never fear: Color Me Rad will be returning to Boston next summer.
