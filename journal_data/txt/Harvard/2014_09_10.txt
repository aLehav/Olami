After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Words can hurt, some more than others. Much of the time, insults don’t really make us feel anything real—we only recognize that they’re supposed to be insults, that certain words are meant to be hurtful.
At Harvard, I’ve learned that, as an undocumented student, I should be insulted when I hear the word “illegal” followed by “immigrant” or “alien.” But I just can’t get with the times. “Illegal” has always been my go-to word to describe my status. To me, being illegal doesn’t mean being wrong. It just means being a victim of this country’s flawed immigration system.
I’m not alone. Eric Balderas ’14, an undocumented student, told me he thinks the movement to stop the use of the word “illegal” is a “form of censorship” that’s “often misplaced.” In fact, according to Balderas, no one has ever asked him about his opinion on the word.
“It’s an idea introduced by an elite audience,” he said. “Most illegal immigrants…aren’t even aware that this is a controversial topic or don’t care.”
And this is precisely the problem with avoiding the word. By doing so, we subscribe to a theory about immigration that comes from an elite group out of touch with the reality of being undocumented instead of from those who live in that reality. And that means we deny those who came here illegally the opportunity to define themselves on their own terms.
When we consider word “illegal” automatically offensive—rather than consider how we actually feel about the word—we are letting the word’s user, person, or institution, assume a position of dominance over us. We admit we care about what they have to say, and, to an extent, accept their authority and claim—that to be illegal is to be bad.
But we should not accept that claim. We should fight against it. We should remember that the illegality of students and workers is a consequence of our country’s broken immigration system, not of an intrinsic inferior quality in those immigrants. We should remember that there are many laws that act against the best interest of society as a whole, instead mostly serving the interests of the politically influential.
This nation’s immigration laws fit that bill. They deprive immigrants of the chance to become integrated into society and to contribute. They treat immigrants as criminals, when we enter the United States not to violate the sacred laws of the land but simply to survive.
There are families to be fed, children to be clothed and educated, and parents with no alternatives. These pressing needs—needs that must be met in order to live—often must take precedence over legal codes. And that’s why those codes need to shift to accommodate immigrants who want to work hard in the United States, for the country and for their families. America’s immigration laws are at the root of all the financial, physical, and mental struggles my family faces today, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
Whether we are undocumented or not, it can be insidious to let laws created by the privileged elite characterize others and us. When we view the word “illegal” as offensive, we assume that those who come here illegally are morally corrupt for their actions. Instead, it is the system that falls short of ethical standards.
We, the illegal immigrants, should be proud of our experiences and let every label we are assigned remind us of that experience. Such labels should never cause guilt, shame, or remorse.
So everyone: Say illegal, say it offhandedly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Something impressive: 70 percent of incoming freshmen responded to The Crimson’s freshman survey in August.
Forty-six percent of incoming Yale freshmen responded to the Yale Daily News’s counterpart. Maybe the YDN has lost some clout since Rory Gilmore’s departure from leadership. Or perhaps, quite sadly, the gap in participation rates confirms Yale’s status as the more artsy and alternative Ivy. Incoming Yale freshmen were probably too busy writing their next screenplays, listening to FKA Twigs, and just being cool in general to bother checking their emails.
I should also probably note that, despite the fact that I come dangerously close to mistaking correlation for causation throughout this entire op-ed, I did indeed take Stat 104. (Side note: Only three people filled out the Survey Monkey I posted in the Harvard Class of 2016 Facebook group for my Stat 104 final project, so The Crimson clearly has better communication pathways than I do.)
So here’s a rundown.
The Crimson’s freshman survey effectively conveys that incoming Harvard freshman do indeed live in the world. Folks who plan on concentrating in Economics and STEM fields believe that they will make more money when they graduate than those who plan on pursuing the humanities do.
On a more serious note, the survey also affirms that issues of safety, diversity, and inclusion need more attention here. Incoming females think about sexual assault far more than incoming males. The survey also indicates that most legacy students are white, and white students are more likely to have paid for things like private admissions counseling.
That was intense. But those who have read the freshman survey also know that some of its contents were extremely funny. For one, its conclusion that international students have had more sexual partners than non-internationals brings to mind the wildly untrue but nonetheless amusing idea that members of the Woodbridge International Society live their lives to the lyrics of Pitbull songs (I don’t play football but I’ve touched down everywhere. Everywhere? Everywhere!).
To the kid who got in to 30 schools: Do less. To the ten percent of you who cheated on an exam in high school: Really?! And to the 1.7 percent of you who plan on spending ten or fewer hours studying per week, will you please keep me updated on your progress and teach me your ways?
Forty-five percent of incoming freshmen described themselves as “somewhat interested” in joining a fraternity, sorority, or final club. The Crimson did not find out what percentage of those males have subsequently made the decision to try and walk on the crew team.
Although I still fail to understand the motivation behind the emphasis on certain statistics in these articles, I nonetheless appreciate the holistic nature of The Crimson’s reporting. The observation that incoming Jewish students are on average more supportive of legalizing marijuana was extremely random. But, for those two students who did not read the survey and happen to be reading this op-ed, you’re welcome. I just made it a little easier for you to perform religious profiling when you’re looking for buddies who would be down to get high.
Also, the paragraph titled “Apple Nation” told me that a bunch of people here own Mac computers and iPhones.
I guess what I really want to say is that everybody (yes, I’m talking to you two) should just read the freshman survey. If you believe that Harvard is bursting with diversity, the survey results may rightfully ask you to question that view. But, as you read, do so with a watchful eye.
Some statistics are important—we should all care that 72 percent of incoming freshmen come from families whose income exceeds that of the average American family by over $29,000. However, let us be skeptical about the urge to categorize this class into groups like rural Jewish stoners. Mere existence does not necessarily make a connection interesting or important.
In any case, the freshman survey will make you laugh, because, much like this op-ed, some of it does not make sense. It may even make you cry glistening tears, especially since you’re in a pretty emotional place right now and you’ve been thinking a lot about your time at Harvard and what it means and all of the classmates you’ve met and all of the ones you haven’t and data visualization always gets you feeling some type of way. I don’t know.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 8, 2004, Harvard alumnus Steve Moore ’01 suffered a broken neck and a career ending concussion in what was later deemed a criminal assault during an NHL hockey game.
On that fateful day in March everything changed for him. With the game close to completion, Vancouver Canucks player Todd Bertuzzi attempted to pick a fight with Moore, then a rookie with the Colorado Avalanche. After Moore turned down the invitation and skated away, Bertuzzi skated up behind Moore, punched him in the head and then drove his face into the ice. Moore never played another game in the NHL. To this day, he suffers from post-concussion syndrome.
Moore filed a $68 million dollar lawsuit against Bertuzzi and the Vancouver Canucks organization, with the trial set to begin September 8, 2014 in a Toronto courthouse. It was anticipated that the lawsuit would spark intense and unprecedented debate on the role of fighting and concussions in hockey.
However, a couple weeks before the trial date, the long-awaited case was settled, and it seems that everything will go back to normal. But, what is normal?
The NHL still has a serious problem with player safety and concussions. Worse, most don’t seem to acknowledge that a problem exists—many continue to argue that fighting in hockey improves overall player safety.
Don Cherry—a popular hockey commentator in Canada and a former head coach of the Boston Bruins—has explained that there is a code among hockey players that is entrenched in the culture of the NHL. According to the code, it is respectable to use honorable violence (the hockey fight) to deter dishonorable hockey violence (cheap shots and dirty plays). The belief is that the fear of getting “beat-up” by the opposing team’s enforcer deters players from taking cheap shots and engaging in “dirty” plays.
It’s often suggested that Bertuzzi was originally following the code by pursuing Moore. A few weeks before the assault, in an earlier game between Colorado and Vancouver, Moore delivered a body check—deemed legal at the time—to Markus Nasland, who was Todd Bertuzzi’s linemate. Nasland suffered a concussion from the hit and missed the next three games. According to Bertuzzi, his coach allegedly told the players that they needed to make sure that Moore paid the price for injuring Nasland.
If Bertuzzi’s intent was enforcing the code, we can see how it can produce a vicious circle of hockey violence, rather than its intended effect of policing against cheap shots and dirty plays.
There were 789 hockey fights involving 340 players the same season that the Bertuzzi-Moore incident took place. Also, fights broke out in 41 percent of the games played. That’s a lot of self-policing, if proponents of the hockey fighting code are correct.
If we consider the research on concussions and brain damage associated with direct blows to the head, these statistics mean that 340 players faced serious health and safety risks while being employed by NHL hockey organizations. The deterrent effect of fighting that proponents have described is nowhere apparent.
Perhaps that is because hockey fighting is also about fan entertainment.
Simply ask fans who used to watch former enforcer Tie Domi fight. He was entertaining, especially when he fought Bob Probert, the toughest fighter in the league. In his book, Probert is famously quoted as saying “A lot of people are down on fighting in the NHL. They say it doesn’t belong in the game. But like Don Cherry says, ‘When Probert was fighting, did you ever see anyone get out of their seat and go for coffee?’”
Sadly, Bob Probert, died at the age of 45. It was later discovered that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma.
Hockey violence is such a huge part of fan culture that websites like www.hockeyfights.com are flourishing. This particular website allows fans to watch every fight, in every season, across 11 different hockey leagues. On April 15, 2012, Sidney Crosby and Claude Giroux, two of the most talented hockey players in the world, fought each other. According to fan votes online, Crosby won that fight.
But a close review of these fights shows that there is no single logic justifying these fights. Why would Crosby (or Giroux) fight each other? They are both the superstars that “the enforcers” on their team are supposed to protect.
Crosby had been suffering from concussions throughout that season and had only been back playing for one month when he fought Giroux. Again, why would Crosby, arguably the world’s greatest hockey player, risk another concussion?
Perhaps the overriding logic is simply that fighting is an institutionalized part of the culture. While the hockey code might help to explain what a player was thinking when he entered into a fight, there is no evidence that it actually improves safety in the way that proponents of the code hypothesize. Our growing knowledge of concussions is rendering the code increasingly problematic.
It’s time for the NHL to question the continued implicit endorsement of a code that legitimizes honorable violence as a way for players to self-police each other. While the lawsuit against Bertuzzi and the Vancouver Canucks has been settled, it has only temporarily allowed the NHL to avoid having the hockey code put under a microscope.
Concussions are not going away and neither are the lawsuits.
As for Steve Moore, in 2013, he set up the Steve Moore Foundation with a mission to raise awareness on concussions in sports. In the spring of 2015, his foundation will host the First Annual SMF Concussion Conference in Toronto.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gone are the days of the American grilled cheese and the chickwich. This fall, Harvard University Dining Services ushered in a new era, one where the Vermont cheddar sandwich and the ruby beet and kale vegan burger reign supreme.
The newest HUDS changes, while welcome, are long overdue. Especially at a school where students living on campus have no choice but to subscribe to a full, expensive meal plan, dining ought to be both satisfying and salubrious. And while the HUDS update improves the College’s services on both scores, there is still more to be done.
That is not to be pessimistic, though. In many ways, we herald the HUDS overhaul. Healthy options abound: A greater variety of vegetarian and vegan options at the grill along with creative pre-made salads encourage students with dietary restrictions to skip the golden nuggets and go for something less likely to induce a heart attack.
What’s more, the move to an open servery between lunch and dinner allows students more flexibility and a higher chance of getting the full bang for their tuition buck when they can eat at dining halls rather than out in the square even with difficult schedules.
But that tuition buck is one reason why we look forward to future changes. Board for one semester at Harvard costs $2,830. Assuming a student eats three meals a day seven days a week, this price tag brings the cost of each meal to $8.75. Because most students do not eat this many meals in the dining hall—and because weekday breakfast anywhere besides Annenberg consists of little more than oatmeal and hard-boiled eggs—the true price of a HUDS meal for the average student is likely even higher.
And, though HUDS is doing better, we hope these more promising dining hall days will grow brighter still. As the year continues, we look forward to further efforts for improvement, whether that means a less monotonous rotation of hot-bar dishes or more late-night dining options beyond cereal and goldfish. HUDS should take care to continue soliciting and responding to student opinion when considering these changes, and it should also be transparent in the comments and criticism it receives and the costs it incurs.
Harvard is world-renowned for the education it provides its students. It is unlikely its food will ever meet that standard, but at least it has come little closer.

After years of discussion, the City of Cambridge is moving ahead with the construction of a public toilet in Harvard Square this fall. The toilet, which is expected to serve the needs of both residents and the local homeless population, will be located in General MacArthur Square between Harvard Yard and the Old Burying Ground on Massachusetts Ave.
According to Kathy Watkins, a city engineer and the assistant commissioner for engineering for the Cambridge Department of Public Works, installing the toilet will cost about $350,000 to $400,000 in total, with the structure itself costing about $90,000.
“The goal is really to provide an accessible safe place for public restrooms,” Watkins said. “There’s obviously a strong need.”
The city chose to utilize the Portland Loo, a type of public toilet installed originally in Portland, Ore., which has since been installed by seven other cities, according to Watkins. She described the toilet as very sturdy, but also said that the city will still spend $25,000 a year on maintenance and upkeep.
“It’s a sleek, durable design that’s easy to maintain, very hardy, it’s sized appropriately.... It’s stainless steel,” Watkins said. “We’re committed for multiple-times-a-day maintenance.”
The project gained momentum in 2012 when the Christ Church Cambridge closed the use of its bathroom to the public. According to Kennedy School of Government lecturer and Christ Church member Richard Parker, “[drug] overdoses, near deaths, and harassment of the staff” were among the reasons for the closure.
As the need for a public bathroom escalated, a coalition of churches, businesses, and organizations for the homeless formed to lobby for a public toilet. The coalition conducted a survey of Cambridge residents, workers, and visitors and collected over 6,000 signatures in support for the request.
Parker predicts that the construction of the toilet will produce great results and will positively impact the Harvard Square homeless community in particular.
“It will give a small sense of greater humanity to the Square,” Parker said. “It’s a great reminder that we can help people in a small way with great consequences.”
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the local business community became involved in the process about two years ago when Cambridge Police began to receive phone calls related to the Christ Church bathroom. In addition to working with the MBTA to reopen the Harvard Square T-stop restroom, Jillson said the HSBA also campaigned for a portable toilet in Cambridge Common.
“We worked very closely with the MBTA to reopen the toilet to the public.... It still wasn’t enough,” Jillson said. “We worked very closely with the social services agencies, particularly Youth On Fire, for a porta-john to be installed in Cambridge Common.“
Citing the strain on local businesses that have had to deal with the number of people seeking a restroom, Jillson said the process of securing a public toilet was smooth and that she was pleased with the location of the toilet.
“We’re frankly really pleased with the process,” Jillson said. “It’s a great location.... Certainly early next year we’ll have it up and flushing.”
Watkins wrote in an email that the toilet is currently on schedule to be installed either this fall or early next spring.
“We will be installing the utility connections this fall and are currently in the process of ordering the toilet. It is a specialty item and has a long lead time,” Watkins wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf expressed concern about the long-term effects of the current West African Ebola epidemic during a live video chat at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday.
While Sirleaf, an alumna of the Kennedy School of Government, said the current epidemic has "surpassed our capacity to respond," she added that she remains optimistic about recent efforts to control the spread of the virus.
The current outbreak of Ebola—a contagious disease that causes internal hemorrhaging and death—originated in Guinea in March and has since spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is the largest ever documented outbreak of the disease. As of September 5, 3,960 cases of Ebola have been identified in the region by the World Health Organization, and the virus has caused 2,105 deaths, according to Kennedy School lecturer Sheila P. Burke, who moderated the forum. The number may also be far greater due to unreported cases, Burke said.
According to Sirleaf, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in Liberia lies in the capital city of Monrovia, whereas Ebola in the other West African countries has been contained mostly to rural areas, making the situation particularly serious in infected areas in Liberia due to higher population density.
Sirleaf also noted that deeply rooted Liberian cultural traditions and “strong religious feelings” regarding treatment of the dead could be responsible for exacerbating the quick spread of the disease.
Despite 700 confirmed deaths in Liberia—over 40 of those from health workers attempting to treat infected patients—Sirleaf, citing doctors that have been evacuated and treated in U.S. hospitals, said that there is still hope. Given recently enacted travel bans, containment efforts, and improved health care, Sirleaf said that the epidemic may continue to spread for the next two to three weeks and then hopefully stabilize.
“It remains a very grave situation,” Sirleaf said. “It is taking a long time to respond effectively. But now we have set in motion some of those measures that are shaping to see results.”
Looking ahead, Sirleaf added she is “very concerned” about the long-term economic implications of the virus. Many of the large organizations and corporations in Liberia have been forced to either slow operations or shut down, and cross-border trade has been limited, according to Sirleaf.
Following the question-and-answer session with Sirleaf, the conversation switched over to T. H. Chan School of Public Health Professors Michael J. VanRooyen and Dyann F. Wirth.
Wirth, a global leader in malaria research, said that there is significant work being done in the development of a vaccine for the disease, with two options currently in accelerated trials.
VanRooyen, director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, added that the World Health Organization’s classification of the Ebola outbreak as an international emergency came weeks too late, after the disease had already done irreparable damage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard does not normally rename its schools. But last fall, shortly after William F. Lee ’72 was announced as the next Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation, he got a call from an old friend, Gerald L. Chan, who wanted to discuss just that.
The conversation started casually. Lee and Chan, who have known each other for more than 20 years, joked that Harvard now has at least one Chinese graduate who is a billionaire—Chan—and another—Lee—who runs the University’s highest governing body.
“We wondered what the Puritans would think about the whole thing,” Lee told The Crimson with a laugh on Tuesday.
Quickly, though, the two men moved beyond pleasantries. Chan, who inherited money from his late father T. H. Chan and has by most accounts multiplied that wealth since, was upfront with his old friend.
“He raised the possibility of naming the School of Public Health for his father,” Lee remembered on Tuesday. “I told him right away that it was a really interesting possibility, and we ought to talk about it.”
The first person Lee called after hanging up was University President Drew G. Faust—“I wouldn’t call anybody else first,” Lee explained on Tuesday—and quickly, the process was set in motion. The Corporation convened soon after to consider an appropriate price for the renaming of the School of Public Health.
“We discussed what would be the fair amount to name a school like the School of Public Health, and after consulting with the president and the other fellows, we brought [the amount] to Gerald,” Lee said, adding that Chan did not take long to agree in principle to the Corporation’s figure, $350 million. “There was very little negotiation.”
Speaking with The Crimson last week, Faust said that the renaming reflected  “a desire to recognize and honor the enormous contribution and generosity that this represents...we feel this is an appropriate recognition of this level of generosity, which is unprecedented.”
By the end of July, Lee said, the deal was done. An announcement was planned for Monday, Sept. 8, when students would be back on campus and Chan, who travels frequently for business, was scheduled to be in Boston. The gift was unveiled during a ceremony at the newly renamed Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, where Chan earned a Ph.D. in the 1970s.
Before Monday, only two Harvard schools had been renamed in its centuries-long history: in 1639, a newly-established college in Cambridge, Mass., took the name of its first benefactor, John Harvard. More than three centuries later, in 1966, the institution renamed its graduate school of public administration in honor of a fallen president, John F. Kennedy ’40.
Going forward, though, Harvard Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 said the Corporation should be ready to have the renaming conversation again.
“If anyone is considering a gift at this level or higher, and is proposing naming rights, the Corporation should give it full consideration,” he said in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
JOINING A TREND
With the christening of the T. H. Chan School, Harvard has joined the ranks of institutions around the world that have traded naming rights for philanthropy. In doing so, the University places itself in a movement that philanthropy experts say has become more popular as the race for funding has grown more competitive.
“It certainly [has been] very common in the rest of higher education,” said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. “You can see names on seats at theaters and some schools have gone to the extreme of putting names on bathrooms and bathroom fixtures.”
Of U.S. News & World Report’s top 25 ranked business schools for 2014, only four—those of Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Yale—do not bear a name adopted in recognition of philanthropy or in honor of an individual.
Currently, Stanford, Yale, and Princeton are Harvard’s only peer institutions to have not renamed any graduate school in recognition of a significant benefactor or other individual. Yet Princeton does not have any professional schools, and administrators at Yale’s School of Management have indicated that they would be open to changing the name, according to a 2006 Businessweek article.
Administrators at Harvard’s business school have previously said they would not be willing to rename the school. David R. Lampe, executive director of marketing and communications at the Business School, told Businessweek at the time, “[Harvard’s] brand equity…is of incalculable value, and we have no intention of abandoning it.”
Experts in philanthropy said this week that they were surprised to hear that Harvard has entered the naming rights game and added that the move signals a paradigm shift in the way the University approaches fundraising.
“I think it makes clear that Harvard weighed the value of tradition against an enormous contribution and decided the contribution was worth it,” said Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. “It absolutely sets a precedent when the Business School or the Divinity School or the School of Education are talking to potential big donors in the future. Donors will be aware that Harvard is open to selling naming rights.”
RAISING THE BAR
After news of the record-setting gift broke on Monday, some of Harvard’s top donors made it clear that the sheer size of the gift stands out more than the renaming.
“It’s a total game changer,” said Mitchell L. Dong ’75, an energy entrepreneur and longtime University supporter who is also a member of the University’s prestigious Committee on University Resources. “All the money’s going into the endowment. It’s not current use money, and it’s completely unrestricted. This will be money that will be at [School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk’s] discretion every year.”
In particular, Dong, who sits on the dean’s council at the School of Public Health, focused on Frenk’s top stated priority: relieving debt burdens for students at the school.
“There’s a lot of alumni who can’t go work in less developed countries at an NGO because they have to pay off a lot of student debt,” Dong said. “This should free them up.”
Peter J. Malkin ’55, a real estate mogul who has been a member of the Board of Overseers and whose family renovated and renamed the Malkin Athletic Center, called the gift “marvelous, well placed, and a lift for the campaign.”
Richard L. Menschel, a graduate of the Business School who gave $12.5 million to the School of Public Health last year, downplayed the renaming. He added that that the size of the gift sets a new high water mark for Harvard fundraising.
“It’s a wonderful gift, and I can’t wait to see what can be done with it, and what can be thrown off every year,” he said, referring to annual dividends from the principal that will flow into the School of Public Health budget. “It sets a new bar. Now of course that doesn’t mean we won’t accept the $100 million gifts any more, but it sets a new bar, and not only for Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activists emphasized the power of art in their efforts to advance gay rights in Uganda as the American Repertory Theater and the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy kicked off The A.R.T. of Human Rights at their first public event at the Oberon Tuesday.
The series is hosted by Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, director of the Carr Center’s Sexuality, Gender, and Human Rights Program and a member of Harvard’s faculty. During Tuesday’s event, “Bearing Witness to Uganda: God, Gays, and Human Rights,” he talked with four artists and activists who are working on issues that involve human rights in Uganda—Matt Gould, Griffin Matthews, John “Long Jones” Wambere, and Malika Zouhali-Worrall.
The conversation centered around the intersection of art and activism and how the four panelists have used those tools to spark larger discussions about Uganda.
“We focus on Uganda in terms of this terrible story of persecution, but it is actually one of the shining lights...for LGBTI activism on the continent,” Zouhali-Worrall said.
Zouhali-Worrall is the producer and co-director of “Call Me Kuchu,” a documentary that takes a look at Uganda’s BGLTQ activist community and follows the story of their fight against anti-homosexuality laws that have been brought to the Ugandan parliament. The film also tells the story of David Kato, a Ugandan BGLTQ activist who was killed in 2011, during the time that Zouhali-Worrall was working on the documentary. Zouhali-Worrall showed a clip from "Call Me Kuchu" that introduced Kato as she had known him.
Another Ugandan gay rights activist featured in "Call Me Kuchu," Wambere, spoke at the event on Tuesday night about his experience as an activist from the inside. Living in Kampala, Wambere gained notoriety as a gay man and was outed by newspapers in the city, which has become common practice in Uganda.
Wambere was invited to the United States to raise awareness of homosexual persecution, and during his trip, the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Law was signed by the president of Uganda. Wambere is now living in the Boston area and seeking asylum in the U.S. with the help of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.
The evening also featured a performance of selected songs from “Witness Uganda,” a musical created by Matthews and Gould about Matthews’s journey of discovering himself, Uganda, and the students he came to work with in his nonprofit, Uganda Project.
“[Musical theater] lends itself well to taking individual moments and exploding them into mind bending, loud, in your face, emotional songs,” Gould said. “I think that the art form of musical theater really lends itself to this topic that so need to be cried and screamed about.”
The A.R.T. of Human Rights, which is a yearlong program, has another dimension besides the public events like seminars and discussions. According to the series planners, they also seek to cultivate deep connections with local schools and organizations like GLAD and Lowell High School, where McCarthy, Matthews, and Gould spent the day with over 200 students on Tuesday discussing the same topics that were covered in the public event.
“This is a series meant to catalyze not only discussion and debate, but also action and advocacy,” McCarthy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 14, 2014, at 5:45 p.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Committee on Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures hosted the first in a series of discussions about sexual and gender-based harassment at Harvard on Tuesday, drawing a small crowd of students to a common room in Cabot House.
Just under 30 people, including several members of the committee, as well as a House master, a House dean, and tutors, attended the discussion.
FAS Committee Chair Alison Frank Johnson led the conversation, which mostly followed a question-and-answer format, on the new University Title IX policy and its implications for FAS.
With the University policy already in place, FAS has been operating under an interim policy developed by the committee in late summer.
The focus of the event was on the interim FAS policy and associated procedures, which include, in addition to the University-wide sexual assault policy, an introduction and FAS-specific policies, such as those relating to disciplinary action.
The discussion first touched upon the potential disciplinary consequences in the event of a policy violation. Under the recently created procedures, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution will determine if the accused FAS affiliate violated the policy. With that information, the relevant FAS disciplinary body, such as the College’s Administrative Board, would have the authority to hand down appropriate disciplinary sanctions.
Responding to a question from a student, Johnson said that while the committee would consider requiring FAS disciplinary bodies to uphold minimum sanctions for certain violations, she personally was not in favor of such a policy.
Though FAS policy does not specify minimum sanctions for sexual harassment violations, former Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison said last spring that in cases of rape, the Ad Board has historically required accused students to withdraw from the school, in certain cases even recommending that the student be dismissed or expelled.
In an interview on Friday, Brett Flehinger, interim secretary of the Ad Board, said that he did not foresee any official changes from the set of sanctions that the body currently uses in handling cases of sexual assault.
Students also voiced confusion about the use of terms like violence and coercion, raising concerns about the role of the policy in clarifying and defining such language.
Amid questions and comments about the University-wide language, which makes up the bulk of the interim policy, Johnson said that there was little the FAS Committee could do to alter that language. Its influence is limited to the introductory language, definitions of relationships within the FAS community, and some procedures concerning discipline as it relates to the various FAS disciplinary bodies.
The FAS Committee on Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures was convened by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in May to bring the FAS policy on sexual harassment in line with the University-wide Title IX policy. The FAS Committee will meet for the first time this academic year on Thursday and will host five more open discussions over the course of the next month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The race to replace Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 is set.
Though Democrat Martha M. Coakley had a closer challenge in her party’s primary than many predicted, she prevailed and will face Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 in November’s general election.
Coakley is the state’s attorney general, but she is also known for a bitter 2010 loss to former Massachusetts Sen. Scott P. Brown.
Baker served at the cabinet level under two Republican governors in the 1990s and also spent ten years as the CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. Baker has defined himself as more progressive than the national Republican Party, voicing support for abortion rights as well as same-sex marriage.
Baker’s primary was over soon after the polls closed, and he defeated opponent Mark Fisher by a huge margin.
“We want to bring a new...brand of bipartisan leadership that will bring balance to state government and opportunity to all of our citizens,” Baker told supporters at a victory rally.
Speaking after 11 p.m., Coakley, who defeated her top challenger, Massachusetts Treasurer Steve Grossman, by a margin of just six percentage points according to results at press time, did not wait long to go negative against her general election opponent.
“From our economic wellbeing to defending our personal rights, we know the Republican Charlie Baker is the wrong voice for Massachusetts,” she said during a long speech which highlighted Baker’s alleged shortcomings.
It was a good night for Harvard graduates in other races around the state. Former marine and political newcomer Seth W. Moulton ’01 upended veteran Sixth District Rep. John Tierney—a nine-term representative—in the district’s Democratic primary.
And Democrat Maura T. Healey ’92 capitalized on a late streak of momentum to run over former State Sen. Warren Tolman, who began the race as the heavy favorite, in the attorney general primary.
“As an advocate, as a prosecutor, as a civil rights attorney, you have to lead, you have to make your case, and you have to give it all your heart,” Healy, a former Crimson basketball player, told a crowd of cheering supporters. “We just made the case to the voters: but we’ve got to go back to work, because we’ve got another trial Nov. 4.”
If she wins in November against Republican John Miller, Healey will be the first openly gay attorney general in the United States.
With the stage set for November’s elections, the pace on the campaign trail is expected to pick up. Moulton will face the popular Republican, Richard Tisei, a former state lawmaker who nearly beat Tierney in the Sixth Congressional District in 2012.
Statewide, the race is also on for a less-heralded office: the lieutenant governorship. In the Democratic primary for that office, vocal Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung came in a distant second to Stephen Kerrigan, who will now pair with Coakley. Karyn Polito, who has already joined forces with Baker, won on the Republican side.
Elsewhere, Brown easily won the Republican senatorial primary in New Hampshire, where he moved after losing his Massachusetts senate seat to former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren in 2012. Brown will now face Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in a race that is already drawing national attention.
And in Rhode Island, Gina M. Raimondo ’93, the state’s treasurer, won the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Raimondo has made waves as treasurer for taking on organized labor groups in reworking Rhode Island’s pension system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 10, 2014, at 4:10 p.m.
Eric P. Lesser ’07, a former Kirkland House tutor and Harvard Law School alumnus, secured the Democratic nomination for the Massachusetts State Senate seat for the 1st Hampden and Hampshire District in western Massachusetts Tuesday.
With 32 percent of the vote, Lesser, of Longmeadow, beat out Springfield City Council member Timothy C. Allen, Ludlow School Committee member James P. “Chip” Harrington, Hampden County Correctional Center counselor Tom Lachiusa, and Aaron Saunders, former chief of staff for the district’s current senator—Gale Candaras—to secure his place on November’s ballot.
Lesser announced his temporary departure from Kirkland House in late February to devote time to his campaign.
Simon M. Thompson ’14, a volunteer on Lesser’s campaign, said Lesser’s “energy and positivity” to rally voters sets him apart from his competitors.
“He has been a very strong cohering force since his undergraduate days,” Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley said of Lesser. “When he left in the spring of this year it was with great regret but also great anticipation that we saw him leave.”
Lesser will face Republican Debra Boronski and independent candidate Mike Franco in November’s general election.
If Lesser takes the seat in the general election, Conley said he predicts that he will perform “magnificently” and “with a sense of congeniality and of generosity that I think is very uncommon in the unfortunate political sphere in which we are living.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second season as a varsity sport, the Harvard women’s rugby team has set the goal of firmly establishing itself in both the Harvard athletic and national rugby communities. The team, which opens its Ivy League season against Brown this weekend, has set its sights on validating last year’s success.
“The training wheels have come off,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “This is the year when we prove that it was the right decision...to give us an opportunity to play varsity.”
However, some would argue that the team already proved itself in its debut season. Last fall, the Crimson brought home an Ivy League championship with a championship game victory over Dartmouth, 29-0. In the spring, Harvard was the only Ivy League team to qualify for the Division I National Championships.
Now, Kantor says, the team wants to prove that wasn’t a fluke.
The Crimson will have to do so with many new faces on the field this fall. Harvard lost 10 seniors, including All-American Shelby Lin ’14 and the team’s leading scorer and former captain, Xanni Brown ’14. This class of seniors, players said, not only guided Harvard’s transition from a club sport to a varsity sport, but also provided the leadership, energy, and skill that made the team’s inaugural season a success.
However, although this team has fewer standouts, it has flexibility and depth.
“Every time we get out onto the field, any one of the 15 players on the field can be the person who calls the next play or the person who scores,” said co-captain and Crimson editor Hope Schwartz. “It makes practice not only more interesting because we’re all thinking on our feet and taking responsibility, but also just a lot more fun.”
This season, the Crimson is trying to take advantage of its versatility. Different players are rotating through different positions and working to improve their proficiency in all aspects of the game, from passing and kicking to body positioning and tackling.
“Having good technique not only elevates our game, but also prevents a lot of needless injuries that every rugby team experiences because of the nature of the game,” Schwartz said. “We want to stay safe and play fast and clean and hard.”
Amidst the turnover, one position that has not changed is that of head coach Sue Parker, who begins her second season at Harvard. The team will rely on Parker for her leadership and experience as many players adjust to new positions and starting roles.
“Coach Parker is someone who holds us to very high standards, but totally attainable standards,” Kantor said. “She knows very realistically what we are capable of.”
After consecutive contests with Yale, Cornell, and Princeton, Harvard’s Ivy League campaign culminates with a highly-anticipated game against Dartmouth.
After losing to the Big Green in the regular season and bouncing back to beat them in the Ivy Championship last season, the Crimson expects this contest will be a pivotal test for the team.
It will be a game “to prove that we have come so far from being a team that had just transitioned to varsity to a team that’s worthy and proud of our varsity status,” Schwartz said.
Even off the field, the Crimson has set out to be an example for all of women’s rugby. Last May, after the season ended, the team published a photo series and essay on body image for the Harvard Political Review, which received national attention and articles in Time and Cosmo.
When asked if this project and its publicity increased the team’s cohesion and camaraderie, Schwartz said, “it is actually demonstrative of a culture that’s existed on our team since long before any of us have been here. It’s indicative of the positivity and love we have for one another.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s soccer team traveled to University of Rhode Island, the Crimson suffered a 3-2 loss in double overtime in 2011. In a Tuesday night showdown three years later, Harvard (3-0-0) reversed that score, dealing the Rams (4-1-1) their first loss of the season.
With the game locked at two, the Crimson entered halftime with little momentum on its side. After jumping out to an early 2-0 lead, Harvard surrendered that advantage by the middle of the first half, allowing URI to dominate possession in the half’s final 20 minutes.
But, players said, the Crimson came out in the second half determined to win.
“We knew that the team that won the first five minutes of the second half was probably going to win the game,” co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “So we came out and defended hard and just kept the ball and tried to keep our rhythm.”
Eleven minutes into the second half, Casscells-Hamby provided the difference. She poked the ball by Rams senior goalkeeper Reilly Lindsey to record her first goal of the season and give Harvard a 3-2 lead.
The margin stood up. Strong possession and defense throughout the second half prevented URI from taking a shot on goal in the final 30 minutes of the game.
In the battle between undefeated teams, Harvard wasted no time getting on the board. In the third minute of the game, junior midfielder Brooke Dickens headed a corner from senior forward Lauren Urke into the back of the net.
The Crimson built on its early lead when senior midfielder Bethany Kanten powered a shot past Lindsey from 30 yards out. Kanten, a goalkeeper for Harvard for the past three years, made the switch to playing out in the field this season because of injury.
After scoring the first goal of her Crimson career, Kanten said, “It was really great to experience it with my team and to have it happen in a game like tonight against an undefeated team.”
The Rams immediately battled back and seized the momentum after Kanten’s goal. In the 24th minute, URI freshman defender Simone Hansen hit in a bicycle kick off a corner to put the Rams on the board. A little over 30 seconds later, URI’s leading scorer, junior forward Ari Stanton, found the back of the net to even the score, 2-2.
Strong goalkeeping from senior Cheta Emba helped fend off the Rams’ continued offensive attack in the first half. After letting in two goals, the first that the Crimson had let up this season, Emba made two saves late in the half to keep the score even into halftime.
“[Emba] did really well to keep us in it,” Kanten said. “Even after getting scored on, she did really well to stay strong and fight through it to keep us in the game.”
Sophomore goalie Lizzie Durack picked up in the second half where Emba left off. Durack came up with back-to-back saves in the 58th minute to preserve the Crimson’s lead.
Although URI outshot Harvard 11-10 overall, 6-5 in terms of shots on goal, strong play from Emba and Durack kept the Crimson from ever trailing in the game.
With the win, Harvard extended its regular season unbeaten streak to 17 games. The Crimson has not lost a regular season game since Sep. 11, 2013, when the team lost, 2-1, to New Hampshire.
The team then went undefeated in Ivy League play en route to the league title, with the squad’s season ending with a 1-0 loss to the Boston Terriers in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
This is the first time the Crimson has won its three opening games since 2005. In its first two contests, Harvard  shut out San Francisco and Providence by a combined score of 3-0 behind two goals from sophomore forward Midge Purce. But, as the players emphasized, much of this team’s success comes from not focusing on long-term records.
“We always just take it game by game,” Kanten said. “Just trying to get better before Ivies start is the most important thing to us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the full Harvard men’s basketball schedule has not yet been released, The Back Page took a look at a variety of sources to try and identify who the team will be playing in 2014-2015.
In trying to piece the schedule together, the first place I looked was the Harvard Crimson ticket website. From this we can see the list of schools Harvard will be playing at home, giving the following schedule:
Nov. 14 v. MIT
Nov. 20 v. Florida Atlantic
Nov. 25 v. Houston
Nov. 29 v. Massachusetts
Dec. 3 v. Northeastern
Dec. 8 v. Boston University
Jan. 24 v. Dartmouth
Feb. 13 v. Columbia
Feb. 14 v. Cornell
Feb. 20 v. Pennsylvania
Feb. 21 v. Princeton
Mar. 6 v. Yale
Mar. 7 v. Brown
In recent years, I would expect to add an early January road date at Connecticut to the list, but a glance at the Huskies’ schedule indicates the game will not happen. Early advertising indicates that the team will once again compete in the Coaches vs. Cancer tripleheader with a rematch of last year’s opening-day game against Holy Cross in TD Garden on Nov. 16.
To fill out the rest of the nonconference road schedule, I looked at the posted home schedules for Harvard’s non-conference opponents from last year. Those schedules indicated that Harvard will travel to Vermont on Dec. 6, to Boston College on Jan. 17, and to Bryant on Jan. 20. Scouring of other schedules indicates that the team’s marquee games will be at UVA (Dec. 21) and Arizona State (Dec. 28), with a road date at Grand Canyon on Dec. 30.
Next came a look at the rest of the Ivy League schedule. The Ancient Eight’s unique scheduling quirks -- back-to-back weekend games and set pair-scheduling (i.e. any opponent playing Cornell on Friday must play Columbia on Saturday, and vice versa) -- make this easy to do. Dartmouth, which plays the same teams every weekend as Harvard, has already posted its schedule. The schedule demonstrates that Harvard will be playing five of the first sixth Ivy League games on the road, with an Ivy League road schedule of:
Jan. 10 at Dartmouth
Jan. 30 at Princeton
Jan. 31 at Penn
Feb. 6 at Brown
Feb. 7 at Yale
Feb. 27 at Cornell
Feb. 28 at Columbia
Thus, the final best approximation we can have of the team’s full schedule looks like this:
Nov. 14 v. MIT
Nov. 16 v. Holy Cross
Nov. 20 v. Florida Atlantic
Nov. 25 v. Houston
Nov. 29 v. Massachusetts
Dec. 3 v. Northeastern
Dec. 6 at Vermont
Dec. 8 v. Boston University
Dec. 21 at UVA
Dec. 28 at Arizona State
Dec. 30 at Grand Canyon
Jan. 10 at Dartmouth
Jan. 17 at Boston College
Jan. 20 at Bryant
Jan. 24 v. Dartmouth
Jan. 30 at Princeton
Jan. 31 at Penn
Feb. 6 at Brown
Feb. 7 at Yale
Feb. 13 v. Columbia
Feb. 14 v. Cornell
Feb. 20 v. Pennsylvania
Feb. 21 v. Princeton
Feb. 27 at Cornell
Feb. 28 at Columbia
Mar. 6 v. Yale
Mar. 7 v. Brown

For those unimpressed by the college diplomas of their Tinder matches and looking for a new way to “date intelligently”, check out an app created by a Stanford business school grad: The League. The League is open only to the crème de la crème of singles on the market: “You’re smart, good-looking & successful. You don’t need a dating app to get a date—you’re too popular as it is. But you should join The League,” the app’s website reads.
Promising an “advanced screening algorithm to keep our community well-balanced and high-quality,” The League requires the elites (elitists?) to submit their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles in order to join. Yes, potential users must provide evidence of worthy personal and professional lives. The app promises “no fakes” and “no randoms”: “You’ll never have to wonder if that Harvard hottie is too good to be true on The League.” Phew, what a relief.
Interested in joining? The app will launch first in San Francisco, and then expand to other cities, if enough people are looking to #getmeofftinder (the hashtag featured on the app’s social media pages). Cambridge anxiously awaits.

One (or both, according to some), sold their soul to the devil. The other finds the idea of a Satanic black mass ‘abhorrent’. But how different are Harvard University President Drew Faust and Goethe’s Faust really? See if you can tell which Faust the quotes below came from. It might be harder than you’d think! Answers are below, or click the links to find out.
1. Look to the past to help create the future. Look to science and to poetry.
2. I am not omniscient, but I know a lot.
3.  I had hoped you would carry on your campaign with a greater degree of civility and fairness.
4. … Subvert the academic freedoms and values necessary to the free flow of ideas.
5. I often know amid the scholar's strife a sinking feeling in my mind and heart.
6. Our differences are the foundation of our greatest strength.
7. I am part of that power which eternally wills evil and eternally works good.
8. As soon as you trust yourself, you will know how to live. Man sees in the world what he carries in his heart.
9. [It] is not an instrument to impel social or political change.”
10. Where did the preposterous premise for this show come from? How did you ever dream it up? Was it a nightmare?
