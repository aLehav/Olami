After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A chilling wind traveled up and over the ridge. It settled in around us as we toasted marshmallows on the crackling campfire that Dad had built using tree bark and pinecones. Collin had suggested we spend the evening on Calling Rock, a small outcrop surrounded on all sides by mountains. If we called out from its jutting surface, our voices reverberated back from all sides, echoing six or seven times before fading out. The granite face of Calling Rock soaked up heat during the summer days and radiated it back as nights set in. We often stargazed up there, the lichen-covered stone warming our backs amidst the cool night air. Dad had been surprised when Collin invited Royella and Aunt Taylor to join us on Calling Rock that evening; I had been nervous.
I had never liked marshmallows, but making s’mores was a welcome distraction, especially when Collin took an audible breath and announced to the group, “We need to talk.”
“No,” I said, elbowing him hard. “We need to stargaze.”
“Listen, Dad,” he said. “I don’t know what’s going on, but I know you’ve been trying to kill owls.”
“What?” Royella said, her voice sharp.
“Smooth,” I mumbled to Collin, though only Dad heard me.
“Oh, don’t you look so shocked.” Collin’s tone filled with hostility as he turned to Royella. “I know about you and Table Mountain.”
“Know what?” she rasped.
“Collin, slow down,” I said, Royella’s visible panic worrying me.
“Listen,” Collin’s voice regained its calm. “The dead owls. The way you’ve been marking trees. You trying to cover up the time spent at Table Mountain. Something weird is going on and we want to know what.” He tried to catch my eye, but I concentrated on peeling the charred outer layer off the gooey center of my marshmallow.
Collin laid out the details that he and I had puzzled over the night before; Dad had been scouting trees in which spotted owls nested and marking them for his fellow forest rangers to cut down. Dad and Taylor had been arguing over their deceased parents’ will. Aunt Taylor’s dog, Button, had been poisoned when he chewed on a spotted owl. Taylor had run into Royella gambling at the casino on the Table Mountain reservation. Ranger Cooper had stopped by to take Royella on a tour of Foxglove’s timber. And I had found a letter addressed jointly to Royella and Aunt Taylor in which an agent from Macksfield Insurance had offered a quote on the value of the property’s trees.
I tried to read the adults’ faces, but I could only understand Collin’s expression. He looked more relieved than he had in a while, and I tried to imitate his relaxed mouth, his calmly focused eyes. A treetop breeze picked up in the distance.
“What’s going on between you two?” Dad finally said, turning to Royella and Taylor. “What’s with the insurance quote?”
“What’s with the owls?” Royella shot back.
I listened to the crackling of pinecones in the fire, to the squeaking of the bats that must have been flying somewhere overhead, to the irritating sound of Royella’s flustered breathing.
I put down my marshmallow stick and nervously began to speak. “Please try to calm down,” I told Royella before turning to Dad. “Listen, Collin and I came up here because we wanted to enjoy the summer with you. But I really hate this whole situation. So can you please just tell us what you’ve been doing?”
“I guess it’s… well it’s complicated,” Dad said, pausing reluctantly.
“But no one’s going to get mad,” I said, encouraging him. When I heard Collin snort, I quickly added, “And if we do, who cares. Isn’t it time for some honesty around here?”
“I think we all want to know what’s going on,” Taylor said, “and I love this place as much as you do. I can start.” She turned to me, unwilling to make eye contact with Dad who sat on her other side. She told us about the time she ran into Royella gambling at Table Mountain, the same story she had once let slip to Collin. She said she didn’t know why Royella had been gambling, but she did know that she had ceased to trust the seemingly devout pastor’s widow after the gambling incident.
The fire danced, flames flickering in the settled dusk and throwing light on Dad’s countenance, his eyes resting on Royella. She looked at her hands.
Taylor continued her story. She had befriended Royella who had suggested that the Foxglove timber could be lucrative. Taylor had gone along with getting a timber quote in order to maintain Royella’s trust and to see what she was planning. She said that she never told Dad because, in the absence of any definitive information to the contrary, he never would have believed that Royella was up to no good.
“Royella,” Dad finally said, “Why get a timber quote?”
“Thanks a lot for that one, Taylor,” Royella said.
“And what about the gambling?” Dad’s voice was soft.
Royella raised her eyes and looked at Dad defiantly. “First things first. I’m not talking about my business at Table Mountain until we discuss the owls.”
“Honestly,” he said, “that was for you.” He held Royella’s gaze.
“Guys,” Collin said as he picked at the crusty lichen growing on the rock beneath us. “Will you just fill us in?”
I sandwiched my marshmallow between two graham crackers and handed it to Taylor, who ate it absentmindedly. Dad and Royella began bickering, each eventually confessing.
Dad had decided he owed it to Royella to earn enough money so that two of them could go somewhere exciting and start fresh. He thought that his unpleasant divorce and the pastor’s legacy made their relationship too difficult in the Sierras. When he became aware that spotted owls inhabited the Foxglove area, he knew that the only source of funds for their new life—the trees that could be logged and turned into cash to finance their adventure—would be valueless if the Forest Service discovered the endangered habitat.
He began searching for spotted owl nests in the national forest surrounding the property, marking the owl-inhabited trees he discovered for the rangers to cut. The pretense of fire safety had successfully covered his underlying motives. Yet, he had no such convenient excuse for cutting down trees with nests on the Foxglove property, as the property was not subject to thinning by forestry workers. Instead, Dad had placed poison in the areas where he found owls. It had been Dad’s poison that killed the owl whose carcass poor little Button had found and chewed.
Royella too, unbeknownst to Dad, had been interested in logging the property. However, she had no intentions of beginning again with him elsewhere. Before her husband had died, the couple had been working on a charity project to build a school at Table Mountain, the Indian reservation and casino where Taylor had run into Royella. They had set up a very successful online contribution page on their church’s website. Unfortunately, with the pastor’s death, the gambling problem Royella had suppressed since the day they had married had flared up again. When her own money had run short, she found herself borrowing from the congregants’ donations for the school. Now the Table Mountain community and the pastor’s congregation were both pressuring her to move forward with building the school, but she had squandered the money she needed to finance it. Desperate, she had contacted an insurance company to learn the value of Foxglove’s trees. Given that Aunt Taylor and Dad had recently been fighting over their parents’ will, she had assumed that Aunt Taylor needed money and would be on board with her plan to log the property and split the cash. The will’s ambiguous wording left open the possibility that Taylor had a legal claim to the property, meaning that even if Dad rejected the logging plans, Taylor might be able to provide authorization. In either case, Dad would receive at least half of the logging money, which Royella knew would then effectively become hers, as the two had become accustomed to sharing expenses and earnings. And if for some reason Dad selfishly hoarded the money, Royella could always marry him.
As the stars came into focus on Calling Rock, the silhouettes of towering pine trees solidified in shape against the night sky. I watched the campfire slowly transform into a pile of glowing embers. For the second time that year, Dad’s plans were smoldering and disintegrating while Collin and I watched.
*
I looked out the window as we took off, the nose of the plane tilting upwards. We gained altitude. The Los Angeles runway disappeared below me, and I closed my eyes, visualizing our return to New York. Rachel and Marissa had made plans for a picnic dinner in Central Park that night, though I wished they had chosen a restaurant. After returning from Foxglove summers, any “natural setting” paled in comparison and made me homesick for the mountains.
Beside me, Dad sat with his eyes closed. He had shaved his beard and dressed in freshly washed jeans with an ironed button-down. Even if Mom wouldn’t agree to take him back, I knew he planned stay in the city. I think I was glad for that.
I wasn’t sure how to find a way to forgive him for his selfish attempt to log Foxglove, and I knew he would never forgive Royella for using him. Royella had assumed that, since they were both at fault, they could just continue the way things were and move forward together with their logging plans. But Royella’s scheme was just the reality check Dad had needed. He had broken up with her, right there under the twinkling stars of Calling Rock. When Royella stood up outraged and asked Collin and me how we could possibly hope that our parents would reconcile after Dad had betrayed us—choosing her, and attempting to destroy the two-hundred-year-old family mountain place for her sake—I had found myself wordless. But Collin, who was absentmindedly stirring the fire’s glowing embers, had quietly told her to leave. We didn’t really know her, he had explained, and Dad was family.
I leaned against the airplane window, shifting my body and trying to find a comfortable position. The patterned blue fabric of my seat looked new, as if the plane had recently been reupholstered. I thought of the duct tape-patched seats of Dad’s Chevy and wondered whether the government would hire a new ranger to take his truck, fill his place. Maybe not. Perhaps the drought would end soon and there would be less work, less concern that so much as a stray ember could cause a fire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 18, 2014, at 6:01 p.m.
Following a report that Harvard University Dining Services had suspended purchases of soda water machines from an Israeli company associated with an international settlement dispute, University President Drew G. Faust has requested an investigation into the decision, according to Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Last spring, HUDS stopped purchasing SodaStream water machines following complaints from members of the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society, who raised concerns to administrators that the appliances could offend Palestinian students. The company’s main factory is currently located in the West Bank, a site of conflict over land ownership between Israel and Palestine. The company recently announced plans to move the factory to another location.
“Harvard University's procurement decisions should not and will not be driven by individuals' views of highly contested matters of political controversy,” Garber wrote in an emailed statement in response to the report of the decision shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday. “If this policy is not currently known or understood in some parts of the University, that will be rectified now."
Garber wrote that neither he nor Faust was aware of the decision and the circumstances surrounding it until The Crimson reported the details late Tuesday evening.
Although she did not return a request for comment by early Thursday afternoon, HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin previously confirmed that the dining service agreed to remove SodaStream labels from machines it had already purchased and buy future appliances from other companies after the students raised their complaints in meetings with administrators.
Reached early Thursday morning, University spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to clarify whether or not the University considers the HUDS decision a policy violation.
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers, however, said in an interview early Thursday that the decision, as reported, “is entirely inconsistent with the University's longstanding policy of not politicizing its procurement and divestment decisions.”
Several student activists responded to Garber’s statement with comments of their own on Thursday. Alexander M. Abbasi, a student at Harvard Divinity School and a member of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, reiterated criticism of SodaStream in an emailed statement early Thursday morning, emphasizing that student activists “took the necessary civil measures to be in touch” with relevant administrators to voice their concerns.
“We are thankful to the Harvard administration who worked with us, and took the necessary civil measures to hear the concerns of Palestinian and other Harvard students,” he wrote.
Leaders of several Jewish and pro-Israel student organizations, meanwhile, expressed their support for the investigation into the decision to suspend the SodaStream purchases in a joint statement Thursday.
“We regret that neither we nor the greater student body were included in the conversation. We stand strongly against efforts to boycott and delegitimize the State of Israel,” reads the statement, signed by Harvard Hillel President Samuel M. Fisher ’15, Harvard Students for Israel President and Vice President Yoav Shaked '17 and Moriya Blumenfeld '16, and Israel Public Affairs Committee at Harvard College President Edyt J. Dickstein '17. Dickstein is also a Crimson editorial writer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 18, 2014, at 11:28 p.m.
In the face of criticism over a spring decision to suspend purchases from an Israeli soda water company with a presence in the West Bank, a Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson wrote in a statement Thursday that HUDS  “mistakenly factored political concerns” into the controversial decision.
“As the President and Provost have made clear, our procurement decisions should not be driven by community members’ views on matters of political controversy,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an email.
Last spring, HUDS suspended its purchase of water machines from soda water company SodaStream, whose primary factory is currently located in the West Bank, following complaints raised by members of the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee and the Harvard Islamic Society that the appliances could offend Palestinian students.
University President Drew G. Faust requested an investigation into the decision in response to learning of the decision to suspend purchases of the machines from The Crimson this week, and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote a statement reiterating the University’s stance against basing purchasing decisions on political considerations.
“Harvard University's procurement decisions should not and will not be driven by individuals' views of highly contested matters of political controversy,” Garber wrote Wednesday in an email. “If this policy is not currently known or understood in some parts of the University, that will be rectified now."
In the past, Faust has argued against using Harvard’s endowment for political purposes in issues such as divesting from fossil fuel companies.
This is not the first time that HUDS has made purchasing decisions in response to political concerns. In 2013, the dining service stopped serving Barilla pasta after the company’s chairperson told an Italian radio station that the company would not feature gay families in its advertising.
Andrew W. Schutts ’16, a member of the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, expressed disappointment with HUDS’ statement Thursday, writing in an email that he was “devastated that HUDS has rejected the progress that was made last semester” on the SodaStream issue.
“A lot of people maybe think it’s just a soda machine, it’s not a huge deal, it shouldn’t be politicized, but for a lot of students at Harvard, this is a huge deal that’s significantly related to their experience at the University,” he added.
Still, earlier Thursday, students from several Jewish and pro-Israel organizations criticized HUDS’ original decision to suspend purchases from SodaStream, arguing that their groups had been left out of the decision-making process.
“Our main reaction was frustration, or I guess disappointment, over the fact that we were not included in the conversation that had happened, even though it is an issue that is close to our hearts,” said Samuel M. Fisher ’15, the outgoing president of Harvard Hillel.

Korean pop star Psy is in an elite club of artists with over one billion views on YouTube for his hit song “Gangnam Style.” However, earlier this month he became a member of an even more exclusive club. That’s right, the Harvard Club of Korea made Psy an honorary member for his contributions towards “raising awareness of Korea around the world.”
Psy’s love affair with Harvard started back in May of 2013, when he gave a speech at Memorial Church about his career as a singer and the success of “Gangnam Style.” Nearly 800 students attended his talk, during which he shared funny anecdotes, such as the time he had a bad case of diarrhea. At the end of his talk, he gave everyone a free boxed Korean dinner as a form of thanks for coming out the night before the first day of finals– we see you, Psy, gaining the affections of Harvard students maxed out on swai and golden nuggets.
Though Psy actually studied at Boston University and Berklee College of Music and said that Harvard “felt a universe away” during his collegiate days, he can now attend swanky Harvard networking events and alumni parties as a member of the Harvard Club. Take that celebrity parties!
However, it turns out that you don’t need two billion views on youtube to be invited to join the Harvard Club of Korea—according to the organization’s website, “all members of the Harvard community” can become a part of the club. Although we at Flyby are very tempted to join so we can network with Psy and snag some free YouTube advice, we’ll wait until he announces dancing classes before buying a full membership.
