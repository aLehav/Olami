After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Sunday, a day before her twenty-eighth birthday, Maggie Rogers (who is currently a member of the class of 2022 at Harvard Divinity School) received one of the greatest possible presents: the opportunity to perform on the Coachella mainstage. In return, she gifted her audience with forty-five minutes of pure vocal perfection.
Rogers opened with the infectiously danceable “Give A Little,” the first track from her 2019 debut album “Heard It In A Past Life.” Immediately, the audience knew they were in for a treat. During the verses, Rogers sang at the upper end of her chest voice with perfect tone — a feat which is by no means easy, especially with clouds of Coachella Valley dust filling up the air. During the chorus, the bass guitar and drums worked together to create an irresistible groove that perfectly synced up with Rogers’ lyrics.
Moving on to “Retrograde,” Rogers continued her exhibition of vocal prowess. Notably, she maintained perfect control of her vocals despite the difficult range of the chorus, which transitions back and forth from chest voice to falsetto. Adding a fresh twist to the song, the band blended the chords into Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” which had a similar tonal structure to “Retrograde.” In a Houston-esque manner, Rogers’ large vocal range allowed her to do the iconic track justice. As the band played a funky beat, she belted the lyrics and basked under the desert sun.
Trying something new, Rogers announced she would be performing an unreleased track entitled “Want Want.” The song featured heavy guitar and a catchy chorus. “If you want, want what you want, want then you want it,” Rogers sang. This offered a sneak peek into her upcoming album July 29 “Surrender,” an album that is shaping up to be as good or even better than “Heard It In A Past Life,” if “Want Want” is any indication of its quality.
Despite the surging temperature and dwindling energy on the third day of the festival, Rogers winded up the audience with an “Are you ready to dance?” as 2019’s “Say It” began to play. She skipped across the stage and swayed along with the groove, oftentimes walking over to her guitar player and head-banging with him.
The true beauty of Rogers’ performance lay in her entrancing voice: One could listen to her sing for hours and never get tired of her deep, rich timbre. Thanks to a new arrangement of 2016’s “Alaska”— the song which first boosted her into the limelight — her voice became the primary focus of the track. She began a capella, gracefully singing,“I was walking through icy streams that took my breath away.” Slowly, the drums and electric guitar joined her, but just enough to uplift her crystalline vocals. Despite a few malfunctioning pixels on the LED screen behind her, the performance proved a moment of perfection.
Following this impactful rendition, Rogers performed her most famous song “Light On.” Hands in the air, the audience sang the words to the chorus, and a vibrant smile lit up Rogers’ face.
Ending with the same energy she opened her set with, Rogers performed another new song from her upcoming album. The April 8 single, entitled “That’s Where I Am,” was rock-infused, yet it maintained the same vocal sweetness which sets Rogers apart from her fellow artists. Over heavy electric guitar strumming, Rogers serenaded the crowd with her tone. Extending the song’s outro, she reprised the chorus and showed off her talent one final time, leaving it all on the stage.
Although the sun continued to beat down during the hottest part of the hottest day of Coachella’s second weekend, Rogers’ stage presence could only be described as cool and refreshing.

As fans flooded the main stage of the Coachella Music Festival to see pop superstar Doja Cat, it was clear they were anticipating nothing short of an awe-inspiring performance the Los Angeles singer is known to deliver. What they didn’t know, however, was that they were about to see the wackiest, most energetic, and overall best act of the final day.
From the beginning of the night’s set, Doja Cat exceeded all expectations and became the queen of the stage. Opening with the hypnotic “Woman,” she set into a funky beat and joined in on intricate choreography with her background dancers. When the rap section of the song came around, she enunciated every word with confidence and sass, not even pausing to catch her breath. Accompanied by a full band on stage, the live performances of her songs allowed her rapping abilities to reach new heights.
Most notably, the set was — for all intents and purposes — a rock concert. TikTok superhit “Say So,” which is known for its lighthearted, playful groove, opened with a heavy-metal guitar solo with the likes of a Metallica riff. Doja Cat rose up onto the stage from a trapdoor wearing a leather harness, and, as the music stopped, sang, “It’s been a long time since you / Fell in love.” It was at this moment that the rendition became recognizable, proof of Doja Cat’s chameleon flair. The chorus featured heavy bass drum and electric guitar improvisation, and Doja Cat belted the lyrics as opposed to the softness of the studio album version. Instead of rapping the verses, she shouted the words in an emo-punk manner, which only added to the shock value of the performance.
Following “Say So,” Rico Nasty walked onto the stage for a surprise performance, wearing a spiked leather collar and spiked sleeves. Together, the pair sang a rock version of their 2019 collaboration “Tia Tamera.” Heavy synth tones blasted from the speakers, and again the electric guitar player improvised on stage. This time, the music stopped and allowed for a drum solo, which drove the audience wild. Expecting a pop concert, the Doja Cat’s massive audience received a spectacle of beautiful madness instead.
In addition to these updated renditions of her music, Doja Cat’s concert was rife with all of the quirky personality her fans love. These unique Doja-isms shone exceptionally well through the costume design on display throughout the show. During “Get Into It (Yuh)” from 2021’s critically acclaimed “Planet Her,” for example, four-legged mythical creatures creepily crawled on stage and weaved through the background dancers. Later, during “Go to Town,” background dancers walked out wearing bright-green fuzzy ponchos which looked straight from the set of “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.” Among the few times Doja Cat spoke to the audience, she stood atop a thirty-foot-tall spiral staircase and said, “I like you guys. You guys are cool.”
This being said, her set was by no means solely a performative spectacle. Specifically during “Alone,” Doja Cat's raspy, sweet voice shined through. During this slower track, she got down on her knees and focused on her vocal execution. Staring off into the crowd, she slowly swayed to the bass guitar beat and sang, “Is it crazy I’m not scared to be alone?”
More than any other performance on Sunday, Doja Cat’s set was endlessly entertaining. With five costume changes, crazy set design, and two guest artists (Tyga also appeared for a surprise song), it was impossible to know what was going to happen next. The vibes of the show shifted anywhere from sexy and flirtatious to angry and intense, which not only made for a dynamic concert experience but also demonstrated the breadth of range in the rapper’s music.
Coachella also meant the debut of two new songs, “Vegas” and “Shots.” Both tracks featured the hip hop and pop fusion characteristic of Doja Cat’s music, yet each one possessed a unique production which distinguished their artistry. “Vegas,” from the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann’s upcoming biopic “Elvis,” included soul samples and smoother R&B vocals, whereas “Shots” — Doja Cat’s encore — was a high-energy, intense, rock-adjacent track. As the electric guitar blasted, Doja Cat said, “I brought the fucking Mexican pizza back” and exited stage left.
Doja Cat entertained, wowed, and gave the performance of a lifetime. Although The Weeknd, joined by Swedish House Mafia, gave a sufficient performance to close out the night, the 100-minute time slot at the end of the night could have just as easily been reserved for Doja Cat.
After Ye dropped out of the festival, there was no need to search for an outside artist. Sunday’s headliner was there in plain sight, singing, “Bitch, I’m a cow.”

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 will address Harvard College’s Class of 2022 at this year’s Class Day on May 25, the University announced Wednesday.
Wu, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, was elected mayor of Boston last fall, making her the first woman and person of color to be elected as the city’s mayor. In 2013, she made history after becoming the first Asian-American woman to be elected to the Boston City Council.
Wu said in a press release that she was “deeply honored” to speak at this year’s Class Day ceremony.
"I’m deeply honored to join this year’s graduating seniors for Class Day, returning to campus with fond memories and fresh excitement,” Wu said. “It’s an inspiration to see the activism and accomplishment represented across this class, and I look forward to cheering their leadership for years to come.”
As city councilor, Wu passed legislation for paid parental leave, housing stability, and workers’ rights. Wu also outlined a Green New Deal for Boston, a staple of her platform for mayor.
As a student at the College, Wu concentrated in Economics and lived in Currier House. Outside of her studies, she sang soprano in the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus and led the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Chinatown Citizenship Program, which provides support and classes for Chinatown immigrants in the naturalization process.
Wu also attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2012, and has served on the Senior Advisory Committee of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics since 2019.
The College’s Senior Class Committee, composed of senior class marshals, annually selects a Class Day speaker to address the graduating class. Professional basketball player Jeremy Lin ’10 addressed the Class of 2021 virtually last year.
Second marshal and speaker selection committee co-chair Ruth H. M. Jaensubhakij ’22 described Wu as an “inspiring leader” and “fierce defender of equity, inclusion, and opportunity.”
“Mayor Wu has worked tirelessly for a Boston that supports everyone and that will continue to be a model of excellence for the world,” Jaensubhakij said in the press release. “As we graduate, we are fortunate to be able to learn from her experiences and her leadership, especially at a time when community engagement is more important than ever.”
After two years of virtual festivities, this year marks the first in-person Class Day since 2019. The University-wide graduation ceremony, featuring remarks from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, will take place the following day on May 26.

The Harvard men’s and women’s skiing teams had a strong showing this past season despite a year away from competition due to the pandemic.
The Crimson, led by junior nordic skier James Kitch and first-year alpine skier Matt Ryan, finished in the top 30 in every event at the recent 2022 NCAA Skiing Championships. Ryan was the first alpine skier to qualify for the championships since P.A. Weiner in 1988, and he was accompanied by Kitch, who overcame an injury in the fall to become one of the top scorers for the Crimson.
Kitch qualified for the NCAA Championships in each of his first three years at Harvard and has been a steady presence all season long.
“I’ve always been impressed with [Kitch’s] ability to match the stage he’s performing on, and he did that again at NCAAs, where he put down his best races of the year,” said nordic head coach Chris City.
Overall, both the men’s and women’s teams displayed great depth and potential for the years to come.
“I expect to book reservations for the NCAA championships annually moving forward,” said alpine head coach Scott MacPherson.“It’s hard to pick out one single athlete from our program, as the season was a true team effort.”
Alpine senior captain Nellie Ide played a huge role for the Crimson, with her leadership setting the tone for the team. Ide’s incredible four year tenure as team captain helped pave the way for the team’s success. Her leadership on and off the slopes has proven to be invaluable.
In spite of numerous injuries, there were still bright spots for the team. Junior Emma Ryan and sophomore Elsie Halvorsen had career best seasons for Harvard. Halvorsen placed 13th in the giant slalom at her first ever collegiate event, and Ryan came in 15th in the slalom at the 2022 Saint Michael’s Carnival and at the Dartmouth Carnival.
Nordic co-captains Everett Sapp and Ursula Volz were also vital to the team’s success this season, proving to be consistent scorers and remarkable leaders.

The Crimson has a bright future ahead with first years Quincy Donley and Mads Groeholdt. Donley earned points in almost every race, and Groeholdt barely narrowly missed qualifying for the NCAA Championships.
“It’s exciting when young skiers are pushing the pace for us, and I’m already looking forward to what they can do next year,” coach City said.
Nordic skier Rémi Drolet is also set to return for the Crimson next season after taking a leave of absence to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics as a member of the Canadian cross-country skiing team. He helped lead Canada to an 11th place finish, placing 33rd in the 15km classic and 35th in the 50km mass start.

“Two years ago, he was a first-year in the van to practice — and then there he was racing in front of the whole world,” coach City remembered. I’m excited to work with Rémi again next year, and I know he’s really looking forward to picking back up with his academics and the community here.”
Coach City has an incredibly positive outlook for the coming year.
“We have a strong returning team, as well as a talented pair of incoming first-years, and I see it as an opportunity to build on what we learned this year,” City said. “I’d hope to see us qualify a full men’s team (three skiers) to NCAAs for the first time ever.”
There is much to be excited about for this remarkable team, and there is no doubt that Harvard will  continue to set the standard of excellence next winter.
