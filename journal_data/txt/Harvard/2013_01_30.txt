After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chris Brown throws punches like it's going out of style. Last Sunday, the irreverent R&B singer beefed with Frank Ocean—whose debut album "channel ORANGE" wowed critics last year—over a parking space outside of Westlake Studio in Los Angeles. Brown has previously exchanged fisticuffs—and bottles—with former "Degrassi: The Next Generation" star Drake in a New York nightclub. Like an active volcano or a Kardashian sex tape scandal, it seems the question with Brown isn't whether he will strike again, but when. As a public safety precaution, the Arts blog has provided a list of the top five people Brown is most likely to fight next. You have been forewarned.
1. Wiz Khalifa
Brown has already beat down the top three people in Ghostface Killah's "Top 10 Softest Rappers in the Game" list, and Wiz Khalifa is next up at number four. If Brown is going for a high score, he has to go through Khalifa.
2. Dick Cheney
Our trigger-happy former vice president is known for several things, including his steadfast refusal to acknowledge climate change as a real problem. On the other hand, in his opus "Big Booty Judy," Brown argues persuasively that he is indeed feeling a perceptible increase in temperature: "Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant / Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been." This could be a showdown of epic proportions, unless Cheney shoots Brown in the face first.
3. Betty White
This one probably isn't that likely, but if it does happen, let's hope it's on the set of "Hot in Cleveland."
4. Lindsay Lohan
The former child star is known for two things: her fiery temper and her love of free parking. Brown's latest incident only goes to show just how scarce parking is in Los Angeles is, and it's frightening to think what would happen if these two firebrands tried to pull into the same spot at the same time.
5. Chris Brown
Brown hates it when people get all up in his grill, and no one has shown more skill at sticking his nose where it doesn't belong than Brown himself. One of these days, Brown might just teach himself a lesson in minding his own business.

Harvard is renowned for its illustrious professors, rich history, old campus, and, apparently, food. According to the new episode of "Family Guy" entitled "The Giggity Wife," which aired on Sunday, the oldest Ivy should really be known for having breakfast food for dinner; Peter and the crew decide to visit because "they got fancy food up at Harvard."
(Seriously, what is it with the food? Is there something the rest of the world sees that we're missing?)
Harvard doesn't feature too heavily in the episode—their visit functions only as an introduction to a "Hangover"-esque escapade through Boston. After a depiction of (a surprisingly accurate) Annenberg Hall—not a Harry Potter joke to be found—the episode dives into a series of tasteless gags involving Asian people and Helen Keller. A few infamous alumni and a Winklevoss twin later, the characters decide that "low-def" Boston is far superior to its academic cousin.
The episode may not pay much attention to us, but at least it has eternally erudite Peter Griffin claiming that he's at "Harvard, the smartest school in the country." We'll take it.

For the first time in the history of the U.S. military, women will be allowed to serve in combat alongside their male counterparts without any gender-based discrimination. Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta made the historic announcement last Thursday, effectively lifting the ban on women serving in ground combat roles. By rescinding the ban, the military is taking a crucial and long-awaited step to align itself with core American ideals of equality. Furthermore, a fully inclusive military will allow for the most talented service members to be recruited without taking their gender into account, thereby improving the quality of the military.
Historically, the contributions of the women in the U.S. military have been devalued by an institutionalized gender bias against them. The specific ban that is being rescinded was established in 1994 restricting women from serving on the frontlines of the battlefield.  Not only did this prevent capable women from serving their country to their fullest capacity, but the lack of battlefield experience also inhibited women from rising up the ranks in the military to the same degree as men.
However, particularly over the last 10 years of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, women have proven their value time and time again. Although they weren’t officially allowed to serve in combat roles, the reality of the battlefield in these theaters of war led to women often being drawn into combat. Their performance in these situations convinced Secretary of Defense Panetta and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey, that there was no longer any reason to proscribe women from serving in these roles.
In the past few days most people have welcomed the change. However, a few have continued to speak out against women in combat. Among the opposition is Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who said that the committee might “introduce legislation to stop any changes we believe to be detrimental to our fighting forces and their capabilities.”  Those that oppose the ban have echoed the Senator’s sentiment, suggesting that any gains in equality in the military would be overshadowed by a decrease in effectiveness. Although the transition to opening more high-level roles to women will surely not come without any obstacles, the opposition’s argument is baseless because the evaluation for these new positions will be gender neutral. Thus women and men will be held to the same standards.
All the branches of the military will proceed in developing plans to phase in women by May 15 of this year. Although the initial stages of this new era of equality in the military surely won’t be free of unforeseen consequences, overall we should welcome this change as one that will not only allow our military to realize the full potential of its members, but also to achieve a level of equality that reflects the ideals of our country.

Rare is the elected official who maintains his or her support for term limits after actually winning the job, a fact evidenced by the paltry number of co-sponsors on the amendment introduced by Pat J. Toomey ’84 at the beginning of this Congress. To the surprise of no one, these advocates are (almost) all newly elected Republicans, the demographic in the Senate with the least to lose from imposing limitations that would most immediately affect their more senior colleagues (perhaps putting some Democratic-held seats in play). While it is easy to mask political expediency sub specie boni, politicians of all stripes should embrace the principle of term limits, regardless of its impact on their career intentions.
The argument against term limits is so well known that it has become axiomatic. Such restrictions on the membership of legislative bodies, it is insisted, would eliminate officials just as they’ve grown knowledgeable about key issues and influential among their peers. Term limits also would be anathema to democracy, as they necessarily restrict the choices present to voters. “We already have term limits,” opponents assert, dutifully providing a civics lesson to the 75 percent of Americans that support curbing the amount of time their leaders can spend living off their dime. “They’re called elections!”
Anyone who makes this latter argument has either a jejune understanding of political science or, more plausibly, is an elected official himself. Only a starry-eyed tyro to the workings of the world could possibly contend with a straight face that elections currently provide citizens with the unrestrained ability to choose new representatives. After all, the advantage of incumbency is well documented throughout American history. To see it, one need look no further than the past election, when over three-fourths of those in Congress were reelected, despite the body’s 9 percent approval rating—a figure making it less popular than colonoscopies, used car salesmen, and lice. As it turns out, it is a lot easier to run for office when your living expenses are already footed by Uncle Sam.
The other argument in opposition to term limits is more difficult to discredit. The notion that a politician gets better at his job the longer he does it is intuitive—that’s true of every professional. However, one has to remember that public service is not just any profession but rather the embodiment of governing principles. Term limits would downplay the role of individuals’ influence in the legislative bodies. Do we really want our laws to be determined by which states have delegations most likely to be found in a Georgetown geriatric ward?
For years, Hawaii held outsize sway in the Senate due to the high positions held by superannuated veterans Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye, the latter of which had represented the islands since they achieved statehood in 1959. While citizens of the 11th-least populous state did not bemoan the importance of influence in Congress at any point during the last half-century, the simultaneity of Inouye’s death and Akaka’s retirement has put them in the precarious position in which no one in their entire Congressional delegation has served for longer than two years. This could pose a bit of an issue for the state that currently receives the fourth-most taxpayer dollars.
Opponents of term limits often paint the picture of a hapless naïf with big dreams walking into Congress unable to deal with the diversity and subtlety of issues that the experienced professionals have spent years learning. Again this viewpoint is both too idealistic and fundamentally dishonest about the real-world apparatus of the legislative branch of the United States government. Members of Congress do not live in some cloistered world, à la the Supreme Court, in which the ideas manifest in their policy proposals are purely their own. Rather, they turn to staff lawyers to craft bills on issues they want to support. Most don’t even read the bills they are supposed to be making informed decisions on. This is not because they are congressional tenderfoots, but rather because the current proceedings do not provide enough time to carefully examine the thousands of bills introduced each year.
The reason that term limit legislation continually dies in Congress is obvious. It is poison hemlock, and, unfortunately, so few of our elected officials are veritable Socratics. Too many politicians look at Congress as a way to increase their statuses and pad their pocketbooks. The argument that the Methuselahs of D.C. are the only ones who can tackle the nation’s problems is a sophomoric one. We manage to find a new and capable president every eight years; there is no reason we can’t find fresh blood from each state to protect the nation’s interests. Besides, it’s not like there isn’t already a professional government class in the district ready to help the newbies out.

This month, five states announced that they are considering joining Maine and Nebraska in apportioning electoral votes in presidential elections by congressional district, rather than by the current winner-takes-all setup. If these changes had been made prior to November’s election, President Obama would have won by a margin of only 30 electoral votes rather than his actual 126. If all 50 states went by this “proportional” method, Mitt Romney would be our current president, having won the 2012 election 277 to 261. This doesn’t mean Romney had majority support behind him—he only managed an appropriate 47 percent of the popular vote. His hypothetical victory is a result of weirdly shaped gerrymandered districts synthesized by Republican legislatures to always go red. Only a handful of people seriously want to extend the horrors of gerrymandering to presidential elections (though this handful includes Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus) but this does raise the question: What national election process could best replace the Electoral College? This in turn raises a more apposite question: Why are we trying to get rid of the Electoral College in the first place?
America’s unique method of electing a president has had its share of opponents throughout the years, and it’s time we gave it a break. An overwhelming majority of criticisms of the system are invalid, and the ones that are valid are, well, not too terrible. Perhaps most importantly, a switch is politically infeasible, as the necessary constitutional amendment would undoubtedly be blocked by the smaller states. We should only be talking about reform if we find some incontrovertibly superior option, and the most popular alternative—the aptly named popular vote—has even more problems. All things considered, the Electoral College is okay.
A favorite complaint of reform proponents argues that the Electoral College doesn’t care who the most popular candidate is and elects a president that might not reflect the will of a plurality of U.S. citizens. This is admittedly true, in the same way that Congress can enact a law without popular support and the President can appoint a Cabinet member opposed by a majority of Americans. The Constitution outlines a representative democracy, so it’s not a failing of our elections if we don’t follow the rules of direct democracy—it’s a clear sign we’re doing something right.
Some of the College’s more inventive opponents like concocting outlandish hypotheticals to stress the irrelevance of public opinion in the system today. Yes, it’s possible for a candidate to become president with about 22 percent of the popular vote (by winning a collection of small states by one vote each and losing the rest unanimously). Yes, it’s possible for a candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election 535 to 3 (by winning Wyoming by 51 votes and losing every other state and D.C. by one vote). It’s also possible, and far more statistically likely, for a candidate to be fatally struck by a bale of cocaine falling from a drug-smuggling plane. So let’s stick to our empirical examples: In 53 out of 57 elections the Electoral College has elected the plurality’s favorite.
Another common criticism bemoans the focus on the select few swing states with the statistical potential to decide the election. But this doesn’t acknowledge that the focus on swing states is a good thing. No specific state is favored by this approach: Preference is only given to states with the greatest political diversity at the time of the election. This tempers the political dialogue between the two parties, forcing them to appeal to the center rather than play up fringe interests that would only get them more votes in already solid states. Under a popular vote scenario, candidates would have to cater toward big cities—not exactly bastions of centrism—and systematically disenfranchise suburban and rural voters.
A final notable objection to the Electoral College is that it marginalizes third-party candidates, who have very little hope of carrying even a single state, let alone winning the presidency. While this is true, people seem to think this means any position not currently taken by either party has no chance of ever becoming national policy. All it really means is that a stance has to be adopted by one of the two major parties to become an issue in an election, essentially needing the support of over a quarter of Americans (a crass estimate, for sure) to be seriously considered on a national stage. Under the popular vote, third-party candidates supporting fringe positions rejected by both parties would distract from the issues with more widespread appeal. Imagine a segregationist candidate running in a 21st century election, thus granting airtime and legitimacy to a now generally rejected position. This could be devastating to the political process. So can we drop this popular vote reform business and get angry about things that matter?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s winter break is a long one. In 2012, the last fall term exam took place on December 20, with classes resuming this Monday, 39 days later. For many Harvard undergraduates, the lengthy respite means more time spent with the family and friends. For some it means travel to other continents; for others, more earnings and work experience. And for a swelling subsection of Harvard undergraduates, it means more hours spent absorbing the pixelated plot of a television show. It means more binge-watching.
The Los Angeles Times defines binge television as “any instance in which more than three episodes of an hourlong drama or six episodes of a half-hour comedy are consumed at one sitting.” The phenomenon extends well beyond the college campus. Primary binge-watching enabler Netflix registered 27.1 million domestic subscribers for its online streaming program as of December 31, up two million in the fourth quarter. In fact, its better-than-expected growth has helped drive the NFLX stock value out of the doldrums, with a 42 percent jump just last Thursday. And while the service has added users, its viewers have also become more intensive—television shows watched per week have risen 38 percent for Netflix customers since 2009, The Wall Street Journal reports.
As might be expected, the rise of binge-watching has met with its share of negative reception, and the name surely doesn’t help. The word “binge” carries a pejorative sting, conjuring phrases such as “binge-eating,” “binge-drinking,” and “spending binge.” The word, per Dictionary.com, denotes “excess,” but not a positive sort—we have no “generosity binge” or “binge-caring.” Binge is bad, not supererogatory. And beneath that basic PR problem, binge-watching consists of prolonged, passive stagnation in front of a screen, a difficult activity (or inactivity) to defend with much gusto.
But television has endured those complaints since its inception. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average American spends 2.75 hours watching TV every day, with television surpassed only by the biological necessities of sleeping and eating (and not mutually exclusive with the latter). Maybe we need to reevaluate behavior (or simply pick up a book on occasion), but television-watching is a form of leisure, and although the prolonged sitting during binge-watching can lead long-term health issues, that offers a common-sense argument for occasional pauses, not against stringing shows together.
Much more worth discussing is the commentary that centers on aesthetics, specifically the shift in viewing experience that binge-watching has produced. Binge-watching has reduced the time between episodes from a week to mere seconds—which can even be counted down during the credits, if you let Netflix’s “post play” feature automatically start the next episode for you. An article last July from Slate Magazine sees this as a negative because “episodes have their own integrity, which is blurred by watching several in a row.” True, almost all television shows are designed for weekly viewership, but a similar complaint might be levied against the move away from serialization of the novel. And nineteenth century literature isn’t read today with month- or week-long pauses, despite some advantages to the old practice. Readers of Dostoyevsky’s Brothers Karamazov, for instance, were left to ruminate for a month on his great challenge to the divine, “The Grand Inquisitor,” before the author’s counterarguments appeared in print. Yet one of the unique qualities of the novel is the reader’s control of its pace; binge-watching allows TV viewers a bit more control, too.
Of course, most serialized novels were written with an eye toward eventual publication in full, but a similar impulse has hit TV shows. The former Fox show “Arrested Development,” kept relevant in part through binge-watching, plans an upcoming Netflix-exclusive season to be released—and consumed—in bulk. And even serialized shows are keeping down-the-road viewers in mind: “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan has suggested that binge-watchers may be “more rewarded” by the intricacies of plot he has worked to integrate. Another creator, David Simon, of HBO’s “The Wire,” which left the air in 2008, has expressed (and later clarified) “amused contempt” for latecomer binge-viewers. But “The Wire” in particular with its ornate webs of characters and season-long plot arcs, has showcased the unique offerings of post-serial life.  “It was conceived of as a whole, and we did it as a whole,” Simon has said. That idea left the show languishing with low ratings while it ran on air—but flourishing when binge-viewers discovered it.
This isn’t to call binge-watching unequivocally better than the old serialized system. But it is something distinct and worth appreciating. And it is fascinating. The modern age, as commenters so often lament, is a condensed, quick world. The average presidential election TV sound bite has slipped from 43 seconds in 1968 to under eight seconds of late. Thoughts face 140-character caps. And we are impatient: 32 percent of internet consumers will abandon slow sites after one to five seconds of delay. And yet, in the midst of this new, ballyhooed cultural norm, in the form of binge-watching, a shift persists toward decelerating and maintaining focus. If nothing else, we have finally found a way to sit still.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and student supporters protested outside of Massachusetts Hall all day on Tuesday to urge the University to agree to favorable terms in continuing contract negotiations.
The previous contract between the University and HUCTW—which represents more than 4,600 non-faculty Harvard staff—expired July 1 of last year. Because the two sides have been unable to agree on the details of the new contract, the old contract is still in effect. The two largest points of disagreement in the negotiations involve salary increases and health care benefits.
“The salary increase that the University is holding us at is not good enough,” Linda Kluz, Communications Coordinator at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, said. “It doesn’t even meet the rise in the cost of living.”
At 5:30 p.m., 20 protesters stood outside Mass. Hall, holding signs bearing the message “Invest in the Staff.” Protesters were present all day Tuesday starting at 8:30 a.m., and the group plans to protest at the same time every Tuesday and Thursday until the negotiations are resolved.
“The University is for all of us,” said Susan M. Kinsella, an administrative coordinator in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department who is also on the executive board of HUCTW. “We don’t want anything except for what we think we deserve as outstanding staff members that help keep the University going.”
In a statement released on Sept. 27, 2012, the University said that wage offers made by the University in negotiations with HUCTW were “clearly consistent with the internal and external job markets.”
The University also said in that statement that its pay to HUCTW members was “very competitive” according to benchmark comparisons with the external market.
People walking through the Yard stopped to speak with the protesters, to learn more about the contract negotiations, or to voice their support.
The Student Labor Action Movement has organized a Solidarity Hour from 4 to 5 p.m. every Tuesday and Thursday, during which SLAM members will stand with the protesters to show their support for the union’s stance in the contract negotiations.
“The lack of respect and dignity for workers is outrageous, especially in a country that has so much prosperity,” Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16, a member of SLAM, said. “It’s very upsetting for me to be a part of a community where workers are being treated in such ways, so I’m doing everything I can to change that fact.”
Other students got involved in the HUCTW protests through the Unite Harvard Wintersession program, which focused on progressive action and activism at Harvard and was sponsored by 14 different student groups. Participants in the program joined the first HUCTW protest last Tuesday.
“I’m standing in solidary with all the HUCTW workers because it makes me angry that Harvard isn’t trying to negotiate,” said Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who participated in Unite Harvard.

UPDATED: January 30, 2013, at 4:40 p.m.
The Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs announced Tuesday that Dr. Gary S. Samore, White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism under President Barack Obama, has been tapped to lead the center as its executive director. He will assume the position on Monday.
“Gary Samore is an outstanding choice for the Belfer Center executive director position,” said Samore’s predecessor, Army Brigadier General Kevin Ryan. “He has exceptional academic credentials and experience in leading research institutions and of course he is a distinguished alumnus of the Belfer Center.”
Samore worked briefly at the Belfer Center after graduating with a Ph.D. in government from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1984. Since then, he has held a variety of research and governmental posts and has worked for both the Clinton and Obama administrations.
“Gary Samore is the very model of a Belfer Center professional,” Center Director Graham T. Allison ’62 said in a press release. “We count ourselves fortunate that one of the nation’s leaders in both thought and action on the core issues of the Center’s agenda will bring his rich experience to our community.”
In the Obama White House, Samore advised the president on matters concerning arms control, WMD proliferation, and terrorism.  His position under President Obama came after he played a key role in negotiating the end of North Korea’s nuclear program as President Bill Clinton’s Special Assistant and Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls at the National Security Council.
Samore continued his negotiation efforts under President Obama, helping to contract the New START arms control agreement with Russia. His Obama-era resume also includes efforts to battle terrorism and quash Iranian nuclear ambitions.
When he arrives in Cambridge, Samore’s obligations will be more academic in nature. Along with co-chairing the Iran Nuclear Negotiations Working Group and managing and advising the Belfer Center’s research plans, he will also conduct his own research.
After Samore assumes his position, Ryan will preside over new programs on defense and intelligence at the Belfer Center. Ryan expressed optimism about the prospect of Samore’s return.
“We’re excited to have him back,” Ryan said.

With the Science Center Plaza construction project approaching completion on schedule, Harvard officials are touting the space’s potential to become a bustling communal gathering area.
About eight months after construction began last May, workers have now completed many of the planned surface improvements outside the Science Center and opened additional pathways across the plaza, which is now almost fully paved with gray stone. Paver installation and trucking will continue throughout this month, according to the Harvard University Construction Mitigation website.
Most of the major construction work is expected to be finished by April in time for the annual Arts First festival, University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an emailed statement. Construction is expected to be completely wrapped up by the summer of 2013, a target date in accordance with the timeline that administrators previously laid out for the project.
The construction project, a partnership between Harvard and the City of Cambridge, is taking place alongside a city effort to make utility infrastructure improvements to the Cambridge Street tunnel’s roof and drainage system.
The University integrated the Science Center Plaza project into its Common Spaces initiative, aimed at further developing campus areas where members of the Harvard community can come together.
According to Marshall, “the goal of the Science Center Plaza project is to improve pedestrian and bike access and to create a space that is inviting, usable, flexible and a destination for both the campus community and our neighbors.”
Administrators ultimately intend to furnish the finished plaza with landscaped areas, tables, chairs, and modern wooden and stone benches.
Despite the ongoing construction, which created a hassle for some undergraduates hurrying to class last fall, students have already begun to enjoy the Science Center Plaza space.
This month, the Harvard Skate initiative brought a custom-made, 40-by-60-foot ice skating rink back to the Plaza for a second season.
Jenny Fung ’16, who works with Harvard Skate, said the rink drew an unexpectedly large crowd of community members, including faculty members and their children, who came to enjoy hot chocolate and a bonfire during Wintersession.
The rink, which provides on-site skate rentals and offers free access to all members of the community, is sponsored by Harvard’s Common Spaces program, Campus Services, and Harvard Student Agencies.
Lisa Hogarty—Vice President for Campus Services, which manages the plaza and other campus common spaces—heralded the Harvard Skate program as an example of things to come.
“Harvard Skate provides a great opportunity for the University community and our neighbors to come together,” Hogarty wrote in an emailed statement. “When the renovation of the Plaza is complete this spring, there will be many more events and activities, transforming the space.”

When Joseph D. Brain delivered the first lecture of his new physiology course “The Human Organism” in 1971, scientists had not yet eradicated smallpox, profiled DNA, or discovered HIV.
The men and women who filled the seats of Brain’s classroom that first day had only just begun living in the same residential Houses months before. And when they signed up for his class, these undergraduates enrolled under the old General Education curriculum, which would not be superseded by the new Core Curriculum for another eight years.
On Monday, more than four decades later, Brain delivered his first lecture of another semester of the course now titled Science of Living Systems 17: “The Human Organism”—for the 40th and final time. Brain, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has decided this semester’s offering of the course will be his last as he plans to devote more time to research. He has only skipped one year of teaching the course since its inception.
Despite the changes that have swept the scientific community and Harvard’s campus since the course was first offered more than 40 years ago, the fundamental mission of the class has remained unchanged: to make “The Human Organism” relevant to topics in public health, undergraduate interests in the humanities and social sciences, and current events.
SCIENCE WITHOUT BORDERS
In 1971, two years after joining the faculty at the School of Public Health, Brain decided that he wanted to teach undergraduates to think more critically about public health. At the time, he felt that College students lacked knowledge about the discipline, which he believed had important connections to subjects beyond medicine or even science.
“The context is that health really is a big deal. Whether you feel well or if you get certain diseases, it’s a huge part of our life, and it’s a huge part of the economy,” Brain said in an interview last week. “I really want people to understand the determinants of health: of their own individual health, of the people of the United States, global health.”
From the beginning, Brain sought to use the lecture component of the course to emphasize connections between his subject material and public health trends. But about ten years into teaching the class, he altered its structure to better reflect that goal.
He introduced topic sections devoted to exploring a specific subject, such as tuberculosis or obesity, into the section component of the course. Students in topic sections choose a focus within that subject and work toward writing a term paper.
Undergraduates who have taken the course say that the topic sections have given them a new perspective on public health. Rebecca A. Betensky ’87, a former student in the course, translated her topic section into a career path. Though she originally took Brain’s course to fulfill a Core requirement, her section on epidemiology helped her fine tune her interest in math into a passion for biostatistics.
“That was really enlightening to me,” Betensky said. “It was really exciting for me to see some applications of math in medical and scientific research, so that really sparked my interest in biostatistics.”
Betensky went on to get her Ph.D. in the subject. She is now a professor of biostatistics at the School of Public Health.
JACKS OF ALL TRADES
Brain has also sought to make his course relevant to non-science undergraduates. He says it is not designed for science students and estimates that only about 15 to 20 percent of students enrolled in the past have studied math or science.
Nancy C. Long Sieber, a longtime instructor for the course who once taught a topic section on battlefield medicine, said “The Human Organism” offers students the chance to explore diverse interests.
“It’s always impressive to me how health and biology and medicine touch these parts of people’s lives,” Long Sieber said. “Kids coming from very diverse backgrounds will find something interesting about the class, [whether a] government major, history—even if you’re studying French literature. There’s always something there that’s going to...have something to do with public health.”
Long Sieber is an adjunct physiology lecturer at the School of Public Health and currently co-teaches the course with Brain and Stephanie A. Shore, a senior lecturer on physiology at the School of Public Health.
Students who have taken the course over the years say that they have been able to examine topics in the humanities and the social sciences from a new perspective. Ana I. Mendy ’09 took “The Human Organism” as a sophomore to fulfill a Core requirement, but she ended up finding the topic section and the research she conducted for her term paper useful for a much larger project—her senior thesis.
Mendy, a history concentrator, had already been contemplating writing a thesis on the Haitian Revolution when she studied battlefield medicine for her topic section in Brain’s course. While writing her term paper on Haiti, she read literature that ultimately served as groundwork for her thesis research.
“That’s why I really liked [the class],” said Mendy, who is a former Crimson editorial writer. “It’s not only that the class was friendly for people who were not in science, but it was also a class that allowed you to do applied science to whatever you’re excited about, which in my case was history.”
CONNECTIONS IN REAL TIME
While striving to connect the course to themes in public health and students’ other academic interests, Brain has also sought to make his course timely.
According to current head teaching fellow Jennifer L. Garza, Brain continually revises the course to relate it to current events. In 2009, when a swine flu outbreak led to fears of an international pandemic, Brain adjusted his curriculum to devote time to covering the disease.
“He’s really good about adjusting from year to year what he teaches in order to be really relevant and capture the interest of the students,” said Garza, who is entering her fourth year teaching the course as a teaching fellow. “I think he is a fundamental part of setting the tone of the class.”
Long Sieber also lauded her colleague’s skill in making his subject material relevant across time and discipline.
“I’ll miss his enthusiasm, his wide range of knowledge, his ability to just move from one topic to another and see connections,” Long Sieber said. “[Brain] can find relevance in things that I just think are two different subjects. It’s a really hard thing to replace.”
Long Sieber, who works in an office right door next to Brain, said she hopes to continue teaching the course in the future, even as soon as 2015.
“[I want] to continue to make it the very relevant and timely course that he’s managed to maintain for all these years,” Long Sieber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino announced a partnership between Harvard and MIT that will bring edX—the rapidly growing online education venture started by both universities last spring—to the Boston community during his State of the City address Tuesday night.
“I am pleased to announce a pilot with Harvard, MIT, and edX that will bring free courses to community centers,” Menino said in the speech, which was delivered before a large audience including Massachussetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, Congressman Michael E. Capuano, and Victoria R. Kennedy, wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
The proposed agreement will give edX a location-based platform for the first time, providing Boston residents access to knowledge and skills as well as time with faculty and job trainers.
“Imagine a day when our community centers are little campuses in their own neighborhoods, full of vibrant groups of neighbors, exchanging ideas and making progress together,” Menino said, rousing applause from the crowd. “This initiative is a first, important step in that direction. We must connect adults in our neighborhoods with the opportunities of the knowledge economy.”
The new partnership is part of a larger education policy launched by the Mayor that will provide $30 million in new funding to underperforming schools in order to upgrade facilities, add teaching time, and enhance teaching and leadership.
The edX partnership will require contributions from both the city and the universities involved with edX to expand the program, which is currently structured around online courses for individuals. The ultimate goal is to facilitate a community-based group learning experience, according to a memo released by Menino. While the city will provide locations for community learning, research, and internship and job opportunities, edX, along with Harvard and MIT, will hold “Neighborhood Hours,” in-person meetings with university students and faculty. Harvard, MIT, and edX will also provide training on how to use the edX system, career counseling, and job transitioning programs.
“I’m very excited. [The partnership] brings technology into the neighborhoods of Boston. That’s so, so important. I think there are a lot of folks out there who could use that program,” Menino said after the event. “I look forward to edX, MIT, Harvard, Suffolk University, and some other universities stepping up to the plate to work with us.”
In his address, Menino also said that he intends to appoint a women’s workforce council, improve access to quality child care, and launch “Women on Main,” a networking opportunity for women who own businesses in the main streets of Boston.
Menino, who is 70 and recently spent two months in the hospital due to complications from a blood clot, entered the hall walking with a cane to Kelly Clarkson’s “What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger” and a five-minute standing ovation. “I was humbled by [the ovation],” he said after the speech. “And I know the question was, ‘Can he walk down the aisle?’ Give me a break. I could walk down that aisle 10 times.”
The speech also ended with the Clarkson hit.
Asked after the speech if an appropriate headline for the evening might be ‘Boston Strong, Menino Strong,’ the Mayor replied enthusiastically. “Yeah, no question. Stronger.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High preseason expectations and abysmal recent performances have combined to create a perfect storm of disappointment for the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-13-1, 3-11 ECAC). The Crimson, which both major preseason polls picked to finish third in the ECAC, has lost six straight and 10 of its last 11.
This weekend, Harvard returned to the Bright Hockey Center after a difficult seven-game road stand only to fall to Clarkson, 5-1, and St. Lawrence, 4-3 (OT). Now that the last-place Crimson sits more than a game behind its closest ECAC rival, fans may be more than ready to play The Blame Game.
Who is the easiest target of The Blame Game? The most obvious answer is Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. Fans may lump this month with a long string of recent underachieving Januaries for Donato’s squads. Over the past three seasons, Harvard has posted only five wins in 29 January games. Midseason hockey disappointment has become something of a Harvard tradition.
But this is no ordinary midseason slump. X’s and O’s or a different man behind the bench cannot adequately explain the Crimson’s woes. Rather, Blame Gamers may directly trace Harvard’s difficulties to a depleted defensive corps. A gaping hole in the Harvard blue line has sunk the Crimson’s ship this season.
On Dec. 10, the then-No. 18 Harvard men’s hockey team hosted an unranked UMass-Lowell squad. The results weren’t pretty. The Riverhawks steamrolled the Crimson, 5-0, handing Harvard its worst home loss since 2008.
Before the puck was dropped in that game, sophomore defensemen Max Everson and Patrick McNally, who had played in all seven of the team’s previous games, were taken off of the roster. The loss of these two key defenders promised to hurt. Last year, the ECAC had named McNally, a Vancouver Canucks draft pick, to its all-rookie first team. Everson, a Toronto Maple Leafs prospect, had appeared in all 34 of the Crimson’s games as a freshman.
During the 5-0 loss, it was clear that the shorthanded Harvard squad would have to make some significant adjustments. At the drop of a hat, Harvard lost one-third of its primary defensive corps. As the Crimson prepares for the first round of the Beanpot, Harvard fans should not underestimate the extent to which the midseason developments have impacted their team’s physical state and talent level.
The departures placed an immediate burden on the Crimson’s six remaining defenders. Everybody was on the front lines. In recent weeks, injuries have often forced the Crimson to rotate fewer than six defensemen. Saturday against St. Lawrence, Harvard played only four.
The situation has also required several Crimson players to assume significantly larger roles midway through the season. Everson and McNally were immediately replaced by juniors Danny Fick and John Caldwell, two ECAC all-academic selections who had only appeared in a combined 25 games for the Crimson last season. When freshman defender Desmond Bergin sustained an injury earlier this month, the Crimson called up junior JP Gillmeister from the Harvard club hockey team to suit up for two games.
The results during the absence of Everson and McNally speak for themselves.
Since their names were deleted from the roster, the Crimson has not won a single game in regulation. The team’s last regulation win came on Nov. 16 over Cornell.
At the beginning of the season, Harvard’s goals-against average with the defensive duo in the lineup was 2.14. Without them, it’s 4.25.
And with McNally off the power play unit, the Crimson’s success rate has dropped precipitously. Last year, Harvard converted 27.4 percent of its opportunities to lead the NCAA. This year, Harvard is dead-last in the ECAC at 10.5 percent.
Co-captain and defenseman Danny Biega has been unable to approach the Orr-esque numbers of seasons past. The defenseman has recorded only five points (all assists) this season, well off the pace for a third 30-point season.
Another Crimson hockey “tradition” in recent years has been the late-season resurgence. In the last two seasons, Harvard rebounded from disappointing midseason performances to finish strongly. In 2011, a sub-.400 Crimson squad went 7-1 after the Beanpot before falling to Dartmouth in the ECAC quarterfinals. In 2012, the team that set a record for the most ties in an NCAA season found a way to win late, making a surprising run to the conference final.
In 2013, Harvard will receive another late-season opportunity to reassert itself. The Crimson’s 6-5 comeback, overtime win over No. 8 Boston University on Jan. 9 speaks to Harvard’s talent and heart. But as the Crimson continues to struggle with its impossible defensive dilemma, Harvard fans may have little hope that the tradition will continue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it hired Imry Halevi in November, Harvard Athletics made a commitment to improved multimedia productions and sent a message to its fans that it was seeking to push the Harvard sports brand nationwide. Halevi, the current Director of Multimedia and Production, aims to use local, regional, and national broadcasters to distribute improved in-house content across the nation.
“I think that Harvard Athletics has great potential [for expansion] with such a great history and tradition in college sports,” Halevi said. “The question is not whether you have a large budget or the best equipment. Rather, it’s whether you put in the time and effort to pull together a first-class production. I think that at Harvard, we have the infrastructure to do that.”
Harvard is the first Ivy League school to create the position now held by Halevi, who was previous the Associate Director of Video Production at Northeastern University. The Maccabim, Israel, native produced the first ever collegiate women’s ice hockey game on the ESPN family of networks in addition to producing some 100 broadcasts last season.
“We feel like Imry is one of the most talented people who has worked in athletics and the video production side of the business,” said Northeastern athletic director Peter Roby. “He was a tremendous asset to us and put us in a leadership position for college athletics at our level with the sophistication, organization, and quality of production he helped us attain. He helped produce quality content everywhere and we are sorry to see him go, but feel fortunate that we had him for the time that he did.”
Halevi said that an expansion in Crimson coverage on national networks could have a major effect on recruiting for the school. Harvard’s lack of athletic scholarships creates one obstacle to its recruiting efforts, and that disadvantage is only amplified by the dearth of national media coverage it receives in comparison to larger schools from major sports conferences.
“I think that, depending on the specific sport and the specific coaches, online video productions can greatly contribute to recruitment,” Halevi said. “Prospective student athletes have a chance to watch Harvard’s teams play before they come…and parents of [these athletes] know that they’ll be able to watch their daughter or son play on campus even if they cannot make it to Boston for every game.”
Currently, Harvard sports are not readily accessible through alternative media forms like tablets and smartphones. Halevi says that he will stress expanding coverage to allow more access for fans on the go in an effort to expand the Crimson’s fan base and build loyalty.
“If people like to watch sports on their iPhones and iPads, we need to make sure that our content is easily available there. If people like on-demand videos on their TVs, we should look into getting into that field,” Halevi said. “The easier we make it for people to find our content, the more likely we’ll be to get new fans for Harvard Athletics and get people to come to games on campus.”
At Northeastern, in addition to overseeing all hiring and training for the video production team, Halevi was the executive producer for all of Northeastern’s broadcasts on ESPN and its family of networks. This included ESPN3—likely the only medium through which many Crimson fans have streamed a game online.
One immediate goal of the new department is to improve Harvard’s streaming technology—Halevi aims to put it “on the same level as the best college streams [in] the country.”
In his first few months, his efforts have largely focused on updating the department’s streaming equipment in an effort to achieve that goal. But as Halevi looks long-term, he hopes to create a media department on par with the nation’s best.
“There are several schools in New England and around the country that do a good job at producing and broadcasting their games online who rely on a variety of different setups from high-end equipment and freelance professional staff to mid-range equipment and all-student staff,” Halevi said. “I think what will be interesting to see is where we end up on that spectrum. There is no doubt that Harvard Athletics has the potential to have one of the best productions in the country. Now all that’s left is to figure out is how we’ll get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a loss to Dartmouth last Saturday handed the Harvard women’s basketball team an early Ivy League loss and halted its six-game win streak against its Hanover opponents, the Crimson will try to get back on track this weekend when it faces Yale and Brown on the road.
“You wipe the slate clean because I have always said, and I say again this year, anyone can be anyone in the Ivy League because it’s a very special conference,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We don’t have a postseason. Every game is huge and I think there’s just enormous pride.”
Harvard (10-6, 1-1 Ivy) will arrive in New Haven fresh off the loss to the Big Green, 58-45, that saw the Crimson give up 28 turnovers to its opponents.
“Turnovers were the name of the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “That was it, coupled with poor shooting, but we could have handled the poor shooting. We couldn’t handle 28 turnovers.”
Controlling the ball will be necessary as the Harvard defense looks to contain a trio of high-scoring Bulldog (6-10, 1-1) guards.
“We know that Yale is a quick team,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “They like to shoot quick and play an up-tempo game. They’re in your face the whole game.”
Junior Janna Graf put up team-high points against the Crimson last year in both Yale’s win, 68-63, and loss, 71-51. This season, she has averaged 11.9 points per game, trailing scoring leader sophomore Sarah Halejian, who nets an average of 13.9 points per game. Senior Megan Vasquez posted her career-high four rebounds against Harvard last Jan. 27 and rounds out the group with 8.8 points per game.
“They try to use their quickness in the outside game against us,” Golen said. “I think we just need to focus on containing the drive as well as getting after the three point shots since they do have some pretty good shooters as well.”
Similarly, a sharp-shooting backcourt runs the floor for the Bears (6-9, 1-1). Junior guard Lauren Clarke pulls in an average of 13.9 points while handing out three assists per game. Co-Captain Sheila Dixon notches 11.9 points and leads the effort on the glass, grabbing an average of five boards per game.
“Even though neither one of [the two teams] have a tremendous non-conference record, they’re both extremely dangerous,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’ve played some good teams to close games and didn’t end up with the win. They’re similar – they’re athletic, they’re scrappy, they’re physical.”
The Bulldogs and Brown have split match-ups with each other this season, with the Bears taking the first contest, 68-67, thanks to a buzzer-beater, but dropping the second, 59-47.
In the second meeting of the two teams, Halejian posted her first career double-double with 21 points and 10 rebounds.
The Crimson will attempt to match its opponents’ athleticism with continued defensive pressure and finding an offensive rhythm.
“[Against Dartmouth] I think we made a lot of errors by rush[ing] and hurry[ing] and the pressure kind of took us off guard and we played a little tight and timid,” Golen said. “Getting ready for this weekend we just have to be ready to face teams that are going to be in our face because we definitely have a ton on our back.”
Christine Clark chipped in 22 points against the Big Green and was the only player from Harvard to record double-digit points in the contest. The junior guard has cracked double-digits in all but one game this season, breaking the 20-point mark in five match-ups.
After putting up eight points and nabbing 10 rebounds, sophomore Temi Fagbenle received her sixth Ivy League Rookie of the Week award on Monday. The forward is the third leading scorer for the team with 11.3 points per game and was just short of a fourth career double-double this weekend.
The Crimson was unable to connect from behind the arc last Saturday, drilling just one three out of 19 total attempts.
While a rally at the end of the second half by Clark and Fagbenle pulled Harvard within six, Dartmouth, which shot just 30.8 percent for the contest, nailed 10 of 11 attempts from the charity stripe to seal the win.
“Again, we’re just hoping to play more solid defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “I get that our emphasis has been on the defensive end and I was quite disappointed and shocked that offense was our trouble at Dartmouth. We found some solutions and hopefully we can keep stressing our defense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off the excitement of a last-minute comeback win against Ivy League opponent Dartmouth last Saturday, the Harvard men’s basketball team faces two league rivals at home this weekend, hosting Yale on Friday and Brown the following evening. The Crimson (10-6, 2-0 Ivy) currently holds an early half game lead in the Ivy League race over Princeton, the only other undefeated team.
Last Saturday, Harvard struggled for much of the game against a Big Green team that owns the worst overall record in the conference. Yet, after being down 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Crimson tied up the game thanks to a string of threes by co-captain Christian Webster, several Dartmouth missed free throws, and a clutch lay-up from freshman Siyani Chambers. Harvard scored 20 points in overtime and held on to win by five.
“The most amazing comeback ever,” Webster said after the game. “I’m at a loss for words.”
The Crimson struggled from the field against the Big Green, especially from deep. While it finished the game with five makes from beyond the arc, three of them came in the final three minute of regulation. For the season, Harvard is 22nd in its division in field goal percentage, shooting around 48 percent. The team also shoots above 40 percent from beyond the arc.
Despite his squad’s slow start, Webster was named Ivy League Co-player of the week for the first time this season. Chambers continued to rack up awards, earning his fifth Ivy Rookie of the week, approaching the record of eight.
The Bulldogs (7-12, 1-1) also come into the contest following an overtime win. After losing the conference opener versus the Bears the previous week, Yale built an 11-point lead in its rematch game only to quickly lose momentum and face an extra period. It managed to outscore Brown by 11 in overtime, though, and won, 75-64.
Touted freshman big man Justin Sears has spearheaded the Bulldogs down low thus far this season. He averages 10.6 points and leads the team with 6.4 rebounds per game. At 6’8”, he will pose a tough match-up for a relatively small Crimson team, which ranks 311th in the NCAA in boards per game.
Conversely, the Bears (7-9, 1-1) are hoping to rebound from last weekend’s loss. Brown is a frontcourt-oriented team, led by senior Matt Sullivan, a tall guard who is also strong on the boards. On the season Sullivan averages 14.8 points per game to go along with 5.1 rebounds.  Junior Sean McGonagill averages 14.6 and the guard pair accounts for 49 percent of their squad’s points.
The team also boasts two big men taller than 6’8” who post more than seven rebounds per contest. Sophomore Rafael Maia, in his first season of activity, has averaged a team high 7.9 boards, including a season high of 15.
To go along with the strong play of Webster and Chambers, the latter of whom leads the Ivy League with 6.1 assists per game, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker emphasized the importance of the sophomore class’s production.
“Our sophomore class is a key group for us,” said Amaker after the Dartmouth game. “Jonah [Travis], Steve [Mondou-Missi], Kenyatta [Smith], and Wesley [Saunders]. I think that’s the group that’s going to have the chance to have an impact on us as a team.”
Saunders has put up some of the strongest statistics so far this season for the Crimson, averaging 16.3 points per game and leading the team in rebounding. He tallied 20 points against Dartmouth, including 13 in the second half. Classmate Smith also helped out against the Big Green, grabbing six boards in just 11 minutes of play and preventing Dartmouth from several second chances opportunities.
“They were playing their butts off in every facet of the game,” said Webster. “The big guys were driving and getting off shots.”

It's time to pay homage to one of the great American traditions: the Super Bowl. Although the game is traditionally celebrated by consuming copious amounts of PBR and wings and participation in a betting pool, student athletes recently received a friendly email from Ryan Pekarek, a Compliance Intern from Harvard University's Department of Athletics, with the subject line "Don't Bet On It." The email reminded them that the NCAA prohibits "engaging in gambling activities as they relate to intercollegiate ore professional sporting events."
So while the rest of America will put up $10 billion dollars over this Sunday's game, student athletes can't engage in sports wagering, defined as "putting something at risk, such as an entry fee, with the opportunity to win something in return."
And just in case these NCAA, nationally ranked, physically agile, quick-thinking student-athletes didn’t get the message, the email also included the following formula:
Entry Fee/Something wagered + Prize Opportunity = NOT Permissible
Fair enough NCAA—this formula does seem rather foolproof. So what's a jock to do? No worries. While the rest of Harvard is throwing down big ones, here are some other items you could wager:
Your mess. 
It's a Super Bowl party—there’s going to be wings, dip, beer, plenty of shouting at the TV, and almost inevitable wreckage to your poor dorm room. Sure, the supporters of the losing team may be bummed, but you wage, you rage, you pay. As soon as the boo-hoos are over, it’s time to whip out the Clorox wipes to clean up their sorry mess.
 
Your head. 
Don't worry, Flyby isn't talking literal heads—we don't encourage that sort of thing—but athletes could wager their luscious locks in support of their team. Losers should surrender their hair to the cuts and shaved patterns imagined by their friends. So even though your home team didn't win, you'll become a real headturner in the dhalls.
 
Your body.
While prostitution makes for a first-rate class this semester, it doesn't belong at your Super Bowl party. Instead, hand the winners a Magic Marker, or a Sharpie if you really want to raise the stakes, and let them get creative with their body art. Let's just hope your friends can come up with something less drastic than this, but more clever than genitalia.
Your soul.
Just kidding, it didn't work for Faust, and it won't work for you. Even Drew can't help you with this one.

Guess what? A brand new exclusive social organization is arriving on campus this semester! With the impending arrival of women's fraternity Alpha Phi, we at Flyby thought we'd let you know what exactly makes this national organization distinctive.
1. Next time you look up into the night sky and spot Ursa Major, spare a thought for Alpha Phi, as it's their official constellation. So excited are they about this that the "Phi bear" is their mascot.
2. Notable alumni include the former president of Lifetime Television, Mrs. America 2007 (yes, Mrs.), and Ashley Tisdale's sister. Rush Alpha Phi and you too can join the ranks of these illustrious public figures!
3. Following the correct Greek pronunciation, "Phi" is actually pronounced, "Fee." It's been claimed that the women's fraternity adopted this rather than the anglicized "fie" because it sounded "more feminine." Nothing screams sisterhood like making your title sound more fee-male.
4. Because we're sure you're all dying to know, Alpha Phi's official leaf is ivy. Well, we're definitely familiar with that. Welcome to Harvard, you'll feel right at home.
5. Want to snap pictures like a real Alpha Phi? While some sororities put fingers in their mouths, and others throw crooked arms in the air, Alpha Phi has their own style. Get practicing; your Facebook friends can't wait to see it!
