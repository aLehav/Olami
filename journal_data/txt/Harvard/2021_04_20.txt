Sufjan Stevens’ most recent album takes listeners on an introspective, emotional journey. Stevens released “Meditations” on April 8 in the wake of his father’s death as the first part of a five-album volume titled “Convocations,” which will chronicle loss and mourning. “Meditations” is a short album — only around 27 minutes long — that provides a musical representation of grief. Stevens’ lo-fi, electronic instrumentals revolve around pedal tones, complemented by layers of a few repeating chords.
The first songs — “Meditation I,” “Meditation II,” and “Meditation III” — are calm and repetitive, almost claustrophobic, trapping the listener in a mild-mannered loop of flat electronic strings. There is little to no chord progression, adding to the stagnant, almost suspended, atmosphere.
Moving on to Meditations IV to VII, the mood changes as Stevens introduces more dissonance by layering more frequent chord changes, piano, and percussive static. These more textured, dynamic, and jarring songs create a sense of disruption and unease.
The final three meditations introduce a more upbeat tempo. Strings feature prominently again, this time with electronic vocals and light percussive textures. The different instruments crescendo and then taper off into simple electronic chords. Stevens paints a vivid picture of the static aspects of loss, with sounds that seem to capture an inability to accept and move on. It is so easy to follow the loop back to “Meditation I,” returning right back to where Stevens begins.
Although the album narrates a compelling emotional journey for Stevens, the sound itself can often feel choppy, with truncated, unsatisfying endings to each song. The absence of dynamics, though interesting thematically, has the unfortunate effect of making the album’s songs feel two-dimensional. Overall, the musical structure of “Meditations” is not especially unique, sounding similar to other lo-fi background tracks. Songs are only differentiated by sudden, jolting shifts from strings to piano, which add to the album’s disjointed atmosphere. The lack of transitions between the relatively short sections also adds to a less cohesive flow, interrupting the album’s end goal: the listener’s emotional journey.
Stevens describes the “Convocations” album suite as a “reflection on a year of anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, and loss.” The lack of lyrics makes room for contemplation: This album tries to give listeners space to think and interpret. Stevens’s laudable goals may resonate with anyone who has lost a loved one. Whether listeners will enjoy or come back to the album, though, is another question.

The first iteration of Emma Seligman’s “Shiva Baby” was a short fiction film she produced for her thesis at NYU in 2018. In that short, college student Danielle runs into her on-the-side sugar daddy at a family shiva where the two confront the secrets they’ve been keeping from each other. Since then, Seligman has elevated her work from an interesting idea to a fully-fledged masterpiece. The plot of 2020’s feature-length “Shiva Baby” remains largely the same, but with much more room to explore the complex power dynamics at play in this large Jewish family and build waves of slowly rising tension.
Seligman imbues almost every second of the film with overwhelming anxiety. Each line of dialogue spins a new thread of a complex web for viewers to revel in, or attempt to untangle if they dare. Danielle’s sugar baby status is further complicated by the presence of Maya, one of her past romantic partners, a relationship all of her older relatives dismiss under the guise of the girls just “experimenting.” Seligman is herself bisexual, and the whole story has an ethereally queer quality. The scenario of a sugar daddy at a funeral has a very bleak but hysterically funny awkwardness to it, evoking the 2016 dark comedy “Suicide Kale” (also by a queer director, Carly Usdin) about a dinner party that goes awry when a guest finds an unsigned suicide note. It’s often difficult for films to walk the line between funny and horrifying, but “Shiva Baby” does backflips on it without faltering for a minute.
Seligman also uses her own background as a young Jewish woman to inform the story and characters. Her characters play their formal roles as mourners, while chafing against the unspoken rules of these types of family gatherings. The Jewishness of the family is an integral part of the story, and is woven artfully throughout the film.
Seligman’s sense for suspenseful direction is impeccable, and her sophomore feature could just as easily be a horror movie as a follow-up comedy; she could bring new depth to either genre. This perfect balance between horror and comedy is only intensified by the score. Composer Ariel Marx artfully includes the chaotic noises of the shiva, making for particularly grounding and grating moments in the music. The use of intense “Jaws”-like string instruments puts viewers on edge, and clever sound mixing of a crying baby helps emphasize the film’s most harrowing moments.
These types of sound interpolations help to bridge the gap between viewers and Danielle. The audience reacts to the shrill score at the same moment Danielle is dealing with the baby’s shrill crying after an increasingly tense day. Rachel Sennott reprises her role as the central character from the short film, acing the role of an imperfect, aimless almost-college graduate. Repeatedly, she butts heads with her old friend/flame Maya, played by Molly Gordon of “Booksmart” fame. Gordon’s performance is exceptionally impressive here as she brings an incredible depth and life to the character, and her chemistry with Sennott is exquisite.
Overall, “Shiva Baby” shows a bright future for new, queer stories in filmmaking. It’s an expertly directed portrait of an extended family and all the complexities, questions, and deceptions that come with it. It’s one of those rare films where every person on set — from the director, to the composer, to the cinematographer, to the costumer, to the actors — perfectly understood the assignment. The pieces of the film fit together like a well-oiled machine to masterfully portray a messy, nuanced family.

“Britney Spears hospitalized again”, “Britney on 72-Hour Mental Lockdown”, “Diagnosing Britney Spears,” “Sources: Spears suffering from bipolar disorder.” These news headlines from early 2008 covered the public struggle which, on Feb. 1 of that year, led a California court to hand over control of Britney Spears’ life and finances to her father, Jamie.
Conservatorships are a legal concept governed by state law whereby a court appoints a person or organization called a conservator to care for another person, a conservatee, who is deemed incapable of caring for themselves or their financial affairs. The state of California, in particular, differentiates between the so-called Lanterman-Petris-Short conservatorships (used for individuals with serious mental illness who need special care) and probate conservatorship, which can be either temporary or permanent and covers the person’s life, estate, or both.
When a judge made Britney Spears’ controversial probate conservatorship permanent after eight months, People magazine ran quotes from sources that stated, “This is by no means something that’s going to last forever” and that “People shouldn’t read too much into the word ‘permanent’.” Now in 2021, with the #FreeBritney movement growing, The New York Times’ “Framing Britney Spears” documentary coming out, and the next hearing in the ongoing legal battle scheduled for Apr. 27, one thing seems clear. What was expected to be a temporary arrangement turned into a 13-year-long conservatorship that has left Britney Spears with no legal control over her finances and limited control over her personal life.
What that means in practice is that Britney Spears needs her father’s approval for the most mundane things, be it a purchase of a hypothetical caramel frappuccino or a slightly less hypothetical iPhone, which the singer with a $60 million dollar net worth was actually denied until 2019. That on its own wouldn’t be a problem, however. If Britney’s conservatorship were a typical case, it would be clear why she shouldn’t be allowed to spend her money. Permanent conservatorships are restricted to incapacitated individuals, unable to manage their lives, usually the elderly or people suffering from untreatable mental illness or extensive dissability. Spears’ case is anything but typical, though. “From the little I saw and have seen of Britney Spears, there's no way she would, in my mind, qualify for conservatorship under normal circumstances,” said Don Slater, a California attorney specializing in conservatorships, in an interview with Vice.
Indeed, it’s hard to understand how Spears’ conservatorship has lasted so long, as she clearly is and has been well enough to continue working. In the past 13 years, Britney Spears has done everything from being a judge on “The X Factor” and releasing three new albums to raising a million dollars for the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation and engaging in social activism landed her an award from GLAAD in 2018.
Unfortunately, it’s easier to understand why the arrangement is still in place despite doubts over its ethics. While there are legal avenues for the conservatee to end or change the conservatorship by filing a motion in court, these avenues are useless in practice while the arrangement continues. Conservatorship takes away an individual’s right to enter contracts. This might sound innocent enough, but it means that the conservatee cannot hire an attorney without a court’s express permission. In Britney’s case, that meant an uphill legal battle against her father, who controlled her money, just to be able to get a lawyer to represent her. And that has only been the beginning of a long fight. Samuel Ingham, Spears’ court-appointed attorney, sued seeking to replace Jamie Spears as the conservator on Aug. 17, 2020, and there’s still no resolution on the horizon.
“Wouldn’t it be something if the giants of mental health care reform in California turned out to be three men named Lanterman, Petris and Short — and a pop singer by the name of Britney Spears?” asked Patt Morrison in his LA Times article, wondering if the singer’s case could be the push needed to change California’s flawed conservatorship laws. Nothing has come to pass yet. But perhaps now, 13 years after Morrison's piece was originally published, and with more public attention than ever, Britney Spears’ lawsuit could change more than just her conservator: It might impact a California law that can turn custody into captivity with almost no way of regaining control.

After being delayed for more than a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, the ninth installment of the “Fast & Furious” franchise is finally within sight, with a release date of June 25. The latest trailer for the film is a perfect taste of everything a “Fast & Furious” movie should be. It starts with a short narrative arc to refamiliarize the audience with the franchise’s universe — a helpful reminder since it’s been more than four years since the previous installment was released in 2017. Against a background of gorgeous cars and easy music, the gang assembles, including the charming leader Dom (Vin Diesel), his kick-ass wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and familiar comic relief characters Roman and Tej (Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris).
The series also appears ready to finally address the sudden passing of Paul Walker midway through filming of the seventh installment. His absence has been explained in-world as him and his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) taking time away from heists to focus on expanding their own family. Mia’s return and the tone of the trailer seem to imply that his death will now be echoed in-world, catalyzing everyone’s homecoming. The fast familia is back again.
Around 45 seconds into the trailer, all hell breaks loose. There’s a new villain in the franchise: Dom’s brother, played – both delightfully and inexplicably — by John Cena. The remaining 2 and a half minutes of the trailer deliver exactly what longtime fans have come to expect from a “Fast & Furious” film — fast cars and explosions stapled together with something that vaguely resembles a plot — but passes by too fast to question, with a healthy pause for comedy. The franchise has succeeded for so long because each new addition manages to rise to the level of the one before it, then raise the stakes of the central quest and deliver on a high-powered ending action sequence.
In the words of Roman, a character known for his comic relief, “We’ve taken out planes, trains, tanks. I’m not even going to think about the submarine. And now we’ve got cars flying in the air?” The answer to his last question is a resounding YES! This movie is not going to be one for the physicists, as it seems like most of the big action sequences will be hinging on cinema magic under the guise of magnets powerful enough to move armored vehicles with the press of a button.
Like every movie in the franchise, there’s somehow too much and also not enough going on to really track anything from moment to moment, but there are some key things from the trailer to keep in mind while racing towards theaters this June. Critically, the character Han (first established in “Tokyo Drift” and thought to have been killed at the end of “Fast & Furious 6”) has returned. This marks the second time the series has revived a character from the grave after Letty’s supposed death from the fourth to sixth films, and could open the door for more returns (maybe Gal Gadot’s Gisele, killed at the end of “Fast Five?”).
While John Cena will be the main antagonist this time around, it seems like he’ll be backed up by familiar villain Cipher (Charlize Theron). She suffered a great defeat at the end of the 8th film, and from her bangs we can tell that she’s been through some shit in the time elapsed in-world. Also returning will be Helen Mirren, who is — and I cannot stress this enough — uncredited for her role in the 8th film, “The Fate of the Furious.” This actually throws a potential wrench into the timeline of the Fast universe. As it stands, the order of release of the latest films will be “The Fate of the Furious” (2017), “Hobbs & Shaw” (2019), and “F9” (2021). However, “F9” was originally slated for release all the way back in April 2019, and was delayed to allow Hobbs & Shaw to be the Fast movie of the summer instead. “F9” may end up actually taking place before the events of “Hobbs & Shaw.”
It’s also important to view this not just as the ninth film in a series, but as the first in a trilogy. The Fast franchise is slated for two more films, ending on the 11th, and director Justin Lin is already confirmed to direct them. As he said in his director commentary of the fifth installment, he considers his directorial work on “Fast & Furious” (2009), “Fast Five” (2011), and “Fast & Furious 6” (2013) to make up a trilogy within the larger series. It seems likely that he’ll be approaching the ninth through eleventh films in a similar fashion. “F9” is gearing up to be the beginning of an epic end to one of Hollywood’s most beloved franchises.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the increased opportunities for self-reflection and individual creativity provided by the somber pause of the pandemic, podcasting has emerged as an exciting avenue for communicating original ideas and thoughts to a broader audience.
A group of Harvard freshmen who all share a common passion for podcasting decided to come together last semester and plant the beginnings of the Harvard College Podcast Network (HCPN), a student organization that now produces seven student-led shows. The founders include: David D. Chen ’24, Brandon L. Kingdollar ’24, Fez S. Zafar ’24, Anna G. Farronay ’24, Melissa Meng ’24, and Simar S. Bajaj ’24.
David D. Chen ’24, President of the HCPN, described how the organization came to be and what sparked the team’s motivations and drive. As students who know the joy of podcasting, members of the board expressed that through HCPN, they wanted to create a non-competitive environment for student podcasters at Harvard.
“There wasn’t a need for any additional motivation. The only other thing that spurred us to create this organization was knowing that almost every Harvard student was the ideal podcaster,” Chen said. “They are always brimming with ideas, passionate, and sure with their perspectives.”
The Harvard College Podcast Network provides student podcasters with a broader support system for production and promotion. The organization offers guidance and assistance to any interested student, no matter what their previous podcasting experience is. “The only barrier between the idea and the podcast itself is production, editing — that kind of expertise — and we are aiming to offer students this support, to make their dreams a reality,” said Brandon L. Kingdollar, the Co-Director of Content.
Emily H. Song ’24 is a student podcaster who is currently sponsored by the Harvard College Podcast Network. She hosts “Unfiltered,” a podcast that she initially started as a way to record her college experiences. On “Unfiltered,” Song holds open and oftentimes very personal conversations with frequent guest appearances, using the platform to highlight issues that she feels should be brought to the surface and discussed more candidly.
Song expressed that the most rewarding aspect of hosting “Unfiltered” is when younger individuals reach out to her, telling her about how they’ve been inspired and motivated by her podcast. “I’ve always loved the idea of mentoring others and providing help to younger people,” Song said.
On a more personal level, Song finds joy in documenting her life through her podcast, and through other means. “Apart from podcasting I love to journal, for example, and I think that podcasting is a great way to remember all that was going on in my head, in my life at the time,” Song said.
Members on the board of the Network also expressed how meaningful it has been to build this support system for student podcasters. “I think the most rewarding experience so far is getting a taste of how many amazing minds there are at Harvard. There are so many fascinating, creative visions,” Kingdollar said.
For example, Kingdollar mentioned a current show in the making that is based on a post-apocalyptic world, juxtaposed with discussions of pop culture. “It really means a lot to me to help pave the way for this content to be heard, and elevating these voices that are so brilliant and creative,” Kingdollar said.
As a fairly new and quickly growing organization, the Harvard College Podcast Network has exciting plans and aspirations for the future. Many new podcasts are in the making, with the guidance and resources of the Network. In addition to new content, the Network is also hoping to soon reach out to a broader audience, beyond Harvard.
Chen has big ambitions for HCPN and wants to expand and promote their mission of “democratizing knowledge and experience through podcasting.” He wants to create an HCPN original podcast called the Epiphany Podcast, in an effort to involve the Harvard community in an SNL-style guest hosting format.
The Harvard College Podcast Network is an exciting, rapidly growing organization striving to build a community of passionate students with creative inspiration and drive. HCPN seeks to make podcasting accessible to all individuals, and Kingdollar emphasized that anyone can be a podcaster. “We want to get people with entry-level experience so that they can take it and run with it,” he said. Through podcasting, students can express their unique ideas and share the knowledge they have obtained to a wider audience — and the HCPN is ready to help them make it happen.

“It’s nature; it's a savage world of things dying or eating each other right beneath our feet.” When the brooding aristocrat Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) speaks these words to Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) during a gloomy garden party early in “Crimson Peak,” she speaks to the core theme of Guillermo Del Toro’s 2015 bleakly atmospheric, engrossing modern-day fairytale. “Crimson Peak” is a lush exploration of what lies beneath: beneath the floorboards, yes, but also beneath the veneers of society, history, ambition, personality, and love. “Crimson Peak” comes to Netflix this week, and horror fans and Del Toro devotees alike should check it out for a mesmerizing viewing experience bolstered by stunning visuals and immersive worldbuilding.
Del Toro’s signature style and gravitas are on full display in “Crimson Peak,” bringing haunting vitality to a simple story with otherwise tropified characters. The movie centers around Edith, a bright-eyed industrial heiress and writer in 19th-century Buffalo (reminiscent of Wasikowska’s role in the 2010 Victorian-Gothic “Alice in Wonderland” adaptation) whose life changes when she meets the mysterious baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). As a romance blossoms between them, she’s drawn into his business aspirations and shadowy past, which take a dark turn when she moves with Thomas and his sister Lucille to their family’s crumbling English estate. It’s a formulaic, familiar narrative that could pass as a folk tale or fable: A naive heiress meets a charming, conniving stranger, marries him, then discovers the skeletons in his (and his heirloom mansion’s) closets.
From the opening shot of Edith stumbling across a desolate snowscape, bloody and gaunt in a high-necked dressing gown, the film’s greatest assets carry all the way through to the credits. For one, Del Toro’s striking use of color and framing creates a rich, mystical world around the main narrative. The sepia-toned, yellowed palette of the first act, in which Edith is ensconced in her father’s house and Buffalo’s gossipy social scene, creates a sense of security and comfort; the warm glow of her childhood home is only briefly interrupted by the arrival of a terrifying supernatural presence which warns her about the future (and, in hallmark Del Toro style, takes a monstrous form quite unlike the classic Victorian ghost). When Edith moves to England, however, the color palette shifts to revolve around deep contrasts, drawing parallels to the aforementioned garden party scene where Edith and Lucille see a pile of yellow-gold butterflies decaying in the dirt. The royal blue, marigold, and mossy-green tones of the costumes and aging decor stand out against the backdrop of the rotting manor, hinting at the death and destruction that will soon consume Edith’s story. Through all this, there is the titular crimson: While red appears as a mottled burgundy in the vintage-toned first act, the bright, bloody color is ubiquitous in Edith’s new home, not least because of the red soil it sits upon, which stains the snow in winter.
The cardinal-red soil beneath the Sharpe’s estate ultimately ties the entire story together. It’s the literal catalyst for Edith and Thomas’ introduction, as Thomas is traveling the world marketing an industrial digging device he developed on the land, but it’s also an obvious allegory for the movie’s central conflict. As the house sinks deeper into the ground and scarlet sludge seeps up through the manor, Del Toro illustrates how the Sharpes, and now Edith, are mired in their family’s bloody past and gradually succumbing to the secrets buried there. All those things that have died, or eaten each other, are indeed beneath their feet — but they can’t be kept there. It certainly isn’t subtle, but it works: The luxe visual symbolism creates a pervasive feeling of dread, rather than devolving into campiness.
In walking that fine line, Del Toro gets help from costume designer Kate Hawley, whose gorgeous period outfits deepen the velvety aesthetics of the movie and develops Edith and Lucille as opposing forces of innocence and manipulation, respectively. Tom Sanders’ otherworldly production design creates a sweeping sense of majesty and drama, even as the narrative zeroes in on only a few key characters. The film’s cinematography embraces the sheer scope of Del Toro's vision, with an immersive use of wide shots to emphasize how Edith is dwarfed by the scale of her new home and figuratively lost in its labyrinthine halls.
The film also benefits from magnetic performances by Chastain and Wasikowska. Wasikowska’s fraught portrayal of Edith conveys the character’s naivete without making her seem out-of-touch or unsympathetic, and Chastain is achingly agonized as the story’s villain, bringing depth to what could have been a one-dimensional antagonist.
Ultimately, “Crimson Peak” is working within a distinct genre: a contemporary fairy tale told through a horror lens, with equal parts Gothic melodrama and gruesome violence. But the staggering setpieces and immersive fantasy world feel as much like characters as Edith, Thomas or Lucille do, and Del Toro’s worldbuilding works to intoxicating effect. Though it came out in 2015 and the horror offerings on streaming services abound, fans of period dramas, ghost-story flicks, and transporting fantasy tales should certainly take note of “Crimson Peak.”

Many writers struggle to discern the beginning of a story. For novelist Leslie D. Epstein’s latest project, this challenge takes on added significance. Though much of his work has dealt extensively with the tribulations of history, Epstein’s newest story takes that exploration to another level. In his novel “Hill of Beans: A Novel of War and Celluloid,” Epstein is not merely examining a national history — he is also examining his very own. “I think I’ve been working on this for ten years — and in some ways, all my life,” he says.
“Hill of Beans” weaves multiple voices — many of which are those of historical figures including Stalin, Hitler, and former Warner Bros. Vice President Jack L. Warner — to craft a nuanced portrayal of Hollywood’s movers and shakers on the eve of World War II. Epstein calls the novel a “combination of dual themes” that run through his literary body — World War II and the Holocaust, and Hollywood.
Epstein drew from childhood stories to situate his novel in an immersive historical context. One of the central threads in the novel’s plot is the adversarial relationship between Jack Warner and twins Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. The twins, most famous for co-writing the screenplay of the iconic film “Casablanca,” were Epstein’s uncle and father, respectively. “Some of the Epstein brothers and Jack Warner back-and forth — those are family stories that I heard for years,” Epstein says. “My father died young, but my uncle, his identical twin, stepped in as a sort of substitute father, a wonderful father to me.”
The historical landscape of Epstein’s “Hill of Beans” is similar to that of his father and uncle’s “Casablanca.” The parallels between the two works, however, extend beyond historical context, spilling into their formal artistic elements. Not unlike “Casablanca” itself, Epstein’s distinct narrative elements coalesce to deliver a cinematic reading experience. His literary techniques function like cinematography. “I don’t have a lot of interiority, as they call it. In this book, I don’t have an overarching omniscient narrator, I don’t have all the things that are familiar in fiction,” he says. “What I do have are things that are central to filmmaking. A montage would have been a good word to describe this novel.”
By reaching into a violent past, Epstein grapples with a timeless artistic predicament: how to write about, and thereby humanize, fundamentally bad people. Take, for example, Jack Warner. Epstein entered the drafting process primarily aware of Warner through his father and uncle’s stories. “I began this totally on my father and uncle’s side,” Epstein says. However, as he continued his research for the novel, he developed a complex ambivalence toward Warner, whose legacy is steeped in misogyny and racism.
Still, some grudgingly admirable glimpses of Warner’s character made it into the book as well. When told he had to fire every Jew in his German offices, Warner refused, instead opting to close his branches there. “I went in knowing he was a terrible, terrible person. But the more I researched him, and the more he grew in my imagination, the fonder of him I became,” he says. “So it’s a mixed portrait.”
Epstein is no stranger to literary controversy. Similar to “Hill of Beans,” Epstein’s novel “King of the Jews” uses comedy as a lens to interrogate the violence of the Holocaust. The project, though well-received by some, also garnered significant backlash. “I started and stopped it ten times because it kept coming out in a sort of jaunty, humorous way,” Epstein says. “At that point, there hadn’t been any comic vantage point of looking at the Holocaust — maybe there still shouldn’t be — but I couldn’t help it.”
A comedic subtext is Epstein’s way of staying true to his own voice, his distinct way of questioning the past. “If I’m going to write in a way that’s true to myself, I’m going to see the absurdities of things,” he says. “Even though I know they’re terribly serious, and probably many people will object. And there’s nothing I can do but wish them well, and hope the others enjoy the book.”
He also uses distance as a clarifying agent when writing about the past. “There’s something to be said for the perspective that you get from waiting and looking back,” he says. “It gives you a kind of calm, a kind of overview. If you’re too agitated, you may not see the truth.”
Despite his literary fixation on the past, the novelist often questions whether he indeed is writing about the past, or about timeless patterns of human behavior. Epstein cites the riots on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 as a testament to the fascist undertones fomenting in the United States today. “I think that those fights never end,” he says. “The battles have to be understood — which you try to do through art and fiction of all kinds, even music — and it always bears on the present.”

Before the pandemic, ONCE in Somerville was known for its wild rock shows. One of its final concerts even saw the lead singer of a band then-called PowerSlut “jump off the stage and crowd surf into a rainbow unicorn inflatable kiddie pool,” says JJ Gonson, the venue’s owner.
Gonson loved to host events like this at her venue every week; however as a result of the pandemic, ONCE was forced to permanently close its doors. Having lost the lease for her space, Gonson doesn’t know when she’ll be able to get back to hosting bands like PowerSlut again, if ever.
As vaccination rates continue to rise, the prospect of live concerts returning within the year, or even this summer, is trending more realistic than optimistic each day. Exciting as this may be, it will have to happen without ONCE and the hundreds of other independent venues across the country who were unable to make it to the finish line — and many more may still join them.
Over the past year, independent venues have faced unique challenges in surviving the pandemic, and until recently, the federal government has done little to support them. The venues that have survived are hanging by a thread, held on the other end by the support of their communities and the tenacity of their owners. One light at the end of a long tunnel, however, has been the #SaveOurStages movement, which successfully advocated for a law which allocates $16.25 billion of government funds from the most recent stimulus bill for direct support to independent venues.
Remember your last live concert? No, not when you saw Maroon 5 for a national arena tour. I mean the last packed-crowd, jumping-up-and-down, sticky-floor, eardrum-blowing concert. These are the specialty of the independent venue, live event spaces not owned by corporations — the places that cater to local artists rather than national tours. Every world-famous band has to start somewhere, right?
Emily K. Ruddock is the executive director at MASSCreative, a statewide arts and cultural advocacy organization. From her years of experience working to ensure the health of Massachusetts’ cultural sector, Ruddock recognizes the unique importance of independent music venues.
“Independent live music venues are the places where careers are born. They are the places that are deeply embedded in their communities. They know the artists, they are champions of the artists...You don’t have musicians that have long careers without these folks. And it’s small, it’s super scrappy, but it matters. It matters,” she said.
One such venue is Wally’s Cafe Jazz Club in Boston, managed by Frank F. Poindexter. Wally’s has been family-owned and operated since 1947, when it was founded by Poindexter’s grandfather, Joseph L. Walcott, after he immigrated from Barbados. Wally’s was Boston’s first integrated jazz club and since its inception has helped countless aspiring jazz musicians get their start.
“What he [Walcott] decided to do was go to the colleges that had music students studying jazz and match them with seasoned professionals who were already in here,” Poindexter said. “From the 60s until now, Wally’s has basically been known as the training ground for jazz music because of this incredible ecosystem of music education in Boston — you got Berklee College of Music, you got New England Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, Harvard has a great music program, Boston University has a great program, and a lot of number of the other institutions in the area. With that ecosystem, Wally’s is a venue where these musicians can practice to perfect their craft.”
The college students who perfected their craft at Wally’s over the years have gone on to play in big bands, win Grammys, and play late night shows like The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Wally’s even gave rise to producers like Jeff Bhasker (Kanye West, Lady Gaga) and Neil Jacobson (Billie Eilish).
“It’s just a part of all the talent that comes to Wally’s...We do live music seven days a week, three bands a day. A large number of musicians who have been educated in this area have used the stage to create their career networks,” Poindexter said.
The Comedy Studio, a comedy club owned by Rick J. Jenkins, tries to provide a similar space for aspiring comedians to hone their craft. The Comedy Studio hosted shows up to six days a week in the space above Hong Kong in Cambridge for nearly 25 years, featuring the likes of then-Harvard students Colin Jost ’04, B. J. Novak ’01, and Dan Mintz ’02.
After opening a larger dedicated space in Union Square two years ago, the Comedy Studio has tried to branch out into hosting comedy classes and workshops, alongside an open mic that aimed at giving up-and-coming comedians an opportunity to test new material and develop an audience, according to Jenkins.
“We're really trying to be more of a center for a comedy community… Independent venues are really the first stepping stone. Without the independent venue, there is no feeder system for entertainment as an industry,” Jenkins said.
Those who operate independent venues are deeply invested in their local communities, hosting events that feature local talent and cater to local tastes.
Before the pandemic, Gonson enjoyed hosting a wide variety of community events at ONCE — from performances by local bands to a full production of Hair, the Boston Rock Opera, wrestling matches, and the Rock and Roll Rumble, a nine-night competition of local music.
Sam J. Epstein, the owner of another Somerville venue, The Jungle, looks forward to restartarting its Wednesday night open-mic tradition:
“So it’s kind of just a night for the musicians. We would see the same musicians coming back every Wednesday night, and that was the coolest thing for me because they weren’t booked to play, they were just a community of local musicians who heard about us, came by, and liked it… the music is always so reliable and such a great experience. And so that’s cool for me to see musicians performing one after another just all night long,” Epstein said.
Until the pandemic, the Regent Theatre in Arlington was in continuous operation for over a century. Its current owner, Leland D. Stein, emphasized its goal of bringing people together through music, theater, and film.
“When we were suddenly shut down last March, the financial devastation was real, but really what affected me personally more was the sudden loss of community,” he said.
Beyond conventional entertainment, the Regent has also been known to host baptisms, engagements, weddings, and even a sold-out Harvard symposium on “the revived interest in the use of psychedelic mushrooms and micro doses in psychotherapy,” including a feature film and panel discussion. Anything the community is interested in, the Regent is eager to support, Stein said.
On the other hand, venues owned by corporations with shareholders and management bureaucracy have much less flexibility on the types of events they can host, tending to gravitate towards booking artists that are much more established. They’re unlikely to know about niche community interest or local artists who are up-and-coming, much less take a chance on them and book them to perform.
“The people who book our clubs know the local tastes...They can predict if this artist would be a good fit here to help develop. You have to know your audience, and you can’t know your audience by phoning it in or looking at a spreadsheet,” said Audrey Fix Schaefer, director of communications at the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), a nonprofit coalition of independent venue owners that was formed at the start of the pandemic.
Although venues like House of Blues in Boston (owned by Live Nation, which is headquartered in California), or The Sinclair in Cambridge (owned by The Bowery Presents, headquartered in New York), might come to mind when one thinks of a “local concert venue” in the greater Boston area, they play a markedly different role in the music industry ecosystem than do independent venues like ONCE, albeit an equally important one.
“[Corporate venues] serve a very specific purpose, which is to bring touring acts to a certain level. There’s a lot of a lot of handshaking going on — I’ll book your band this time, but the next time this guy comes through, they come to me — It’s a whole thing. And it’s done with those people at a national level, as opposed to locally,” Gonson said. “An independent venue is sort of feeling through the market a little more on the ground, or maybe is actually headquartered in the place that it’s operated in.”
Unable to curate live events amidst the pandemic, many venue owners have turned to streaming shows to keep their communities together. Even without a physical space, ONCE has produced virtual programming on its YouTube channel, which has streamed over 100 shows with local artists.
“The whole motivation when we started this was really about not losing track of our community and making sure that artists were able to make art, and that we could support local music and all those things that we care about, because they are what keep us alive spiritually. And it actually really has helped a lot I think, personally. It helps a lot socially for us to feel like we can see each other and be together,” Gonson said.
Gonson has also worked to keep her community alive by helping to start Save MA Stages, the Massachusetts chapter of NIVA. The organization has disseminated information from NIVA, making sure as many venues as possible are able to take advantage of opportunities for support, and served as a meeting place for venue owners to collaborate and amplify their collective voice.
Although independent venues play such an important role in local communities and the entertainment industry at large by giving local artists their start, they have struggled to stay afloat through the challenges of the pandemic.
Live entertainment venues were among the first businesses to shut down at the onset of the pandemic and will be the last to reopen. And, unlike restaurants or retail businesses, it’s virtually impossible for independent venues to make any income in the meantime. You certainly can’t call up a venue and order a live concert for curbside pickup.
“If there was no emergency relief from the federal government, 90 percent of NIVA venues expected that they would go under. Hundreds did — and hundreds did because the relief didn’t come fast enough,” said Fix Schaefer. Since March 2020, the arts and culture sector has reported over $15 billion in lost revenue nationally according to Americans for the Arts.
These staggering statistics are due in part to the nature of the live entertainment industry, which operates on incredibly thin margins and is highly competitive. Overwhelmingly, those who work in live entertainment take their profits in the shared appreciation of music, art, and cultural community, not cash. Breaking even is considered a success.
Even within the live entertainment industry, independent venues also face unique challenges compared to their corporate-owned counterparts. As Fix Schaefer explained, “Independent venues don’t have the financial backstops of publicly traded companies that have shareholders. Multinationals certainly have access to Wall Street credit lines that independent venues don’t.”
In the greater Boston area, venues have felt these challenges firsthand. According to Ruddock, alarm bells were already being wrung about the lack of creative space, with venues like The Middle East in Central Square going on sale.
“We’re seeing other venues that had been stalwarts of the independent music scene disappearing. I think the real tragedy of this moment is we saw an acceleration of that,” Ruddock said. Venues in Massachusetts reported $483 million in pandemic-related losses between March and November according to the Mass Cultural Council.
While these losses are significant in and of themselves, they multiply further considering the impact venues have on nearby restaurants, hotels, and stores, among other businesses. A 2019 economic impact study in Chicago showed that every dollar spent at a small music venues generated $12 of economic activity for area businesses.
“That’s an ‘oh wow’ kind of a statistic which tells elected officials that by giving support to a venue that’s been shuttered you are not just allowing it to hold on until it’s safe to reopen — you are protecting the economic engine that will drive renewal for your communities,” said Fix Schaefer.
This economic effect is not just about incentivizing locals to spend more money — it also comes from people traveling from out of town, out of state even, to attend an event. Restaurants and retail can’t drive tourism by themselves in the same way.
The erosion of small businesses as a result of the pandemic was not ignored by the federal government, but little attention was paid into how independent venues fit into the picture of general economic relief.
The $2 trillion CARES Act introduced the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides forgivable loans from the government that businesses can use to stay afloat as their revenue takes a significant hit as a result of the pandemic. However, what poses an existential challenge for the live events industry is that independent venues are essentially ineligible to use these loans in their intended way.
Sixty percent of PPP loans must be used for payroll, and businesses have to either keep on their employees or rehire them at the end of their 24-week loan period in order to have the loan forgiven. For independent venues who have had no idea when they will be able to reopen and whose businesses have been illegal to operate in the interim, taking a PPP loan would likely do more harm than good. Such was the case for Wally’s, Poindexter said.
“At the time that opportunity was offered to us, the rules were still in fluctuation. So, for a small business owner, we would have had to take on possibly even more debt. And we would not have known what our obligation would be when the term of that loan became due,” he said.
In addition to direct federal aid, state governments also bear the responsibility of providing the necessary support to its businesses. However, State Sen. Ed Kennedy, a Democrat who co-chairs the Tourism, Arts, and Cultural Development Joint Committee of the Massachusetts State Legislature, explained that independent venues have had to compete with a wide array of interested parties for state funding.
“We’ve got the vaccine issue going on. Unemployment benefits are a big issue. And so there are other needs for public funds besides entertainment venues, so it will just be a matter of convincing everybody that these venues are important and that they should get some public funding,” he said.
Mercedes S. Roman-Manson, communications and marketing manager at the Massachusetts Live Events Coalition, also emphasized that beyond the businesses themselves, venues employ a large and diverse network of workers.
“There are technical staff, bussers, food and beverage staff, people that park cars, people that work the front of the house, merch people...wedding planners, event planners, rental companies, lighting companies, sound companies, it’s just a huge amount of people,” she said.
Compounding the danger to independent venues is the fact that many of their employees are contract workers who work on a 1099 tax basis rather than a W2, making it even more difficult to get pandemic unemployment assistance.
In light of these unprecedented challenges, venue owners have had to become fierce advocates for their own businesses’ welfare.
This began last March, when a coalition of venue owners came together to form NIVA which has worked tirelessly to advocate for public support tailored to the needs of its now more than 3,000 independent venue members nationwide.
NIVA quickly launched the #SaveOurStages initiative, which sought to pressure Congress to enact tailored pandemic relief specific to independent entertainment venues. According to Fix Schaefer, NIVA worked with lobbying firm Akin Gump to inform its political strategy, and, through grassroots organizing and social media campaigns, was able to encourage over 2.1 million people to send emails for its cause. Yet, despite this early momentum, NIVA was unable to get legislation to the floor before Congress’s July 4 recess last year.
“We were just absolutely devastated. But we knew ‘Okay, they’ll come back, we’ll come back, and we’re gonna keep fighting for this,’ because we have no other choice,” Fix Schaefer said.
As the fight for the relief legislation, which came to be known as the Save Our Stages Act, was ongoing, NIVA also organized Save Our Stages Fest, a three-day virtual music festival that took place in October. This benefit event kickstarted a donation campaign for the NIVA Emergency Relief Fund, which has since raised over $3 million and offered grants to 153 venues.
Save Our Stages Fest was streamed simultaneously from more than 25 different independent venues across the country, each hosting artists like Miley Cyrus, Dave Matthews Band, and Demi Lovato, among others — many of whom had history at the venues at which they performed.
Ted M. Kartzman, who works as Independent Music Partnerships Manager at YouTube (owned by Google), helped organize Save Our Stages Fest by sourcing equipment for all of the participating venues. The event was streamed using cameras donated by Google and supplied by Big Room TV, a company which has engineered artificial intelligence software that is able to autonomously operate several recording cameras, alternating different shooting angles and producing the final stream without any human intervention.
This technology helped to make the event safer for the performers by requiring less crew on hand. As an added benefit, venues who received this equipment were able to keep it permanently, enabling them to pursue their own streaming shows in a safe and cost effective manner and bring in revenue for the remainder of the pandemic.
Kartzman also facilitated equipment donations to Wally’s even though it was undergoing renovations at the time of Save Our Stages Fest because he had an experience there he’ll never forget.
“In the-mid 90s I was there, and I saw this incredible jazz meets funk night and just will never forget the venue. And that, to me, is the independent venue. They’ve been around for generations, and so many people have had these experiences. That’s a treasure that we can’t lose,” he said.
The Big Room TV equipment has enabled Wally’s to pursue streaming shows to make extra revenue while it remains closed.
“They’ve given us tremendous information on assisting us pivoting to a streaming service, and how to leverage the YouTube platform in order to present content to a wider audience, which could lead to merchandising opportunities,” Poindexter said.
Despite this generous donation from Google organized by Kartzman, Wally’s has survived primarily only through the tenacity of Poindexter’s family, who applied for small grants and debt funding to cover operational costs, and support from the local community, which recognized Wally’s irreplaceable cultural value by donating through GoFundMe.
Kennedy, the state senator, has also been working to help Massachusetts’ treasured independent venues by considering subsidies for reduced capacity operations for the summer.
“I’’ve been in touch with other senators in the Massachusetts Senate about seeing what venues are doing and what kind of money is going to be needed in order for them to be successful, or at least to stay in the black this year should they choose to operate,” he said.
Subsidizing reduced capacity events would enable venues to begin to rebuild their cultural community without having to toe the precarious line between safety and profitability. As Kennedy seeks support for this funding, venues can also apply for grants from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation.
Although the Massachusetts state legislature and Mass Cultural Council has worked to make funding available for its arts and culture sectors, not all local governments have been as sympathetic. For Alexis Richardson, a musician and Somerville resident, not knowing when she will be able to perform again has taken a significant toll on her livelihood.
“We kind of feel like we’re not really being looked after and we’re not really being taken seriously,” she said.
According to the Mass Cultural Council, individual creative workers in Massachusetts have reported more than $20 million in lost income between March and November 2020. Artists like Richardson facing this challenge thought they could rely on the local government to consider their needs but for months, she said, the city of Somerville worked against her.
As Massachusetts entered Phase III, Step 1 of reopening at the end of July, activities such as indoor swimming pools, indoor hockey, and sporting events became permissible with certain restrictions, as well as live music events at social distanced capacity, including at restaurants.
However, despite entering this step and permitting all of the former sporting events to take place, the city of Somerville placed a specific ordinance outlawing outdoor music performance of any kind at restaurants and venues, even though they were deemed to be equal risk by the state.
Richardson frequently plays at Epstein’s venue, The Jungle; however, despite Epstein’s efforts to create a safe socially-distanced area for musicians to perform on his venue-turned-restaurant’s outdoor patio, Richardson was not able to perform there.
“Somerville is the only city in the state that put an extra rule in place and said there can be no radio, no live music, no music performance at all whatsoever. And it was really just to look tough on corona,” Epstein said.
Epstein and Richardson teamed up with Somerville city councilor Wilfred Mbah, who helped them draft and present an order in December which pledged to musicians and venues that the city would have greater transparency and consistency on its Covid-19 regulations. “It was passed unanimously. Every city councilor voted yes, that this was an overstep and it was basically just scapegoating musicians without protecting public health,” Epstein said.
Fortunately for venues that have managed to survive the pandemic year without effective public support, help is finally on the way. Despite failing to pass the Save Our Stages Act by its initial goal last summer, NIVA did not stop pushing.
The Save Our Stages Act, which was initially sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas), eventually amassed 220 co-sponsors. The bill had bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress, which Schaefer remarks is “wildly unusual.” Over 1,000 artists signed letters to members of Congress to support the bill, as well. After months of growing public sentiment and political momentum, the Save Our Stages Act passed on Dec. 21, 2020.
The original law appropriated $15 billion from the most recent Covid-19 relief bill to be specifically earmarked for independent entertainment venues. But the amount was extended by $1.25 billion through an amendment spearheaded by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). In addition to extra funding, the amendment addressed some shortcomings of the original legislation.
First, the amendment earmarked $840,000 for the Small Business Administration, which is tasked with distributing the funds, to help make the application process as accessible as possible. Second, it eliminated an earlier provision barring venues from accepting a second-round PPP loan, the funding for which was made available much earlier than the new funding would arrive.
Instead of having to choose between a sooner payout and the chance at a larger one — which Ruddock indicated was a real concern for venues in Massachusetts — venues can now take a PPP2 loan and then apply for the new program and have the prior PPP2 money deducted from their new award.
Now-totaling $16.25 billion, the funds available through the Save Our Stages Act will be distributed in the form of Shuttered Venue Operator Grants, which will offer a single sum up to 45 percent of venues’ 2019 revenue, capped at $10 million. The grants will go out first to venues who have lost over 90 percent of their revenue in the pandemic, with eligibility increasing every two weeks to venues that took less of a financial hit.
In order to be eligible, venues must meet a long list of specific criteria, including being privately owned, having less than 500 employees, and operating in less than 10 states, among other restrictions. Two billion of the total appropriations are also set aside specifically for venues with less than 50 employees.
The SBA began accepting applications for these grants on April 8. For the venue operators who have held on this long, the promise of recouping nearly half of lost revenues gives them a lot of hope.
Stein noted that the grant will allow him to “take a breath” and hold over his business until it can resume normal operations, which he tentatively targets for the fall. Jenkins highlighted his gratitude that his business was included in the SVOG program as a comedy club. “A little lifeline could go a long way,” he said.
Epstein expressed gratitude to have received such overwhelming support from community donations to government grants. “We really need it all,” he said.
In addition to the federal SVOG program, forthcoming aid on the state level might be able to provide even more support to independent venues — and other cultural institutions like museums, which were not prioritized in the Save Our Stages Act. Kennedy sponsored a bill (SD.2105) in the Massachusetts state legislature called An Act to Rebuild the Commonwealth’s Cultural Future, which would create a $200 million fund for many kinds of cultural businesses and organizations. Whether it will pass in the state legislature remains to be seen.
While many venues are enthusiastic about these upcoming opportunities for aid, for those that have already lost their spaces or closed their businesses entirely, this relief might be coming too late.
“I do know that the ones that are open are very excited about this, and it’ll make a huge difference. But, I don’t know what’s gonna happen with us [ONCE], because we closed,” Gonson said. “We’re trying to find a new space, but we don't have one yet.”
Though independent venues have demonstrated incredible resilience, public support still remains vital. To join the fight to keep these businesses alive, you can fill out this support form for the Act to Rebuild the Commonwealth’s Cultural Future, donate to the NIVA Emergency Relief Fund which continues to provide grants to venues in need, or simply purchase merchandise or attend a streaming show of a venue in your local area. If the past year has taught us anything, hopefully it’s not to underestimate how much independent venues need us — and more importantly, how much we need them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of isolation, Beverly Cleary’s 1983 Newbery-winning “Dear Mr. Henshaw” takes on new meaning, as protagonist Leigh navigates an unromanticized and bittersweet childhood full of loneliness and struggles against an elusive father figure. One look at Cleary’s book, and “Dear Mr. Henshaw” stands out as sad; far sadder than any of her other works. In fact, as she explained in a 2019 interview for WETA, Cleary wrote “Dear Mr. Henshaw” at the behest of two letters from children asking for a book about a child of divorce. “And I had never thought about it, but I said I’d — give it a try,” she said.
That ‘try’ produced one of her more lasting additions to the children’s literary canon.
“Dear Mr. Henshaw” is a thoroughly lonely book, perhaps more fitting for pandemic times than the more popular and numerous volumes of the Henry Huggins or Ramona Quimby series — both of which feature social, middle-class adolescence on Klickitat Street in Portland, Ore. There, the “Charlie Brown” or “Arthur”-like neighborhood is always bustling with cheery children and parents whose funny adventures around town entertain and inspire a young reader. Even the Ellen Tebbits series, though separate from the others, also takes place in Portland and details such problems as putting up with obnoxious boys and wearing embarrassing woolen underwear.
The Huggins and Quimby families represent a romanticized mid-century middle-class American upbringing, with the nostalgia of Norman Rockwell and the sensibilities of Dick van Dyke, but like those peer illustrations of an American life, fail to represent those for whom that life isn’t true.
Main character Leigh Botts is sequestered from the other Cleary characters in Central California, without a neighborhood of other children to drive his life forward, almost without a neighborhood at all. He details his home upgrade from a trailer outside of Bakersfield to a “garden cottage,” “all we can afford” in Pacific Grove upon his parents’ divorce. The comfortable, almost silly life of Henry Huggins is completely foreign to Leigh: There is no paper route or pesky siblings. Their life, like a continuous Saturday, contrasts with Leigh’s more grave, Monday-like existence. There are brutal conversations about marriage, love, and the idea that some adults simply aren’t good role models.
The epistolary narrative, beginning as letters to children’s author Boyd Henshaw, only emphasizes Leigh’s loneliness. Mr. Henshaw’s replies are omitted, leaving the reader to infer their contents from Leigh’s responses. If the reader expects an eventual meeting between the two correspondents, they are sure to be disappointed — Mr. Henshaw never appears, as if Cleary is calling into question his realness. In the second half of the book, Leigh begins to write diary entries, now addressed “Dear Mr. Pretend Henshaw,” but there is no difference between the two addressees. Mr. Henshaw and Mr. Pretend Henshaw are the same person: merely a dummy object to receive Leigh’s introspection.
That introspection is as honest as it is sour. The whitewashed American nuclear family so central to Cleary’s other books — two parents, children, and a dog or cat — is completely destroyed, dog and all, with all of the stinging details of divorce on display. Leigh’s struggles with a near-absent father — who forgets to call and visit, loses Leigh’s dog, and gets caught with another family — take the place of the more traditional adventure-based plots of Cleary’s other works. The emotional climax of the book, when Leigh and his mother cry together on a rainy night, is as far as Cleary is willing to go in portraying the ugly side of life.
Even Leigh’s successes are borne of isolation. Leigh’s story, “A Day on Dad’s Rig,” receives praise from famous children’s author Angela Badger for its honesty, though Leigh is at first uninterested in Badger, because she “writes mostly about girls with problems like big feet or pimples or something,” a nod to some of Cleary’s other works. Here Cleary inserts herself into the story to give writing advice to young children: that writing is therapeutic, and honesty and individuality above all else makes the best writer. Leigh’s other achievement is an engineering project: a working alarm on his lunchbox, to keep his lunches from being stolen. This endeavor leads him closer to Barry, Leigh’s only friend in the book, and Mr. Fridley, the father-like school custodian, acting as a lighthearted foil plot to the woes of divorce. It is in these episodes that Cleary’s classic charm shines through the most, as if it were really what she wants to write about.
It takes a sequel, “Strider,” written eight years after “Dear Mr. Henshaw,” for a more hopeful Leigh to appear: one with friends, hobbies, and a romantic interest (and a new dog). But taken alone, “Dear Mr. Henshaw” shows Leigh at his emotional worst, an important model for children who could be going through similar feelings.
Beverly Cleary will be remembered as a writer of sunny children’s books. Her penchant for portraying suburban adventures, relatable family trivialities, and a sympathetic animal world cement her works in the pantheon of formative novels for elementary schoolers. Ask any Cleary reader about her books, and while Ramona Quimby will necessarily come up, Leigh Botts might not. But it is important to remember Leigh: though not Cleary’s favorite character, a necessary one for young readers to be exposed to. Not everyone is so lucky to grow up on Klickitat Street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard community has spoken. An unprecedented coalition of students, faculty, and staff is calling on the administration to designate Election Day an instruction-free “Democracy Day” — a University holiday that would institutionalize voting and civic engagement at Harvard for all U.S. federal elections beginning in 2022.
The movement for Democracy Day has united the Harvard community, transcending schools, Harvard affiliations, and political leanings. The Harvard Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate Council both unanimously passed a joint resolution signaling their support, as have all 12 graduate school student government bodies; a Community Letter has received more than 200 signatures from Harvard faculty, as well as hundreds more from students, staff, and alumni; and student organizations that span the political spectrum — including both Harvard College and Harvard Law School Republicans and Democrats — all stand in support of Democracy Day.
Beyond this extraordinary cross-campus support, the justification for Democracy Day can be found within Harvard’s institutional commitments. Harvard’s mission is to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” While voting does not define the scope of engaged citizenship, voting may very well be “the first responsibility of citizenship in a democracy,” as University President Lawrence S. Bacow himself noted in last year’s convocation address.
Further, Harvard has publicly committed itself to achieving 100 percent eligible voter registration, engagement, and turnout. To say that Harvard has repeatedly fallen short of this goal, however, would be a grave understatement. In 2014, only 22 percent of voting-eligible students cast a ballot; in 2016, only 58 percent; and in 2018, only 49 percent.
Absent comparable data for Harvard staff (including our dining, janitorial, and facilities staff), we should be careful not to assume their voting rates are necessarily higher, especially given Harvard’s current employee policy which urges employees to not ask for time off to vote unless doing so is “necessary.”
We can, and must, do better as an entire Harvard community. The administration’s statements hailing the importance of civic engagement are undermined by its current policy of treating Election Day like any other day on the University calendar. Democracy Day would free students and staff of class and work commitments that are known to discourage Election Day-voting. It would also institutionalize and elevate the importance of civic engagement as a Harvard community.
Democracy Day, per its concept paper, would be a day of learning, celebration, reflection, and, most of all, civic action. For instance, Democracy Day’s programming would include opportunities to serve as a poll worker or poll watcher, teach civics lessons to local elementary schoolers, join get-out-the-vote efforts, or participate in dialogues about democracy in America and around the world. In this way, Democracy Day would be inclusive of all members of the Harvard community, not only its eligible voters.
Several other higher education institutions, including Brown University and Columbia University, have already taken this important step of designating Election Day a university holiday. Brown held a faculty vote in September 2020 on the matter, with 80 percent of its faculty voting in favor of designating Election Day a university holiday. As ongoing efforts at other schools continue, and with private companies similarly institutionalizing their own Election Day holidays, Harvard cannot lag behind when it comes to civic engagement.
President Bacow faces a critical choice — and he can choose to have Harvard be a national leader in this moment. While other institutions have designated Election Day a university holiday, none have committed themselves to civic engagement in the way that Democracy Day asks of Harvard. Democracy Day would go a step further than a general holiday, activating University resources to ensure that every member of the Harvard community may engage in participatory citizenship.
Indeed, Democracy Day’s robust programming requires thoughtful planning and strong institutional support. This is why we are calling on the administration to immediately announce the establishment of a Democracy Day Commission, so that we can begin planning, together, the best possible Democracy Day in preparation for November 2022.
Ultimately, Democracy Day is about more than voting or helping work the polls — it is about our values as a Harvard community. Holidays commemorate days that matter to us, and allow us to express who we are and what we stand for. Especially in a time when democracy has been challenged both domestically and abroad, Democracy Day allows us as a Harvard community to speak — and actually live by — our stated democratic values.
Democracy Day aligns with Harvard’s mission, brings us closer to our goal of 100 percent voter turnout, encourages all members of the Harvard community to deepen their civic engagement, models best practices for other higher educational institutions, and enshrines engaged citizenship as a core Harvard community value. It also has the support of all of Harvard’s student governments, as well hundreds of Harvard faculty, staff, and alumni.
President Bacow, we call on you to institutionalize Democracy Day in 2022 and beyond. For one day of the academic calendar, Harvard should commit itself to taking the civic lessons taught inside its classrooms and applying them towards civic action to benefit the community. Only then can Harvard make good on its mission “to educate citizens and citizen leaders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Joe Biden recently announced the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion proposal to rebuild crumbling transportation infrastructure, decarbonize the economy, and deliver clean water and high-speed broadband while advancing environmental justice and socioeconomic equality.
The bill, seen by many Democrats as a necessary investment, has received significant backlash from Republicans, including Senator John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) who said the plan was an “out-of-control socialist spending spree” outlining “the left’s radical agenda.”
It seems that Republicans cry socialism every time Democrats propose something they deem too expensive or progressive. The critique is uniformly applied to politicians across the liberal spectrum from centrists like Biden to Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), even though Sanders is notably a democratic socialist, not a socialist.
What is perhaps even more bizarre than this conservative strategy is that Democrats have done little to systematically fight this false characterization. Additionally, many liberal Harvard students perpetuate the problem by using the terms interchangeably while nonetheless believing in capitalist democratic socialist policies, not traditionally socialist ones.
Informing American voters about the distinction between socialism, democratic socialism, and capitalism could take away a powerful — and inaccurate — tool Republicans use to impede discussions about Democrat’s priorities on topics like climate change and systemic racism.
First, let’s agree on some basic definitions.
Capitalism is the dominant global economic system, wherein a country’s means of production are privately owned, and production and income distribution are determined largely through the operation of unregulated markets, apart from minimal government intervention. Socialism, the antithesis of capitalism, is a social and economic theory that calls for public rather than private ownership, in which everyone who contributes to the production of a good is entitled to a share in it.
Democratic socialism is difficult to define because of its range of interpretations among supporters. Sanders champions the movement to “reform a political system which is corrupt” and “create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy.” For Sanders, democratic socialist policies include expanding voting access and medical care, improving workplace democracy, increasing taxes on the wealthy, and promoting environmental and economic justice through the Green New Deal (which, by the way, in no way advocates for the government to take over the means of production).
Looking closely at his definition of democratic socialism and various proposals to implement it, Sanders never argues for an all-powerful government bureaucracy. Rather, he proposes democratization of our political and economic system through government intervention. These interventions and regulations may be farther reaching than most members of Congress support, but that doesn’t make him — or other progressive politicians — socialists.
Republicans have good reason to reject socialism. It has never been implemented fully or purely in history, leaving questions remaining about how it would work in practice. When components have been adopted, as in 1920s Vienna, China after 1949, and Cuba since 1959, self-described socialist political parties have seized power for themselves to the detriment of their supposed egalitarian values.
With this caveat considered, Republicans crying socialism is nonetheless a gross mischaracterization of progressive policies. So how then did this pattern come about in the first place?
Republicans’ hysteria around minimal government regulation can be traced back to the Reagan era. Viennese political theorist Friedrick Hayek argued in his 1944 book “The Road to Serfdom” that socialism “would concentrate power in the state in a manner similar to that in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.” Though Hayek advocated “for a ‘middle way’ between state socialism and unstructured capitalism,” Keynes later argued that Hayek’s failure to determine how much regulation was too much suggests that any move towards economic planning will launch society “on the slippery path which will lead you in due course over the precipice.”
Reagan’s economic advisors interpreted Hayek’s work to support their free-market principles. Ever since, a significant portion of the American population has associated perceived “big government” with socialism and socialism with totalitarianism. Even though Hayek never argued that regulation alone could precipitate a socialist dystopia, the merger of the two in Americans’ consciousness has enabled Republicans to call pro-regulation Democrats socialists.
If we are going to take practical steps to address the extraordinary socioeconomic inequality and environmental degradation America’s underregulated capitalist market helped produce, Americans must stop associating regulation with socialism. Unfortunately, Republicans are not going to stop utilizing this effective — albeit inaccurate — critique. At least not until Democrats do something to counter this distorted narrative.
Democrats and their supporters can more effectively dispel this myth by clearly differentiating between socialism and regulations. Sanders could distinguish democratic socialism from communism and socialism during speeches. Instead of feeding into the misconception, as Biden did when he stated “I beat the socialist” shortly after winning the Democratic nomination over Sanders, centrist Democrats could support progressive allies by using accurate terminology. The Democratic Party could also initiate an educational campaign about democratic socialism similar to the coordinated 2020 voter outreach push.
Progressive Democratic supporters, and in particular democratic socialists at Harvard, can also play a role. We too are often called radical socialists and delegitimized as such, even though the vast majority of Harvard students in my experience support some variety of regulated capitalism, not socialism.
We are all entitled to advocate for the causes we believe in. Let’s stop letting misguided labels interfere with legitimate discussions about how we are going to move forward. Calling them misinformation is a good first step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’ve seen the image by now (if not, scroll up). Members of the Harvard branch of the Ku Klux Klan pose, in full regalia, for a 1924 graduation photo huddled around our campus’s most renowned landmark: the John Harvard Statue. Slacks and dress shoes poke out from their robes. One Harvard Klansman cheekily straddles John Harvard and turns his head to the camera. The group looks defiantly calm — almost as if they’d already guessed our University’s then lax stance towards their ideology.
The pictured students were, per a recent deep dive into the KKK’s Harvard’s ties by Crimson staff writer Simon J. Levien ’23-24, only one testament to the white supremacist group’s pervasive presence on our campus throughout the 20th century.
In the 1950s, freshmen carried out a cross burning in the corner of Harvard Yard where the handful of Black students in Harvard’s freshman class primarily lived. In the ’20s, Harvard Klansmen ran a “klanidate” to oppose Cambridge’s mayor, who disparaged and threatened to disband Harvard’s chapter. Through the ’90s, incidents speaking to the Klan’s continued influence, such as the appearance of KKK leaflets, graffiti, and propaganda on campus, persisted. Harvard’s administration, to the present, largely remained silent.
Despite the Klan’s tendency to operate in “considerable secrecy,” a robust archival record of its presence and dynamics exists (to the curious: try searching The Crimson’s website). So why did it take decades and significant personal effort on behalf of a student to illuminate our bleak past?
We commend our fellow Crimson staffer for helping unearth one of our University’s darkest and most startlingly unexcavated chapters. His work, like that of other college journalists before him, highlights the potential of student journalism as a source of accountability separate from our institutions, through which students may unveil important yet deeply inconvenient truths.
The history Levien has dutifully brought forth is painful; the image itself, jarring and the work altogether urgent. Yet we can’t help but regret that the story didn’t come earlier and from Harvard itself, full account and apology hand in hand.
Levien’s research into the Crimson Klan represents exactly the kind of tale that needs to be told if we are to genuinely and accurately reckon with our institution’s past. That the KKK did not come up in existing institutional attempts at historical reckoning reveals flaws in Harvard’s current efforts to reexamine its old self.
Back in 2019, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the creation of the $5 million Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery to, in his words “help the university gain important insights about our past and the enduring legacy of slavery.” The program, however, rarely delves into the 20th century, focusing on our earlier, more temporally distant ties to slavery and racism rather than our palpably shameful recent past. It appears that no one involved in the initiative knew of Harvard’s Klu Klux Klan chronicles or thought to investigate the topic.
Yet what is the legacy of slavery — of the founding of the United States upon the pillars of white supremacy and the absolute exploitation of Black people — if not virulent racism, which the KKK so brazenly and uniformly represents? Investigating slavery’s legacy necessarily includes examining the dynamics and abuses, modern and past, that follow from such a premise. It is then alarming that it fell upon a student journalist to unearth Harvard’s relationship with the Klan rather than Harvard’s multi-million dollar Legacy of Slavery initiative, funded expressly to investigate its namesake. If the initiative does not consider studying Harvard’s literal Klu Klux Klan chapter under its purview, what exactly is?
The short-sighted and, at worst, purposefully evasive approach to investigating Harvard’s relationship with slavery and its legacy (racism) leaves us wondering whether the initiative’s aim is constructive engagement with the past — understanding pain caused and wrongs in need of righting — or mere historical navel-gazing.
Far too often, the burden of “unearthing” these past examples of white supremacy has fallen on the backs of Black people, as the victims of bigotry become the main and often only chroniclers of their victimization. And so it was through the words of J. Max Bond Jr. ’55, a Black student who was forced to witness a cross burning outside his dorm, that we learned of its existence following Levien’s publicizing of his account. If the Legacy of Slavery initiative is to succeed, the University has a responsibility to offer alternative epistemological paths forward: ones that protect students from having to constantly retell and relive their painful experiences for the sake of combating white supremacy and the historical record.
The creation of a 20th-century subcommittee within the initiative is thus long overdue — as is an analysis of how former racially exclusionary practices might still shape campus dynamics. The latter might prove surprisingly insightful: Levien’s own article revealed, for example, that presenting discrimination as something funny (the Lampoon’s crass 2019 joke about Anne Frank comes to mind) is a campus trend and rather than a new campus phenomenon: Harvard’s 1952 cross burning was written off as a “prank” by administrators at the time.
It is worth remembering that some 1920s Harvard Klansmen thought having a collegiate chapter at the “100 percent American” Harvard was redundant — the quoted phrase equating Americanness with whiteness, and a Waspy slice of it at that. In other words: KKK members thought that, through upholding white supremacist and exclusionary admissions practices, Harvard was already Klan-like enough for them. In considering “our present” through the Legacy of Slavery initiative, as Bacow laid out the initiative would, Harvard must think deeply and perhaps unconventionally about how commonly accepted modern higher education practices may stand to lengthen slavery’s ugly shadow, as whites-only college admissions did then.
Crucially, inspecting our recent history might help disprove some of the most common, reductive myths about American racism. The fact that Harvard undergraduates attended bi-monthly Klan meetings speaks to how racial bigotry isn’t always a product of pitiable, teachable ignorance or geographically confined to some imagined “hillbilly” South. More work must still be done to dispel the false idea that the North is automatically anti-racist or an idealized foil to Southern slavery; Harvard, through a thorough examination of its flawed racial record, could lead the way.
Our university’s history is more than top-notch research, billionaire dropouts, and obscenely wealthy donors. The terror endured by Black students at Harvard — the scars jeering from Harvard Klansmen and the cross burning made — shouldn’t be forgotten. Its inclusion within our broader historical record might be embarrassing or disturbing, and rightly so. But it will also offer a fuller, more truthful account of what campus was truly like; one that allows students to place themselves within a nuanced and expansive continuum. A true history of our complex past — including the good, the bad, and the depressingly ugly — urgently needs writing.

Harvard professor Andrew T. Chan discussed how researchers are studying “long Covid” — a condition characterized by Covid-19 symptoms that linger after a patient initially recovers from the virus — at a Thursday event jointly hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health and radio program The World.
Elana Gordon — a global health reporter at The World, a Boston-based radio program — moderated the event, which featured talks on a Covid-19 symptom study app launched in March 2020 under Chan’s leadership. The app has collected real-time data on virus symptoms from over four million users in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Sweden.
Chan, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and immunology at the School of Public Health, explained that epidemiology studies — in which the spread of a disease and its causes are researched — are typically conducted over a long period of time. The rapid onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, made data collection via traditional methods difficult.
“We realized very early on that one of the biggest challenges of the pandemic was really being able to collect high-quality data that represented a broad segment of the population that could really give us some information about a disease that no one had ever seen before,” Chan said.
He added that the symptom-tracker app enabled his team “to provide critical, rapid data back to scientists, and also return it back to the public at large.”
According to Chan, a daily influx of patient data from the app made it possible to identify a cohort of individuals with “long Covid.” He added that between 15 and 30 percent of individuals with mild Covid-19 symptoms may develop this long-term condition.
Gordon said these patients can experience “fatigue, headache, brain fog, heart trouble, sleep problems” and more for weeks after their diagnosis. Chan added that the symptoms of long Covid can broadly be classed as neurological, gastrointestinal, or respiratory, suggesting there may be different “subtypes” of long Covid.
Chan and his team harnessed data from the symptom tracking app to make several observations about the demographic risks of contracting long Covid.
“If you had multiple symptoms, that put you at about a three-fold higher likelihood of getting long Covid, and we also found that people who were older were more likely to get long Covid,” Chan said. “Also, women were more likely to get long Covid.”
Chan noted the severity of initial Covid-19 symptoms seems to have little bearing on whether a patient develops long Covid, though he acknowledged the data considered could have been limited.
“Even people with relatively mild symptoms can end up with long Covid,” he said. “There's even some suggestion that people may be asymptomatic to start with, and then develop symptoms well after they recovered from the virus.”
Chan said there was initially skepticism among medical professionals about whether long Covid was “a real thing,” with experts suggesting that the long-term symptoms reported were not physical, but rather of “psychological” origin.
“The initial reluctance to embrace long Covid as a diagnosis, if you will, really came from deep-seated biases about how people should be able to recover from viral illnesses,” Chan said in an interview after the event. He credits much of the medical establishment’s recognition of long Covid to the work of patient advocacy groups.
As for treatment, Chan said the health care system will need to take a holistic approach — one that involves professionals with “different specializations and different backgrounds of expertise” and “multidisciplinary care.”
Though Chan said he is optimistic that medical experts will address long Covid “in a cohesive way,” he remains concerned about the condition’s long-term societal impacts.
“We're at a tipping point where I think we're really going to potentially see even higher reports of long Covid,” he said. “The impact of that on our workforce and our society I think will be felt for many years to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Producer and actor Viola Davis will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2021 Woman of the Year, the organization announced Friday.
Davis is known for her roles in films such as “Fences,” “Suicide Squad,” “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” “The Help,” and “Widows,” as well as the television series “How to Get Away with Murder.”
One of Time Magazine’s most influential people in the world in both 2012 and 2017, Davis is the first African American actor to win the combination of Academy Award, Emmy Award, and Tony Award for acting — a trifecta commonly referred to as the “triple crown” of acting — following her Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her role in “Fences” at the 89th Academy Awards in 2017.
Davis also received the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’s Artist of the Year Award in 2017.
Event coordinator and producer Natalie F. Needle ’21 said in an April 16 press release that the organization is “excited” to honor Davis with the award during “a historic and difficult year for the arts.”
“We’re very excited to honor Viola Davis as our 71st Woman of the year because of her immense impact in Hollywood,” Needle said.
Hasty Pudding President Jessica Moore ’21 lauded Davis for her continual commitment to her craft and influence in the entertainment industry.
“Viola has inspired our company with her incredible grit and determination, and we cannot wait to celebrate her successes, strong character, and wonderful talent,” Moore said in the release.
Traditionally, the Woman of the Year recipient is paraded through Harvard Square alongside Pudding members, culminating in a celebratory roast in Farkas Hall.
This year, however, the organization will present Davis with the award virtually on Thursday, April 22 at 9 p.m. The online event will open with a “short celebratory roast” for Davis and conclude with her acceptance speech. The ceremony will only be open to the organization’s “company, alumni, and loyal patron base,” according to the press release.
Since 1951, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals — the oldest social club in the United States — has presented its Woman of the Year award annually to female performers who have made “lasting and impressive contributions” to the entertainment scene.
Davis will join a cohort of highly influential female celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock, and most recently Elizabeth Banks, the 70th Woman of the Year.
“The Suicide Squad,” Davis’ upcoming film in which she portrays Amanda Waller, is scheduled to premiere in theatres on Aug. 6.
The Pudding has yet to announce its 2021 Man of the Year.

Four months before he lost his battle with brain cancer in 2009, U.S. Sen. Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54-’56 penned a letter to then-Harvard President Drew G. Faust to outline his vision for the future of Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
The letter — meant to serve as “a formal amendment” to a founding document written by Robert F. Kennedy ’48 when the IOP was established in 1966 — requested that key oversight roles at the IOP remain in the hands of the Institute’s Senior Advisory Committee, a group of bipartisan political figures and Kennedy family members tasked with steering the Institute.
In Ted Kennedy’s letter, which has not been previously reported, he asked that a direct descendant of his brother — President John F. Kennedy ’40, to whom the IOP is dedicated — continue to sit on, and play a key role in leading, the committee.
Just over a decade later, in early 2020, Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 — JFK’s daughter — was presented with a proposed IOP governance structure that violated many of her uncle’s dying requests. Shortly after, she resigned from the Senior Advisory Committee, of which she was the honorary chair.
In the year since, she has declined to elaborate on her decision to depart. Previously unreported documents obtained by The Crimson reveal that it came due to unaddressed concerns over the governance, performance, and leadership of the IOP.
“The current frustration stems from a sense that the IOP is not holding itself to a high-enough standard, not innovating, and not executing its existing programming as well as it should,” Caroline Kennedy wrote in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow last June, four months after her resignation.
Held up as a model and copied at more than a dozen universities nationwide, the IOP has a rich history as a non-academic institute focused on providing public service opportunities to undergraduates — despite its home within the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, a graduate school. Its John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum events and study groups with fellows allow undergraduates to rub shoulders with some of the nation’s top political figures, while other programs offer College students public service leadership and volunteer opportunities.
Historic Kennedy family documents never previously made public reveal, though, that there have long been fears that the IOP’s placement within the Kennedy School could jeopardize its independence and undergraduate-focused mission.
Those fears have come to a head under current Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf, who has asserted more control over the IOP than his predecessors, leaving some Senior Advisory Committee members feeling unable to address substantive concerns that have emerged under the leadership of IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78. Persistent staffing issues have led to overwork among students and staff, while student members have raised questions about transparency, undergraduate focus, and diversity at the Institute.
In the year since Caroline Kennedy left, governance tensions have persisted, driving multiple other members of the Senior Advisory Committee to resign, documents show. Elmendorf has attempted to clarify the role of the SAC, and Gearan has sought to address some of the student frustration. All the while, Caroline Kennedy remains absent from the committee her family has long steered.
Tensions over the Institute’s role at Harvard have long been present in the storied relationship between the school and the Kennedy family.
In a stunning 1968 letter that has never been previously reported, Jacqueline L. “Jackie” Kennedy Onassis — JFK’s widow and a founding member of the Senior Advisory Committee — expressed her frustration about Harvard’s stewardship of the memorials to her late husband.
“Memorials can never replace men — and one just argues to exhaustion with a lot of wooden people who will have it their way in the end anyway,” Kennedy wrote to Robert S. McNamara, JFK’s Defense Secretary.
The letter, which was written just over one month after Bobby Kennedy was killed, came amid a years-long struggle over the JFK Library, which was originally supposed to be housed at Harvard but was eventually built at Columbia Point in Dorchester, where it opened in 1979.
“What is happening is that it is on its way to becoming the deadest place in the world,” Jackie Kennedy wrote of the library, “and gradually the Institute, which was the vital part one wanted to reflect Jack, will be swallowed up by the School of Government — which just turns out a lot of dreary men who love to spend their lives trading position papers back and forth.”
She expressed frustration that in naming “their dismal School of Government after Jack,” which “for some strange reason Bobby thought so nice at the time,” Harvard leaders had “assured they’d always keep the Institute under their thumb.”
Over the years, the relationship between the family and the University has ebbed and flowed, but was mutually productive — in large part because of Ted Kennedy’s involvement and relationships with University leaders, Caroline Kennedy said in an interview with The Crimson Sunday.
But in the 12 years since his death, under the leadership of a new Harvard president and a new Kennedy School dean, the Senior Advisory Committee has come to play a diminished role in overseeing the IOP, according to documents that shed new light on the governance tensions at the Institute.
In his 2009 letter to Faust, Ted Kennedy asked that “oversight of the IOP budget, programs and staff” be vested in the Senior Advisory Committee. The Kennedy family representative on the committee, he wrote, should play a leading role in selecting the committee’s chair, as well as a consultative role in picking committee members and the Institute’s director.
Under the proposal Elmendorf presented to Caroline Kennedy last February, almost none of those tenets were upheld. Elmendorf’s proposed structure sought to bring the Senior Advisory Committee “in line with the University’s practices regarding advisory boards,” according to a copy obtained by The Crimson.
It stipulated that members “refrain from direct interactions” with most IOP staff members and not be “involved directly” with budget decisions. New committee members, the proposal said, would be “chosen by the IOP Director and the Harvard Kennedy School Dean in consultation with existing SAC members,” who would serve three-year terms “renewable by invitation of the Director and Dean.”
Concerned about the IOP’s governance and performance, Caroline Kennedy departed the committee shortly after receiving the plan.
“The ultimatum that Doug presented to me in February did not reflect the mission or history of the IOP as a non-academic center founded as a memorial to my father, in which three generations of our family has invested time, effort and devotion,” she wrote in her letter to Bacow later that year. “I hope that this element will not be eliminated in the current bureaucratic rationalization.”
In a statement on Sunday, Caroline Kennedy wrote that recent changes have failed to respect her family’s dedication to the Institute.
“﻿Through the depth of his commitment and the power of his personality and position, my Uncle Teddy was able to prevent my mother’s prophecy from coming true. I watched him advocate for the IOP with Harvard Presidents and Deans over many years,” Kennedy wrote. “Together, Harvard leaders and members of our family worked through the inevitable disagreements in a spirit of mutual respect, and the IOP flourished. It saddens me that I have been unable to protect its independent spirit and that my uncle’s own legacy is being devalued.”
Just over a month after Caroline Kennedy resigned, the committee’s remaining 14 members penned a letter to Bacow outlining their “deep concern” about the IOP’s future.
In the letter, which has not been previously reported, the Senior Advisory Committee members wrote that they were “deeply troubled by a new governance plan for the IOP that was recently presented to Ambassador Kennedy.”
“We believe it reflects a fundamental lack of understanding of the unique structure and operations, which have served Harvard and HKS so well,” they wrote.
Changes to the role granted to the committee in overseeing the IOP, they wrote, threaten “the vitality and future success” of the Institute. They asked to “resolve this matter relatively quickly and to have Ambassador Kennedy and the SAC return to helping lead this extraordinary institution.”
Previous “natural tensions” that arose between the Senior Advisory Committee and Harvard administrators “were always worked out in a spirit of mutual respect,” the committee wrote to Bacow. “We regret that this has been strained with changes in leadership in recent years.”
Frustrated that Caroline Kennedy was not quickly courted back, other Senior Advisory Committee members followed her out the door.
When Manny A. Diaz, the committee’s then-vice chair, resigned last May, he wrote to his colleagues that he was “disheartened by recent events, including and most notably Caroline’s departure and the failure to correct this unimaginable wrong,” according to a resignation email obtained by The Crimson.
With the departure of Diaz, who served as the mayor of Miami from 2001 to 2009 and now chairs the Florida Democratic Party, the committee was left leaderless. Its previous chair, Kenneth M. Duberstein, departed around the same time as Caroline Kennedy amid reported tensions with Elmendorf.
Despite the appointment of six new Senior Advisory Committee members in February, no new committee chair has been named. Former U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III is now the only Kennedy family member left on the committee, though he is not a direct descendant of JFK.
At a committee meeting last year, Joe Kennedy III questioned Elmendorf about the budget oversight role granted to the SAC, citing Elmendorf’s tenure as the director of the Congressional Budget Office as he asked for a more detailed accounting of the IOP’s finances, according to two sources in the meeting who were granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations.
Since the resignations, Elmendorf has submitted at least one revised governance proposal to committee members that attempted to address some of their concerns. In January, Elmendorf proposed a governance structure that carved out a specific role for Caroline Kennedy and more defined responsibility for the committee than the version offered to Kennedy in February 2020.
Granting the Senior Advisory Committee “a distinctive and crucial role in guiding the work of the IOP” is “crucial to ensuring the future success” of the Institute, Elmendorf wrote in a Jan. 5 letter obtained by The Crimson that included the revised governance plan.
“At the same time, the SAC’s role needs to be consistent with Harvard University’s practices regarding external advisory groups,” Elmendorf wrote. “Those practices encourage strong engagement by advisory groups but require that oversight and authority for the University’s activities rest with the University—consistent with the University’s intellectual independence, fiduciary responsibilities, charitable-gift terms, and need to provide clear lines of authority for staff and students. These guidelines have resulted in successful relationships across Harvard.”
The new governance proposal stipulated the Senior Advisory Committee chair will be “chosen by the HKS dean in consultation with the IOP Director and with Caroline Kennedy for the foreseeable future.” IOP directors will “be chosen by the HKS dean in consultation with” the committee and the president of the University, it said.
Soon after Elmendorf sent his revised structure, Richard L. Berke — the executive editor of STAT News — resigned from the committee, still citing concerns about the IOP’s governance.
He wrote in a resignation letter obtained by The Crimson that he “had planned to resign a year ago, but stayed on in the hopes that I could help sort out some of the issues over the governing structure of the IOP.”
“I am disheartened by the continued, protracted impasse,” Berke wrote. “I hope this can be resolved soon so that the students can get the full attention they deserve.”
In a statement to The Crimson last Friday, Elmendorf wrote that the Advisory Committee’s role “is consistent with Harvard-wide practices regarding external advisory groups.”
“These practices encourage strong engagement but, as with other such programs at Harvard, oversight rests with the University,” he wrote.
Some members of the Advisory Committee concur that limits on the committee’s authority are warranted. Philip R. Sharp, a former U.S. Representative from Indiana who has served on the board since 1998 and is a former IOP director, said in an interview that some members of the committee have pushed beyond the group’s intended role, to the point where “it was reasonable for the dean to be concerned.” He said, however, that he was not referring to Caroline Kennedy, who he hopes will return to the committee.
“There unquestionably have been occasions when members of the Advisory Committee thought we were more like a board of directors, to whom the management must answer and and take direction from,” Sharp said.
Others argue the governance stalemate is the product of a fundamental shift from historical precedent.
“Our request to you is fundamental, and we believe fair: to maintain the same relationship that has served Harvard, HKS and the IOP so well from the beginning,” the Advisory Committee — including Sharp — wrote to Bacow in the March 2020 letter. “To mandate the IOP and the SAC to adhere to the proposed strict governance rules that apply to other University institutes would put at risk the very reasons the IOP has succeeded.”
Elmendorf wrote in his statement Friday that the SAC “is crucial to helping the IOP focus on its core mission, and to helping enhance the message and mission of the IOP through their own experiences.”
“The senior advisory committee has been strengthened with the appointment of six new members this year who bring fresh voices and broad diversity in every sense,” Elmendorf wrote. “The committee is providing valuable counsel to the Institute’s leadership, staff, and students.”
The governance tensions arose amid concerns among some Senior Advisory Committee members about the Institute’s direction and management — namely, its staffing and budget.
Multiple IOP staff positions that were previously left unfilled have been eliminated in recent years, purportedly as part of a structural reorganization. The changes, several students and former staffers say, have left the IOP chronically short-staffed and created a culture of overwork.
In the fall of 2014, the IOP employed a total of 19 staff members, according to archives of its website, as well as an organizational chart from that year reviewed by The Crimson. Today, its staff page shows just 13 employees — including one who has been on leave and another who also works as the Washington Post’s chief correspondent.
In a statement Friday, Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote that there are just two current IOP vacancies, which are for staffers who departed in March.
“Some previous staff positions were absorbed into other roles and new positions were filled in recent years as the IOP has reorganized to meet changing demands,” Smith wrote.
According to numerous organizational charts reviewed by The Crimson, most IOP programs have typically been run by a director and a coordinator, with additional support from staff assistants at various points. But since 2017, following director-level staff vacancies, coordinators have often been left to run programs alone — without being promoted to the level of director. In some cases, staff assistants were brought in to assist the coordinators.
Two top posts — Director of Fellows and Study Groups and Director of Internships and Career Services — became vacant in 2017. The positions went unfilled until at least July 2019, according to IOP organizational charts that labeled the posts as “TBA.”
By 2020, the jobs had disappeared from the charts.
The Institute also lacked a JFK Jr. Forum Director between fall 2019 and August 2020. For that period, the forum was run by a coordinator and students, though an outside contractor helped direct it for a period.
In recent years, the IOP has also created and filled two new positions: Senior Fellow — a part-time post — and Director of Student Programs.
In a statement to The Crimson Friday, Gearan, the IOP Director, defended the organizational changes.
“The IOP has reorganized its structure in the past couple of years, combining some roles and creating others, as we have configured our team to meet fast-evolving challenges,” Gearan wrote. “These changes have enabled us to meet strategic shifts in programming.”
But the empty positions have fostered a culture of burnout, some students and former staff say.
“Everybody was exhausted,” said Amariah L. “Mari” Jones ’21, who served as IOP student president in 2020.
She also attributed the overwork to IOP executives having different priorities than students, requiring a constant student presence in meetings.
A 25-page institutional review compiled by two cohorts of IOP student leaders between fall 2019 and spring 2020 found student leaders frequently put in more than 20 hours of work per week at the IOP — a factor the report identified as limiting socioeconomic diversity in the organization. The reliance on student labor has prompted some to call for a compensation program.
“Until IOP Staff decides to recognize the student labor they depend on,” the report read, IOP student leaders will leave their roles with “a bitter taste in their mouth, which they undoubtedly share with other students who may at one point have been interested in becoming a member.”
The burnout and lack of recognition, the report suggested, will make alumni less likely to return to the IOP in the future.
“Our efforts to be responsive to students and to this momentous political time, especially during the pandemic, have given all of us lots to juggle, and we appreciate that people have gone the extra mile,” Gearan wrote. “We know we can always be better and we’re committed to working together to get there.”
Beyond its undergraduate programming, the IOP has not yet held or announced its Campaign Managers Conference following the 2020 election. The signature event, which is typically held in early December, has been hosted every four years since 1972, bringing top campaign officials together to reflect on the election year.
“Scheduling the campaign managers event has been complicated this year by the unprecedented issues around the 2020 election,” Smith wrote. “We are actively planning and developing this now, with a goal of holding the event by next month.”
Staff leaves-of-absence that have come on top of the restructuring created confusion about reporting and chain-of-command, according to Emily S. Brother ’19, who served as a staff assistant at the IOP from 2019 until earlier this month.
Brother, who was a student member of the IOP before joining its staff, publicly alleged in recent weeks that she was pushed out for raising concerns about gender-based harassment.
In a post on Medium, Brother alleged that in Feb. 16 and Feb. 17 meetings with Gearan and former IOP Executive Director Amy Howell, she raised concerns “about staff and student labor and employment practices, gender-based harassment, racial microaggressions, and financial accessibility.” Less than a month later, she said, she was offered a separation contract that included a waiver of her right to sue.
Days after receiving the contract, which she said she never signed, Brother was told she would be locked out of her email for alleged policy violations and given a termination date, according to a March 11 letter from Kennedy School Human Resources that she has posted publicly.
“Particularly with situations around gender-based harassment, I was trying my best to champion students who don’t have a voice when all of the power structures are bent set against them,” Brother said while asking a question at JFK Jr. Forum event hosted by the IOP on April 9.
“They need letters of recommendation, they need to graduate, and they can’t elevate their concerns and go too far — and push the status quo — without fear of retaliation,” Brother said of IOP student members. “At the end of the day, that is something that I feel that I’ve had to experience.”
On the day of her termination, Brother filed a complaint with the Harvard Title IX Office and the Office of Dispute Resolution alleging she was retaliated against for raising concerns about sexual harassment, she said. She also said she has entered a workplace problem-solving process through the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
Brother’s exit marked the third staff departure from the IOP in 2021. None have been replaced.
Smith declined to comment on Brother’s allegations due to a policy against speaking about individual personnel matters.
In recent years, Elmendorf has played a more active role in overseeing daily IOP operations and governance, according to several students and former staff.
“As long as there was kind of an understanding that we were allowed to do what we wanted to do, within reason, everything was well. And that lasted until Elmendorf came,” said Julie Schroeder, who worked as the executive assistant to IOP Directors between 2001 and 2018.
Multiple former IOP staff members, who were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive internal dynamics, said they believe Elmendorf has played an increased role in large part due to a lack of direction and leadership from Gearan.
Regardless, the dean’s influence over operations has sparked concerns among students that the Institute’s focus on undergraduates has diminished.
The institutional review conducted by students between 2019 and 2020 said undergraduates “have expressed feeling less included” in the IOP in recent semesters amid “an increased presence of graduate students and community members” around the Institute.
“I did feel like the IOP, throughout the time that I’ve been at the College, has been losing its autonomy,” said Jones, the former IOP student president.
“We couldn’t do anything without the Kennedy School’s approval of what we needed to do,” she added.
The institutional review called for a reduction in IOP programming, streamlined communication between students and staff, and an increased focus on diversity.
Caroline Kennedy conveyed similar concerns in her letter to Bacow last June.
“The students I have spoken with find that the programming is losing its relevance to undergraduate interests and concerns,” she wrote. “The Forum programming is dominated by graduate centers, speakers, and events. The moderators lack diversity, and the discussions are not thought-provoking.”
Students and former staff have also complained of a lack of transparency in decision-making from top IOP executives.
In 2019, IOP staff and student leaders took part in focus groups organized by the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning — the University’s teaching support center — centered around how to improve the Institute. But the Bok Center’s report never saw the light of day, despite an expectation among at least some IOP affiliates that their feedback would be released.
The process by which IOP fellows are ultimately selected also remains a mystery to students. Despite a student-led fellows search committee that interviews candidates and provides input, students are not in the room when final selections are made, according to Eric K. Jjemba ’21, who was the student chair of the Fellows and Study Groups Program in 2020.
Jjemba said he thinks the opaque process is “representative of a distrust” that the IOP has in “the students that fill its space.”
Gearan, a former Crimson News editor, wrote that during the pandemic, the Institute “has responded with robust virtual programming and innovations designed to meet this unique moment.”
“We’ve added internship opportunities for students, launched the Harvard Votes Challenge, recruited a dynamic group of fellows, expanded leadership opportunities for students including moderating the JFK Jr. Forum,” Gearan wrote. “The changes we have begun reflect the need to reach beyond the IOP’s focus solely on electoral politics and to equip students to engage in broader public service and activism.”
Despite wide-ranging concerns, Caroline Kennedy wrote in a statement to The Crimson on April 12 that she remains “hopeful that the substantive issues will be addressed.”
“No one would be happier than me to see the IOP leading the pack,” she wrote. “My family continues to care deeply about the IOP and has always worked to put its students first. If I can contribute to its success in the future, I would be happy to do so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sikhs and Companions of Harvard hosted a vigil Sunday night to honor the victims of the recent mass shooting at a FedEx warehouse in Indianapolis, in which four of the eight victims of the attack were Sikh.
Eighteen other organizations from both Harvard and Wellesley College cosponsored the vigil, and more than 90 people attended virtually.
Though the organizers acknowledged officials have yet to determine whether the attack was a hate crime, they said it was nonetheless important to honor the lives lost.
“We demand the police investigate the role of bias,” SACH member Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 said at the start of the vigil. “But meanwhile, we don't need a hate crime classification in order to grieve with the families, the Sikh community.”
"This space is for us to heal together and honor the lives lost,” she added.
The vigil included a live musical performance of kirtan, Sikh devotional music, as attendees entered the virtual space.
SACH member Raj K. S. Gambhir ’21 said the year has been “extraordinarily hard” for many minority groups, but said he hopes the event could act as a space for solidarity and healing for all affected groups.
“What happened on Thursday is connected to so many other forms of oppression in this country and in the world,” Gambhir said. “I hope that tonight can both be a space to grieve, for us to reflect, and for us to consider how we can best support people who may not look like us, may be from different backgrounds, but are ultimately experiencing many of the same things that we are experiencing.”
Following remarks from the organizers, Harpreet K. Neelam gave another kirtan performance and sang two shabads — which are sacred songs or verses in Sikhism.
“The shabad is ultimately about the many hardships one faces,” Neelam said. “That remaining loyal, connected, and in love with your beloved for that love and connection is what will get you through the difficult and challenging times.”
Vigil attendees held a moment of silence one minute to honor the lives lost this past Thursday. Ahuja also led an open discussion to allow attendees to share their thoughts, opinions and emotions.
During the event, SACH shared a fundraiser they are running to support four different organizations working to advance the “civil and political liberties’ of Sikh people in the United States.
Mukesh Prasad ’93, who attended the vigil, wrote in an email he found it “refreshing and inspiring” to see students of all different backgrounds and groups come together in support of the Sikh community. Prasad is vice president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, which co-sponsored the event.
“May we always remember we are stronger together and an attack on any one of us is an attack not only on all of us but also an attack on the diversity which constitutes our nation’s greatest strength,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 joined six Harvard students to discuss the importance of art in bridging various personal and global gaps in a virtual event on Monday as part of this year's virtual ARTS FIRST festival, hosted by Harvard’s Office of the Arts.
The event, titled “Music and Human Connection” and moderated by Alicia Anstead and Jack Megan of the OFA, is the first of three conversations with past Harvard Arts Medal recipients as part of ARTS FIRST, which runs from April 19 to April 30.
Ma spoke on the emotional demands of his art, including his struggle to embrace imperfections.
In response to Alan J. Tu ’23, who asked Ma about the role of messiness and experimentation in his music, Ma urged listeners to be “absolutely present” in every moment despite its flaws.
“The first thing that I had to get rid of in performing, which is about essentially being in an unstable environment that you can't control, is to get rid of the idea of perfection,” he said.
Anastasia A. Onyango ’22 asked about Ma’s examination of the relationship between pain and joy in his art, citing his recent performance at a vaccine clinic in the Boston area.
“I think everything about humanity exists in the space between life and death,” Ma said.
“Very often, I've played the very same music from my friends’ weddings, as well as their memorial services,” he added.
Victoria Sanchez ’21 inquired about bridging the gap between audience and performer.
“I can tell you from performing for over 50 years that the best way I have found to perform is to be in that semi-awake and sleep,” Ma said. “That's the time when you are maximally open between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind.”
Noah A. Harris ’22 said he has increasing skepticism in the government’s ability to inspire hope, especially among marginalized populations. He asked if there is a way for music to remedy that feeling.
In response, Ma shared an anecdote about his days as a young musician, recalling how his teachers told him that even though he played well, he did not know the first thing about music because he was only playing for himself.
“So, for the rest of my life, I'm trying to actually really understand and advocate for someone else's voice,” he said.
“Artistic visions were created with this profound realization,” Benjamin T. Rossen ‘24, an audience member, wrote after the event. “Mr. Ma’s insight emphasized this responsibility of unity, connection, and universality.”
Mafaz Al-Suwaidan, the only graduate student on the panel, read an interview from the Paris Review with James Baldwin, who spoke on the guidance that he received from a fellow painter. She asked Ma who guides him and helps him to see differently.
Ma said that one should “savor as much as possible a beginner’s mind.”
Ma ended the event with a short virtual performance, dedicating the performance to the “wonderful” students on the panel.
“The theme of the whole night was human connection, and music or human connection, art, I just felt very connected to my fellow panelists,” Onyango said after the event. “You could even feel the audience there.”
“Just the fact that like people stayed and lingered, because they wanted to hold on to that moment,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council reviewed new resolutions and reflected on challenges wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic during its final public meeting of the academic year on Monday.
Both the resolutions introduced at the meeting aim to ease the financial and mental burdens facing graduate students as a result of the pandemic.
One resolution, brought by Graduate School of Education student Said Bilani, among others, advocated for the use of the Council’s One Harvard Catalyst Fund to provide “financial support to students challenged by the circumstances of the Pandemic.”
The other resolution, organized by Rutvij Merchant, a student at the School of Public Health, presented a slew of recommendations including the extension of University emails for 2021 graduates for at least two years after graduation. The resolution, in response to the intersectional challenges graduate students have faced during the pandemic, posits that access to Harvard emails will assist recent graduates with the job search process.
The Council ultimately chose to table the vote on the passage of both resolutions.
Chair of Advocacy Abhinaya Narayanan — who met earlier on Monday with representatives of Harvard University Information Technology along with other members of HGC— said they will continue to advocate for the expansion of post-graduation University email access, a course of action that several peer institutions have already taken.
“It looks like there’s a promising sense that they will extend email access to 365 days for graduates for this year,” she said. “However, on the discussion of lifetime email access, they raised a lot of concerns.”
Though they faced pushback from HUIT on the recommendation of lifetime email access, Narayanan said the Council is “not closing the door” on the conversation. She cited at least one potential alternative: the creation of a five-year “buffer period” where job-hunting graduates would be afforded access to University emails.
As the meeting came to a close and representatives reflected on an atypical semester, outgoing Council President Chanthia C. Ma said she was excited for the body’s future work and new leadership.
“It’s been such an honor to serve this unprecedented term, where we started operations during the summer,” Ma said. “But now, we’re turning it over to an amazing team.”
Incoming Council Vice President Himaja Nagireddy, who was among the new executive board elected at the previous public meeting, also said she was grateful for members’ work over the past year.
“It is definitely a bittersweet moment because we’re saying goodbye to a lot of great people that we’ve had the privilege and the opportunity to work with this year,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the recommendation of an external review into Harvard’s police department, a newly formed committee comprised of affiliates spanning the University that will advise the department’s leadership held its inaugural meeting last month.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the department review in June 2020 on the heels of student outrage over the presence of HUPD officers monitoring a protest in Boston following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police.
The external review produced a more comprehensive probe into HUPD than an internal review set in motion in February 2020 in response to an investigation by The Crimson that found repeated instances of racism and sexism in the department and held the department’s leadership responsible for perpetuating a toxic culture among officers.
The external report, produced by the law enforcement consulting agency 21CP Solutions, recommended the University create an advisory board comprised of a “diverse group” of University stakeholders. The committee should serve as a “sounding board” to provide feedback to the department regarding policing on campus, per the report.
Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp said in a March 23 interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run magazine — that the purpose of the board is in part to “enhance communication and transparency between the department and our community.”
The Gazette article also listed the members of the advisory board, which is made up of 13 Harvard affiliates, including students, faculty and staff. They include Quincy House Faculty Dean and government professor Eric Beerbohm, Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Director of Diversity, Inclusivity and Belonging Tracie D. Jones, Kennedy School criminal justice professor Sandra Susan Smith, and two graduate students.
Harris said he was invited to serve on the board by the Dean of Students Office. As the only College student on the committee, Harris said he believes his primary role is to represent the student perspective.
“I feel like my presence on the board is pretty clear,” Harris said. “To make sure that everything that we do, everything that we put out, it’s something that students can engage with and it’s taking student perspectives into account.”
Director of Campus Services at Harvard Medical School Robert A. Dickson — another member of the Advisory Board — wrote in an email he believes it is important that members of the board actively listen to affiliates.
“As a member of the Advisory Board my goal is to listen to members of our community and provide relevant recommendations to HUPD leadership, with the ultimate goal of helping transform HUPD into a police department that every member of our diverse community can trust and can feel comfortable calling upon for service,” Dickson wrote.
The external review recommended the University engage in a “community-driven, stakeholder-involved process” to redefine public safety at Harvard. Among the factors to consider, the report includes exploring alternatives to police response for certain events, such as mental health interventions.
Tim Bowman, executive dean for administration and finance at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said he volunteered to join the board and believes exploring alternative responses to crises is one of the board’s top priorities.
“When might it make sense that HUPD is the first responder or is taking the lead on a particular issue? And when might it make sense for us to think as a university that, either in addition to or instead of a police officer, maybe it's someone else from the University that ends up getting dispatched to provide that help,” Bowman said. “Is it a mental health care provider? Is it someone from the residential life staff for a lock out?”
During its first meeting on March 26, Harris said the committee discussed exploring alternatives to HUPD. Per Harris, “a lot” of students believe an armed police officer should not be the first response to incidents including mental health crises, dorm room lock-outs, or substance-related emergencies. Harris suggested mental health professionals or representatives from the groups Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors and Peer Advising Fellows may be better suited to respond to such events.
“That may be more productive and that may create a community where we actually feel like we’re tailoring the situation with the person who we’re sending out,” Harris said.
According to a fall 2020 survey conducted by The Crimson, nearly one in three College students believe HUPD should be defunded or abolished.
Harris, though he said he has been critical of HUPD in the past, is “optimistic” that the advisory board will help to improve public safety at Harvard.
“As someone who has been critical of HUPD publicly through advocacy with the Undergraduate Council, I’m joining this space to try and bring some of that frustration that students have felt when a situation happens and they’re not able to have the access that they feel they need to HUPD to create change,” Harris said. “So that we’re not just waiting around for something else negative to happen.”
While the advisory board begins its work, the University is undergoing a search for a new chief — now in its ninth month — to replace interim chief Denis Downing, who assumed command from Francis D. “Bud” Riley. Riley helmed HUPD for 25 years before he retired at the end of 2020 amid controversy over his leadership.
Bowman said the board plans to work closely with the next chief, who he believes the University will announce “relatively soon.”
“The board expects to work very closely with the new chief as they come on board,” Bowman said. “We plan to help them get acclimated and understand what our expectations are as a community and how we can best serve them as they get oriented into this new role.”

With the confirmation of Martin J. "Marty" Walsh as labor secretary on March 22, President Joe Biden’s full slate of Cabinet secretaries have assumed office — and with five Harvard graduates, it has a decidedly crimson hue.
On Jan. 20, the day of Biden’s inauguration, The Crimson reported that the incoming administration had recruited 63 officials with Harvard ties, and that number has only grown. Recent estimates suggest that over a third of all Biden staffers are Ivy League graduates, a fact that may be surprising given that Biden flexed his blue-collar credentials during the campaign, including his education at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland ’74, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo ’93, Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84, and Transportation Secretary Peter P. M. “Pete” Buttigieg ’04 all walked Harvard’s halls as students. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen taught as an assistant professor of economics at Harvard from 1971 to 1976.
Various other cabinet-level officials, such as Chief of Staff Ronald A. “Ron” Klain, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia E. Rouse ’86, and U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai are Harvard graduates as well. Harvard Medical School professor Eric S. Lander is also awaiting confirmation as Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Andrew David, a history lecturer at Boston University, said in an interview that the abundance of Harvard graduates in the administration was likely not by design.
“Biden has been picking people that he feels comfortable with,” David said. “I think this is somewhat of an accident, that you have so many people with Harvard backgrounds. These are people that Biden has identified as coming from a similar background in terms of worldview.”
David said Blinken and Yellen were clear examples of this rule. Blinken served as Biden’s national security advisor during the first term of the Obama administration, while Yellen worked with Biden during her tenure as Chair of the Federal Reserve.
“Biden wants smart people around him, he wants people with experience, and he wants people that can get things done,” David said. “It just happens that these categories are all filled by people with Harvard resumes right now.”
While former President Barack Obama notably drew heavily on his network of associates from his time at Harvard Law, only two of his initial Cabinet members were fellow Harvard alumni — Education Secretary Arne S. Duncan ’86 and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun L. Donovan ’87. Obama’s presidency concluded, however, with seven Harvard-educated Cabinet members, the most of the past four presidencies.
Professor Roger B. Porter, a professor of business and government at the Kennedy School, wrote in an email that high Harvard representation in the Cabinet is not a novel phenomenon.
Porter — who served in the Ford, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush administrations — specifically pointed to the Cabinet of Gerald R. Ford, which included six secretaries who were either graduates or faculty of Harvard.
“When we discussed after he left office the composition of his cabinet President Ford said that he looked for the best talent he could attract and did not base his choices on where they studied,” Porter wrote. “Indeed, he seemed somewhat surprised, but pleased, when we reviewed how many of them had come from Harvard.”
“President Biden has leaned toward appointing people whom he knows from his nearly four and a half decades in public office, who have earned his confidence, and who have considerable government experience,” he added.
Marc K. Landy, a Boston College professor of political science, said while there is “sufficient diversity in the outlook” of Biden’s Cabinet, its abundant Harvard ties point to a significant issue in government.
“The deeper problem, and it’s probably not solvable, is that Cabinet appointees are going to come from elite organizations,” Landy said. “You think of them as Harvard people, but they’re also members of the most prestigious law firms and large corporations.”
“There is a race to the top that favors those with outstanding credentials,” he added.
Reflecting on his own experience in government, Porter argued by the time an official is at the point in their career when they are selected for the Cabinet, their undergraduate or graduate education is not relevant.
“During the three times I served in government the subject of where one attended school was not a frequent topic of conversation,” Porter wrote. “I considered my experience studying and teaching at Harvard an asset. At the same time, the focus was relentlessly on what skills you could contribute now not on where you earned your degrees.”

Do you ever wake up from your mid-lecture nap and suddenly have this moment where nothing feels real? Like, why are you watching your lecture online, from your childhood bedroom, with damp hair slightly scented like seasoning from when you passed out face down in your bowl of ramen?
Me too. It hits me especially hard when I’m watching Netflix (definitely not mid-lecture) and the characters are gathering in groups without masks. Today’s pandemic world feels like an alternate dimension, yet we keep hearing the term “new normal”. And, after taking a step back, you realize how much society has already adapted to this “new normal” without fully being aware of it. As proof, here are some common phrases we’ve started saying because of the pandemic that would have sounded crazy to us before ’rona moved in.
“So sorry, I swear it’s just my allergies! So sorry!”
Never before have people been so apologetic about their allergies. Or been so desperate to stifle sneezes. Or coughs. Or sniffles. Or anything that may sound like a cold, even if it’s not actually a symptom of the coronavirus. Some days, it’s just better to stay home and not buy those bananas you needed in order to make the fifth banana bread of this week.
“Please remain socially distant and six feet apart at all times.”
This may sound perfectly normal to us now, but think back to a year ago. How would you react if the lady at the grocery store told you to stay away from all other human beings in the vicinity? It would just be weird. That is all.
“Sorry, you can’t come inside without a mask.”
This one’s in the same category. Seems very reasonable now, but back in the pre-rona ages, this one would have sounded just bizarre. Is this some sort of coup? Are we all robbing the store together? Or are we performing surgery in the middle of the store? Is there some hazardous chemical on the walls that we shouldn’t be breathing in? Are masks the new fashion statement? A pandemic would probably be the last thing that comes to mind.
“Oh, sorry, I forgot to put my hand down.” 
Ah, yes, the beauty of Zoom classes. Think about it. You forgot to put your hand down? Obviously, in the Zoom context this phrase makes perfect sense, but if someone overheard you from another room before Zoom classes were a thing, they may or may not have taken you for a lunatic.
Constantly telling everyone to “stay safe”
Whether it’s when you’re catching up with an old friend or signing off powerfully worded emails to your professors, you keep telling people to “stay safe.” In normal times, we would have thought that was just strange. Like, how did you know I was about to send that risky text to my ex? Just food for thought.
“I’m getting such bad maskne.”
It’s a thing. Wearing masks and sweating in them for hours on end has been negatively affecting our complexions throughout the pandemic (it’s definitely not caused in part by all of the baked goods we’ve been consuming). But “maskne” is an entirely new slang word that didn’t exist before Coronavirus. A year or so ago, if someone overheard you saying that, they would have either been plain confused, or utterly disappointed in their inability to keep up with all the modern day lingo.
Elbow tap!
I’ll let you think about this one on your own.
Well, that’s all for now. Stay safe ;)
