Have you ever wondered why drinking in Massachusetts feels like it takes more effort than it should? If yes, you’re not alone — in 2013, Time Magazine even ranked Massachusetts as one of the worst states to drink in, second only to Utah.
By supporting ballot question three, bay staters can help remedy our state-wide alcohol supply issues — which is why we urge voters to vote yes on Ballot Question Three.
Understanding what's at stake with question three is understanding the complex nature of alcohol licensing in our state. Currently, Massachusetts permits small and large businesses alike to hold at most nine licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages, with the rationale of protecting small liquor “package” stores and, presumably, preventing our citizens from becoming too frequently intoxicated out of concern for public safety. Ballot Question Three would expand the maximum number from nine to 18, with the caveat that the increase will be gradual in character, with progressive increases over the course of the next decade.
At first glance, big corporations may seem poised to benefit the most from the measure: Large retailers tend to control more alcohol-selling locations and could take advantage of owning more licenses. Yet the changes included in question three, conceived as a compromise reform, could also help endearing package stores and support our local economies.
As of today, our state offers two kinds of licenses — one that allows for the sale of all liquor, and one that allows for the sale of beer and wine only. Businesses can own as many of either as they like, provided that they don’t exceed a total of nine. If Ballot Question Three were to pass, however, only seven of those licenses would be eligible for the “all liquor” status, with the rest required to be beer and wine only. The change would shift the balance of economic power towards local small businesses — packies — like C’est Bon in Harvard Square, which occupy a neighborhood niche and are not large chains.
Small local businesses writ large are essential to the social and economic fabric of their communities: They create local jobs, keep taxes close to home, and give back to the community in times of prosperity. Question three would support them by limiting large corporate market intrusions in one of their main sources of income.
Ballot Question Three also includes several other measures intended to protect packies and consumers alike. The amendment would ban the use of self-checkout systems for the purchase of alcohol, shift fine calculations for license misuse so that they are based on total retail profits rather than just liquor sales, and increase the number of legally acceptable IDs when purchasing alcohol to include out-of-state drivers’ licenses.
These measures, if passed, may also significantly improve nightlife for college students. As we have previously opined, attempts to aggressively and unrealistically limit access to alcohol — such as the current federal legal drinking age — often fail to achieve their intended effect of making alcohol consumption safer. When denied legal and supervised access to alcohol, young adults like ourselves or our peers are likely to resort to binge drinking in unsupervised environments, out of the eye of those who could help in the event of alcohol poisoning. Massachusetts, especially Cambridge and Boston given their particularly large populations of college students, should have a vibrant nightlife. For college students who are otherwise bombarded with academic and external responsibilities, a vibrant and safe nightlife can provide much-needed relief and promote wellness — which, in our opinion, should not be policed.
Expanding liquor licenses to more stores and permitting out-of-state IDs as a form of legal identification will improve college students’ legal access to alcohol, removing barriers against safe consumption while protecting local suppliers. In doing so, these intermediary measures  can help ensure a safer, more fun college experience — not just at Harvard, but at every college across Massachusetts.
If passed, Ballot Question Three could be a win for packies over big corporations (albeit one born out of compromise!) and those in favor of a more safe and more fun nightlife involving responsible alcohol consumption. Our state can do better than second-to-Utah; our local stores deserve protection and our consumers deserve the ability to buy low-grade alcohol at more locations. For those reasons, we urge voters to vote yes on Ballot Question Three.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This staff editorial is part of The Crimson Editorial Board’s 2022 Massachusetts Election Guide. See the full guide here.
This election season, Massachusetts voters will be asked to let undocumented immigrants apply for the privilege of being able to drive. Every practical and ethical consideration points in the same direction: Vote yes on Ballot Question Four.
In contemporary America’s age of the freeway, driving is a necessity. Massachusetts workers have the fourth-longest commute among U.S. states and have only seen that time increase in recent years. As Boston housing prices skyrocket, people are often forced to move out of the city and travel even further to work each day. Meanwhile, Massachusetts’ undocumented population increased by 60,000 from 2007 to 2017 — more than any other state. If these new arrivals are legally prohibited from driving to jobs they need to survive, we suspect the most likely long-term outcome will be a large population driving unlicensed out of necessity. This is unsafe and impractical.
It is also unfair. Contrary to popular belief, undocumented immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes every year — taxes that help to fund infrastructure, including the roads that they are too often barred from legally using. Rigid and ill-advised restrictions on who can hold driver’s licenses result in an unsafe and unfair Massachusetts.
Ironic, then, that the loudest opposition to Ballot Question Four comes from groups like the self-styled “Fair and Secure Massachusetts.” The group’s name, messaging, and substantive arguments recall a brand of xenophobic alarmism that views undocumented immigrants as inherently dangerous.
The group warns of “everything that comes with illegal immigration” before rattling off a laundry list of violent crime and drug concerns. When the available evidence points toward substantially lower crime rates among undocumented immigrants as compared to native-born Americans, the only possible explanations for such statements are ignorance or xenophobia.
Similarly, Fair and Secure Massachusetts slams question four for decreasing election security even though simply presenting a driver’s license is insufficient for voting in the state of Massachusetts. A more reasoned judgment would have recognized that fear-mongering over low-income people of color subverting election integrity is broadly unwarranted; when America has faced issues of election integrity, some of the worst culprits have come from disproportionately gilded backgrounds.
Finally, we arrive at the least substantive argument of question four’s opponents: That any policy that makes life better for undocumented immigrants implicitly rewards and encourages illegal immigration. Of course, this logic has no limit. It readily justifies any policy which hurts undocumented immigrants, and in fact, better justifies the cruelest.
The arguments against question four too often rely on a willingness to treat immigrants instrumentally — as tools of immigration policy rather than as dignified human beings. It is one thing to make directly restrictionist immigration policies. It is quite another to do so indirectly by denying innocent people basic rights and freedoms. We oppose both approaches, but hold particular contempt for the latter. The same attitude which justifies family separations and deceptive stunts at the border has reared its head in the debate over question four.
Living in the United States as a non-citizen — regardless of immigration status — imposes a vast menu of restrictions that question four would only slightly liberalize. Without ownership of one of the most powerful passports in the world, non-naturalized immigrants are barred from many of the privileges that Americans enjoy. Non-citizens cannot be granted security clearance, limiting their eligibility for important public and private sector roles. There are greater barriers to non-citizens serving in the military, despite a military recruiting crisis that continues to grow as the pool of eligible citizens dries up. “Non-qualified” immigrants — including undocumented immigrants — generally cannot receive food stamps, sign up for Medicaid, or enjoy most other federal public benefit programs. Contrary to the narrative propagated by Fair and Safe Massachusetts, granting undocumented immigrants the legal right to drive constitutes a small, measured, and exceedingly practical improvement to this patchwork of restrictions.
We cannot give in to fear unfounded in fact. On question four, that means voting yes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today on social media, girls flaunt perfect lives: styled hair, trendy and fashionable outfits, picturesque backgrounds, flattering but casual poses. The snapshots curate a particular image of effortless beauty, but behind the scenes, even the most casual selfies take tens of tries and a full face of makeup. Posed photos are the result of a million pieces falling into place, making one photo the one that outdoes the others: the background, the pose, the outfit, the hair are each good enough. Aesthetic shots of cities and landscapes are carefully chosen to match a color scheme and curate the feed.
These posting rituals speak of long-held beauty standards, modeled by popular accounts and cascading down to the normal person and 16-year-old girl. If you’ve been wondering “why is everyone famous on social media so thin/attractive/white?”, you’re not alone. It’s widely speculated that the TikTok “For You” algorithm scores users by euro-centric standards of attractiveness, and Black influencers find it significantly harder than their white counterparts to secure brand deals and make income. The fact is algorithms boost well-performing content, absorbing an entire human history of white and thin people imposing standards on everyone else.
While beauty standards aren’t new, one might argue that social media promotes them in an especially harmful way. Research isn’t yet conclusive on how social media’s unique interactivity affects perceptions of beauty. Social media does contribute to negative body image; however, exposure to traditional media has a similar effect. Meanwhile, the nature of influential content is shifting from aspirational to relatable, as increasingly digestible media forms connect with audiences in more casual ways. Marketers know this, so marketing has moved from traditional advertisements towards influencer sponsorships. For example, Doja Cat made a Tiktok jingle about Mexican pizza for Taco Bell, and Duolingo is known for its “unhinged” social media persona.
The shift is noticeable. Gone are the aspirational bloggers of 2014, posting DSLR photography and expensive foreign destinations — my current feed is girls about my age, who look like me, holding photoshoots on city streets and parking garages. Instead of VS Pink models, my “celebrities” are influencers like Helen Peng, a girl who could basically be my classmate, except that she’s an incredible dancer with 1.8 million Tiktok followers.
Embedded in the rules accompanying this shift is a gendered expectation, always the message to girls: Try, but don’t try too hard. Look polished but relatable, model but not unnaturally, wear natural makeup but not full glam. Blur your photos so they look taken in the moment.
Instead of aspirational lives that only rich celebrities who evidently have very different circumstances can attain, we constantly view “relatable” content from people just slightly ahead of us. Productivity YouTubers are just like you, but they have a perfect system for studying and note-taking. Fashion bloggers tell you exactly which clothes they bought, so you can buy them and achieve the same look. The standards are subtle but demanding, asking why we can’t do it if they can.
In many ways, the beauty standards of relatability are more far-reaching than before. Instead of being limited to the sphere of physical appearance, an entire lifestyle is idealized and projected. In every aspect of life, there’s relatable content for you to aspire to: diet, outfits, travel, workouts, work, home decor, nights out, nights in, friend groups, even crying. So we strive, because we believe we can recreate these idealized scenes. They make it look easy.
What makes the standards more insidious is that they’re never spoken, only understood by a sea of girls finding their place in the digital age. Influencers often don’t take the stance of a brand selling you a product; they approach their audience as a friend giving an honest recommendation. It doesn’t feel like conforming to a beauty standard when an online persona you trust recommended you a new study system, or a different brand of hair product.
Young girls — the generation we say look like 23-year-olds when they’re only 16 — grew up looking at perfect pictures of others online, and they understand what the digital world asks of them, learning social rules analogous to the ones they pick up in school. Naturally, they learn. They don new haircuts, draw on freckles and eyebrows, learn to pose in photos (perhaps by watching a modeling tips video), get outfit inspiration from 25-year-old bloggers, and wear blazers to school. They become photographers and social media managers. It’s second nature because these are the rules of digital society.
This is the world my little sister will grow up in. Still, I won’t tell her to delete social media and recover some past innocence from before digital standards permeated our consciousness. These are the new rules, and if any girl enjoys engaging with lifestyles portrayed on social media, she deserves to try as hard as she wants without contempt. (No one is telling boys to stop hitting the gym every day in their pursuit of an ideal body type.) Obviously, take care of yourself first, and take whatever measures you need against social media’s many physical and mental negative effects. When your health is spoken for, then curate your Instagram feed if you want, go out with your friends and have a day-long photoshoot if you want.
The act of revolution is not necessarily ignoring standards entirely, rejecting the supposedly frivolous pursuit of beauty in the name of feminism. I think it’s finding a way to love yourself anyway — whether it involves makeup or fashion or fitness, or posting on Instagram, or not posting on Instagram. It’s coming to terms with who you are, both your physical and digital selves.

Sheila S. Jasanoff ‘64 is the Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies at the Harvard Kennedy School. Prior to establishing and directing Harvard’s STS Program, she served as the founding chair of the STS Department at Cornell University. She recently received the 2022 Holberg Prize — an award akin to the Nobel Prize for the humanities and social sciences — for her contributions to the STS field.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Could you tell me the story of how you came to STS? I’m curious about how your eclectic academic and professional occupations shaped your decision to enter the field or have shaped your thinking within it.
SSJ: I think “decision” is the wrong word. Many things were accidental. I started off on a science/math track because that was the preferred track for first generation or immigrant families. I was sent to Germany to study chemistry after I graduated. And there I met the person who eventually became my husband. From him, I learned that there was a field called linguistics. I ended up switching fields and later came back to Harvard and got a doctorate in linguistics. Then we confronted the frequent problem of two career professionals in the same field. I ended up going to law school, mostly as a practical choice. I had never thought that I would end up being a professor, let alone in the field that I'm in. But then, again due to career pressure, we moved to upstate New York, as my husband got a tenured position at Cornell, and the town was way too small to support anything so specialized as environmental legal practice. That's when I got into STS. STS wasn't yet a thing, really. There was a program called Science, Technology, and Society that had been founded because people felt that science and technology had such profound impacts on society that people should be studying, but there wasn't a field. There was no way of hiring faculty members into STS, and there was not even any idea of what a disciplined study of science and technology might look like. That's where my ultimate discovery process began.
FM: What does it actually take to establish a dedicated track for STS, as you have at HKS?
SSJ: During my time at Cornell, I was too busy to step back and think about the answer to this question. I spent 10 years establishing my own career in this field that in a sense didn't yet exist. For my second 10 years at Cornell, I acquired more of an administrative position, first by becoming director of the STS program and then in 1991, becoming the Founding Chair of a new department. We were very busy, my colleagues and I, crafting the curriculum, thinking hard about what it was that we were preparing students to do. When I came to Harvard in 1998, that was the first time I could look backward and think, “Well, what is the driving reason to have STS represented in academia?”
I’d say STS stands in relation to the practices of science and technology in the same way that many humanities and social science fields stand in relation to other areas of human creativity. We have English because people write, and we have Film and Media Studies because people make artistic things. Science and technology are such central activities of human society, yet we don’t have a dedicated field that reflects [on this process]. We spend more time thinking “Who are we as political beings?” than “Who are we as knowledge-making beings, as experimental beings?” Once you start thinking like this, STS falls into place almost like the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle. The question then becomes, “Why doesn’t everyone have STS?”
FM: What is your current assessment of the field as it stands, either as viewed at Harvard or more broadly? And where would you like it to go?
SSJ: The place that STS is located in universities has tended to be very varied, partly because there isn't a universal recognition that we should have STS. It’s been a bit haphazard. If you teach STS at an engineering school, you may be emphasizing technologies that have impact, that carry risks. For me, doing STS at a policy school was continuous with things that I had already been thinking about as a lawyer. I’ve always been interested in regulation, governance, and the ways in which power is exercised vis à vis knowledge. The field as a whole should be addressing all of these things.
FM: Many prominent STS scholars buy into the idea of the social construction of scientific facts. Do you believe we can ascertain anything in an “objective” fashion? If not, how can we avoid falling into the dizzying or dangerous relativism of “Well, nothing is real, then”? 
SSJ: Social construction can imply that any opinion is as good as any other or that there is no background reality. I think that social construction has to be understood in a different way: people like me are simply interested in how certain things came to be the way they are. There's hardly anything that you can look out at in the world and say, “it had to be that way.” Did we have to have telescopes? Did we have to have the Hubble? Did we have to have Elon Musk [attempt to send] rockets to Mars? Obviously not. These are products of human choice. One can then ask why it is that we construct these realities and not others. The project is not at all about the denial of reality; it actually puts reality right in the center of the gaze. Social construction simply makes us more attentive to the idea that we human beings, as social beings, take the world and parse it in different ways. We look at the kaleidoscope of the world and turn it so that some things pattern one way or another. Things are real, but they're real because there is an infrastructure that supports those characterizations of reality as the ones that matter to people.
FM: There’s a popular idea that science has newly been politicized, but your work emphasizes that science is inherently political. Once you realize this, what are you meant to do with it? 
SSJ: One has to take apart the two halves of that question. Political scientists sometimes talk about Politics with a big P, which refers to formal institutions like political parties and what those organs do. They also talk about small politics, which refer to choices that are not made through the official political process but which can still be political. For instance, suppose a citizen boycott takes a product off the market, or drives a company to adopt standards that it didn't think it would adopt. In that sense, science has political dimensions that have to do with orderings of power. If you look at the structure within the lab, as many STS scholars have, you can see that there may be a politics involved in terms of who gets the bench near the window and who gets the corner office. There are questions of hierarchy, of relative wealth or poverty inside of any social organization. These are dimensions of the political in science that I think many scientists themselves recognize and want to do something about. The question about the relationship between science and policy is a bit different.
FM: What sort of relationship should scientists have with policymakers?
SSJ: One of my first books was called The Fifth Branch, and it was subtitled “science advisors as policy makers.” I was trying to point out that it's not science and policy; it’s science as policy to some extent. Society acknowledges a number of things at the same time. It acknowledges that we do need expert knowledge, that somebody ought to have some information about what we're trying to do. It also recognizes that there are profound uncertainties, and that there may be big disagreements over what cause-effect relations you should be studying and about the design of the study, especially in frontier studies. In contested territory, acting as if scientists can come in and offer truthful advice is a little naive. One has to recognize that scientists themselves make judgment calls about what the best way is of studying certain phenomena. The place of STS is to get into the guts of these relationships and think hard about when it is that expertise is overstepping its bounds. When is it that the wrong kind of expertise is being called to the table? When is it that citizens through knowledge of their own experience have a kind of expertise that should be brought to the decision-making table?
FM: Can you give an example of what you mean when you say there are limits to what scientists can offer? 
SSJ: The assumption in science policy has been for a long time that science and technology chart the way and decision-making follows. Yet talking to people in situ often produces a different picture of what the problem is and how it should be solved. It's absolutely certain that scientific advances will show us new things, and those things may meet people's needs. For instance, it may indeed be possible to do yet more with agriculture so that we have crops and plants ready at hand that could meet very severe drought conditions. But at the same time, if we take a community and say, “Why are you living in a food desert?” or “Where are your hunger needs likely to come from?” you’ll end up with a different trajectory from the one that begins with the bench and says, “How can I make this discovery more palatable to the world?”
FM: What do you believe are the chief obstacles to efforts to attend to the needs of the public? How hopeful are you that such change is possible?
SSJ: Scientists tend to regard the public as epistemically challenged: they make the assumption that if people knew enough, then they would behave in a more “reasonable” way. The question of whether it’s an optimistic future for science and society begins with how well each side understands the other. Are they imposing characterizations that are not really well fitted to the actual status of the polity? Today we live in political systems where even in many parts of the developing world, there are highly expert citizens. This kind of expertise is not ivory tower anymore. It's widely held by people in the ordinary polity. People have measurement instruments and devices, as well as mechanisms for testing. This has led to a potential for optimism — we have much more knowledge at our fingertips — and also a potential for doubt. If I can go find this out myself, why should I trust this other institution that tells me things? In the vaccine domain, for instance, you see that a lot of people are educated enough to see that there are holes in the evidence they are being presented, and they become skeptical. What to do about this is to work on the politics, [to help] people come to a position where their values are sufficiently aligned that they won't fight over the facts anymore. A way forward is to recognize that disputes of facts are often really disputes over the credibility, the honesty, and the integrity of the body finding the facts. If you could build that faith in integrity, then people would accept the facts as well.
FM: Which technologies, either existing or in development, do you believe pose the largest existential risks to humanity at the moment?
SSJ: I generally avoid questions that ask me to predict the future. The automobile has turned out to be one of the big contributors to existential risk. Of course, people were [initially] more worried about traffic accidents than about carbon in the oceans, though carbon emissions have turned out to be a bigger threat. I’d say technologies that have little room for reflection and get generalized, that impart a one-size-fits-all framing on the world, pose greater risks than technologies that are relatively more adapted and hence, not likely to be transported to a scale where it's suddenly going to harm a lot of people. On the whole, we should be scrutinizing technologies that morph without control, like machine learning; technologies that are extremely small and pervasive, like nanoparticles; technologies that are difficult to roll back, like biological experiments that may cross a line of dangerousness; and technologies that impinge on human values.
FM: How can STS help us think about responsible design practices for technologies that bear some amount of risk?
SSJ: A lot of STS scholars would say that we've been doing this already under the heading of what’s called RRI: responsible research and innovation. If you ask people what they mean by that, they will often say [you should] engage with a wider diversity of people earlier in the design process. This has serious applications where the user communities are well-defined and people already agree on what the aims are — say, the restoration of the body after an accident. But there are other technological pathways where the purposes are not necessarily known in advance. There, what you need is not involvement in the design process — that's already too far downstream—, but rather deliberative mechanisms to think harder about what purposes people might consider reasonable.
Genome editing, a topic my program is doing some work on, is one of these technologies. It has the potential to alter the human gene pool, to affect who we are as human beings. How is that being debated? Our contention is that the deliberative mechanisms we've developed are very narrow. They take genome editing as a given, as an inevitability. Therefore, let’s just debate how to guard people against the risks. I think that that's a narrowing of the vision. Recently, I heard a scientist talk about how we can already engineer people to need much less sleep. But nobody who's tinkering with the genes is thinking about what it means for society to become sleepless. Do we know what rest is good for? What does a society that has no room for reflection look like? And besides, in whose imagination is this an okay way to go? Maybe people who are interested in extracting more labor out of everybody.
FM: What have you found most helpful in facilitating conversations like these with scientists and engineers?
SSJ: I don't really think scientists need to be led to the table. Scientists are extremely aware that they live in a society where they have responsibilities. What they're often looking for is either a language in which to talk about the things that they notice — like the language of responsibility, of RRI — or company. If you're in an individual lab, you may be the only person who's thinking hard about societal impacts. It may be that your lab chief who would like to engineer you with the sleepless gene doesn't actually want you to be spending your time thinking about societal issues and thinks this is a waste of time. But if you took every lab together, you might find a big cohort of people who are actually thinking about these things. I have found it much easier actually to talk to scientists and engineers about STS. It's in some ways harder to persuade my social science colleagues that STS has anything new to offer.
FM: What is your proudest accomplishment as a parent?
SSJ: Having raised two children that are eminently successful but also good, caring people.
FM: Congratulations on the Holberg Prize! How did you feel receiving it? 
SSJ: We all know how the Nobel Prize announcement comes typically in the middle of the night or in the morning in a call from Scandinavia. I never thought in a million years that I would be the recipient of such a morning phone call from a country in Scandinavia. It was pretty shocking, in a good way, to be told, “You’re this year’s Holberg Laureate.” I didn’t know of the prize. It’s not the sort of thing one imagines coming out of the blue in a phone call.
FM: How do you plan on spending or allocating the prize money?
SSJ: I have my own plans for institutionalizing STS work for young scholars in another organization I’ve built: the Science and Democracy Network. My hope is that I can put the Network on a footing where it will not just hold annual meetings, but also have some resources with which to foster work, especially from countries that don't currently have the resources to send people to meetings.
FM: Out of the many places you’ve lived, across over a dozen countries, which is your favorite?
SSJ: Cambridge, Mass.

The Harvard Alumni Association will not deactivate alumni email forwarding sources, the organization announced Thursday in a change of heart that comes after thousands of alums signed petitions in protest.
After the HAA told alums in September they would deactivate their @post.harvard.edu and @alumni.harvard.edu email addresses, thousands of Harvard alums signed Change.org petitions decrying the move. The HAA cited security, spam filtering, and functionality considerations behind the original decision.
HAA Executive Director Philip W. Lovejoy wrote to alums Thursday morning that the organization would not go forward with the deactivations.
“In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to thoughtful feedback from many alumni and volunteers about our plan and have decided not to move forward with the discontinuation of Harvard’s alumni email forwarding service,” Lovejoy wrote.
David L. Huang ’97, who created a petition that received more than 2,800 signatures, described the reversal as a “relief” but only a “partial victory.”
“We need them to move to email accounts and also to give it to all alumni, not just prior alumni who already had it,” Huang said.

Email forwarding services, first provided to alumni in the 1990s, act as an alias where emails can be received, but they do not offer full inbox functionality. Beginning with the Class of 2021, the HAA stopped offering email forwarding addresses to new Harvard graduates.
Harvard spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the possibility of offering full email inboxes or forwarding addresses to recent graduates.
Lovejoy cautioned alums about functionality issues associated with alumni email forwarding and wrote that the HAA will “review alternative ways” to address these problems.
“I want to emphasize that email forwarding, in its current form, still poses a series of challenges, many of which the Harvard help desk cannot solve,” Lovejoy wrote. “I encourage you to think carefully about where and how you use your forwarding address and remind you to review the terms of use policies.”
Sally J. Wolf ’97, who worked with Huang to protest the deactivation, said she was “pleasantly surprised” the University quickly changed course. Still, she acknowledged functionality issues associated with the forwarding services and said further change is needed.
“They were reneging on a promise that they made with words like ‘lifelong’ and ‘permanence,’” Wolf said. “I am hopeful that going forward, that we can all collaborate — that we, the alum, some representation of alumni voices, can collaborate with the HAA and the school to co-create a solution that is ideal and also one that feels fully inclusive.”
Petition co-creator Chris J. Nicholson ’97 called the original decision to deactivate an “unfortunate misunderstanding.”
“It’s to [the HAA’s] credit that they recognized that this was an error and moved kind of quickly to reassure alumni that it will be fixed,” Nicholson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview last week that while Harvard’s undergraduate advising system has its strengths, there is room for improved consistency and continuity in the advising experience.
Harvard undergraduates have a series of advisers throughout their four years. In their freshman year, they receive a residential adviser called a proctor, who may also serve as an academic adviser. Sophomores are assigned an interim adviser, and later, a concentration adviser who advises them until graduation.
The Crimson reported last month that some students felt a lack of support from their advisers, particularly during their freshman year.
Advising is an “important idea,” Khurana said, but its priorities for different students should be “better explored.”
“We are trying to address the unevenness of our advising system. We recognize that it has areas of strength, but it doesn’t work for all students,” he said. “We’ve already started thinking about how we strengthen the training and ensure more consistency in that training.”
Khurana pointed to concentration advising as a strength of the system and lauded the Advising Programs Office for making “significant strides” in its peer advising. Freshmen are assigned a Peer Advising Fellow — an upperclassman at the College — in addition to their academic and residential advisers.
The advising system should be “robust” to help undergraduates navigate both the academic and social contexts of Harvard, Khurana added.
“We realize that this is a multi-layered set of areas that we need to work on, and there is already a great deal of thinking going on about how to do it,” he said.
Khurana also discussed the following topics:
Dean of Students Search
During the interview, Khurana discussed the ongoing search process for the next Dean of Students.
“We’re trying to get a diverse pool of people with different backgrounds, educational institutions that they’ve been working at, and encouraging them to apply,” he said. “We have received some — a lot of — very outstanding applications.”
“There’s a search committee that will then take those applications and reduce them down to a smaller number of candidates who will then interview here on campus,” he added.
Khurana praised the work of former Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who left the position after being named University Marshal in August.
“It’s been absolute joy and pleasure to work with Katie these last few years,” Khurana said. “She has built a really strong Dean of Students Office, and I’m excited for what she’s going to do at the Marshal’s office.”
Israel Trek Boycott
For the third time since 2019, the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee launched a campaign calling for undergraduates to boycott the Harvard College Israel Trek, an annual subsidized spring break trip to Israel and the West Bank.
When asked about activism and dissent among campus groups, Khurana said the College encourages students to “raise issues” while “keeping an open mind.”
“We want students to raise issues, others to inform themselves about issues, and then also have the ability to understand different perspectives,” Khurana said. “It’s really important to humanize every single person, wherever we might stand on an issue.”

In Wake of Schrag Bullying Allegations, Harvard ESE and EPS Affiliates Call to Strengthen Anti-Bullying Policy
Harvard Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton will step down at the end of the 2022-23 academic year, he announced Thursday.
Hempton, who will continue teaching, joined HDS as a professor in 2007 and became the dean of the faculty in 2012. During his tenure, Hempton broadened the school’s multireligious educational offerings and diversified the faculty and student body.
In his resignation announcement to HDS affiliates Thursday, Hempton wrote that he was leaving the role with “so many happy memories.”
“I am grateful to all of you for your trust and support through some difficult times in the history of our country and the wider world,” Hempton wrote. “Nothing brings greater pleasure than knowing that we have all used our gifts and talents to help one another make a difference in the world.”
Hempton appointed more than one-third of the current Faculty of Divinity, including professors who promoted studies in African and African American religion, Islamic studies, and early Christianity and its connection to Judaism. He also supported the Women’s Studies in Religion program and the Center for the Study of World Religions at HDS.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow described Hempton as “inviting and open” and “dynamic and engaging” in a Thursday email to HDS affiliates.
“With inspiring conviction, he has expanded and elevated ambitions and perspectives, ever faithful to the ideal of a just world, a world at peace,” Bacow wrote.
During his deanship, Hampton oversaw the renovation and 2021 reopening of Swartz Hall, a central campus building formerly known as Andover Hall. In addition to the main building’s renewal, its storied chapel was renamed after Preston N. Williams, the first tenured African American member of the HDS faculty.
Originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland, Hempton was a first-generation college student at the Queen’s University of Belfast, where he developed his interest in religious studies. He would later write his Ph.D. dissertation on religion and political culture at the University of St. Andrews.
Hampton’s scholarship focuses on topics including religious identities and ethnic conflicts, the global history of Christianity since 1500, and religious disenchantment and secularization.
Hempton wrote in his announcement that he is planning to spend more time with his family and transition back to teaching and research roles.
“Great to be on this journey with you, even as this transition brings sadness as well as joy,” Hempton wrote. “Ever onwards!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jay O. Light, who served as dean of the Harvard Business School from 2005 to 2010, died of cancer earlier this month at his home in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts. He was 81.
Light, who earned his undergraduate degree from Cornell University and his doctorate at Harvard, served on the HBS faculty for 40 years between 1970-2010.
Light was the first HBS faculty member to receive the school’s Excellence in Teaching Award, which he received for his work in the first-year MBA program.
Light’s former students remember his wisdom and commitment to teaching, which they say allowed them to foster meaningful connections with him.
“Jay was extremely smart, self-deprecating, had great judgment and an impish sense of humor,” wrote Stephen A. Schwarzman, the founder and CEO of the Blackstone Group, who met Light in 1970 as a first-year at HBS. “He was a marvelous teacher who impacted many thousands of students over his career.”
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers appointed Light the dean of HBS in 2006, after he served as acting dean following the departure of Kim B. Clark the year prior. During his deanship, Light expanded HBS’s international footprint by helping to spearhead the Harvard Center Shanghai and took steps to bolster the school’s financial stability during the Great Recession.
“His wisdom, judgment, and ability to foresee and manage risk were invaluable to our school and our university during the financial crisis,” Joshua D. Coval, whose professorship is named after Light, wrote in an email.
Colleagues lauded his reliability and commitment to the University.
“Those who worked for him, with him and those he worked for could always count on [Light],” Summers wrote in a statement. “Jay taught me about the values HBS embodies, about the management of university endowments and most important through his example about how to stand up for excellence and foster community at the same time.”
“His optimism, deep empathy, and unique sense of humor made him a treasured colleague, mentor, and friend, ” Coval wrote.
Light is survived by his wife, Judy, and two children, Anne and James.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Education officials and sustainability experts discussed how students and educators can “engage creatively and intelligently” on climate change at a Harvard Graduate School of Education conference Thursday.
In a series of three panels, speakers at the event focused on how to shape curricula, collaborate between universities and school districts, and create a sense of urgency in addressing the climate crisis.
Three HGSE affiliates — professor Fernando M. Reimers, education researcher Tina Grotzer, and lecturer Laura A. Schifter — discussed how to include students in the effort to combat climate change during the event’s first panel.
Reimers said that Harvard needs to “partner with other institutions” including peer universities, K-12 schools, and other educational bodies to effectively address climate change.
“We are too small to actually make a dent on this issue unless we reach to the rest of society,” he said.
Grotzer said while individual educators can make a difference by introducing their students to climate data, changes to curricula are necessary to familiarize them with climate research done at institutions like Harvard.
“Teachers know their students,” Grotzer said. “They know their local environments. It is really the curriculum efforts that take those forms of expertise and put them in conversation with what we know from the research.”
Schifter said education on climate change needs to begin in high school, referencing polling that indicated few teenagers learn about solutions to climate change in the classroom. She added that all students should learn how to address “the greatest challenge of our time.”
The second panel featured three administrators from school districts across the country — representing Dallas, Denver, and Baltimore— who stressed the consequences of failing to address climate change with sufficient speed.
Ben Mackey, a Dallas school board trustee, said without a safe world to look forward to, the students’ educations will become irrelevant.
“We can have the best education system in the world, but if we don’t actually take care of the world, they’re not going to be able to do anything with that,” Mackey said. “We cannot abdicate our responsibility as school systems in this process.”
LeeAnn Kittle, director of sustainability for Denver Public Schools in Colorado, said her district hired grant writers to apply for federal grants funding sustainability efforts, among other initiatives.
Monica Goldson, CEO of Prince George’s County Public Schools in Maryland, said the push for action comes from both the students and the rapid turnover that occurs within school administrations.
“The sense of urgency does come from our students, but for them, it’s because they see their time in the school district as short, and they want to see change now.” Goldson said.
“I always have a sense of urgency,” she added. “I want to be able to make sure that there’s sustainability beyond me.”
A panel featuring Harvard Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability James H. Stock, HGSE Dean Bridget T. Long, and Spencer Glendon, a senior fellow at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, concluded the day’s event.
Stock said Harvard graduates should use their education to bring about great change and find new climate solutions.
“I like to end with the phrase that I’m sure many are familiar with: To whom much has been given, much is expected,” Stock said. “I think that is a very apt phrase for our students, and indeed, it’s an expectation that they can live up to.”
Asked how leaders in the education sector can start to take climate action, Goldson, the Maryland educator, gave a concise answer: “Don’t hesitate.”

Harvard affiliates called on the U.S. government to further reprimand the Iranian regime at a Thursday discussion with U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley.
The event — hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Foreign Policy Initiative in Sever Hall — included a conversation with Malley. Before the talk began, around fifteen protesters stood outside the building, holding signs and a banner that read “Iranians Want Regime Change! Be Their Voice!”
Once the event started, protesters joined the event and conversation with Malley. Demonstrators who were interviewed said their display was not in protest of the event itself, but rather U.S. foreign policy toward Iran.
Protests have erupted in Iran following the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Zhina Mahsa Amini in police custody after she allegedly broke the country’s rules on headscarves. Since protests began, more than 230 people, including at least 29 children, have been killed during demonstrations, according to Iran Human Rights.
One organizer of Thursday’s protest — who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about safety — said a goal of the display was to demand the U.S. delegitimize the Iranian regime.
HUFPI President Sama E. N. Kubba ’24 said in an interview after the event that the original format — a moderated conversation — transformed into an open dialogue.
“The envoy is engaging directly with Iranians and Iranian Americans, and that’s a very diplomatic conversation happening right now that honestly, I didn’t even think was possible,” Kubba said.
“We started this event just because we have an intellectual interest in Iran and the U.S.’s relationship with Iran, and obviously he is one of the players in that arena,” she added. "But this turned into a much more important dialogue"
During the event, which was off the record, Malley fielded questions directly from the audience, many of which came from the demonstrators.
Kubba said the candor of the conversation was “quite unprecedented for the State Department and quite unusual.”
“The fact that this even happened,” she said. “I’m really impressed.”
Thursday’s event marks at least the third demonstration in solidarity with Iranian protesters organized by Harvard affiliates in recent weeks. Last month, around 50 affiliates gathered on the steps of Widener Library, and last week, Harvard students staged a “die-in” before the John Harvard Statue.
Boston-area doctor Houman Amirfarzan said he attended the talk in hopes of influencing U.S. foreign policy toward Iran.
“The U.S. policy has been like this for the last 40 years, and it’s a failed policy – it’s not working,” he said.

A panel of health practitioners convened at the Harvard School of Public Health to discuss potential solutions to persisting challenges facing public health on Wednesday.
The event — in which panelists considered topics ranging from the allocation of scarce health resources to improving the accessibility of public health communication — is part of HSPH’s year-long series, “Public Health On the Brink.”
This series aims to address “urgent challenges” facing the public health field exposed by the pandemic, including equitable access to health care, per the School’s website.
“The pandemic really illuminated for me the fact that people have no clue what public health is quite often,” said panelist Tiffani L. Bell Washington, a diversity research scholar at the Nutrition Obesity Research Center at Harvard.
Bell Washington opened the panel with a discussion on combating the stigma around mental health.
“There’s so many negative spins in the news on people with mental health being blamed for various things like crimes,” Bell Washington said. “People are often afraid to even seek care.”
Bell Washington said she attempts to counteract such stigma by educating populations on the importance of seeking help.
Sarah Tsay, the director of emergency preparedness at Mass General Brigham, said effective public health policy depends on communicating with and bringing together “diverse stakeholders.”
“We need subject matter experts across the board to be public health champions,” Tsay said.
Teguo D. Djoyum, founder of the Global Organization of Health Education, said partnership between those funding and those implementing solutions to public health issues must be improved.
“A lot of people really want to solve problems, and some may have the know-how, the skillset, and they’re on the ground doing it,” Djoyum said. “Some may have the funds to do it, but they’re in different world, or in different department, but it would be nice to find a way where we can connect these two people, so they can all have the same vision.”
Though Bryan O. Buckley, the event’s moderator and director for health equity initiatives at the National Committee for Quality Assurance, acknowledged that the challenges raised by the panelists can be discouraging, he said he remains hopeful.
“Sometimes it feels like you’re ice skating uphill,” Buckley said.
“Every time I talk to new students or new people thinking about coming into public health, that gives me hope that the next generation is thinking about that work,” he added.
Djoyum, whose work involves destigmatizing and treating epilepsy, said he remains motivated by seeing the joy he can bring to his patients.
“Just the spark [of] light on the faces of people — every day when I think of those single stories, and there’s 40 million of them, there’s so much work,” he said. “And we need to get to it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of international relations experts discussed the implications of Russia’s war in Ukraine on the South Caucasus region at an event hosted by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies on Thursday.
The panel — moderated by the center’s Director on Georgian Studies Stephen F. Jones — covered the changing political dynamics of the war, including Georgia’s relationship with Russia and the European Union, as well as regional reliance on Russia.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, eight years after annexing the Ukrainian region of Crimea. After a series of referenda globally panned as shams held in September 2022, Russia declared its annexation of an additional four regions — Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Luhansk — though control of the territories remains contested.
Kurt D. Volker, former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said Putin’s actions reflect the belief that the Soviet Union’s collapse was “the greatest tragedy of the 20th century” and that there is “a need to rebuild Russian greatness.”
Volker, who was U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations under the Trump administration, added that the Russian government believes it has a right to the annexed territories, and that Putin has portrayed Ukrainians as “Russians who are confused about their identity.”
Beka Kobakhidze, a professor at Ilia State University in Georgia, said he spent two years in Ukraine’s Donbas region and described the desire of some Ukrainians to return to Russia as an “invitation to the past.”
“They mean going back to the Soviet Union,” Kobakhidze said. “They want to be again part of this greater thing, which was Soviet Union and which Putin wants to reassemble.”
Timothy J. Colton, a professor of Government and Russian Studies at Harvard, said Putin’s failures in the war have affected Russia’s reputation among countries in the Caucasus.
“When the leaders of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia think about their predicaments before they turn off the lights, they’re bound to think that Russia is less capable of achieving its objectives and less capable of helping them realize theirs than they thought was the case a year ago,” Colton said.
The war has put Georgia in a difficult position, according to Colton. While much of the population supports Ukraine, he explained, the government is still hesitant to take any action that might create tension with Russia.
Natalie Sabanadze, former head of the Georgian mission to the EU, said Georgia has adopted a position of “benevolent neutrality” toward Ukraine.
Despite the Georgian government’s hesitancy to jeopardize relations with Russia, Sabanadze said, the distraction to Russia and attention from the West caused by the war has created a unique opportunity for Georgia to become closer to the EU — though Sabanadze said she believes Georgia’s government has not taken full advantage of it.
Colton said it was unlikely either side could fully prevail in the war.
“[Russia] is mortgaging its future in an entirely negative way to pay for this military venture, and it’s hard to see anything favorable about that,” Colton said. “But whether it quote-unquote wins or not, I don’t think that total victory is possible for either side.”

A pair of psychology and legal experts discussed the role neuroscience plays in legal decisions about the death penalty at a panel hosted Thursday by the Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School.
The seminar featured Harvard Psychology professor Leah H. Somerville and Stephanie Tabashneck, a fellow at the Harvard Law School’s Center for Law Brain and Behavior.
The pair discussed the neurological research the Supreme Court has relied on for years when deciding cases related to the death penalty and life without parole sentencing for young adults.
Somerville discussed the key role the prefrontal cortex plays in decision-making.
“The prefrontal cortex may be of particular interest today because it’s crucial for a number of cognitive functions, like planning, decision making, and various forms of self-control, broadly construed,” she said.
She said the brain — including the prefrontal cortex — is not done developing by the age of 18 when Americans become legal adults. Adolescents’ underdeveloped brains can lead to riskier behaviors, depending on the environment in which people grow up, Somerville said.
“Adolescents aren’t uniformly having a taste for risk in every condition, but rather, … they’re susceptible to certain kinds of environments or contexts that might drive up that tendency to engage in greater risk-taking,” Somerville said.
Results from neuroscience research were cited in several Supreme Court decisions protecting adolescent offenders from capital punishment and life sentencing. In the 2004 case Roper v. Simmons, the court held that the execution of minors under the death penalty was unconstitutional. Justices banned life imprisonment without parole for minors in the 2011 case Miller v. Alabama.
“The court articulated that the general differences between kids under 18 and adults are also present for those who are older than 18,” Tabashneck said during the panel. “And they talked about the developing brain and held that the same protections that were present for those under 18 also applied to those who are 19 and 20.”
Neuroscience research shows that brain development continues well into young adulthood, Somerville said.
“If we’re talking about the white matter that sort of feeds in and out of the prefrontal cortex, there’s research showing that it doesn’t show a plateau until somewhere in the 30s,” she said. “And so putting a specific age marker on [full neurodevelopment] is very challenging.”

Longtime New York Times correspondent David E. Sanger ’82 discussed a documentary he produced alongside Emmy award-winning director John Maggio on the Biden administration’s first year at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday.
Sanger, who is also a Harvard Kennedy School adjunct lecturer in public policy and a former Crimson editor, opened the conversation with a tribute to his late friend, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter. Sanger said he met Carter for lunch on Monday, the day he died.
“Ash was fully engaged,” Sanger said. “He was full of humor, as usual. He seemed to be on top of his game — which makes this all the more tragic, what happened later on that night.”
Maggio said Covid-19 precautions created hurdles for him and Sanger while shooting the documentary.
“David and I, actually, were the test case for Warner Brothers,” Maggio said. “They let us shoot an interview, and we had created a plastic room, with plastic sheets between us, and they had cut a hole on the camera.”
At the time of filming, the White House had in place a 15-minute limit on in-person meetings and a five-person capacity for all rooms — a challenge given the number of crew members and public relations officers usually present for filming, Sanger said. He also addressed the difficulty of gaining the trust of cabinet members and convincing them to go on camera.
“It did take a while because no cabinet member wanted to go on and do this until they knew they had lots of company. No one wanted to be first. I think the first naturally was a Harvard graduate and a Crimson newspaper graduate, Tony Blinken,” he said, referring to the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken ’84.
The documentary relied mostly on firsthand accounts from Biden’s cabinet, along with commentary from journalists to tell its story.
To keep the documentary’s breadth roughly one year, as stated in the film’s title, Sanger and Maggio bookended the film with Biden’s inauguration in January 2021 and his State of the Union address in March 2022.
Sanger said in an interview that concluding the documentary with Biden’s State of the Union address put “ a punctuation mark on the first year.”
“In a first year, you set the tone,” Sanger said. “The impressions you get — and that the American public gets — about any new administration in the first year is likely to set their impressions for the next three, or the next seven.”
In response to pre-release skepticism that the HBO documentary would be too favorable to the Biden administration, Sanger invited the audience to watch the film’s coverage of Biden’s pullout from Afghanistan and “see what a lovefest it is.”
To close the forum, Sanger offered advice to his 18-year-old self.
“You only get four years,” he said of his time at Harvard. “So like I said before about the lessons from Ash’s life is — don’t waste a day.”

President Joe Biden’s approval rating remains under water among young Americans, according to the fall 2022 Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll, released on Thursday.
The survey found that 39 percent of younng Americans view Biden favorably — down from 41 percent last spring.
The Harvard Public Opinion Project, a student group within the IOP, polled more than 2,000 Americans between 18 and 29 years old from Sept. 29 to Oct. 14. HPOP, founded in 2000, conducts youth surveys twice per year.
While low, Biden’s youth rating among young Americans exceeds that of President Donald J. Trump during his second year in office. At this point in Trump’s term in 2018, the IOP Youth Poll recorded his approval rating at 26 percent.
Tommy Barone ’25, a member of HPOP, said during a press conference the approval trends may be linked to “the information bubble that many young Americans increasingly occupy.”
“Among respondents who followed the news very closely, Biden received 48 percent approval, which is a shocking 20 points higher than those who do not follow the news,” said Barone, a Crimson Editorial editor.
Despite the drop in Biden’s approval since March, the poll found that a majority of young Americans approve of three major Democratic accomplishments over the summer — the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan gun safety law, and a student debt forgiveness plan rolled out in August.
“Levels of support for the Democrats amongst young voters were already incredibly high,” said HPOP member Kate Gundersen ’23. “A five-point bump in support for the Democrats since the spring indicates that young voters are ready to reward Democrats for their work over the summer and endorse them to continue the fight for the issues that they care about.”
The students who conducted the poll outlined five main takeaways, spanning a range of issues related to the 2022 midterm elections.
Youth turnout is projected to be high in November, with 40 percent of surveyed young Americans indicating they will “definitely” vote — levels similar to turnout in the 2018 midterms.
“It was galvanized by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, concerns about the erosion of rights, and again the specter of President Trump’s movement,” HPOP chair Alan F. Zhang ’24 said during the press conference. “Young people are poised to match the trends and turnout records we set four years ago.”
The poll also found that the number of young voters who favor a Democrat-controlled Congress is more than double the number opposed to it, with 57 percent responding in favor and 31 percent opposed.
When it came to rights, young Americans are more concerned about the rights of others than their own, the survey found. While 72 percent of young Americans “believe that the rights of others are under attack,” only 59 percent said they feel “their own rights are under attack.”
Respondents who identify as LGBTQ+ were most likely to feel under attack, with 72 percent reporting concerns about their individual rights.
“Young Americans who feel their rights are under attack are more likely to vote than those who don’t feel that their rights are under attack,” HPOP member Ethan L. Jasny ’25 said at the press conference.
A plurality of young Republicans, 39 percent, cited inflation as the most important issue behind how they will vote in November. Young Democrats pointed to abortion, protecting democracy, climate change, and inflation as the determinants of their vote next month.
“Our findings this fall indicate that young people continue to be galvanized to vote and engage at historic levels,” Zhang said. “But this engagement is also compounded by deep concerns about threats to American democracy and attacks upon their own rights.”

For Angie Shin '23, moving from high school to Harvard revealed the necessity of affirmative action.
A first-generation, low-income student, Shin graduated from a public high school with one of the worst academic performance ratings in California, she said.
“Coming to Harvard and experiencing the privileges of a private education, privileges of going to one of the most renowned universities in the world, there was a lot of burden on myself to really digest what that meant for my friends growing up and what that means for communities across the country today not being able to benefit from billion dollar institutions,” Shin said.
Shin is one of roughly 100 Harvard undergraduates headed to Washington, D.C. this weekend to rally in support of affirmative action. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in an affirmative action lawsuit against the University on Oct. 31.
The suit, brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges that Harvard College discriminates against Asian American applicants by considering race in its admissions process.
Shin attributes her “meaningful and fulfilling” college experience to the “community of diversity.”
“When it comes to my personal motivations for organizing for this case, it’s because I really do believe that affirmative action does increase diversity in higher ed,” said Shin, a former president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association.
Shin also co-leads the Affirmative Action Coalition, which organizes advocacy events and communicates with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund on behalf of student groups the fund represents.
This weekend, undergraduates will travel to Washington, D.C. on a trip organized by AAC to rally in front of the Supreme Court and in Franklin Park.
“There’s going to be a really awesome and diverse group of enthusiastic students and activists who are going down there directly to the Supreme Court outside while the oral argument is happening, and saying diversity does make a difference,” said AAC co-lead and Black Students Association board member David E. Lewis ’24.
Per Shin, the trip received funding from advocacy group Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, the NAACP LDF, and Harvard’s Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, which provided a $15,000 grant. On Sunday, the Harvard Undergraduate Association approved a $2,700 disbursement for AAC to subsidize meals for student protesters on the trip.
Leading up to the oral arguments, AAC is hosting a campus “Week of Action,” including an open mic event, a poster-making party, and a Friday rally on Massachusetts Avenue.
Kashish Bastola ’26, who helped organize the open mic event Monday, said he hoped the week would make advocacy “more available and accessible to our community.”
“We want to bring in as many people as we can,” Bastola said. “I hope this Week of Action can tap into the various communities that we have on campus that would possibly be interested in engaging with us, but maybe don’t know how or don’t have enough information.”
Like Shin, AAC co-lead Emma H. Lu ’26 emphasized the importance of fighting for a diverse campus.
“Maybe partially because I’m Asian, people have asked me, ‘Oh, affirmative action — are you for or against?’ And I hate that there is that kind of question,” Lu said. “Diversity is ultimately the goal and something that is to be celebrated.”
AAC co-lead and Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association board member Kylan M. Tatum ’25 said he values diversity because of his “multiracial, multiethnic and multinational background.”
“Both Black and Asian myself, I’ve been very interested in trying to combat decentralization and the stereotypes that have really been attacking both sides,” Tatum said. “That’s how I found myself involved in the affirmative action case, and the work has been great so far.”
Muskaan Arshad ’25, who interns for Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, said she has been involved in diversity advocacy at the College even prior to the Supreme Court’s decision to hear SFFA’s case.
“Harvard’s diversity is one of the best things about it,” Arshad said. “I grew up in Arkansas. It was very white, very, very homogenous, and it definitely didn’t feel like a space that I was accepted in. And all of that completely changed when I came to Harvard.”
AAC co-lead and AAA board member Chelsea Wang ’25 encouraged students to continue advocating for affirmative action even after the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Oct. 31.
“It’s going to be a very long movement, no matter how the court rules, because we won’t get the decision until May,” Wang said. “So up until then, we should all be doing as much as possible to continue talking about affirmative action.”

The Supreme Court will hear lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina next week. The verdicts have the potential to end race-conscious admissions at colleges across the country.
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first filed suit against the universities in 2014, arguing that they discriminated against Asian American applicants. Following lower court decisions that upheld the schools’ race-conscious admissions policies, SFFA appealed to the Supreme Court, asking it to overturn precedent and declare affirmative action unconstitutional.
Here are the lawyers who will take the lectern on Oct. 31 on behalf of Harvard, SFFA, and UNC.
A partner at law firm WilmerHale, Waxman was asked to represent the University by then-General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 when SFFA first sued Harvard. Though William F. Lee ’72 — another WilmerHale partner and former senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — served as lead counsel during the trial stages, it will be Waxman who stands before the Court next week.
Waxman will be returning to a familiar position: As the United States Solicitor General from 1997 to 2001, Waxman was the country's lawyer for all litigation in the Supreme Court, arguing over 80 times before the body. Two of his highest-profile cases included Boumediene v. Bush and Roper v. Simmons, which concerned the rights of prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay and the constitutionality of the juvenile death penalty, respectively.
Raised in a Jewish family in Connecticut, Waxman concentrated in Sociology at the College from 1969 to 1973 before graduating from Yale Law School in 1977. He served on the Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — from 2005 to 2012 and was president of the body from 2010 to 2011.
Norris argue before the Court on short notice — last week, SFFA’s lead counsel William S. Consovoy withdrew from oral arguments to seek treatment for brain cancer.
An alum of Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Law School, Norris clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas before being promoted to partner at law firm Consovoy McCarthy in January.
The 34-year-old has argued successfully before the Supreme Court once before on behalf of CIC Services, an insurance company that sued the Internal Revenue Service. The Court ruled unanimously in favor of CIC services.
Norris has previously argued on behalf of right-leaning entities, including the Republican National Committee. He also represented former President Donald J. Trump in his court battle with the House Ways and Means Committee, which sought to access his tax returns.
Strawbridge will represent SFFA in its lawsuit against the University of North Carolina.
Another partner at Consovoy McCarthy, he will appear before the Supreme Court for the second time next week. His first appearance was two years ago, when he, along with William S. Consovoy and Cameron T. Norris, represented former President Donald J. Trump in a lawsuit regarding his tax returns.
After graduating from the University of Missouri, Strawbridge worked as a reporter before attending Creighton University School of Law. Like Consovoy and Norris, Strawbridge also clerked for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. He teaches at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where Consovoy also serves on the faculty.
Strawbridge has previously argued against the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate and defended the State of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban on behalf of the state. He will be the first to stand before the Court, as the UNC case will be heard before Harvard’s.
Serving as the Solicitor General for North Carolina since 2020, Park will represent UNC. Previously, Park served as Deputy Solicitor General from 2017 to 2020.
Park, whose family emigrated from South Korea to North Carolina in the 1970s, attended Amherst College before attending Harvard Law School, where he graduated summa cum laude in 2010. After law school, he clerked for two Supreme Court justices — former justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter ’61. Park has argued before the body once previously: In 2019, he represented North Carolina in a copyright lawsuit, a case he won.
Prior to his work in the North Carolina Department of Justice, Park served as counsel at the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Justice and also worked at an international law firm. He has argued over a dozen times on behalf of the state in North Carolina and federal courts.
Along with his duties as state solicitor general, Park lectures at Duke University and teaches at UNC Law School.
In addition to Waxman, Norris, Strawbridge, and Park, two other attorneys will make oral arguments before the court: U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar will argue for the Biden administration on behalf of Harvard and UNC, while David S. Hinojosa of the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights will argue on behalf of UNC student respondents.

Following eight years of litigation, the Supreme Court will hear on Monday a pair of lawsuits brought against Harvard and the University of North Carolina by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
The group, led by activist Edward J. Blum, has long held that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants and that its admissions program is unconstitutional because it considers race as a factor in admissions.
The Court’s ruling on the two cases may decide the future of affirmative action in higher education. Here’s what you need to know ahead of Monday’s oral arguments.
How did we get here?
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014. The group alleged that the University’s admissions practices are “racially and ethnically discriminatory” and argued that Harvard was engaging in “racial balancing” by considering race in admissions. SFFA claimed Harvard’s admissions policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
Following a high profile district court ruling in favor of Harvard in 2019, SFFA appealed to the First Circuit Court. In 2020, the circuit court ruled 2-0 in favor of the University, affirming SFFA’s legal standing to sue but ruling that Harvard did not violate civil rights law.
Three months later, in February 2021, SFFA appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court agreed in January 2022 to hear the SFFA case. Over the summer, 81 Republican lawmakers, 20 states, and a former Attorney General submitted briefs in support of SFFA, while hundreds of corporations and universities, including Apple and Google, submitted filings in support of affirmative action.
What are the parties arguing?
According to its opening brief filed with the Supreme Court in May, SFFA wants the Court to entirely eliminate affirmative action in higher education admissions by overturning its decision in the 2003 case Grutter v. Bollinger.
The Grutter case ruled that an admission program that considers race as one of many factors in order to ensure a diverse student body does not violate the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.
“Grutter should be overruled,” SFFA’s opening brief reads, adding that the case “satisfies every factor that this Court considers when deciding to overrule precedent.”
“It was wrong the day it was decided, has spawned significant negative consequences, and has generated no legitimate reliance interests,” it adds.
Harvard has long argued the legality of its admissions process and the value of diversity in its student body.
The lower courts’ previous rulings in Harvard’s favor “were correct then and remain correct today,” the University argued in its response brief filed with the Supreme Court in July.
“Our Constitution promises ‘equal protection of the laws,’” the brief states. “It does not require us to disregard the commonsense reality that race is one among many things that shape life experiences in meaningful ways.”
In a statement released with the Harvard’s filing, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that diversity is “central to fulfilling” the school’s educational mission and “enhances education for all.”
“We remain steadfast in our belief that every college and university must retain the freedom and flexibility to create the diverse educational communities that will prepare their students for the opportunities and challenges they will confront in an increasingly diverse society.”
Will Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 participate in the case?
Newly-seated Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 announced during her confirmation hearings in March that she would recuse herself from the Harvard case. Jackson graduated from the College and Harvard Law School and completed a six-year term on the University’s Board of Overseers in the spring.
How does the UNC lawsuit fit?
The same day SFFA sued Harvard in 2014, it filed a parallel lawsuit against the University of North Carolina. Because UNC is a public institution, the lawsuit invokes the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment.
When the Supreme Court agreed to hear SFFA’s lawsuit against Harvard, it also took up the case against UNC, consolidating the two lawsuits. But it reversed its course and split the cases in July, a move that will allow Jackson to weigh in on the UNC case.
What’s next? 
Legal representation for Harvard will be from Seth P. Waxman ‘73, a former United States Solicitor General while UNC will be represented by North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park. SFFA’s case will be argued by Cameron T. Norris of Consovoy McCarthy.
Oral arguments are scheduled for Monday, though the Court’s opinion on the case is not expected until the summer of 2023.

Students For Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing Harvard for its consideration of race in its admissions, is largely funded by conservative trusts, according to public filings since 2017.
Though Edward Blum, the legal strategist behind SFFA, told the New York Times the group had received more than 5,000 individual contributions, a handful of conservative foundations make up the bulk of its funding. These include DonorsTrust, the Searle Freedom Trust, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the 85 Fund.
SFFA, which first sued Harvard in 2014, alleges the College’s race-conscious admissions practices discriminate against Asian American applicants and violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in January 2022, one year after SFFA’s appeal.
Harvard has denied the allegations, with University President Lawrence S. Bacow decrying the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case.
In all, SFFA has spent less than $8 million on its affirmative action suits against Harvard and the University of North Carolina, according to Blum. From 2015 to 2020 — the last year for which filings are available — SFFA received more than $8.5 million in contributions to fund their legal battles.
Public filings show conservative fund DonorsTrust contributed $2.5 million to SFFA from 2017 to 2019. Their largest contribution — a $1.5 million donation that was more than 50 percent of SFFA’s funding that year — came in 2018. The Searle Freedom Trust also contributed a significant chunk of SFFA’s overall donations, with $500,000 in contributions annually from 2017 to 2019.
DonorsTrust spokesperson Carolyn Bolton confirmed in a statement that the fund donated $2.5 million to Students for Fair Admissions from 2017 to 2019, though they granted a total of $416 million to charitable organizations over that time period.
“The sum granted out to Students for Fair Admissions during that three-year time frame reflects our commitment to honoring donor intent and helping our givers support charities that align with their diverse interests,” Bolton wrote in a statement. “DonorsTrust is not involved in how Students for Fair Admissions operates or how it achieves its organizational mission.”
The Crimson reported in 2019 that the Searle Freedom Trust and Donors Trust together contributed $750,000 to SFFA in 2016, constituting nearly three-quarters of the group’s total donations.
The Sarah Scaife Foundation, set up by the Scaife family and previously controlled by late conservative activist and philanthropist Richard Mellon Scaife, contributed $650,000 to SFFA from 2017 to 2019, according to the foundation’s tax disclosures. The foundation has a long history of donating to conservative causes and think tanks, including the Heritage Foundation.
SFFA also received a $250,000 donation in 2020 from The 85 Fund, a trust connected to conservative lawyer and Donald Trump ally Leonardo Leo.
James S. Murphy, a senior policy analyst at think tank Education Reform Now, said much of Blum’s success in bringing his battles to the Supreme Court would not be possible if not for wealthy donors.
“None of this happens if [Blum’s] not raising millions of dollars,” Murphy said. “The only way that [SFFA] can afford this case is through these organizations that funnel money from very wealthy individuals to causes like his.”
Other smaller donors to SFFA include Asian American political advocacy group 80-20 Initiative. According to S.B. Woo, the group’s president, 80-20 has donated a total of $50,000 to SFFA from 2019 to 2022.
“Since our mission is to secure equal opportunity, we feel very strongly that Asian American students have been discriminated by Harvard’s admissions policy,” Woo said in an interview.
The Xie Foundation, which makes grants on behalf of Fortinet co-founders Ken and Michael Xie, contributed $10,000 in 2019.
A small amount of annual revenue for SFFA comes from their one-time membership fee, which amounted to a total of just $23,660 from 2015 to 2019. SFFA has stated that it has more than 20,000 members.
Prior to founding SFFA, Blum created the Project on Fair Representation, which also aims to challenge race-conscious policies. PFR received around $1 million in contributions and paid out $2.5 million in legal expenses from 2015 to 2020, according to public filings.
Since 2016, Blum has annually compensated himself $48,000 for his work with SFFA and an additional $120,000 for his work on the Project on Fair Representation.
The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments for the case on Oct. 31.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Edward J. Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action group suing Harvard — the end of a long game has arrived.
For almost three decades, Blum, who is not a lawyer, has been knee-deep in litigation: Since 1996, he has orchestrated eight lawsuits that have made it to the U.S. Supreme Court, including some of the most prominent efforts to strike down affirmative action policies and voting rights laws of the modern era.
In 2005, Blum founded the Project on Fair Representation, which led a pair of anti-affirmative action lawsuits against the University of Texas at Austin on behalf of Abigail N. Fisher, a rejected white applicant who said the school racially discriminated against her. The two landmark cases rose to the Supreme Court, but justices left race conscious policies mostly intact, spelling a pair of losses for Blum and anti-affirmative action activists.
While the Fisher cases worked their way through the courts, Blum continued his charge against affirmative action, establishing Students for Fair Admissions in 2014 as an offshoot of the Project on Fair Representation. Through SFFA, Blum filed two more lawsuits — this time denouncing the race-conscious admissions practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
Now, Blum is headed back to the Supreme Court for the first time since the Fisher cases. He will be greeted this time by the most conservative court in generations, which is set to consider his most far-reaching argument yet: Race-conscious admissions across the board should go.
SFFA’s arguments brought against Harvard and UNC, which are set to be heard by the Supreme Court on Monday, mark a departure from previous legal strategies used by Blum and his lawyers.
In the Fisher cases, lawyers from the Project on Fair Representation argued that UT Austin’s consideration of race in admissions unfairly penalized Fisher, a white applicant, and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The court had upheld the use of race as one factor in higher education admissions in 2003 through landmark cases Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger, which examined the University of Michigan’s admissions policies.
The project’s lawyers called on the court to strike down UT Austin’s admissions policies on the basis that the school was inconsistent with affirmative action practices allowed by the court’s precedent.
But in its ongoing lawsuits against Harvard and UNC, SFFA has taken a bolder approach, asking justices to ban the consideration of race in admissions altogether by reversing past precedent.
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, arguing that the school’s admissions policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits institutions that receive federal funding from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
The Massachusetts District Court ruled in favor of Harvard in October 2019 in a decision dubbed a “slam dunk for Harvard.”
The First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the lower court’s decision in November 2020 after an appeal from the SFFA.
Several months later, SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case against Harvard, requesting what some legal experts say was SFFA’s ultimate aim in filing the suit: for the Supreme Court to declare all race-conscious admissions unconstitutional and reverse the precedent set by the Grutter case.
“There is a lack of consistency in the sales pitch for this case,” Loyola Law School professor Kimberly West-Faulcon said. “But the actual goal — the legal goal — has always been the same.”
West-Faulcon said she believes “it’s very much on the table” that the Supreme Court will strike down the Grutter case and its precedent that favors race-conscious admissions.
“That’s what those who filed this case back in 2014 had always been banking on,” she said. “This has been a long game.”
Compared to the group’s previous litigation, SFFA’s lawsuit against Harvard also featured a shift in the players involved: While the Fisher cases centered on a white student, Blum actively recruited Asian American applicants to serve as plaintiffs for the Harvard case.
“The last series of cases — Fisher as well as the two cases in Michigan — all failed, and those were with white plaintiffs,” said Mike Hoa Nguyen, an assistant professor of education at New York University. “Recruiting Asian American students in order to levy this lawsuit then makes it much more complex.”
Court-watchers anticipate a ruling in favor of SFFA due to the court’s 6-3 conservative make-up, but maintain that the court is unpredictable.
UNC Law School professor Osamudia R. James said she was “not optimistic” about a decision in favor of Harvard and that the court is “in a mood for overturning precedent.”
James said the court may ask Harvard to reconsider its use of race in admissions or, in a more likely scenario, do away with the idea that a goal of achieving a diverse student body can justify the consideration of race in higher education.
Both West-Faulcon and Devon Westhill, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, cited the court’s decision in June to end the constitutional right to abortion as suggesting its willingness to overturn precedent.
“Until this iteration of the court, it was frowned upon by justices to simply vote to overrule a case because you disagreed with how it was,” West-Faulcon said. “It used to be very important to the justices to say we should have consistency in the law, and that there needs to be something extraordinary about this case.”
Though the court is not expected to release its ruling on the Harvard case until months after Monday’s oral arguments, race-conscious admissions in higher education could soon be a relic of the past, spelling a long-awaited victory for Blum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams raced across the country on Friday, October 14. Just south of Madison, Wis., juniors Acer Iverson and Maia Ramsden led Crimson squads into battle against some of the nation’s best at the Nuttycombe Invitational. On the east coast, at the famed Van Cortlandt Park course in Manhattan, N.Y., sophomores Ella Gilson and Reed Pryor headed another pair of Harvard teams at the ECAC Championships, facing Ivy League rivals Princeton, Cornell, and Yale along the way. The men's teams finished 21st in Wisconsin and 8th in New York, while the women’s teams placed 5th at Nuttycombe and 29th at Van Cortlandt.
“Nuttycombe is probably the most competitive meet of the preseason before championship season starts.” Iverson said. “We’re facing all the teams that will be at nationals and all the individuals who are going to be there, so it's a really good metric to see where we are standing right now and a great opportunity to figure out what we need to work on five weeks from now when we come to the NCAA National Championship.”
The emergence of the Crimson’s top runners to the front pack of the entire NCAA provides a beacon of hope for the Harvard teams that had lost key pieces of last year's teams to eligibility. Iverson and junior Graham Banks headline the top men’s returners, while Ramsden returns once again as a vital point scorer.
Iverson and Banks went head-to-head with a talented top pack in the 8K at Nuttycombe, which included U20 5000 meter American Record Holder Nico Young of Northern Arizona University and U23 European Cross Country Champion Charles Hicks of Stanford. Iverson placed 8th in a time of 23:22.1, just 10 seconds behind the top finisher Ky Robinson of Stanford and Young in second, while Banks finished closely behind in 26th in 23:31.5. On the women's side, Ramsden placed 7th in the 6K in 20:04.5 against a pack led by NCAA 1500 and 5000 meter champion Katelyn Tuohy.
The move to racing in the front pack of the NCAA is a new but exciting experience for these top returners, especially in terms of racing strategy.
“I think in a lot of ways for cross country, racing at the front simplifies your life,” Ramsden said. “I dont think it’s easier, per se, but from a tactical standpoint. It's a lot less mentally taxing to have the goal be stuck with the girls that are leading because once you get [outside the front 30 runners] it gets tricky; you feel a little bit like you’re swimming in people until the race strings out, whereas at the start of a big race if you know you can hang with that top pack you can figure out your game plan.”
Nevertheless, it seems easy to be overwhelmed by all of the accolades constituting this top group. Relating to that point, Iverson described how having a mindset focusing on the race itself is essential for successful racing execution.
“When you’re in the moment you can't think about… about who those individuals [in front of you] are” said Iverson. “If you trust in your training, you know that you’re comfortable there and you can be there, and that’s the most important part in staying collected and executing.”
Rounding out the Crimson’s scoring positions on the men’s side were senior David Melville in 140th, and first-years Shane Brosnan and Vivien Henz in 179th and 191st, respectively. With critical point scorer Matthew Pereira having graduated in the class of 2022, having a combination of upperclassmen experience, talent, and youth provides Harvard hope for great improvement not only years down the road, but also in the immediate future.
“With a senior or even a junior, you know more or less where they should be in a pack and how fast they can really run,” Iverson said. “These freshmen have been on Harvard’s campus for two months. They have a long way to go in terms of metabolizing the training, learning how to race against a huge number of really talented competitors, so with the promising results we saw at Nuttycombe, I think we can go even further with. The room for potential is a lot higher.”
Although the Crimson team's did not place extremely highly at the meet, Harvard’s results in the postseason typically surpass those at Nuttycombe, namely at the NCAA Championship meet.
“I would say our approach as a team has always been just to treat it as another chance to practice good racing habits, but we’re not necessarily going to taper or change our training for it, so sometimes our race results don't necessarily reflect where we were at as a team,” Ramsden said. “So that’s definitely what happened last year. We did reasonably well at Nuttycombe, but we ended up beating a lot of those teams that beat us there later on in the season because we peaked for some of those later races. I think our [head coach] does a very good job at that.”
Following Ramsden on the women’s side, Maya Rayle (105th) scored second for the Crimson in a time of 20:56.0, while Isabelle Goldstein (165th), Penelope Salmon (191st) and Kristin Otervik (200th) filled out positions three through five.
In New York, strength in youth and numbers was also reflected. At the ECAC Championship, Ella Gilson led the women’s team by taking 7th place in a time of 21:28.3 in the 6K. Gilson makes up part of the Harvard women’s squad that boasts strength in numbers, which is a crucial element of any team hoping to make a deep postseason run.
“This is an extremely exciting year for us, and I know our coach is super excited about how we have been doing,” Gilson said. “I'm pretty sure this is the deepest team that Harvard’s women's cross country has ever had, and hopefully it will be the best team that we’ve had so far.”
Past just depth, a majority of Harvard women’s team have multiple years of eligibility after this season, keeping their core intact as they progress in the future.
Other Harvard scorers at Van Cortlandt on the women's side included Marianne Mihas (13th), Shakes Leibovitz (57th), Zoe Cooper (90th) and Cristina Demeo (138th). The Crimson beat Ivy League rivals Yale, Princeton and Columbia while falling just two points behind Cornell.
On the men’s side, sophomore Reed Pryor (36th) was Harvard’s top scorer with a time of 25:02.7 in the 8K. Finishing close behind were Noah Ward (49th), Sameer Das (52nd), Pierce Cousins (70th) and Ben Shryock (101th). Princeton won the meet.
The Crimson now shifts its focus towards the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, returning to Van Cortlandt Park in New York City, N.Y.,on October 28th, and towards the rest of the postseason, which may stretch all the way to the NCAA Championship meet for both squads on November 19th at Oklahoma State University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard competed with the best tennis players in the Northeast last weekend at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Super Regionals, hosted at the Beren Tennis Center. The Crimson represented 11 of the 32 players who qualified for the last stop on the road to the ITA Fall Nationals.
“To have 11 of the top 32 [players] wearing crimson was quite an honor,” said head coach Andrew Rueb ‘95.
Senior captain Harris Walker, No. 39,  was the No. 3 seed in the tournament and advanced to the final without dropping a single set. Even when rain interrupted play and forced the final match indoors, Walker maintained the momentum and defeated Columbia’s Alex Kotzen, the top seed in the tournament, 6-2, 7-5. In the final match, Columbia first-year Michael Zheng took the championship after a tough three-set battle, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4. Walker finished as the tournament’s runner-up and will compete in the ITA Fall Nationals in November.
Harvard saw early upsets in the Round of 32. Despite a comeback in the second set, sophomore Daniel Milavsky, No. 7 seed in the tournament, was ousted by Yale’s Michael Sun 6-2, 7-6 (8-6). Sophomore Elisha Thornton also fell after a second-set tiebreaker to Aditya Gupta of the University of Pennsylvania, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3). In the first round of doubles, similarly close competition made for exciting matches. Just a few key points kept the duo of Milavsky and junior Ronan Jachuk from victory; eventual champions JJ Bianchi and Max Motlagh of Boston College won the match 8-4.
In the Round of 16, the Crimson competed in multiple three-set matches. Junior Captain Henry von der Schulenburg, No. 18, was defeated by tournament finalist Westfal in a close battle, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. Jachuk and freshman Melchoir Delloye also lost in three-set matches that day.
“I mean this is why you play,” said Rueb of the tight competition at the tournament. “The pressure is a privilege, and you get the honor of playing close matches against good competition; that’s sort of what you earn.”
In the quarterfinals, the excitement continued, with just two Harvard players remaining in the draw. First-year Marc Ktiri faced off against Columbia’s Michael Zheng, No. 3, and ultimately lost 6-2, 7-5. Meanwhile, Walker handily defeated Dartmouth’s Hikaru Takeda, 6-4, 6-1.
Coach Rueb emphasized these close competitions, and the fall season in general, as key opportunities for growth. Team competition starts in January, making the fall a time for individual players to hone their skills.
“It is a developmental time,” Rueb emphasized. “This is the time to make adjustments, make changes in your game. You have to have that developmental mindset now especially.”
The Crimson closed out the Spring 2022 season at No. 14 after winning the Ivy League Championships and suffering defeat to Stanford in the second round of the NCAA tournament. With new players added to the roster, the fall poses an opportunity to find new strengths.
“The teams that use the fall wisely are really progressing and getting ready for that all-important season that starts in January. It’s a building block, the fall,” Rueb explained. “Obviously it’s a great honor for [Walker to advance to Fall Nationals], but the big goal here is to keep improving, and stacking some great practices on top of each other so that you’re making those improvements.”
Harvard will host men’s and women’s teams for the annual Crimson Halloween Invite this weekend, Oct. 28-Oct. 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of spectators flocked to the Charles River to watch collegiate, club, and international rowers take part in the historic Head of the Charles Regatta. The race started near the Boston University Boathouse, running three miles upstream past Harvard’s campus. This year, the river was packed with vendors and volunteers, bringing an even greater density of visitors to the Square for this exciting three-day event.
With the Regatta being tied to Harvard throughout its 55-year historical tradition, all four Crimson rowing teams opened their seasons at this regatta. Different Harvard boats won big at home, taking gold and silver medals back to their boathouses.
Set to race a Championship Double, two Lightweight Fours, and one Lightweight Eight, the Radcliffe lightweights performed exceptionally well for their opening races of the year.
Although the Championship Double boat placed fourteenth, the other two races were rather exciting for the Black and White.
The Lightweights had two boats in the twelve-team Fours race. One boat took eleventh place and the other took fifth with a time of 18:22.710, just 15.785 seconds behind the winners, British Columbia.
The crown jewel for the Radcliffe lightweights was the Lightweight Eights race, in which they took home the gold medal. Rowing with familiar competitors Princeton, Boston University, and Georgetown, Harvard edged out the Tigers by just 1.559 seconds to take first place.
The Women’s lightweights will next head down to Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J. for the Princeton Chase on Sunday, Nov. 7.
The Radcliffe heavyweights competed in five races: one Club Four, one Club Eight, one Championship Double, one Championship Four, and one Championship Eight.
Despite placing towards the bottom for the Championship races, the heavyweights placed near the top for the Club Four and Club Eight.
In the Club Four, the Harvard boat took an impressive fourth place among over 50 boats with a time of 18:31.757, trailing Georgetown and Boston University, with Vesta Rowing Club of London, England crossing the line first.
In the Club Eight race, the heavyweights earned the silver medal in a race of 40 boats. The Crimson recorded a time of 16:30.348, just 2.372 seconds slower than first-place Drexel.
Next, the Radcliffe heavyweights will row in the Foot of the Charles to close out their fall season on Saturday, Nov. 12.
The Crimson competed in two races on Sunday: the Lightweight Four and the Lightweight Eight, and were well-represented in both races.
In the Four race, one Harvard boat took fifth place among 16 boats, posting a time of 16:04.279. Ivy foe Penn finished among the top three, besting the 16-minute mark with a 15:58.089.
One Harvard squad claimed first place in the Lightweight Eight race. Its winning time of 13:59.587 was enough to top Princeton and Yale, as well as Georgetown. The other Harvard boat in the race put up a respectable 15:13.991 finish, taking thirteenth place among the fifteen boats.
This gold medal-winning finish for the Harvard lightweights was an exciting beginning to a much longer journey, which will continue at the Foot of the Charles next Saturday before picking back up in warmer waters next spring.
This year, the Harvard heavyweights took part in a special fundraising event during the Head of the Charles Regatta. The team rowed to fundraise for the Robert Connor Dawes Foundation and the Red Sox Foundation, raising just under $7,000.
The Robert Connor Dawes Foundation supports research, care, and development in the field of pediatric brain cancer. Meanwhile, the Red Sox Foundation, the official charity of the Boston Red Sox, works to support local youth, families, Veterans, and communities in terms of health, education, and recreation.
The Crimson took home a gold medal in the Club Eight race in its mission to fundraise for these two foundations. Harvard posted a swift 14:20.881, nearly seven seconds faster than second-place finisher Brown. Just behind the first-place Crimson rowers was another Harvard boat, which came fourth in 14:36.466. Nearly all of the top five places in the Club Eight race were from the Ivy League besides the third-place finishers, Cambridge locals Riverside Boat Club.
Two Harvard boats competed in the Club Four race, taking 18th and 23rd place among over 45 boats. Harvard also had two boats in the Championship Eight, placing fourth and tenth in the 25-boat race.
The heavies will close their fall season at the Foot of the Charles on Saturday, Nov. 12.

Dear struggling Harvard students,
Whether it’s the seasonal depression, mid-semester roommate beef, or a dreadful midterm for the class you barely go to, this time of year is always a bit rough. Even with holiday festivities (~spooky season~), it’s normal to be a bit gloomy this time of year. But don’t worry — whether you’re a first year or a senior, here are some words of encouragement from us here at Flyby because yes, you CAN get through this semester.
Hot Take: Cramming is Normal — You CAN Bounce Back. 
Maybe you only have a few days before your midterm, and are feeling absolutely terrible because you understand -13949702 percent of the content, your time management skills are nonexistent, and you skipped section that one day. Take a deep breath. Harvard schedules are notoriously difficult to navigate and sometimes, no matter how organized you are, you end up having to skip club meetings, cancel shifts at work, and cram your studying. You’re allowed to slip up and cram — in fact, so many other students are in a similar situation. Now, do your best and study when you can, and you’ll be able to cross that midterm off your to-do list ;)
Fake It ’Til You Make It 
Even if you feel like you can’t manifest a decent grade in that midterm — you gotta fake it ’til you make it! Go look in a mirror and tell yourself that you’re the smartest person in the world who is going to ace that assignment or exam (maybe don’t do this in the communal bathrooms if you don’t want people to think you’re crazy — or do, for a little drama ;)).
You Come First! 
Drink water, sleep eight hours a day, eat ALL your meals. It doesn’t matter what you get on that exam if you aren’t taking care of yourself. Exams come and go, but your health will follow you. Take care of yourself and try your best — literally nothing else matters more than you.
Reality Check: Life Goes On
Take a deep breath and realize doing poorly on a midterm or assignment is not the end of the world. You will still get that internship, research position or acceptance to graduate school. You are still a Harvard student and will graduate on time (if you want to). Best of all, you can take a few gems and raise that GPA. There is never an end-all-be-all, we promise.
Keep on trudging, Flyby readers — we believe in you! Before you know it, you’ll be getting ready with your friends for Halloween, Harvard-Yale, Thanksgiving, and formals season — our favorite parts of the semester are right around the corner.
