Remember dodging around construction trucks in the Yard to get to class last semester? Not to worry, because it appears that the construction work is in fact back, specifically in the space between Weld and Widener. It does not block the walkways from Mass. Ave., for those of you who like to head late to class and use that path instead.
Luckily, it’s not in one of the more prime locations for tourist pictures, though it’s a shame that everyone’s favorite statue in front of Boylston is removed from plain sight!
