After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATE: Saturday, September 8, 2012, at 11:31 a.m.
Cote K. Laramie ’14, a psychology concentrator and resident of Pforzheimer House, died Thursday, House administrators announced in an email to students.
“Many of us knew and loved Cote as a friend, and we mourn his passing,” wrote House Masters Nicholas A. and Erika L. Christakis and Resident Dean Lisa Boes. “Cote’s death is a terrible blow to every member of Pfoho. It is a shock to us.... It is especially poignant, coming at the very beginning of the year.”
Laramie took his own life at his home in Pembroke, N.H.
Pforzheimer residents were invited to a visiting hour Saturday morning at 11 a.m. in the Masters’ residence. On Friday night and Saturday morning, students wrote messages remembering Laramie and tacked them to a posterboard in the House lobby.
“You always astounded me with your enthusiasm and thirst for knowledge,” one of the messages said. “I remember you always with a smile on your face. You will be missed.”
Several mentioned fond memories of talent shows in which Laramie, a guitarist and singer, had performed. Others recalled games of Bananagrams, a summer in Harvard’s BLISS research program, and Laramie’s vivid smile.
Laramie was a member of the Harvard Glee Club and Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
“Your enthusiasm and friendliness were unique,” one message read.
Another said, “I will miss your music, smiles, and laughter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst shouts, impromptu dances, and thousands of small flyers, Harvard’s hundreds of clubs spent three hours racing to collect as many new members as they could for the new school year.
 
From the fishing club to the pre-dental society to a dozen or so a cappella groups, club representatives lined the Quad at the Friday activities fair to advertise their groups in creative fashion.
 
“It’s really cool to see all this energy and how much people are in love with what they do,” said Florence Y. Chen ’15, who represented the Institute of Politics.
 
Walking down an aisle of tables, passersby were bombarded by pamphlets, candy, juice boxes and other handouts pronouncing the benefits of membership in various clubs.
 
“Freshmen are surprised,” said J. Arturo Villanueva ’13, who was representing the Texas Club. “This is the first time they get to see everything that goes on here.”
 
Many freshmen stayed for the duration of the event to take in the scope of activities at Harvard. “This is a great opportunity to do so many things that I didn’t have at home,” said Benjy S. Levin ’16.
 
The tables were grouped by theme—sports, public service, music, et cetera. Meanwhile, Harvard University Dining Services offered an outdoor buffet celebrating Boston’s diverse food offerings.
 
The onslaught of excited club promoters was overwhelming for many new freshmen. With so many activities, students said they had trouble deciding what to sign up for. “There are a lot of people and a lot of booths and they make it seem like it’s your one chance to get involved in something,” said Issac L. Alter ’16. “But it’s not. I hope it’s not.”
 
Even when freshmen knew they were not interested, they sometimes could not avoid having brochures pushed into their hands.
 
“I don’t like being forced to take flyers,” said Allyson L. Covello ’16, “but I feel bad turning them down.”
 
Other freshmen simply took what they were offered. Looking over her collection of freebies as the fair wound down, Stephanie G. Franklin ’16 realized she had received a Christian Bible. “I’m Jewish,” she said. “I didn’t know what they were handing me.”
 
Despite long lists of prospective members by the end of the fair, club leaders could not be sure all those people would ever show up at a meeting. “A ton of people just put their name down,” said Marc F. Shi ’14, who represented Health Leads. “They don’t really realize what they’re getting into.
 
The incoming freshmen expressed similar sentiments. “I’ve signed up for twenty or so things,” said Levin. “I’ll see what I can manage.”
 
But he did know that the Harvard Quidditch team was an option for him. “It sounds amazing,” said Levin. “And I hear you can tackle girls.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Taryn Kurcz’s tip in off of a free kick from Peyton Johnson found the back of the net in the 73rd minute, the Harvard women’s soccer team believed it had a shot at a come-from-behind victory.
But the Crimson, down 2-1 following Kurcz’s score, could not complete the comeback. The team allowed a goal 1:31 later, and Harvard fell to Dayton on Friday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse stadium, 3-1.
The game was delayed by an hour due to lighting in the area, and the Flyers (4-3) came out looking much sharper than Harvard in the opening minutes of the match.
Dayton had five shots in the first 10 minutes of the game, and the team scored its first goal in the 11th minute. Crimson sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten was called for a foul inside the penalty box, and the Flyers’ Colleen Williams converted on the penalty kick, firing a shot into the top left corner for her fifth goal of the season.
After escaping the initial flurry of activity down by one, Harvard eventually found its footing around the 20th minute, and the game became a much more even contest.
“I think that we definitely bounced back [from the early goal],” said Johnson, a junior co-captain. “After that, we were able to put on some hard pressure and be able to play with a lot more intensity than we had in the beginning. Unfortunately, it did take those first 20 minutes of being asleep before we stepped it up.”
Johnson was able to generate the most offensive pressure for the Crimson in the first half. The midfielder led the team with three shots on target, including the best scoring chance for Harvard of the opening period. With 17 minutes left in the half, Johnson ripped a shot from 30 yards out that was only narrowly saved by Dayton keeper Jordin Melchert, who tipped the ball over the crossbar.
Despite being outshot by the Flyers, 13-8, the Crimson had the final attempt of the first half. In the 43rd minute, sophomore forward Meg Casscells-Hamby, who led Harvard with eight shots in the game, blasted a shot that went just wide.
In the second half, the Crimson came out much more aggressively than it had in the first, firing off four shots in the first 10 minutes. But Dayton, unlike the Crimson, managed to capitalize on its opportunities early in the second frame. The Flyers’ Nicole Waters delivered a pass up the middle to Juliana Libertin, and Libertin beat Kanten, firing a shot into the left side of the net in the 55th minute.
Eighteen minutes later, the Crimson broke through. After some physical contact from Dayton, the Crimson was awarded a free kick in the Flyers’ half. Johnson played the ball on the ground into Dayton’s penalty area, and after a couple of deflections, Kurcz was able to take possession of the ball and find the back of the net. The score brought the Crimson within one of the visiting Flyers.
This was the third goal in the last two contests for Kurcz, who is a Crimson sports executive, making her the leading scorer for the Crimson.
“[Kurcz] always plays with incredible intensity,” Johnson said. “She always brings everything in practice and in games. It’s awesome for her and for us...that [her] intensity is turning into goals.”
It was also Johnson’s third assist in as many games, although the junior is quick to point to her entire team’s hard work as reason for her success.
“We’ve had a lot of commitment as a team on set pieces, which is how I’ve been able to help contribute,” Johnson said. “I think that it’s really more of a testament to the team working.”
Less than two minutes after Kurcz’s goal cut the Flyers’ lead in half, Dayton went back up by two when Stephanie Emery passed it to Nicole Walters, who netted the ball from 10 yards out.
The two-goal deficit proved too much for the Crimson to overcome, and Harvard suffered its first loss of the 2012 season.

This September, the Harvard Square Business Association is sponsoring a month-long celebration of Harvard Square's artistic and cultural heritage called "Revival Month"."Harvard Square used to be a place where people used to come together [and] play music, and it was such a wonderful celebration of folk music and tradition," said Denise Jillson, Executive Director of the HSBA.
"Cambridge continues to be a very welcoming place for musicians"  continued Jillson. Indeed, “Revival Month” is very much about the  continuity between Harvard Square’s past cultural legacy and current  artistic community. The month-long celebration is named in honor of the  newly-released novel "Revival", by Boston writer Scott Alarik. The  novel, set in modern-day Cambridge, is a romantic drama about two  struggling folk musicians. A folk artist himself, Alarik is known for  his performances on NPR and his two decades of journalistic coverage of  folk music for the Boston Globe.
Noteworthy among the performers is Bread and Puppet Theater, a  theatrical group that combines eclectic acts and instruments with biting  political satire. The group has its own strong historical heritage,  having staged mass pageants and processions during the Vietnam War. They  return to Cambridge after having launched the inaugural “Revival Month”  last year.
Upcoming highlights:
September 8th
Novelist Scott Alarik will give a free performance and read from his book “Revival” as part of Club Passim's outdoor concert series
Where: Palmer Street
When: 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM.

The parade  will include local New Orleans-style jazz bands, folk musicians, and a  variety of cultural organization based in Cambridge.

Just because we're the oldest college in the country doesn't mean we are the best. In fact, it doesn't even mean we crack the top five.
This summer, Forbes ranked Harvard as the sixth best undergraduate program in the country. Princeton topped the list, followed by Williams, Stanford, University of Chicago and (gasp) Yale. As part of the ranking, Forbes included the total cost of attending each school. Of the top six, Harvard was the second cheapest with a total cost of $56,000, while Princeton was the least expensive at $53,934. Forbes estimated Yale's costs to be significantly higher than Harvard's at $58,250, and University of Chicago was the priciest of the top six colleges with an estimated cost of $59,950. Others ranked in the top ten include the United States Military Academy, Columbia University, Pomona College, and Swarthmore College. Cornell was the lowest ranked Ivy League college, coming in at number 51, just behind University of California at Berkeley.
