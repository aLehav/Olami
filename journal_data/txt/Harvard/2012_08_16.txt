After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, singer Frank Ocean published an open letter on his tumblr in which he describes how he fell in love with a man as a teenager. The news about Ocean’s sexuality was endlessly discussed among critics and fans alike. However, this recent revelation about Ocean’s sexuality should not eclipse another revelation: Ocean’s debut album “channel ORANGE”. Through beautiful vocals, imaginative songwriting, lush arrangements, and poignant lyrical themes, Ocean’s debut astounds and probes deeply into his troubled identity.
Ocean’s upbeat R&B compositions are the most immediately memorable songs on “Channel ORANGE.” “Lost” and “Sweet Life” will rightly earn Ocean comparisons to greats like Stevie Wonder and Prince due to their otherworldly vocals and dreamy ’80s keyboards. “Pyramids”, the second single, is a tremendous display of songwriting: Ocean takes the listener on a harrowing journey from ancient Egypt to a strip club to his bedroom. Most pop music isn’t built to hold the listener’s attention for ten minutes straight, but Ocean’s melodic turns, mood shifts and flurry of synth lines make “Pyramids” an R&B epic.
The beauty of “channel ORANGE” goes far beyond individual songwriting, as Ocean crafts a cohesive, meaningful album, with each song building on the sound and themes of the preceding tracks. Over the course of the record, Ocean scatters interludes filled with the sound of rain and analog hiss between the other decidedly hi-fi songs, giving the album a lo-fi charm and intimacy that beautifully complement Ocean’s lyrical honesty.  Ocean even reigns in his three featured artists’ very distinctive artistic personas to complement his thematic direction: André 3000 lays down an uncharacteristically reserved and somber verse on “Pink Matter”, and Earl Sweatshirt uses his trademark drone to play the role of the dissatisfied youth in “Super Rich Kids”. Even Odd Future leader Tyler, the Creator, known for his use of shock and gruesome imagery, drops by to write a verse on “Golden Girl” that strays dangerously close to tender.
The album’s climax is the raw, emotionally charged “Bad Religion”. With its sparse, delicate instrumentation and barebones vocals, “Bad Religion” feels like a Polaroid photograph in an age of flash and post-processing. While dwarfed in length and technical complexity by some other tracks, “Bad Religion” is the thematic anchor and focal point of the album. Set in the middle of an album that feels like a desperate conversation in a confessional, “Bad Religion” features Ocean conscripting a taxi driver to serve as his priest for an impromptu confession. As Ocean sings, “This unrequited love / To me it’s nothing but a one-man cult / And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup / I could never make him love me,” the listener can hear his turmoil, pain, and confusion in his voice, and never once does it feel melodramatic.
If “Bad Religion” is the climax of the album, then “Forrest Gump” and “End/Golden Girl” serve as the falling action and resolution respectively. “Forrest Gump” is a sweet, simple love song that ends with happy-go-lucky whistling, far removed from the quiet introspection on display for most of the album. “End” is the final track on the album, with the pitter-patter of rain on the roof of a car and a muted conversation between Ocean and a woman.  The woman ends the conversation with, “You’re special, I wish you could see what I see.” After a long, uncomfortable silence, the bonus track “Golden Girl” begins, with more beautiful, loving statements from Ocean about the titular golden girl.
“Bad Religion” would make for a powerful and tragic end to an album fraught with emotion, but it is heartening to hear the more optimistic “Forrest Gump” and “End/Golden Girl” at the end of the album. The two final pieces play like a letter from a faraway friend saying that despite a harrowing journey, he is doing well. Throughout “channel ORANGE”, Frank Ocean elevates his personal musings and turmoil to poetry and gorgeous song, and by the end, it is nice to see him find a small piece of solace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 4:45 a.m., and I’m sitting on the steps outside the “Boulogne - Jean Jaurès” Métro station in Paris, France. My legs are covered with goosebumps the size of quarters and I’m so tired I can scarcely think. As I wait for the metal gates to open, I try desperately to tune out the sound of my own teeth chattering from the cold. What am I doing here?
There is good reason for my momentary misery. I have just attended the talent-packed Solidays, an annual Parisian festival dating back to 1999. Over the course of one evening, I have witnessed four incredible performances in one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, supplemented by great conversation and beer underneath a clear, blue sky. I suppose I have little to complain about.
Despite growing up in the northwest with its constant stream of musical events, I had never been to a music festival before. I was studying abroad in Paris this summer, attending class and living with a host family, so I had begun to feel like a local by the time I saw the advertisement dans la rue one day. On a whim, I looked up the dates and artists online, bought tickets for Friday, and convinced a friend in my class to come with me. I had little idea of what to expect; I’d not planned much further than printing out the tickets and finding directions to the venue.
We arrived at Boulogne - Jean Jaurès at around 5:30pm on Friday, and not a moment too soon. The line to enter already stretched several blocks, and that wasn’t counting the separate line for people planning to camp out for the whole weekend (which in retrospect, probably would’ve been a good idea), sleeping bags and coolers in tow. By the time we made it through security an hour later we were sweating a good deal in the evening sun.
After purchasing some falafel, we realized that it was almost time for Ben Howard to come on stage. We wolfed down our food, scampered over, and managed to find a place to stand underneath  the tent. Although he has only just released his first album, Howard, a sandy-haired, British acoustic singer-songwriter, has already exploded throughout Europe. He demonstrated his good-natured English humor through his witty banter during sound malfunctions and his energetic jams at the end of every song. I was thoroughly disappointed when his set was over, no encore.
We then caught a glimpse of Miles Kane, who looked comically foppish in a cobalt blue suit, black turtleneck and Beatles-esque mop of hair.  His poppy ballads were a bit too sugar-sweet for my taste, but he did liven up the overly serious atmosphere. Despite hippie attire and low-grade beer, these were Parisians, after all, and their bohemian vibe appeared to be more vogue than vagabond.
Then it was off to see Selah Sue, a relatively new discovery for me. The petite blonde from Belgium belted and beatboxed with a soulful, brash style reminiscent of the late Amy Winehouse. Pretty soon the crowd was bobbing their heads and swaying their shoulders along with the beat.
By now it had gotten dark (finally, at 11pm), and we trekked across the grassy field yet again to see the main draw for me: Metronomy, a band whose spring concert in Boston I had missed. They did not disappoint. Their eccentric electronic beats and falsetto vocal lines perfectly suited the blasé mood of the chain-smoking crowd, and when they asked (in shaky French) if anybody had a light, the audience became a sea of flames. Given the infectious energy and enthusiasm, their hour-long set was certainly insufficient.
We decided to stay at the same scene to get spots close to the stage for the next act, The Kills. I wasn’t too familiar with the rock duo, I didn’t need to know their cutting lyrics by heart in order to take pleasure in the sharp guitar riffs and perfect pairing of male and female voices. The duo paraded around the stage and wailed into the same microphone with youthful enthusiasm. Upon the first note of “Future Starts Show,” every living soul within earshot went wild. Everyone—French and foreign—was dancing and singing without restraint, to the point where a tiny girl in glasses was bumping forcibly along with the beat into the backs of our knees. By the time the concert ended, it was 2am, and we were reeling from sheer adrenaline. “Aren’t they just the greatest ever?” my friend gasped. Perhaps “the greatest ever” would be a stretch, but it was definitely not a bad way to finish the night.
Three hours later, I sat shivering and waiting for the Métro to open so we could finally go home—it had proved impossible to hail a taxi on the outskirts of Paris. Although I wanted nothing more than to be safe underneath the warm sheets of my bed, I couldn’t help but feel grateful to walk away with pulsating veins and the bass of several talented bands still bumping in my ears. It may have been my first concert festival, but it certainly won’t be my last.

After a three year-stint in Atlantic City, N.J., the ECAC Hockey Men’s Championship will soon return to the site of the most famous moment in U.S. hockey history.
The home of the “Miracle on Ice,” the 1980 Rink - Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., will host the championship for at least three years starting in 2014, the ECAC announced on Tuesday.
“Lake Placid has always been one of the special hockey places in the U.S.,” said ECAC Hockey Commissioner Steve Hagwell in a press release. “The combination of the warm welcome from the surrounding community, aura of the venue, and general support will be easily absorbed by fans and students alike.”
From 1993-2002, Lake Placid’s Olympic Arena played host to the championship, which currently includes the semifinal and final rounds of the ECAC playoffs. In those 10 years, the Harvard men’s hockey team captured two league titles.
The 8500-seat 1980 Rink – Herb Brooks Arena is a considerably smaller venue than Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall, which can hold 10,500 spectators for hockey games.
Boardwalk Hall will once again host the championship in 2013, when Harvard will look to capture its first league title since 2006. In the 2012 championship, the Crimson nearly completed an improbable late-season run, falling one win short of the elusive ECAC crown despite minimal expectations entering the year.
