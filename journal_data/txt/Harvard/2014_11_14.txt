Art imitates life, as life imitates art. This is especially apparent in “Three Sisters,” which runs on the Loeb Mainstage from Nov. 7 to 15. In this particular production, directed by Anna A. Hagen ’15 and co-produced by active Arts Executive Emma R. Adler ’16 and Andrew P. Gelfand ’15, renowned contemporary playwright Sarah Ruhl takes the classic Chekhov play and gives it a modern twist.
The play centers around a quartet of siblings—the three sisters Olga (Rachel A. Orol ’15), Masha (Rachel A. Gibian ’15), and Irina (Chase Sui Wonders ’18) and their brother Andrei (Matthew S. Krane ’15)—whose worlds have been turned upside-down by their father’s death and their subsequent forced relocation from Moscow. As the play progresses, the siblings struggle to develop their identities, ambitions, and relationships, all while longing to go back home, taking on ill-fated romances, and revealing troubling truths about life.
Despite the long history of “Three Sisters”—its first performance was in 1901—the play is still inherently relatable. “[“Three Sisters”] is all about people who are yearning for something or striving for something,” Hagen says. “They’re all looking for perfection, but at the same time they don’t quite realize the really good things around them, and that’s the tragedy of it.” For many, especially college students, the mixed sentiment of ambition and uncertainty may sound familiar.
Also central to “Three Sisters” is the idea of individual complexity. “It’s a weird play in that there are 10 characters, [all of whom] are incredibly detailed,” Hagen says. “It’s not like most plays, which have a couple of main characters who are really fleshed out and then a lot of flatter characters. Everybody is so rich, and the actors are doing beautiful work with that.”
To Gelfand, the play highlights an interesting—and very real—disconnect between ideology and reality. “I think it’s important to realize [that] life can either happen to you or you can make it happen,” Gelfand says. “I think the characters know this, but the extent to which they follow this is up in the air. I think there’s something real to that: that we can have values, but values don’t necessarily translate into actions.”
Nevertheless, stage manager Madison L. Taylor ’16 acknowledges the emotional progression of characters throughout the story: “It’s been really interesting to watch these characters develop and watch these levels of emotions come out and see that reflected in these [video] projections…[these] glimpses into their minds.”
Gelfand notes that despite all the individual complexity, “Three Sisters” is still at heart a collaborative project. “It’s so incredible how much of a team effort this was,” Gelfand says. “In many ways, I think that all theater is a community act. But the juggling act that goes on between the actors of this large ensemble cast is truly impressive…. You’re able to get a taste of everyone, and that’s the most satisfying thing.”
An innovative aspect of the play is its use of a video camera that characters use to document their lives. “We have characters at various points in the show speaking into a camera, and it’s then projected up [onto the wall],” Adler says. “It’s instantaneous…. It’s really cool. I think it’s a much more thought-provoking version of [the video confessionals] you see a lot in reality TV shows. I guess we’re playing with that a little.”
According to set designer Katherine B. Ingersoll ’15, the set plays an important role in creating a mood of desolation. “We wanted to create a set that would provide an expansive field for the characters to feel lost in,” Ingersoll says. “We achieved this through a white, minimalistic set, which also served to emphasize the use of live video projection. The set provides a medium through which the characters can perform for themselves or for others.”
When asked about the overarching themes of “Three Sisters,” Adler is thoughtful in her response. “You know ‘toska’? It’s this Russian word that’s despair and yearning all together, and there’s no way to truly express it in English. But [‘Three Sisters’] is toska…. Love and toska.”

“Totally Fucked” and “Mama Who Bore Me.” These are the songs of teenage angst, from a musical that made Broadway seem more modern to a millennium generation that had previously written it off: “Spring Awakening.”
But Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s current production of “Spring Awakening” is the play, not the musical many are familiar with. The play is filled with themes of isolation and repression, and the ending is far from the relatively uplifting conclusions typical of the musical. When they decided to focus on the original play, director kat baus ’15 ran into a problem. Baus couldn’t find an English translation that did the text justice.
So baus set about translating the play from German. The German text left a lot of room for interpretation for the director—there are hardly any stage directions, and many of the sensitive topics, from rape to masturbation, are represented by a mere line of dashes in the script. “Getting to play with the language, to bring [the storyline] through in a contemporary context…has been such a blast,” baus says.
They found references to Nietzsche and the Bible not present in the Broadway iteration. The presence of these influences added depth to the play for baus, allowing them to re-interpret a storyline in a way that hasn’t been readily presented on the modern stage. “You feel like adolescents are actually speaking,” producer Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16 says.
“Spring Awakening” is the 1891 story of a group of young adults struggling with their sexuality identity in a rural German town. For the HRDC production, “Spring Awakening” is set in a town in the American South, in an effort to make the play more relatable and relevant to today.
Most of the 10 actors in the cast play multiple roles—a teen and an adult. This choice is not only about efficiency but also about layering the complexity of the characters. Actor Colin A. Mark ’17, who plays Moritz, sees the play as one of the most difficult in which he’s been cast, but also one of the most rewarding. “We have been putting in place a lot of measures to make sure that the actors are able to stay safe while engaging in this kind of difficult work,” Mark says.
“Spring Awakening,” which gives voice to the contemporary adolescent experience—and just how difficult and confusing it is—will be opening at the Loeb Experimental Theater on Nov. 14.

“We’re catatonic, we’re catatonic, looking for something new,” sang …And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead members on their 2012 album “Lost Songs.” Though Trail of Dead has experimented with sound in the past, the band’s ninth and most recent album “IX,” while full of its trademark alternative rock fervor, remains largely a nod to its past.
Trail of Dead was founded in 1994 and garnered international attention with its 2002 album, “Source Tags and Codes.” Its primary members are Jason Reece and Conrad Keely, who both contribute drumming, guitar and lead vocals.
The band hinted at its new album with a online jigsaw puzzle in August 2014. Even the elaborate cover art looks back at Trail of Dead’s earlier, more colorful years; intricate and luxurious, it stands in solidarity with the Michelangelo-esque extravagance of 2005’s “Worlds Apart” and the vibrant colors of 2002’s “Source Tags and Codes”, deeply contrasting with stark black and white of 2012’s “Lost Songs”.
Nevertheless, this return to color is not all sunshine and roses; underneath the powerful riffs and shouted lyrics, “IX” touches upon very vulnerable, universal feelings. In a charged statement, Trail of Dead wrote: “This album is about loss and how we've all experienced it. We hope you can all relate. If you can't relate then you aren't human and you deserve to die.”
This thought rings true in the tracklisting, which revolves around the darker, less-discussed parts of life. “The Lie Without a Liar” references Freud’s controversial “id vs. ego vs. super-ego” theory of psychoanalysis and muses about tension and interpersonal interaction. “Jaded Apostles,” inspired by the Apostle Peter, reflects the sense of weariness in perseverance, with the singer screaming himself hoarse with frustration near the bridge. On the other hand, “The Dragonfly Queen” uses simple, rambling lyrics to ask questions about innocence and growing up; to frontman Conrad Keely, the song describes “meeting someone, having a child with them, then wondering how to explain your separation to your child once he's grown up.”
Vivid imagery is also prevalent in the lyricism. “The Ghost Within” uses a quiet chord sequence that repeats like an ocean wave to parallel the difficulty of ending a relationship, evoking the cycle of letting go and coming back. The singer shouts: “And you try to run / but you can’t…. And [the ghost] wants you to let go / and it wants you to come home.” And “Bus Lines,” inspired by the wearying experience of taking the bus in Southeast Asia, elicits the quick blur of the window-seat view with a continuous flow of detailed lyrics: “Realize what you’ve done / listen to a different song / clash to a different drum.” The lyrics eventually are driven by a statement—“feels like something’s taking over”—that evokes the hazy experience of a long car ride.
Also prominent in “IX” is the inclusion of sounds not traditionally used in rock music. Seafaring-inspired “A Million Random Digits” plays into this with its inclusion of a plaintive flute sound, while “Lost in the Grand Scheme” starts with white noise and escalates into a two-minute-long instrumental. “The Doomsday Book” erupts with a rousing intro that recalls crusading into battle. Notably, “Sound of the Silk” transports the listener to the iconic silk markets of Phnom Penh, layering voices and the clack of silk looms into the drum ensemble.
The album’s layering of sound makes for a rich aural experience. “How to Avoid Huge Ships,” loosely inspired by Ender’s Game, is a post-rock instrumental track that, stuck in the middle of the album, makes you appreciate Trail of Dead’s musical talent. It starts off as a simple finger exercise for the guitar that becomes progressively more complex and layered, eventually building into a swelling wave of sound. Likewise, “Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears” begins with a standard chord progression that quickly spirals into surprise dissonance, blending piano intervals with a rubato violin line and a thundering drum that ultimately drive the whole song. It’s done in a way that can only be described as epic.
Though “IX” has its foundations in a steady drumbeat and a strong guitar baseline, these elements sometimes overpower the vocals. This poses a problem—it’s difficult to sing along and fully experience the music if you can’t hear the lyrics. In the long run, the persistent overpowering of the vocals results in an overall atmosphere of vaguely confused excitement. Recognizing one’s roots is often a good thing, but “IX” almost begs for variety. Listening through the album thrusts you into an environment that is constantly thrumming and alive, but exhausting: by the seventh track you might be thinking, “Slow down! Let me savor this.” Nevertheless, while “IX” may leave listeners wanting more, Trail of Dead’s return to its progressive alternative-rock origins sets the stage for more growth and musical development to come.

Following a recent disclosure, the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted to creating a bogus Associated Press news article designed to trick a 15-year-old bomb threat suspect in Washington state into downloading tracking software onto his computer. The agent posted the link on the suspect’s MySpace page in 2007; when he opened the fake link, the malware was installed. F.B.I. director James Comey wrote in a letter to The New York Times that the agent “portrayed himself as an employee of The Associated Press,” asking the suspect to fact-check a draft of the article in order to cause him to open the link.
The F.B.I. has defended its actions by stating that its tactics conformed to internal and Justice Department guidelines. Kathleen Carroll, executive editor of the AP, took the opposite stance, decrying the actions as “unacceptable.” Carroll is right: these developments suggest a dangerous infringement on freedom of press, and must not be repeated.
The F.B.I.’s actions are concerning for their blatant disregard for the fundamental role that the press should play in a democracy. These antics undermine journalistic integrity: in a country where federal agents are free to impersonate journalists, sources have no reason to trust that any journalist they meet is not actually a federal agent. Such a strain on the relationship between reporters and sources would make good reporting nearly impossible, weakening journalism’s ability to create a properly informed populace and keep institutions—such as the F.B.I.—in check.
The F.B.I.’s recent actions are part of a larger trend that has seen the reporter-source relationship placed in increasing jeopardy. This trend is exemplified by cases like that of James Risen, a New York Times reporter facing jail time for refusing to name a confidential source, reveal. This trend is highly disturbing and should not continue.
Sting operations may demand the use of deceptive tactics, but the impersonation of journalists is especially egregious.  The freedom of the press relies on a sharp line between journalism and government, and cannot exist when that line is blurred. Even if the end of the F.B.I.’s actions here was a good one, the means could easily be used toward less beneficent goals. The prospect of a society in which the government may freely impersonate journalists—and thus control the flow of information to citizens—is a dangerous one.
Journalistic institutions in this country should be treated with greater respect, not as pawns in a game of cat and mouse between law enforcement agencies and suspects. As the AP has requested, the F.B.I. should release new guidelines guaranteeing that actions like these will not continue. It is imperative that we advocate for the protection of the freedom of the press in any case such as this one—independent and credible journalism is vital to our welfare, and deserves such protections.

The vast majority of Harvard students will graduate without having a nervous breakdown or attempting suicide. Very few of us will become so violently ill that we won’t be able to make it through the night. Only a handful of us will drink enough alcohol or do enough drugs to put our lives in danger. Of the students who seek refuge in Stillman Infirmary, the vast majority could objectively have spent the night at home and waited until the following morning for their concerns to be addressed.
In the eyes of University Health Services Director Paul Barreira, these facts are reason enough to merit a restructuring. In an email sent out early Thursday morning, Barreira outlined plans to replace the Infirmary, which provides in-person urgent care and overnight services from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. every night, with a telephone triage system. By directing the few students who truly need urgent care to other resources, including nearby Mt. Auburn Hospital, Barreira hopes to make more services available during the day.
What Barreira and HUHS fail to understand is that Stillman provides a vital presence on campus precisely because it is a place where objective standards are not the primary determinant of care. A student who decides to spend the night at Stillman does not have to prove they are sick enough, or depressed enough, or intoxicated enough to merit attention. It is one of very few places where simply reaching out for help is a guarantee that help will be provided.
Despite attending the world’s wealthiest college, Harvard students often operate in an environment of scarcity. When we choose classes, we are well aware that many of the most popular options will have a lottery or application for entry. When we join selective student organizations, we often endure a probationary period in which we are reminded that student interest exceeds the number of positions available.
The ethic of limited resources also permeates most of our care and support resources— most of the advisors the college assigns us have their own administrative or academic burdens to bear. Before seeking help, Harvard students often calculate their own worthiness, the burden they will be imposing, along with any potential harm to future relationships. Help is a commodity that carries with it a social cost. Seeking help too often may cost their reputation and even hinder their ability to find help in the future.
For better or for worse, Stillman Infirmary is one of few places on campus where a student’s perceived need is the only prerequisite for receiving help. Replacing Stillman with a triage system would destroy a vital and unique resource for student self-care, and perpetuate a culture where students are incentivized to constantly measure themselves against external standards.
Adding a triage call to the process of seeking help after hours seems beneficial from a purely logical perspective. Ideally, students with borderline symptoms would either be reassured that they could make it through the night at home or they would be transported to Mt. Auburn hospital for necessary care.
However, the very process of describing one’s symptoms over the phone is itself a deterrent to seeking care and can be deeply invalidating, especially in cases of mental health concerns. Students who seek mental health resources afterhours already struggle with social stigma that prevents access to care—including the idea that one should simply “get over” mental illness, or that mental illness concerns are not “real.” Telephone triage adds yet another level of self-doubt to the process.
The phone triage system currently in use at Counseling and Mental Health Services already receives considerable negative feedback from students. In a 2012 interview with The Crimson, Sophia V. Ohler ’15 reported being told she should visit the Bureau of Study Council because she “sounded fine” over the phone. A commenter on the same post described “baring her soul” to someone she couldn’t even see face to face as a humiliating process.
Under the current system, these students are at least afforded the possibility of speaking with a care provider face to face, and provided a safe place to stay for the night. For some students, having this option could mean the difference between reaching out for help, and choosing to endure their problems alone— a choice that could have serious negative consequences in the long run.
HUHS must recognize that the quality of a healthcare system depends on more than the number of visitors it serves, the speed in which it serves them, or even its rate of correct diagnosis. Strong healthcare systems are based, above all, on the relationships between patients and their caregivers. To improve campus healthcare, HUHS should focus on fostering an atmosphere based on trust, not triage.

The biggest news coming out of the 2014 midterm election has nothing to do with the actual results at the polls or the bigger questions about What It All Means. The numbers tell the story: The turnout for these midterm elections was the worst in 72 years. For those who can do both math and history, that was right in the middle of World War II.
I am one of the many who bypassed this civic duty. And I don't pretend like I'm some brave pariah for claiming this— because chances are that most people reading this are fellow members of the non-voting majority.
This is a strange column for me to write. Coming into Harvard, I was convinced that I would go into politics. But that didn't last long. My freshman advisor, upon hearing of my mid-freshman year political disillusionment crisis, simply chuckled as he acknowledged the long, proud tradition of politically ambitious students falling by the wayside in pursuit of more esoteric academic interests. After all, he had been one of them. But he probably would not have expected me to have gotten to this point.
I am aware of countless calls to exercise my "civic duty." I did not disregard these calls because I thought that the rest of my life was more important. It wasn't a matter of will. I did not vote because I couldn't bring myself to care enough about the results.
To hear pundits say it, this indifference will bring the inevitable downfall of our nation.
Is not voting an unpardonable transgression in modern-day American politics? Is it somehow spitting in the face of the sacrifice of countless men and women who died to ensure that we have this fundamental right? If this is indeed the case, then I am of all people to be most despised.
But this false appeal to nationalism that somehow compels us to vote is thoroughly misguided. Yes, my right to vote is, in an abstract sense, a result of people making sure that this nation became and stayed free. But voting is simply a sign of something greater: An unfaltering optimism that we can take the necessary steps to ensure that this remains the land of equal opportunity.
It is not a far-fetched statement to say that the current political environment is not accomplishing this explicit goal. At this point, exercising the right to vote is about making  statement, even if no tangible change will come out of it. Once we make politics about statements, however, we are undercutting its very purpose. The purpose of politics is making people's lives better—not standing behind some grandiose, oftentimes abstract idea. It's interesting to me that we despise politicians who go to Washington simply to make a statement. But these politicians are the ones fulfilling the wishes of the general populace.
Does this mean that I do not want to make the world a better place? Of course not. What it means, though, is that putting my hope on a select group of people and hoping that they continue to make this a land of free opportunity is, not for lack of a better term, lazy.
People who want to see the world changed will not be stopped when the candidate who most closely espouses their ideas get elected. And heaven forbid that people become complacent when the candidate with whom they do agree is elected. Government is meant to simply be another avenue through which change happens. And when it doesn't accomplish that, we have every right to hand back the ticket and say that we will make, regardless of who's in office.
My failure to vote is not a statement. It is a clear step towards a better America—one that doesn't rely on who sits behind the mahogany desk with the name tag on which my current geographic location is imprinted, but on groups and communities who ignore the political gridlock, become indifferent to whether a donkey or an elephant controls the Senate, and make tangible changes to the world around them. You don't need the approval or support of bureaucrats to do that.

Psychological abuse is the ultraviolet of the violence spectrum. The bruises on women’s psyche are invisible. Physical violence means physical damage, and that tarnishes beauty. Psychological abuse doesn’t—it’s convenient that way. The female function of sex appeal remains unscathed and evidence of the crime is hidden to boot. Really, it’s a win-win for the bad guys (and yes, I use “guys” purposefully).
Because my mum is the coolest, I like to follow in her footsteps. She’s fairly outspoken, and I try to be the same. She volunteers her time with female survivors of domestic violence, and I do the same. A recurring concern among the women I’ve met is that their abuse was not serious enough to warrant an intervention. There was the sense that psychological abuse, while degrading, did not “count”—as if what measured the severity of abuse was something quantifiable (perhaps the number of bruises, or of hospital visits).
Then again, I can hardly blame these women—and they were overwhelmingly women—for thinking such. It was only two years ago that the FBI acknowledged that rape could occur without physical force, thus modifying the federal definition of rape that had remained unchanged since 1927. Fun fact for the sake of intersectionality: the ’27 definition only accounted for the “the carnal knowledge of a female.” Sorry male or trans survivors! No justice for you!
Physical abuse is horrific, but it is only one narrative among many. Instead of focusing solely on the most physically shocking examples of abuse, we must include multiple narratives for the term. Failing to do so means marginalizing hundreds who require help. It’s not one-narrative-fits-all.
Survivors of partner violence are a diverse group, and the challenges they face are equally disparate. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of survivors in America of every creed and color. At the same time, there are certain cultural barriers that make it harder for women in certain demographics to achieve justice.
Along with me, the Violence Against Women Act turned twenty this fall. Under VAWA, survivors of abuse can self-sponsor when they apply for citizenship. The act, however, only provides that exemption to victims of “battery”—in other words, just for victims of physical abuse. Survivors of psychological abuse are conspicuously absent from VAWA’s text, just like they are conspicuously absent from justice.
VAWA’s loophole is especially concerning because immigrant women often live in situations that facilitate domestic abuse. A report by the Family Violence Prevention Fund listed some predictable reasons why this would be the case: Immigrant women may face a language barrier, can be easily isolated from the rest of society, and often live in insular communities where their every move can be monitored. None of these factors cause the abuse, but they make finding help that much harder.
Japan—my home—is just as much a danger zone. Speaking with Noriko Mizuno, a family law professor from Tohoku University, I learned that police often do nothing to protect victims of partner abuse. Rather, victims are expected to take matters—quietly—into their own hands. She cited an example of a woman who went to the police, only to be told that she should just leave her husband, thereby risking her financial stability. One of the (unfortunately true) stereotypes of Japan is that the appearance of familial unity is paramount—even if it means risking a woman’s life.
I don’t mean to suggest that certain cultural traditions intrinsically condone violence against women. They do not. “Diversity” can get thrown around a lot as a rationale not to intrude on abusive practices (“We can’t criticize circumcision and genital mutilation—it’s their culture”). This dismissal itself stinks of racism—either that or ignorance. A psychiatrist once suggested to my friend that it was normal for her father to batter her mother, because her family is Muslim. Racism or ignorance? I imagine it takes a great deal of one or the other to define a culture as fundamentally violent.
Chalking the issue up to a natural consequence of Muslim or Asian culture does absolutely nothing to help victims of abuse, while also furthering stigma against large swaths of the globe. But ignoring differences completely is a stupid thing to do, and ultimately throws women under the bus.
Unlike the current Chief Justice, I don't think that glossing over these differences is the way to further equality. Race matters; culture matters; background matters. Along with special vulnerability comes the need for special protections.

UPDATED: November 14, 2014, at 2:05 a.m.
Harvard Medical School is halfway toward its goal of raising $750 million in its piece of the ongoing University-wide capital campaign, the school announced Thursday afternoon. The announcement preceded a kickoff event Thursday evening at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel that drew more than 250 alumni, administrators, and HMS affiliates and featured speeches from top-level administrators and a performance by Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
The school’s goal represents about 12 percent of Harvard’s total campaign goal and is the third highest among the University's schools, following those of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Business School. HMS is one of the last schools to join the University-wide campaign, which launched in Sept. 2013, and the school has already raised $375 million through gifts and pledges from nearly 5,300 donors and alumni.
The campaign’s four priorities include better educating students and increasing student financial aid; understanding and curing disease by supporting biomedical informatics, therapeutic science, and other fields; improving health systems through increased focus on global health, health care systems, and primary care; and providing flexible funding for health research and change.
At the launch event, Dean of the Medical School Jeffrey S. Flier cited obesity as an example of a complex health problem that, despite growing insights and knowledge on the topic, demands funding from donors for further research.
“We’re missing another part of the puzzle,” he said. “We need to continue our efforts to understand, and we need to be patient because we do not always succeed right away.”
Similarly, University President Drew G. Faust underscored the role of donor support to the success of the Medical School.
“The achievements of Harvard Medical School are not accidents of history. They are the product of centuries of cumulative efforts of support and generosity,” she said.
Joshua S. Boger, founder and former CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals and a member of the HMS Board of Fellows, will serve as chair of the campaign, which is entitled “The World is Waiting.”
The campaign’s honorary co-chair, Ellen R. Gordon, invoked this sense of urgency when explaining her decision to donate to the Medical School.
“Disease and sickness do not rest. The answers are waiting to be found,” said Gordon, who is president of Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.
“There is so much we could do. There is so much we must do,” said honorary co-chair Jack M. Connors Jr., a founding partner of advertising agency Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, Inc., during the event’s closing remarks.

UPDATED: November 14, 2014, at 1:15 a.m.
Amidst a storm of criticism surrounding recent changes to the benefit plans Harvard offers to non-union employees, University President Drew G. Faust wrote Thursday night that Harvard will keep the controversial changes in place for 2015 but will also establish a fund to mitigate cost increases for some employees and explore alternative plan designs for the future.
“It is clear...that the 2015 health benefits options are causing distress among some members of our community,” Faust wrote in a letter to faculty and staff, explaining that the enrollment period for the plans has already begun. “It is not feasible to alter these plans for 2015 as they are negotiated with vendors over a period of many months, and we are already into the enrollment period for the new plans.  I hope, however, that we can mitigate some of the current anxiety as we simultaneously assess the impact of these changes in the year ahead.”
Following a round of tense back-and-forth between administrators and faculty members at last Tuesday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the body unanimously voted to request that Faust and members of the Harvard Corporation reverse changes to the University’s health benefits policy for non-union employees, including faculty members.
Responding to that vote, as she said she would after last week’s meeting, Faust enumerated four points of action. She wrote that Harvard will establish a fund that will support affected faculty and staff who see their costs, excluding premiums, exceed 3 percent of their salary. Faust said that more specifics on that fund will be released soon.
Faust also said that the University Benefits Committee, which recommended the controversial changes, would explore the possibility of introducing more specialized plans that might cut costs to the insured by offering a narrower care network.
Additionally, Faust wrote  that the UBC is preparing to host several town hall meetings in the coming weeks about the changes and the work ahead. She said that she and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 have asked the committee to closely monitor the progress of the new plans and provide an interim report by the end of June 2015.
Faust also noted that the Harvard Corporation, which has stayed publicly silent on the new policy and criticisms of it, has considered and fully supports the new plans.
“The Fellows...have affirmed their confidence and support regarding the judgment of the UBC and the administration in seeking both to address the escalating costs of health benefits as a significant driver of university expenses and to ensure our faculty and staff’s continued access to strong benefits and excellent care,” she wrote.
In the letter, Faust also addressed some of the criticism  voiced by FAS faculty members in the past several weeks, specifically on the rising cost of health care and comparisons of the policy with that of Harvard’s peers.
“There are many different ways of measuring health care costs at Harvard, but careful analysis of any of these statistics points to the same conclusion: Harvard’s health benefits costs have increased significantly and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future,” Faust wrote.
The health cost statistics initially used by University officials to back the changes came under fire last month  for misrepresenting the pace of the increase. In her letter, Faust cited that the compound annual growth rate for active and early retiree health benefits was almost twice as much as that of the University’s operating revenue. In addition, she pointed to a $55 million deficit for FAS, though the University as a whole—to which this policy applies—reported a small surplus of $2.7 million for Fiscal year 2014.
Faust also commented on the new policy in relation to those of Harvard’s peers in response to a common criticism by professors that other institutions have superior plans.
Noting how difficult it is to compare complicated benefits packages, Faust wrote that on a range of factors, “Harvard’s 2015 health plans do compare well with those presented by our peers in 2014, and they reflect the traditional desire of our community, located in the midst of some of the most outstanding physicians and hospitals in the world, to retain access to a wide range of providers and facilities.”
Leading faculty critics of the changes called the measures laid out by Faust a small improvement, but reiterated the need to a full reversal of the policy.
“President Faust’s letter is a welcome first step toward revising the university's health benefits proposal,” said History professor Mary D. Lewis, who filed the motion requesting a reversal of the benefits changes at last week’s Faculty meeting, in prepared remarks Thursday. “We would like to see the adjustments the President mentioned go much further toward protecting vulnerable faculty and staff for the upcoming year.”
Lewis added that, “Like the closure of Stillman Infirmary, the proposal may lower Harvard's own healthcare bill, but it won't lower aggregate healthcare costs for the larger Harvard community.”
Sociology professor Mary C. Waters, who along with Lewis and nine other faculty members penned an op-ed denouncing the benefits package, wrote in an email that “response from President Faust is very disappointing.”
“She says they will try to limit the costs of the deductible and co-insurance to 3% of income,” she wrote. “That’s better than nothing but it is a band aid on a hemorrhage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 14, 2014, at 5:20 p.m.
Reacting to a recent agreement jointly declared by the U.S. and China to reduce carbon emissions, Harvard faculty members said they are optimistic about collaboration between the two countries, but caution that it is difficult to predict the outcomes of the agreement.
At a conference in Beijing earlier this week, President Obama declared new U.S. targets for carbon emissions reductions while President Xi Jinping publicized China’s first commitment to halt the growth of its carbon emissions by 2030.
Several Harvard faculty members said the announcement signifies the first step for international cooperation to combat climate change.
“It is symbolic that the U.S. and China are working together to reduce pollution,” said Economics professor Dale W. Jorgenson. “I think the agreement is very important because it was announced in a prominent setting.”
William C. Kirby, a historian of China in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said the agreement requires the two countries to set aside areas of disagreement in favor of cooperation to implement the policies.
Some faculty members, however, said that it is currently difficult to predict the effectiveness of this agreement in curbing carbon emissions due to its non-binding nature.
Dwight H. Perkins, professor of political economy at the Kennedy School of Government, said the success of the U.S.-China agreement depends on whether both countries will take concrete steps to implement it.
“Will the Chinese be able to keep these targets? Can they implement what they say they will implement?” Perkins asked.
While the announcement does not oblige the countries to implement specific cutbacks, postdoctoral fellow at the Kennedy School Kyle A. Jaros said that the willingness of the U.S. and China to prioritize climate change opens a window of opportunity for international cooperation to reduce pollution.
Several professors also said the agreement could have a positive influence on international cooperation.
For Jeffrey A. Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at the Kennedy School, one of the most important aspects of the agreement is the significance of the decision in catalyzing global movement on reducing carbon emission.
“It was hard to expect other countries of the world to [join] if the U.S. and China were not participating in [taking steps against climate change] in a meaningful way,” Frankel said. “But now we have the big three [involved]—the European Union, U.S., and China—so I think it breeds a lot of much needed new life into ongoing negotiations.”
Robert N. Stavins, professor of business and government at the Kennedy School, agreed.
“This places pressure on the other larger emerging economies to join together with the countries of the industrialized world to take action,” Stavins said.
If this pressure is effective, according to Stavins, eventually countries accounting for 80 to 90 percent of global emissions could be included with additional commitments, including Brazil, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, and Indonesia.
Kennedy School and Physics professor David W. Keith, said he hopes to see more contingent commitments between countries as well.
“For example, the U.S. could say, ‘We will commit to cut an additional 5 percent if China can put in place policies that will see its emissions peak before 2025.’ I think those contingent commitments are potentially much more powerful,” Keith said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 14, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly paraphrased Robert N. Stavins in talking about the impact additional countries making emissions commitments could have. In fact, Stavins said that eventually countries accounting for 80 to 90 percent of global emissions could be included among those making commitments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down an unassuming brick walkway off Brattle St., the glow of a red and green neon sign illuminates a simple glass facade. Inside—dimly lit, painted in natural tones, and covered in wood paneling—the restaurant feels worlds away from the bustle of Harvard Square.
Its tucked-away location belies the central role Harvest has played in the birth of New American cuisine since its founding in 1974. Before farmers markets and community gardens came in vogue, Harvest offered diners inventive fare made with ingredients local to New England.
Cozied up near one of the functioning fireplaces, parked in one of the bar’s red leather banquettes, or seated in the leafy patio out back during warmer months, patrons enjoy signature entrees like coffee roasted axis venison, free range guinea hen roulade, and pumpkin agnolotti. Other menu staples include the seafood raw bar and bread basket—filled with corn and Irish soda bread.
Though the restaurant has seen its ups and downs, current Executive Chef Mary Dumont has committed herself to honoring Harvest’s four-decade tradition of innovation. The menu changes with the seasons, and even longtime staples are constantly updated.
Indeed, 40 years in, Harvest is still pushing culinary boundaries and bringing people closer to the source of their food, restaurateurs and industry experts say. Establishments in Harvard Square and throughout the U.S. look to Harvest as a leader in the local food movement. In the words of Dumont, “Harvest was farm-to-table before that was even a term.”
A MOVEMENT’S FIRST COURSE 
Though ubiquitous in today’s dining scene, the local food movement was novel at the time of Harvest’s founding. Other than Alice Water’s renowned Berkeley, Calif. restaurant, Chez Panisse, which was founded a few years earlier in 1971, Harvest represented an untested idea.
Original owners Ben and Jane Thompson shared a love of food and a desire to promote a different vision from the dominant hotel restaurant model of the time. The couple aimed to create the restaurant as they would have thrown a dinner party, current owner K. Christopher Himmel said.
“It was very forward thinking about things that we probably take for granted in restaurants today like heavy seasonality of menus, utilizing an herb garden, trying to work with more exotic meats,” Himmel said. “There really wasn’t an American restaurant...and the Harvest [was] really at the forefront of solidifying a whole different cuisine which is considered to be American cuisine today.”
According to Yale history professor Paul Freedman, who specializes in the history of cuisine, emphasizing seasonality and locality, farm-to-table cuisine was revolutionary in its noncompliance with traditional trends, which prioritized exotic foods.
“It seems so self-evident now, but we forget there was ever another definition of elegant food. Harvest is a big contributor to that, showing what wonderful things you can get if you pay attention to these local and seasonal qualities,” Freedman said.
During its early years, culinary legend Julia Child, a close friend of the Thompsons, frequently patronized Harvest, even celebrating her 90th birthday at the restaurant.
Despite celebrity endorsements from Child and others, the Thompsons' ownership ended in the mid-1980s, and the restaurant slid into decline, according to Himmel. When he took over the restaurant in 1998, Himmel said he was bent on returning Harvest to its founding principles and restoring its chef-focused cuisine.
“If you look at where we are today, it’s a renaissance of what went on in the 1970s up to the mid ’80s,” Himmel said. “We really made a decision when we had [Chef Dumont] join in 2007 to really focus on bringing the Harvest back to what it was and take it to another level.”
FROM FARM TO CAMBRIDGE’S TABLES
As Harvest transitioned back to its roots, its excellence in food innovation began to draw the attention of others in the increasingly dynamic, tight-knit Cambridge restaurant community, for which fresh, local ingredients have become the norm.
Chef Jody Adams, a James Beard Award-winning chef and creator of Rialto, located in the Charles Complex, is connected to Harvest by both business and blood. Not only did her husband work at Harvest as a server in his 20s, but she also credits the restaurant with helping to start a national movement that has paved the way for her own restaurant, offering Italian cuisine made with local ingredients.
“There is a restaurant that predates Rialto in terms of farm-to-table and that’s the Harvest,” Adams said. “It’s exciting now to see just how vibrant and relevant the whole notion of working with farms is.”
Alden & Harlow, winner of Boston Magazine’s best new restaurant of 2014 award, is close in proximity to Harvest, and there is also strong camaraderie between the two restaurants, according to Chef Michael Scelfo.
“They are without a doubt our closest friends,” Scelfo said. “I think when any restaurant has been open that long you have to take a step back...in this little pocket [of Harvard Square] there’s some legendary places in the Boston restaurant scene.”
Scelfo noted the prominence of the local food movement in the restaurant industry, though he said the expression farm-to-table has gone from its radical origins to being overused.
“I try and stay away from that expression these days,” Scelfo said. “I think that the term has become more of [public relations] hook. We are by definition farm-to-table...we just consider it smart sourcing, the way we order food.”
Chef Peter Davis of Henrietta’s Table said his restaurant and Harvest are also friendly, and credited Harvest with evolving throughout its multiple ownership changes.
“I’m happy for the Harvest and their anniversary, we’ve always been friends,” Davis said. “We’re all creating a better food system.”
With an uptick in restaurant quality, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association Denise A. Jillson says Harvard Square has become a dining destination in recent years. She said that Google analytic reports show that when most people search for Harvard Square, they are typically looking for restaurants. In this competitive environment, farm-to-table eateries have prospered.
“These restaurants all want the freshest possible food to serve to the dining public. It’s a very competitive industry and you survive for 20 or 40 years the way Harvest has—not only survived but thrived—by having the freshest food,” Jillson said.
William Gilson, chef of Inman Square restaurant Puritan & Company, credited Cambridge’s unique intellectual environment in the success of the revolutionary farm-to-table movement.
“It’s the fact that two of the best schools in the country if not the world are on either end of the street that we’re on,” Gilson said. “With Harvard and MIT, we get to be exposed to different cultures that appreciate what we do here, and that’s one of the things that makes it possible.”
BRATTLE ST. AND BEYOND
Since Himmel and his ownership group took over Harvest in 1998, the restaurant has gone through two renovations, with a third planned for Jan. 2015. Along with a revamped bar menu, Harvest has continued to evolve, adding service on Thanksgiving Day and business lunch, among other changes.
Harvest has continued to attract a celebrity clientele—including Neil Patrick Harris, Justin Timberlake, and John Malkovich as patrons of the restaurant over the years. A scene at Harvest was even featured in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs.
“We give people a lot of privacy and they’ve really enjoyed themselves,” Dumont said. “Our celebrities are actually leaders of the world.... The Secret Service is actually kind of a regular presence here.”
Though tucked away in Harvard Square, Harvest enjoys the constant influx of prospective students, tourists, and visiting dignitaries. According to Freedman, these patrons foster an open-minded environment, one that is especially receptive to the innovative approaches of these restaurants.
“How many restaurants can you say are on the way to nowhere.... I think that plays into part of the appeal of it, you have to seek the restaurant out,” Himmel said
Dumont, who was recently made a partner at Harvest, has not stopped pushing boundaries beyond the walls of the restaurant. With an interest in food policy and the local community, Dumont and Harvest have worked with numerous youth groups including “Future Chefs,” which teaches urban children skills for work in the restaurant industry. Dumont has hired several graduates of the program.
“We try to look at the restaurant from a big picture.... It does affect the food world certainly and the things that I look forward to in the future are really working with organizations that give back and give back to the community and give back to Harvard Square,” Dumont said. “People look up to this restaurant [so] really just walking the walk.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The use of antiretroviral drugs—used to halt the progression of HIV—during pregnancy does not appear to predispose infants to birth defects, contrary to popular belief about the harmful effects of the medications, a School of Public Health study found.
According to Paige L. Williams, senior lecturer on biostatistics at the School of Public Health who piloted the research team, pregnant women infected with HIV are recommended to take HIV drugs. Though such medications have proven largely safe to use, particular types have been associated with increased rates of birth defects, Williams said.
The recent study examined the incidence of negative health effects in infants whose mothers used antiretrovirals and was designed to help doctors assemble the safest combination of HIV drugs by indicating which are associated with the least risk.
With more than 3,000 HIV-infected mothers and their children enrolled in the ongoing study taking place at multiple institutions, the drugs have so far proved to be largely benign in terms of birth defects, Williams said.
“The findings from this study are generally reassuring, and suggest that most antiretrovirals are unlikely to cause an excess in congenital abnormalities when used in the first trimester,” said Roger L. Shapiro, associate professor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health.
Despite these initial results, Shapiro expressed concern over the onsent of birth defects in infants in later years, which could correspond to mothers’ use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy.
According to Shapiro, more data must be gathered to determine whether Atazanavir, a drug recommended by U.S. guidelines for pregnant HIV-positive women, actually causes harmful effects on infants in the later years. Another agent of concern is Efavirenz, which has been previously linked to neural tube defects.
“The high overall prevalence of congenital abnormalities in this study, especially in later years, is of some concern,” he said. “Further studies will be needed to monitor for increasing prevalence over time.”
Williams attributed the motivation for this study to Lynn. M. Mofenson of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
“She felt very strongly that we have an ethical mandate to ensure that mothers have safe drugs,” Williams said.

Scholars from across the U.S. and the U.K. came together to discuss the origins of and the international response that followed the crisis in Ukraine at the Center for European Studies Thursday.
Panelists first explained the initial conditions under former Ukrainian President Viktor F. Yanukovych’s rule that left Ukraine susceptible to Russia’s influence.
“While Yanukovych’s authoritarian regime was strong by Ukrainian standards it was weak by global standards,” said Lucan A. Way, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto.
Way continued that characteristics of Yanukovych’s regime led it to be inherently weak and susceptible to instability.
Way explained that the “incredibly brittle character of the Yanukovych authoritarian regime” was one of the major factors that led to the regime’s downfall. While the regime was unwilling to compromise, it was also not strong enough to effectively suppress mobilization, he said.
The regime’s weak response to popular protest was initially characterized as moderate, with some low-level violence, but not a lot of large-scale public repression, Way said.
When Yanukovych engaged in more widespread repression in the form of sniper attacks in February of this year, killing 100 Ukrainian citizens, the regime immediately collapsed, and the state itself disintegrated, opening the way for war, the panelists explained.
Having discussed the origins of the war, the panel then moved on to an extensive question and answer period, during which the scholars fielded questions from the audience of around 30 people. Many of the questions focused on the power dynamic between Russia and the West. The panelists responses were generally critical of the responses of international stakeholders.
The panelists first noted Russia’s role in escalating regional tensions.
“There is a villain in this story, and Putin is the villain,” Way said. “This crisis began in Ukraine, but the discussion has moved almost entirely to Russia.”
Paul J. D’Anieri, provost and executive vice chancellor of the University of California at Riverside, said that Putin seemed to reject the usage of factual statements in his diplomatic and domestic action.
“It’s scary stuff,” D’Anieri said.
Some panelists directed criticism towards the West as well.
“On the one hand it is easy to point to Russia as the villain, but the story is more complicated. The West is part of the build-up to the conflict,” said Gwendolyn Sasse, professor of comparative politics at Oxford University.
The U.S. had established a poor precedence for respect of international law through its campaigns in Iraq and Syria, while a lack of Western humanitarian aid for Ukraine was also an issue, D’Anieri and Sasse said respectively.
Despite these shortcomings, attendees remained optimistic about the future.
“I see there is a way out. There is still room for at least frozen conflict, if it’s not peace,” said Luise Druke, a former visiting scholar at the Harvard Law School’s Institute for Global Law and Policy.

Four undergraduates from Hawaii took Harvard’s first systematically administered Hawaiian language placement test in October, and have the possibility to fulfill their foreign language requirement with Hawaiian for the first time since 1984.
The reinstatement of the test was the result of efforts of several Hawaiian-speaking students over the last three years. These students said they consider the language as part of their cultural heritage, and feel it should be recognized by the University as a foreign language.
These efforts were first initiated by LeShae Henderson ’16, who began asking administrators about the possibility of using Hawaiian to fulfill her foreign language requirement during her freshman year. Administrators cited the lack of a qualified examiner as the reason for not being able to offer a placement test, according to Henderson.
She then petitioned the Administrative Board to have her language requirement pushed back one year, and started taking French to fulfill it.
Henderson said she found her interactions with administrators “frustrating.”
“I think it’s really symptomatic of a larger problem at Harvard,” she said. “Harvard isn't as accommodating as we think it is in terms of what you want to study, especially in terms of anything in the Pacific—unless it’s Asia—there’s not really anything offered here.”
Kaipo T. Matsumoto ’17, another Hawaiian student who advocated for the placement test, said that its offering would benefit all Hawaiian-speaking students in the future.
“It’s about legitimizing the language in general after all the historical oppression of the language…. It’s about all indigenous people at Harvard,” said Matsumoto, who is a member of the Harvard University Native American Program.
Matsumoto estimated that there are eight current undergraduates who can understand Hawaiian, and three who are fluent.
Henderson and Matsumoto received support from Maria Polinsky, a linguistics professor and chair of the Foreign Language Advisory Group, who answered affirmatively when consulted by administrators about whether the placement test should be offered.
“There’s always an important challenge to consider. Harvard cannot teach every possible language,” Polinsky said. “One of the guidelines that we use in deciding which languages can be taught is whether or not it’s associated with a literary tradition…. Hawaiian has a significant literary tradition.”
According to Polinsky, the language is undergoing a revival. She estimated that 10 percent of Hawaii’s next generation will be fluent.
When administrators could not find a Hawaiian-speaking Harvard affiliate to administer the test, the task was outsourced to a professor of Hawaiian at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The verbal component was conducted through a video conference call, marking the first time that a language placement exam has been offered remotely, according to Polinsky.
The first student in the University’s history to fulfill the foreign language requirement with Hawaiian was David M. Forman ’88, in 1984, albeit without a systemically administered test. Last October, Forman wrote a letter to then Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Education Katherine Stanton, calling the administration to offer the Hawaiian language placement test once again.
Matsumoto said he and other students who took the test are fairly confident that they would pass and successfully fulfill their foreign language requirement.
“It took a long time, but we got there,” Henderson said.

Three days before the long-awaited opening of the Harvard Art Museums, Malcolm Rogers, director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, emphasized the importance of adaptation and accessibility for the continued relevance of art museums in a lecture Thursday.
The event, jointly coordinated by the Extension School and Lowell Institute, focused on the development of art museums in the 21st century. About 150 people, including Extension School administrators and students, attended the event in Emerson Hall.
Rogers, who became MFA director in 1994, argued that museums must learn to digitize their permanent collections and curate more interactive live exhibits in response to what he called the “electronic revolution.” The longest-serving director in MFA history, Rogers has overseen evolution of the museum's financial, curatorial, and educational programming.
“Art museums in the twenty-first century cannot return to old tactics and must seek out new definitions of beauty and new ways of doing things,” he said.
He cited recent video game and crowd-sourced exhibitions at the MFA as examples of curatorial innovation aimed at increasing accessibility among museum visitors.
Beyond curatorial decisions, the MFA has also made efforts to extend and offer free museum hours to the public and students, he said, adding that all Harvard students have free admission to the museum.
He also argued that changing demographics in the art world call for adaptation and change from museums.
“Museum-goers today are younger, less affluent, and less likely to have children,” he said. “They are social media savvy and seek a cultural experience, not just an art experience.”
In addition, Rogers discussed the prevalence of contemporary art on display in permanent collections. He said that although contemporary art is increasingly popular, it cannot supplant older forms of art.
“All art is contemporary,” he said. “Not just the shock of the new, but the shock of the old.”
Rogers expressed excitement for the future of the Harvard Art Museums.
“Since the reopening, the Harvard museums appear to be trying to be more of a university collection,” he said, noting efforts to make the museums welcoming to students and faculty in addition to the general public. “There is a definitely a refocusing there.”
Charles Houston, an Extension School admissions coordinator who organized the event, expressed similar hope for Harvard’s arts program.
“It’s such a great resource that we have world-class museums right here on campus,” he said. “I’m hoping the reopening of the arts museums marks a renaissance of the arts on campus.”
Thursday’s lecture marked the latest installment of a lecture series sponsored by the Lowell Institute.

Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching researchers photographed students in 29 courses during a controversial attendance study last spring, the researchers said Thursday when pressed to disclose the exact number of courses studied.
This figure differs from the number of courses, 10, that Samuel T. Moulton '01 mentioned in a September presentation of preliminary findings of the attendance study. That number has been widely reported in the media in recent days.
Moulton and fellow researcher Erin Driver-Linn clarified in an email to The Crimson Thursday that by the Sept. 16 HILT conference, 10 course instructors had provided their consent for the data to be used in their presentation and “the analysis of their data had been refined sufficiently such that they could be reported.” Since mid-September, both HILT researches wrote that Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol has met with most of the 29 course instructors, but further analysis of the other 19 courses not presented at the HILT conference “has not been completed and may not ever be completed.”
Twenty-two courses in the College or Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and seven in the Division of Continuing Education were studied, according to the researchers. Moulton and Driver-Linn did not comment on how many students were in those 29 courses. In the video, Moulton, HILT’s director of Educational Research and Assessment who helped lead the study, said that about 2,000 students were in the 10 courses presented.
The Crimson first identified 10 courses as potential subjects of the study through an analysis that involved cross-referencing enrollment data and syllabi from dozens of lecture courses with the October presentation on the study’s findings. When presented with a list of 10 courses that The Crimson identified through the analysis, Bol declined to confirm any of them Wednesday night.
Students in Physical Science 3: “Electromagnetism, Circuits, Waves, Optics, and Imaging,” Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” Economics 1010b: “Macroeconomic Theory,” and Psychology 15: “Social Psychology” were all photographed as part of the study, according to their respective course instructors, Physics lecturer Logan S. McCarty, senior Statistics lecturer Michael I. Parzen, Economics professor of the practice Christopher L. Foote, and Psychology professor Joshua D. Greene.
Moulton and Driver-Linn did not mention in which lecture halls the cameras were mounted. All of the courses confirmed by The Crimson to be in the study were held in the Science Center.
Students from all 29 courses photographed were notified in an email sent Wednesday afternoon by Bol. The email, shared with The Crimson, did not mention specific courses photographed.
In a statement presented in response to Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 at last week’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Bol said that beginning in August, he began to make appointments with course heads to present data collected and “ask what should happen next.”
According to one faculty member whose course was part of the study, the email contact from Bol and Moulton in early September did not mention how data was collected in the study. Bol wrote in an email Thursday night that during individual meetings, the method of data collection was revealed. He added that by the time of the September conference presenting preliminary findings of the study, course heads had provided him permissions to use data for ten courses. Bol wrote that all of the faculty members he has met with since have also agreed for their course’s data to be used.
Though the study has come under controversy since it first came to light, Driver-Linn and Moulton wrote that the goals of the study were to understand attendance in order to improve learning, not “to bring scrutiny to individual courses, faculty, or students” or “to judge individual courses or faculty. “
The purpose of the study, according to preliminary findings provided to The Crimson, came from the fact that undergraduate attendance had not been “comprehensively or rigorously or measured.” An algorithm was developed over seven months and was trained to accurately identify whether a seat in a lecture hall was empty or full.
In addition to finding attendance rates of courses throughout the semester, the preliminary findings of the study found that courses that factored attendance into overall grade had higher attendance rates than those that did not. Additionally, time of day, day of week, published Q Guide ratings, or the availability of lecture and videos did not show “significant effects.”
Driver-Linn and Moulton reaffirmed that “the underlying imagery data (from which attendance estimates were drawn) have been destroyed for all courses.”

The four tickets vying for the Undergraduate Council’s top spots in the upcoming presidential elections praised Council leaders but attempted to differentiate themselves from the current administration at a debate at the Institute of Politics Thursday night.
Attacking a perceived disconnect between students and the UC, as well as between the Council and administrators, candidates offered different platforms for reforming the Council, with some suggesting the UC needs to be more fun and others criticizing the UC’s internal structure.
All candidates conveyed frustration at the lack of student input in the recently announced decision to close Stillman Infirmary. Vice presidential candidate Stephen A. Turban ’17 said he was “disgusted” by the decision, and Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16, the presidential candidate of a competing ticket, called the impending closure “really bad” and demanded more details on how the system would affect nightly health service and the College’s amnesty policy.
Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, who is running with Ema H. Horvath ’16, criticized the UC’s current leaders, who were aware of the some of the health service changes before Wednesday’s announcement, for failing to notify students of the shift. He further argued that channels of administrative decision-making are not accessible to students and that task forces are only formed after decisions are made, “patronizing” the students.
“I’m still mad,” he said, pointedly glancing at UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15.
Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16 cited last year’s election, in which a joke ticket won the vote, as a referendum on the Council. Though they applauded Mayopoulos and Goffard for increasing awareness of student issues, they made clear there was still room for change.
“I currently think [the UC is] 'derpy' in that it’s decentralized, it’s exclusive, the relevance is lacking, the power for change is unclear…. The role of the UC should involve drastically changing that,” Jackson, who has not served on the Council, said.
Luke R. Heine ’17 and Turban, the only ticket composed of sophomores, argued that the UC should be viewed more as a “culture element” and a “cheerleader” rather than “pragmatic.” They argued that the UC should be a more “fun” institution, and not aspire to mimic state and federal governments. Yet Heine also said that the UC should work to ensure that the College takes student voices more seriously.
“The UC is a joke because the administration treats us as one,” Heine said. “The administration is what delegitimizes the UC.”
Kanuparthy, along with Turban and Heine, attacked the structure of the UC, describing the meetings as “incredibly boring.” He argued that the UC should remain vocal but “actually have more things get done.”
The candidates also offered different views on securing increased UC funding.
Goyal and Nasrollahzadeh laid out a plan to draw funding from alumni donations.
“We need to move on,” Goyal said, referring to the Council’s ultimately unsuccessful campaign to convince University leaders to increase the UC budget by $250,000.
Jackson and Yang, for their part, argued that the Council needed to arrange a more streamlined process for student groups to receive funding.
Others disagreed with those ideas.
Heine said the funding process already was efficient and called Goyal and Nasrollahzadeh’s idea of soliciting alumni donations “presumptuous.”
Horvath presented a simple solution for the UC to more adequately address student needs: “shut up and listen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates expressed concerns and confusion on Thursday over the planned closure of the University’s 24-hour inpatient facility Stillman Infirmary, even as University Health Services officials released more details about the restructuring in health services slated to take effect next semester.
The Crimson first reported on Tuesday night that the facility would shutter amid broader service changes at UHS. On Thursday, UHS Director Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email to the student body that UHS decided curtail urgent-care hours in order to expand same-day appointments and counseling and mental health services. According to the email, UHS’s overnight services are “underutilized,” with less than 250 students per year admitted overnight to Stillman.
Other changes will accompany the curtailed hours. In addition to a phone triage system as an alternative to Stillman’s late-night urgent care, UHS will start to provide “home visits” to students during business hours and increase its support to patients who are transferred to other facilities. Health Services also plans to offer same-day urgent-care online appointment bookings and to expand availability of same-day visits during peak daytime hours, Barreira told The Crimson in an email on Thursday.
Pro Ambulance EMTs will assess intoxicated students and transport them to Mt. Auburn Hospital for further treatment if necessary. Intoxicated students previously had the option of  being walked to Stillman. These changes will not alter Harvard’s alcohol amnesty policy, Barreira clarified.
Student leaders and groups related to student health, such as Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, said that they had been told that changes to health services were coming in recent weeks.
Although UHS had planned to discuss the changes with “those in the community who would be most affected by the change” before the announcement was made publicly, only DAPA, the Undergraduate Council leadership, House Masters, and Resident Deans had been notified at the time The Crimson reported the story, Barreira wrote in his email to The Crimson.
Gurbani Kaur ’17 said that the problematic nature of these changes did not just lie in the specific changes made, but also in the “assumption…that the best thing to do is to focus on daytime services.”
Kaur, who is a member of HealthPALs, a liaison group between UHS and students, said she had learned of these changes through The Crimson and would have liked a conversation between healthcare professionals and the student body before the changes were adopted.
“We’re supposed to trust health care providers, or UHS, but how can we trust health professionals if they don’t trust us to know our needs?” she said.
In the email, Barreira said the decision was made after careful consideration by a task force he had convened to “review the above challenges, analyze data, and evaluate the current system for providing overnight services.” The task force was composed of representatives from various UHS departments.
Kara J.W. Lessin ’16, a peer counselor, said that she did not think alternatives to care at Stillman were suitable, particularly in addressing mental health issues.
“In terms of mental health, triaging has historically not worked too well,” she said. She added that others might be less likely to seek help because they’re unwilling or uncomfortable with going to other services, such as Mount Auburn Hospital.
Lessin, who declined to comment on the record about which peer counseling group she belonged to due to concerns regarding confidentiality, said peer counselors currently accompany students who may be a danger to themselves to Stillman with their permission. These service changes, she said, may prompt changes to her peer counseling group’s policy.
If a student with mental health concerns is determined to need a respite bed after contacting the phone triage number, the issue will be discussed with the student’s Resident Dean, Barreira wrote. He added that UHS is currently discussing with Mount Auburn Hospital the possibility of having respite beds available for Harvard students.
Lessin and other students interviewed said they did not understand why UHS could not both expand services and keep Stillman open.
Several students also raised concerns that there will no longer be a physical space on campus that students seeking healthcare services can go at night. Students who are transported to Mt. Auburn Hospital, located a mile and a half  from the Yard, incur charges that may be paid by their healthcare insurance provider.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 said in an interview on Wednesday they will be working to ensure that students have somewhere to go on campus to receive basic medical care. According to the email sent by Barreira, UHS is working to identify short-term transitional spaces for students who do not require hospital care but do not wish to return home.
Harvard’s planned closure of Stillman follows MIT’s closure of its own 24-hour urgent care in-patient unit in March 2010 for similar reasons. MIT has since replaced the unit with a community care center that expanded its day services and a phone triage system.
According to Barreira, town halls to discuss the new service changes at UHS are planned for the coming days.

Slowly pacing around Lavietes Pavilion, Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens barked instructions. Four days before his team’s season opener, Stevens returned to his college roots, teaching at the Harvard Basketball Coaches Clinic. Unable to work with the varsity—NCAA rules prohibit varsity teams from working with a current NBA head coach—his focus was directed at the club team.
Players flew from spot to spot in the gym, moving with both pace and purpose. Like the public practice Harvard coach Tommy Amaker had held three hours earlier, there was hardly a minute wasted. Each movement was deliberate; motion offenses probed the defense with cut after cut until it bent, and then broke.
The varsity watched with rapt attention; Stevens, after all, was the coach of the miracle Butler teams of 2010 and 2011. College basketball celebrates its underdogs, but Butler was David’s first real chance to break Goliath’s hegemony in decades. Since Jerry Tarkanian’s UNLV Runnin’ Rebels won in 1990, every champion has come from a Big Six conference. Hell, since 1998, the Ivy League has won just three tournament games. In the same span, UConn has won four championships.
Harvard, with Big Dance wins in each of the last two years, carries a lot of similarities to the Butler teams of the late 2000s. Before it broke through against Syracuse in the 2010 Sweet Sixteen, Butler had to endure its share of losses—going 3-3 in the three tournaments prior. Before Gordon Hayward and Matt Howard were national heroes, they were plucky underdogs who were never good enough when it mattered.
With the Associated Press putting Harvard in the preseason Top 25—the first time an Ivy League team garnered the honor since the 1974-1975 season—the hype around this year’s team is as high as ever. The Crimson is one of only five non-major conference teams in the Top 25, but only one of two (along with Wichita State) from a one-bid league in last year’s tournament. The question is not has Harvard arrived, but where does it sit? With conference realignment and an ever-changing landscape; it is no longer ridiculous to ask the once-unthinkable question:
Is Harvard now the country’s best mid-major?
THE TERM
When the term ‘mid-major’ was first introduced in 1977, the Harvard men’s basketball team played its games in the Indoor Athletic Building (now the Malkin Athletic Center) and freshmen were prohibited from playing for the varsity. Forty years later, college basketball pundits have just as hard of a time defining what a mid-major is as when Catholic University coach Jack Kvancz invented it.
Kvancz first used the term glowingly in the aftermath of a loss to Howard University. “It was everything that basketball’s about at the level of our program,” he said then. “For a game between two ‘mid-majors,’ or whatever you’d call us, it had anything you could ask for.”
Calling a Division II team a mid-major in 2014 would get you laughed out of the gym. Other schools push the boundary on the other end. A D-I team like Wichita State—which pays its coach $1.75 million a year and receives $4.7 million annually in donations to a football-less athletic department, but plays in the Missouri Valley Conference—is more Goliath than David.
According to The U.S. Department of Education, meanwhile, the expense for Harvard’s entire basketball team is just $1.3 million. To put that in perspective, Gonzaga spends $6.1 million on its team—bringing in enough revenue ($8.2 million) to cover the expenses for both its own program and the Crimson’s.
The question begs to be asked: how does one truly define a mid-major?
For a while, ‘mid-major’ was the popular phrase for teams like Butler, Gonzaga, and VCU—teams that didn’t play in power conferences but regularly competed with the big boys. However, conference realignment and the establishment of new powers has changed notions of which leagues are power conferences.
“Its tough to tell what a mid-major is these days,” SLAM Magazine’s David Cassilo said. “You have Butler and they are in the Big East conference. They (Butler, Gonzaga, Wichita) are perennial top-25 teams through the last five years and there are a lot of high-major teams you can’t say that about.”
The fuzziness of the picture extends from teams to conferences. The difference between leagues like the A-10 and Conference USA, which send multiple squads to the NCAA Tournament each year, and the six high-major conferences (the Big Ten, the ACC, the Big East, the Big 12, the Pac-12, and the SEC) is on the gridiron, not the hardwood.
Consistent shuffling in league makeup and strength has pundits echoing the famous words of Potter Stewart.
“I had this argument with Doug Gottlieb today over Twitter,” said NBC Sports’ Rob Dauster. “There’s not really a definition for them but you know them when you see them.”
For Dauster, there is no argument over if Harvard is a mid-major. In his 2014-2015 Mid-Major Power Rankings, Dauster has the Crimson at the top. Gonzaga, VCU, and Wichita St. all ranked above Harvard in the AP Poll, but didn’t qualify here due to their “financial resources, support from the university, the fan base and the community, and consistent, high-level success during the season and on the recruiting trail.”
However, regardless of what ranking system is used, consensus is that the composition of the mid-major division—and Harvard’s place within it—hinges on four possible factors: the conference, the schedule, the funding, and the performance.
THE CONFERENCE
When thinking about mid-majors, the strength of the league is most frequently mentioned. When Wichita State completed its undefeated regular season, debate around its spot in the national pecking order centered on the weakness of the Missouri Valley Conference, where just one other team won 20 games. By contrast, in the A-10, VCU’s conference, six teams won at least 20 games. In the WCC, five did.
With that in mind, CollegeInsider.com—whose mid-major poll began to get national recognition in 1998—limits the pool of mid-majors to teams from one-bid leagues. Wichita finished last year in first place, the beneficiary of conference realignment that moved league rival (and top-three seed) Creighton to the Big East. Harvard was fifth, one spot ahead of Gonzaga and the only Ivy League team to receive more than a smattering of votes.
A year later, the Crimson returns stronger than the three teams that finished directly above it—Stephen F. Austin, North Dakota State, and Mercer. Despite losing two starters, the Crimson returns the Ivy League’s Player of the Year in Wesley Saunders and its frontcourt is so deep that four-star recruit Chris Egi is likely resigned to the bench. Some opine that it might even be able to knock the Shockers from their perch.
“This year, if you look at legitimate one-bid leagues, and I think the Missouri Valley might be so [then] Wichita will qualify, Harvard might be the best team coming from a one-bid league,” ESPN Insider’s Jeff Goodman said.
Not everyone agrees with this definition of mid-major, to be clear. Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan argues that conferences like the Ivy League, which are historically thin beyond their flag bearer—formerly Penn and Princeton, now Harvard—are low-, not mid-, majors.
“What Harvard has done has not legitimized the entire league,” Ryan said. “It has legitimized Harvard alone.”
Ryan cited the need for other teams to step up and challenge Harvard at the top. In his mind, a league cannot be a mid-major until it is not a complete shocker when its champion wins a game in the tournament.
“It’s a big story if one team from those conferences wins a game in the tournament—a stop-the-presses kind of moment,” Ryan said.
While Ryan’s perception of the Ivies more closely matches the national view of a group known more for its academics than athletics, the league has slowly been gaining ground. In Sports Illustrated’s rankings of each Division I team, five Ivy League teams were put in the top 150. Dan Hanner rated it the strongest mid-major conference in college basketball and the 12th-best overall. Ken Pomeroy had it as the 14th best—with four teams in the top 150.
Yet, for all of its depth, the Ivy League remains a 14-game series of trap games. Any loss is a bad one come tournament time. Falling on the road in Richmond is a quality loss; losing in Hanover is a blemish that can kill an at-large bid.
“In the Ivy, there aren’t any resume wins,” Goodman said. “So you look down and say, ‘Where other than [in nonconference games,] where are they going to get a resume win,’ and I’m not sure where it comes.”
THE SCHEDULE
The route to national respect, then, is the nonconference schedule. To get multiple bids, a conference must get its second-place team in as an at-large over a middle-of-the-pack high-major squad—essentially forcing the committee to choose Princeton above Illinois or Yale over St. Johns.
This is the weakest part of the argument for Harvard; for a team ranked No. 25 in the AP preseason poll, Harvard’s schedule is far from difficult. Connecticut, last season’s NCAA Tournament champion, and Colorado, a top-25 team before it was beset by injuries, have both disappeared from the Crimson’s schedule.
While Boston College remains on the slate, the Golden Eagles went 8-24 last year and are far from the formidable ACC team that once was the best program in Massachusetts.
A CBSSports.com ranking of college basketball schedules shows a steady and consistent decrease in the difficulty of Harvard’s schedule over the past three seasons.
Tournament teams like Saint Mary’s, Florida State, Michigan, and Saint Joseph’s have all disappeared from Harvard’s schedule over the past five years. While Harvard has retained UMass and added Arizona State, its schedule remains one of the easiest in the country, arguably the easiest for any team in the top 25.
So where does all of this leave Harvard if it wants to be the best mid-major in the country? Charlottesville.
Despite the Crimson’s lackluster schedule, there is one statement game that could make its resume come March. On Dec. 21, Harvard will face Virginia, the No. 9 team in the country, on the road, on primetime television. If Harvard needs an at-large bid come March, its candidacy will hinge on this game.
“It’s a big game,” Casillo said. “When you look at the schedule, you don’t see a lot of high-name teams. There is Virginia, ASU, Boston College, and that is really it. If they don’t win at least one of those games, they won’t be taken seriously.”
“If they can come out of there with a win, this [is] a team that is going to be respected all year long,” he added.
Of course, the team’s chance to rack up nonconference wins is handicapped by a couple of factors. First is the Ivy League’s two-in-four rule, which limits the amount of non-conference tournaments a team can enter to two in four years.
The team’s rising status makes it a difficult game to schedule for top-ranked teams, a bad loss that isn’t yet seen as a good win. Harvard owns the third highest home-court winning percentage in the country over the last four seasons, but it cannot convince many opponents to come to Lavietes, where the Crimson has won 49 of its last 52 games.
As such, when it has played quality opponents in recent years—Memphis, St. Mary’s, etc.—it has always been at their place.
“It has been challenging, it has been difficult,” Amaker said. “It is hard to get teams to think about coming to Boston to come and play us.... It’s been a harder road to travel for us to get some of the games that we thought would be a no-brainer, but in some cases it’s not that way. It’s a backhanded compliment.”
THE MONEY
However, the ultimate determinant of a team’s place in the mid-major hierarchy is its performance on the hardwood. The traditional mid-majors of yesteryear were not high-majors until they backed up their regular season success.
Gonzaga made its name in the tournament with five Sweet Sixteen appearances and one Elite Eight appearance in the past 15 years. Butler has done one better, playing in back-to-back NCAA championship games. VCU backed up its run to the Final Four with consecutive tournament berths; Wichita State followed up its own tournament run with an undefeated regular season and a No. 1 seed.
These kinds of accolades lift a team from a mid-major into talk as a high-major, with increases in funding changing perceptions altogether. Though money and resources are typically byproducts of sustained success, Wichita State has proven that a short burst of unprecedented results can quickly change the perception of a team.
After making the tournament only four times in the last 25 years, the Shockers—which were ranked at the top of the mid-major poll last season—are now in consideration to be a high-major this preseason. Why? Funding.
According to ESPN’s business reporter Darren Rovell, Wichita’s sponsorship is on track to reach a record $2 million, up from $1.4 million just a year ago. According to Wichita State’s sports management program, last season’s Final Four run resulted in $555.2 million in revenues—a number that screams high-major.
Similarly, VCU, a traditionally labeled mid-major program, has begun to make strides towards becoming a high-major. The Rams have become a consistent favorite to win the Atlantic 10 conference and have made seven tournament appearances in the last 10 years, and, like Harvard, have a premier coach in Shaka Smart. A previously unknown program nationally, VCU will play 15 nationally televised games this year and has in place a plan for a 60,000-square foot practice facility with a $25 million price tag.
“We still probably instinctively think of Wichita, Gonzaga, Butler, as mid-majors,” Goodman said. “When you talk about the support, certainly Gonzaga and Wichita St., they don’t have the support of mid-majors. They are high-majors all the way.”
Goodman continued to say that even teams like Wichita and Gonzaga, who come from traditionally one-bid conferences, can hardly lay claim to being on the same funding level as the typical mid-major.“They are in leagues that are one or two bid [conferences].... That’s why we kind of tend to put them as mid-majors,” Goodman said. “They probably aren’t.”
Other mid-majors have taken notice, noting the distinction between the funding available at these programs and the rest of the conference.
“The reality is that the money is at such a different level [for some high-major jobs] that at some point, you can’t compete,” said Tommy McClelland, Louisiana Tech’s athletics director, in an interview with ESPN.
THE PERFORMANCE
Where does this leave the Crimson?
The final piece of the puzzle comes down to performance. After earning impressive wins in the last two NCAA Tournaments, the Crimson has established itself as a consistent threat that is knocking on the door of a deep tournament run, and it may just be time to open up that door.
Like Butler, Xavier, and Gonzaga before it, Harvard is battle-tested. The seniors lining the roster—from wing Wesley Saunders to forwards Steve Moundou-Missi, Jonah Travis, and Kenyatta Smith—have ended each season of their careers in the NCAA Tournament. They’ve knocked off two top-five seeds and were six minutes from the Sweet Sixteen a year ago.
Amaker has built a mid-major in an era full of them. Traditional powerhouses like Kentucky, Duke, and Kansas are all at the mercy of the NBA, as early exits for the draft force them to welcome in top freshmen every year. This has consistent, experienced teams thriving, keeping kids on campus for four consecutive years.
Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers are both potential professional players, but, like current Lakers guard Jeremy Lin ’10, neither have left early for the draft. As a result, while plenty of teams had impressive 2013-2014 campaigns, few have returned the upper-class talent or tournament experience that resides in Cambridge. The ability to retain talent year-over-year and consistent winning has lifted Harvard above recent mid-major fads, according to Goodman.
“They are certainly one of the best, most consistent, true mid-majors over the last four to five years,” Goodman said. “You’ve got some other good ones right now that I think have a real chance to be good like Stephen F. Austin, Toledo, and Louisiana Tech, but those are all schools that aren’t consistent like Harvard has been.”
This consistent success has come in the face of a host of obstacles; though Harvard boasts a name that few other programs can contend with, Ivy League recruiting constraints, a stringent Academic Index, and the inability to offer athletic scholarships puts the Crimson at a marked disadvantage.
Harvard is a true mid-major in every sense of the word. Despite the traction that #2BidIvy received a year ago, the Ancient Eight is still solidly a one-bid league. Harvard has chances to impress in the nonconference schedule, but it will likely have to run the table in its biggest matchups (UMass, ASU, UVA) to even have a chance at an at-large bid.
However, none of those deterrents have stopped Amaker from building a program among the nation’s best. Since taking over seven years ago, he has brought Harvard from the bottom of the Ancient Eight’s basement  into the limelight of college basketball as its top mid-major.
“Harvard is going to be good as long as Tommy Amaker is there,” Goodman said. “And right now, even if Amaker ever left, there would be people really wanting to take that Harvard job, where, when he took it, no one wanted it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first Bracketology prediction of the year, ESPN expert Joe Lunardi has placed the Crimson as a No. 6 seed in the NCAA Tournament. This would be the highest seed that Harvard has ever had in the Big Dance by a factor of a half after the Crimson entered the Big Dance last year as a then-record 12th seed.
The seed is roughly commensurate with Harvard’s preseason No. 25 Associated Press ranking, although Lunardi drops the two teams directly ahead of the Crimson in the poll—Syracuse and Michigan—to No. 7 seeds. It would make Harvard the second-highest seed from a one-bid league, coming in right behind projected No. 2 seed Wichita State (of the Missouri Valley Conference).
Lunardi projects only one team that the Crimson is scheduled to play this year to make the tournament—Virginia. The Cavaliers, who were selected as a No. 3 seed, will host Harvard in late December. Other key Harvard nonconference opponents, such as Arizona State and UMass, were not picked to make the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight down, two to go. For the undefeated Harvard football team, a pair of wins is all that’s needed to secure a perfect season and an Ivy League championship.
Fans may already be looking ahead to the annual showdown with Yale in just over a week. But taking it one day at a time as always, the Crimson has its sights set on Philadelphia where it will travel to tangle with Penn this Saturday.
The long bus ride back to Cambridge has the potential to be extra special, as a win over the Quakers (1-7, 1-4 Ivy) would give Harvard (8-0, 5-0) at least a share of the Ancient Eight title. Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale all reside in second place with just a single conference loss.
Past battles with the Quakers have typically had championship implications, but the contest has lost some of its luster this year. A perennial contender in previous seasons, Penn finds itself buried in sixth place with only one conference win against Columbia.
It’s a disappointing way to go out for longtime Quakers coach Al Bagnoli, who announced that this would be his last year before the season began. Bagnoli ranks second all-time with 111 Ivy wins; Crimson coach Tim Murphy sits just nine behind.
“I’m shocked by their record,” Murphy said. “I don’t think anyone saw this coming, and I think it just reinforces how fragile college football can be…. If you look at the body of coach Bagnoli’s work, he and his staff, it’s been amazingly consistent.”
Bagnoli’s squad has had its struggles on both offense and defense this season. Quarterback Alek Torgersen has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns (10), and Penn’s leading running back is averaging less than 40 yards per game.
The Quaker defense ranks sixth in the Ancient Eight, forcing only eight turnovers thus far. The cumulative effect has been Penn losing its six games by an average of just over 18 points.
Perhaps the most glaring difference between Harvard and Penn comes on the defensive side of the ball. The Crimson defense has found its rhythm over the past several weeks and currently ranks first in Division I with just 9.4 points allowed per game.
A strong defensive front seven featuring senior Zack Hodges, classmate Obum Obukwelu, and junior James Duberg—who have combined for 12 sacks this season—anchors Harvard on the line of scrimmage.
“We beat the mess out of them up front,” Hodges said. “I think the film shows we like to hit them in the mouth. It starts in the front.”
One level back, the Crimson has witnessed athletic plays from a capable linebacking corps that includes leading tacklers juniors Matt Koran and Eric Medes. In the secondary, captain Norman Hayes headlines a crew of defensive backs that ranks first in the Ivy League against the pass.
The defensive unit flexed its muscle in last Saturday’s shutout of Columbia by forcing six turnovers, including three interceptions returned for touchdowns.
“I think the biggest factor has been we’re a team that doesn’t beat [itself] on defense,” Murphy said. “We rarely ever make a mistake.”
The 2013 rendition of the showdown came down to the wire but fell Harvard’s way in a 38-30 decision. While the Crimson escaped with the win, its defense allowed four consecutive second half touchdowns. Such a happening seems unlikely to recur considering Harvard hasn’t surrendered more than a single touchdown in a game since week two.
After sitting out last week’s game against Columbia due to a shoulder injury, senior quarterback Conner Hempel will be a game-time decision for this Saturday. When healthy, the Crimson offense has demonstrated considerable firepower, most notably by amassing a school record 698 yards in a 49-7 victory over Princeton in week six.
The season has officially entered the final stretch run with just two games remaining. With its destiny in its own hands, undefeated Harvard is firmly locked on the task ahead.
“There’s always pressure, but we’re a great team in handling that pressure,” said junior wide receiver Andrew Fischer. “I don’t think anything changes. We’re just going to go out there and execute and play Crimson football.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Lavietes Pavilion was filled, junior forward Agunwa Okolie was flying through the air with a 360-windmill dunk, bringing even the Boston Celtic’s Jared Sullinger and his fellow judges to their feet. While Friday night’s contest for the Harvard men’s basketball team and Massachusetts Institute of Technology won’t feature any judges or scorecards like Crimson Madness did, that doesn’t mean there won’t be any high flying dunks from Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s explosive front court in its opener.
The Crimson is ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press preseason poll and was the unanimous choice to win the Ivy League for a fourth straight year. MIT, meanwhile, is a Division-III program that was bounced out of the first round of the NCAA Division III tournament after a 23-point loss to Plattsburgh State. While their gymnasiums are only two miles apart, the strength of their basketball programs could not be farther.
Harvard returns superstars in junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, the 2012-2013 Ivy League Rookie of the Year and senior wing Wesley Saunders, last season’s Ivy League Player of the Year, who make up one of the best backcourts in the country.
“We are now the hunted—before, we were the hunters,” said Saunders. “We are not to worried about it. We are going to go in and just play our game like we have up to this point and everything will work itself out.”
In addition, Harvard’s frontcourt is just as imposing, with three seniors, captain Steve Moundou-Missi, forward Jonah Travis, and center Kenyatta Smith, all back. Smith, who missed most of last season due to an injury, will provide the inside shot-blocking ability that the Crimson missed late last season.
“It’s great to know that we are one of the most dominant teams in the area,” Saunders said. “We enjoy beating hometown rivals and going out there and just playing well.”
Nonetheless, the Engineers do return its top two scorers in senior forwards Matt Redfield (13.0 points per game) and Andrew Acker (11.8), both of who have Division-I size and strength. While MIT may have a chance to match up with Harvard inside, containing Chambers and Saunders on the perimeter will be the true test if the Engineers wish to pull off an early upset.
Last year, Harvard coasted to a 79-37 win over MIT, clearing the bench, which resulted in every active player on roster scoring. Chambers and Saunders played less than a half and recorded 20 points, six rebounds, five assists and four steals between the pair.
But with the graduation of captains Laurent Rivard ’14 and Brandyn Curry ’14, a lack of three-point shooting may cause some early problems for the Crimson. As a result, Friday’s contest will mark more than just the season opener for the Crimson, as Harvard will get a chance to redefine itself with a loaded frontcourt and two guards that have become Ivy League household names.
“We are anxious to see who we are going to be right now, playing against other folks and our opponents,” Amaker said. “MIT is a terrific program. We have won games against them, but they do have a culture of winning.”
Besides the pure talent differential between the two squads, Harvard boasts another definitive advantage: playing at home.
Since Harvard’s seniors first took the floor in 2010, the Crimson is 49-3 (.942) at Lavietes, ranking behind only Belmont (51-2, .962) and Duke (63-3, .955) for the third-highest home winning percentage in the nation.
The Crimson has won nine straight home openers dating back to 2005. Though opening against a Division-III program should be an easier matchup for Amaker’s squad, Harvard still won’t be taking any chances.
“[MIT] is a program and a team that expects to do well,” Amaker said. “They expect to do well and compete and to win at their level and we are very hopeful that we can get out to a good start as the season kicks off and gets underway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Swinging.
With a bang.
Of style.
Like a lamb.
On a limb.
I could go on, but you get the jist. There are a lot of ways to “go out…” Almost all of them would be preferable to the departure Penn coach Al Bagnoli has lined up Saturday when he leads the Quakers into Franklin Field for the final time.
This is Bagnoli’s 23rd season and by far his worst on the field. Penn is 1-7, 1-4 in Ivy play, on pace for Bagnoli’s worst record by far except for 1997, when the team had to forfeit all but one of its wins after an eligibility scandal.
It would be easy to make fun of Bagnoli’s plight if it just wasn’t so darn sad. I might mockingly compare him to an Emperor watching the sacking of Rome while mentioning that his quarterback has been brought down 23 times, second in the Ivy League. I could go cinematic and say Jerry Thompson in Citizen Kane could have been talking about Bagnoli when he said Charles Kane “was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it”—except for the fact that Bagnoli has not fallen once but lost seven times in eight games. I could talk about Shaquille O’Neal’s Celtics years and make a joke about Bagnoli somehow managing to be a bigger disappointment than the Big Disappointment.
I really could. But I can’t. All I want to say is, “I’m sorry,” but not yet.
The only Ivy coach to win nine league titles, post consecutive undefeated league seasons (he did it thrice), or win .714 percent of his conference games should not have to lead a 1-7 team in his final go-round. After doing so much right, Bagnoli let William Hung sing his swan song. What was supposed to be a celebratory parade has become a funeral procession.
And it’s only going to get worse this weekend.
Enter Harvard (8-0, 5-0). The Crimson’s 23.4 average margin of victory is 10 points larger than any other Ivy team’s. Its defense ranks first in the FCS in points allowed. Its turnover margin is twice as good as anyone else’s in the conference. And it’s hungry.
The last time Harvard went down to Philadelphia, the Quakers out-muscled the Crimson, 30-21, to earn an Ivy title. It was the last in a run of quasi-championship games as one of the two schools won the league for six straight years and in 11 out of 13 seasons.
Harvard players still bring that mentality to the rivalry, and they are ready to show their dominance Saturday.
This game should have more meaning than that, too. It should be a seminal passing-of-the-torch moment from the league’s current elder statesmen to its next.
Except Penn has already stomped out its flame, peed on it, and then smothered it with a wool blanket.
Sorry, Al.
On the picks...
BROWN AT DARTMOUTH
This had the potential to be a major trap game for the Big Green (6-2, 4-1). While Brown (4-4, 2-3) sits right in the middle of the standings, the Bears boast the second best defense in the league behind record-setting Harvard and they haven’t lost any game by more than 14. But, running back Tyler Varga and Yale knocked the air out of Brown by knocking it out of title contention in a back-and-forth 45-42 win last weekend. I don’t see the Bears getting up for another big game this time around. Look for Dartmouth to survive and enter next week’s matchup against Princeton with a chance to earn a share of the Ivy title if Harvard stumbles.
Prediction: Dartmouth 27, Brown 19
CORNELL AT COLUMBIA
Coaches are fond of saying “It was one of those games somebody had to lose.” It’s quintessential meaningless coach garble, but the corollary actually applies here. The Empire State Bowl (yes, that’s an official name) between the Lions (0-8, 0-5) and the Big Red (0-8, 0-5) is one of those games somebody has to win, unfortunately. I would list all of the other bowls I’d rather watch for three hours Saturday, but this is a family newspaper, so I’ll get straight to the prediction and move on.
Prediction: Columbia 24, Cornell 16
PRINCETON AT YALE
The big game of the week is a rare elimination game in Ivy football. Either the Tigers (5-3, 4-1) or the Bulldogs (7-1, 4-1) will enter week 10 with a chance to win a title share. I see Yale pulling through on the back of Varga and the arm of quarterback Morgan Roberts over a Princeton team that was not able to blowout cellar-dwelling Cornell and Penn over the last two weeks. An Eli victory would set up one of the most interesting Games in years next week as both Harvard and Yale would be playing with title implications.
Prediction: Yale 37, Princeton 20
HARVARD AT PENNSYLVANIA
Senior Day + Bagnoli’s final home game = a motivated Penn side, but that will not be enough. Look for the emotional squad to start hot and keep pace for a while, but expect the Crimson’s bruising offensive line and nearly unbreakable defense to ultimately help Harvard move one game away from a perfect season.
Prediction: Harvard 34, Penn 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a lackluster opening 15 minutes to Harvard’s season, all it took was a dunk to get the team rolling once more.
With 5:20 left in the first half against MIT, senior wing Wesley Saunders swung the ball up to the top of the key to junior co-captain Siyani Chambers. Saunders, who had been waiting in the right corner, immediately cut to the nearside second hash mark while classmate Jonah Travis slashed to the middle of the paint. Chambers sent the rock to Saunders who touched it down to Travis, and the big man slammed it home to give Harvard its first eight-point lead of the half.
And with that, Harvard men’s basketball was back.
While the two teams traded baskets for much of the opening period, Travis’s dunk along with a surfeit of Chambers treys that soon followed broke the game wide open, and MIT (0-1) never truly contended again, ultimately falling to the Crimson (1-0), 73-52, Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
“I give them a lot of credit, [MIT] played a great game, played hard,” Chambers said. “We had some first game jitters coming out, but around the late [part of the] first half we started catching our rhythm and really doing the stuff Coach wanted us to do.”
Two possessions after the Travis slam, the Crimson swung the ball around the horn once more. Sophomore guard Corbin Miller ended up with the rock, while Travis ran out to set a screen. Miller forewent the pick, and sent the ball instead to Chambers, who caught it on the right wing, dribbled once, pulled up, and drilled a trey to extend Harvard’s lead to nine.
The next Crimson possession saw more of the same—Miller sent a pass to freshman guard Andre Chatfield, who found Chambers on the left wing this time. Different spot, same result, giving the home team its first double-digit advantage of the season.
For good measure, Chambers added another trey to his stat sheet just two minutes later, when he knocked down a shot from the top of the key right before intermission. MIT never came closer than 13 points after that bucket, and despite what Chambers called the team’s “first game jitters,” Harvard finished opening night with confidence.
True to form, it was the two guys that Amaker consistently calls Harvard’s “best player” and “most important player”—Saunders and Chambers, respectively—that led the team on Friday.
While Chambers tallied 15 first half points to lead all scorers, Saunders played more of a facilitator role in the opening period, collecting eight rebounds and dishing out five assists before intermission.
But when the second half began, something shifted and Saunders began to put the ball on the floor nearly every time down the court.
With 17 minutes to go, after Saunders had penetrated the paint and earned trips to the free throw line on consecutive possessions, an MIT pass between junior guard Ryan Frankel and sophomore forward Tim Butala got broken up, and the ball ended up in Saunders’s hands. The senior went coast to coast, laying the ball in to give Harvard its biggest of the night at 19.
After the game, Saunders explained that his decision to be more active with the ball was a result of what he sensed his team needed.
“[I adjusted] with the flow of the game,” Saunders said. “It just happened that some guys were getting open and I was finding them in the first half. In the second half, I was trying to provide a little more energy. We were getting a little stagnant on our offense, so I just tried to push the tempo a little bit.”
Saunders finished the contest with team-highs in rebounds and assists, with nine and six, respectively, and tied for the team-high in points with 15.
On the other side of the court, MIT also relied on its lengthy wingman to shoulder the offensive burden. Junior guard Justin Pedley scored the first bucket of the game—a jumper from about a foot and a half behind the three-point line—and kept gunning the rest of the night. The marksman finished the contest having shot more than one-third of the Engineers’ field goals, going 7-for-16 in 39 minutes of play.
The play of the night, however, came from an unlikely source in an unlikely way. With Harvard up 17 and 11 minutes to go in the matchup, rookie Chatfield intercepted an errant MIT inbounds pass and sprinted up the court. The 6’4” guard reached the paint and took off, elevating for a two-hand dunk to the approval of both his teammates and the crowd.
Ultimately though, for the Crimson, Friday’s win marked just the first box to check off in the four-month grind that is the collegiate basketball season. And for a team with ever-climbing aspirations, there is no time to dwell on an opening-night victory.
“It was good to get the first game out of the way,” Saunders said. “MIT is a good team…and they forced us into a good game. So it was a good way to start off the season but [now we’re onto] Holy Cross.”

It’s now obvious why Mark E. Zuckerberg '06 stole The Facebook. He did it so that 500 million people could watch his Public Display of Affection toward his 'friend', Priscilla Chan '07.
“I met an amazing girl on this day exactly 11 years ago,” he posted to his Facebook, while he presumably sat next to her. Didn’t you learn anything from Taylor Swift’s new music video? This is millennial romance. (We used the word millennial, finally! What a millennial dream).
We can only imagine what the Winklevii’s tribute to each other might have looked like: pictures of them at the boathouse, in the PC bike room, and posing in a lake.
Mark, it’s never too late to come back and take a class on video editing. Section sizes might be getting smaller. Innovation!
