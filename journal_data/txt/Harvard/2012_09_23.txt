After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nas’ rapping has always been characterized by a stark honesty. On his 1994 classic, “Illmatic,” Nas painted a grim picture of his childhood in Queens, where he grew up a witness to crime and poverty. On his latest album, “Life Is Good,” Nas retains his honesty but introduces new themes that reflect recent events in his private life, such as familial troubles. “Life Is Good” showcases a more mature Nas and combines his frankness with a newfound maturity.
On “Life is Good,” Nas aims for straightforward storytelling, not complex wordplay. However, this simplicity is a strength rather than a weakness. On “Accident Murderers,” he depicts children growing up in his hometown, transformed by poverty into murderers. He bemoans the innocent young lives tarnished by a dangerous lifestyle: “Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons / Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds.”
Nas uses this crisp storytelling to capture new themes. On “Bye Baby,” a smooth ballad about his recent divorce, Nas explores the magnitude of his love for his former wife: “I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin / Yet, the cuter version.” However, he comes to terms with the breakup, closing with the poignant lines, “Next go ’round I hope I pick the truest type / And watch me do it all again, it’s a beautiful life.”
On “Daughters,” Nas laments his failure as a parent, explicitly referencing an inappropriate picture his daughter posted on Twitter, and admitting, “At this point I realized I ain’t the strictest parent.” He closes the verse pledging to change for his daughter: “They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world / God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls.” Nas is far from the gun-wielding gangster he portrayed himself as on “N.Y. State of Mind,” yet he is the same vivid wordsmith.
Not every song on the album is remarkable. “Summer On Smash,” for example, is produced by Swizz Beatz and sounds like Nas rapping over a Cobra Starship B-side. With the repetition of vapid lyrics such as “My neck got a whole lot of glass” and “Look at baby girl, showing that ass,” this track feels out of place on an otherwise emotionally charged album.
However, the Swizz Beatz misstep is overshadowed by the rest of the album’s imaginative production, led by longtime Nas collaborators No ID and Salaam Remi. “A Queens Story” showcases one of the most impressive instrumental tracks of the album. The syncopated orchestral hits complement Nas’s voice incredibly well, and the pentatonic mode and jazzy instrumentation recall a ’60s orchestral musical. In fact, from the unforgettable electric organ of “Accidental Murderers” to the complex synthesizer pad chords of “Bye Baby,” the beats on “Life Is Good” are consistently fresh and complex and make up for Nas’s occasional lapses in lyricism.
Although more mature and refined than his earlier releases, “Life Is Good” doesn’t escape “Illmatic’s” influence, something that has haunted Nas’s work for the past two decades. “Loco-Motive” opens with the sound of a train running over tracks, the same sound that opened his debut album. While this brief tribute reminds the listener of Nas’ earlier work and shows how far he has come, the repeated allusions to his classic come off as a little contrived and unimaginative. On “Accidental Murderers,” Nas plays the same character that he played on “Illmatic’s” “Life’s A Bitch,” and Rick Ross plays the same role that AZ did on the original, glorifying the “hood” lifestyle that Nas criticizes afterward.
But through poignantly honest stories such as “Bye Baby,” Nas doesn’t just reconnect with himself on his latest album—he redefines himself. No longer telling the same coming-of-age story that he has been expounding since 1994, Nas eloquently explores his shortcomings as a father and the pains of divorce, showing his still-sharp lyricism and impressive range.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five months after winning the Harvard Law School student government presidency on a platform to rewrite the student government constitution and resign before Commencement, President-in-Absentia Matthew P. Gelfand, who graduated last spring, has completed a draft of the new constitution at last.
 
Gelfand and his vice president and current acting president Jordan B. Roberts hope to release a final draft of the constitution and ratify it before the October student government elections.
 
Gelfand wrote the constitution over the summer with input from a volunteer reform committee of current and just-graduated law students. In May, Gelfand administered a survey to the student body about the role the student government should play at the Law School. He said he incorporated much of what the respondents—nearly 400 students—expressed in their answers into the draft of the new constitution.
 
The constitution now frames the student government as one focused on representing students’ interests rather than on making decisions, though it would have a committee in charge of planning events and would continue to oversee the formation of student groups, among other tasks.
 
To reflect this ideological shift, Gelfand plans to rename the student government as the Harvard Law School Student Representative Board and formally make all students at the Law School members of the Student Representative Board.
“I don’t know the history of when all of these organizations started being called governments, but I don’t see student government at the Law School...as governing the student body,” said Gelfand, who is currently working in New York University’s general counsel’s office on a fellowship. “I think the best role for the organization is an advocacy one.”
 
Although the new constitution redefines the body’s principles, it does not address the role that student government should play in allocating funds to student organizations.
 
“That was by far the most controversial aspect of the survey,” Gelfand said. “It was just hard to come up with something that everybody would be happy with, and I couldn’t in good conscience put forward a constitution that had a specific procedure on that issue.”
 
Gelfand said he will leave this issue for the incoming student government officers to solve.
 
Last year, the student government constitution was amended so that the incoming president and vice president would take office on April 1 instead of at the end of the year to create a longer transition period. This amendment allowed Gelfand to run for president as a third-year student. Gelfand’s new draft of the constitution eliminates the possibility of graduating students running for office.  
 
Rachna Shah, who acted as vice president of the student government from 2011 to 2012 and lost to Gelfand in the presidential election, which he won by a plurality, said that she was saddened that Gelfand “took the liberty” to extend the constitutional writing process over the summer and that a formal student government does not currently exist. Gelfand is not on campus and Roberts is acting as president—the sole member of student government, without any representatives or a board.
 
“Changing the name isn’t going to change the fact that there needs to be people who make decisions and can advocate on behalf of students on behalf of those decisions to the administration,” Shah said.
 
Roberts and Gelfand said that they have not received much feedback on the new draft of the constitution. Roberts said that half of the comments he has received are grammatical.
 
“Law students being law students, commas make a difference,” he said.
 
Law School Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove said that few students seem interested in the new constitution or the upcoming elections.
“This is a non-issue for 99 percent of the student body,” Cosgrove said. “There’s a handful of students who were involved last year who were upset, but other than that...people don't seem very focused on that at all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two match points in the fourth set, it seemed as if the Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-9, 0-1 Ivy) was poised to turn its season around by winning its Ivy League opener. But two Dartmouth kills forced a fifth set, and the Big Green prevailed, 25-22, 20-25, 22-25, 28-26, 15-10, in Hanover on Friday night.
In each of the first four sets, the Crimson got off to quick starts but was only able to hold on to win the second and third. In the deciding fifth set, Dartmouth (2-8, 1-0 Ivy) took an 11-6 lead off of a kill, and Harvard could not recover and ultimately fell, 15-10.
“It was definitely ours to win,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, “but sometimes things just don’t work out your way.”
After a service ace by freshman setter Hannah Schmidt gave the Crimson a four point lead in the first set, the Big Green called a timeout and immediately went on a 3-0 run off of three straight kills. The remainder of the set was neck-and-neck, with Dartmouth ultimately taking the frame, 25-22.
In the second set, a Big Green service error gave Harvard its largest lead of the set, 10-5. Despite the strong start, Dartmouth fought back to cut the Crimson lead to one, 21-20, before Harvard got four straight kills to close out the set, 25-20.
In the third, the Crimson started hot and took a 13-8 lead off of a kill by captain outside hitter Taylor Docter. But a kill by Dartmouth outside hitter Alex Schoenberger sparked an 11-4 run that gave the Big Green a two-point lead. Docter answered with three straight spikes, and junior Erin Cooney clinched the set with a kill.
One set away from taking its second match of the season, Harvard got off to another quick start, leading Dartmouth early, 10-5. The Big Green fought back the rest of the set to tie the score, 23-23. Docter responded with a kill to give the Crimson match point, but Schoenberger answered with a kill to even it up. The Crimson had yet another chance after winning the next point, but this time a kill by junior middle blocker Elisa Scudder tied the score again. That was Harvard’s last match point, and Dartmouth closed out the frame with an ace.
After winning the first point in the deciding set, the Crimson never had the lead again and ultimately fell, 15-10.
“I don’t think that we have any big strategic changes to make,” said sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey. “I don’t think that anything specifically went wrong necessarily…. We really just need to be able to close when we have the opportunity.”
Despite droppings its sixth straight game, the Crimson seems to be playing better than its record indicates.
“We’ve been losing a lot, but [Friday] night…we were proud of how we played,” Casey said. “We were playing well, and we were playing hard, and we left with a sense of pride in the fact that we played really hard the whole time. But there’s disappointment that we did in fact play well and work really hard and it just didn’t go in our way.”
Going forward, the team hopes to use this disappointment to its advantage.
“I think it’s frustrating, but we’re moving on, and we’re excited because we know we can definitely take on Dartmouth when they come back to Harvard,” Wallace said. “I think it will also give us a good motivation factor going into the rest of the Ivy League.”
Against the Big Green, Docter finished with a double-double, notching 24 kills and 15 digs. Casey led the team with 20 digs, while senior setter Beth Kinsella had 27 assists on the match.
“It’s been a tough preseason for us, and we’re sort of waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel here because we’re working hard, we’re pushing through,” Casey said. “We’re disappointed obviously, but, if anything, we’re just more excited to get back out there against Dartmouth and against other teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team traveled west for its final weekend before the start of Ivy League play but returned empty-handed, falling to Cal Poly on Friday night, 2-1, and to No. 3 UC Santa Barbara, 1-0, on Sunday afternoon.
NO. 3 UC SANTA BARBARA 1, HARVARD 0
Facing one of the highest-ranked opponents on its schedule, the Harvard men’s soccer team failed to tie up the match in the final stretch after allowing an early goal. The Crimson eventually fell, 1-0, to the Gauchos on Sunday afternoon at Meredith Field at Harder Stadium.
With the Crimson (1-5-1) already down a goal 14 minutes into the match, it appeared that UC Santa Barbara (6-0-2) would lengthen its lead in the 33rd minute after junior forward Dom Sarle sent a header toward the left corner of the net.
The Gauchos’ fans were already cheering before they noticed that Harvard freshman goalkeeper Joe Festa had dexterously managed the save.
“It was a shot that shouldn’t have been saved,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “He dove and barely got a fingertip on it…. Joe came up absolutely huge for us.”
Festa finished with a total of eight saves on the afternoon, limiting UC Santa Barbara to a single score. But it wasn’t enough, as Harvard was unable to find the back of the net on its three shots.
From the starting whistle, the Gauchos midfield pressured relentlessly, keeping the ball on the Crimson defensive end for the majority of the first half. After placing three shots on goal within the first 12 minutes, UC Santa Barabara scored its lone goal  in the 14th minute when junior forward Javier Castro headed in a cross that senior defender Peter McGlynn sent into the six-yard box. The Gauchos’ offense continued to apply pressure and kept Harvard from having any offensive chances, topping the Crimson in shots, 8-0, and in corner kicks, 1-0, in the first period.
“I think UCSB came out strong, with a lot of movement off of the ball, so we were on our heels during the first half,” Friedman said. “We were definitely a little frustrated after the first period.”
Moving into the second half, the pace of the game began to shift in Harvard’s favor and the Gauchos’ defense scrambled. Crimson players credited the team’s endurance with its ability to penetrate the Gauchos’ midfield.
“All year we’ve been stressing the importance of fitness,” senior forward Zack Wolfenzon said. “We knew that UCSB would be a good, quick team, but eventually they would give in. We were the fitter team. We really went after them in the second half.”
The Crimson managed to get three shots in the final period, but each was off target. The Gauchos had chances as well, finishing with eight shots of their own in the frame. But thanks in large part to the play of Festa, UC Santa Barbara was unable to capitalize.
“I think going forward, Joe will be playing with a lot more confidence knowing he contested so well against a No. 3 team,” Friedman said. “He just showed a lot of confidence coming in as the backup goalie.”
Although the game ended in a loss, the Harvard team was pleased with its overall performance.
“I was really impressed during the second half.... We had so many chances,” Friedman said. “We really responded well to the No. 3 team in the country. They were a really excellent team.”
Freshman forward Jake Freeman provided the Crimson its best scoring opportunity in the 63rd minute, firing a shot on goal that was stopped by Gaucho keeper Austin Mansker. Harvard continued to apply pressure and sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi recorded the Crimson’s second shot in the 83rd minute, an attempt that went wide.
With the clock running out and less than two minutes remaining in the match, Friedman lobbed in a long throw-in to Freeman, who received the ball and took a left-footed shot that just missed the net—two feet high—for Harvard’s final shot of the match.
“It was unfortunate we didn’t score, but I really think we gave them a scare,” Friedman said.
UC Santa Barbara outshot the Crimson, 8-3, in the second half, but Harvard bested the Gauchos on corner kicks, 5-1.
Wolfenzon believes Sunday’s close contest will provide a confidence boost for Harvard heading into its Ivy opener against Yale (3-3-2) on Saturday.
“[This match] showed [us that] we can hang on the field with one of the top-three teams,” Wolfenzon said. “We are excited and ready [for the start of Ivy play]…. We are confident in our ability to both play soccer and outwork teams.”
CAL POLY 2, HARVARD 1
Despite a strong start, the Harvard men’s soccer team came up just short Friday night, as the Crimson fell to Cal Poly, 2-1, at Alex G. Spanos Stadium in the first of its two weekend contests.
Harvard came out strong against the Mustangs (5-3) in the first half, with junior midfielder Kyle Henderson taking the first shot of the game. Henderson’s attempt sailed over the bar, but the Crimson continued to provide offensive pressure. After Harvard missed its first five shots, senior forward Zack Wolfenzon netted his first goal of the season in the 27th minute to give the Crimson the lead.
Wolfenzon has been a key player for Harvard since returning from injury in the Crimson’s match against Michigan State on Sept. 7.
After the Crimson’s 3-2 overtime loss to Southern Methodist University on Sept. 9, Harvard coach Carl Junot pointed specifically to Wolfenzon and sophomore forward Michael Innocenzi as integral pieces of the Harvard offense.
“We need them to score some goals for us, but they created a lot of our offense by running past their defenders and crossing in balls, so I think they influenced the game in the way we like them too,” said Junot after the loss to SMU. “They just need to score goals.”
Two matches later, Wolfenzon made good on Junot’s wish, dribbling the ball 40 yards down the field through three Mustang defenders. The forward then beat Cal Poly goalie Chase Hauser to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
The defense also did its part to keep the Mustangs shut out in the first half, limiting their offense to only four shots in the period.
But Harvard had issues with penalties, receiving two yellow cards—one for Wolfenzon and another for the whole team—and a red card on freshmen goalkeeper Evan Mendez, who handled the ball outside of the box for his second red card of the season. Mendez’s ejection forced the Crimson to change goalkeepers, and classmate Festa stepped in late in the first half.
“We were doing well until the red card,” senior co-captain Scott Prozeller said. “Being a man down was difficult.”
Despite these setbacks, Harvard went into halftime boasting a 1-0 lead.
But it was the Mustangs’ quickness that eventually allowed them to outlast the Crimson. And with a man advantage, Cal Poly controlled the ball for most of the second period.
Mustangs junior forward Ian Clark tied up the game in the 53rd minute on a close-range shot. Clark received a pass from junior midfielder George Malki with his back to the goal and then spun around his defender to slot the ball into the bottom left corner of the net.
Ten minutes later, it seemed that Harvard had regained its lead when it sent a ball into the back of the net, but the goal was called back after being ruled offside.
Junior forward Chris Bernardi then fired a shot into the top left corner of the net in the 72nd minute to put Cal Poly on top. The Mustangs held the lead and secured their fifth straight victory after the Crimson’s subsequent three shots proved unsuccessul.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team finally got the offensive performance it was looking for at Penn on Saturday.
Having scored three goals in its first five games this season, the Crimson built off its 28 shots in the previous two contests and matched its season total with three goals against the Quakers.
But that wasn’t enough, as Penn netted four goals and defeated Harvard, 4-3, dropping the Crimson (1-5, 0-2 Ivy) for the first time in three years.
“They have a history of having high-scoring games,” co-captain Kim Goh said. “It was back and forth for a while. We were so close to getting right back in there and having a solid overtime, but it didn’t go our way [Saturday].”
Each team traded off goals in the first half, with Harvard opening the scoring.
But the Quakers (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) evened it at two at the 23:49 mark.
But Penn was able to jump ahead just 35 seconds before the break with a goal by senior midfielder Sarah Hasson. The Quakers made it 4-2 soon after the start of the second half thanks to another Hasson score.
The Crimson made a late push, with sophomore forward Noel Painter pulling Harvard to within one at 58:56, but the Crimson couldn’t find the equalizer in the final 11 minutes.
“We were just thinking to create opportunities in the circle, especially on short corners,” Painter said. “We were just trying to push forward and have an attack mentality. We had a lot of chances, but we unfortunately weren’t able to score in time.”
Ten minutes into the game, Crimson senior forward Emma Keller scored the first of the seven goals on the day, with sophomore Sydney Jenkins earning the assist.
Penn responded eight minutes later when Quaker freshman Elizabeth Hitti beat junior goalie Jenn Hatfield. Hatfield finished with three saves on the day.
Harvard regained the edge when sophomore forward Kaitlyn Boudah scored on a penalty corner, but the Quakers made it a tie game once again just 131 seconds later, also on a penalty-corner goal.
It looked as if both teams would enter halftime with two goals, but Penn  broke the deadlock before the break and then followed up with another score early in the second to take a 4-2 lead.
“The last minute of the first half and the second half, we were [trying] to refocus a little bit and try to regain the momentum in our favor,” Painter said. “We weren’t able to, but we gave it a shot.”
With the game winding down and the Crimson making a push, Painter put one past Quaker goalkeeper Carly Sokach after dribbling the ball up to the circle and firing a shot into the left corner of the net. The goal marked the second time in the contest—and, according to Painter, the second time this season—that the Crimson scored in field play.
But Harvard couldn’t find the back of the net in the remaining 11 minutes, and, despite outshooting the Quakers, 12-7, the Crimson fell, 4-3.
“We gave a lot; it shows sort of in the score,” Goh said. “Seven goals in a game is pretty uncommon. We definitely got it down there, and we needed one more to keep us in there, but we weren’t able in the last couple seconds.”
Harvard had its best offensive production Saturday against the Quakers but also gave up the most goals against this season as well. The team will look to make the necessary adjustments in future contests.
“Playing 70 minutes doesn’t mean going all out for 70 minutes,” Goh said. “It means playing smart for 70 minutes, so we’re focusing more on that.... We’re trying to move forward and get a better outcome hopefully on Monday against Bryant.”

On Sunday night hundreds of people gathered near Weeks footbridge on the banks of the Charles River for the 9th annual Revels RiverSing celebration. Filled with music, poetry, and communal singing, this celebration of the fall equinox waved goodbye to summer and ushered in a new and spirited fall season. The poem below was inspired by the upbeat melodies and soaring voices of RiverSing; it is composed entirely from poetic lines and lyrics that emerged throughout the event.
Now I Walk in Beauty
I stretch my green ribbon over
seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness.
I cry over beautiful things knowing no beautiful thing lasts.
Rock me, Lord, rock me, Lord, calm and easy.
I was born in the path of the winter wind
blowing sparkling sands of diamond deserts.
Who shall wear the starry crown?
Good Lord, show me the way.
Noah built the ark outa hickory bark.
This old world's gonna reel and rock.
I ain't gonna study war no more.
This train is bound for glory.
When the shadows of this life have grown,
sing to her history, sing to her timelessness.
Ever moving, and winding and free
like Jordan's river, deep and wide.
