After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students have called upon Harvard University to create a multicultural center for just over 50 years now — to no avail. In fact, the Harvard-Radcliffe Afro-American Cultural Center opened up in 1969 only to close five years later after receiving zero funding from the University. With the largest endowment of any university currently sitting at $40.9 billion, Harvard definitely has the ability to afford funding a multicultural center. It’s not as if the university doesn’t like to spend its capital either; the chairs out in Harvard Yard alone cost nearly $800 each. However, when a cohort of student groups submitted a proposal to then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III in 1995, the dean responded: “It would be inconsistent with [Harvard's] purpose to set aside space for racial, ethnic and cultural groups. Third-world or multicultural centers promote racial separation.” This couldn’t be further from the truth.
Harvard has acknowledged the importance of diversity in its imperfect race-conscious admissions process and Judge Allison D. Burroughs agreed in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard court ruling. She defended the benefits of diversity, stating, “Diversity will foster the tolerance, acceptance and understanding that will ultimately make race conscious admissions obsolete.” But on campus, diversity feels very superficial. The College flaunts its diversity on its website, taking pride in the fact that there are “more than fifty cultural, ethnic, and international student organizations.” Yet some of these organizations and cultural affinity groups are literally hidden underground in the basements of Harvard’s freshman dormitories.
The hypocritical nature of Harvard’s attitude towards diversity has to change. It’s time for Harvard to stop placing cultural affinity groups underground while broadly displaying diversity everywhere but the school itself.
The natural question is: Why do we even need a multicultural center? Imagine putting yourself into the shoes of a multiethnic boy during his freshman year at Harvard. This boy has often felt isolated or excluded from communities in his life due to his very mixed and diverse background of being African American, Indian, and Korean. He looks ethnically ambiguous and has a difficult time fitting in at Harvard. Despite efforts to find community — whether it be joining the Black Men’s Forum or the Korean Association — he continues to feel out of place, like he doesn’t fully belong in any one community. He feels the lack of a common space that others find in predominantly white finals clubs funded by predominantly white alumni.
Now, this isn’t just one random case. This is a very real experience that many Harvard students feel. In fact, that multiethnic boy you were just picturing is me.
We need a multicultural center now more than ever. Harvard should have taken the initiative to fund this center long ago when Yale, Princeton, and Brown built culturally distinct centers for its student body nearly 50 years ago. We are all familiar with the adage, “it’s better late than never.” But now Harvard is 60 years late and it’s time to enact real change. Students have been adamant about the need for a multicultural center, yet our voices remain unheard and we continue to be denied. Last year, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said, “Harvard is carefully considering a multicultural center and is making sure to consult all affected affiliates… We don’t want to just rush into something without making sure that we really brought everybody along and everybody’s had a chance to participate in what way feels right to them.” It has been over 50 years. Since the need for a multicultural center is not a priority for the administration, we need to reinvigorate the student body on this issue.
We need to reanimate the student body enough that the administration can finally listen to us. Yet even students who try to organize events to bring people from different backgrounds together still encounter the same problem of lacking a space. I myself have struggled to book a space for a concert event I’m hosting to demonstrate the need for a multicultural center. Ironically enough, this in and of itself actually proves the point that there is a lack of a common space for minority students and a need for a multicultural center at Harvard.
Students of color have left the basement. We are standing in front of the Harvard administration, waiting to be heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years, some of our most daunting challenges have gone unaddressed. The very institutions that are supposed to represent us have withered and are seen, at least by marginalized groups, as untrustworthy, or simply a joke. This malaise has led to a proliferation of political movements for change: These movements have called for a political revolution, or big, structural change, or even the outright abolition of traditionally prominent governing institutions.
If you didn’t click the links above, go back and check them now. (Or just take my word for it). Half of them are about national news, and the rest have to do with goings-on on our own campus. The parallels — our collective discontent, our disenchantment with the process meant to bring about change, our readiness to throw it all out and start again — are striking. If you ask members of the Harvard community, which leans heavily left, many will express genuine enthusiasm for these deep structural calls for reform on the national scene.
So why, when it comes to Harvard’s own campus, are we entangled in the same kinds of seemingly intractable structural problems? If our shared methodological belief about systemic structural problems is that their solutions require fundamental transformations of the systems that perpetuate them, how come some University administrators support some form of universal healthcare coverage, but not genuinely accessible mental healthcare for all University affiliates?
One relatively simple answer is that, while such initiatives might be popular, they do not have the support of University administration. But this explanation demands interrogation: Why don’t they? Does it just so happen that the relatively smaller number of people on our campus whose worldview sees progress as incremental and is skeptical of structural change all occupy leadership roles in the administration? If so, this would be a notable statistical anomaly, unless candidates for leadership were selected with that view in mind.
And that selection process, if it occurred, would not in and of itself be indefensible. Incremental theories of progress are intellectually legitimate. If the University’s leadership sees its collective worldview as starkly opposed to that of a large portion of its students and faculty on this core methodological question of how organizations and societies improve themselves, that seems like an important conversation we should be having together as a community.
But, in the absence of such a conversation, I’m doubtful that, coincidentally, everyone in the administration is skeptical of big, structural change in the abstract. It seems more likely that, for national issues, many leaders of the University are sympathetic to political movements that seek to solve major societal problems like income inequality or inadequate healthcare coverage with sweeping governmental action. But that sort of belief has not translated — for the most part — to concrete action to transform the circumstances that perpetuate our biggest on-campus concerns.
For instance, a task force commissioned by the University acknowledges that financial insecurity plays a serious role in perpetuating mental health concerns among graduate students and that undergraduates feel “perpetually overwhelmed.” But classes have gotten longer and the University and the graduate student union are at an impasse over, among other things, compensation. Not that shorter classes or a better compensation package are the only — or even, on their own, sufficient — solutions to mental health issues on campus.
But, whatever new programs the University’s mental health task force recommends, they seem unlikely to constitute a genuine cultural and structural transformation of the workload and expectations placed on students by, say, capping homework hours, or offering sufficiently generous benefits that nobody suffers from financial stresses while at Harvard. Failure to account for the structural factors at play in our biggest problems — the stress inherent in competing for high grades, prestigious extracurriculars, and ultimately, a job, or the rising cost of childcare and housing — will make any prospective reform unlikely to really succeed.
There is one notable exception to the University’s track record of not wading into the waters of structural change. Efforts to get rid of the final clubs pointed, at varying times, to a culture of exclusivity, discrimination, and sexual assault and harassment as reasons why they contributed to a toxic culture on campus. The actual efficacy of the proposal, as well as counter-proposals about how the University could better ensure that everyone found a social home on campus, matter less than that the University actually sought to transform the social institutions of undergraduate life in pursuit of a better reality for a larger number of people. And that effort offers proof-of-concept that the administration is sympathetic to methods of structural reform, though notably only in a case where the structures in question were not their own. And in implementation, even that seems to have withered into hardly any change at all.
And this brings us to the catch with big, structural change: It’s really hard. Building consensus for a particular institutional transformation, even if the idea of some transformation is popular, can be difficult. Even when you do, there’s no sure bet it’s going to work. And most of all, for leaders to even admit that it’s necessary in their own institutions requires a serious act of intellectual honesty: recognizing their institution’s role in perpetuating the system that produces the very problems they seek to solve.
For those of us who believe that enduring structural problems require enduring structural change, recognizing that fact and internalizing it as we ourselves prepare — one day — to leave Harvard and become leaders in our own right, is the first step to achieving meaningful progress. Leaders of institutions become inculcated into a set of procedures, an institutional culture that works from a status quo. So, when those procedures are challenged for producing bad outcomes, whether it be income inequality, racial disparities in institutional trust, or social isolation, we have to be willing to interrogate our own deeply held beliefs and our institutional commitments if we are to see the full set of ways we can use — and change — our institutions for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Calls for a multicultural center at Harvard aren’t new. As early as the 1960s, students have poured their labor into various forms of activism: proposals, reports, task forces, committees, protests, editorials, survey responses. If there was a channel for expressing student opinion in the past half-century at Harvard, the conversation around a multicultural center no doubt made an appearance.
But apparently, 50 years isn’t long enough.
In a November interview, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said there were challenges surrounding the creation of a multicultural center and that Harvard will need to continue research before making any decisions. “I appreciate that from a student's perspective that things can seem like they take a longer time. And partly, you know, it's because constructing anything… takes time,” he said.
While we appreciate that from a current administrator’s perspective that it seems like students demands for a multicultural center ignore a time-consuming research and implementation process, we implore Khurana and other administrators to consider its history as a proposal. This is not an issue today’s students have spearheaded, nor one that has been “rushed” in any sense of the term.
It’s been over half a century, and nothing has changed. The administration has yet to announce any steps directly dedicated to the implementation of a multicultural center that promise action, preferring instead a course of nebulous rumination. Any senior administrator offering such indifference towards a multicultural center, even if the statement technically leaves the door open for such a center in the future, disheartens us as an ongoing part of that tendency to defer to simply thinking about an issue and nothing else.
Next year’s president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council — James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. White-Thorpe ’21 — have made it clear that establishing a multicultural center is a top priority for them in 2020. While these goals are admirable and laudable, the burden of achieving this goal should not be placed on any sole group or individual, but rather the University collectively. The UC at its best can only be a platform meant to represent students, springboard their concerns, and advocate for change. To place the overwhelming task of creating a multicultural center — a task that’s been in the works for half a century — on the shoulders of two individuals over the course of their one-year tenure is unreasonable. And while this task does not fall squarely on the UC, to the extent that the group represents students and that the creation of a multicultural center continues to be a student demand, we still encourage the Council to continue advocating for it.
If Khurana truly believes more time is required, we encourage him to clarify what exactly the extra time will accomplish, and to offer a programmatic schedule of fact-finding and planning that will pave the way — at long last — to an actual multicultural center. In the absence of such a program, we unfortunately cannot view this statement as anything more than a continuation of the University’s storied history of stonewalling efforts to bring a multicultural center, something many comparable institutions already have, to Harvard.
Without any clear pathway to action, Khurana’s statement seems to be yet another sign that a multicultural center isn’t coming anytime soon. Hopefully we aren’t waiting another 50 years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 2, 2019 at 12:03 a.m.
A two-alarm fire broke out Sunday afternoon in the shared Border Cafe and Harvard Global Health Institute building at 32 Church St. minutes after 1 p.m., according to a tweet by the Cambridge Fire Department.
The Cambridge Police Department diverted traffic in the nearby blocks of the surrounding area. CPD warned in a tweet at approximately 2:07 p.m. that residents should expect traffic impacts in Harvard Square during the response to the fire.
At least 40 firefighters were deployed and dealt with the fire in the exhaust duct, according to Wicked Local Cambridge.
The Cambridge Fire Department did not respond to a request for comment.
The fire originated in the kitchen exhaust system within the Border Cafe restaurant, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said.
“No injuries, but there were some traffic impacts. And, it has since been contained,” he said.
Faculty Director of the Harvard Global Health Institute Ashish Jha, who went into the HGHI office to catch up on emails, said he does not think anyone was in the office at the time of the fire. He left the building minutes before the smoke appeared.
“Around five after one, I walked out to go get a cup of coffee. And then about five minutes later, I noticed smoke,” he said. “From the distance, I thought, I don’t think it’s our office, but I walked back only to discover all of this.”
“ Just before I left my office, I did a quick walk around — not because I was worried or anything — but because I often when I’m there on weekends will just check if anyone else is there and say ‘hi,’ he added. “And there was nobody else there in the office.”
The Harvard Global Health Institute did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
Mauricio Nivera, who cooks at Border Cafe, said Border staff were working in the kitchen when the alarm sounded.
“There were lots of us in the kitchen working and we all had to get out, but I didn’t see any fire in the restaurant, only above,” Nivera said.
Border Cafe management did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
At 3:34 p.m., CPD reported in a tweet that while Mass Ave. opened again, Church Street remained closed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard reached a settlement with the National Association of the Deaf Wednesday in a 2015 lawsuit alleging that the University failed to adequately close caption its publicly accessible online video and audio content.
According to the February 2015 complaint in federal court, much of Harvard’s free online content, which includes podcasts and recorded lectures, either lacked closed captioning or such captions were “unintelligible.” The complaint argued that this deprives deaf and hard of hearing individuals of “benefits” afforded to those without disabilities. It also alleged that Harvard violated obligation of universities receiving federal funding to “provide people with disabilities equal access to their programs and activities” under the 1973 United States Rehabilitation Act.
Per the settlement reached last week, the University must take steps to improve the accessibility of content posted to its official website and associated media platforms. Harvard agreed to caption Harvard-produced content posted on or after Dec. 1, 2019 to University websites or to associated video websites. For pieces of content posted earlier, Harvard will provide captions within five business days of a specific request for captions from an individual wishing to access that content. Harvard will also provide captions for livestreams of University-wide events.
Harvard will also be expected to pay attorneys fees for the plaintiffs, which total more than $1.5 million.
Howard A. Rosenblum, NAD’s chief executive officer, said in a press release that providing closed captions is a vital part of making learning accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing.
“As Harvard learned through this lawsuit, universities and colleges are on notice that all aspects of their campus including their websites must be accessible to everyone,” he said. “Captioning video content is a basic form of access that opens up academic learning to not only deaf and hard of hearing people but the world.”
Following NAD’s initial lawsuit, Harvard filed a motion to dismiss which was denied in 2016. In 2018, Harvard filed a motion for judgment, portions of which — including an argument that Harvard websites were not “places of public accommodation” — were again denied in April 2019. Harvard and NAD engaged in settlement discussions during the months following the ruling.
University spokesperson Nate Herpich wrote in an emailed statement that the settlement aligns with other digital accessibility initiatives at Harvard, namely, the captioning previously provided for HarvardX online courses and the school’s Digital Accessibility Policy introduced in April. The Digital Accessibility Policy addressed captioning for content posted to Harvard websites.
“Harvard is pleased to confirm the amicable resolution of the lawsuit brought by the National Association for the Deaf (NAD) regarding online captioning for video and audio content. The settlement is grounded in Harvard’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging,” Herpich wrote.
“Our websites provide a wealth of opportunities for our community members to communicate and to share ideas, and we want these websites to be available to everyone who wishes to access them. This agreement with the NAD builds on the University’s longstanding work toward ensuring a campus that is accessible and welcoming,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The three-game Thanksgiving tournament in Orlando ended with a thud on Sunday night, as the Crimson languished to a 77-62 blowout loss to USC. Harvard scored just 19 points in a second half that was excruciatingly difficult to watch, outside of a few energetic concluding minutes from bench players hungry to send a message including Mason Forbes and Luka Sakota.
The Crimson fought back from what Coach Amaker characterized postgame as a “horrendous start” to momentarily take a 39-38 lead, but it upped its opponents for only the following 31 seconds before the Trojans broke away. Led by standout rookie Onyeka Okongwu’s dominant 27 points on the interior and four triples from familiar nemesis Quinton Adlesh (who nearly spoiled Harvard’s Ivy championship last season in his last shot as a Columbia senior), the Trojans were simply a team with more weapons and athleticism on both ends of the court.
In some ways, this game was a good metaphor of the Crimson’s performance in the tournament as a whole. In all three of its games (Texas A&M, No. 5 Maryland, USC), the Crimson put together stretches of brilliant team basketball against opponents with imposing physical size — the ball moved swiftly from side-to-side, kickouts were made to confident three-point shooters like Rio Haskett (who currently holds an impressive 48.3 percent clip from deep), Rob Baker, and Danilo Djuricic, and opportunities for individual prowess from X factors Noah Kirkwood, Chris Ledlum, and of course Bryce Aiken were plentiful due to strong floor spacing.
If all else failed, there was also the post-up play of Chris Lewis to rely on or Bryce hitting one of his signature deep, deep triples to put points on the board.
It was in these spurts — some longer than others — where the strong veteran cohesiveness and individual talents on the Crimson roster fully shone through to a national audience. Just take those initial 15 minutes against the Terps when Harvard led by as much as 11 as proof of the fact that the Crimson can play up against any team in this country, if not already evident.
But then there are the reminders that this team is still very much a work in progress and one that is trying to put all the puzzle pieces together. In frustrating stretches like the second half of the Trojans contest in which Harvard shot 26% from the field, the need for someone to hold a leaking ship steady and stifle the opponent’s streaky scorer, whether that be USC’s Okongwu or Maryland’s Anthony Cowan Jr., became ever so evident.
The tide felt like it turned in both of those games right around halftime, which either points to a better team playing up to par or a still-growing Harvard team trying to find a more consistent ‘counterpunch’. Especially with Seth Towns still sidelined, this team very much needs someone not named Bryce Aiken to shine through in times of adversity and be a more stable second and third option.
Of course, both losses this weekend were against teams that will likely send their star big (Terps’ Jalen Smith and USC’s Okongwu) to the NBA, in addition to wielding complementary frontcourt pieces that gave Harvard headaches on both ends of the court. Amaker experimented with various combinations of Lewis/Baker/Djuricic/Forbes/Welsh to match up against their athletic foes, but acknowledged following both games that those players were “too much for us”.
If Harvard is unlikely to see that type of interior talent in the Ivy League, this weekend at least was fruitful in providing a competitive environment to go head-to-head with some of the best bigs college basketball had to offer. For a program that typically schedules two or at-most three Power Five teams per season, this tournament offered a platform with not only the television eyeballs but the postseason-like feeling of a back-to-back, high-gear atmosphere even sunny Orlando on break cannot diminish. Plus there are the little things, such as having an abbreviated 25-minute warmup and a raucously hostile environment (against Maryland) that may come in handy come March.
The Crimson do not come back to Boston with three wins, but in some ways have achieved a consolatory alternative: examples on the court to show it can compete toe-to-toe with brand-name Power Five schools, and ample evidence that more work needs to be done to tie its talented pieces together into a dangerous force come Ivy League play.
Its next test, against a massively-improved UMass team on Saturday, will be an important opportunity to continue what it has built in Orlando. If the adrenaline rush of playing a nationally-ranked team this weekend wasn’t enough, the intensity of this in-state rivalry should surely suffice.

In a double-overtime thriller, No. 24/25 Yale defeated Harvard in the 136th rendition of The Game, 50-43. With the victory, the Bulldogs claimed a half-share of the Ivy League title, sharing the crown with Dartmouth. En route to earn the victory, Yale (9-1, 6-1 Ivy) overcame a 19-point deficit, with 17 consecutive points in the fourth quarter alone.
Yale was first to invigorate its fans with a three-point boot in the first drive of the contest. Harvard's record-holding kicker, Jake McIntyre, countered with a 28-yarder of his own on Harvard's first offensive attempt.
Harvard had taken a quick, commanding lead of the contest by the conclusion of the first half. A pass from junior quarterback Jake Smith to B.J. Watson accounted for The Game's first touchdown. Freshman running back Aidan Borguet scored next. The first-year, on his first run of the afternoon, took the give 47 yards.
Going into halftime, the Crimson led the home team, 15-3.

Yale's Director of Athletics, Victoria M. Chun, honors her Harvard counterpart, Bob Scalise, with a piece of the original Yale Bowl. Scalise is set to retire following the conclusion of this academic year.
As halftime drew to a close, a group of protestors stormed the field initially from the Harvard student section and gathered at the center of the turf. As the protest wore on, the demonstrators were joined by other members of the crowd. The protestors held up signs and chanted, urging both universities to divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt. The protest lasted for about half-an-hour and concluded with security walking out protestors.
Harvard opened in much the same way it had left off. Borguet sprinted 59 yards for a Harvard score, pushing the score to 22-3 — Harvard's largest lead of the contest.
Yale senior quarterback Kurt Rawlings came alive in the third quarter, completing long passes and sprinting around the Harvard defense as he had done to other opponents all season. Prior to the contest, Rawlings led the division in passing efficiency, touchdowns, yardage, and average yards per game. By the end of the third quarter, Harvard led only 29-19.
Borguet scored again, this time on a 67-yard sprint down the visiting sideline to extend the lead to 17 points.
A field goal and touchdown drive that featured seven completed passes by Rawlings set up a Bulldog onside kick with 1:28 left to play. Yale recovered the kick with less than 50-yards between the home team and a tie game.
Both teams scored in the first overtime. Without lights and the extended gameplay due to the protest, the two teams played the second overtime in near darkness. Taking the ball first, Yale scored in three plays on a four-yard touchdown run from running back Zane Dudek. Harvard failed to convert, losing the contest.
