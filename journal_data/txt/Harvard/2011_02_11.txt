After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Korean filmmaker Hong Sangsoo does not like the term ‘auteur.’ Yet the most natural thing to associate with him when he describes his ‘process’—he doesn’t think that’s a good word either—is precisely that. He first comes up with a short film treatment—in his most recent works as short as three pages—and decides where to film. Then, before any substantial screenwriting has been done, he gathers the actors and gets to know them with the intention of fitting the script to the characters he grasps in them. Every morning before filming begins, he writes the script for the day, inspired in part by the setting, though always keeping in mind the thought that sparked the film in the first place.
The Harvard Film Archive in conjunction with the Korea Institute presented a retrospective of Hong’s work for the past two weekends, and Hong himself had flown in to Boston to attend various question-and-answer sessions around campus from Friday through Saturday. Over the two days, I had the opportunity to see a few of his films, attend several in-person events, and even talk with him privately. The Hong that emerged, when I immersed myself intensely in his work and in him as an artist, was simply a citizen of humanity—but one who is extraordinary in his curiosity about his world and exemplary in his revelry in the mundane glory of everyday.
True to his eminent sense of wonder, Hong takes his filmmaking as a platform for discovery rather than one for an ulterior intent, or even for an artistic message. “Some things I come across in every day life sparks curiosity in me,” Hong said [translation from Korean done by author]. “My films are a way for me to unravel these things.” It would be wrong to say though that Hong attempts to figure out a certain situation or even to make sense of them. His aim is not conclusion; his aim is the act of taking note. At the Q&A after the screening of “Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors,” Hong said, “I want to stay around, look, discover. … As soon as you make a conclusion it becomes another lie.”
Even through the interview and the student Q&A session on Friday afternoon held by the Korea Institute, Hong’s aversion to conclusions of all kinds showed through. He responded to sweeping questions about filmmaking and the film industry simply by saying that he didn’t know, or that he wasn’t in a position to answer them. “I’m not a film critic,” Hong joked. All this is indeed not to say that he is a curmudgeonly artist just as prone to being stereotyped. When he saw my confusion, he kindly explained to me as an old friend would, “all of us have an urge to categorize everything. We feel safer when we can pinpoint what we know, because we can feel like we own it in some way.”
Hong is therefore resistant to any labels that critics put on his work. “When people say ‘art film’ there are so many things attached to it. I don’t like the nuance there,” said Hong. “I don’t want my films to be categorized. I want my films to be my films.” Nonetheless, it is tempting to call his works ‘art films,’ as tempting as it is to call Hong an auteur. “Virgin Stripped Bare,” for instance, is shot entirely in black and white (though Hong claims the choice was made because he like black-and-white photography and not in order to perpetuate any parallels with avant-garde cinema). His works feature fascinating interplays between structure and content that beg to be interpreted and analyzed as an instantiation of an ‘art film.’
Not that Hong would resent any reaction to his work. “I’m curious for any kind of response,” said Hong, and indeed, he showed a certain detachment from acclaim or criticism. This can possibly be attributed to his thought that “there isn’t anything objective. There are only conflicting subjective viewpoints.” Hong’s desire then is to constantly enlarge his own subjective viewpoint: to see the details that others would miss, to intuit the feelings others would ignore. It is a desire that translates to his filmmaking. “You’re stuck with a certain view for your entire life,” said Hong, “and only once in a while, you see things differently. I think that’s a great thing. That’s what I try to do.”
Analyzing a man who resents conclusions is arguably a reductive task. Though I had only interacted with Hong for a short time, I sensed strongly that his character was remarkably consistent with his work. His films uncover, and even outside his filmmaking, he is constantly uncovering. Maybe I can borrow the words Hong used when he was referring to how he gets to know his actors: “It’s not an analyzing process. It’s feeling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council has recently passed a unanimous resolution requesting that the City Manager draw up an ordinance on gender-neutral bathrooms. This decision was made in response to concerns from the LGBT community about harassment and accessibility. Although the Cambridge City Council was right to take such steps, we caution the University, as it moves along with the House Renewal project, to think twice before applying that ordinance here at Harvard. In fact, as the Houses are renovated in the coming years, the installation of gender-neutral bathrooms is something the University should avoid, as the risk of sexual assault is simply too high.
Obviously, the safety and comfort of transgender, intersex, and non-gender-identified students should be a priority of the utmost importance at Harvard, and we understand that gender-neutral bathrooms would add to that comfort. Because of the uncomfortable situations that naturally arise when one is forced to choose which gender-specific bathroom to enter, we respect the need for these bathrooms in the city of Cambridge.
However, there are very few transgender, intersex, and non-gender identified students at Harvard, and, if desired, they can already be housed in rooms with private en-suite bathrooms where sexual harassment or discomfort would not be an issue. Even though installing gender-neutral bathrooms at Harvard would have but a small impact on the lives of most students, the potential for increased sexual harassment is enough justification to preclude their presence en masse, and we urge the University to be sensitive to these concerns.
Additionally, a major argument for gender-neutral bathrooms is that they make it easier for parents to escort their children to the bathroom or for nurses to escort elderly patients of the opposite gender. It seems that these are considerations that hardly apply to Harvard students. With no rational need, therefore, it seems that installing these bathrooms would simply be a symbolic decision and not a practical one.
At Harvard, however, gender-neutral bathrooms would most likely create more issues than solve them. The concern of sexual assault and sexual harassment in gender-neutral bathrooms has been a past problem on college campuses considering their installation. At Brown, The Brown Spectator ran an article on gender-neutral bathrooms that stressed the worry that women would feel uncomfortable with their installation and need a “safe space” where they do not feel vulnerable to assault. We echo those concerns wholeheartedly.
Indeed, the case for gender-neutral bathrooms is by no means an open-and-shut case. The president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, Kris Mineau, agrees that gender-neutral bathrooms may do more harm than good and could possibly sacrifice the privacy, modesty, and safety of all citizens.
We have to agree with these statements. Although we live in a progressive time on a progressive campus, the issue of sexual assault and sexual harassment is still very real and should be guarded against at all costs. Gender-neutral bathrooms could provide opportunities for verbal harassment and even unwanted attention that perhaps could be avoided in gender-specific bathrooms. We understand that assault and harassment can occur anywhere; we simply believe that gender-neutral bathrooms would make it easier.
Although a great step for Cambridge, gender-neutral bathrooms would not make a real difference to student life here at Harvard. The Harvard Housing Project should not focus on their installment and rather focus on their projected goals of better privacy, electricity, plumbing, and soundproofing. These types of improvements will provide no ideological satisfaction but will better meet the needs of this community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Jersey educational budgets were hit hard in 2010, and amidst the frenzy of necessary spending cuts, there was a clear victim: foreign languages. My town’s public schools were no exception. During the debates, often expressed was the misguided view that foreign language study, at an elementary school or middle school level, is a luxury. Yet in our ever-globalizing world where the number of native English speakers is decreasing, foreign language proficiency is a necessity.
Sadly, the experience of my school district is far from unique, and national statistics are not encouraging. A 2006 study by the U.S. Department of Education found that only 31 percent of elementary schools (and only 24 percent of public elementary schools) reported offering a foreign language.  Data from 2002, cited in the same study, demonstrated that only 44 percent of American high school students are enrolled in a foreign language and, at that time, less than one percent combined study Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, Japanese, Korean, Russian or Urdu, some of the world’s most widely spoken languages.
The most common argument against the importance of foreign language is that other countries learn English. If they speak English, then speaking their native language is just a luxury. Though currently this may be the case, this assumption is largely reliant on American economic and geopolitical hegemony, which as many a news article about the rise of China can tell you, is being threatened daily. China still has many obstacles to overcome, but technology experts predict Chinese patent applications will soon overtake those from the United States. Many economists are predicting the Chinese economy will soon surpass that of America. Indeed, a recent article in Reuters quotes Simon H. Johnson, Professor of Global Economics and Management at MIT, as saying that “The age of American predominance is over. The Yuan will be the world's reserve currency within two decades.”
So what is America to do?  In his State of the Union, President Barack Obama correctly encouraged innovation as “the first step in winning the future.” Surely, this can be applied to the importance of foreign languages in public education. Math and science are crucial, but it’s time we start imagining a new model of American hegemony.  As Ken Gude, a former Center for National Security Studies policy analyst, told the Washington Times, "If the U.S., in the modern world, is going to maintain its position as a global leader it's going to have to become more conversant.”  Indeed, efforts must be made to encourage foreign language programs, particularly for younger children.  We must strive to raise a multi-lingual generation to meet the challenges of a more interconnected world.
At Harvard, the emphasis on studying abroad, the myriad of languages offered, and the foreign language requirement are important steps in the right direction. However, taking one year of foreign language or proving you got above a certain score on an SAT II language test does not necessarily make a proficient speaker.  For those of us who are not already multilingual, it is important for us, as Harvard students and as future citizens of the world, to strive to be more respectful and communicative by putting an even greater emphasis on foreign language.

Shopping week, though not unique to Harvard, is one of our school’s hallmarks. Allowing students to try before they enroll helps them discover different interests and puts pressure on professors to keep their lectures fresh and exciting.
However, having no hard data about enrollment until more than a week after classes begin is an administrative headache and can make shopping week an ordeal for students as well. Nearly every Harvard student has sat on the floor or stood in the hallway outside of a shopping week lecture because the class proved far too popular for the tiny room it was assigned. The experience is unfair for people shopping multiple classes who can't arrive early enough to get a good seat, and coordinating the eventual switch to a larger room can be difficult or confusing. Worse, a class which is scrambling to find more teaching fellows sometimes has to delay the start of sections or even scale back the number of topics it covers.
Given the complicated mess shopping week has become, it would obviously be helpful to somehow estimate enrollment, even if that means extra work on the part of students. However, the pre-term planning system implemented last fall leaves much to be desired. Many lecture halls overflowed with students during shopping week, and some, such as the popular Statistics 104, were still looking for additional teaching fellows well into the second week.
How did pre-term planning fail so dismally? Some students complained that the planning tool was difficult to use, even with a tutorial video, which may have led to inaccurate data. However, this doesn’t point to a flaw in the concept of pre-term planning, merely the implementation, and given the plethora of design classes Harvard’s Computer Science department offers, our school should certainly be able to create a more user-friendly tool shouldwere pre-term planning to be revisited next year.
A more serious impediment to the accuracy of the data resulted from the pre-term planning deadline being set in November. At that time of year, most students are drowning in a sea of midterms, problem sets and term papers, not to mention extracurricular commitments. Since they would face no repercussions for choosing classes with little forethought or even at random, it is likely that many students did not take the time necessary to carefully consider which classes they would were interested in.
To get more realistic estimates, polling would have to be done after finals, when students finally have a chance to take a break from their work and think further ahead than just the following week. Though January might be on the late side with regard to selecting teaching fellows, it certainly leaves enough time to help inform classroom assignments.
Of course, if data collected in January is too late to be useful, then another option exists for providing estimates from data outside the simple poll. The registrar can instead examine enrollment trends and Q data to more accurately predict how class sizes will change from year to year.
It seems like a no-brainer that a class with no pre-requisites, sky-high Q ratings and a low workload will probably double in size with every passing year. This phenomenon happened in recent years with classes like Digging the Glyphs and Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature. Similarly, a class that had historically low ratings but is being taught by a popular teacher for the first time will almost surely see increased enrollment, which happened with Applied Math 106 last year. A class may also shrink in size when a poorly-reviewed teacher steps in. For example, the optional intermediate physics class in electrodynamics, Physics 153, shriveled down to fewer than ten10 students this semester as even the engineering concentrators required to take it switched to an alternative course offered at MIT.
Of course, cherry-picking specific examples isn't enough evidence to provide the foundation for a highly accurate algorithm, but since the goal of pre-term planning was simply to provide an educated guess about enrollment, finding a system that can generate good estimates shouldn't take an artificial intelligence researcher more than a few weekends worth of work. An undergraduate student could easily do it as a final project for a computer science class, assuming he or she could get access to enrollment data.
Let’s hope that the registrar pursues the data-driven solution for improving pre-term planning, rather than scrapping it, or worse, implementing some sort of pre-registration system. Shopping week may not be perfect, but it’s worth preserving if we can make it better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Departing from form, Sarah Palin said something bordering on clever the other day. Reacting to the vacuous festival of bromides that was President Obama’s State of the Union address, the former Alaska governor ridiculed the speech’s signature catchphrase, “Win the Future”—the latest in a long line of infantile Obamaisms—as a “WTF moment.”
“His theme last night was WTF, winning the future,” she said. “I thought, okay, that acronym—spot on. There were a lot of WTF moments throughout that speech.” Being Sarah Palin, however, she swiftly squandered her newly-acquired linguistic momentum with a lamentable pun, calling for a “Spudnut moment” in place of Obama’s “Sputnik moment.”
Despite the breathtaking fatuity of her insinuation that the Space Race led to the collapse of the Soviet Union (and that a potato flour donut shop in Richland, WA would thus serve as the superior model for American economic renewal), Palin’s derision struck a chord, although probably not in the manner that she envisaged. In the wake of the president’s speech, the shiny new slogan “Win the Future” was smeared all over the website of Organizing for America—the president’s quiescent campaign apparatus—implying that Obama intends to wield it as his battle cry for reelection. But if the humdrum “Win the Future” is to be this year’s “Change We Can Believe In,” then the 2012 presidential campaign is going to be a long one indeed.
There was a time when the Anglophone world produced the greatest orators on Earth. The 20th century alone heard Winston Churchill pledge to fight on the beaches, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, deliver us from fear itself, Martin Luther King, Jr. pronounce that he had a dream, and Ronald Reagan demand a wall be torn down. These were giants of speechmaking whose words have stood the test of time, and it is to these masters of the spoken word that Obama is being compared when he is hailed as the greatest orator of his generation. In 2008, we were told that we had been given the Roosevelt, the Kennedy, and the King of our time. While it was always understood at the time—by the sound-minded, at least—that this historical and political assessment was slightly hyperbolic, less acknowledged has been how grossly inflated this assessment was of the sitting president’s oratorical prowess as well.
Granted, in terms of verbal delivery, Obama is perhaps without contemporary equal. He has a good voice. But in written form, his words are scarcely discernable from that of his predecessor (or a high school student). A hallmark of the oratory of Churchill, Roosevelt, King, and Reagan is that their words are as arresting on paper as they are when spoken. But the literary sophistication defining the speeches of yore is sorely lacking from the speeches of today. Words now are simpler, sentences shorter, and intellectual heft has been all but expunged. Perhaps this is more the fault of a dumbed-down political discourse that steadily coarsens with each passing generation, but the president hardly merits applause for acquiescing to this trend by catering to the lowest common denominator.
Even his most exceptional orations—invariably remembered more for their catchy slogans than any substance—lack even the most fundamental trait of originality. True, there is a proud tradition of orators lifting their best lines from other orators. But whereas Kennedy stole “Ask not what your country can do for you” from President Warren Gamaliel Harding, Obama’s inspiration for “Yes We Can” appears to have been Bob the Builder. Obviously, I am not suggesting that the president literally pilfers children’s television shows for material, but it is not exactly confidence-inspiring that his catchphrases are on a comparable reading level to those of a children’s television show.
Most damning of all, however, is Obama’s failure to produce a single noteworthy address as president. It was during his campaign that we were graced with “Yes We Can,” and it was during someone else’s campaign that we heard “The Audacity of Hope.” What have we heard since then? “If there are rain puddles in heaven, Christina is jumping in them today.” A latter-day Gettysburg Address this is not.
History determines the caliber of the speech and the speechmaker not only by the eloquence of the words themselves but also by the moment in which they were spoken. This is also how leaders are measured, which is why the greatest leaders are those who preside over crises. Churchill had World War II, Roosevelt had the Great Depression, King had the Civil Rights Movement, and Reagan had the Cold War. Then there are many great speakers that history will relegate to oblivion because they had the misfortune of speaking without a crisis to speak to. Bill Clinton and Mario Cuomo fall into this category. Barack Obama, on the other hand, presented with the greatest economic calamity of our lifetimes, had a crisis but failed to speak.

An unknown individual called 911 in Cambridge on Saturday to report that a bomb was located in the Harvard Coop cafe.
After the call was made at approximately 4:56 p.m., the Cambridge Police Department and Cambridge Fire Department responded to the scene.
“The location was sweeped [sic] ... and secured,” the police report stated.
The employee at the coffee shop, a 30-year-old male, told police that he was not aware of the bomb threat.
The coffee shop employee “does not have any reason to believe that this threat has anything to do with his operations at this coffee shop,” the report said.
The police report did not indicate whether the employee was affiliated with Harvard.
The gender of the caller was also unknown.
A bomb threat was reported in the same vicinity this past summer when an unknown female called the Citizens Bank in Harvard Square, informing the bank staff that the establishment was going to explode.
Upon hearing of the threat on July 9, Cambridge police evacuated the building at 6 JFK St.
Police also redirected traffic, and businesses in the vicinity were informed of the threat.
In that incident, Cambridge police dispatched a bomb unit to search the area for explosives.
The building was declared safe about an hour after the anonymous female called the bank.
Cambridge Police Department Spokesperson Dan Riviello told The Crimson at the time that bomb threats like the one at Citizens Bank are infrequent but investigated as a necessary precaution.

Second graders completing their math worksheets are not the only little ones doing basic arithmetic anymore: Researchers at Harvard and the MITRE Corporation have recently collaborated to develop the world’s first programmable nanoprocessor.
Researchers at the lab of Chemistry Professor Charles M. Lieber had been working on the project with engineers at MITRE, a not-for-profit organization funded by the U.S. government, for more than two years. The team succeeded in assembling tiny processors capable of performing basic arithmetic operations.
Their paper describing the revolutionary computer system, was published yesterday in the journal Nature.
“This was a very challenging project. We were building something that had never been built before using techniques that had never been used before,” said James F. Klemic, nanotechnology laboratory director at MITRE.
Assembling individual nanoscale building blocks into a system of “collaborative” behavior was difficult, according to Hao Yan, first author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher in Lieber’s lab.
In manufacturing the wires that make up the processing system, Lieber’s lab opted to chemically synthesize the structures, a “bottom-up” approach which represents a departure from the conventional method of crafting wires from blocks of silicon.
The researchers were able to program the nanowires by coating them with a metal oxide. Unlike circuits in normal electronics, which can only perform one function, these nanocircuits are multifunctional, according to co-author SungWoo Nam.
Klemic said the potential applications for this technology are immense.
“Right now controller chips are ... heavy and they’re big. There are plenty of applications where you would want to have smart devices that are smaller than that,” he said, citing surgery monitors and drug delivery devices as examples.
Shamik Das, the lead engineer in MITRE’s Nanosystems Group and chief architect of the nanoprocessor, said the opportunity to collaborate with Harvard was “productive and fruitful.”
The researchers emphasized that there was the potential for future inventions.
“The next big thing is to see whether you can take multiple nanowires, connect them together and see if they can perform more complicated processes,” Yan said.

A record number of men are rushing two of Harvard’s three fraternities this semester, according to fraternity leaders.
Over 100 men attended Sigma Chi’s first rush event last week, said Tony Huang ’12, a member of Sigma Chi’s executive committee. About 72 men signed into Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s first events, according to President Phillip J. Morris ’12.
Sororities also experienced an increase in numbers this year. Two hundred and sixty eight women rushed Harvard’s three sororities, representing the largest female rush class in the University’s history.
Unlike sororities—which require women to register with the Panhellenic Council and allow them to rush multiple sororities at the same time—fraternities conduct rush activities individually and do not formally record the names of the men who attend their meetings. As a result, the exact number of students who rushed the fraternities this semester is not available.
The master of Alpha Epsilon Pi, the third fraternity on campus, did not return repeated requests for comment.
Fraternities hold rush two times during the school year—once in the fall and once in the spring.
According to Morris, freshmen dominate both rush classes, and more sophomores rush in the spring than in the fall.
Morris said SAE likely will accept more men than usual this year, speculating that the number of bids extended could be the largest yet.
Last spring, 48 men rushed SAE and seven were accepted. This year the fraternity may extend bids to up to 15 men, Morris said, who added that the largest number of men SAE has accepted in the past is 13.
Sigma Chi is unlikely to accept a larger number of brothers, despite the exceptionally large rush class, according to Huang.
Students who attended Sigma Chi’s events acknowledged that there were a large number of people in attendance.
“I think it definitely gave a more legitimate feel to the event and made it a much more gregarious atmosphere,” said Andrew K. Cohen ’13, who attended a Sigma Chi rush event.
Morris attributed the increase in rush numbers to the collaborative efforts of both fraternities and sororities to expand the Greek presence on campus.
“I think just Greeks getting their name out has had a big effect,” Morris said.
He acknowledged that sororities seem to be growing more rapidly than fraternities, attributing the discrepancy to the smaller number of social clubs available to women on campus.
“The fraternity situation is a little bit different because there are more male social groups to compete with on campus,” Morris said.
During the fraternity rush process, which lasts about two weeks, men attend a series of events and meet-and-greets with current members. Sigma Chi does not cut anyone during rush, but SAE cuts men at various points throughout the process, according to fraternity leaders.
Ultimately each fraternity extends a small number of bids to those men they believe fit the ideals of their organizations.

Three weeks after a mandatory discussion with resident tutors about the uptick in alcohol-related admittances to University Health Services, College administrators have declined to publicly release the data on hospitalization rates.
At the Jan. 21 meeting, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and University Provost Steven E. Hyman presented statistics detailing the number of alcohol-related cases treated at UHS’s Stillman Infirmary over the past several years, Lowell tutor Marta E. Sobur said after the meeting. The number of students admitted to UHS for alcohol-related illnesses last semester nearly matched the number admitted in all of the previous year, tutors said.
But while several tutors indicated after the meeting that they thought the College planned to share the statistics with students, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said in an interview on Tuesday that it is against College policy to release the information. In an e-mailed statement, Nelson added that much of the data collected by the College, including statistics on UHS alcohol admittances, is used to inform internal policy and administrative decisions.
Yet, last winter, the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services shared the information that 102 students had been admitted in the fall of 2009 to Stillman for alcohol-related illnesses. The office also shared information on the number of annual alcohol-related admissions to Stillman stretching back several years.
At last month’s meeting, the data was presented as part of a larger discussion on how to talk to students about alcohol and safe drinking practices. Lowell tutor Van C. Tran said he believes that allowing students to see  the data could help facilitate these tutor-student conversations. However, Tran said he acknowledged that the sensitivity of the issue could contribute to the administration’s reluctance to release numbers.
“Some people have been hesitant because they think that raising the issue will actually encourage more drinking,”  Tran said. “It’s a very interesting and tricky situation to be in.”
Megan E. Fazio ’13, a Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisor, said she thought that releasing the statistics to students could send the wrong message and hinder honest discussion.
“We kind of try to avoid scare tactics,”she said.
While tutors and administrators have discussed the possible increase in unsafe drinking practices, Nelson noted that the increasing awareness of the College’s amnesty policy—a rule implemented in 2007 which allows students to bring intoxicated friends to UHS without disciplinary repercussions—could be another possible explanation for the rise.
“It’s a double-edged sword in some ways,” Nelson said. “It’s a good sign because we’re actually getting help to the people who need help, so we’re happy about that. On the other hand, it’s an indication that some people are drinking too much.”

Harvard Medical School has announced a new policy for faculty promotion to full professor positions, reducing the number of steps required for approval by about half.
Administrators hope the new procedure, announced Monday, will shorten the promotion process—which until now averaged two years or more—to approximately one year.
The policy change comes about 18 months after Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier convened a task force to trim and restructure a process that many felt was unnecessarily lengthy.
“Dean Flier, when he came [to HMS], really wanted to take a fresh perspective,” said Dean for Academic and Clinical Affairs Nancy J. Tarbell, who led the task force. “He wanted to hear concerns, and one was that the senior promotion process was taking too long.”
In the past, faculty promotions were done in a two-step process. The first step, home department or hospital candidate reviews, took about a year. Subsequently, candidates were reviewed by HMS administrators, which also required about a year.
“There was this sense that once [the process] went to the HMS office, it just kind of disappeared,” Tarbell said.
Assistant Dean for Faculty Affairs Mary C. Walsh said that the new process, which requires just a single, unified step, eliminated redundancies that existed before. For example, a new, digitized documentation system will allow evaluators to review letters of recommendation through a central portal, while previously each set of evaluators requested their own, unique set of references that were not shared with other evaluators.
“I would hope that we’re recognizing in a timely fashion the accomplishments of the most senior group of our faculty,” Walsh said.
Additionally, Flier wrote in his announcement that the new policy will allow department heads to play a larger role in faculty promotions, including testifying to evaluation committees on behalf of candidates.
There are some University-wide regulations of the senior promotion processes, Tarbell noted. For example, all schools must submit their recommendations to the University Provost’s office for final approval.
Tarbell said that, on average, about 90 faculty members are candidates for promotion each year, with a majority of those candidates eventually gaining promotion. Promotions under consideration before Monday’s announcement will be reviewed using the old system.
“Our process has always been a little different just because our faculty is so large,” Tarbell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak announced yesterday that he would not immediately step down from his post, History Professors E. Roger Owen and Serhii Plokhii were examining the nature of the Egyptian democracy movement in a discussion for Harvard faculty and graduate students.
At the beginning of the talk, entitled “The Arab Revolutions of 2011: A Historian’s Panel,” many attendees checked their smart phones and laptops for the latest news out of Cairo.
Throughout the discussion, Owen—who specializes in Middle Eastern history—emphasized the unique and transformative nature of the protests in the Arab world.
“There is a kind of existential moment going on, where [the protesters] are demonstrating themselves and saying very clearly that, ‘We are here, we don’t want to go back,’” Owen said. “This is a kind of personal liberation in Cairo and ... it has this explosive quality, this demand for freedom.”
The panel was particularly timely because of the near-simultaneous announcement that Mubarak would delegate many of his powers to current Vice President Omar Suleiman, but would not formally step down until September. Earlier in the day, sources inside Mubarak’s government had suggested that he would be resigning.
Owen said that while he was “surprised” by Mubarak’s announcement, he believed that the partial transfer of powers would satisfy some of the pro-democracy protesters.
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations teaching assistant Soha Bayoumi, whose brother was injured in the protests, said she disagreed.
“From my friends there who have been tweeting and describing the emotions, it seems like everybody is outraged,” she said. “It cannot be seen as a concession.”
In addition to presenting their own interpretations of the movement in Egypt, Owen, Plokhii, and other professors at the event discussed the uprising from a historical perspective. Plokhii, who specializes in Eastern European history, compared the current movement to the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine and 2000’s Bulldozer Revolution in Serbia.
Professor Erez Manela discussed the U.S. and the role of social networking tools in the protests.
“We are extremely lucky as historians to be able to witness what is going on in Tahrir Square, no doubt,” Owen said.
In Cairo last night, word spread that protesters were planning to march on Mubarak’s palace today. The military, which said in a statement yesterday that it is considering “what can be achieved to preserve the homeland and the gains of the Egyptian people,” may make another announcement in reaction to Mubarak’s decision to hold on to power.
But for Egyptians hoping for swift political change, Mubarak’s announcement may incite further anti-government demonstrations in the hope of his ouster.
“The people are hopeful. They are angry and frustrated because of what happened today, but they are still getting stronger and stronger. Tomorrow again we will see millions in the streets,” Bayoumi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the stories of witchcraft and wizardry in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels, the triumph of good over evil took place between the woodland creatures living in Redwall Abbey and hostile vermin invaders.
British author Brian Jacques, who died of a heart attack on Feb. 5 at age 71, brought tales of adventure to the imaginations of children throughout the world, including ones who later came to Harvard.
“Redwall was the first epic fantasy I ever read. Fantasy started with Harry Potter for some people, but I was already a fan by then,” said Benjamin P.S. Klug ’14.
Andrew R. Mooney ’14 began reading the series when he was around 6 years old after he saw his brothers read it. Although the books are aimed at children ages 9 to 12, they also appealed to some advanced, younger readers.
“Once you started reading, it was hard to put them down, especially for a kid with a wild imagination,” Mooney said.
Jacques’ style was flowery and descriptive with details ranging from extravagant feasts to beautiful landscapes. Similar to J.R.R. Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings series, Jacques created an imaginary world with original languages and legends.
“The books were vivid and somehow not weird even though they were about animals,” said Alexander P. Zimmer ’14.
Redwall was first published in 1986, and Jacques subsequently penned 21 more books in the series.
Each of Jacques’ novels is similarly structured, with several groups of characters in different situations who eventually meet at the end of the story.
Fans of the series admitted it fit a formula.
“At the time I thought it was the most amazing writing ever. I would say it’s still pretty good, but it was a bit formulaic,” Klug said.
Though Jacques is most famous for the Redwall series, he also published several other stories, including a series about the Flying Dutchman.
He first told the Redwall stories to friends and children, but later wrote them down. His former English teacher submitted them to a publisher.
The final Redwall story, “The Rogue Crew,” is scheduled to be published in May.
While The Chronicles of Narnia and the Lord of the Rings have remained timeless stories, Redwall may not live on as popularly.
“I think Redwall was a kind of thing you had to be there at the right age at the right time. A lot of people have imitated that style [of writing],” Mooney said.
Over 20 professors in the English, Comparative Literature, and Folklore and Mythology departments who were contacted by The Crimson said they had not read the Redwall series, but many acknowledged Jacques’ contribution to children’s literature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing before Édouard Manet’s “The Street Singer” at the Museum of Fine Arts, Daniel A. Gross ’13 absorbed the painting’s details, analyzing the way “shadows were painted, the different textures in different parts of the paintings, the repeated angles and repeated shapes.”
“And I drew a picture of it—a very crude picture,” he adds, above the scrawled notes he had written on the back of a handout from class.
Those notes would become a four-page draft that culminated in the final paper that awarded him a spot in Exposé Magazine, the Harvard College Writing Program’s annual journal of writing.
Gross wrote the essay for his Expository Writing 20 section, “Re-Discovering the Impressionists,” which, like the broader program, uses a system of workshopping student essays. But Gross says that the techniques he used to write and revise his award-winning essay were largely introspective.
“In general, I didn’t find the processes or workshopping or talking one-on-one as helpful as systematically reexamining my own writing,” he says.
The Standing Committee on Writing and Speaking has, at least in part, recognized this concern on the part of students. It is currently in the process of evaluating how effectively Expos 20 fosters the growth of talented writers like Gross.
For the Class of 2016, the Expository Writing Program hopes to roll out a new course—Expos 30—for advanced writers. The program also plans to establish a revised expository writing placement exam, which is planned to be implemented for the Class of 2015.
Currently drafting a report that evaluates Expos 10, the committee will proceed to examine Expos 20 in a subsequent report.
Interviews with students like Gross—highly talented writers who say that they have passed through the program without having significantly gained from the experience—indicate that, if administrators wish to address the needs of students, they may need to substantively alter the introductory writing program.
THE EXPOS 20 EXPERIENCE
Unlike Expository Writing 10, which students nearly uniformly praised, Expos 20 has received far less acclaim and students offer mixed reviews of the more advanced course.
While Stephanie N. Regan ’13 says that she enjoyed Expos 10, Expos 20 did not live up to her expectations. “Expos 20 was just one of those classes that you had to get through,” she says.
Regan says that she was disappointed with her Expos 20 section on American sports culture, a topic that she says she loves. But the section presented the material in a way she describes as “crude.”
“Expos 20 was just a check-in to see if you can write,” she says. “When your essays were acceptable, they kind of just said, ‘here’s your grade.’”
But Jane Rosenzweig, director of Harvard College’s writing center, says she thinks some students are dissatisfied with Expos 20 because it does not live up to their expectations of what a writing course should be.
Expos 20, Rosenzweig says, was never designed to be a course to improve students’ style of prose. Rather, the course is meant to teach students the method of academic argument.
And in a mere 12 weeks, Rosenzweig says that it is difficult to incorporate instruction in both prose and argumentation, even if students come into the course with the expectation that it will focus on prose.
“The balance in one semester may not be enough towards prose style to suit [some students],” Rosenzweig says.
“We’ve got three essays and twelve weeks,” she says. “We just can’t do that.”
EXPOS 30
Students also criticize Expos 20 for bringing together students of dramatically varying writing abilities.
“In Expos 20, they had those specialty writers who were always going to have those answers,” says Regan. “It didn’t matter if anyone else pitched in because those who were experts at writing knew the answers they were looking for.”
As a result, Regan says she thinks the class remains an unequal plane—even for students like her who graduated from Expos 10.
“There are just brilliant writers at Harvard,” she says. “And there were quite a few people in my class that didn’t need to be there.”
For these writers, the Standing Committee on Writing and Speaking has moved to recommend establishing a new course, Expos 30.
Thomas R. Jehn, director of the Harvard College Writing Program, says the course, if established, will serve “the very, very top” writers at Harvard.
“The most skilled mathematicians go into Math 55 or higher, but all of our writers go into Expos 20,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris says.
But Expos 20 preceptor Joaquín S. Terrones says he thinks part of the strength of the class is the students’ diversity of writing abilities.
“It prepares students for the realities of what a lot of their academic life is going to be, which is having a dialogue not just with students in their concentration, but with students and professors across the university,” he says.
Gross says he would be hesitant to endorse Expos 30 due to the potential limitations of such a placement test.
“I like being in the class with everyone rather than people who are picked from a possibly inadequate placement system,” says Gross, who also agreed on the advantage of having a diverse group of “minds and skills” in the class.
TESTING INTO 20
But in order to find the talented writers, the expository writing program plans to roll out a new placement exam for the Class of 2015.
The current exam, which takes place over two hours, prompts incoming freshmen to respond to a passage by calling on “evidence of your own observations and knowledge, whether from personal experiences, current or past events, or from your reading” in two hours or less.
“[An ideal placement test] should be an experience of rigor, and there should be gravitas to it,” Jehn says.
Jehn says the redesigned exam will allot more time—perhaps 72 hours—for students to complete their essays and that it will place greater emphasis on responding to a text instead of prompting students to draw on a broad selection of personal experiences and knowledge.
The new test would ask students to compose an essay based on a smaller selection of evidence and would be more similar to the work done within the Expos program.
“I like the idea of having to take some time to reflect on the reading that you’re doing and having to take some time writing the piece,” Jehn says. “Obviously 72 hours is still only 72 hours, but that gets you more of a taste of what’s to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing three of its top players from a team that finished the 2009-10 season 5-16, few could have expected the Harvard men’s volleyball team to have much success this season.
But through five games, the Crimson has gone 4-1—marking its best start since the 2004-05 season. And after picking up just five wins all of last season, Harvard could match that total as soon as this Saturday when the squad hosts Stevens.
Crucial to the team’s success has been the play of its rookie class.  Harvard coach Brian Baise was not afraid to throw his latest crop of newcomers into the action—starting four rookies in the Crimson’s season opener against Newbury.
The freshmen did not disappoint, combining for 23 of Harvard’s 42 kills and 12 of the team’s 22 digs. And the newcomers have not looked back, totaling 145 kills. In the Crimson’s most recent matchup—a 3-1 win over Rivier—the four freshmen totaled 31 kills.
Outside hitter Chris Gibbons led the way, notching 14 kills—tying him with junior co-captain Matt Jones for the team high. On the season, Gibbons leads the Crimson in digs with 27 and sits in second in kills with 52. Meanwhile, Gibbons’ classmate Kyle Rehkemper leads Harvard in attack percentage at .338.
The Crimson’s newcomers will look to power the squad to another victory this Saturday when Harvard hosts Stevens at the Malkin Athletic Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the race for the Ivy League championship reaching its midpoint this weekend, each member of the Ancient Eight is beginning to show its personality. At this stage, teams adopt a certain character—much like how bars and pubs craft an identity—that becomes the hallmark of their season. As almost half the conference schedule has elapsed, the time for a power ranking has come, and, in the spirit of spirits, each team is paired with its Cambridge bar doppelganger.
Starting at the bottom, Dartmouth and Cornell are sharing a scorpion bowl at the Hong Kong. The last time I went to the Kong, my coat was stolen. The time before, a person at the table next to me threw up and ran away. His friend slipped in the pile of puke, bumped into the emergency exit, and set off the alarm. Yup, pretty much sums up Dartmouth and Cornell.
Next on the list, Brown is drinking alone at Grendel’s Den. Grendel’s isn’t a bad time, and the Bears aren’t a bad team; certainly they’re capable of springing an upset on a superior squad. But both Grendel’s and Brown have a pretty low ceiling. Grendel’s peak is a mellow vibe; the Bears are, at best, a spoiler. Don’t expect much excitement from either.
Climbing out of the cellar, we head to Border Café where we find Columbia. The Lions are a bit of a niche team. Noruwa Agho and Brian Barbour offer great guard play, but if those two aren’t clicking, Columbia doesn’t have much going for it. So too, Border is great if you’re looking for margaritas or mixed drinks, but it’s not necessarily a go-to hang out. Nonetheless, the Lions and Border are solid, and neither should be overlooked.
Outside the first tier of Ivy teams and Cambridge bars, Yale and Penn sit together in a booth at the Queen’s Head Pub. Though maybe not the sexiest option, Queen’s Head is cheap, has games, and draws a good demographic. Of course, it’s relatively tame, so it can’t reach the exciting highs of its peers, but the Pub is still a reliably good time. Similarly, the Bulldogs and the Quakers may not have the firepower to compete for the league title over the course of a season, but both can challenge the best teams on any night.
I’m going a little off the map as we crack into the top two. Nestled in the heart of Central Square, the Cantab Lounge is the watering hole for Harvard. Why? Because the Crimson is the youngest team in the league, and the Cantab is the most kid-friendly establishment in Cambridge. The Crimson’s biggest question mark is its youth, and, while that might not matter to the bouncers outside the Cantab, it prevents Harvard from being the title favorite.
That distinction belongs to league-leading Princeton, which patronizes Tommy Doyle’s. Love it or hate it, Tommy’s is the closest Harvard Square comes to a college bar. Likewise, the Tigers might be maddening—eking out close wins at home—but until the preseason favorites are knocked off, they rightfully sit at the top.
YALE (11-9, 4-2 Ivy) at HARVARD (16-4, 5-1 Ivy)
In terms of the league title race, this game is the most important contest on tap for the weekend. It also brings perhaps the best mano-a-mano matchup the Ivies have to offer: Keith Wright versus Greg Mangano. The two big men are the best post players in the league (with apologies to Jack Eggleston of Penn, who’s not a traditional back-to-the-basket forward). Mangano is putting up 15.1 points and 10.0 rebounds per game, and Wright is averaging 15.3 and 8.4.
I expect the showdown on the blocks to be closer than the game itself. Harvard is the deeper, more talented team, and should extend its winning streak over the Bulldogs to four in a row.
Pick: Harvard 74, Yale 64
BROWN (8-12, 1-5 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (5-15, 1-5 Ivy)
Last Friday, Brown guard Sean McGonagill turned in the league’s best individual performance so far this season. The freshman went 15 of 19 from the field and six of eight from the line en route to scoring 39 points in an 87-79 win over Columbia. Naturally, the next night McGonagill shot four for 16, and the Bears handed Cornell its first league win.
Dartmouth is looking to follow the Big Red’s lead in this game—its best chance to pick up a win for the rest of its schedule. But I see streaky Brown playing well enough to win in Hanover.
Pick: Brown 73, Dartmouth 68
PRINCETON (17-4, 5-1 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (12-8, 3-3 Ivy)
Princeton has so many Waspy look-alikes that it’s hard to tell who’s beating you. Actually, I think that’s the key to their revered offense: send out a bunch of identical players so that the other team doesn’t know who to match up with. Last Friday, Ian Hummer apparently scored 17 points, but, really, it could have been any sort-of-tall white kid with short brown hair. I’m assuming the official scorer was as confused as I was.
Given the Tigers’ proclivity for playing close games, this matchup—Princeton’s first in-conference road contest—has some upset potential, but the odds are the Tigers edge Columbia.
Pick: Princeton 74, Columbia 69
PENN (9-10, 3-2 Ivy) at CORNELL (5-15, 1-5 Ivy)
Penn is rewriting the standard for heartbreaking losses. Take the final 16 seconds of last Tuesday’s game at Princeton. Leading by one with the ball, Eggleston got T’ed up for calling a timeout that Penn didn’t have.  Then, with the score tied, Miles Cartwright turned over the inbound pass and fouled Hummer. To cap it off, Fran Dougherty missed a wide-open layup with six seconds left that would have forced double overtime.
The Quakers need a win to erase the sting of their last two games (last Saturday, they blew a three-point lead in double overtime to Harvard), and they should be able to get it over Cornell.
Pick: Penn 68, Cornell 63
YALE at DARTMOUTH
The Big Green should be no obstacle for Yale tomorrow night. Dartmouth stuck around with Princeton for a half last weekend, and it gave Harvard a scare earlier in the season, but until the Big Green plays a complete game, I’ll stick with picking against them.
Pick: Yale 68, Dartmouth 59
PRINCETON at CORNELL
Cornell got off the schneid last weekend with its win over Brown. Maybe it can have a Penn-circa-2010 turnaround and start racking up some league wins now. Unlikely, but this Big Red team has enough talent to challenge Princeton and force the Tigers to play well in order to win. I expect they will.
Pick: Princeton 73, Cornell 67
PENN at COLUMBIA
Refereeing is a difficult job, and I’m sure the officials are doing their best, so I never really complain about the way a game is called. But Penn’s fans are not of the same opinion; they were going nuts during last weekend’s game against Harvard.
That’s fine; if you think the officiating is poor, which it certainly was, feel free to boo or whatever. But Quaker fans, really? The referees gave you two extra chances to win—first when they waved off a foul that was whistled before the buzzer, and then when they counted Zack Rosen’s shot that came after the horn sounded in overtime.  And you were booing them? Win or lose, you should’ve carried them off the court like Rudy.
Nobody likes crybabies—especially, the karma police. It will catch up with you tomorrow night.
Pick: Columbia 73, Penn 71
BROWN at HARVARD
Harvard has won 13 straight at Lavietes. If it can get by Yale, then the Crimson should roll right over Brown and on to number 15, as it closes out its penultimate home weekend of the season.
Pick: Harvard 75, Brown 63
RECORD LAST WEEK: 6-3 (To date: 12-5)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last year’s Ivy League Championships, the Harvard fencing teams came up just short of an Ivy League title. Both the men’s and women’s Crimson squads cruised past six of its Ivy foes, only to be thwarted by eventual Ivy champion Princeton.
But this year, Harvard will be looking to avenge those losses. The No. 2 men’s and No. 3 women’s Crimson squads come in as slight favorites against the No. 6 men’s and No. 4 women’s Tiger squads.
In last season’s Ivy League Championships, both squads lost to Princeton in the final round of the tournament. The Harvard men (11-2) were defeated 18-9 and the women (11-3) narrowly fell 14-13, with both squads dropping crucial points during the foil and sabre segments of the competition.
But the Crimson expects this year’s competition against Ivy foe Princeton to be much different.
“It’s always hard to make predictions,” coach Peter Brand said. “But, it’s going to come down to which team wants it the most. The men are hungry this year. They beat themselves up a bit after last year because they felt like they could have done better. My women support each other well. They are a cohesive unit and everyone knows what is at stake. I think that both my squads are ready.”
After an electric start to the season, Harvard has emerged as one of the best teams in the country. Heading into this weekend’s Ancient Eight tournament, both the men’s and women’s squads hold 11-3 records this season, with the men’s squad claiming victories against defending national champion Penn State and ranked teams Duke, Columbia, Ohio State, Penn and St. John’s.
The women’s squad similarly earned wins against defending national champion Penn State and ranked teams St. John’s and Penn.
Part of the Crimson women’s dominance this season can be attributed to the junior-freshman duo: freshman foil specialist Alexandra Kiefer, and junior sabre specialist and women’s captain Caroline Vloka.
Last year, Vloka slashed her way to a 16-2 record at the Ivy League Championships, captured the NCAA sabre title, and claimed spots on both the All-America first team and the All-Ivy League First team.
Similarly, Keifer, just halfway through her freshman year, has put together an impressive season to remain undefeated in all her bouts thus far.
“I think that Alex has become one of the top fencers in the country, and I feel that she’ll do well this coming weekend,” Brand said. “And then we have Caroline Vloka, the reigning NCAA sabre champion, and I’m certainly counting on her to perform very well. Those are the two leaders in my mind for the women’s side and I think that they are really good with spurring the others on and leading by example. If those two perform really well, I think that the others will follow suit.”
On the men’s side, the Crimson will be looking to redeem itself after a stunning collapse last season against the Tigers.
“Last year we were trounced by Princeton, especially in the epee event where we just lost badly,” Brand said. “That killed us.”
However, new additions to the epee, foil and sabre squads have brought about a significant strengthening of the Crimson team. Since last season, the men have added three freshman—sabre specialist Eric Arzoian, foil Lucas Lin and epee Michael Raynis—to shift the balance of power between the Crimson and Tigers.
“On the men’s side this year, we definitely hold an edge against Princeton,” Brand said. “Our sabre squad is much better on paper than Princeton, their epee squad is probably a bit better, so its going to have to come down to the foil squads but I think that we can beat them on the foil. So overall I’m fairly optimistic in the men’s arena. If we perform to our expectations we should have a shot at winning.”
As the hours trickle away, what is clear is that the lost festering rivalry between the Ivy League’s two dominant fencing programs only continues to intensify.
“I think it was last week or so but we heard that the Princeton coach said to a recruit that ‘We’re going to slaughter Harvard,’ which just makes him look like a villain from some kind of B-movie,” sophomore sabre Thomas Kolasa said. “But after that, we’re definitely look forward to meeting Princeton this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dorothy may not have been talking about Lavietes Pavilion when she said “there’s no place like home,” but the Harvard men’s basketball team certainly understands the sentiment.
After an exciting road trip brought the team a four-point loss at Princeton and a thrilling double-overtime one-point victory over Penn, the team returns this weekend to the comforts of Cambridge, where it is 10-0 on the season.
There the Crimson (16-4, 5-1 Ivy) will take on conference foes Yale (11-9, 4-2) and Brown (8-12, 1-5) tonight and tomorrow, respectively, with each game starting at 7 p.m.
With no Ivy League tournament, every conference game becomes vitally important, and Harvard knows it cannot take any team lightly, despite its success thus far.
“It’s going to be a big weekend for us, coming back home after taking our first loss,” said junior co-captain Oliver McNally, who hit the game-winning shot with 11 seconds remaining versus the Quakers. “They’re two tough teams.”
After Michael Sands–Yale’s captain and expected best player in 2010-2011–left the team before the start of the season, the Bulldogs were not expected to compete for a conference title this year.
But the team picked up the slack caused by Sands’ departure and, after an early victory at Boston College, has surprised many pundits this season with its play.
The Bulldogs have since given the Tigers a test at Jadwin Gymnasium–when they rallied back from a 13-point deficit with 8:15 to go before losing by four–and swept Columbia and Cornell at home last weekend.
“It’s going to be a really big game for us,” sophomore forward Kyle Casey said. “They’ve been playing very well, especially of late.”
As a team, the Bulldogs rank in the middle of the pack in nearly all statistical categories.
But the team’s success has stemmed from the improved play of three individuals–junior center Greg Mangano, sophomore guard Austin Morgan, and senior guard Porter Braswell.
After averaging just 7.5 points and 5.5 rebounds last season, Magnano has developed into one of the best players in the conference, averaging 15.1 points and a league-high 10 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game.
He will pose a tough matchup for Harvard junior co-captain Keith Wright, who is coming off a career-high 25 points versus Penn. Wright sits right above Magnano as the league’s second-leading scorer (15.3 points per game) and right behind him in rebounding (8.4 per game).
“We’re going to play [Magnano] just like we play everyone else,” sophomore forward Kyle Casey said. “Hopefully we can just disrupt his game a little bit. We’re going to play him physically and try to make savvy plays on him and get him out of his comfort zone.”
Morgan, meanwhile, has increased his scoring from 4.7 to 13.0 points per contest while shooting 45 percent from three-point range. He will provide a challenge defensively for Crimson sophomore Brandyn Curry, who leads the conference in assists per game and who is often asked to defend the opponent’s best perimeter guard. Morgan’s backcourt mate Braswell has likewise improved from his scoring 6.0 to 11.1 points this season.
“[Defending Yale’s guards] is going to be a team effort, but I also think Brandyn and I have to take pride in that they’re both good players,” McNally said. “We just have to really buckle down and stay in front of the ball and make them take tough shots.”
Like the Bulldogs, Brown has multiple players who can score, starting with freshman Sean McGonagill, who is having an impressive rookie year. The point guard wowed the league when he scored 39 points on 15-of-19 shooting in Brown’s win versus Columbia last weekend, which earned him both Ivy League Player of the Week and Rookie of the Year honors.
“That was crazy,” McNally said. “We all saw that box score. Someone who can do that–we know that’s someone we’ve got to keep a watchful eye on.”
McGonagill averages 11.7 points, to go with 5.1 assists and 4 rebounds on the season. He will be one of two Rookie of the Year candidates playing tomorrow night, along with Harvard’s Laurent Rivard, who averages 11.5 points and leads the conference in free-throw percentage.
The Bears leading scorer is senior captain Peter Sullivan, who averages 13.1 points per contest. Forward Tucker Halperin contributes 11.8 points, providing another tough matchup for the Harvard front-court of Wright and Casey, who both struggled with foul trouble last weekend versus Princeton. Senior guard Garrett Leffelman chips in 9.4 points per game after averaging 17.5 against Harvard last year.
Brown’s struggles have thus not been offensive but rather defensive. The Bears rank last in the conference in scoring defense, allowing 72.6 points per contest, and have the worst turnover margin in the Ivy.
Casey said the key to being Brown might therefore be making use of Harvard’s speed.
“We’ve just got to play as fast and as under control as we can,” the sophomore said. “We’re just going to try to play our pace...and try to speed them up.”
Harvard swept the pair twice last year. The best game of the quartet was an 82-79 overtime victory at Yale, a win in which four freshmen, led by Casey, carried the team after McNally and Jeremy Lin ’10 fouled out in regulation. The team then swept Yale and Brown by an average of 20 points at home, a feat it knows it will be hard-pressed to duplicate this weekend.
“They both pose different kinds of styles,” McNally said. “Taking both of these will definitely be a battle.”

Time for the weekend preview once again! Let’s get things started off with the most exciting action of the weekend!
The men’s basketball team has two homes games this weekend against Yale tonight at 7 p.m. and Brown tomorrow at the same time. These are two big games for Harvard, because the squad lost its first conference matchup to Princeton last weekend, 65-61. However, the men still hold a 16-4 overall record and a 5-1 conference record. Last season's pair of games between the Crimson and its Ivy League archrivals resulted in back-to-back victories for the team.
While the men are at home, the women’s basketball team takes to the road to face off against Yale and Brown tonight and tomorrow night. The women are currently on a seven-game winning streak, including four straight conference victories, boosting their season record to 13-6. Chances look good for the women to continue this streak because the squad dominated the Bulldogs and the Bears last season.
Continuing with the play against Yale, the track and field team travels to New Haven, Conn., for a meet against the Bulldogs and the Princeton Tigers. Last weekend, the women defended their title, and the men placed third in the Battle of Beantown. Both teams will be looking to improve on their second-place finishes last year to take home the title.
The wrestling team has three events this weekend, one at Boston University for the Charles Cup and two duals tomorrow afternoon against Brown and Hofstra. Harvard has beaten the Terriers in 10 of the last 15 matchups, but the Bears have won five of the last seven meetings against Harvard. Last year, the Crimson and Hofstra tied in their first meeting.
The men’s tennis squad continues its dual season this weekend with two matchups today against Davidson and Quinnipiac. Last weekend, the Crimson hit a rough patch, losing two of its three matches, but the team swept Boston University, 7-0. The team is 2-3 right now, but it seems like a good chance the Crimson will be able to pick up another win, considering the men won against Quinnipiac last year, 6-1.
Similarly, the women’s tennis squad holds a 2-2 record, but the team won’t be at .500 after this weekend with its matchup against Maryland. Play starts on Sunday at noon.
The men’s ice hockey has a matchup against Princeton tonight at 7 p.m. at the Bright Hockey Arena. Currently, the men are 4-18, which includes three losses in a row. Princeton holds a 14-8-1 record this season, but under the Crimson’s current coach, Harvard is 9-6-1 against the Tigers.
The women’s ice hockey team has two matches, one against Clarkson and another against St. Lawrence. Harvard holds a 14-5-1 record over Clarkson, but has been defeated the last three times. Last season, Harvard beat St. Lawrence, 3-0.
To wrap things up two squads hit the road for some big events. The women’s fencing team heads to Princeton, N.J. for the Ivy League Championships, and the skiing team goes to compete in the Dartmouth College Carnival. All these events should make for a very exciting weekend!

The Harvard squash program certainly has its work cut out for it this weekend.
Tomorrow, the No. 2 Yale program will take to the courts for the Crimson men and women’s final home match of the regular season.
For the No. 1 women’s squad (9-0, 5-0 Ivy), the match will be the ultimate test of skill—the women lost to the Bulldogs in a preseason scrimmage, but they’ve been unstoppable since against several top-10 opponents.
But Yale (13-0, 5-0) also sports an undefeated record this season. The match tomorrow, then, will decide the Ancient Eight crown and, most likely, the top squad in the nation.
With both teams’ rosters listing three athletes apiece in the top-10 rankings, it’s anyone’s guess as to which crew will keep its record unblemished. Bulldogs Logan Greer, Sarah Toomey, and rookie Millie Tomlinson, ranked third, fourth, and 10th in the nation, present a formidable lineup for the Harvard women. But sophomore Laura Gemmell, junior Nirasha Guruge, and senior June Tiong, at No. 1., 7, and 9, present an equally intimidating front line. On top of this, both crews carry stacked benches.
After the women’s match, the No. 6 Crimson men’s team (7-3, 3-2) will face Yale. (12-1, 5-0) Both squads have something to prove, as Harvard looks to bounce back from a 6-3 loss against Trinity and the Bulldogs look to secure their second consecutive Ivy League title.
Among a slew of talented athletes, Yale boasts the talents of No. 7 Hywel Robinson and No. 8 Kenneth Chan. Harvard has only one player making the top-10 cut: talented freshman Gary Power, who most recently toppled the previously unbeaten Bantam Parth Sharma.
The women’s match starts at 1:00 p.m., and the men’s will start soon after at 4:00. Don’t be late!

Last year, during the renovation of the room where Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904, lived in Adams House, a small red pamphlet from 1944 called "The Gold Coaster" resurfaced.
Adams House alumni decided to restart the old publication. Today, "The Gold Coaster" is being published once again, this time in the form of pixels rather than pamphlets, as an online magazine. Taking its inspiration from the original 20-page pamphlet, the magazine is filled with articles about House history as well as anecdotes from current and past students about life in Adams.
Since the new-but-old magazine went online over a week ago, it has received over fifteen hundred hits, according to Michael D. Weishan '86, the editor-in-chief.
The magazine not only allows graduates to share some of their favorite memories, but also provides a forum for current students to inform alumni. In the first edition, Lauren D. Kiel '11, former associate managing editor of The Crimson, writes about how J-term—a concept foreign to most former residents—has changed the rhythm of life at Harvard.
Weishan, like many who lived in Adams before the pool became a theater in 1993, recalled late night rendezvous in the Adams House pool. Describing memories of floating on his back in the water, looking up at the snow falling onto the brilliantly illuminated skylight, he reminisced about what he called a "magical place." Memories like these have inspired Adams House alumni to revitalize their House spirit through "The Gold Coaster," helping alumni stay connected to those golden college days.

Looking for a way to exercise that will keep you warm during the chilly Cambridge winter? Perhaps yoga is the way to go.
 
Sat Bir Singh Khalsa, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who has studied the effects of yoga on health, emphasized the physical and mental benefits of the ancient discipline.

Harvard students might be most interested in yoga’s ability to reduce stress.
"You get an immediate feeling of relaxation...and a sense of well-being when you start a yoga session," Khalsa said. "As people practice over time, [that experience] starts to turn into something more permanent—a stress coping skill."
Sound good to you? We decided to explore some of the yoga resources that Harvard and the surrounding area have to offer.
 
Khalsa emphasized that for those looking to try yoga, "the key word is 'shop.'" He advised us to try out both different styles and different teachers. 
In upcoming posts, we will sample a variety of classes in the Square so that you can get a feel for which class appeals to you and start reaping the rewards of yoga!
