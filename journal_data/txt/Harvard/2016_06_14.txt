After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part of the University’s urgent care health facility has temporarily relocated to Harvard Law School’s Pound Hall as of Monday, according to an email sent to Harvard affiliates by Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira.
The move, initially announced in April, comes as renovations to the Smith Campus Center begin in earnest. The construction, set to occur until 2018, will continue through evenings and weekends, and will occasionally trigger power cuts in locations throughout the complex.
To account for the construction, the urgent care center has been relocated to Pound Hall—the current location of the Law School’s HUHS clinic—after business hours on weekdays and 24 hours during weekends and holidays. Between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. throughout the week, the Harvard’s Smith Campus location will be open.
HUHS is expected to consolidate its locations once renovations to the Smith Campus Center are completed.
