After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s season didn’t end the way the Crimson would have liked, but three of the squad’s standouts nonetheless earned accolades for their individual performances this year.
Seniors Jeff Cohen and Kevin Vaughan were unanimously named to the All-Ivy League first team this week, while sophomore Daniel Eipp was tabbed for the second team.
2012 marked the second straight season in which the Crimson was represented by two players on the conference first team—the first time since 1979-80 it achieved that feat in back-to-back years.
Vaughan, a midfielder, is making his second consecutive appearance on that squad after being joined by Dean Gibbons ’11 last season. The tri-captain, a preseason All-Ivy first team selection, lived up to those high expectations by leading the Crimson with 19 assists. The senior also ranked third on the team with 17 goals and 36 points. Vaughan now moves on to a professional career with the Denver Outlaws, who selected him with the 14th overall pick in January’s Major League Lacrosse draft.
Cohen, an attackman, had one of the Crimson’s best individual seasons ever in 2012. The senior ranked second in the country with 3.43 goals per game and 48 scores overall, a total that included 10 hat tricks and marked the seventh-highest single-season output in Harvard history. He scored at least three goals in six straight games from Feb. 28 to March 24, recorded a season-high seven tallies in the Crimson’s March 31 win over Michigan, and registered five tallies against Holy Cross, Duke, Brown, and Dartmouth. Cohen—who finished his career as Harvard’s all-time leading scorer with 142 career goals—also paced the Ancient Eight with 56 points, while his 4.0 points per game average was good for 12th best in the nation.
Eipp’s 24 goals, 18 assists, and 42 points all ranked second on the squad. The sophomore, who was an All-Ivy honorable mention last year, finished fourth in the Ancient Eight with a 3.0 points per game average.
But despite that trio of standouts, Harvard lost its final four Ivy League contests and finished the year 6-8 overall, missing out on the conference tournament and with it the chance to play in the postseason.
Three of those late-season losses came at the hands of Princeton, Cornell, and Yale, whose players dominated the first team along with Harvard’s. Tigers goalie Tyler Fiorito won Ancient Eight Player of the Year, while Big Red attackman Matt Donovan won the league’s Rookie of the Year award. Princeton—the regular season Ivy champion—led the conference with four first team selections, while the Bulldogs had three and Cornell had two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into the 2011-12 season, the Harvard men’s track and field team boasted one of the strongest recruiting classes in the history of the Ivy League. Ranked No. 5 by Track and Field News, the squad’s rookies included some of the best young throwers, sprinters, and distance runners in the country.
And though it was experience that carried the Crimson during the regular season, Harvard’s group of talented first-years stepped up in a big way at this weekend’s Outdoor Heptagonal Championships.
Freshmen scored 46 of the men’s team’s 92.75 points at Heps, hosted at Penn’s Franklin Field. The point total was good for third place in the Ancient Eight, behind second-place Cornell and Princeton—the weekend’s heavy favorites—which finished with a whopping 183 points.
“Pretty much everybody had the best meet of their life,” freshman thrower Ben Glauser said. “The future is pretty bright for us.”
While the men’s team was buoyed by the performances of its gifted freshmen, the Crimson women had a more disappointing weekend, finishing in sixth place with 71 points. Cornell and Princeton were also at the top of the women’s team standings, finishing in first and second, respectively.
“Overall, [our women’s team] is just young,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We’re relying on a lot of freshmen and sophomores. Some of them were able to come through, and others struggled a bit more…. But I think the women’s team is on the verge of something big.”
Junior Nico Weiler, who was favored to take home the pole vault title this weekend, failed to clear the bar in each of his three attempts and finished in a three-way tie for last place in the event.
The men’s pole vault began with the bar set at a height of 4.50 meters. Weiler elected to pass until the bar was raised to 5.12 meters, a height that only Cornell’s Peter Roach was able to clear. When Weiler, who holds the school record with a 5.36-meter clearance, scratched three times, Roach became the Ivy champion.
“The pole vault is one of those crazy events where the slightest little thing can go wrong and it can undo things,” Saretsky said.
With Weiler unable to provide crucial points for the team, Harvard needed its throwers to come up big in the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw.
Luckily for the Crimson, that’s exactly what they did. Glauser and classmates Igor Liokumovich, and Dean Sullivan, as well as sophomore thrower Dustin Brode, combined for 49 points on the weekend.
Glauser had perhaps Harvard’s best individual outing at the championship meet, taking second place in both the shot put and the hammer throw. Glauser recorded a mark of 17.97 meters in the shot put and threw 59.45 meters in the hammer.
Glauser’s mark in the hammer throw, which was his personal best and ninth best in school history, was a massive 12.68 meters shorter than that of Princeton’s Conor McCullough, who is currently the national leader in the event.
“[Finishing in] first place in the hammer was not really realistic,” Glauser said. “To say that [McCullough] is a living legend would be an understatement.”
Brode, the defending outdoor Heps champion in the shot put, finished in third place in the event with a 17.39-meter hurl. Coming off his best performance of the year at last weekend’s Penn Relays, the sophomore was never able to settle down in the ring, as he fouled in four of his six attempts.
Rookie Dean Sullivan ended his first season of collegiate competition on a high note by taking home the Ivy title in the javelin. Sullivan’s throw of 63.68 meters outdistanced the second-place mark, thrown by Penn’s Karl Ingram by 1.13 meters.
On the women’s side, junior Mary Hirst turned in one of the strongest showings of her outdoor season. Hirst finished in second place in the heptathlon (a personal-best 4910 points) and the high jump (1.76 meters) to earn 16 team points for the Crimson.
“She was just crushing it,” Saretsky said.
The women’s squad’s only championship performance came from junior Shannon Watt in the discus. Watt threw 48.47 meters—over a meter farther than the second-place finisher—in the discus to earn the event win.
“It’s the nature of track and field that some things are going to go your way and others are not going to go your way,” Saretsky said. “I felt that our men and women dug deep and competed with a lot of heart, and I’m very pleased with the overall outcome.”

Tastemaker is a series in which we reserve the right to opine. This week, the Internet Blow Up.
#Whatshouldwecallme didn't stand a chance. In a year defined by what Flyby will refer to as the "Internet Blow Up," any slightly amusing online trend instantly became fodder for every blog and/or facebook status update. What once made us laugh now gives us the urge to report as spam, or at least vomit a little in our mouths and then all over our keyboards.
First, the "meme" infiltrated every listserve and event announcement. Nothing screams originality like a reused picture with a cringe-worthy joke underneath. Meme makers generally draw on a collection of pictures of Asian parents and scenes from the Harry Potter Series to create these comedic masterpieces. God forbid someone tell a joke that doesn't involve a "fun" image of a character from the Office or a Philosoraptor.
Next, we had to endure the endless onslaught of "Shit ___  Say" to the extent that it's only a matter of time before "Shit Shit Says" comes into existence. The original "Shit Girls Say" is undeniably hilarious, but by the sixth version the joke feels as overplayed as Spice Girls music at a '90s themed party. You know something has been overused when "Shit White Girls Say" has spawned "Shit White Moms Say," "Shite White Girls Say to Black Boyfriends," "Shit White Girls Say to Arabs," "Shit White Girls Say to Latinas," "Shit White Girls Say to Mexicans" (yes, these are all different videos), and "Shit White Girls Say Part 345,000,000."
Meanwhile, as we sifted through memes of Obi Wan Kenobi and "Shit My Mute Cousin Says" we also had to withstand an onslaught of new catch phrases. "Yolo!" "That's Racist!" and "Come at Me Bro!" all became part of the internet vocabulary and were added to our list of words that should be banned from conversation (unless something is indeed racist).
Take "Yolo!" signifying "You Only Live Once." Zac Efron felt so inspired by the phrase that he had it tattooed on his hand. Here at Flyby, we're not against living life to the fullest, but we'd prefer not to use a mash-up of Carpe Diem and a yogurt brand to justify our actions.
Which brings us to #whatshouldwecallme. A month ago, we'd never heard of this trend, which involves posting videos that represent a certain mood or reaction to an event. The original website has entries that made us chuckle, but before you could say "crying baby," every emotion possible had a video attached to it. To the original creator of the website, we say "Great work." But to everyone else, we ask that instead of relaying our thoughts through videos or pictures of others, maybe, just maybe, we can remember how to tell jokes to each other in person instead of typing and e-mailing them by ourselves.
