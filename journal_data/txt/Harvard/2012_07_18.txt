After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a participant in this summer’s Harvard Birthright Israel trip, I read with particular interest Sandra Korn’s recent reflections on her experiences during the very same tour (“The Illuminations of Birthright,” July 6, 2012).  I was quite surprised, though, by her assessment of the trip, and I fear that it may be misleading in several respects.
First, Korn makes several confusing omissions in her presentation of factual data and in her discussions of current events.  She writes, for example, that “Birthright gets much of its funding…from right-wing American Jews like casino magnate and Romney supporter Sheldon Adelson,” and she suggests that this helps explain why Birthright is “notorious for its role in influencing the political opinion of American Jews.”  However, while Adelson does contribute to Birthright, we must remember who founded the program before we declare it to be the product of arch-conservative sponsorship.  Birthright was established by Canadian Charles Bronfman and American Michael Steinhart.  Bronfman’s charitable activities through The Andrea and Charles Bronfman Philanthropies include sponsorship of the soon-to-be-opened Canadian Museum for Human Rights as well as major contributions to the Canadian Historica-Dominion Institute (he is its Founding Co-Chair) and the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, organizations devoted to the scholarly study and public awareness of Canadian history and culture.  Bronfman also supports a variety of philanthropic initiatives in the international Jewish community.  Aside from his numerous activities through The Steinhardt Foundation for Jewish Life, Steinhardt’s contributions include the donation of two islands and almost half a million dollars to the Wildlife Conservation Society, and as a previous chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, his moderate political views are hardly comparable to those of Sheldon Adelson.
Likewise, Korn’s recent editorial describes Israel as “a state that deports African immigrants,” implying that Israeli immigration policy is racist against non-whites.  If this were the case, how can we explain Operation Moses and Operation Solomon, two rescue initiatives in which the Israeli government evacuated over twenty thousand non-white Ethiopian Jewish refugees in the 1980’s and 1990’s, allowing them to immigrate to Israel?  What about the “Vietnamese boat people” affair of 1977, in which Israel welcomed and naturalized refugees from Vietnam who had previously been denied asylum in Hong Kong and Taiwan?  To clarify, Korn’s comment refers to the recent repatriation of illegal South Sudanese migrants.  The government of Israel gives approximately $1,300 to each adult migrant who returns voluntarily to South Sudan and $650 to each underage migrant.  (The Israeli government has also demanded that illegal Ivorian immigrants submit for compensated repatriation to the Ivory Coast before July 16th or face mandatory return; Sweden and Norway set in motion their own repatriation processes for Ivorian migrants over one year ago).  Meanwhile, Israel remains steadfast in its resolve not to repatriate immigrants from Eritrea and Sudan who arrived by way of Egypt (where refugees are not granted asylum) as they qualify for refugee status owing to the dangerous conditions in their home countries.  To this effect, Danny Ayalon, Israel’s Deputy Foreign Minister, made a statement to the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, declaring that “Eritrea has a regime described by the entire international community as a regime that does not protect human rights, and someone returning there is at risk – including risk of death.”  Israel has no interest in deporting Africans or other groups seeking asylum; it does, however, exercise its right to repatriate illegal migrants, just like countries such as the United States and Canada.
Korn writes, “we spoke to young IDF soldiers who dismissed human rights abuses against Palestinians as a forgivable consequence of a Jewish state.”  This is certainly not the attitude that I heard expressed by the Israel Defense Force soldiers with whom we spoke, all of whom were residents of Haifa, Israel’s most liberal and culturally integrated city.  In Haifa, as they explained, they had grown up and attended school alongside their Israeli-Arab friends and peers, and I found their views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to be particularly conciliatory and open-minded.
Elsewhere, Korn implies that during our visit to Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial and museum, stories of the Holocaust were used to justify the establishment of a Jewish state.  She points out that Yad Vashem’s architecture leads visitors through a dark tunnel at the end of which there is “a balcony overlooking Jerusalem” representing the “symbolic conclusion of the Jewish saga.”  However, I was not at all left with the impression that this architecture and the discussions of the Holocaust led by our tour guide were designed propagandistically to influence participants’ views on the state of Israel.  They were, quite simply, meant to illustrate the dramatic developments that make up the remarkable trajectory of modern Jewish history.
In general, to my surprise, I found that discussions of political, religious, or otherwise ideologically charged topics during our trip were characterized by respectful, humble, and laissez-faire guidance at the hands of our tour guide and trip leaders.  For example, on one particular afternoon, students participated in an activity in which our group leaders read a series of assertive statements expressing opinions regarding Jewish identity or Israeli politics.  After each statement was read, students stood up and walked to one of four demarcated spaces depending on whether they chose to “agree,” “strongly agree,” “disagree,” or “strongly disagree” with the assertion.  The trip leaders called upon one student representative from each of the four demarcated spaces in order to explain his or her opinion on the assertive statement that had just been read.  Our tour guide and trip leaders were careful not to express any of their own opinions during this activity so as to promote discussion and contemplation without influencing students’ views.  Similarly, when guides presented lessons on modern Israeli history, they would often make comments such as, “we must consider the other side.”  For example, at Israel’s Independence Hall in Tel Aviv, a guide taught us about the history of Jewish settlement in Ottoman Palestine in the early 20th century.  He made us aware of the fact that Zionist settlers acquired land through legal purchase, but he also pointed out the need to sympathize with local Palestinians who felt anxiety over the gradual transfer of land to individuals whom they viewed as newcomers.
I will not deny that prior to my own participation in Birthright, I had expected the program to involve irritatingly biased and propagandistically right-wing accounts of Israeli history and politics.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, to find that these expectations were inaccurate, and I laud Birthright Israel and our guide and group leaders for the tour’s general tendency towards moderation and evenhandedness.  I would urge members of the Harvard community to visit Israel and other destinations in the Middle East with an open mind, drawing their own conclusions about the many difficult and complicated struggles faced by the inhabitants of the region.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a going-away party for an openly gay College administrator last month, Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 came to a disturbing realization: Seven prominent faculty members, administrators, and staff who identify as gay or lesbian have left the University in the last two years.
Openly gay undergraduate chaplain Jonathan C. Page ’02 left Memorial Church in the summer of 2010.
In the spring of 2011, Susan B. Marine, an openly lesbian College administrator who served as assistant dean of student life and the director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, announced her resignation.
Last summer, Paul J. McLoughlin, who is openly gay, stepped down from his post as senior adviser to the Dean of the College.
Openly gay History and Literature lecturer Ian K. Lekus left the University at the end of last summer when his teaching contract expired.
After 21 years at Harvard, Bradley S. Epps, director of undergraduate studies in Romance studies and director of graduate studies in women, gender, and sexuality, who identifies as queer, will not return in the fall.
Neither will openly gay Divinity School professor Mark D. Jordan, whose work focuses on ethics, Christianity, and sexuality.
And this August, Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh, who is openly gay, will leave University Hall.
“I kind of woke up the next day [after McIntosh’s going-away party] and thought, ‘Wow, we've lost a lot of folks,’” said McCarthy, who is openly gay. “These aren't just people who happen to be gay or lesbian—they were incredibly visible, incredibly dedicated, incredibly talented, and incredibly important to the University.”
That day, June 20, McCarthy posted a status update on his Facebook account that listed the many departures.
”This queer exodus is a terrible thing for Harvard, its students, and its intellectual, political, and moral orientation,” McCarthy wrote.
Eight of McCarthy’s Facebook friends, including several of the gay and lesbian administrators he had named, posted comments on his status update that expressed concern or frustration.
Two of those former administrators who commented on McCarthy’s post, Marine and McLoughlin, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article. Epps, also a participant in the Facebook discussion, declined to be interviewed for this article.
But interviews with five of the participants in the Facebook discussion and others largely suggest that as Harvard’s first-ever permanent director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer student life starts work this week, all is not well according to gay and lesbian employees at Harvard.
Vanidy “Van” Bailey–who was tapped for the position last month after the original appointee, Lee Forest, turned it down just days before she was supposed to start last fall–is charged with becoming the face of a community that has recently lost many of its most prominent leaders.
Current and former Harvard employees say that these departures are compounded by the University’s shortcomings in promoting the academic discipline of LGBTQ studies. They predict that the LGBTQ campus community may suffer if Harvard does not actively recruit LGBTQ faculty members and administrators to replace the ones who have left.
“This was not meant to imply some grand conspiracy about Harvard's support for LGBTQ faculty members or staff or LGBTQ studies,” McCarthy said of his Facebook post. “My concern here is that we've lost these people, and so far we haven't replaced any of them with folks that are similarly equipped to do the work that they did for LGBTQ students and for LGBTQ studies.”
 
‘AN AFFIRMING PLACE’?
Campus Pride, a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBTQ life on college campuses, gave Harvard a 4.5 rating out of five stars on its most recent LGBT-Friendly Campus Climate Index, which evaluates institutions of higher learning.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds points to this rating and recent College initiatives as evidence of Harvard’s commitment to fostering LGBTQ life on campus.
In the fall of 2010, Hammonds convened a working group to assess the undergraduate LGBTQ community’s needs. A year and a half later, that committee of administrators, faculty, and students produced a report that included five recommendations for improving resources for LGBTQ students on campus. Based on that report, Hammonds announced plans to open a new Office of BGLTQ Student Life and to hire a full-time director to oversee the office.
Those plans hit a road bump when Forest abruptly turned down the job. In her absence, Emily J. Miller, a student at the Divinity School, oversaw the grand opening of the office as interim director this past spring.
None of the gay faculty and administrators interviewed for this article said they felt personally oppressed or persecuted on campus, and several who attended the College said they thought Harvard has become a significantly better place to be gay since their undergraduate years.
“I could not have chosen a more inclusive and supportive community in which to work,” McIntosh said of his experience as a gay Harvard administrator in an email.
But Lekus said that he did not always feel supported as a gay faculty member during his three years at Harvard.
“My gut feeling is that Harvard is the gayest place I’ve ever been either as a student or a teacher, but I wouldn't ever say it's an affirming place,” Lekus said. “Given how many committed LGBTQ allies there are in the University leadership, there is a failure to translate that to direct support, continuing to hammer home the impression that we are second-class citizens of the Harvard community.”
Divinity School professor and Lowell House Co-Master Diana L. Eck, who is openly lesbian, said she has always felt valued as LGBTQ faculty member. But she said she thought more work could still be done to make Harvard a welcoming place for LGBTQ employees.
“I’m sure we can do more to support gay faculty,” Eck said. “That's something that really has to come from a broad consensus of faculty throughout the University.”
Lekus said he thinks the recent establishment of a BGLTQ director and an Office of BGLTQ Student Life was long overdue–“the sign of a campus that is a follower, not a leader” on LGBTQ issues, he said.
The University of Pennsylvania hired its first-full time director for its program for gay and lesbian faculty, staff, and students in 1989; Princeton tapped its first full-time LGBT student services coordinator in 2001; and in 2006, Yale hired a special assistant to the dean for LGBTQ affairs.
Lekus also commented on McCarthy’s Facebook post, “When it comes to queer issues, it seems clear that Harvard is ready to make a bold leap into the early 1990s.”
Page echoed Lekus’ sentiment. “There’s not that sense of Harvard standing up and saying, ‘We want to be the best, we want to be the poster child of making this a supportive place,’” he said in an interview.
 
‘NO ONE TO WORK WITH’ 
McCarthy, Lekus, and Page all said they think Harvard does not do enough to promote the academic study of LGBTQ culture and history.
In 2001, Epps and Heather K. Love ’91, then a lecturer on literature, launched an effort to push for the establishment of a committee on studies of gender and sexuality, which was incorporated in the existing women’s studies program in 2003.
Since then, professors in the renamed Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality have unsuccessfully clamored for full departmental status.
In 2009, Harvard established the F. O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality, the country’s first endowed professorship in LGBTQ studies, funded by a $1.5 million grant from the Harvard Gay & Lesbian Caucus, an organization independent of the University.
This fall, Henry Abelove, an English professor emeritus at Wesleyan University, will teach two courses as the first recipient of the professorship.
But Lekus said he was not satisfied with this effort. “You have to wonder if this visiting scholarship absolves the University of actually hiring a senior scholar permanently in LGBTQ studies,” he said.
Even history professor Nancy Cott, who teaches History 1462: “History of Sexuality in Modern West,” said she does not consider herself an expert in LGBTQ history. 
“It’s an area that I'm interested in and aware of,” said Cott. “But I would never call myself an LGBTQ specialist.” Instead, she describes herself as a historian of gender.
And though Harvard recently recruited LGBTQ scholar Michael Bronski from Dartmouth as a senior faculty member, his contract–though renewable–is not tenured.
FAS Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen, who said that she and other University leaders highly value LGBTQ scholarship, pointed to the financial crisis and the subsequent hiring slowdown in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to explain why there are not more tenured LGBTQ scholars at Harvard.
WGS lecturer Caroline Light, the program’s director of undergraduate studies, wrote in an email that “the University has been supportive of the development of our program’s LGBT track and our LGBT secondary field.” 
But McCarthy said that many WGS courses are taught by lecturers or visiting faculty members, leading to rapid turnover in the course catalog.
“You don't have courses that are offered year in and year out that would help establish LGBTQ studies as a legitimate subject of academic study at the University,” he said.
Lekus, who studies post-World War II LGBTQ movements, said he does not recommend Harvard to prospective graduate students seeking advice on where to pursue a degree in LGBTQ history.
“At least in the field of history, there would be no one to work with,” Lekus said. “It would be a waste of [graduate students’] time. It would be a waste of their money.”
One of the recommendations made in 2011 by the Working Group on BGLTQ Student Life called for “a thorough review of curricular offerings related to BGLTQ topics.”
Eck, who co-chaired the working group, and McCarthy, a member, both said they have yet to see any changes resulting from that recommendation.
In an emailed statement, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that the College’s first priority following the release of the recommendations was to find a director to oversee the new Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
“With those recommendations enacted, the College and the Director now have the opportunity in the coming year to focus on the report’s other recommendations,” Neal wrote.
Both Lekus and Page also said they encountered resistance to LGBTQ studies among scholars of more mainstream academic disciplines at Harvard.
“Within Harvard academic departments, there’s some degree of suspicion and perhaps a lack of respect for queer studies,” Page said.
For Lekus, promoting LGBTQ scholarship at Harvard was “just plain exhausting.”
“You’re not fighting–by and large–the open bigotry of raging homophobes,” Lekus said. “You’re fighting the quiet, don’t-rock-the-boat complacency of the people who have made it at Harvard.”
 
FILLING THE VOID
None of the departed or outgoing Harvard affiliates interviewed for this article said they left Harvard because they were dissatisfied with the University’s progress on LGBTQ issues.
“I am not concerned about the departure of a number of LGBTQ friends and colleagues,” McIntosh wrote in an email. “As I see it, these friends have had opportunities for professional advancement and have taken advantage of these opportunities.” 
However, in the Facebook discussion, McLoughlin wrote to his colleagues “continuing to fight the queer fight within the Ivy Gates” that part of his reason for leaving Harvard was that he “knew the grass had to be greener” after years of frustration. After McLoughlin was contacted by The Crimson for this article, his comment has been removed from Facebook.
And Epps commented on Facebook, “I'm leaving Harvard not just because I'm delighted with my new job in Britain but also because after 21 years of struggling to have the administration support LGBTQ Studies--beyond the generosity of the HGLC and the Open Gate--, Latino Studies, Spanish, WGS, and so much more, I found myself increasingly exhausted.... I've gotten old at Harvard and I damn well didn't, don't, want to die there with the eternal promise of ‘some day, some day.’”
Also on Facebook, Marine voiced concern about her former colleagues’ departures, writing, “I’m sad too, mostly because it takes a village of queers (and allies) to make incremental change in any institution.”
But on a more upbeat note, McIntosh wrote in his email that he took solace in the fact that “there are several new and long-standing faculty and administrators who identify as LGBTQ who are still at Harvard.”
But McCarthy, Lekus, Page, and Blaine G. Saito ’04–an openly gay proctor who left Harvard this month–all said the departures worried them.
Saito, who said he had many conversations with LGBTQ freshmen during his time as a proctor, expressed concern that students grappling with their sexual identities may find fewer prominent LGBTQ mentors.
Page agreed. “If the same thing happened with racial and ethnic minorities, I think the University would see this as a red flag,” he said.
He said he hopes the University will recruit new LGBTQ faculty and administrators to replace those who have left.
“The question is, has it gone unnoticed? If it’s gone unnoticed, then that's a problem,” he said.
Hammonds, who is lesbian and is the University’s highest-ranking official who openly identifies as LGBTQ, declined to comment on whether she had noticed a recent rash of departures of LGBTQ faculty and administrators but reiterated her commitment to promoting a vibrant LGBTQ community on campus.
“I’m pleased to hear that today’s BGLTQ students, faculty, and staff expect the College to be a welcoming and affirming community. I do too,” Hammonds wrote in an email. “That concern will be top of mind for me and all the members of my administration in our search for new leaders who can extend the improvements in the environment for BGLTQ students and allies–and for undergraduates of all backgrounds and orientations–that we’ve seen in recent years.”
But for now, Harvard’s LGBTQ community counts fewer prominent faces among its leaders.
In the Facebook discussion, Marine addressed McCarthy, the only one of the nine discussion participants who will return to Harvard this fall. “Tim - I feel I have abandoned you,” she wrote.
“I’m feeling a little lonely, quite frankly,” McCarthy said in an interview. “I feel lonelier without these people, because they’re not only trusted colleagues, but trusted friends. I feel their absence very deeply.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jody Freeman, a professor at Harvard Law School, was elected to the Board of Directors of ConocoPhillips last Tuesday. She will serve on the Public Policy Committee for the third largest integrated energy company in the United States.
Since joining the Harvard faculty in 2005, Freeman has taught administrative law and environmental law and was the founding director of the Harvard Environmental Law and Policy Program. In 2009, she took a year off to serve as Counselor on Energy and Climate Change in the Obama White House, working primarily on energy and climate change policy and playing a role in the implementation of the first-ever greenhouse gas emission standards for automobiles.
Fellow environmental law scholar Rob Verchick, a professor at Loyola University New Orleans and a HLS graduate in the class of 1989, discussed Freeman’s resume in talking about her recent appointment.
“I wasn’t surprised because she is one of the leaders in the field of thinking about the regulation of fuels and petroleum, and her work in the Obama administration I think gave her a lot of credibility in that area,” Verchick said.
The choice of Freeman comes months after complaints were raised at ConocoPhillips’ annual shareholder meeting in May that the company’s board had nine males but no women.
“Our company is strongly committed to the highest standards for health, safety and environmental stewardship,” ConocoPhillips Chairman and CEO Ryan Lance said in a statement. “Jody’s presence on the board will add a unique and valuable perspective, and help to advance our commitment to operational excellence around the world.”
Wendy B. Jacobs, the director of Harvard’s Environmental Law and Policy Clinic, expects that Freeman will add a new perspective to the Board of Directors in addition to the diversity that she brings.
“Boards need [new ideas], and this board, I’m happy to say, is open to having a broader range of perspectives,” Jacobs said.
Though her background differs from most other members of the ConocoPhillips board, Verchik said that he does not expect her views to clash with the business.
“In the area of environmental law, there are two different kinds of scholars, and some of them lean more towards advocating an environmentalist position…. I would not put Jody in that category,” Verchick said. “I’d put her in a category that business leaders see as more sympathetic.”
Verchick also said that Freeman’s selection is ahead of the normal timeline of environmental scholars.
“It is an extraordinary rise because normally you find academics in the field of environmental law on the boards of non-profits or educational public institutes,” Verchick said. “I think to see her [at] a major for-profit industry like that in the private sector is uncommon.”
Third-year law student and Managing Editor of the Harvard Environmental Law Review Brendan Selby, who learned administrative and environmental law from Freeman, said he was not worried that her new position would affect her teaching.
“I think she is very impartial as a teacher,” Selby said. “She always teaches both sides of an issue—she was never just coming at things from the environmental sides and ignoring the fairness aspect. I don’t think it will affect her ability to continue doing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say in life you don’t often get second chances. What they don’t tell you is that if you’re Daryl Morey, that’s apparently not necessarily the case.
Last Christmas Eve, the Houston Rockets' general manager cut Jeremy Lin ’10, leaving the point guard he had just claimed off waivers disenchanted and unsure whether he had a future in the game he loved.
Morey had wanted to sign center Samuel Dalembert, but had too many players for roster spots. With point guards Kyle Lowry, Goran Dragic, and Jonny Flynn already on the squad, cutting Lin was an easy way for him to solve that problem.
But thanks to a turn of events that has stunned the basketball world, Lin will walk back into the very same office where he was once considered a benchwarmer and seven months later sign a contract that will make him the face of the Rockets’ franchise.
Lin’s three year, $25.1 million dollar contract was not matched by the New York Knicks Tuesday night, news that started out as shocking but became increasingly expected as the clock ticked towards 11:59 p.m., the minute which officially marked the conclusion of the team’s three-day period it was granted to match the deal and with it the end of Linsanity at Madison Square Garden.
“Welcome to Houston @JLin7! We plan to hang on this time. You will love ‪#RedNation,” Morey tweeted Tuesday night.
It had been widely expected, if not presumed, that New York would match any offer for the restricted free agent who captivated its fan base and the nation in a startling February and March run that saw him score more points than any player in NBA history over his first five starts, land on the cover of Sports Illustrated in back-to-back weeks, and become one of the most popular athletes on the planet almost overnight.
But all that changed late Saturday night, when the Knicks reacquired Raymond Felton via a sign-and-trade, adding the former floor general of their own to a revamped group of point guards that includes the newly-signed Jason Kidd and Pablo Prigioni and all but signaling the end of Lin’s time in the Big Apple.
Just a week ago, Lin's departure seemed unthinkable, even more so after the Knicks surprisingly won a court case that granted them Lin’s early Bird Rights. The point guard was initially said to have agreed to a four year, $28.8 million dollar contract with Houston, which last Tuesday Knicks coach Mike Woodson said his team would “absolutely” match, because “Jeremy Lin has always been a big part of what we're trying to do as we move forward with our franchise.”
But all that changed when the contract Lin actually ended up signing included a far larger “poison pill” in its final season then the Knicks’ brass had expected. After making $5 million in the first year of his contract and $5.225 million in the second, the third year of Lin’s deal will pay him $14.8 million, a number that could have cost Knicks’ owner James Dolan over $45 million in luxury tax payments thanks to the league’s new collective bargaining agreement.
Whether because Dolan was unwilling to pay the tax, angry at Lin and his representation for changing the terms of the initially-agreed upon contract, or simply not a believer in Lin’s potential as a player—all of which have been rumored in the days leading up to the Knicks’ deadline—Lin is now headed back to Houston, where he will count for approximately $8 million against the Rockets salary cap all three years of the contract thanks to a loophole in the CBA that Morey exploited to his advantage.
On Tuesday night, Lin appeared happy to be headed back to Texas, tweeting “Extremely excited and honored to be a Houston Rocket again!! ‪#RedNation.”
But the startling turn of events had broken the hearts of many Knick fans who the point guard had captivated during his unforgettable run, including over 14,000 who signed a petition this week pleading the Knicks to match the offer sheet. Though some felt it was unwise for New York, with a recent history of economic imprudence, to give a contract that large to a player with such a small sample size of success, others argued it was nonsensical for the Knicks—well over the salary cap for the next three seasons anyway and possessing just one player (Iman Shumpert) younger than 25 on its roster—to let an asset with Lin’s potential walk without compensation.
On Tuesday, the former group got its wish, forcing Lin to leave a parting message to the team and the city that changed his life forever.
“Much love and thankfulness to the Knicks and New York for your support this past year...easily the best year of my life ‪#ForeverGrateful,” he tweeted.
The 23-year-old will now rejoin a Rockets team that has few established players and a wealth of young talent it is reportedly tirelessly trying to use to acquire Magic star Dwight Howard. In Houston, Lin will get to play in coach Kevin McHale’s point guard-friendly system—under which both Lowry and Dragic thrived last season—and in a city that features a large Asian fanbase thanks to former Rockets star Yao Ming.
The point guard, who also last week won the ESPY award for Best Breakthrough Athlete, becomes the second Harvard alum to receive a breakthrough payday in the past year. Last October, Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 capitalized on his own string of successes to sign a six-year, $59 million deal.
But Fitzpatrick’s signing came with far less attention from the country, as over the past few days Twitter, sports talk shows, and newspaper columns have exploded with reactions that reflected the astonishment many felt about the Knicks planning to let walk the player largely credited with saving their 2012 season.
Just like that, Lin was gone in a New York minute, his departure almost as abrupt as his arrival, when he lit up Madison Square Garden for 25 points against Deron Williams’ Nets to begin a run as unexpected it was historic.
Now, as if that had never happened, Lin is a Rocket once again, and though Lowry, Dragic, Flynn, and Dalembert are all gone, Houston may have finally found a solution to its problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A hop, skip, and a jump. An exceptional ability to do those three things in rapid succession, and over large distances, has made Samyr Laine ’06 an elite athlete. It made Laine an All-American in the triple jump in 2005, and it compelled him to defer a number of job offers from elite law firms after earning his J.D. from Georgetown.
Six years after graduating, it has landed Laine a spot in this summer’s Olympic Games. But despite his atheltics accomplishments heading into London, it is his story that makes him one of the media darlings of the upcoming Olympics.
Laine, born and raised in New York, will be representing his parents’ home nation of Haiti, and has a chance to unify a country torn apart by the devastating 2010 earthquake and the opportunity to earn the nation's first individual medal since Silvio Cator took a silver in the 1928 Amsterdam Games.
Laine has also garnered national headlines because of the man with whom he shared his Straus D-11 suite back in 2002 and 2003. Mark E. Zuckerberg, creator of Facebook—Laine was user number 14 on the site—lived with the Olympic athlete during their freshman year.
But Laine’s story, both at Harvard and elsewhere, is compelling beyond the confines of that fateful dorm room.
FALSE START
Laine, who eventually served as the co-captain of the Crimson track and field team, did not make his high school roster as a freshman at Newburgh Academy. Competing as a middle-distance runner in 7th and 8th grade, he was cut in 1998, prompting a switch to tennis.
But Michael Johnson’s performance in the 200 and 400 meters at the 2000 Sydney Olympics inspired Laine to return to the track, this time as a jumper.
“Seeing Michael Johnson doing his thing really got me back into it,” Laine said. “Since then, it’s just been hard work. I don’t want to give it up; it’s the general pursuit of excellence.”
The return proved successful. Laine became an elite high-school athlete and was recruited by a number of colleges, choosing Harvard and matriculating in the fall of 2002.
THE “THREE STOOGES”
Once with the Crimson, Laine began a collegiate career that saw him set indoor and outdoor triple jump school records.
His fellow jumpers in the class of 2006, after finishing their careers at Harvard, remain life-long friends.
“We referred to ourselves as the ‘Triumvirate’ and the ‘Three Stooges,’” said Travis Hughes ’06, a former long and triple-jumper who is now a Houston-based attorney. “Sam, Lawrence [Adjah ’06], and I became very close, which makes sense considering the fact that we ran, worked out, and jumped together every day for eight months out of the year for four years.”
Adjah and Laine were co-captains their senior year, and after graduation, both went to the University of Texas to compete as graduate students, with Laine receiving a degree in kinesiology-sports management.
“The team and support I got while I was in Austin sort of bridged the time between Harvard, Law School, and being a professional track and field athlete,” Laine said. “It really gave me the boost I need.”
In the summer after starting Law School at Washington University in St. Louis, Hughes moved out to Austin with his former teammates. In the years since Laine began his international track and field career, ‘The Three Stooges’ have been there every step of the way.
Adjah, Laine’s blockmate at Harvard, will be traveling to London to cheer Laine on.
“They’ve always been encouraging me, keeping my head high and pushing me to do better and be the best I can be,” Laine said. “As far as support goes, it doesn’t get any better than that.”
A STUDENT-ATHLETE
Laine said that his time at Harvard helped him develop the work ethic necessary to balance his studies after college at Georgetown Law School with his budding professional athletic career.
Though his primary goal is to increase visibility and provide support for Haiti, Laine sees his experience as a teaching moment for young people in America as well.
“I feel like I’m on a selfless mission. Even though I have my own aspirations, this is for the country of Haiti,” Laine said. “But even for people in the United States who feel like athletic and academic success can’t go hand-in-hand, I hope there are young people out there who see my story and no longer think that that is the case.”
Laine’s work ethic and selflessness become clear in his personal interactions. He has a self-imposed policy of personally responding to every email sent to his website. On his YouTube account, Laine responds to every comment, often giving young athletes work-out advice and handling snarky internet commenters with grace.
“His being in London is not a fluke,” Hughes said. “He’s a legit athlete, and he’s a great guy.”
HAITIAN AT HEART
Among the curiosities of Laine’s Olympic campaign is the fact that he is competing for Haiti—a nation he had never visited until he was 26.
But Laine grew up speaking Creole at home. While at Harvard, he was heavily involved with both the Caribbean Club and the Harvard-Haitian Alliance, engaging with the sizeable Haitian community in the greater Boston area.
“I would say it was more like a Haitian raised in the U.S., rather than an American choosing to compete with Haiti,” Laine said.
Throughout Laine's childhood, he added, his mother feared returning to the nation that had caused so much suffering for the family.
But after a deadly earthquake struck Haiti two years ago, Laine felt compelled to reconnect with his family's nation of origin and commit himself to improving the lives of his fellow Haitians.
“After the earthquake happened, and at 26 years old, there’s not much my mother could do,” Laine said. “As a Haitian-American, the culture has always been near and dear to me.”
Laine hopes that his Olympic pursuits will help lead to better athletic facilities in Haiti, giving children there the same opportunities he had to improve at his craft and compete internationally.
Leaving Law School as a very successful student Laine has been presented with a number of job opportunities, almost all of which would be more lucrative than what he is currently doing—an important consideration, especially because he is still paying off student loans.
“I’ve had moments of wavering commitment, but they’ve been few and far between,” Laine said. “There have been opportunities that were hard to pass up, but those will be there in the future. Right now, I have an incredible opportunity to do what I love while being able to talk about Haiti and Haitian athletics. It’s all just to inspire.”
But Laine is not just going to London to serve as a mascot for a recovering Haiti. He fully intends to compete and figures to have a shot at landing on the podium.
“I’m prepared, I’m very prepared,” Laine said. “I’m just trying to approach it like business as usual.”
When he gets to London, he will have never faced tougher competition. But Laine will have a committed group of friends, family, and a nation looking for a hero in his corner.
“I know that he’s going to do great things, not only on the track, but especially for Haiti,” Hughes said.
