After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In November 1972, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf—then an up-and-coming assistant minister of finance in Liberia—returned to her old high school to deliver a graduation speech.
As she stood before the prospective graduates of the College of West Africa, Sirleaf gave a commencement address that was both nontraditional and life altering.
“Most graduation speeches are an opportunity to look back fondly on one’s days at a school, to commend the students for their achievement and extol their academic excellence before urging them to go out and do some vague, undefined good in the world,” she later wrote in her autobiography.
“But I was not interested in that.”
In lue of a traditional commencement address, Sirleaf criticized her government’s lack of urgency and inefficiency in bringing social change to the people of Liberia.
She also warned the graduates of the consequences of increasing economic stratification, imploring the graduates to reject materialism and seek national unity.
Sirleaf—who would eventually rise to the highest political office in her war-torn nation—later described this moment in her autobiography as “an important turning point, one at which I set my feet upon a path from which there was no turning back.”
On May 26, nearly forty years after that first pivotal graduation speech at her old high school, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf will be the principal speaker at Harvard’s 360th Commencement.
BECOMING ‘MA ELLEN’
Born in Monrovia, Liberia in 1938, Sirleaf’s ascent to the presidency was never easy.
At the age of 17, she married James Sirleaf and moved with him to the United States to complete her education.
The couple would have four children and later divorced.
Sirleaf went on to earn an accounting degree from the University of Wisconsin and an economics degree from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
After returning to Liberia to work in government, Sirleaf would complete her formal education at the Harvard Kennedy School, where she was an Edward S. Mason Fellow.
Paulina Gonzalez-Pose, who is director of the Edward S. Mason Program at the Kennedy School, said she thinks Sirleaf’s government experience prepared her for the program.
“I think she came here with a very strong political knowledge,” said Gonzalez-Pose, who said she did not know Sirleaf as a student.
“She was very much somebody with a solid technical knowledge of what development entails,” she said.
Sirleaf graduated with a Masters in Public Administration from the Kennedy School in 1971.
After graduation, Sirleaf returned once again to Liberia, where she became assistant minister of finance and delivered her pivotal high school commencement speech.
She quickly rose through the ranks, but was forced to go into exile after surviving a military coup in 1980. During this period, she worked for the World Bank in Washington D.C. and Citibank in Kenya.
In 1985, Sirleaf returned to Liberia to run for vice president on a ticket that opposed the existing regime. Her ticket lost to Samuel Doe, who became president of Liberia. Later, after criticizing his regime in one of her speeches, Sirleaf was convicted of sedition and imprisoned for a month. She was later pardoned.
She would again be imprisoned—this time for eight months—in the wake of an attempted coup against the Doe regime.
Exiled during the First Liberian Civil War, Sirleaf returned to her country to run for president in 1997. She placed second in a controversial election.
She was exiled once again during the Second Liberian Civil War, but returned once again to Liberia to run for president in 2005.
This time, she was victorious, beating soccer player George Weah in a disputed run-off election.
When she took office in 2006, Sirleaf became the first elected female head of state in Africa.
During her presidency, Sirleaf has dramatically reduced Liberia’s foreign debt, cutting the foreign deficit from $4.9 billion in 2006 to $1.7 billion in 2010, according to Newsweek.
She has also established a compulsory public education program, instituted a new supreme court, and increased access to health care and nutrition.
Sirleaf is called “Ma Ellen” by some Liberians, who say that she is the beloved mother of their nation.
But Sirleaf’s presidency has not been without controversy.
In June 2009, Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission—intended to curb government corruption—recommended that Sirleaf be banned from holding public office for 30 years because she financially supported the corrupt president Charles Taylor in the first days of the First Liberian War.
In July 2009, Sirleaf apologized for her support of Taylor.
“When the true nature of Mr. Taylor’s intentions became known, there was no more impassioned critic or strong opponent to him in a democratic process,” she said in an Independence Day speech.
In late 2010, Sirleaf dissolved her entire cabinet and reassembled a new administration in the midst of allegations of corruption in the Liberian government.
A SIGNIFICANT SPEECH
The University’s selection of Sirleaf to deliver this year’s commencement address—which was announced March 10—has been well-received among faculty.
“As the first female elected head of state on the African continent, President Sirleaf has worked tirelessly to improve economic and political conditions in Liberia, and to improve the lives of all people in her country,” Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood said in a statement.
“We at the Kennedy School are very proud of her many accomplishments, and continue to support her efforts to bring about positive change in Liberia.”
Kennedy School Lecturer John W. Thomas—who met Sirleaf when she was a student at the Kennedy School and has interacted with in the years since—said he thinks Sirleaf’s selection speaks to her outstanding personal qualities.
“Here is a woman who has stepped in to try to reconstruct a truly failed state when she could be working at an investment bank,” Thomas said, referring to Sirleaf’s work at the World Bank and Citibank.
“We certainly have [had] commencement speakers with less courage and accomplishments than she has,” he said.
Thomas added that he thinks the selection of Sirleaf as commencement speaker reflects the rising prospects of Africa.
“For the first time, people are beginning to say hopeful things about Africa,” he said.
“I think she represents the kind of leadership that’s going to be necessary to try to make that happen.”
Gonzalez-Pose echoed Thomas’s sentiment.
“I think she was chosen as a strong woman and president who has managed to keep democracy and the values she believes in,” she said.
“[Sirleaf] is a symbol, something that the world needs right now.”
Gonzalez-Pose—who met Sirleaf in her most recent trip to Harvard in 2008—said she found the Liberian president to be “very accessible” and “very much down to earth.”
PREDICTIONS
Faculty predict that Sirleaf—who in 2008 delivered commencement addresses at Dartmouth College and the Kennedy School—will highlight the process of rebuilding Liberia after years of civil war in her upcoming speech.
“The central theme of her speech has got to be building a state from the ashes,” said Thomas.
Thomas said he also expects Sirleaf to mention the progress and future of Africa, as well as the contributions of international aid donors.
Gonzalez-Pose said she expects Sirleaf to give “a very encouraging speech about what leaders can accomplish,” recalling Sirleaf’s “empowering” 2008 commencement speech at the Kennedy School.
Gonzalez-Pose added that she does not think that Sirleaf’s commencement speech will have political ramifications in Liberia.
Sirleaf, who has nearly completed her first six-year term as president of Liberia, will be up for reelection in October.
However, Gonzalez-Pose said she does think that Sirleaf’s speech may garner attention in the United States.
“I think it might influence the American community in [Sirleaf’s] favor,” she said.

Blayn Jiggetts and Jason Aquino—two of the three men implicated in the May 2009 Kirkland House shooting—have made an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for cooperating with the district attorney’s office.
Originally charged with first-degree murder, Jiggetts and Aquino now face the lesser charge of manslaughter after agreeing to cooperate with Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. in the case against Jabrai Jordan Copney—who allegedly shot Justin Cosby—according to the Boston Globe.
 
Jiggetts and Aquino now face a maximum sentence of 20 years in jail after making the agreement with prosecutors.
Jiggetts took the stand Friday against Brittany J. Smith, a former Harvard student and Copney’s girlfriend at one point, at the Middlesex Superior Court, according to the Globe. During her arraignment last March, Smith pleaded not guilty to charges of accessory after the fact of murder and several other charges related to the shooting.
At the hearing, her defense attorney, John Osler, tried to get the court to throw out all criminal charges against her, according to the Globe.
Smith originally signed a non-prosecution agreement in exchange for agreeing to divulge everything she knew about the shooting. According to the Globe, prosecutors allege that Smith withheld information related to the case and therefore reneged on her agreement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Residents living near the future construction site for the relocation of the Charlesview Apartments, a low-income housing unit, raised concerns that the complex’s move might decrease their property values and that the construction project might lead to an increase in pests and noise at a public meeting Wednesday.
In a land swap deal with Harvard, The Charlesview Board of Directors intends to relocate residents of The Charlesview Apartments—a concrete cluster of low-income housing units located near Harvard Business School—from its current location near the planned Allston Science Complex to a site a few blocks west on Western Ave.
General contractor John Moriarty & Associates and other members of the construction team presented the 2-year construction plan to residents at Wednesday’s meeting. The proposal will be considered by the Boston Traffic Department before demolition begins in April.
Some residents who live in the vicinity of Charlesview’s new location expressed concern that the value of their homes will significantly decrease as a result of the relocation. These residents said they worry that the addition of low-income housing in their neighborhood will drive down property values, something that could have ramifications for residents on both sides of the income divide.
One neighborhood resident, Tim McHale, said that he was concerned that fears of declining property values might make it difficult for low-income residents to integrate themselves into the neighborhood.
“We want to embrace the arrival of the Charlesview residents,” McHale said, who also added that residents’ primary concern at this juncture is “the completion of the physical structures in a timely and safe matter.”
Construction plans include building an underground parking garage for the future residents to leave street parking available for current neighbors. Additionally, representatives of John Moriarty & Associates said construction trucks will occupy parking spaces within the site and will rent spaces in other areas in order to decrease interference with residential life.
“Construction needs to be a proactive approach rather than a reactive approach,” said Chris Brown, senior vice president of the company.
According to Felicia Jacques, director of development northeast region for The Community Builders, mixed-income housing will be built in an effort to redevelop Charlesview. Construction is slated to begin this July, and plans include construction of 240 units for rental housing and 100 homes, which developers hope will improve housing for residents and reinvigorate Western Ave.
In the past, Allston residents have raised concerns that construction projects in the city have negatively impacted the community by, for example, drawing pests such as rats and mice.
At Wednesday’s meeting, residents said dust and pests from the construction could raise health issues, but contractors said that they will put in place measures to mitigate such effects.
Brown said construction will “work from the outside inwards” in order to create walls that will buffer noise and dust. He added that rodent control plans are in place both at the construction site and at nearby sewers.
“Before we start any work on site, the entire perimeter will have little black rodent control boxes in place,” Brown said. “We will have a weekly monitoring system to check the boxes, rather than monthly ones.”
Construction plans also include slightly moving the McDonald's in the Brighton Mills shopping area in order to extend Teleford Street. The Community Builders said this will allow for more pedestrian traffic while creating space for the Charlesview relocation.
The Community Builders also announced that they will continue to have an open-door policy, opening an office in 355 Western Ave., where residents can ask questions and voice more concerns during what is expected to be a 28-month long construction project.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (7-8, 0-3 EIVA) traveled to the West Coast to face California State Northridge (5-15), Pepperdine University (7-11), and the University of Southern California (15-1).
The Crimson had known going in that it was to face some stiff competition, as USC is currently ranked No. 1 in the country and Pepperdine is No. 13. Unsurprisingly, the road trip was tough on the Crimson, which lost all three matches and has now lost seven of its last eight.
Inconsistency has plagued the Crimson so far this year and is something that it hopes to improve upon going into EIVA play in the season's final stretch.
“Consisitency is where we struggle,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “When we play well, we can really compete with teams at any level. We tend to give up points and streaks that really hurt us. We can’t do that in second half of league play.”
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 3, HARVARD 1
What was perhaps the Crimson’s most impressive performance of the week came Wednesday night, when it faced the best men’s volleyball squad in the country: the Trojans of Southern California.
Though USC primarily played its backups throughout the match, Harvard was able to put together a solid performance and avoid a sweep. Ultimately, the Crimson fell by scores of 25-19, 25-23, 22-25, 25-16.
“[The match against USC] was our best match,” Baise said. “Our ball control was much better, our defense blocked well, and I’m happy with how we served. It was a great way to end the week.”
PEPPERDINE 3, HARVARD 0
A day prior, Harvard faced a daunting opponent in the Waves. Pepperdine did not take the Crimson lightly, as it played its top players throughout the match. Ultimately, Harvard fell to the No. 13 Waves, 25-14, 25-13, 25-15.
Pepperdine held a significant height advantage in Tuesday’s match. The Waves boast a roster containing six players who are as tall or taller than Harvard’s tallest player-freshman outside hitter Michael Owen, who stands at 6'7". Members of the Crimson pointed to the height disparity as a key factor in the match.
“They were physically dominant,” said freshman middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper. “Their size was just too much for us to handle with blocking.”
Rehkemper had a strong performance against the Waves, leading the Crimson with 10 kills and a .533 attack percentage. The freshman attributed his success to the speed of his play.
“I tried to be fast on the ball and beat the bigger guys that way, by being quicker than them,” Rehkemper said.
CALIFORNIA STATE NORTHRIDGE 3, HARVARD 0
In its first game of the Golden State trip, Harvard fell to the Matadors, 3-0. CSU Northridge dominated the opening set of the match, leading Harvard from the opening point. Though happy with the rest of the match, members of the Crimson pointed to the travel to California as a reason for their stagnant first set.
“We came out a little flat,” Rehkemper said. “We were all pretty jet-lagged from the trip. Aside from that, i thought we played pretty well.”
The Crimson’s Matt Jones led all players with 14 kills and added a pair of service aces. Despite Jones’s performance, CSU Northridge registered as many kills as Harvard – each team finished the match with 37. The Crimson was defeated by scores of 25-16, 25-20, and 25-17.
Jones has been a major contributor for Harvard all season long and was especially key for Harvard matched up against taller, stronger West Coast teams.
Coach Baise also suggested that the junior outside hitter’s impact is even greater than his impressive stats may suggest.
“[Jones] plays with as much intensity, determination, and focus as anyone out there,” Baise said. “Not a point goes by that he doesn’t give 100 percent. His attitude carries over to the other players; they follow his lead.”
Regardless of the results, the junior from La Jolla, Calif., said that the late-season road trip was helpful for the Crimson.
“Despite how strong the team was on the other side, we played well.” Jones said. “Especially against USC, you may not call it a win, but it was one of our most productive matches. If we put the same fire and focus in the games back in our league, I think we’ll have success.”

For the coaching staff and eight players of Harvard women’s water polo, the annual trip to California returns them to their home state. But while the Golden State represents home for a majority of the team, it also holds some of the toughest competition the women will face this season.
With only two games left in its seven-game tour through California, the Crimson (10-7, 1-0 CWPA) stands 2-3 for the week. Two of Harvard’s losses came at the hands of ranked teams and the third stemmed from a one-goal defeat, facts that provided the Crimson with many lessons.
“All the teams have played really differently, so you really have to minimize mistakes,” freshman Jamie Williams said. “We’re taking every game one game at a time. We’ve been really building as a team this week.”
SAN JOSE STATE 8, HARVARD 5
Harvard faced its second ranked opponent of the week in No. 9 San Jose State (15-8) on Wednesday.
Although the homecoming was pleasant for Harvard coach and Spartan alumnus Ted Minnis, the 8-5 loss to his alma matter made it an overall bittersweet experience.
The Crimson was able to fight with San Jose State for the opening three quarters, only trailing 4-3 going into the fourth. But, four Spartan goals in the closing frame put victory out of Harvard’s reach.
“Although they may have won and pulled away, we showed really well as a team that we can play with any team,” sophomore attacker Aisha Price said. “We’re all very happy with how we played, even though we lost.”
UC DAVIS 13, HARVARD 5
A sluggish offense against No. 15 UC Davis (12-6) led to the Crimson’s widest defeat of the week so far.
Although Harvard was able to compete with San Jose State on Wednesday, the exhaustion of four games in two days weighed heavily on the Crimson, who consistently trailed by a significant margin to the Aggies on Monday.
“We learned a lot of lessons in that game, and it showed two days later when we played San Jose State,” Price said.
HARVARD 11, FRESNO PACIFIC 9
On Monday, Harvard preceded its loss to UC Davis with an 11-9 comeback victory over Fresno Pacific (5-11). The Crimson’s forceful offense was led by a stand-out performance from sophomore 2-meter guard Elise Molnar, who scored three goals and had four of Harvard’s 10 steals.
The Crimson trailed by four goals as late as midway through the third quarter, but a stronger team effort changed the dynamic of the game.
“I think we had to exercise ball control and show a little bit more patience on the clock,” Price said. “It was a really good team effort—people really stepped up to put balls in the net.”
The extra patience and additional defensive adjustments boosted Harvard’s performance and allowed the Crimson to run away on an 8-2 streak to defeat the Sunbirds by a narrow margin.
CSU MONTEREY BAY 12, HARVARD 11
A last-minute goal from Monterey Bay (11-4) stymied the attempt at a second comeback win for Harvard on Sunday evening.
The Crimson managed to knot up the score at 11 after having trailed by as much as four goals in the first half.
A 3-1 run in the third frame helped put Harvard within reach of a victory, but the Otters’ speed proved too much for the Crimson, who was unable to take a lead.
HARVARD 8, SANTA CLARA 7
Harvard debuted in California with a triumph over Santa Clara (8-12) and this time saw itself on the winning end of a one-goal game.
After knotting the score at two early in the opening series, the Broncos shifted their play into a higher gear, sprinting ahead on a three-goal run to close the first half.
“We just had to get our head on straight,” Williams said. “You can’t think in the past. It’s all about now… and so we did a better job in the second half. You just have to look forward and know you can play better.”
The Crimson quickly turned around its luck and responded with a three-goal run of its own in the third quarter.
After battling point-for-point throughout the fourth, junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski finished off Santa Clara with a final goal in the last 17 seconds of play.
“I think the Santa Clara game was a really good win for us,” Price said. "We were able to set up well as a team, and it helped us set up for the rest of our games for the rest of the week.”

Before Thursday’s match, the Harvard women’s golf team hadn’t played competitively since the middle of October.
To make matters worse, the Crimson had to shake off the rust while facing Berkeley, ranked the fourth best team in the nation by Golfweek.
As could be expected, the Bears soundly defeated Harvard, 289-315, at the par-72 Ruby Hill Golf Club in Pleasanton, Calif.
“We’re definitely a little bit rusty, and today was a good test to see where we stand and know what we need to work on,” captain Mia Kabasakalis said. “It was a good opener.”
As has become the norm, freshman Bonnie Hu led the way for the Crimson. With a one-under 71, the freshman phenom, named one of Golfweek’s 20 “Freshmen to Watch” at the beginning of the fall season, delivered her second-best performance of the year.
What’s more, Hu tied Cal player Joanne Lee for the low score of the day.
“Bonnie played phenomenally well,” Kabasakalis said. “She has shown no signs of getting over the winter break and getting back into the swing of things…She’s an incredibly talented player.”
The five-month break didn’t treat the other players on the team quite as kindly.
Junior Jane Lee came in second for Harvard with an 80, followed by Kabasakalis and junior Christine Cho, who shot an 81 and an 83, respectively.
All three of these scores were well above 74, the Bears’ worst score that counted.
“In the end, golf is just so dependent on the number of reps you are getting if you’re going to be scoring well,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Your form can look good, [and] you can basically be hitting good shots, but the difference between okay shots that don’t turn out very [well] and contribute to a bad score versus good shots that contribute to a good score…[is a] high numbers of reps.”
The team practiced indoors during the winter offseason and this week played a variety of courses in the Monterey area.  But to Rhoads, none of that offers true preparation for actual matches.
“Your body feels different when you haven’t been competing for a while,” Rhoads said. “You see it with Tiger Woods right now: he’s working through swing stuff so that each time he’s playing, he’s hitting it well on the range and he’s hitting it well in practice rounds. But when he gets to competitions, [the ball] is not always doing exactly what he wants it to."
“So, in a strange way, we were Tiger-esque [Thursday].” Rhoads added.
Other factors, in addition to Harvard’s long break, worked against the Crimson on Thursday. To start, Harvard had never played Ruby Hill before, a course familiar to the opponent.
And the greens also gave the Crimson trouble. After playing on punched greens the day before, Ruby Hills’ greens were fast and at times unforgiving.
In particular, Cho, who averaged +5 during the fall season, perhaps felt the effect of playing on the new course more than the rest of her teammates.
“I watched [Cho] hit a couple shots where she thought she’d hit good shots, and they turned out badly or in a hazard [because she didn’t know the course],” Rhoads said.
Usually a strong putter, Cho also failed to master the greens, uncharacteristically missing putts within six feet.
Of course, even if the Harvard players had shot strong scores, beating Berkeley would’ve been a challenge. As a team, the Bears shot just +9, not too far from even par.
Despite the easy victory for Cal, Rhoads stood by his decision to meet up with such a formidable foe so early in the season.
“It’s probably a little hard on confidence to [play them] this early in the season,” Rhoads said. “But I also look at it as a great motivator…at the risk of knocking down our confidence, it also shows us [that we need to] keep on working and keep on striving for the direction that [Cal] is in.”
Even with the loss, the team feels like it’s close to breaking through.
“We’ve gotten some good work done this weekend, and next weekend in Florida, we’ll do the same,” Kabasakalis said. “Everyone worked really hard over the winter, and it might not be quite showing itself yet, but I think it will.”

Crimson FM Chair Mark J. Chiusano offers the fan's perspective on last Saturday's loss to Princeton.
III.
When the game is over they get a ladder over to the far hoop so that Princeton can cut the net.  First they lower the hoop from behind to attach an Ivy League Banner to the top.  You’d think they’d cut the net there where it’s easy, but they raise it back up again and put the orange ladder underneath.  Someone says, from behind me, “I’m not staying to watch them cut the fucking thing.”  I find myself guilty to be thinking if my pose looks snapshot-worthy of the fan in defeat.
Coming out of the gym an event organizer shouts that an opening door is not in use, but no one pays attention to her and the crowd funnels out into the open.  The buses are parked immediately outside and everyone Harvard jumps on quick.  The gym from behind has scaffolding going up to the top.
I am staying the night in New Haven and I begin to follow my friend’s directions to his apartment. I walk through the medieval structures that could be churches even though they are labeled Law School.  I was only vaguely paying attention to my friend, before the game, when he described the way to his place, and I realize that I will have to call him to help direct.  First I sit on the stone outside the library, it is one of those early spring pre-evenings that remind you of the end of August.  Everyone else is on the buses heading back to Cambridge, and no one else is outside.  I wonder why I feel so devastatingly unhappy.  The grass is very short on the long lawn.  Someone comes out of the stone library and trips on the top step.  I take my phone out of my pocket to ask my friend to tell me the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s lacrosse let a game versus Boston College yesterday slip away, allowing five unanswered goals to be scored in the last six minutes.  The Crimson (1-4) met the No. 20 Eagles (8-1) on Newton Campus and fell, 15-10.
Those last minutes were crucial for Harvard. The visiting team couldn’t gain possession of the ball to score against BC.
“Our inability to win the draw near the end of the second half posed a big problem,” junior co-captain Melanie Baskind said.
“When it was 10-10, we gave the ball away, dropped passes, and lost possessions,” sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen added.
The Eagles finished with an edge over Harvard in draw controls (15-12), winning nine in the second half. The Crimson maintained a lower total of turnovers, 14-12, and picked up more ground balls, 11-9.
The first half had even scoring, despite what the final tally may show.
Sophomore Danielle Tetreault, who led the team with a hat trick, scored two of her three goals in the first half. VanderMeulen also scored two, and junior Jess Halpern and freshman Chelsey Newman also tallied one each for the half. Harvard went up 3-1 in the first seven minutes.
BC rallied to score five out of the next six goals. At the end of the half, the Eagles had the 7-6 advantage against Harvard.
“We had a good lead going and BC fought back, and then BC had a good lead going and we fought back,” VanderMeulen said.
The Crimson was anticipating a battle to win the game against the ranked team.
“We knew going in that BC was a good team and it was going to be a hard fight,” VanderMeulen said, “and we did fight well.”
The two cross-town rivals were looking to make a statement in the young campaign.
“BC is always an important game,” Baskind said. “There is definitely a regional rivalry there.”
Harvard though is still learning how to play together and fix its mistakes.
“We have a lot of different personalities on attack, and we are trying to figure out how to best utilize them in a single unit,” Baskind said. “We’re well on our way to figuring it out, but it’s clear that we’re not there just yet.”
The Crimson had a balanced attack with five players contributing to the scoreboard and tallying more shots on goal.
Defensively, the team struggled in the second half to adjust and defend against the ball.
“The thing that stuck out was our inability to adjust to the different situations we were seeing,” Baskind said.
“We were a little more patient in the first half than we were in the second,” VanderMeulen added. “We took care of the ball more.”
BC came out stronger in the second half. The Eagles quickly scored two straight goals, extending their lead to 9-6.
Tetreault scored her third goal, Halpern her second, and Baskind her first and second to bring Harvard back on the map, evening the score at 10 each with less than 10 minutes to play.  Baskind’s goals were 25 seconds apart.
After this, both the Crimson defense and offense fell apart.  BC controlled most of the draws and ground-ball pickups in the last seven minutes.
“We should have been getting off good shots,” VanderMeulen said.
“Offensively, I think we needed to play smarter,” Baskind added.
The home team finished with more shots on goal, in addition to scoring the last five goals.
Several of Harvard’s turnovers were in the second half. But the Crimson still caused several turnovers, as Baskind, Tetreault, junior Ellen Gleason, and rookie Lauren Tomkinson each caused BC to turn the ball over.
Harvard also had trouble with fouls. The Crimson players committed 38 fouls while the Eagles had only 12.  BC took advantage of Harvard’s penalties, scoring seven of its eight given free-position shots.  The Crimson scored three of its five free-position shots.
“BC capitalized on our mistakes,” VanderMeulen said.
Harvard is confident that it can adjust in its upcoming games and put some tallies in the win column.
“We play a schedule this tough for a reason,” Baskind said, “and I am confident in our ability to learn from these games.”

A month ago, we reported that Tyra Banks had enrolled in the Executive Education Owner/President Management Program at Harvard Business School. The supermodel dropped $31,000 for the first three-week session of the course, a program designed for CEOs and company presidents which consists of three sessions spread out over three years.
Banks' recent stint at Harvard has passed quietly. Twitter hints indicated her presence on campus, but few students reported Tyra sightings—much as we would have loved a Shaq-inspired statue display. Indeed, it's hard to believe that the superstar was roaming among us.
Through some Googling and some strategic late-night television watching, here's what we've been able to dig up so far about Banks' time along the Charles.
 Banks, who is set to graduate from the program in 2012, seems to have had a blast at HBS. She told Jimmy Fallon that "every time a term ends, I get withdrawal and I get attitude for, like, a month because I miss my friends, I miss my professors, I miss living in these dorms. It's like a bubble."
Yes, that's right, she was living in a dorm! On Fallon's show, Banks revealed that on-campus living was mandatory for program participants. Though she admitted that she at first "freaked, freaked, freaked out" about having to live in a dorm, she has "grown to love" her single room and shared living space. With her room decked out in Target decor, Banks "wouldn't have it any other way" and described the experience as "like summer camp."
In fact, her regimen sounds more like boot camp. Banks told USA Today that the program is "very, very intense." The diva said she woke up at 4:45 a.m. every morning to "work out and eat breakfast beforehand and get ready and be a female" in order to make it to a 7:30 a.m. study group meeting.
 You might wonder why Banks is putting herself through all this. The answer seems to be her newest project, TypeF.com, a personalized fashion and beauty website. In an interview with CBS News, Banks said, "In order for my company to grow and be the best ... I needed the best. So I went to the best."
In her talk with CBS, she elaborated on her need for a Harvard education. "I don't want to be that girl when I'm meeting with them, where I'm like, 'Uh-huh, great.' I now can say what's the net present value on that? What's the discounted cash flows of that, and that's because of Harvard."

If your pen is burning a hole in your pocket and love is burning a hole in your heart, now is your chance to write! The New York Times is now accepting entries for its second "Modern Love" college essay contest.
"Modern Love," a weekly column in the Times' Sunday Styles section, features stories on all kinds of love—from a tale of dating two different people with the same name, to an anecdote about the thrill of "sex on the run," to a moving essay about the death of a spouse. Some of the regular topics might not resonate with twenty-somethings, but questions of love (requited or otherwise) are certainly on college students' minds. Hence, the college essay contest.
 
Three years ago, when the college competition was last held, one winning essay (on the all-too-familiar question of commitment in relationships) and four runner-up essays were chosen by the Times. 
 
After the success of "The Social Network," we're sure an eloquent essay about love at Harvard would be a must-read. Wax poetic about a love that went beyond its beginning as a dance floor make-out in the beer-soaked Delphic basement. Pen a tearjerker about losing out on love at Felipe's after not having enough cash to pay for two late-night burritos. Describe that post on I Saw You Harvard that initially sparked a seemingly great relationship—but culminated in a restraining order. That's all modern love. 
 
Last time the competition was held, over 1,200 essays were submitted (almost 700 arrived on the final day—college students are procrastinators). However, as Harvard students are used to facing low odds, that number shouldn't intimidate anyone.
 
Essays must be between 1,500 and 1,700 words and should be submitted by March 31. For more information, click here.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION:
 The March 18 article "Calling All Lovestruck Writers" incorrectly implied that Felipe's Taqueria accepts Crimson Cash when, in fact, it does not.

Are you on campus for spring break and desperately searching for food? Dining halls may be closed, but there are still plenty of on-campus eateries that are open and accepting both BoardPlus and Crimson Cash.
Serving a variety of coffee, teas, breakfast pastries and sandwiches from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on weekdays, the Perkins Observatory Cart is especially convenient for Quad residents.
Up at LISE on Oxford Street, the Buckminster's Café is still serving students from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on weekdays.
Although it may be a bit of a walk, the Northwest Café opens up at 7:30 a.m. and serves burgers and paninis in addition to traditional sandwiches, breakfast pastries, and coffee.
All of the options above are closed on the weekends, so make sure to spend your BoardPlus today and plan to eat out Saturday and Sunday. Luckily, by Sunday night the majority of the dining halls will be open.
