Is the Ed Sheeran renaissance upon us? In less than a month, Sheerios can anticipate a 4-part Sheeran docuseries on Disney+, as well as a full album entitled “-” (“Subtract”) with accompanying merchandise and live performances. To kick off the new era, Sheeran dropped his upcoming album’s lead single, “Eyes Closed.”
Released on March 24, “Eyes Closed” is Sheeran’s fourteenth single to reach number one in the U.K. The song is a tribute to his late friend Jamal Edwards, who passed away last year.
“This song is about losing someone,” wrote Sheeran in a recent statement on his Instagram. “Feeling like every time you go out and you expect to just bump into them, and everything just reminds you of them and things you did together.”
Despite the resonant grief that inspired Sheeran’s “Eyes Closed,” the song sounds far from sad. From its upbeat tempo to its twangy guitar plucks, the single sounds more like a children’s movie soundtrack than a memento for a lost friend. Sheeran’s emotional struggle is explicitly captured in his lyricism — take the lines, “It's been a while, my dear / Dealin' with the cards life dealt / I'm still holdin' back these tears,” or the pensive question, “I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?” from the chorus. However, when set to a bright pop soundtrack, these sentiments lose their emotional punch.
In contrast to the instrumentation of the song, the music video does a successful job of capturing the mourning tone of “Eyes Closed.” Featuring a large furry animal that shadows Sheeran through his trip to a bar, the video more clearly explores the difficulty of moving through the world after loss.
“Often sadness is something that follows you around engulfing the rooms you’re in,” said Sheeran on his Instagram. “You can feel and see it, but no one else around you can. So I decided to create my own big blue monster for the video.”
The “big blue monster” is a physical manifestation of Sheeran’s lost best friend, and speaks more directly to the mournful tone of the song than its musical composition alone does. Accompanied by clips of Sheeran drowning underwater and drinking heavily at a bar, the music video takes a somber approach to the song’s themes.
Unfortunately, the lyrics of “Eyes Closed” are littered with clichés. Whether this is due to Sheeran’s choice to address such broad emotions as loss and mourning, or whether it has simply become a pattern for the musician, it’s easy to feel that many of the lines in “Eyes Closed” have been heard before. Even the titular line of “dancin’ with my eyes closed'' is fairly redundant, and this is only bolstered by his sentiments that “life just goes on” and “time is movin’ so slow.”
Although many of the lyrics in “Eyes Closed” are fairly literal, it’s clear that the song still carries real feelings. Sheeran himself has been very vocal about the emotion he’s put into his new single.
“This song means the absolute world to me,” said the artist in another Instagram statement. “It's the start of an album I’d been overthinking for years and feel like I’ve finally made the perfect representation of where I am right now.”
Whether “Eyes Closed” is a “perfect representation” of grief or not, it just might mark the beginning of Sheeran’s musical renaissance. While far from the chart-topping domination of the dance tracks on Sheeran’s “Divide,” the single still marks a return to his roots for the English singer-songwriter.
“I’m so excited for the next stage,” Sheeran continued, “and today marks the beginning of that. I hope this song connects with you the way it feels to me when I sing it, I really, really love it. Eyes closed out now, Subtract out May 5th.”

Whether for better or for worse, it’s common for long-running television shows to change over time. With “Riverdale,” it’s safe to say that what started out as a classic CW teen drama based on the comic “Archie” and best known for its small town charm has transformed into something else. What exactly that something else is has been eluding the average viewer for quite a few seasons now.
The Season 7 premiere opens on an unexplained, discordant image: Within the first few seconds, characters are dancing and spinning in over-dramatized ’50s attire as part of an old time intro set to Bill Haley & His Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock.” Not only has the timeline of the show rolled back roughly 70 years from where it left off in the Season Six finale, but it soon becomes clear that none of the characters even remember their past selves. This goes for all involved in the time shift except for everyone’s favorite cynical, beanie-clad teen loner, Jughead Jones (Cole Sprouse) — who makes it very clear to the viewer that he remembers everything, and he’s haunted by it.
Most premiere reviews need to provide some background information to get viewers up to speed, but in a case where the setting, past storylines, and memories of virtually all its characters are completely erased, it’s not clear what context is truly necessary for the last installment of “Riverdale.” By this point in the show, most characters have dated or married several others within the main cast, depending on which timeline you’re considering. The core group has rallied together, torn itself apart, fought crime, and — in the truly unhinged Season 6 finale — used witchery to prevent world destruction from a cleverly-named “Bailey’s Comet.” Therefore, it might be best to consider the Season 7 premiere as a completely separate entity.
After the cliche ’50s intro and Jughead’s expositional monologue establishing the cast as all “somehow juniors again,” the first plot point to be introduced is, alarmingly, the murder of Emmett Till. This is not a passing point or historical context, but instead a major conflict throughout the rest of the premiere episode, and presumably the rest of the season. The show’s choice to incorporate such a deeply painful and serious moment in African American history into a plotline that has devolved into nothing short of delirium comes off as extremely insensitive.
Every scene with Betty (Lili Reinhart) throughout the episode is devoted to her plight to have coverage on the Till trial published in the school newspaper by one of the school’s only Black students, Toni (Vanessa Morgan). The audience has to follow a somewhat painful subplot as Betty reckons with the extent of the racial disparities taking place in the ’50s timeline, detached from all memory of the progressive future in which she comes from.
Not only does Toni have to negotiate with multiple white men describing her article as “well-written” before dismissing it, but she and her two other Black peers are called upon on the spot in class to educate their classmates on what they witnessed at the trial — a problematic request by a teacher that is somehow painted as progressive.
Upon witnessing “Riverdale”’s decidedly inept handling of the Emmett Till trial, it comes as a relief to see that the rest of the show is mostly unmoored from its setting. The only other historical figure who receives attention is James Dean, as a name to embellish the Hollywood-raised Veronica’s (Camila Mendes) glamorous background. Dean’s supposed bisexuality is also used as a jumping point for the (previously lesbian in past seasons) Cheryl to display some marked homophobia: After Veronica hints at Dean’s presumed bisexuality, Cheryl is outraged that she would “besmirch his memory like that.” The choice to change Cheryl's sexuality for the last season feels unnecessary for the plot and jarring in relation to her character in past seasons.
As far as continuity goes, the premiere ends on an even more concerning note than it begins. Jughead, after unearthing a time capsule from the future and considering how to convince the others to travel back to their past storyline, is confronted with the future rendition of his girlfriend, Tabitha (Erinn Westbrook). Tabitha provides some exposition on what’s going on timeframe wise — the group’s attempt during the Season 6 finale to prevent the so-called Bailey’s comet from destroying civilization failed, and so Tabitha used the last of her “life-force” powers as a witch to transport them to a safe life in the ’50s. It appears that she cannot, as Jughead eloquently puts it, “use [her] chronokinesis and get [them] the hell out of 1955.” Instead, Tabitha insists that everyone “make a go of it” in the ’50s to ensure that, quoting Martin Luther King Jr., “the moral arc of this universe bends towards justice” in the meantime while she figures out her magical reversal solution. And no, the tie between “Riverdale”’s elaborately-constructed multiverse and the sentiments of MLK is not made overly apparent in this scenario.
The premiere ends with Tabitha removing Jughead’s memory of the future through a prolonged and dramatic kiss, and Jughead rushing to write down the words “Bend. Towards. Justice” before blacking out. Considering that the sole person who had any motivation to return the cast to their future environment has lost all memory of his goal, it’s hard to say what future episodes may hold, or how a stunted version of an MLK quote will help them get there.
As a whole, “Riverdale”’s Season 7 premiere is concerning on an artistic level, but more importantly, the careless way it handled its subject matter. The show’s choice to take itself lightly and make bizarre compositional choices on its own is respectable enough, but not when this approach causes insensitivity towards the history of race relations in America. In its very first episode, the final season of “Riverdale” has made several sizable missteps, and at this point is arguably just a glaringly sub-par piece of entertainment.

Maisie Peters’s newest single from her upcoming album, “The Good Witch,” is an unhinged breakup pop ballad that makes for a perfect springtime anthem. With a snappy beat and lyrics detailing the process of moving on from the end of a relationship, “Lost The Breakup” explores themes of rebirth, self-love, and excitement for adventures to come.
Its debut on The Tonight Show: Starring Jimmy Fallon on Friday, March 31, was Peters’s first live performance of the new single, though certainly not her last. In an Instagram caption promoting the song’s release, Peters said, “It feels like a song I’ll want to sing live for the rest of my life,” and with a resoundingly hopeful yet chaotic narrative set to a dynamic beat fit for dancing, there’s no surprise as to why.
In a sharp contrast from her previous single, “Body Better,” released on Jan. 27,Peters is no longer worried about her ex’s new partner and is instead moving on while rebuilding her sense of self. While acknowledging that “I’m feeling and I’m dealing / With the heart you broke,” Peters isn’t wallowing in sorrow. She condemns her ex and reaffirms her self-worth.
The addition of the drums in the pre-chorus creates an exciting tension before Peters proclaims, “I’m the best thing that almost happened to you,” and the beat drops for the start of the remarkably catchy chorus.
Peters’s acknowledgement of the present day chaos that surrounds her doesn’t diminish the potential of her future romantic possibilities. Her assertion in the chorus that “by then, I’ll be far away / and, oh shit, you lost the breakup” is a powerful, if not inspirational, prediction for love to come. With a lively instrumental backing supported by the drums, fans are sure to dance while singing, “I’m the greatest love that you wasted.”
The song’s bridge paints the picture of meeting an ex at a bar and finally being unbothered. Rejecting a bid for connection and prioritizing herself, Peters’s avenging encounter exemplifies the scornful but self-assured tone of the single. Illustrating the ultimate step to letting go and moving forward, Peters’s short but poignant dialogue conveys a sense of freedom and excitement that she “won the breakup.”
Though “Lost The Breakup” is not particularly complex in its instrumental production, its simplicity allows Peters’s vocals and lyrics to shine while telling an exciting tale that fans are sure to belt along to.
“Lost The Breakup” is an entertaining and empowering ballad indicative of the memorable lyrics and bright pop sound to come from Peters’s album, “The Good Witch,” which is set to release on June 16.

While other teenagers have diaries or an archive of Instagram stories to commemorate their childhood, Nicole P. Austen ’25 has a published book. “Black Magic,” which Austen started writing when she was 13, was published last August. As the first book of her children’s series “Shadow of the Pack,” “Black Magic” follows the magical adventures of a wolf pack.
Growing up in Los Angeles, Austen was an avid reader who would “always have a giant book on [her] desk.” She described reading the “Warriors” and “Guardians of Ga’Hoole” series as a child, and how she did not want to stop at merely reading these books — she wanted to write them.
“I just really enjoyed being able to do what the authors I loved did with words,” she said. “I just loved words and playing around with them and making sentences that just felt right or that surprised me. There was something really satisfying about it.”
Books weren’t the only thing that inspired her. The setting of “Black Magic” was inspired by the nature she grew up surrounded with.
“My family likes to go on vacation in Portland, Oregon and hike up there,” she said. “I sort of absorbed the woods and then put them in the book.”
Austen’s family encouraged her early writing efforts, recognizing it as a worthwhile hobby they wanted to support. Her family, in fact, were the first people to buy her books.
“My dad would take [my chapters] and laminate them […] and then I would sell them to each member of my family for a quarter,” she said. It created an environment that helped Austen build the habit of writing during her school breaks.
Writing was never a static experience for Austen. Because the process of writing “Black Magic” extended through most of her teenage years, she viewed it as a sort of homing beacon.
“I never really felt completely separate from it or like it was a different time in my life,” she said, “mainly because I kept revisiting it so often to edit it again and again.” Writing served as a constant that accompanied her as she grew up — a way for her to keep tabs on the progress of her life.
Austen was drawn primarily to fantasy, which she attributes in part to how it allowed her to process her own opinions on real world issues.
“In fantasy, you can sort of address things in a way that is unique and imaginative and a little less head on,” she said. In an often exhausting world of ambiguities and social issues, fantasy was an escape, an outlet that freed Austen to (literally) write her own story.
Though the worlds that Austen’s characters reside in are fantastical, she insists on them still making sense, building her world’s social principles and beliefs before delving into the inner psyche of each character. “You have to think about how different things have proliferated and exactly why [characters] think in certain ways,” she said.
As an English major pursuing a secondary in Classics, she obsesses over world-building and creating fictional social structures in her writing, confessing that “mythology is very much in my head.”
Since “Black Magic” is a children’s book, Austen was mindful of the lessons that she wanted kids to take away from it. She focused particularly on encouraging readers to accept themselves for who they were.
“[Gaining acceptance] is a tough thing for kids, I think, and something that is on their minds a lot,” she said.
However, she was careful to balance these messages with entertainment. “I think what kids want to read is what they should read,” she said. “And I think that whatever would broaden their imagination and make them happy […] is what they should be reading.” As such, “Black Magic” is not merely a book about the hijinks of a wolf pack in a forest — it revolves around themes of family and friendship, and of accepting yourself even when others may not.
Rather than work on multiple ideas at once, Austen prefers to go all-in on a single idea and focus on that project for months at a time — a strategy that doesn’t always come easily to her.
“I know a lot of writers have this thing where they think of a ton of ideas, and they can’t decide which one to go with. And I honestly wish that were me, because I will just sit and wait for the idea to just come to me,” she said with a smile. “I never have any idea what I’m going to write after my current project because I’m so all in on whatever I’m writing right now.”
Though it leaves her “aimless for two to three months” following the completion of a project, it does explain why writing is so dear to Austen, because she is absorbed by whatever story she’s working on, each finished project is a time capsule of the person she was when she wrote the book, a familiar friend that is almost like a “homecoming.”
Of course, this means that each of Austen’s projects are also extremely personal. When describing her finished book, she said, “It’s just something that exists in the world, but that has come 100% just out of my brain, which is,” she paused — “really weird.”
The feeling of putting writing out into the world for others to read is heady and exciting, but it’s vulnerable, too: It exposes the writer to critiques of something that they’ve poured their soul into. Austen described the process of sending her work out for edits as “going up to someone and being, like, ‘Punch me in the face.’” Despite this, she relishes sharing her work, pointing out that the process makes her “tougher.”
In the future, Austen is excited to branch out and explore different genres of writing. “I want to write a creative thesis, and so I think that might be an interesting place to do something totally new,” she said. “A sci-fi novella might be really cool, but I also might do realistic fiction or something along those lines.” In the meantime, though, she’s working on her next novel, an epic fantasy called “The Soul-Forged Crown.”
No matter what the future holds for Austen, one thing is clear: Writing will always be a significant part of it.

Pro Dillinger is an artist whose raw talent, dedication, and undeniable charisma have positioned him as a promising force in the East Coast underground. Hailing from Rockland County, New York the rapper has already made a name for himself in the underground scene as the co-founder of the Umbrella Collective, a New York-based hip-hop crew. Pro Dillinger’s music is lyric-driven and gritty, recalling the no-holds-barred style of classic New York hip-hop.
Born in the Bronx, Pro Dillinger grew up with a mix of influences from both his city upbringing and the time he spent with his father in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was exposed to street culture and hip-hop at a young age, thanks to the house parties and battle rap scene that were a constant presence in his life.
“It was vibrant, there was a lot of dudes out here rapping,” Pro Dillinger said. “At one point, it felt like everybody out here rapped. They used to do battles at the barbershop in town at Mr. B's barber shop. There used to be all type of dudes walking around selling mixtapes out of their bags and whatnot. We used to go to house parties and there was always somebody there to battle.”
In addition to his upbringing, Pro Dillinger is also heavily influenced by the punk scene in New York City. As a high schooler in the late ’90s, the rapper regularly attended punk shows hosted by bands like The Casualties. According to Pro Dillinger, his love for the punk genre is tied to its communal atmosphere and close association with hip-hop.
“The punks and the hip-hop kids used to have to share the same venues because all of the venues were disco clubs back in the day,” Pro Dillinger said. “I would hear a lot of stories about punk kids chillin’ with hip-hop kids. That's what we did.”
The rapper shared that his marketing strategy is partly influenced by the punk bands from his youth. “Everything I do is guerrilla,” the rapper said. “Even in my videos, I just pop out the camera, shoot the shit and leave. It's the same thing with the shows. My music is very fast and aggressive, upbeat. My first couple of projects in the underground was EPs. I learned that from punk rock because it'll leave people wanting more.”
Through hard work, determination, and a little bit of luck, Pro Dillinger eventually found his way into the underground hip-hop scene. According to the rapper, it was his June 2019 release “EveryOnes Foul” that put him on the map in the East Coast underground.
“That kind of set it off for me,” Pro Dillinger said. “Because at first I was just supporting people, I had no idea that the scene still existed. I remember the old scene with Psycho+Logical-Records, MF Doom, like I was from that underground era. I had no idea that it had survived those years of gangsta rap, party rap, down south rap.”
His dedication to his craft has paid off, with Pro Dillinger now being a key player in the Umbrella Collective, a group that's making waves in the underground scene. Founded by Pro Dillinger and Snotty in 2018, the collective aims to pool resources, foster talent, and provide a supportive environment for its members, which include the likes of Mickey Diamond and Josiah The Gift. The group has evolved over the years, with its current roster being the strongest it's ever been, according to Pro Dillinger.
“Timing is everything,” the rapper said. “Right now, I feel like we’re the most dangerous as far as rappers. All the artists we have with us are top notch. And then we still have production. We have visual artists. We're like a self contained unit.”
What sets the Umbrella Collective apart from the rest is their commitment to authenticity and organic growth, according to Pro Dillinger. “Everything's under one umbrella,” the rapper said.
“That was the original inception of it. That's exactly what we did. Over the years, we modified it some people left, some people got kicked out, but where we are right now is the best it's ever been.”
Recently, Pro Dillinger has been hard at work on multiple projects, including his upcoming album “Dirt Don't Hurt” and a collaboration with Snotty called “Steiner Brothers.” He's tight-lipped about specific projects in the works but promises that by this time next year, he'll be “your favorite rapper's favorite rapper.”

Since 2018, YG Entertainment has been rolling out a series of solo releases for the four members of the K-pop girl group and worldwide sensation Blackpink. The group’s lead vocalist, Jisoo, is the last member to release a solo project, having spent the last year starring in the Disney+ drama “Snowdrop.” Her long-awaited single album “Me” was released on March 31, along with a music video for lead single “Flower.” Although the song isn’t as theatrical as the other members’ projects — there will likely be no viral TikTok fame in its future — “Flower” is a classy, laid-back debut that sets a promising precedent for Jisoo’s solo career.
“Flower” begins with a snappy, plucked-string instrumental track that continues throughout the song’s three minutes, supporting Jisoo’s signature low vocals as she sings of a love gone sour: “There was nothing left but the scent of a flower.” The verses have a sophisticated, mature groove that creates an almost indie sound, more reminiscent of DALsooobin’s “Sign” than the music coming out of mainstream K-pop this year.
However, the chorus of “Flower” takes a more conventional approach. Jisoo’s vocals cut out before the chorus in favor of an instrumental anti-drop — a trend that’s become tiresomely popular in recent years of K-pop. However, Jisoo manages to deliver a compelling hook despite relying on the stale trend. The chorus sounds a bit empty without a vocal melody, but composer 24’s excellent production will keep listeners interested throughout.
The song also doesn’t build, instead maintaining a meandering cadence throughout the majority of the track. “Flower” really only picks up in the outro, where Jisoo’s vocals are finally allowed to soar as she sings, “Now goodbye, goodbye / Never looking back.” It’s a wonderful moment, and the song could have benefitted from that change in sound occurring earlier, which would have brought more variation to the somewhat stagnant aspects of the track.
The single album’s B-side, “All Eyes on Me,” is a strong track that complements “Flower” well. As an uptempo, EDM-backed song with lyrics promoting self-confidence (“Please don’t look away / All that I need / All eyes on me”), the song shows a different side of Jisoo while highlighting her distinctive voice and style.
Although “Flower” may have been underwhelming if sung by someone else, it’s a well-fitting song for Jisoo, who has the understated charisma needed to carry the track. Jisoo has typically been the most introverted member of Blackpink, and the kind of bombastic, self-assertive solo debut that fellow members Jennie and Lisa delivered wouldn’t have fit her performance style. Instead, “Flower” shows that in the hands of the right artist, not every song needs power vocals, a rap verse, or even English lyrics — “Flower” is sung almost entirely in Korean.
Jisoo is headed in a promising direction with her solo debut, and fans will be excited to see what she does next.

Detroit rapper Mickey Diamond has been making a name for himself with his signature deep-voiced delivery and gritty lyricism. Last December, he dropped his album, "Gucci Ghost," in collaboration with producer Big Ghost LTD. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Diamond delved into his inspirations, creative process, and connections within the rap community, giving fans a glimpse into the life of a rapper on the verge of greatness.
Detroit is Mickey Diamond’s hometown and creative center, but the rapper was born in South Carolina. Moving to Detroit in elementary school led to Diamond's eventual pursuit of a career in rap, where his Detroit roots play a crucial role in shaping his sound.
“I moved to Detroit in ’97. It was a culture shock. I lived in a small town down south. I bounced between South Carolina and Georgia because my dad was in the military. By the time we finally moved up here, I was 11-years-old, an impressionable age where you start learning everything. Detroit is fast, And at least compared to what I was coming from.”
Mickey Diamond's style stands out within the Detroit underground, blending elements of boom-bap and classic New York City hip-hop to create a sound that is more in line with contemporary East Coast artists like those signed under Griselda Records. He cites Outkast and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony among his early influences, alongside Detroit legends like J Dilla. Diamond’s father had a prominent influence on the rapper’s taste in hip-hop, introducing him to artists like Ice Cube and DMX.
“I remember when [my dad] bought ‘Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood’ by DMX,” the rapper said. “My dad had a paper route and we played those albums back to back to back every night for like six months, while we did the route. Because we ran the route so much, I knew by the time that we made it to a certain song on the album that we were almost done.”
Last December, Diamond dropped his latest work, “Gucci Ghost,” and its sequel “Gucci Ghost 2,” both fully produced by renowned producer Big Ghost LTD. The anonymous beatmaker has worked with the likes of Conway the Machine, ANKHLEJOHN, and most recently Griselda rapper Rome Streetz.
“Funny story is I had sent him a message in the DM like, ‘I love what you're doing. I would love to be able to work with you someday,’” the rapper said. “That message literally went unseen for a year.”
Diamond shared that his collaboration with Big Ghost came about after the producer saw the Detroit rapper perform online in a December 2021 freestyle showcase at Top Shelf Premium, a clothing store in Hoboken, N.J. Diamond performed at the store alongside his collaborators from the Umbrella Collective, a New York-based hip-hop crew founded by Pro Dillinger and Snotty in 2018.
“When we did Top Shelf Premium, I guess [Big Ghost] saw the freestyle, he hit me and we started talking,” Mickey Diamond said. “What really brought the album about though was a picture he sent to me. It was a picture of every single cassette that I have ever put out. He told me, ‘I’m a fan.’”
Inspiration for “Gucci Ghost” came from Canadian snowboarder Trevor Andrew’s fashion alter ego, Guccighost, and the tumultuous history of the Gucci family.
“[Trevor Andrew] came out with a brand called Gucci Ghost, where he would spray paint the Gucci logo on refrigerators and all kinds of shit,” the rapper said. “He wasn’t contracted by Gucci, it was all independent. It inspired me because he got Gucci’s attention and they let him design a shoe.”
“I tied that in with the story behind Gucci and the Gucci family,” Diamond added. “There was a lot of chaos and turmoil with them running that luxury brand.”
“Gucci Ghost” and its sequel touch on themes of family, legacy and fate. The rapper’s attention to detail in his storytelling are evident on standout tracks like “GG Buckets.” Diamond shared that working with Big Ghost is just the beginning of his trajectory.
“It's one of the better deals that I've ever done,” Diamond said. “I got a bucket list of milestones for my career. This was a step in the right direction for me to see that I am on the right path, that I'm doing the right thing and that the right eyes are on me. Things can only get better from here.”

Chances are, if someone pulls Dior Addict Lip Glow out of their purse, discusses the need to acquire white eyeliner, or has scrolled through it-girl TikTok in the past month, they’ve probably heard of Alix Earle. The newest lifestyle and beauty influencer to take the platform by storm, Earle is a senior at the University of Miami who has recently sprung into the spotlight for her entertaining GRWMs and juicy life updates. Not only does she boast 4.9 million followers on TikTok and another 2.4 million on Instagram, but she is another example of a lifestyle creator whose popularity came about because of her unique approach to college vlogging — only to become consumed by the lure of trending audios and brand sponsorships.
Earle posts much of the typical content one would expect from a college student who went viral for her makeup routine last December. Her videos range from chatty makeup sessions and fit checks to trending dances. However, sprinkled through these normally run-of-the-mill TikToks are her candid life updates, allowing fans to slowly build a parasocial rapport with her. Before long, viewers are checking in again — not to see if her makeup routine has changed, but to see how that football game or date went.
As a TikTok user popular for her trend commentary, user katiexsocials observed that Earle creates her own intimate community by making us “feel like we’re in the in-crowd; we feel like we’re her friend.”
Fans feel inclined to binge the rest of her videos if they find themselves out of touch with what’s going on. Thus, by reminding her audience of what she’s been up to lately and letting them know about what’s to come, Alix Earle cultivates a devoted fanbase on an app that throws new creators at our faces daily.
However, since her rise to virality, Earle has been unapologetically chasing easy trends and, well, the bag. Nowadays, her videos are trendy dances complete with a sponsored outfit tagged in the caption, snapshots of her life where she tells her audience about even more exclusive events that she attends thanks to her newfound fame, or straight-up sponsored posts (with collaborations ranging from protein powder to the recent Forever 21 x Juicy tracksuit revival). If one might stumble upon her page now, at the height of her popularity, they might not even guess her relatively humble beginnings. After all, isn’t she just another young college student drowning in views?
Despite coming from a relatively affluent background, Earle managed to maintain a down-to-earth demeanor, both before and after she became a viral sensation. However, it’s impossible to overlook the greater degree of separation between her and her followers now — Earle’s lifestyle once seemed attainable, but now it is much too far out of reach. Perhaps the wider access to VIP events her fanbase granted her makes the glitz and glam of her current videos harder to relate to.
Earle’s content may have taken a turn for the generic, but her rise to fame provides an important case study in internet popularity. While creators do what they can to differentiate themselves while striving for internet success, the viral posts, free PR, and exclusive influencer events that come with mainstream TikTok fame. Even so, her fans from day one will always remember Earle’s original GRWM excitement whenever they apply their Charlotte Tilbury magic cream.

Michael Chang activates readers’ imaginations with “Synthetic Jungle,” a collection of poetry that defies convention. Ambitious in its genre-bending forms, their poems span topics from queer sexuality to contemporary politics, with a voice that jumps between sardonic and playful tones. These dynamic shifts are entertaining and witty. Unfortunately, the collection often exhibits an exaggerated and parodic style, veering into a performative hyperbole that can feel inauthentic.
While “Synthetic Jungle” is sometimes overwrought, the collection must be praised for its experimental quality. The inventive uses of typography allude to modernist free form poets such as E.E. Cummings to create moments that push the boundaries of poetry. Chang liberally incorporates this unique formatting: Dotted lines separate each line of “Caducity,” while poems like “Polar Bears in Little Italy” and “Muscles” are formatted as footnotes. The poem “Equal or Lesser Value” takes the form of an album tracklist, with each stanza formatted as the title of a song. These bold choices give the poems and the overall collection a refreshing, novel quality.
These typographic choices are complemented by equally daring language. In a mocking commentary of internet speech in the current era of incessant online communication, Chang’s poems make use of short forms like “u”, “coz” and “w/o” in a way that makes the poems read less seriously. Even the authority of the traditional lyric “I” is downplayed using the uncapitalized, colloquial “i” familiar to avid text messengers. As referenced in the collection’s oxymoronic title “Synthetic Jungle,” Chang’s collection reflects on the non-traditional, current-day communication.
Ultimately, these casual language choices make the collection’s discussions of serious matters such as queer self-love and cultural celebration feel interactive and engaging.
“guys always want u to take their load but have they ever stopped to consider (!!!)/ what a heavy burden it is to carry,” Chang writes.
These lines simultaneously touch on queer hypersexualization and its negative impacts on self-worth while preserving humor. Chang uses the collection to continue to defy traditional poetry by using chinese phrases such as “想念你的每个角度'' that are included without translation. Chang places the onus on non-chinese-speaking readers to derive their own translations — a radical act that decenters the anglophile gaze.
However, the collection falters in its overreaching commitment to this experimental quality. While the formatting of the poems presents an interesting departure from traditional forms, some of these choices feel driven by novelty rather than literary consideration.
In “Homeschool Prom King,” Chang underlines almost every word. This typography comes across as a gimmick rather than a substantial, meaningful choice.
The language itself also takes on this gimmicky quality, with multiple instances of diction that rely on grating shock value. Lines like “make me really feel it like JFK” or “i hate linen it’s so wobbly & indecisive & lacking in substance like zayn’s foreskin” are so jarringly gratuitous that they take attention away from the rest of the poem. It may be difficult for readers to read on after encountering such a distasteful line.
Even when not blatantly shocking, the poems often rely on cliche and figurative language that lack emotional impact. The poem “My Forever Person” features only three lines. Chang writes, “VOICE KINDA STRANGLED / I GUESS U HAD TO BE THERE / FOR SELFISH REASONS”.
The reader may feel confused by what feels to be more similar to an angsty diary entry than a piece of poetry. Lines such as “i take care of u pasta salad / the stumbling block i look forward to” from Chang’s poem entitled “Teacher’s Pet” exhibit a similar lack of context that results in confusion.
Ultimately the language choices in “Synthetic Jungle” fail to push this poetry beyond a repeating series of parodies. Moments of beauty like “i eat busily between ur legs / all-encompassing, so vantablack” and “strange what you remember / the lillies / a clap of thunder” are overshadowed by the collection’s relentless dedication to shock-factor. The collection feels overbearingly avant-garde, as the poems seem to be vessels for experimentation rather than an attempt to express emotion to the reader.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While condensed matter physics is the largest subfield of physics, there still exist few popular science books on the topic. Condensed matter physicist Dr. Felix Flicker set out to change that. Flicker is currently a lecturer in physics at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom. In conversation with Harvard physicist Dr. Norman Y. Yao ’09, Flicker visited the Harvard Science Center on March 10 to speak about “The Magick of Physics: Uncovering the Fantastical Phenomena in Everyday Life,” his book on the subject.
Flicker bounded on stage with a lively smile, following a charming anecdotal introduction by Yao, who worked closely with him at UC Berkeley when Flicker was a postdoc. “A man of eclectic tastes,” according to Yao, Flicker exuded natural charisma and eccentric charm. Outside of physics and writing, Yao talked of how Flicker “has practiced kung fu for many years and taught kung fu at Berkeley.” In addition, “he was the British national champion of a Chinese style of wrestling known as shuai jiao … he taught sailing, he plays Mahjong, he plays bridge,” said Yao. “He’s really one of the most interesting people that I know.”
While Flicker’s academic research focuses on the application of geometry and topology to quantum materials, his book offers a broader overview of his scientific interests to appeal to an audience that may not have heard of condensed matter physics before. In the beginning of the talk, Flicker raises the question of why there are no mainstream science books about his field. Flicker believes this is the case because the physics subfields that dominate popular science — astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics — are assumed to be more directly tied to wonder.
“People will agree that there’s something inherently magical about the stars,” said Flicker. Condensed matter physics, on the other hand, concerns the study of ordinary matter, which does not naturally lend itself towards “[the] unimaginably large and the unfathomably small.” Flicker explains that it is hard to unearth a sense of magic and inspiration from such a practical science.
Though what exactly does it mean for something to be magical? Flicker defines magic simply as “the ability of the world to inspire.” While the familiar nature of condensed matter physics does not immediately seem conducive to incomprehensible, mysterious, and wonderful, Flicker’s book aims to prove that this is not the case. Flicker argues that his field of study has the equal potential to inspire wonder: “It can be more subtle, but is just as present,” he says.
“The writing really came together when I had the idea to start the book with fiction rather than non-fiction,” Flicker said later in an email. “Rather than try to describe the magic condensed matter physicists see in their subject, using fiction allowed me to just show it, by presenting an obviously magical situation before switching to non-fiction and pointing out that this is magic we perform every day.”
Flicker thus reveals the magical nature of condensed matter physics by starting with the foundation of a fictional story: A wizard illuminates a dark cave with a magical crystal that Flicker later reveals to be a simple light-emitting diode (LED). The book then unfolds into a series of fantastical yet ultimately scientific scenarios. As described in the synopsis, the book is “full of owls and mountains and infinite libraries, and staffs and wands, and martial arts and mythical islands ruled by sage knot-makers.”
This creative approach helps reawaken a sense of curiosity to share scientific topics in an accessible way for both physicists and non-physicists alike.
“I thought [the talk] was great, because I learned what condensed-matter physics was, which I wondered about for about 35 years,” said Melissa Franklin, Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics at Harvard and organizer of the book talk.
Jeff Mayersohn, co-owner of the Harvard Book Store and fellow event organizer, also enjoyed the talk. “I loved it also because I learned what condensed-matter physics was,” said Meyerson, “but also I learned about this potentially very exciting development in the field of condensed matter physics which I thought they explained beautifully.”
The development in question was announced at the American Physical Society’s March meeting, the largest gathering of condensed matter physicists in the world. This new finding was the establishment of superconductivity under ambient conditions — essentially, a superconductor that exists at room temperature. Flicker and Yao discussed these latest developments in the field with both the ease of knowledgeable experts and the accessible manner of science communicators.
“For humanity, it’s monumental,” Flicker explained. “You can now pass electricity from one place to another without losing any at all.”
Indeed, the talk featured a discussion of many fascinating topics in condensed matter physics, and many of Yao’s questions were geared towards unpacking the science and non-fiction aspects of the book. Together, the two scientists discussed different kinds of physicists, the concept of a quasiparticle, and the importance of noise in condensed matter physics — all topics that Flicker illustrates through magic and wizardry in his book. Yao’s thoughtful and eloquent comments allowed Flicker to delve deeper into the physics of the talk.
The talk felt like an informal but highly articulate conversation between two friends and intellectual peers. Both physicists referred to each other fondly as “Norm” and “Felix,” and audience members could sense the joy of a reunion between friendly colleagues after many years.
The reception afterwards featured a book-signing and opportunities to speak with Flicker and Yao about the talk.  “It is just super special to have people who can communicate science come and tell you about how they communicate science and why they were interested in writing a novel or a book,” said Yao.
Yao explained that he enjoyed getting to moderate such a talk after having attended these types of events as an undergraduate: “Now being able to be on the other side with a post-doc of mine was super special … It's a full circle feeling.”
“My main hope in writing the book was to recruit new people to condensed matter physics … from as diverse a range of backgrounds as possible,” wrote Flicker in an email to The Crimson. “I hoped the fictional parts might help reach people who might not naturally read a popular science book, but who might find the links to magic and fantasy approachable.”

Ina Cariño has a heavy hunger: for family, for the self that arises from it, and for the living memories it creates. Cariño, a Filipinx American poet, is a 2022 Whiting Award winner who released their intimate debut poetry collection Feast in March 2023 under Alice James Books. Throughout the 35 poems in this collection, Cariño’s community sings. Lolo and lola, tito and tita, elders, parents, cousins, and country all have a place in their words.
Cariño unflinchingly examines the dual realities of personhood: being as an autonomous self, and being as an extension of the generations that gave you life. They were born in the Philippines and moved to the United States at 10 years old. Their poems interweave cultural notes from their country, such as words in Tagalog, Cariño’s native language, as well as ingredients in traditional Filipino foods and religious experiences.
In a poem titled “Rice,” Cariño writes, “I listen in half-light breathe still tilt my ear / as memories of lola float up with the milkscent / over her shallow basket she’d clean the rice.” Cariño’s themes have a beautiful continuity throughout the collection. Rice is mentioned in several poems, including the final work in this collection, “It Feels Good To Cook Rice.” In this poem, Cariño describes how many members of their family have passed away before stating, “it feels good to eat rice even by myself.” Time does not operate linearly in this collection, and those who have passed on do not lose their connection to the present. This is a powerful portrayal of how cultural and familial teachings live on.
In a discussion with Angela Narciso Torres for the New England Review, Cariño explained that they did not italicize Tagalog words in the opening poem to this collection, “Bitter Melon,” because they did not want to signify Tagalog as having “foreignness” or being “other” — which to Cariño, it is not. Rather, the use of words in Tagalog stimulates a conversation between reader and poet, as readers unfamiliar with Tagalog are required to look up these words if they want to truly understand the poem. When the reader takes this extra care, the true nature of Cariño’s poems are revealed: They are teeming with a life and energy that a reader simply cannot grasp if they do not make an effort to understand the language.
In the poem “Bitter Melon,” Cariño refers to the bitter melon, a vegetable called “ampalaya” in the Tagalog language, with its Tagalog name. She also incorporates other Tagalog words and phrases, writing that “you’ll wince. you’ll think of the taste / of your own green body—mapait / ang lasa. your sneer. masakit, dugo’t / laman. it hurts, this smack of bitter.” In this poem, Cariño creates a connection to any diasporic reader who has grown up with the experience of eating the bitter vegetable. Many of the poems in this collection are grounded in similar lived experiences, and thus readers who grew up with the same backgrounds can find a familiar home in Cariño’s words.
Cariño’s collection adeptly grapples with the tensions of existing in the United States as an immigrant and a queer person alongside the beauty of Filipino culture and lineage. Their debut feels boldly autobiographical, and “Feast” does not hesitate to use the physical body as a canvas to explore these themes.
For instance, the poem “Soiled” follows a child with head lice. Cariño viscerally describes the collaborative process as a parent removes lice from the child’s hair: “edge pressed to keratin edge— / pop!—until the sacs burst & spray. / tiny teardrops, harmless. / sometimes, there is blood. / soon our own lunar cuticles are dotted / with my own wet crimson.” Among the poems in this collection, “Soiled” is no outlier in its use of graphic imagery. Cariño’s work feels intentionally candid in detailing the physicality of human bodies, as if Cariño is attempting to mitigate the shame often felt from biological existence.
The title of a poem near the end of the collection, “Piyesta,” is translated and defined in an explanatory note: “Feast: n. A large meal, typically held as a celebration.” This impressive debut is certainly a celebration of culture, of family, of the Philippines, and of the human body. There is no doubt that Ina Cariño is an important poet of our age, one who will not hesitate to share the stories they find in beautifully gripping detail.

It’s lighter out longer, the air is warmer, and the flowers are blooming again. Spring has finally arrived! It’s the perfect weather for putting on a light jacket and taking a long walk through the park, so head outdoors with a friend or two to enjoy the wonderful weather and scenery. Here are five parks to visit in Cambridge this spring.
5. Cambridge Commons 
Just a short walk from the Yard, Cambridge Commons is across the street from the Johnston Gate. The park features paved bike and pedestrian pathways, making it a great spot to go on a run, or simply walk around with headphones on. A podcast, audiobook, or favorite song would complete a walk through the park’s looping pathways, and one’s worries might begin to fade away. A large grassy area in the center of the park practically begs for visitors to throw down a blanket, and take in this little gem of a park.
4. Joan Lorentz Park
Located right in front of Cambridge Public Library, Joan Lorentz Park is the perfect place for a morning or afternoon stroll — and maybe even a quick trip to the library. The park features extensive greenery, tall trees, and a vast space to play frisbee with friends! This park is also a hot spot for dogs, so opportunities to watch cute puppies run around abound. Along with puppies, the park even features tennis courts! Whether it’s a study day at the library, relaxing in the sun’s warmth, playing tennis, or hanging with dogs, Joan Lorentz Park has got it all.
3. Riverbend Park
For those afternoons when the sky turns pink as the sun sets, grab a blanket, some snacks, a good book, and head down to the Riverbend Park along the Charles River! This is one of the best spots near Harvard Square to watch the sunset and sunrise over the glistening water — the best view is from the bridge that leads directly to the Harvard Business School. The breathtaking view is not to be missed. The park is also ideal for running and biking enthusiasts, since the street is closed off to traffic every Saturday and Sunday.
2. North Point Park
Further down the Charles, North Point Park makes the walk to get there totally worth it. The park serves as a haven next to the bustling highway, with its beautiful perennials and meadows. A small bridge over the river provides an ideal view of the vibrant trees and various flowers. This is the perfect place to disconnect from the world for a moment, getting lost in the garden’s calming atmosphere and soothing river sounds.
1. Mount Auburn Cemetery
If there’s one thing everyone should do this spring, it’s to plan a day trip to the Mount Auburn Cemetery. The park acts as an urban oasis, featuring the serene Asa Gray Garden. Visitors can walk throughout the many pathways to enjoy the mesmerizing greenery, sit for a couple of hours with a book, paint, or just listen to the birds chirping. Mount Auburn Cemetery is an inspiring place — full of life and surrounded by flowering trees, shrubs, and a calming air that flows throughout the landscape.

TikTok has taken the world by storm, inspiring countless viral dance crazes and making stars out of everyday users. In fact, the app hosts over 150 million Americans — almost half of the United States' entire population. But for all its fun and games, TikTok has recently found itself in the crosshairs of Congress, which has threatened to ban the app over concerns about data privacy and national security. While one would think that this case is serious business — the congressional hearing — which was done before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, seemed anything but. The hearing was a painful watch as Congress members refused to let the CEO Shou Zi Chew speak and asked inane questions such as whether TikTok connects to the Wi-Fi.
Concerns over TikTok’s national security capacity stem from fears that TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, is allegedly sharing user data with the Chinese government or that the app may be used for propaganda or disinformation campaigns. However, it is unclear whether Congress has evidence for these claims; New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez posted a TikTok where she claimed that Congress had not received a formal briefing, which is standard protocol when facing a national security threat.
Data collection is a real problem with all social media apps, not just TikTok. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was found to violate privacy laws in 2022 and was fined a whopping $275 million in the E.U.
So why is the government only threatening to ban TikTok? Why not other social media platforms that may have the same issues? Perhaps it is because several members of Congress own stocks in social media companies like Meta. In 2022, Meta also paid for intense lobbying among GOP party members to spread messages about the danger of TikTok.
Many users came to the platform to discuss the hearing, including user @callmebelly.
“I am so embarrassed to call myself an American today, so embarrassed. The disrespect in that Congress room, the arrogance, the lack of knowledge, the racism, all of it was absolutely disgusting,” Elliot said.
One example of this lack of knowledge was Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter seemingly not understanding how filters work, questioning why TikTok would need to see a person’s eyes for the sunglass filter to work.
“Why do you need to see where the eyes are if you’re not seeing if they’re dilated?” Carter said in a recording of the congressional hearing.
On a more amusing note, Chew has gained popularity since the hearing, with some users making thirst traps of the CEO presenting his testimony.
TikTok user @rheaisna commented, “he’s our tiktok daddy fr,” under the TikTok linked above.
Despite these legal troubles, the popularity of the app has not been affected whatsoever — if anything, the cultural powerhouse that is the app has only become more mainstream. As confusing as the current situation appears to be, it’s clear that a future without TikTok would be just as challenging to comprehend.

The Met Gala is the most iconic fashion event of the year, where all gather round to judge celebrities’ much-anticipated looks. Attendees never fail to stir up controversy with style wins, fails, and moments that will live on for all time. With originality, adherence to theme, beauty, and cultural impact as our criteria, here are some of the best all-time Met Gala looks:
10. Princess Diana, Christian Dior (1996)
When it comes to Princess Diana, every one of her looks deserve a place in fashion history. Diana’s navy blue Dior dress at the 1996 Met Gala exemplified the ’90s silk, lace, and slip silhouette that are currently making a comeback. Her pearl choker studded with a planet-sized sapphire — a wedding gift from Beatrix — was a stand-out piece from the look, pairing allure with royalty.
9. Zendaya, Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between (2017)
At the 2017 Gala, Zendaya swept onto the red carpet in a stunning ball gown of gold and orange. The top’s wrapping flowed right into the paint strokes of the rococo-inspired parrot pattern. The design was undeniably classic, artistic, and unforgettable. We could sing (or squawk) about it all day long!
8. Lupita Nyong’o, Camp: Notes on Fashion (2019)
Lupita Nyong’o’s outfit of pink six-pointed stars, rainbow ruffle shoulders, and golden hair picks transformed her into a campy angel, paying homage to the drag origins of camp, Black style, and the actress’s own personality. Ultimately, her outfit was impossible to look away from.
7. Solange Knowles, China: Through the Looking Glass (2015)
Although it might’ve fit 2016’s theme of “Manus x Machina” better, Knowles’s printed dress was one of the most visually mesmerizing looks ever. The fabric appeared as if it was almost molded from a UFO hull or static TV screen, sucked into a space-time continuum, developed like film, and pleated like a mermaid’s tail.
6. Naomi Campbell, Haute Couture (1995)
Naomi Campbell’s gem-encrusted dress transformed her into a walking diamond under the camera flash, and its glamorous elegance proves timeless. She looked like a modern Cinderella showered with her Fairy Godmother’s magic sparkles. The dress was custom-made by haute couture icon Gianni Versace himself.
5. Ariana Grande, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination (2018)
Ariana Grande brought Michelangelo to the Met for one of the best themes of all time. Her gown’s “The Last Judgment” pattern, draped romantically over softened layers of tulle, had art history nerds everywhere singing “Hallelujah.” Each detail was exquisite: the tan tulle evoked the Sistine Chapel’s arches while Grande wore matching painted nails.
4. Lady Gaga, Camp: Notes on Fashion (2019)
The 2019 Met Gala theme “Camp: Notes on Fashion” let the reins loose on creativity, yet many guests disappointed in decidedly mundane suits and dresses. Good thing Lady Gaga — one of the co-chairs that year — was born camp. With a whopping four outfit changes, she entered the pink carpet in a voluminous hot pink gown and draped herself over the stairs in sparkly black lingerie, teaching everyone a lesson on the true essence of camp: performance.
3. Cher, Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design (1974)
Cher began a storied tradition of “naked” dresses with the naked dress. Glittering, feathery streams cascaded down a sheer, form-fitting dress that Cher graced both the red carpet and a TIME magazine cover with. Her legacy remained ever present with the showstopping “naked” Met Gala looks of Beyoncé in 2015 and Kendall Jenner in 2021.
2. Zendaya, Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination (2018)
Draped in silver chainmail-esque beading and glittering plates of armor, Zendaya perfected costume couture. She stood out from a sea of bejeweled Madonnas by emulating Joan of Arc, ready to defend France from the English, for the Catholicism-inspired theme.
1. Rihanna, China: Through the Looking Glass (2015)
Rihanna is a consistent Met Gala superstar, but her imperial yellow Guo Pei gown was especially iconic. Rihanna brought visibility to a talented Chinese designer as the dress stirred up a lot of buzz, prompting comparisons to eggs, pizza, and Spongebob. Rihanna’s 2018 Pope look and 2017 Comme des Garçons dress are other memorable appearances, with only the limitations of this article preventing them from joining the Guo Pei dress on this list.

“What they gonna say now?!” yells LSU forward and “Bayou Barbie” Angel Reese as she points to her newly adorned Final Four hat. Reese and the rest of her Division I Women’s Basketball team have continued to make history, leading LSU to its first championship in history, after defeating Iowa 102-85 on April 2nd.
Reese — a former Maryland Terrapin — has led both her team and college basketball to new heights, leading the sport with 17 name, image, and likeness deals. Their regular season win against Mississippi State set an attendance record for Pete Maravich Assembly Center, bringing over 15,700 fans to watch Reese work. She also earned Most Outstanding Player for the tournament. While Reese is a star in statlines and headlines, she nonetheless continued to face backlash and hate.
Towering over guards at 6’3”, Reese takes ownership of the paint, averaging 1.6 blocks per game. In basketball, a block is a pure athletic act of domination that stops an opponent from scoring, making it one of the most exciting moments of a game. When Reese blocks, she often has some trash talk for her opponents, letting them know she’s one step ahead of them. But while blocks in men’s basketball can be praised to the point of being deemed historic — such as Lebron James’s block against Andre Iguadola in game 7 of the 2016 NBA finals — when Reese does it, she often faces floods of hate comments.
While faceless commenters might feel safe to bash Reese’s play style, she took to Twitter to let them know she’s unafraid to be herself on and off the court.
“‘I’m too hood.’ ‘I’m too ghetto.’ I don’t fit the narrative and I’M OK WITH THAT. I’m from Baltimore where you hoop outside & talk trash. If it was a boy y’all wouldn’t be saying nun at all. Let’s normalize women showing passion for the game instead of it being ‘embarrassing,’” she wrote.
Angel Reese is calling out misogynoir, a term that Northeastern University’s Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies professor Moya Bailey coined as “the ways anti-Black and misogynistic representation shape broader ideas about Black women, particularly in visual culture and digital space.” This policing of Reese’s play style is not just sexist, but also wrongly characterizes it as a violent act that intersects with her Blackness and contributes to the common stereotype that Black women are too aggressive.
To think further about how misogynoir functions in sports, let’s look at the criticisms of Reese’s white coach, Kim Mulkey, about her passion on the court. While she’s similarly labeled as overly passionate about her team, a label seldom painted on male coaches, it would be difficult to find comments calling Mulkey “hood” or “ghetto.” Conversations about sexism in women’s sports are continually being brought to the forefront of discourse around athletics, but it is critical to acknowledge the multiple forms of bigotry at play as they go unarticulated in these conversations.
In LSU’s win against the University of Miami in the Elite Eight, Reese set the SEC single season record for double-doubles; she later broke the NCAA record for double-doubles in the tournament final. Her pride and confidence is more than earned, and the racist undertones of the comment sections on her past prove that no matter the level of greatness, Black women — especially Black women in sports — must meet impossible expectations in order to gain respectability.
Another star who faces sexism in sport is Caitlin Clark, a dynamic sharpshooter known for her long range. She led her team, The University of Iowa, to their first championship appearance and was named the Naismith National Player of the Year.
Clark is an undeniable gift to basketball, becoming the first player ever to earn a 40 point triple-double in NCAA tournament history, regardless of gender. Her skill has done wonders for women’s basketball viewership — over 2.5 million fans watched Iowa’s win against Louisville in the elite eight, reaching rating highs the NBA hasn’t seen for the entire regular season.
Scattered below Caitlin Clark highlight videos are comments misgendering her, calling her “bro,” implying that a female athlete must have male biology to be as gifted as she is.
Women’s sports are often mislabeled as unpopular, less athletic, and less competitive — nevertheless, this year’s stars have reminded audiences that they are a force to be reckoned with. Most importantly, they have proven in their play and their presence off the court that sexism in sports can no longer be tolerated. The tournament continues to raise the question of why women’s sports are undervalued culturally despite their evident success, and if the success of this year’s stars has finally begun to turn the tide of misogyny.
The NCAA Women’s Tournament has seen a 42% increase in viewership from last year’s tournament. This year’s championship game also made history as the most-watched college women’s basketball game ever, with a peak of 12.6 million viewers and an average of 9.9 million viewers. Audiences are making it clear that they want to watch women’s sports, but the dialogues surrounding these athletes reveal the lack of social progress even amongst growth.
Sports are meant to bring communities together, teach children important life skills in cooperation and discipline, and entertain. The suggestion that history-making athletes like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese are anything less than extraordinary is more than false. It is a harm to the young girls on the court striving for excellence.
It is time to stop forcing female athletes to prove themselves and instead celebrate their greatness rather than simply accepting it. From coaches to trainers to athletes, the women in athletics are due for a resounding round of applause across the nation.

“My Neighbor Totoro” is filled with light — both metaphorical and literal.
This luminosity is especially apparent when watching the film on the big screen. Each year, theaters across North America participate in Ghibli Fest, during which they screen revolutionary Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki’s 10 animated films. This year’s Ghibli Fest celebrated the 35th anniversary of the release of “My Neighbor Totoro” alongside the other films in the classic Ghibli canon. On March 28, the film’s catchy, chipper theme song filled the AMC Boston Common theater as the audience tiptoed to their seats.
Even from the opening sequence, viewers are invited into the whimsical, optimistic world of the film; a tiny girl with a wide-brimmed hat marches rhythmically across the screen flanked by tiny white Totoros, mouths yawning as they stretch like marshmallows. The stylized simplicity of the opening animation is pleasantly disarming, yet the film’s moving storyline also delves into complex issues of grief and trauma in a cathartic way. “My Neighbor Totoro” remains unparalleled in its immersive storytelling, exquisite visuals, and uplifting message — the film leaves viewers feeling renewed and ready to believe in the world’s potential for joy and light again.
“My Neighbor Totoro” maintains this playful tone as viewers meet the main characters. Laughter dominates the soundscape of the film's first few minutes; two sisters, toddler Mei and older Satsuki, giggle as they crouch at the back of their father’s truck on the way to their new home. In these moments, Miyazaki’s quiet storytelling shines through. Though viewers are not explicitly told about each character, they watch the smiling, carefree sisters share caramels with their father and greet a passing biker. Their joy is infectious, making tangible the excitement of moving into a new home. Even a rotting porch post becomes a source of delight, as Mei and Satsuki shriek with glee at the idea that this imperfect, beautiful home is theirs. Within the first minute, Miyazaki’s expert characterization makes the viewers invested in these characters, further enhancing the film’s personal touch.
Studio Ghibli films are particularly adored for their visual appeal, and “My Neighbor Totoro” is exemplary of the transformative magic of director Hayao Miyazaki’s hand-drawn animation. Light-laden landscape shots are one of Miyazaki’s strengths, and these come to dominate “My Neighbor Totoro.” The patchy, vivid colors that have come to characterize Miyazaki’s style truly come to the foreground. Viewers are treated to still shots and pan outs of glittering rice paddies, emerald forests soft and fuzzy with sun, and a sunset stained orange like a soft-boiled egg yolk. And while the scenes depicted are largely mundane — truly just a rice paddy, a tree-dotted hill, a sunset — it’s Miyazaki’s faithful and intricate ode to the power and beauty of nature that transforms these everyday settings into the calming, peaceful landscapes they have become.
At times, Miyazaki skillfully manipulates this visual appeal to contrast with the emotional charge of the moment. For example, later in the film, Miyazaki takes a few seconds to dwell on the beauty of a summer evening, humming with cicadas and heat — yet the viewers know that Mei has gone missing and their ailing mother Yasuko may be in mortal danger. In this way, Miyazaki harnesses his visual storytelling power by juxtaposing this static natural beauty with Satsuki’s frenzied movements as she desperately searches for her lost sister.
Perhaps most important about Miyazaki’s visual prowess is his character design for the titular character, Totoro. Totoro is technically a monster, a fickle forest spirit living in a camphor tree, but his fuzzy, huggable nature, round body, and endearing button nose make the monstrous adorable. Indeed, this partially explains why Totoro merchandise is so prevalent, amidst a growing, billion-dollar industry for anime apparel.
Yet Totoro himself is more than just a fuzzy friend to the two young sisters. Though the premise of a massive forest monster coming to humanity’s aid is highly fantastical, this mixing of magic and reality is part of “My Neighbor Totoro”’s appeal. After moving in, the sisters plant seeds in their garden, waiting faithfully for them to grow. One night, Totoro and his two smaller friends creep into the garden to help the plants grow; thanks to their efforts, a copse of trees blossoms into the sky. This is one of the most uplifting sequences of the film; though the towering trees are revealed to be measly shoots in the morning, it is emblematic of the film’s overall message about the power of imagination and childhood and the necessity of hope in difficult times. “My Neighbor Totoro” empowers the audience to heal their inner child. Just as the sisters turn to Totoro’s mystical aid, viewers are given permission to dream of whimsical solutions to everyday problems. Sustained by the knowledge that all will be well, the film’s characters choose not to succumb to the bleakness of their situation; they are induced to choose the light.
The film’s relentless, unfailing optimism may be a response to traumatic events in Miyazaki’s own life. Ostensibly a carefree story of a family moving into a new home, the plot of “My Neighbor Totoro” carries undercurrents of tension that eventually explode in heartbreaking ways. When Yasuko’s condition worsens, the naive Mei desperately attempts to deliver an ear of corn to the hospital in hopes of curing her. Ultimately, it is Totoro and his Catbus friend who help Mei and Satsuki check on their mother, and the film closes with a happy reunion. By contrast, Miyazaki’s mother Yoshiko had spinal tuberculosis and ultimately passed away in 1983, before the release of “My Neighbor Totoro.” In this way, the film’s optimistic tone may be Miyazaki’s way of reaffirming his belief in the necessity of hope: Though not everyone truly has a happy ending, we can all imagine and hope for one.
Ultimately, “My Neighbor Totoro” exemplifies the healing realization that despite any doubts, joy can be found anywhere. On their first night in their new home, a thunderstorm batters the house, and the girls huddle with their father in the bathtub, spooked by every sound. Suddenly, their father bursts into boisterous laughter, claiming that laughter “keeps the bogeymen away.” The family laughs their fears away, their lamps glowing into the stormy night. Just as Satsuki and Mei gain the courage to face life’s challenges with optimism, joy, and a bit of supernatural support from Totoro, viewers leave the film with renewed belief in humanity — and a little bit of magic in their hearts.

Screened last week on March 22, “The Nightsiren” glued audiences to their seats with shock at the Boston Underground Film Festival. “The Nightsiren” details the return of a young woman, Charlotte (Natalia Germani), to the local village where she grew up to uncover the truth of what happened to her family after she fled as a young girl. Through a strong sense of visual atmosphere, this film takes a modern stance on its themes of community and womanhood in a way that almost feels like a storybook.
Czechian film director Tereza Nvotova opens this film with an unsettling plain black screen accompanied by intense banging and screaming. Immediately after, this film breaks the normalities of structure and opens with a traumatic climax that haunts the main character of this story throughout the rest of the film. In this scene, Charlotte flees both her home and her mother who is moments away from beating her to a nearby cliff overlooking the forest surrounding their village. However, unbeknownst to her she is followed by her younger sister who, upon noticing, she accidentally pushes off the cliff to her impending death.
Following this harshly intense open, beautiful shots of nature — such as flower sown fields full of frolicking sheep — fill the screen as powerful contrasting images. This juxtaposition indicates not only a change in time, as the film is now set in the present day, but a change in tone with events less grim than the film opened with. However, this hope is immediately squashed, as viewers are introduced to a now-adult-version of Charlotte who has returned to her village only to find nothing working in her favor. The experience of returning to what was once her home for the promise of an inheritance that seems to be nowhere in sight while nobody around is willing to see her as more than a mere outsider, leaves Charlotte to quickly become very isolated. Within this isolation, dark candle-lit visuals contrast the hopeful greenery of before, showing that there is still a very prominent negative energy that permeates the atmosphere of this village.
After Charlotte’s individual struggles have been established, viewers are introduced to other characters through the second chapter; the film is divided in seven chapters total. Here, the thematic messaging of the movie begins to become more clear as viewers quickly learn to despise any and all men that comprise the village because they can be characterized as greedy, reckless, and foolish. This theme of womanhood and the bond it creates is only strengthened as Charlotte’s relationship with the only person in the village who has shown her kindness thus far — Mira (Eva Mores) — grows. Eventually, due to a series of strange occurrences, the village becomes swept into a panic and they point their fingers first at what is foreign to them: the recent arrival, Charlotte. In a community that ultimately does nothing but create excuses for the horrible actions of greedy men, Charlotte continues to find love and support from her struggles only from Mira.
Ultimately, this film takes a strong stance — aided by experimental and beautiful nature heavy visuals — in support of the bond that womanhood creates for individuals in the face of hardship. It finds visual strength from the fact that the imagery that it shows is continuously very distinct, creating images (whether of beauty or of fear and darkness) that will stick in viewers minds well after the movie. It turns gender norms on their head as classic representations of evil, child stealing witches that are typically represented as women are instead framed as brave saviors. And it proves that even when all other representations of community fail, the shared struggle of those with shared identity can help to provide a sense of belonging.

Grab your dice and get ready, because “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” takes you on a wild ride through a magical world full of charismatic characters and epic heists. Directed by John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, the film does an excellent job turning the massively popular and beloved game into a film. And while “Dungeons & Dragons” may have some faulty special effects, the film’s charismatic cast, entertaining plot, and impressive fight scenes make it a fun ride for both fans of the game and newcomers alike.
The plot of “Dungeons & Dragons” centers around Edgin (Chris Pine) and his decision to join an honorable secret society despite the damage it does to his family. Edgin tries to repair his family through thievery but ends up in jail, separated from his daughter for two years. This drama sets the stage for him and his partner-in-crime Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) to pull off another heist to save his daughter and recover an artifact stolen by his ex-comrade Forge (Hugh Grant). The two are accompanied by Simon (Justice Smith) and Doric (Sophia Lillis) as they traverse the vast world of the Forgotten Realms in hopes of retrieving a helmet that will protect them from the magic of an evil wizard, allowing them to recover the stolen artifact and save Edgin’s daughter.
One of the most enjoyable parts of the movie was the acting of the impressive cast, consisting of Pine, Rodriguez, Regé-Jean Page, and Justice Smith, all of whom were naturally and wildly charismatic and hilarious. Page’s character, Xenk, was a particularly enjoyable watch, as he played a paladin — an ultra-religious warrior — with high-strung morals and an inability to understand sarcasm, which made for excellent comedic relief. Smith also made his character very lovable as the audience got to watch the unsure and awkward sorcerer gain immense confidence over the course of the film.
In addition to the strong performances, the screenplay was entertaining enough to keep viewers fully engrossed in the film. The abundance of fast speed plot twists and fight scenes kept the viewers guessing. In particular, the fight scene where Xenk single-handedly takes on a gang in the Underdark was very entertaining. The beautifully choreographed scene was enthralling. However, Edgin’s backstory fell a little flat. While his backstory initiated the events of the film, he didn’t exactly feel very necessary to the plot beyond that point. If he was removed, Holga could have served a similar purpose, and viewers wouldn’t miss him from the story. However, Pine’s acting makes up for this shortcoming of the script. Pine mostly managed to turn the character around and make him likable and charming in spite of his character’s lackluster lines.
Being a fantasy film filled with unique creatures and magic, the movie relies heavily on special effects, which were both a hit and a miss throughout the film. The visuals were particularly impressive when the characters venture into the Underdark to retrieve the Helmet of Disjunction. The Underdark is a whole other environment from the world above ground, filled with darkness and unique creatures. However, there were some parts where the visuals fell short. There were a variety of spells cast throughout the movie that relied on visual effects, and the magic was very obviously computer-generated and almost seemed cartoonish in some scenes.
“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” will definitely be an entertaining watch for all audiences. While the film is not without its flaws in writing and visuals, the pure charisma exuding from the cast, combined with the humorous plot and entertaining fight scenes, ensure that the movie is a definite success in taking the beloved franchise onto the screen.

Ryan Stevens Harris creates a dystopian fairy-tale universe in his film “Moon Garden” that was shown at the 2023 Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF). The film originally premiered in June 2022 and was put in the running for awards this past weekend. After five days of film viewing, the festival goers voted it the Audience’s Choice Best Feature Film. The film features the child-like horror of the industrialized machines in Harris’ underworld and the characters that govern it. Throughout the entire showing, the mix of horrifying special effects and animation had the audience’s heart rate running high.
The film “Moon Garden” follows a young family in the midst of a tumultuous time in the parents’ marriage. Emma, their only daughter, is only five years old but well-aware of the tension between her mother and father. When she goes into a coma after an accident in her home, the movie turns into a retrospective odyssey for Emma to find and unite her parents. Through her comatose, she fights the demons of her real life that have been reincarnated into monsters of her alternate universe.
Harris sets the somber mood with blue dusk-like lighting that is casted over both the family and Emma as she journeys through the many worlds of her imagination. The moon motif that comes from the title of the film is beautifully maintained through the harbingers in the spherical light fixtures of the family home, Emma’s homemade drawings, and even the mother’s blonde bob — which floats on top of her head like the moon.
“Moon Garden” combines many filming techniques to take its audience on the same eventful fever dream that its main character experiences. The set design is half enchanted forest, half decrepit factory, forcing the viewers to constantly be worried about Emma. Certainly the oozing blood and slithering faceless characters comfortably situate this film into the horror genre.
Although the audience is set up to worry for Emma while she ventures through the frightening world Harris created, it is difficult to develop a true empathetic connection to either her character or her parents. The plot-line establishes that there are verbally combative issues between the couple, but their origins are never fully explained. The lack of background on these family problems can cause the audience to constantly question the necessity behind these scenes.
Crucial dialogue is also missing from the movie. The fights between the parents lack believability, because no cause for the fight is ever explicitly mentioned. Additionally, the interactions between the parents and Emma are overly simplified for a character that is distinguished as smarter than other kids her age.
BUFF audience members delighted in the thrill of visual experience that Harris gave in “Moon Garden.” Despite the weak plot-line and clichéd dialogue, the film keeps the viewer engaged through its twisting and turning in addition to the visuals.

Released on March 11, “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster” is an explosively powerful feature length directorial debut from Bomani J. Story that turns the Mary Shelly classic novel “Frankenstein” on its head. Complicating the original tale by forcing the characters to exist in a world that automatically doesn’t accept them, this film redefines what a monster is for audiences.
Immediately, viewers of “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster” are introduced to the film’s main theme as it opens to a still shot of a dead body. “Death is a disease” is whispered for viewers to ponder until the body is dragged away. Vicaria (Laya DeLeon Hayes), the protagonist, then narrates about how death has slowly destroyed her family, killing her mother first, and then her brother. Now she lives in fear as her father, the only real family that she has left, has become addicted to drugs as an attempt to ease the suffering from losing the family members which he held so dear.
Vicaria, however, has other ideas for how to respond to this plague that has destroyed her family. She believes that death, like any other disease, can be cured, we just have yet to figure out how to cure it. She then assumes the role of Victor Frankenstein from the original classic, and works to reanimate the dead family and friends that she has lost, starting with her brother. Eventually, she succeeds, initially becoming full of elation at her achievement and the fact that what she loved has returned to her. Nonetheless, as she watches the husk of her dead brother murder those both deserving and undeserving, Vicaria must face the fact that perhaps she should not cheat death.
In “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster,” there is a notable amount of consideration put into worldbuilding, whether through the physical sets or the cultural background of the setting. The neighborhood where Vicaria and her family and friends live is developed very early on in the film as a lively place full of a diverse range of characters. From innocent children chasing each other down the streets with water guns to drug dealers sending gang members on “assignments,” the complexity of the mise-en-scene in this film is clear from the opening of the film. Lines like “death comes quick around here” help to not only cement the prominence of the theme of death in the lives of the characters, but reveal how it is systemically ingrained in the setting of the movie. It redefines death as a result of the environment, rather than a result of individual action.
The delivery used for its social messaging is almost too on the nose. By the end of the film, it has clearly been conveyed that the conditioning of society frames Black men as monsters without giving them their due. Society assumes their nature to be monstrous rather than humane, although this is never true. While this messaging is beautiful and important to convey, narrative tropes of struggle are a bit belabored. This film’s relationship with the police as characters is important to note, as there are multiple scenes where — were it not for the superhuman abilities of Vicaria’s monster — a moment of police brutality would have occurred. This example is just one where, although this film heavily critiques the experiences of Black trauma that are ingrained into American systems, it does so by presenting additional trauma to audiences. In an attempt to prove that it is opposed to the systems that oppress Black Americans, it neglects the fact that the thematic messaging of this film already does this perfectly.
Ultimately, “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster” takes an important stance on the role that grief can play upon the hearts of those unwilling to accept death because of the unfair circumstances that it almost always occurs in. It deals with a theme vital for audiences to walk home with and ponder: sometimes the odds of the world are stacked against you before you even enter the game. It validates the powerful feelings and the actions that are taken while experiencing those emotions, providing viewers with a beautiful narrative of a family working to find solace and rebirth after a great deal of worldly trauma.

“Everything Everywhere All At Once,” released in 2022 and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, absolutely dominated the Oscars this year, taking home seven awards including Best Picture. Although this win was undeniably deserved, it was surprising because, put simply, the film doesn’t feel like an Oscar winner. It’s weird, heartfelt, and thrilling — a mix that lands somewhere between intimate and beautiful. The plot of the film revolves primarily around Chinese immigrant Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh) who is struggling both to maintain her marriage to her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) and to keep her laundromat business afloat. On top of this, her strained relationship with her daughter Joy/Jobu Tupaki (Stephanie Hsu) threatens to unravel the fabric of existence as she knows it. After some exposition, Evelyn is told that she is one of many Evelyns across the multiverse and that she is the only one capable of saving it.
Despite being shot on a moderate budget, once “Everything Everywhere All At Once” began to generate buzz, it could not be stopped. The film is beautifully shot, with impeccable coloring and detail throughout the 139 minute run time. Watching the film in theaters was an experience unlike any other. Viewers walked out having formed tacit bonds with the rest of the audience. They screamed, cried, laughed, and held their breaths together. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” kept its prominence because watching it was an experience nobody wanted to miss out on.
Another reason for the world’s obsession with the film was its insanity, and more specifically, the ways in which the film asked the audience to find the beauty in its absurdity. Looking at the teary-eyed audience out of context, you would never imagine that they’re watching a movie about evil bagels, googly-eyes, and hot-dog fingers. But this absurdity was only fodder for conversation. Thousands of fans congregated on TikTok to analyze the meaning behind some of the film’s iconically absurd scenes; The three-minute silent rock scene. The reference to the animated 2007 Disney drama “Ratatouille.” The random end-credit scene midway through the film. What does it all mean? And why is it all so beautiful? The compulsion to find answers to these questions made “Everything Everywhere All At Once” incredibly appealing to both audiences and critics.
The third aspect of the film that contributed to its Oscar win was its heartfeltness and relatability. Underneath the intense fighting and confusing action scenes lie moments of true sadness and vulnerability.
“Even though you have broken my heart yet again, I wanted to say, in another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you,” Waymond says to Evelyn in one heart-wrenching scene.
“I have felt everything your daughter has felt and I know the joy and the pain of having you as my mother,” Jobu Tupaki says to Evelyn in another.
Even though the audience might not relate to the life of a verse-jumping Asian man or a lesbian from the Alpha timeline hell-bent on destroying space and time, they can still understand the bittersweetness of an uneasy marriage or the complexities of a mother-daughter relationship.
It is impossible to discuss this Oscar sweep, of course, without touching on the significance of this win. It proves not only that Hollywood is changing — maybe for the better — but also that American audiences are changing too. They are willing and eager to watch a hectic, beautiful film about a Chinese immigrant family that is partly in Mandarin and Cantonese. Not only are they willing to watch it, but they learn to absolutely love it.
Overall, “Everything Everywhere All At Once” swept the Oscars because it did all the right things. It was a welcome burst of creativity and otherworldliness in a time when people were looking for a way to disconnect from the stillness of a post-pandemic world. Audiences loved the film for its experience, its insanity, its beauty, and its love. “Everything Everywhere All At Once” is changing the awards landscape for the better, and audiences need to strap in and get excited.

“Atalanta,” an original musical written by Mira-Rose J. Kingsbury Lee ’24, will run at the Loeb Experimental Theatre from April 6 to April 9. Co-directed by Kingsbury Lee and Ellie M. Powell ’25, the story follows Sarina Lemonde (Grace H. Allen ’24), a young newspaper editor working in a male-dominated newsroom in New York City in 1969. She finds herself in a difficult position when she unexpectedly becomes President of the “Atalanta Post.”
“Atalanta” opens with a busy newsroom scene filled with peppy music. Men clad in plaid pants and women in jewel tones fill the scene: “Who’s who in the news?” they ask. Costume designer Stephanie S. Brecq ’24 dove into the Pinterest world of 1960s fashion to outfit the cast. She describes Sarina’s mother Miriam Lamonde’s outfits as “super high fashion, European but she’s like kind of fake so it’s brought to the nth degree.”
While this may be the musical’s debut, Kingsbury Lee has been thinking about Sarina Lemonde for a decade. She began developing Sarina’s story in middle school. In this first iteration, though, Sarina wasn’t in a New York newsroom, but a futuristic Greco-Roman world. The title does, after all, pay homage to the Ancient Greek heroine Atalanta.
But Kingsbury Lee kept “searching for a place for” Sarina. That’s when she read the autobiography of Katharine Graham, the former publisher of “The “Washington Post” and felt “enchanted” by Graham’s story.
“She’s a really peculiar character,” Kingsbury Lee said of Graham. But Graham’s story embodied the growth that occurred in Kingsbury Lee’s own main character, Sarina. Thus, Sarina was born into the newsroom.
As a musical, “Atalanta” went through several stages of development — from a workshop at Kingsbury Lee’s high school to an online performance during the Covid-19 quarantine — to reach the state it is in today.
The production of the musical at the Loeb Ex aims to present a variety of complex characters and a myriad of relationship dynamics. Viewers will watch as Sarina navigates feelings towards her mother, the bombshell French movie star Miriam Lamonde (Onovughakpor M. Otitigbe-Dangerfield ’25) as well as her husband, Charlie Saltman (Matthew J. Given ’25).
Cast member Louis A. Zekowski ’23, who plays the “emotionally volatile” newspaper editor Jack Harding, described “Atalanta” as “something unlike anything I had ever seen before.”
Propelled by a lean cast of nine, the music features rhymes and spoken songs reminiscent of Harold Hill in “The Music Man” or rap segments in “Hamilton,” as well as jazzy, upbeat tunes with violin, drums, piano, and saxophone. Vocal music director Henry H. Wu ’25 described the variety of music as including songs that are “lighthearted” and songs that have “more emotional punch.”
“So much of the music for this is going to be exhilarating and new and something that audiences aren't expecting,” said Zekowski.
Wu says he hopes viewers will be reminded of “joy” and “the peak of human emotion” when listening to the music in “Atalanta.”
The lyrics make biblical, classical, and historical allusions. Despite, or perhaps because of, its ties to history, the musical addresses issues prevalent in today’s world from the vantage point of 1969.
Kingsbury Lee said she hopes “Atalanta” will bring audiences to recognize that “you really are what you make of yourself,” and that a person’s background does not have to define their future.

Harvard is full of ducks.
Not the long-billed, webbed-footed birds, but the students who maintain a superficial aura of tranquility. Coined at Stanford University — but still very much applicable to Harvard — the term “Stanford Duck Syndrome” posits that while students appear to be as calm as a duck floating across a pond, under the surface they are paddling furiously to keep up with the competitive and rigorous college environment.
In my pre-orientation program sessions, meetings with my advisers, and conversations with my peers, I was often warned not to follow the duck calls prevalent at Harvard. Advice like joining only three clubs and taking a ‘manageable’ course load was supposed to keep me, and my peers, truly coasting along, instead of just pretending to.
But well-meaning advice is not enough to lessen the stress of college.
It’s difficult to avoid jumping headfirst into Harvard life and its pressure cooker environment. Many ducks want to just start paddling: doing summer comps for competitive clubs, or reading ahead for difficult classes.
In the first few weeks of classes, I dreadfully observed nearly the entire first-year cohort trying to demonstrate that they were Harvard material. Numerous students worked late nights to finish club presentations, others began the task of producing perfect problem sets, and everyone’s Google Calendars rapidly started filling up.
Unfortunately, plunging headfirst into the waterways of Harvard creates the perfect recipe for unmanageable stress.
Stress triggers a natural human reaction. When one encounters stressful stimuli, their amygdala, the emotional center of their brain, signals the hypothalamus, their body’s control center, to release the hormone adrenaline. This circulating adrenaline causes one’s heart to beat faster and one to breathe harder, ultimately putting them in a heightened state of alertness and energy. Subsequently, the hormone cortisol is released, ensuring that this response is sustained as long as the stress threat continues to exist.
But experiencing the stress response for too long can lead to health problems, such as anxiety, higher blood pressure, heart issues, obesity, depression, and diabetes.
Yet some students thrive — or at least claim to thrive — under high stress. This short-term, productive “eustress” takes advantage of the body’s fight-or-flight response to energize and motivate, helping people focus before exams or pushing them to challenge themselves academically and in extracurriculars.
Stress can manifest as positive eustress or its negative cousin distress depending on the person. Situations that are exciting for some students can be disastrous for others. This explains why some ducks are happy to swim intensely, while others float passively: Your stress response is based on your perception of the situation.
Take the ubiquitously employed art of procrastination. While some students, myself included, find delaying work to be unnecessarily stressful, others routinely procrastinate, following the philosophy that a paper due at 11:59 p.m. really only needs to be started at 10 p.m — perhaps even chugging caffeine or shifting their sleep cycle to meet such late-night deadlines.
Procrastination is an interesting biological phenomenon resulting from a conflict between the limbic system, responsible for our quick emotional responses, and the prefrontal cortex, responsible for complex decision-making. The limbic system can short-circuit the prefrontal cortex’s rational decision-making to drive one to push off unenjoyable work.
At its core, procrastination is employed to avoid the distress of work, but this behavior can actually be maladaptive. Eventually, one will need to complete their delayed task, at which time they may become incredibly stressed. A well-established study from 1997 even demonstrated that while students who habitually procrastinated were initially less stressed, by the end of the semester, they were more stressed, and overall they performed worse than their non-procrastinating peers.
It may be difficult to cut the habit of procrastination. Many students believe that they perform well only when they are pressurized and taking advantage of motivating eustress. But this belief blinds them to the potential deleterious consequences of later distress.
Being aware of stress in your daily life can help you live happier and healthier. While it may be difficult to distinguish between eu- and distress initially, a positive mindset can help you better deal with stressors in your daily life and harness the power of eustress without falling prey to distress.
Any discussion of college stress would be incomplete without mentioning the resources available to help students deal with high-intensity college environments’ negative consequences on mental health. A recent uptick in suicidal ideation among college students indicates the growing need to help students better manage stress in its associations to mental illness. Utilizing college and peer counseling may be a good start, but these systems require reforms — some of which are outlined in my peer’s column “Demystifying Therapy.”
As you move through Harvard, take a moment to slow down and think about the things that, as Marie Kondo would put it, “spark joy” for you. Instead of focusing on the ripples made by the ducks around you, it is important to focus on doing your best — even if that’s floating instead of paddling. Amongst a raft of ducks, sometimes it’s best to be a goose!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When choosing classes for the upcoming academic year, Harvard students will notice a long-awaited addition to the course catalog. For the first time in the University’s storied history, Filipino — the standardized form of Tagalog, currently the fourth most spoken primary language in the United States — will appear as a course offering.
Last week, the Department of South Asian Studies announced that it will hire three preceptors to teach Filipino, Bahasa Indonesian, and Thai; Harvard already offers the latter two in a tutorial format. We are grateful for this effort to institutionalize the study of Southeast Asian languages, and we specifically thank students from the Harvard Philippine Forum and affiliates of the Asia Center for their years-long advocacy around course offerings, without which it is highly unlikely that the University would have ever taken action.
With thousands of languages and dialects employed daily around the globe, it is unreasonable to expect Harvard to offer instruction in all the world’s tongues. Still, while there is no perfect framework to determine exactly which languages should be taught, we do expect the University to follow basic guidelines when making such decisions — particularly because other educational institutions look to Harvard as a model when deciding what vernaculars are worthy of study.
Both demonstrated student interest and national popularity of a language should be taken into account when determining which languages to offer; Filipino indisputably meets both these criteria. However, this isn’t a new development, as decades of student advocates — and nearly two million current Tagalog speakers in the United States — can attest.
Considering that the value of learning obscure, archaic, or even dead languages has never been questioned by the University, we find it damning that students were faced with silence for years as they lobbied Harvard to offer a single course in one of the most commonly-spoken tongues in the nation. A commitment to veritas in language learning, it seems, was restricted to the decaying domain of the term’s provenance rather than extending to the living, breathing tongues of today.
Recognizing this egregious gap in Harvard’s curricular offerings, the addition of Filipino to the course catalog should be paired with proactive efforts by the University to establish a Southeast Asian Studies department and to hire more professors that focus on the region across departments. Currently, there is only one professor in the History Department whose field of specialization is South Asian and Southeast Asian history. If Harvard intends to maintain its position as a leading research institution with premier, cutting-edge scholarship on emerging global issues, it must further expand its offerings on this historically rich and increasingly strategic area of the world, especially given Yale and Princeton’s already-existing curricula dedicated to the region.
And while we enthusiastically welcome scholars of the region within the nascent field of Ethnic Studies, we also hope that Harvard does not simply lump all academic work on historically-underrepresented fields into this one program. Rather, a dedicated Southeast Asian Studies department, in addition to more scholarship within existing fields, is necessary to ensure that all cultures and histories receive adequate engagement, funding, and resources.
Although the offering of Filipino may be particularly meaningful to students with heritage connections to the Philippines, we urge students with no prior knowledge of the language to also consider enrolling this upcoming academic year. The “transformative experience” that Harvard promises is only possible when we diversify our awareness of available knowledge by engaging with a kaleidoscope of perspectives — something which foreign language study is uniquely equipped to enable.
As Harvard turns over a new page in its centuries-long history, we hope the momentum of the offering of Filipino will push the University to redress its enduring, conspicuous lack of curricular coverage for an entire region of the globe. Even as we remain unsatisfied with Harvard’s course catalog, however, we applaud vocal students, dedicated faculty, and visionary staff for pushing the University to rearticulate its commitment to Veritas in an entirely new tongue. To them, we say: salamat.

There is no good word for scrapbooks made out of obituaries.
Robert “Bob” J. Quinn, who started cutting obituaries out of newspapers in 1983, originally called them his “AIDS Memorial Books.” He completed 26 volumes, containing more than 7,000 obituaries in total.
The memorial books, now digitized, are a testament to loss and remembrance. HIV/AIDS killed many, many people during the epidemic that spanned the 1980s and 1990s. Since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, an estimated 675,000 Americans have died from the disease. More than 40 years later, it is apparent that we will never know the name of every American who died of AIDS.
Combing through Quinn’s memorial books, what sticks out most to me is that he literally highlighted people who were never in the headlines, their names in oranges, pinks, and yellows, with years of deaths written in blue, red, or black in the margins — loss in technicolor. Reading these obituaries and annotations provides a stark and painful reminder of persistent loss; when going through the memorial books, it becomes almost overwhelming.
Quinn himself had AIDS, and spent time as a patient at the Hospice at Mission Hill in Boston. John J. Podolske, Quinn’s eventual healthcare proxy, met Quinn as a volunteer at Mission Hill in 1992. As Podolske said of Quinn, he was “the type of person you never forget.”
“​​He did those books because he wanted to make sure everybody got remembered, and he knew a lot of people that passed away too,” Podolske explained.
“He didn’t want the AIDS crisis to be pushed as a non-memory thing. That’s why he did the remembrance books, and he did it for as long as he could,” he added.
Quinn pored over newspapers, carefully clipping obituaries for the blur of names, faces, and too-young ages dead from the disease he was struggling with. The obituaries were sometimes for people Quinn knew personally, friends now reduced to a few biographical lines.
Quinn kept persisting in this exercise, knowing that his own name could end up in the obituary section one day yet likely never a memorial book. Podolske witnessed Quinn “right up near the end” as “he kept going on those books, collecting those obituaries, making sure nobody was forgotten.”
“Those books were one of his high priorities,” Podolske said.
Patients at Mission Hill typically had six months or less to live. Quinn “way outlasted six months,” according to Podolske.
***
Podolske described one of Quinn’s other favorite things to do: acquiring collector plates. “There wasn’t a week that went by that he didn’t get a collector’s plate in the mail,” Podolske said.
However, after six months, Podolske said he saw a change in Quinn: “I think he started getting depressed being in there, with watching everybody come in and die around him and he was still around.”
So Quinn left.
“The room he was in was on the higher side of the building,” Podolske described. “So, this one morning, he just hung himself out the window and dropped, something like a 12-foot drop, and he ran down and took off.”
Quinn ended up on an Amtrak train to his hometown, Albany, N.Y. After he was eventually brought back to the hospice, it was determined that he was “too well” to be a patient there anymore.
In lieu of continuing to stay at the hospice, Quinn was moved to an apartment across from Symphony Hall, where he became known for his annual Christmas parties — each party his “last,” since Quinn didn’t know when AIDS would finally kill him. As Podolske remembered, “I think we ended up having eight annual Last Christmas parties before he finally died.”

When Quinn died in 2002 — far outlasting the six months that Mission Hill had expected — Podolske ended up taking care of his estate, sorting through Quinn’s specific instructions on distributing his plate collection. Podolske, a Vietnam War veteran, got a plate commemorating the Vietnam War.
After Quinn’s funeral, his friends and family held a “big party at his apartment” — which felt more like a celebration of life rather than a rumination on death.
“He wanted people to live, that’s really what it was,” Podolske said.
All these years later, Pat Gibbons still remembers Quinn. She remembers him collecting the plates (she believes she received one commemorating Ellis Island), and assembling the memorial books. When I asked her what she remembers from the Christmas parties, she said, “They were wild. I mean, he was just so funny,” emphasizing the words.
Gibbons opened the Hospice at Mission Hill in 1989, serving as its first director. The hospice was intended as a place for people in their final stages battling with AIDS to pass in peace. Through my interviews about the hospice, one phrase kept coming up — that Mission Hill was a “special” place.
For many patients with HIV/AIDS during this time, hospices provided a sense of comfort and acceptance which was difficult to come by; people with the disease were often stigmatized, and even rejected by their friends and families. Liz Kass, one of the first medical directors of Mission Hill, described the importance of providing housing and medical assistance for vulnerable, particularly unhoused and marginalized, populations: “People who would come from shelters or prison, or just sort of ‘street existence,’ you put them in a room, you actually gave them their medication regularly, and fed them. And lo and behold, although they looked like they were dying when we admitted them, they weren’t with a little bit of housing and care.”
“Shocker, right?” she added.
As Brad A. Gregory, the former head chef at the hospice who worked at Mission Hill from its opening to its closing, told me, “We were determined to make the place a home. We had an army of volunteers, people in the community who just said, ‘I want to help, how can I help?’”
Gregory’s culinary creations worked to make the hospice more of a home. “I started doing holidays […] we’d do crepes and pancakes and all sorts of things on Mardi Gras […] and Christmas and Thanksgiving and Opening Day at Fenway Park, anything I could think of to make a themed luncheon or dinner,” he said.
The hospice also had some notable visitors. When Elizabeth R. Taylor, a prominent AIDS philanthropist and actor, was in Boston promoting a new perfume, she pulled Gibbons aside and expressed her desire to come visit the Hospice at Mission Hill.
“And she did,” Gibbons said. “Liz Taylor came and spent the entire afternoon and met with every single resident.”
Baba Ram Dass, a guru and psychology researcher at Harvard who led the countercultural push for psychedelics, also visited the hospice.
“I was awestruck in his presence. He would stop into the kitchen and have tea with me,” described Gregory.
For many of the employees and volunteers at the hospice, their endeavor in caring for patients with HIV/AIDS was deeply personal.
As Gregory said, “Many of my close friends came to the hospice and ended their lives there.”
Although he noted that these tragedies happened at different points in his life, Gregory remarked, “I did two tours of Vietnam in the late 60s, early 70s, and the AIDS epidemic was my trial by fire. I have to say, the war was less emotionally taxing.”
Even dealing with death, the staff of the hospice wanted to practice comfort and honor. As Gibbons described, “What we always did was when someone died, that room would remain quiet for 24 hours after the death, and we would make a point of putting something that either meant something to that person or something that would remind us of that person in that space for that period of time, to honor the fact that they were there.” They would also place a candle and a card for the person who had passed near the entrance of the hospice.
Mission Hill needed to both honor losses and maintain a hopeful environment for current patients.
“There were a lot of really lovely things and a lot of really difficult things,” Kass, the former medical director, said.
Looking through Quinn’s digitized memorial books hurts. Conversations play out on the cut-out pages, as families describe the lives and wishes of the deceased and hope they are now in a better place. But this can only ever be a one-way conversation.
As the years inch on and we move further away from the start of the AIDS epidemic, we risk remembering only statistics. But numbers cannot communicate the personal nature of loss. An empty seat at a breakfast table or a side of the bed no longer used cannot be felt in a minus sign. What’s missing from the equation is grief and loneliness: love with nowhere to go but to a beneficiary six feet underground or sitting on a mantle.
When I look at the memorial books, I think of all the parts of people’s lives that couldn't fit inside the word limit of a newspaper obituary announcing that they died of AIDS. When thinking about Quinn himself, I think of his Christmas parties and his plate collection, undercurrents of joy and hope which revealed so much more about who he was than a simple line about a diagnosis. I think about the employees and volunteers who gave so much of themselves to the Hospice at Mission Hill, and how they showed up to help some of Boston’s most marginalized and vulnerable.
Learning from their examples, we must work to show up for people in our own communities, to see the life of each person around us as the complex tapestry it is. From supporting people with HIV/AIDS today to ensuring that places like Mission Hill can be created in the future, caring about the most vulnerable members of our communities starts now.
***
The Hospice at Mission Hill has long since closed. But the ways in which it helped people both live and die must be remembered.
During our interview about what it was like working at the hospice, Gregory told me, “You don’t get prepared for letting go of the people that you’ve become a very intimate friend with over an intense period of time.”
The quiet over the phone was loud.
He continued: “I say that and in the silence here, faces come up. Faces that I remember very intensely.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Undergraduate Association officers discussed plans to co-sponsor an “Intersectional Earth Week” in collaboration with the Harvard Climate Coalition at the body’s weekly general meeting Sunday.
Intersectional Earth Week, which will be held between April 17 and 22, aims to teach Harvard College students about sustainability practices and inform them about the different ways diverse groups are affected by climate change, according to HUA Co-President John S. Cooke ’25.
“It’s designed to inform students about how the climate crisis impacts different identities,” Cooke said. “We’re going to be a co-signer on this and we’re going to help them out with any spaces they need to secure and with pubbing their events.”
Other Harvard organizations involved in Intersectional Earth Week are the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics, the Phillips Brooks House Association, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, and the newly formed Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.
The officers also discussed new diversity initiatives, proposed modifications to leave of absence policies, and provided funding updates.
Inclusion Officer Ashley C. Adirika ’26 said she plans to begin holding bimonthly “Reform, Inclusion, Student Needs, and Engagement” chats to invite current students to share suggestions for DEI initiatives.
Adirika said she will also collaborate with other stakeholders on campus to provide guidance to students navigating Harvard’s Financial Aid Office. The assistance would include help with filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and the CSS Profile, used for institutional aid. The deadline for Harvard students to renew their financial aid is May 1.
Well-Being Officer Allison M. Hunter ’26 discussed an initiative to adjust the College’s leave of absence policies by granting students greater access to on-campus resources and allowing them full autonomy to choose when to return to campus.
Currently, College leave policies prohibit unenrolled students from participating in campus activities or using most Harvard resources. Students who take a voluntary or involuntary leave for medical reasons must petition the Administrative Board to return to campus, according to the College’s handbook.
“Changing leaves of absence policies is something that is going to be long-term,” Hunter said. “However, I really am interested in starting this process because of what I’ve heard from students who are on leaves of absences.”
Hunter also said she hopes to increase the awareness and availability of campus mental health resources by holding forums about mental health and wellness events on campus and increasing well-being resources and alternatives for Harvard-based therapy.
Social Life Officer Jonathan Haileselassie ’26 presented recently approved allocations of $1,000 in funding to Eleganza, the Woodbridge Spring Formal, and the Harvard Islamic Society Eid Banquet.
The Social Life Fund has roughly $1,326 remaining after the three allocations.
“Each of these events combined, I believe, serve 2,000 plus students, so it’s a large segment of the population,” Haileselassie said. “And they’re also really good at just celebrating our diversity, and making sure that all students from all sorts of identities feel accepted and safe on this campus.”
Another initiative would create opportunities to take a temporary break from campus and academia by providing access to LYFT vouchers after 10 p.m. for students in a seven-mile radius of campus.

Harvard College plans to increase tuition and expand financial aid for the 2023-24 academic year, raising the threshold for cost-free attendance to $85,000 a year, according to a press release Thursday.
The change in financial aid — a $10,000 increase from last year’s threshold of $75,000 — comes as the College plans to raise the total cost of attendance by 3.5 percent to $79,450.
“Building on its long-standing commitment to increasing opportunity for all talented students regardless of their economic resources, the University is announcing another expansion of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) for low- and middle-income families,” the Admissions and Financial Aid Office wrote in its announcement.
The Admissions and Financial Aid Office estimated that roughly 25 percent of families will not have to contribute to tuition, room, or board due to the expansion.
Families making under $85,000 annually will also receive a $2,000 stipend for “move-in costs and other expenses incurred in the transition to College,” continuing an initiative first launched by the College in 2016.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 called the changes to the College’s financial aid program “revolutionary,” citing the stipend and the reduced student earnings expectation.
“I, as a first-generation, huge financial aid recipient, am thrilled with what the College was able to do,” Fitzsimmons said in an interview Thursday. “And the context of it is a very challenging financial picture in the country and in the world right now.”
The College first eliminated the student summer work expectation from financial aid rewards in 2020, replacing it with scholarship funds. Last year, the College increased the threshold to $75,000 from $65,000 and provided a $2,000 grant to students whose family income fell below the threshold.
“The further expansion of our financial aid program underscores our continued, unwavering commitment to making Harvard affordable for all deserving students,” said Director of Financial Aid Jake Kaufmann ’93 in Thursday’s press release.
The College’s total cost of attendance — which currently sits at $76,763 for the 2022-23 academic year — has also risen steadily in the past decade. The College typically hikes tuition by around 3 to 4 percent each year.
More than $3 billion has been awarded in undergraduate financial aid since the creation of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which was established in 2004 and seeks to “raise awareness of college affordability for students interested in all kinds of colleges and universities.”
Prior to expansions of the financial aid program made in 2022 and 2023, the College last increased financial aid during the 2012-13 academic year.

Sociologists and other experts discussed how Ukrainian refugees have been received by neighboring European countries in a panel hosted by Harvard’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies on Monday.
The panel featured speakers from Germany and Poland in conversation with Viktoriya Sereda — a Ukrainian sociologist and the director of the research group PRISMA UKRAÏNA — to share the Ukrainian perspective. The event, which was moderated by the Executive Director of the Davis Center Alexandra M. Vacroux, began with a short presentation from each of the three speakers before opening up into a discussion.
According to Sereda, the number of Ukrainian refugees seeking asylum in Europe is over 5 million, most of whom are women.
Wolfgang J. Hummel — head of legal affairs at the Ukraine Refugee Reception Center — spoke about the German national response to the refugee crisis, highlighting how Ukrainian refugees have access to special benefits in Germany, such as child care and online classes.
“Ukrainian refugees are treated differently and they are allowed to decide where to settle,” Hummel said. “We have, what we all know, this European Temporary Protection Directive, which includes this freedom of movement — also in Germany, access to social benefits from day one.”
Sereda noted that based on data from a survey conducted by PRISMA UKRAÏNA, Ukrainian refugees are successfully integrating into German society.
“If you look at Germany, the absolute priority is learning the language, recognition of professional status and education, finding a job, and renting a long-term apartment,” Sereda said. “So we do observe that this group is demonstrating aspirations of joining the German work market.”
Jakub Isański, professor of sociology at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poland, shared findings about education and migration from his research, which collected responses from more than 500 Ukrainian refugees.
“There are also over 200,000 Ukrainian children attending Polish schools, many primary schools, which creates another opportunity but also challenge for the system to reorganize the number of teachers that are able to speak Ukrainian,” Isański said.
Isański also talked about a “feminized scale” of migration, which forced women to leave Ukraine while their male counterparts remained in the country.
“Families were divided, usually with mothers, wives, women in general, who were forced to flee and their husbands, brothers, sons had to stay in Ukraine,” he said.
The speakers later opened the floor for discussion, focusing on the language barrier among refugees and their country of relocation.
Vacroux put forward a question about the “German obligation to learn the language before you get the job,” raising a concern that the language barrier inhibits integration.
In response, Hummel clarified that without language training, refugees “will never have a good job” and may end up working in informal sectors at low wages.
When asked if they had noticed anything significant that had changed a year into the war, Sereda observed from her interviews that many had previously decided to not invest in integration as they were hoping to return to Ukraine soon.
“And the reason was that ‘Why invest in learning German or invest in integration if we are leaving soon?’ But starting from late summer to early autumn, it became quite obvious that this conflict is protracted for quite a longer time,” Sereda said. “They were saying that now we understand that we cannot be home soon and we have to invest much more into all these activities.”
To conclude the event, Hummel said there is “a new refugee status which we haven’t experienced in this extent in the past” due to the “high mobility” of refugees who can travel back and forth from Ukraine and Germany.
“But again, based on our experience, we expect that over 50 percent — already today — decides their future lies in West Germany or another EU country,” he said.

Philanthropist David M. Rubenstein — a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — discussed leadership lessons from his experience in private equity and public service at a Harvard Institute of Politics Forum Monday evening.
The event was moderated by Kennedy School professors Meghan L. O’Sullivan and Graham T. Allison Jr. ’62, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Policy and Plans. The talk was co-sponsored by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
During the event, Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group, shared anecdotes from his career, his thoughts on education, and how he discovered his passion for private equity.
Rubenstein has made donations totaling more than $700 million to charitable causes during his lifetime, including many to historical museums and monuments such as the Smithsonian, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial — a practice he called “patriotic philanthropy.”
Rubenstein said he hopes to help people remember the history and heritage of the United States, emphasizing the importance of learning from past mistakes to build a better future.
“You study the mistakes of the past so you can correct them for a better future. The civilization can progress by learning mistakes and correcting them,” he said.
Discussing the decline of history majors in the United States, Rubenstein posited the push towards STEM degrees has crowded out students’ potential interest in history. He emphasized the need to convince people that studying history does not equate to unemployment.
“When I look at people, I never look at what they major in,” he said. “I look at how they talk, can they communicate, that they have a sense of personality, if I think they’ve learned how to write.”
Rubenstein encouraged students to explore different fields of study to find a subject they care deeply about.
“Experiment with many different things. I did four or five different things before I found what I really like,” he said. “You should all find something that you really love. Nobody has ever won a Nobel Prize hating what they did.”
“As a general rule of thumb I just don’t think there’s anything more you can do that supports your early stage of life than getting a good education. If you are highly educated, you are more likely to do things with your life that are going to be interesting,” Rubenstein added.
IOP JFK Jr. Forum Co-Chair Robert Fogel ’25 said he appreciated Rubenstein’s diverse set of experiences and focus on passionate learning.
“When you look at his career path, particularly for a lot of students who are very unsure about their own careers, I think it offers them a lot of reassurance and guidance in knowing just to follow your passion,” Fogel said.
Rubenstein also encouraged audience members to find ways to become involved in public service.
“Public service is a great way to give back to your country. And I think everybody ought to think about what you can do to give back to your country in some modest way,” Rubenstein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed an amended policy order to implement city recommendations to improve traffic safety on Garden Street in West Cambridge during a virtual meeting Monday.
The policy order, passed in a 6-3 vote, orders the city manager to direct the Department of Public Works and the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department to carry out a list of recommendations developed by the agencies over the past five months through “listening sessions” with local residents to enhance Garden Street.
In October and November of 2022, 1.25 miles of separated bike lanes were constructed along Garden Street to meet the goals of the amended Cycling Safety Ordinance — a rule initially introduced in April 2019 and amended in June 2020 to expand bike lanes in Cambridge. As a result of the new lanes, traffic on Garden Street switched from two-way to one-way, and many parking spots were eliminated.
At meetings following the construction last year, some Cambridge residents praised the changes to Garden Street while others said the redesigned street was unsafe.
In response to residents’ concerns, on Nov. 14, the council voted on a policy order to ask the Department of Public Works and the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department to conduct several “listening sessions” and monitor the traffic situation on Garden Street before assembling a list of traffic safety recommendations to present to the council by March 27 of this year.
The amended policy order passed in Monday’s meeting also included a request for an impact evaluation on returning part of Garden Street to two-way traffic.
Some Cambridge residents opposed Monday’s policy order, saying the Council should stay out of affairs that they said belong rightfully to traffic authorities.
“City councilors should not be in the practice of dictating roadway design. Please leave that to our very capable traffic engineers,” local resident Mark Boswell said.
Councilor Paul F. Toner said he supported the initial version, adding the order is well within the council’s jurisdiction.
“No, we’re not engineers; however, we are elected officials and our job is to listen to the people in the community and bring their concerns to the table,” he said.
Toner, however, said he did not support the policy order as amended.
“The original policy order that they brought forward with councilor Nolan, Simmons, and Carlone, directly addressed the concerns that have been brought up by the residents of the neighborhood,” he said.
According to the order, the Department of Public Works and the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department must implement its recommendations “as soon as possible” and no later than May 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2023, at 6:01 p.m.
At least five armed Harvard University Police Department officers raided an undergraduate suite in Leverett House in response to a false 911 call about an armed individual in the suite early Monday morning.
The four Harvard College seniors in the suite, who are Black, awoke to the sound of banging on their door. Moments later, HUPD officers ordered them into the hallway at gunpoint.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said in an interview that Harvard University Police were dispatched to the building after a report “threatening violence against occupants.” The officers searched the Leverett House suite with “negative results for an individual with a firearm or any persons acting in a suspicious manner,” Catalano said.
At the time of the raid, seniors Jarah K. Cotton ’23, Jazmin N. Dunlap ’23, David G. Madzivanyika ’23, and Alexandra C. René ’23 were in the suite, according to Cotton, who said she was woken around 4 a.m. by the sound of banging and commands to “open up.”
The bangs were so loud that Birukti Tsige ’23, who was asleep in the suite across the hall from where the raid occurred, said she initially thought “the knocks are coming from our side.”
Cotton said when she peered out of her room, she saw an HUPD officer in riot gear holding an assault rifle had already entered their suite.
According to Cotton, the officers, with their rifles pointed at the students, instructed them to exit their rooms with their hands raised. She said the students were then escorted to a neighboring suite.
“All I can recall having in my mind is ‘I haven’t done anything,’” Cotton said. “I really had no clue why they were raiding our suite.”
“It was a very crazy experience — and terrifying,” she added.
After she and her roommates were led into another suite, Cotton said an officer came to them and explained that a false report had led HUPD to believe there was an active threat in the building.
Catalano confirmed that the students were briefed by officers about the false report.
“We were all extremely scared, particularly because my roommates and I are Black students who have been bombarded our whole lives with stories and images portraying how situations such as this had ended up terribly,” Cotton wrote in an email to The Crimson Monday. “We felt our lives were in danger. We are traumatized.”
Tsige said she grabbed her phone and began recording the situation as officers directed the students from Cotton’s suite into her own, their hands raised. She added that she was concerned because Cotton and her suitemates are Black.
“I was really, really scared, but I feel like that was nothing compared to how the other suite felt,” Tsige said.
According to Cotton, HUPD called her and René roughly 30 minutes before the raid, but they did not answer their phones due to the late hour.
The false report was an apparent example of “swatting” — the act of placing a false emergency call with the intention of harassing a target by provoking a forceful police response.
These hoax calls — named after the armed SWAT teams that typically respond to them — have increasingly targeted schools across the country in recent months. NBC10 Boston reported that 28 Massachusetts communities received swatting calls in the aftermath of a March 27 school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, including false threats that led to lockdowns and police responses at six high schools.
FBI spokesperson Kristen M. Setera confirmed Tuesday that the FBI is aware of the false police report and is coordinating with HUPD on the matter.
Leverett House Interim Resident Dean John Nowak and Faculty Deans Daniel G. Deschler and Eileen E. Reynolds ’86 emailed students at 10:20 a.m. Monday, briefly describing the raid and reiterating that no immediate threat to House safety existed.
“We all process activities like this morning’s differently,” the deans wrote. “Please check in with yourself and on each other and let us know if you have any concerns for yourself or your fellow community members.”
The email offered several support resources including the Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services support line. The deans also hosted a gathering Monday evening for students to discuss the raid, which Cotton said she appreciated.
“It at least gave students who had become privy to the situation, or who had heard it, the opportunity to hear what actually happened,” Cotton said.
“As for the people who were involved in the raid specifically, we did have a lot of questions that we tried to pose — a lot of them were not answered,” she added.
Despite being assured of their safety, Tsige said that she and her suitemates were on edge for the remainder of the night, startled by every small noise.
“I was thankfully able to fall asleep, but some of my suitemates weren’t,” Tsige said, adding that she didn’t attend any of her classes for the rest of the day.
Cotton said she was disappointed by the lack of University-wide response or acknowledgment.
“Being accosted in your place of residence warrants a University-wide response, warrants the president’s attention, warrants the dean of students’ attention, warrants an email, at the very least,” Cotton said.
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on the raid.
“At least tell people what happened, tell people about swatting,” Cotton added. “Students are learning about this via Sidechat and other social media platforms. I don’t think that’s how things should be done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal judge on Monday allowed a majority of the counts in a lawsuit filed last year against Harvard alleging that the University ignored sexual harassment and retaliation complaints against professor John L. Comaroff to proceed while dismissing one count.
In an 81-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Judith G. Dein wrote that the May 2020 Crimson investigation into allegations against Comaroff and two other senior Anthropology professors, as well as subsequent reporting by The Chronicle of Higher Education, “support a finding that Harvard engaged in a long-term pattern and practice of indifference to complaints of sexual harassment against professors in that Department.”
Dein denied most of Harvard’s motion to dismiss nine of 10 counts of the lawsuit. She dismissed count three, writing that “plaintiffs have failed to allege plausible claims against Harvard for gender discrimination under Title IX.”
Last week, Dein denied Harvard’s motion for summary judgment on the 10th count, which alleges Harvard violated Kilburn’s privacy by obtaining and distributing her private therapy notes as part of an internal investigation. In her ruling, Dein wrote Harvard’s arguments were “unpersuasive” and that the “facts are sufficient” to support Kilburn’s claim that the University illegally breached its fiduciary duty.
A total of nine counts of the lawsuit will proceed to discovery.
The plaintiffs — Anthropology graduate students Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava — first sued Harvard in February 2022, claiming that Harvard was aware of complaints about Comaroff’s alleged misconduct as a faculty member at the University of Chicago when he was hired in 2012 and mishandled reports of sexual harassment and professional retaliation since then.
The suit was amended in June to include additional allegations of sexual harassment from Comaroff’s time as a professor at UChicago. Comaroff and his lawyers have consistently denied all allegations of misconduct made against him.
Over the summer, Harvard asked the court to dismiss counts one through nine of the lawsuit, which claim Harvard’s response to complaints against the professor violated federal law.
On a count-by-count basis, Dein refuted the University’s arguments, except for count three. On count one — which alleged the University maintained “a policy and practice of deliberate indifference” — Dein wrote that “the issue whether Harvard acted with deliberate indifference must await further development of the record.”
Dein rejected Harvard’s argument that the plaintiffs failed to “plausibly” allege Harvard had “a policy and practice of deliberate indifference to sexual misconduct in the Anthropology Department.”
Dein wrote that Comaroff’s stature as a leader in his field, as well as the plaintiffs’ allegation that “no one in a position of authority at Harvard” was “willing” to confront him, meant the plaintiff’s allegations were “sufficient to satisfy” a standard of “severe and pervasive” conduct — a legal requirement for claiming a “hostile educational environment” under Title IX regulations.
“A factfinder could reasonably conclude that Comaroff’s threats against graduate students in his Department were severe enough, and so pervaded their educational environment, that they undermined the victims’ educational opportunities,” she wrote.
Dein similarly rejected Harvard’s arguments of dismissing counts two and four through nine, which included Harvard’s assertion that the statute of limitations on some of the charges had expired.
Dein, however, dismissed count three of the lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs alleged that Harvard engaged in gender discrimination and argued that the University’s Title IX policies are structurally biased against women.
“The problem with the plaintiffs’ theory, however, is that they have failed to allege any facts, as opposed to conclusory allegations, to show that Harvard’s alleged practice of failing to credit complaints of sexual misconduct without independent corroboration applies only to women who file complaints and not to men who file complaints of sexual misconduct,” Dein wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
One of Comaroff’s attorneys, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, wrote in a statement that discovery will show that “the case against Harvard is built on a house of cards.”
“The decision on the motion to dismiss does not reflect factual findings by the court, merely that the court believes the case against Harvard should proceed to discovery,” O’Meara-Costello wrote. “As the case moves forward, we believe the evidence will show that Professor Comaroff did not engage in any of the activities he’s been wrongly accused of.”
The attorneys representing the plaintiffs — Russell L. Kornblith, Sean R. Ouellette ’12, and Carolin Guentert — wrote in a statement that “this ruling is an important victory for our clients and other survivors.” Ouellette is a former Crimson Editorial editor.
“We are pleased that Judge Dein denied Harvard’s attempt to dismiss this case and avoid responsibility, and we look forward to litigating our clients’ claims for sexual harassment and retaliation under Title IX and violations of Massachusetts civil rights statutes and common law,” they wrote. “Our clients showed great courage in speaking up, and this victory should hearten survivors and their advocates everywhere.”
In a statement, Rosalie P. Couture ’26, an organizer with campus advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, wrote that she was “heartened” by the judge’s ruling.
“Survivors of Comaroff’s abuse deserve justice, and Harvard must be held accountable for its role in that abuse,” Couture wrote. “We hope this lawsuit, combined with ongoing direct action, will force Harvard’s leadership to take significant and urgent action.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Goaltender for the Crimson, victor of the Beanpot, and beloved announcer for the Carolina Hurricanes, Tripp Tracy ‘96 has seen it all.
Yet, before Harvard, and before Harvard hockey, Tracy was just any other high schooler: nervous, young, and trying to impress a date.
“I had gone on a date with a senior – I was a freshman at Milton Academy – and she took me to the Beanpot,” Tracy recalled. “And Harvard won it. That was the year they won the national championship, [with] Lane MacDonald and company.”
Harvard had won the Beanpot in 1989, under the direction of captain Lane MacDonald ‘89, a victory that had ended a Beanpot drought lasting more than half a decade. MacDonald would later go on to win the 1989 Hobey Baker Award and was inducted into the Beanpot Hall of Fame in 2014. Tracy, with his elusive date, would later go on to get dumped.
Although the date did not go as well as Tracy would have liked, it lit a more fateful spark than one of simple high school romance: a love for the Beanpot, and more importantly, a love for Harvard.
“Ever since I went to that Beanpot game my freshman year in high school on that date, Harvard's where I wanted to go,” Tracy said.
Ironically enough, while a Beanpot game captained by Lane MacDonald had set Tracy’s dream into motion, it was also one of the key players that had almost stopped it. While better known for his illustrious pursuits on the ice, Lane MacDonald had also graduated to become an assistant coach – just in time for Tracy’s junior year of high school.
“[MacDonald] would come out and do the recruiting. And he came to Michigan a couple of times, and I played beyond awful,” Tracy laughed. “I thought I had no chance, … I blew it every time they came to watch me play.”
At the beginning of Tracy’s senior year, however, MacDonald left coaching to take a job at Alta Communications to work in private equity. Stepping up to fill the gap was Jerry Pawloski ‘88, a fellow Michigander, former Harvard defenseman, and now an assistant coach. More importantly, a fresh set of eyes on Tracy’s game.
“[MacDonald] will be a dear friend of mine for the rest of my life, and thank god he left coaching because I can't imagine he would have ever had high marks for me as a recruit,” Tracy said. “But Jason Karmanos was playing on my team, and he was playing well. So, when [Pawloski] came when he took over for [MacDonald], I finally played well. He came because he – I'm sure he was coming to see [Karmanos] – and that is what really turned for me.”
Tracy played well enough to earn more than a couple of recruiters' eyes on him too. His senior year, Tracy was drafted by the Flyers in the 9th round of the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, whilst also imbued with offers from various university programs. But at the end of the day, Harvard was where his heart truly lay.
“I wanted to go to Harvard ever since, and I knew they had two senior goalies graduating, so there's gonna be a chance to play,” Tracy recalled. “But I had a couple of scholarship offers; [programs] that said, ‘We see you playing X number of games – guarantees, almost – your freshman year’. And Ronn Tomassoni, the only thing he said to me was ‘I can guarantee you the opportunity to compete for the job’ – and I liked that.”
Coach for the men’s hockey program at Harvard from 1989 to 1999, Ronn Tomassoni holds three consecutive regular season titles, an ECAC title, and a Frozen Four appearance. Prior to his role as head coach, he was an assistant coach at Harvard for Bill Cleary starting in 1982, and part of the Crimson’s only national title in 1989.
He had, as Tracy noted, never promised Tracy anything, but the chance and the challenge to compete. Tracy more than took him up on it. His freshman year in 1993, Tracy brought Harvard all the way to the Beanpot finals, and faced off against Boston University at the old Boston Garden – the very opponent he had first watched Harvard play all those years ago on that fateful freshman date.
Speaking of his date, there was an old face in the crowd that night for Tracy.
“I never saw her again, until we were tied with [Boston University] 2-2 after the second period. And I went out to … just cut up my crease at the start of the third period, and I looked back and I saw she was in the fourth row,” Tracy said gleefully. “She dropped me right after that date – and I said, ‘We better win this game!’”
And win they did. Harvard would take down Boston University with a 6-3 victory, crowning themselves as the 1993 Beanpot Champions. It would become one of Tracy’s most cherished memories at Harvard, both for what it meant for himself, but also for what it meant to his team.
“Our upperclassmen had never won. Ted Drury, Matt Malgrave, Steve Flomenhoft – you get emotional just thinking about it,” Tracy sighed. “To be a part of them winning was unbelievable – I'll never forget that night.”
The impact of his teammates, especially that of his upperclassmen, was huge for Tracy. Ted Drury ‘93 was named MVP of the Beanpot tournament and a finalist for the Hobey Baker. A then-prospect for the Calgary Flames, he would later begin an illustrious NHL career. Captain of the team during Tracy’s freshman year, Drury had, at the time, just competed in the 1992 Olympics to play for the USA.
His first course of action upon returning to the team, Tracy recalled, was to treat the freshmen to dinner.
“When I think about Ted, I carry this message,” Tracy said. “I tried to carry it when I was a junior and senior at Harvard, and to this day: the fact that he, an Olympian and a Harvard captain and a future NHLer, treated us truly, immediately, like we were part of the team. And to win the Beanpot and see their joy? That was a memory that will always be with me. Gets me a little choked up even thinking about it.”
Beyond his immediate team, Tracy also recalls the community of Harvard hockey and his great experiences with both upperclassmen and alumni alike.
At the forefront is Lane MacDonald – the former player and assistant coach that had almost put Tracy’s dream at risk. Now, Tracy speaks of him more than fondly. Despite injuries forcing an early retirement from hockey, MacDonald’s career brought him to the 1988 Winter Olympics, the US Hockey Hall of Fame, and various college accolades.
“Lane McDonald, Hobey Baker winner, what a star,” Tracy wondered. “He had neck issues – I think he would have been a great player in the NHL. As humble as they come, and he was everything. He was working in investment banking back in Boston, and he was so good to us.”
In particular, MacDonald also founded and ran the Crimson Hockey School at Martha’s Vineyard, alongside hockey alumni such as Andrew Janfanza ‘88. A terrific highlight to collegiate summers, Tracy recalls great company and greater fun.
“We had a teammate – he was two years ahead of me, would have been a junior when I was a freshman, and his name was Lou Body,” Tracy recounted. “And Lou-Lou came to the Vineyard and he had like – what kind of car – LeBaron, I think. He was from New York, and it had side vinyl paneling on it.”
“[Body] showed up to Martha's Vineyard, and he's like, ‘Yeah, this is the car we're gonna cruise in!’” Tracy laughed. “I looked at him like, ‘Are you kidding us, Lou? We ain’t driving that thing unless it's an absolute last resort.’”
For Tracy, these memories from college are more than just fun anecdotes. They serve also as beautiful reminders of past friendships and teammates, ones that Tracy continues to cherish.
In particular, Tracy speaks fondly of teammate Michel Briestroff ‘95, a French defenseman who’d also played a role in welcoming the freshmen during Ted Drury’s captainly tenure. Tracy and Briestroff would coach and work out together at the hockey school.
Briestroff later died in 1996, as a passenger on TWA Flight 800.
“[Briestroff] was with us there. It's [one of] the only times I've been to Martha's Vineyard. And I think about my dear friend, Michel Briestroff … and what great memories we had in Martha's Vineyard,” Tracy said. “When I think of Martha's Vineyard, I think about Michel Briestroff. God rest his soul. That was for those summers.”
It wasn’t just the teammates that had made the experience memorable, however. For Tracy, the coaches and the staff would become lifelong influences as well. And it’s not hard to imagine, having trained under names like Bill Cleary ‘56 – a gold medalist for Team USA at the 1960 Winter Olympics and inductee to the US Hockey Hall of Fame.
“My senior year, I was living in Eliot. We’d lost a bunch of games in a row. We went on the road for the first round of ECACs, and we were playing St. Lawrence – I think they were the first seed. And we beat them – it was a best of three or whatever it was. And I got back and Bill Cleary, who was the athletic director at the time, but obviously, an iconic guy in Harvard history and hockey history – he called,” Tracy remembered. “He called our room, and he gave me a special call to talk about what guts we played with. And we'll never forget that. From Coach Cleary, I will just never forget that.”
Tracy attributes much of his success at Harvard to this support from the coaching staff, in both the highs and lows of college life. Tracy remembers especially the first half of his sophomore year, where he had struggled at the time with his stamina and lung capacity on the ice.
"Say we'd be killing a penalty. And, I mean, I just couldn't get over it," Tracy explained. "I'd thought I was just out of shape."
Thanks to antibiotics, Tracy made a recovery from what ended up being pneumonia, but it cost him a couple of days at the hospital. His release, luckily or unluckily, happened to coincide with the advent of another major event: the first round of the 1994 Beanpot, a heated Harvard vs. Boston University matchup that promised an unparalleled rivalry between two Final Four giants and BU vengeance for Harvard’s victory over the team last Beanpot. The incoming tournament demanded excellence from the Harvard team.
Yet, Tomassoni didn’t give Aaron Israel ‘96 – Harvard’s other star goaltender and also a Philadelphia Flyers prospect – the go-ahead. Despite the recent hospital visit and struggles on the ice, Tomassoni chose to start Tracy, the goaltender that had carried the team through the Beanpot the year before.
“We played so well that I think you could have thrown a Shooter Tutor in the net,” Tracy laughed. “He knew that I was sick, because you know, he's our coach – but I just was able to tell him how much it meant to me that he started me. I just told him that within the last couple of days, actually. Ronn – Coach Tomassoni – always believed in me.”
Harvard contained multitudes for Tracy. His time here has been invaluable for him, even over two decades later.
“What's my best way of summarizing what my Harvard experience meant to me?” Tracy reflected. “Talking about the Beanpot, talking about Coach Cleary calling my senior year – I got choked up, and that in a nutshell, right there. That's how much it meant to me.”
After graduating, Tracy turned his sights to his future in hockey. Though drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 1996, he was never signed by the Flyers past his status as a prospect. Instead, his old connections came in handy. Peter Karmanos, father of fellow Michigan and Harvard teammate Jason Karmanos, was the owner of the Hartford Whalers, now the Carolina Hurricanes. He gave Tracy a chance for a tryout with Jim Rutherford, the GM of the Whalers and later the Hurricanes when the franchise changed locations.
“I went in, I got a tryout, I earned a contract, I played well,” Tracy said.
Tracy would play a few years in the East Coast League and the American League. He was even called up for a few games in the NHL with the Hurricanes. In the first game that he had dressed as an NHL backup, the team had been facing the Dallas Stars. Tracy’s mother and father had been in the crowd, just as they had during each one of Tracy’s starts back at Harvard.
When Tracy’s two-year contract was up with the Whalers, he was offered another. Tracy turned it down.
“It didn’t really look like I was graduating – [that] I was moving up the depth chart [in] goal,” Tracy explained. “So I looked and I said, ‘Wow, I got called up to the NHL this year, I put on the jersey, now’s the time to move on.’”
Once again, it was his old relationships from Harvard that helped him break out. Ted Drury’s now-wife, Liz Drury, was a Harvard lacrosse player and semi-tutor to Tracy during his time at Harvard. Her father, Dan Berkery, was the General Manager of Boston’s WSBK-TV Channel 38. Through him, Tracy landed a job at CNN, as a production assistant.
“You’re learning, you’re making 15-16 bucks an hour,” Tracy said. “And I was just literally getting going in that job, and the color guy for the Hurricanes, who had ties to the Chicago Blackhawks – his name was Bill Gardiner – he left. Something happened, and the Hawks had an opportunity. He left right during training camp and the preseason in 1998, and so the Hurricanes needed to fill the role really quickly.”
Tracy had a little experience with broadcasting in the minors. He took a chance and applied. Peter Karmanos, owner of the Hurricanes, would give him that opportunity.
“That’s how it started, there’s nothing more to it than that,” Tracy said. “The owner believed in me, the General Manager believed in me – Jim Rutherford – and they decided to take a chance.”
Talk about a chance that paid more than its dividends. With more than 20 years with the Hurricanes under his belt, Tracy has blossomed into one of the most iconic voices in Raleigh, and in the NHL.
As the veteran in the broadcasting business now, Tracy finds himself as the one to reassure the rookies in the field – even the star players and former NHLers that he had once looked to on the athlete side.
“I remember Wayne Gretzky, when he started at TNT last year, he said, ‘Gosh Tripp, this television thing is hard!’ I’m like, ‘Wayne! You’re the Great One!’” Tracy laughed. “I saw Patrick Sharp in Chicago – I remember [Sharp] winning three cups, and being such a clutch performer for the Blackhawks. When he first started doing TV, he’d said ‘Gosh this is scary, I’m nervous.’ I’m like, ‘How can you be nervous, Sharpy?’”
Of course, as an analyst just starting out in the big leagues with little broadcasting experience, there was still a learning curve for Tracy. As with anything else worth doing, improving and excelling on the job required a lot of hard work and a lot of digging in. Alongside elite announcers such as John Forslund, Chuck Kane, and now Mike Maniscalo, Tracy gradually learned, grew, and took over the reins.
“It took me some time to build up the courage to start to build relationships with players, coaches, management, people around the league – there’s no substitute for experience,” Tracy recounted. “[And also to] start to rely on my own intuition as to how I see the game – be willing to take a chance, if you think something’s gonna happen and foreshadow.”
Now, beloved color commentator for the Carolina Hurricanes, host of the podcast ‘Digging in with Tripp’, and one of the brightest personalities in the league, Tracy has made a place for himself. His commentary and rinksides are the cornerstones of the game, Tracy is the Hurricanes’ modern-day Shakespeare. Hurricanes fans know intimately some of Tracy’s biggest catchphrases, which have weaved their way into the culture of the franchise itself – one of them sharing the same namesake as his podcast.
‘Digging in with Tripp’, Tripp’s personal hockey podcast, combines both the incredible energy of Tripp and the fascinating content brought in through his conversations with current and former players, or others involved with the sport.
“The reason I called it ‘Digging in’ is, when I was doing my bench interviews here in Carolina, oftentimes I’d walk into the dressing room,” Tracy explained. “Every team in the NHL has guys that probably have trouble getting to the interior, have some trouble doing what it takes to win. And so, if it was a guy I was about to interview that may be needed to be pushed, I would say to the coach, ‘Don’t worry, I’m gonna tell him to dig in’ at the end.”
As for the podcast, Tracy finds the endeavor enormously fun, and an incredible opportunity. From GMs and Hall of Famers to Stanley Cup winners and NHL rivals, Tracy has gotten an unbelievable list of names to “dig in” with him. More important than the names he interacts with, for Tracy, is the opportunity to grow his own skills.
“I love the challenge of an interview, of trying to ask good questions in as few words as possible,” Tracy said. “I remember when I first started doing interviews on live TV, I would have three or four questions, and whoever I was interviewing, they could have said, ‘Well, I’m going to Saturn tomorrow.’ And I wouldn’t even be able to hear it, because all I would care about is getting my next question in cleanly. And so the ability to listen, and to have some things in your head and spontaneously be able to react. And I think the way you get there is experience, doing it. So I love that part of ‘Digging in’, because I’d like to think it’s made me a better interviewer”
Though it took over two decades for Tripp Tracy to grow into the role that he has today, the journey for him has been more than worth it. An iconic figure in the Hurricanes’ fanbase, his loyalty to the organization has been paid back tenfold by the fans, the franchise, and the hockey community.
Tracy has felt this unconditional support, even during some of his most personally challenging moments. Last year in April, Tracy had briefly stepped back from his broadcaster position to address a personal matter. This came following two tweets from Tracy the night before, about having a drinking problem.
“I’m an alcoholic,” Tracy said. “And the reason I bring that up is that then when I finally was given the full acceptance of the disease that I have that I work on every day, the support of the hockey world – I can’t begin to try to quantify it in words. It’d be impossible to.”
Hundreds in the community had reached out, including Sidney Crosby, Wayne Gretzky, and Hurricanes head coach Rod Brind’Amour. The governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, had tweeted his support for the broadcaster as well. The support truly touched Tracy, who had recently spoken out about the experience following the incident this year.
“I never would have ever intended for it to be a public incident. But once I did that, I had to own it before I got to work on myself, and looking back on it, I’m actually grateful that it happened as it did,” Tracy said. “I don’t mind the fact that it’s public because we need to get more comfortable talking about alcoholism, addiction, and mental health.”
Though Tracy would be absent from the broadcasting booth for the rest of the 2021-22 season, he was greeted back by the franchise with a new broadcasting contract, and in turn, greeted back by the community as well.
“For me right now, as the Hurricanes are celebrating their 25th season in Carolina, and my 24th as a television analyst, I am just blown away by the support of the team that I work for, the hockey community, and so many other people that have supported me,” Tracy said. “That’s a massive part of my experience, and ultimately I have an opportunity to, by doing the right things that I can control, be of service to others.”
This is a philosophy that rings true for Harvard-bred Tracy – not just at the rink, but in all aspects of life.
“You have the greatest achievers on the planet at Harvard. Yes, you want to be personally successful in life,” Tracy said. “But ultimately, isn’t the very mission statement to work on yourself, so you can be of service to others, and be of service to mankind?”
For Tracy, just as his relationships have defined his Harvard experience, they have been just as monumental during Tracy’s broadcasting career, decades later.
These encompass not simply the admiration and support from the fans, but also that of the players, making Tracy’s role doubly unique within the league. Despite his role within the world of the media, Tracy’s heartfelt relationships with the team bring out a different, more personal type of interaction between the media and the player. Tracy’s Instagram and Twitter can be seen full of posts of Tracy golfing, chirping, and hanging out with players.
“Now I’m 48, and these fools keep me young – these players,” Tracy smiled. “We have a lot of fun.”
These friendships aren’t simply exclusive to the players on the team. Head coach for the Carolina Hurricanes, Rod Brind’Amour is a Stanley Cup champion, two-time Selke winner, and former captain of the Hurricanes. His talents extend to the coaching side as well – in his first season as a coach, he guided the team to their first Stanley Cup playoffs in a decade.
“It’s no secret if I got married tomorrow, Rod Brind’Amour would probably stand up at my wedding,” Tracy laughed. “But whether it be Rod or all these players, it’s a family atmosphere and you’re able to, in a very unique way, have these fabulous personal relationships but simultaneously … all know that we all have a professional job to do.”
On a more coincidental connection, Brind’Amour had also been recruited by Harvard. He went instead to Michigan State University, to play for the Spartans during their 1988-89 season, where the team had made the Final Four. Michigan State had been knocked out by Harvard, with a team composed of Lane MacDonald, and the rest of their national championship-winning crew – a fact that Tracy takes pleasure in reminding Brind’Amour about.
As for the Hurricanes, and Carolina in general – Tracy says that there is “no market” he’d “certainly rather be in.”
“As long as you work, unlike some other markets in the [NHL], they're gonna unconditionally support you,” Tracy explained. “And that is, of all the fabulous markets in the [NHL], that is what I find so uniquely special about Carolina.”
This is a sentiment shared by staff, media, and players alike. From Rod Brind’Amour, who’d spent almost half of his playing career in Philadelphia, only to make his home in Carolina – to newcomers Brent Burns and Jesper Fast “speaking to the ends of the Earth” about Carolina as “the loudest building they’ve ever been in.”
Now, 24 years into the game, Tracy has only continued to soar. Though some of the biggest questions in hockey have still yet to be solved, his time in the NHL’s spotlight continues to yield incredible fruits as the voice of some of the most electric moments in the league today.
As for aspiring broadcasters at Harvard, Tracy’s biggest advice is to “invest, totally”.
“Just like Rod Brind’Amour here, he is total, every day in whatever he’s doing. First and foremost with family, and then professional, personally [being] total,” Tracy explained. “So be total in whatever you chose to do.”
Another big part of staying afloat in the industry is the not-so-cliche: “Be yourself.” For Tracy’s former college team, he’s not disappointed. The 2022-23 Harvard men’s ice hockey team boasted the most NHL draft picks in the NCAA at 15.
“From the coach on down, they have all the tools and they have a lot of guys, that right now, [are] being total,” Tracy said. “It’s about extracting everything positive that they can from, in my view, the greatest college environment and opportunity that there is on planet Earth – but they have some guys that are gonna be very good NHLers, so I think they don’t need any advice from me.”
As both Harvard and the Hurricanes continue their dominating seasons, Tripp Tracy will be right at home in the booth, narrating along. Here’s to an end to another season of incredible calls, phenomenal fans, and of course, unbelievable hockey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team bounced back from a disappointing week of performances with a win against Colgate on Saturday, breaking its two-game losing streak. The team looked much more confident against the Raiders, building a decisive lead through the first three quarters of play. Despite winning the first faceoff, an area the team has been looking to improve throughout the season, the Raiders drew first blood.
Overall, the team appeared more cohesive than it did against Dartmouth. Similarly to the game against the Big Green, Harvard was able to stretch an early lead. The Crimson offense was more dominant, moving the ball with pace and precision, and the lines were able to pick apart the Colgate defense. Sophomore middies Miles Botkiss and Joe Dowling stood out as two players who were able to make a dynamic impact during the game. Botkiss tallied four goals and Dowling notched three goals and an assist. The two were particularly crucial in the team’s extra man conversions, each notching a goal alongside senior attackman Hayden Cheek on the man-up.
On the defensive end, the team looked solid for the first three quarters as it was able to hold the Raiders to just four goals for the entire forty-five minutes of play. However, lapses came in the last fifteen minutes of play as Harvard seemed to back off with its lead, getting caught ball-watching and sending the recovery slide a step too late. However, it was one of the tightest performances yet, and pairing its ability to shut down Colgate with the offense’s success in hitting the back of the net, was what pushed the team to victory.
“We had a heightened sense of urgency all week in practice which was led by our captain Nick and our seniors, with a focus on consistent play and playing a full game for four quarters,” Dowling commented. “A big emphasis this week will be working towards getting both our offense and defense clicking during the game next Saturday. We haven’t played a full sixty minutes of Harvard lacrosse yet, and that’s the goal.”
Heading into four games worth of Ivy play, the Crimson is set on the idea of stringing together four quarters of consistency. Despite clinching a victory, the team gave up six goals in the fourth quarter, more than the other three quarters combined.
“As a whole team, a big focus for us has been playing a full sixty minutes. Obviously that’s really hard to do, but we showed more glimpses of that against Colgate,” sophomore middie Andrew Perry reflected.
He stressed that, “We have struggled at times to put teams away when we have them on the ropes, which has been due to us making plays that allow them to feed off of and go on runs. Towards the end of the game we had to really buckle down as this started to happen, but it was good to put them away, and it’s a good thing to build off of as we get into a very tough stretch in our schedule.”
This critical, Ancient Eight stretch — consisting of Cornell, Penn, Princeton, and Yale — will make for both offensive and defensive challenges for the Crimson. All four of these teams have been dynamic throughout the season and are ranked in the top 20 according to Inside Lacrosse, besides Yale. In order to win against these higher caliber teams, Harvard must put together fast-paced offensive sets, wins on the faceoff, and lock-down defense in order to have a chance at clinching a slot in the Ivy Tournament.
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team will welcome No. 4 Cornell this Saturday, April 8 at 12:00 p.m. to Jordan Field. The game will also be streamed live on ESPN+.

It is no secret that ChatGPT has revolutionized college work (among other, I suppose, more important things). Just yesterday, I heard that someone “wrote their essay” in seven minutes. While I’m sure ChatGPT’s take on Hegel and Kant was illuminating, I figured its try at a Flyby article would be even more insightful (and funny).
I first imputed some of my previous Flyby articles until ChatGPT (my new friend?) seemed to have gotten the gist. According to ChatGPT a Flyby article “appears to be a type of student journalism piece that provides a lighthearted, personal take on a recent event or topic of interest to the college community. It often includes personal anecdotes, opinions, and observations, and may be written in a more informal, conversational style.” I couldn’t have said it better.
Next, I instructed it to try its hand at writing. It returned some fairly decent attempts: “Flyby Tries: Starting a New Hobby at Harvard” and “Flyby Tries: Joining a New Club”. I quickly realized I would have to be more specific, as these both were, no offense, extremely boring.
So, I asked ChatGPT to write the easy article, “Flyby Tries: The Pomodoro Method.” I also included some joke ideas. After a couple rounds of feedback, here’s the final product:
Flyby Tries (And Fails Miserably): The Pomodoro Method 
By: ChatGPT, A.I. Journalist and Comedian
As a seasoned procrastinator, I was excited to try out the Pomodoro Method, a study technique where you work for 25 minutes, take a five minute break, and then repeat the cycle. It sounded easy enough, and I was ready to enter my grind era. Boy, was I wrong.
On my first attempt, I lasted a whole three minutes before I got distracted by my phone. My friend had sent me a Hunger Games TikTok thirst trap. How could I focus on work when Peeta Mellark’s abs were right there in front of me?
But I didn’t give up just yet. I tried again, determined to make it work. For a while it did. I managed to work for a full 25 minutes without getting distracted. It was a miracle. But then the five minute break came around, and things went downhill from there.
Unfortunately, my five minute breaks turned into 10 minute breaks turned into 15 minute breaks, as my friends and I went down an endless gossip spiral about the romantic lives of our favorite college celebrities.
Somehow, my unproductivity was made even more unproductive. At least we were having fun. When I did buckle down and study, though, the Pomodoro Method was surprisingly effective. When I managed to focus for those precious 25 minutes, I actually got quite a bit of work done. It was a small victory, but a victory nonetheless.
If you’re going to give it a try, just make sure you have a good support system to keep you on track. And don’t forget to include some fun things during your breaks! Might I suggest listening to the song “Hair Up”? from Trolls (the movie). It’s a total bop that I would highly recommend all college DJs include in their sets.
So, who does it better, Flyby or ChatGPT, A.I. Journalist and Comedian?
