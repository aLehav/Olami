After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With his new film “The Favourite,” Yorgos Lanthimos of “The Lobster” fame brings to screen one of the most raunchy period pieces of recent cinema. This hilarious comedy, centering on Queen Anne of England, explores political ambition and loyalty through deliberate, stylistic shots and incredible acting. The film invokes “All About Eve,” but with more sexual intrigue and period flare.
The film opens in the early 18th century, with Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) as the sole monarch on the throne: England has long been at war with France and taxes are mounting in order to maintain failing military efforts, yet Anne’s court is nevertheless characterized by gross excess. Plagued with illness and mood swings, Anne relies on her old friend and secret lover — the Duchess of Marlborough, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) — to run the court. This close relationship allows Sarah to exert her personal will on national affairs. With the arrival of Sarah’s cousin Abigail (Emma Stone), trouble erupts across court. After her father loses his fortune, Abigail suffers a loss of her title and a multitude of tragedies which forces her to come to court as a maid. Yet under Sarah’s wing, she meets the Queen and her fortune changes drastically. Abigail’s burgeoning friendship with Anne begins to threaten Sarah’s political objectives, causing a jealous, tense triangle which the film spends the rest of its duration testing.
“The Favourite” is a psychological study. Its assessment of each character feels almost Austenian — if Jane Austen enjoyed lavish lobsters racing and heavy use of the c-word. Generally speaking, the script, written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, succeeds due to its quippy dialogue, largely filled with zingy one-liners. Most of these are delivered perfectly by Weisz’s character, whose overt vulgarity and candor make the film incredibly refreshing and at times almost contemporary. In one scene, she manages to convince the Queen to raise taxes to prolong the war in France, much to the anger of the dandy leader of the Tory party, Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult). Before Harley can continue his burst of anger, Sarah dismisses him instantly: “Your mascara is running. If you like, we can continue this later.” This is a world where women dictate and make up the rules, both in and out of the court, helping to differentiate this film from other political dramas of this time period.
With an exceptionally strong cast, “The Favourite” will surely sweep all major acting awards for its female leads. Colman certainly deserves one for magnificently capturing Queen Anne’s complexities. She is at once a petulant child and an unforgiving autocrat. Every expression that passes through Colman’s face is carefully constructed to show her character’s multifaceted personality and ever-changing moods.
Though her accent can at times sound a bit unnatural, it doesn’t reduce Emma Stone’s marvelous performance in this Machiavellian role. The monologues she delivers in front of her fiancé, Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn), are particularly funny. While Masham thinks he has found himself a competent wife, he soon discovers how much he has underestimated her ambition. Yet “The Favourite” does not play favorites. Each of the main women is treated sympathetically and given a wide range of motives and faults.
Even though the film is not entirely historically accurate — for example, Anne’s sexual relationships with the two other main characters is based on mere speculation — the plotlines appear plausible. Of course, an innate ridiculousness and absurdity colors the film, as typical of Lanthimos’ work. Sarah’s and Abigail’s sparring often occurs through the rather obvious vehicle of shooting practice scenes, where a win is never really about killing poultry. What differentiates these kind of scenes from others is that they put aristocratic women at the forefront, often engaged in masculine pastimes and roles. The film embraces modes of convention, yet subverts them stylistically.
Overall, the film treads a fine line between comedy and tragedy, offsetting darkness with irreverence. There are Anne’s 17 rabbits, which initially appear as yet another frivolous element of the court, but are revealed to represent all of her stillborn and dead children. This rather perverse detail helps to lend Anne a softness that expands her character. Another of these disturbing moments is when Robert Masham comes to Abigail’s room in the middle of the night to seduce her. She asks him: “Have you come to my room to seduce or rape me?” When he replies that he is a gentlemen, she quickly retorts: “So rape me, then.” This is offset later by Abigail’s more serious account of her numerous rapes. In the end, details like these expressing the harsh realities of the time period, particularly for women, illustrate the film’s depth and concern for an emotional truth, if not a historical one in this respect.
The soundtrack, consisting largely of plucked stringed staccatos as well as grand organ themes, does a fantastic job of pressing scenes forward. The dissonance of these sounds, though eerie, keeps the viewer on edge during the most terse scenes. In addition to this, the shots themselves are sweeping and often quite close to each character’s face, allowing for intimacy to develop, especially in the latter half of the film, when the plot becomes starkly darker.
Altogether, “The Favourite” is a riot and a splendid tableau of the precarious political atmosphere during Queen Anne’s reign. What really makes it worth seeing is its unapologetic humor and its female characters’ refusal to back down. Lanthimos and his three female leads have produced one of the most provocative and entertaining films of the year.

Though the Boston Ballet’s “The Nutcracker” runs annually in December, it did not fail to impress with its energy and high production value on its opening night on Nov. 29. Given its popularity, the dancing must be beautiful and focused. Its leads, principal dancers Misa Kuranaga (Sugar Plum Fairy) and Paulo Arrais (The Nutcracker), were delightful, as was newcomer Mia Steedle (Clara). Though “The Nutcracker” is considered a children’s ballet both for its accessibility and young cast, it continues to stand the test of time by bringing holiday spirit and imagination to an often serious art.
Adapted from E. T. A. Hoffmann's story "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King,” this ballet was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov: It first premiered at the Mariinsky Theater in 1892, set to the score of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Op.71.” In the hands of choreographer and artistic director Mikko Nissinen, “The Nutcracker” does not receive radical revisions. This is at its heart an incredibly classical show, without much experimentation. Instead the choreography is characterized by traditional canons, leaps, and a heavy amount of jumps.
As the Sugar Plum Fairy, Kuranaga was a delight. Kuranaga moved with a grace and ease, as if dancing on air. Her pirouettes melted into each other, quickly transitioning into perfect fouettés during many of her dances. She managed to make each of her movements swell with life as if to dance were to breathe. She also brought a sprightliness and etherealness that were not amiss in a role that builds up dynamically over the course of the performances.
Arrais was just as exciting in his role, but in a different way. He conveyed a stateliness across the stage that was worlds away from Kuranaga’s petite, almost coy movements. The difference in their dancing styles highlighted each other’s strengths, particularly during the “Grand Pas de Deux,” which is based on the original choreography of Lev Ivanov. Both delighted with their exactitude and incredible stage presence, though much like in Petipa’s version, the female dancer is the focus — with Kuranaga the obvious star.
Steedle was equally wonderful in her role, imbuing Clara with unbridled grace. She danced on pointe nearly the whole time. Many other interpretations like to have her dance in soft shoes to make a marked contrast in dancing between Clara and the other ballerinas of the show. Yet, this decision to have her on pointe was exceedingly successful as it allowed Steedle to showcase her rather delightful technical abilities.
The music was beautifully performed under new music director Mischa Santora, who joined Boston Ballet earlier his year. The orchestra began its overture with spirit. As this is a traditional performance, no dancers were present on stage initially. This allowed the audience to concentrate on the clear and rich tones of the players. They kept up the energy throughout the performance and seemed almost to reinvent certain beloved classics from the score. “The Dance of the Reed Pipes” was particularly measured and light, due to its strong flute section.
At times, the orchestra did seem to lose speed, such as in the “Arabian Dance.” It could have used more pull and lull, especially as it did do not justice to the dancing of Kathleen Breen Combes, who really stunned with her almost acrobatic performance.
As usual, the costumes, made up of countless bejeweled tulle tutus, satin gowns and impeccably tailored military coats, astounded — courtesy of Robert Perdziola. Special effect choices like the snow fall during Dew Drop’s dance or the fog that appears at the feet of the dancers in the Nutcracker Prince’s kingdom were continued according to tradition. These elements continued to delight, by bringing whimsy and emphasizing liminality.
Despite countless seasons of performing “The Nutcracker,” the Boston Ballet does not lose sight of its creativity. It manages to strike a balance between reinvention and tradition, largely due to its incredibly dynamic dancers, who breathe new life into their roles. Though familiar, the costumes and lavish set continued to impress, once again triumphing with this cherished, city-wide tradition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is arguing that plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit opposing the College’s social group sanctions are “premature” in requesting an order to protect anonymous undergraduates’ identities from public disclosure, the University’s attorneys wrote in a court filing Monday.
“There is no exigency that justifies rushing this request to the Court,” the document reads. “Harvard requests that the Plaintiffs’ motion for a protective order be denied.”
Three unidentified College students — members of all-male social clubs at Harvard — are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with the Harvard chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and the parent organizations of two sororities and two fraternities. They allege the University's sanctions on social groups are unconstitutional and discriminatory on the basis of sex. The penalties bar members of single-gender social organizations from selection to varsity athletic captaincies, campus leadership positions, and College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
The plaintiffs’ Dec. 3 complaint includes a request that the students, called “the John Doe Plaintiffs” in court documents, remain unnamed out of concern about “the very reputational and professional harm that this lawsuit seeks to remedy.”
The plaintiffs moved to use pseudonyms to refer to the students and asked the judge for a protective order mandating the redaction of personally identifying information in filings.
“John Doe 1, John Doe 2, and John Doe 3 fear they will suffer harassment and threats for bringing this lawsuit,” the attorneys wrote. “They also fear retribution from Defendants for bringing the lawsuit.”
Harvard’s lawyers disputed the relevance of a protective order on the grounds that they have neither received a request to confer with the plaintiffs — a legal requirement for such an order — nor sought information about the students’ identities, according to the Monday filing. But they did not object to anonymity for the students, though they wrote that they might do so in future filings.
Harvard wrote in the Monday filing that it intends to file a “rule 12 motion,” which legal experts say would argue that even if the plaintiffs’ factual allegations are completely true, they do not show that the sanctions are discriminatory under the law. If Chief Judge Patti B. Saris ’73 of the United States District Court in Boston — the federal judge assigned to the case — agrees with this motion, she will dismiss the case and protecting the students' identities will be a moot point. Saris is a former member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body, and was Associate Managing Editor of The Crimson.
CUNY law professor Merrick T. Rossein said he thinks the court will likely deny the plaintiffs’ request for a protective order, noting that a “strong presumption” in favor of public disclosure raises a high bar for plaintiffs seeking anonymity.
“Anonymous lawsuits are the rare exception,” Rossein said. “There’s a strong public interest in disclosure, that the citizenry should understand what’s going on in the courts and the people have a right to know what’s going on.”
Some legal experts said they thought the request for anonymity should also not succeed.
Attorney Douglas E. Fierberg, whose legal practice specializes in school violence and fraternity-related assault, said he sees “no circumstance” where these motions should be granted.
“The plaintiffs’ request to proceed by pseudonym and pursue a protective order protecting their identity is, to me, unwarranted by law,” Fierberg said. “That’s just not going to happen.”
Even if the plaintiffs’ request for a protective order does not succeed, Harvard’s decision not to object to pseudonyms now may “allay the concerns of the plaintiffs,” according to attorney Sean P. Callan, whose firm advises fraternities and sororities.
When Saris ultimately decides whether to grant the undergraduates anonymity, her ruling could affect their involvement in the suit. In court declarations filed by the anonymous students, each one stated “I will not go forward with the lawsuit” if “it is determined that my identity must be disclosed in order to participate.”
Andrew Tutt, a lawyer at the D.C.-based firm Arnold & Porter who represents the plaintiffs, wrote in an email that the motion is “ripe for resolution” and that it would “not be surprising” for the judge to rule within the next few weeks.
Harvard has retained the services of international legal firm Goodwin Procter LLP to defend it in federal court. Its legal team includes former federal prosecutor Roberto M. Braceras and William M. Jay, an assistant to the Solicitor General with extensive experience arguing before the Supreme Court. Legal experts say the defense is likely to be a lengthy fight that will cost the University millions of dollars.
Harvard’s sanctions policy, which debuted in 2016 and first applied to the Class of 2021, was the outcome of a years-long committee review and a formal vote of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Final clubs in Harvard Square — which have actively lobbied against the policies — are not yet formally involved in the litigation.
Harvard has until Feb. 4 to respond to the plaintiffs’ complaint in federal court. The University also faces another discrimination suit in Massachusetts state court; it must respond to that complaint by Feb. 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. denied all allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him in a letter published in the New York Times Thursday.
Fryer is currently the subject of at least four Harvard-led investigations and one state-level investigation into alleged sexual and financial misconduct. At Harvard, the Office for Dispute Resolution — the University group that investigates formal complaints of sexual and gender-based harassment — opened three inquiries into sexual misconduct allegations against Fryer. Harvard is also looking into Fryer’s spending at EdLabs, the research group he founded, according to the Times.
Separately, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination is investigating him based on allegations of sexual harassment brought by one of the Harvard complainants.
Fryer wrote in his letter that EdLabs “has always been a collegial and at times irreverent place.” He added that the Times’s sources inaccurately described his behavior.
“I never retaliated against any employee; I never wrote a negative recommendation letter for anyone; I never refused to write a letter of recommendation for any lab researcher; I never bullied anyone; no Harvard official has ever expressed concern to me over my conduct; and I never made sexual advances to any employee,” Fryer wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on whether Harvard officials ever contacted Fryer about his behavior before this year.
Fryer also wrote that EdLabs employees “have on occasion made off-color jokes and commented on one another’s lives outside of work, including their dating lives.”
“As the faculty director of the lab, I allowed, encouraged and participated in this atmosphere. In that, I was wrong,” he wrote.
The letter is not the first time Fryer has denied allegations of misconduct. In a May interview — shortly before The Crimson first reported the existence of at least two investigations into his behavior — Fryer said he had “zero recollection” of commenting on employees’ sex lives publicly in EdLabs, one of several allegations he denied at the time.
In the letter and in the May interview, Fryer wrote that the success of women who worked in EdLabs is evidence that his lab is not a hostile environment for female employees.
“Every female research assistant has been admitted into at least one top 10 graduate program upon completion of her research fellowship at EdLabs,” he wrote. “Furthermore, the majority of lab employees and the vast majority of its managers are women.”
When the allegations against Fryer first surfaced, Rucha P. Vankudre ’07 — who currently serves as a project manager at EdLabs — also pointed to Fryer’s mentorship of female employees.
“I think if you’re sexist, you don’t choose women to run your lab,” she said in a May interview.
Though ODR has issued a report on at least one of its inquires into Fryer, he is still the subject of at least one Harvard investigation in addition to the MCAD probe. Because Fryer is a faculty member, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay will receive ODR’s final reports. She is not expected to make a decision about what — if any — punishment he recieves until officials have closed all of their investigations, the Times reported earlier this month.
Gay can choose to take any action ranging from “verbal warning up to and including termination,” per FAS policies. Only the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — can vote to revoke a professor’s tenure.
