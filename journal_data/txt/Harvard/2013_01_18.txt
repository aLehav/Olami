My family loves to travel and observe nature, but we do not necessarily yearn to interact with the great outdoors. For example, we will all gather to watch a majestic summer thunderstorm, but we do it comfortably under a sturdy roof and behind window screens.
Exploring Machu Picchu, a 15th century Inca site, with my family this January was therefore invariably a delight—although even before we landed, I knew that my parents were unprepared for Mother Nature's warm and insect-filled embrace.
I learned quickly that Peru was also wet. As soon as we landed at the Aguas Calientes rail station, a steady downpour began with no intention of relenting for the weak-hearted.
The second a raindrop touched the ground, umbrellas and raincoats popped up outside of the stores as if they were the understudy who finally got the chance to perform because the main actor called in sick.
Once at the park entrance, we had one final test to retrace the path of Hiram Bingham, the Yale professor who stumbled upon Machu Picchu a little over a hundred years ago. We were going to hike up the mountain (a more historically accurate test would have required that we take artifacts and not return them until much later—not so lux or veritas after all, Hiram).
My family’s average physical aptitude and the high altitude resulted in a deceptively demanding climb. My mother, the clever and considerate woman that she is, allegedly only pretended to be completely out of breath in order to slow down my father, but the jury is still out. My sister and I would systematically check that a black orb was still behind us, as my father's windblown black poncho made him look like the Phantom of the Opera.
When we finally reached Machu Picchu, the planes, trains, and automobiles were worth it. A never-ending line of vibrantly green peaks with a gushing river at their bases surrounded our insignificant bodies. Climbing over the stones strolled upon by my Inca counterparts 600 years ago, I truly was on an adventure.
I was reminded of the C.S. Lewis quote: "Don't use words too big for the subject. Don't say 'infinitely' when you mean 'very;' otherwise you'll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite." With this moment as one of those scarce occasions in life when the word "infinite" seemed appropriate, I crossed the threshold of time into a pre-Columbian world.
At each corner of the restored city, one word—how—prevailed on everyone’s lips. How did the Inca build a city in such a hidden place within the Andes? How is it possible to accurately predict the winter solstice by measuring the shade projections on the central rock from the east window in the Sun Temple? How did they split these massive stones to create such solid structures that have survived every earthquake? How did they fill up two circular receptacles with water in order to serve as "mirrors" for astral observations during clear nights? How did they construct a communication system using an understanding of sound wave travel in water to contact another compound 100 meters away? How did archeologists find tubes of rubber with small remnants of blood, an indication of a blood transfusion, in the "hospital" area?
Our tour guide Fred related the theories about the Inca, emphasizing that they were a technologically advanced people who adapted to their environment and whose religious focus caused them to track celestial patterns.
But I have a better, more rational theory: What if the Inca were helped by aliens? It would explain their remarkable understanding of astronomy, their impressive city, and their mysterious disappearance supposedly due to an epidemic and the arrival of the Spanish.
While I attempt to gather more proof for my speculation, one thing is clear: Nothing is too extraordinary or impossible at the top of Machu Picchu—not even theories of alien assistance.

I drove by my old house once. That was a luxury I felt I could allow myself. I rolled past the driveway in my beat up Suburban and peered in. The house appeared to be basically the same, but it seemed as if my family had already been forgotten. I didn’t linger—I knew the new, sole tenant would not like to see me staring—I pressed the pedal and roared on my way.
As we unloaded our cars into the Marriott Hotel that would be our home for the interim, I asked my parents if we could have waited to move until after I was done with break. I knew the answer was going to be a definitive “no,” but I felt justified in asking. I wasn’t exactly looking forward to living out of a hotel for my few weeks away from school. My mom surveyed our temporary home, “Well, at least after a month in here the new house will feel huge,”  she concluded as the rest of us piled our belongings on the sidewalk.  
The place was certainly small, and I had to share a bed with my sister. Though it wasn’t all bad. The hotel allowed pets, so I made a game of running our golden retriever up and down the halls. Our cat, meanwhile, got lost when the maids came in to vacuum and make my bed. We found her two days later, yowling in an empty hotel room. There was a Jacuzzi which we raved about all the time, but only used once. Tea was served in the front lobby. I enthusiastically related all this to my friends who would invariably ask about the really important changes: “So, no New Year’s Party?” 
The hotel put together themed social events for us during weeknights. Monday is Nacho Night, Tuesday is BBQ, and so on. We got along with the employees, who all knew us by name (or at least said “you” in a more meaningful way than usual), but had no desire to meet any of the other tenants. Once, my parents and I sidled into BBQ night, grabbed a few plates of hamburgers and potato salad and attempted to sneak back to the room with minimum social interaction. Erin, the girl who ran the front desk, smirked as we snuck by, and said to me, “What, you’re still here?” 
“Yep, I’m around for another week,” I replied, before turning up the hallway. We became stable faces in a place where most people come and go freely, locals within a community of visitors.  
One day, my parents brought my siblings and me to the new house with a few beers and some cheese and crackers to get a first impression of the place. We wandered across the threshold into a gutted, stark interior. We set the food in the middle of the room and sat on the floor, munching. Mom gushed about her plans for the house: the walls they’d tear down, the paints they’d try, the rooms they’d create. “It’s definitely a project,” she admitted. It definitely wasn’t home to me, yet. 
As the rest of my family occupied themselves with beer and brie, I wandered around my future home and started buying into the vision. It might not be home yet, but it sure beat the Marriott. I rejoined the others in what will be our new family room, and toasted to a new beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three experienced mediators will take part in contract negotiations between Harvard and its clerical and technical workers beginning this week, according to a joint statement released by the two sides Thursday.
The mediators—Lawrence F. Katz, an economics professor at Harvard; Robert B. McKersie, a professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management; and Arnold M. Zack, a prominent arbitrator who has helped several U.S. presidents resolve labor disputes in the public sector—will attempt to help the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers reach an agreement that has eluded them since talks began in April of last year.
Contract negotiations have been far from straightforward, grappling with contentious topics including health care plans, salary increases, and, by extension, the financial health of the University.
“While there has been a great deal of honest exchange, and some progress has been made, both sides have expressed the hope that mediation will help the parties constructively address differences over the salary increase program and health care issues,” read the statement.
The contract that currently governs the relationship between Harvard and HUCTW was originally set to expire on June 30, 2012 but has remained in effect due to a failure to ratify a new agreement by the July 1 deadline. HUCTW members include thousands of Harvard’s librarians, secretaries, lab technicians, and other non-faculty staff.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said he thinks the introduction of Katz, McKersie, and Zack into the negotiations is an encouraging development.
“This is an impressive group of mediators, deeply trusted on both sides," Jaeger said. "So it’s a positive step.”
HUCTW and Harvard have used arbitrators to help negotiate previous contracts throughout the union’s 25-year history. In the current talks, negotiators began using a mediator late last summer, at which time both sides expressed optimism that the introduction of a third party would be helpful.
Following Thursday’s announcement, both Jaeger and a Harvard spokesperson declined to comment publicly on what progress has been made since those discussions and what exactly they hoped the new mediators might accomplish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team is already walking in Memphis, but the major challenge now facing it is walking out of the city with a win.
Saturday’s contest against the Tigers at the FedEx Forum will mark the final non-conference tuneup for the Crimson (9-5), which began league play last week with a 75-65 road victory over Dartmouth.
In that game, Harvard had to stave off a Big Green squad gunning for a major upset. On Saturday, it will be the Crimson that will be the heavy underdog against a Memphis team that began the year ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 poll and No. 16 in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches’ poll and has gone 13-3 since.
The Tigers’ lone losses this year have come versus Louisville (currently ranked No. 1 in the country), Minnesota (currently ranked No. 9), and Virginia Commonwealth (currently ranked No. 22), so going into Memphis and pulling out a win over one of the nation’s best mid-majors—winners of seven straight—will be an extremely tough task.
“Memphis is incredibly talented,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “This is a team that can score a lot in bunches, they can get up and down the floor, [and] they’re very athletic.”
Despite the Tigers’ athleticism, Memphis is not the tallest of teams. Like Harvard, it starts three guards in Joe Jackson, D.J. Stephens, and Geron Johnson.
Jackson, the Tigers’ leading scorer at 13.9 points per game, will most likely be defended by Crimson sophomore wing Wesley Saunders, as Amaker has often tasked his leading scorer with defending the opponent’s best perimeter player this season.
Inside, 6’9” freshman center Shaq Goodwin will pose an especially tough matchup for 6’6” Crimson sophomore Jonah Travis.
One of the top recruits in the nation last season, Goodwin is averaging 9.1 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. His presence inside could lead to more minutes for 6’8” sophomore Kenyatta Smith and 6’7” classmate Steve-Moundou Missi, who registered his best game of the season by scoring 15 points in 24 minutes off the bench against the Big Green.
The Crimson bigs may seek to slow Goodwin by sending him to the line—where he is shooting just 64 percent—but more important to their interior success will be the ability to rebound.
“They’re a big team, far bigger than us, so we have to really focus on boxing out,” freshman point guard Siyani Chambers said.
“They’re very tough on the backboard,” Amaker added. “One of the Achilles heels for our team has been people being able to get on the glass and get second chance opportunities...[so] we’ve got to make sure we do a really good job there.”
Like Goodwin, Chambers has put together an impressive freshman campaign of his own. After scoring a career-high 22 points against the Big Green, the point guard won his fourth Ivy Rookie of the Week honor, joining Saunders—who won his third Conference Player of the Week award—on the league’s honor roll.
Saunders leads the conference with 16.4 points per game, while Chambers is seventh in the league at 13.3 points and junior co-captain Laurent Rivard is 10th with 11.4.
But Amaker says if his team is going to emerge from Memphis victorious, more important than its ability to score will be its ball protection.
“We’ve got to do a better job of taking care of the basketball,” Amaker said. “We’ve at times had games where we’ve had way too many turnovers. We’re going to have some because we play fast and we want to get up and down...but we’ve got to eliminate the silly stuff.”
That will be especially true at the FedEx Forum, where the Tigers ranked 11th in the country with an average of 16,000-plus fans per game last season.
“Memphis basketball is very important to that community [and] they support that program very well,” Amaker said. “We can’t just have poor offensive possessions [that] allow them to transition the ball up the floor and do some things that are very exciting for their home crowd [in] a very tough place to play.”
In Harvard’s two near misses at road upsets this season—a 67-64 loss at UMass and a 70-69 loss at St. Mary’s—crucial turnovers in the final seconds by Saunders and Rivard, respectively, helped cost the Crimson a pair of wins.
But Amaker says his team’s performances in those types of hostile environments show it can handle the pressures of the road.
“We can look back on some teams we’ve played, whether it’s a Cal-Berkley, UMass, [or] UConn [that have] similar kinds of players with great athletic ability, and draw from those experiences,” Amaker said. “Some of the places that we’ve already been in will allow us, at some comfort level, to adjust to that sort of environment.”
Despite the imposing presence of the arena and its home team, the coach said that he just wants his team to play the same way it has all year.
“We may not be able to pressure them as much [as we do other teams],” Amaker said. “We may just try to pull it back and contain them a little bit, but for the most part we’re going to be who we’ve been and see [if] we can take this challenge head-on.”

Although the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had not competed since late November, the squad did not appear to show any rust when it returned to action on Thursday.
Racing against Brown (3-3, 0-3 Ivy) in Providence, R.I., the Crimson (4-0, 4-0) opened up an early lead and did not look back en route to a 206-90 victory over the Bears.
Each of five Harvard swimmers earned two individual first-place finishes, and the Crimson failed to earn the top spot in only two of the 16 events. The team effort improved Harvard’s all-time record against Brown to 80-2.
“I think we went into the meet with the right mentality,” freshman Christian Carbone said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be an extremely difficult meet, but despite that everybody was fired up to race and give 100 percent…. We actually did med balls in the morning, and we lifted the afternoon before, so everybody was a little tired. But we gave it a good effort, and I think everybody was pretty pleased.”
In the diving portion of the meet, sophomore Mike Mosca dominated each of his two events, besting the school records he set last year in both.
Mosca first took to the board in the 1-meter, where he posted a score of 372.45 to lay down a new high mark.
But the sophomore was not done yet. Just a few minutes later, he set his second record of the night on the 3-meter board. The mark of 412.42 shattered the previous high by more than 17 points.
“I’m obviously excited that I dove that well,” Mosca said. “If there’s any pool I want to dive well at, it’s the Brown pool because that’s where [Ivy League Championships] is going to be.”
No other diver came close to Mosca, and he went on to win the two events by 74 and 85 points, respectively.
“I thought [Mosca’s] performance was absolutely awesome,” Carbone said. “It’s just amazing what those guys do, with the mental preparation that goes into it. I know that they weren’t very rested for this meet either…. To be able to perform like this a week after very intensive training bodes excellently for the rest of the season.”
Sophomore Chuck Katis contributed another solid performance for the Crimson. Katis took first in the 100-yard backstroke and the 200 IM, the latter of which he won by just under four seconds.
Katis also helped Harvard to victory in the final event of the night, the 200 medley relay. Although the top Crimson lineup found itself trailing after the first leg, the squad clawed its way back to record its best time of the season and end the night on a high note.
Junior Oliver Lee, sophomore Michael Gaudiani, and Carbone were the three other Harvard swimmers who achieved two first-place finishes in individual events.
Like Katis, Lee propelled himself to a total of three top-spot finishes on the day. The sprinter took first in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle races, and he swam the third leg for the victorious 200 IM squad.
Gaudiani shouldered some of the longer swims for the Crimson. He edged out the Bears’ Cory Mayfield by just over half a second in the 500 free, and closed out his night with a victory in the stroke’s 1000-yard event.
Carbone, for his part, also took home first place in both the 200 breaststroke and the fly at the same distance. Freshman Christian Yeager cleaned up in the 200 back for his third win in the event this season.
“I think we’re in a really good place, especially considering the consistency we’ve had,” Carbone said.
The win was Harvard’s largest margin of victory this season. The squad placed at least two competitors in the top three spots in all but two events.
The Crimson will return to the Brown pool for the Ivy League Championships, a three-day event beginning on March 7. The team attempted to replicate the structure of that meet against the Bears by working out before the races and waking up early the next morning to get in another tough swim.
“There was a lot of energy going in because we wanted to make it feel just like Ivy’s, so we prepared ourselves to compete as if it’s the end of the season,” Mosca said. “I thought it was a good experience, and it was fun to do that with the team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Vatican has invited Jeremy Lin ’10 to join a holy tag-team to take down Lance Armstrong.
The Catholic News Service (CNS) reported Wednesday that the Pontifical Council of Culture hopes to host an international conference with prominent Christian athletic leaders to promote sporting values. Lin and NFL quarterback Tim Tebow are among the Vatican's invitees.
The announcement came a day before seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong's cheating admissions aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Monsignor Melchor Sanchez de Toca Alameda, head of the Council's "Culture and Sport" section, described Armstrong's confession as "just the tip of the iceberg" to the CNS. Monsignor Sanchez de Toca said that the council plans to address the pressures of doping and commoditization within professional athletics.
According to the CNS, the Vatican City conference would take place sometime this spring. While Tebow would likely have few football-based commitments during that time frame, Lin could be in the middle of a playoff push.
But if the Houston Rockets, who currently sit eighth in the Western Conference, continue to have trouble collecting wins, Lin should have some free time on his hands come post-season.  If Lin does attend the ecumenical conference, he would be expected "to give witness to how the worlds of faith and sports can easily come together," according to the CNS.
After a month on Twitter, His Holiness may have learned one thing: a little bit of Linsanity and Tebowmania can go a long way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its fifteenth straight win at the Bright Hockey Center, the Harvard women’s hockey team (15-1-1, 12-0-0 ECAC) rolled over the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Engineers (6-15-2, 4-7-0 ECAC), 4-1, to stay undefeated in conference play.
Both teams started quickly, scoring three goals within a four-minute span in the opening period. The Crimson led, 2-1, after the first but found itself tied in shots on goal, 10 to 10, and unable to convert its only power play opportunity before heading into the first intermission.
In the next two periods, Harvard out-shot RPI, 23-5, and surrendered no goals on two power play opportunities. The Crimson took advantage of a five-on-three power play of its own to add its fourth goal of the evening early in the third period. The score took place on a redirection shot by junior Lyndsey Fry, placing the puck in the top left corner of the net for her second goal of the evening.
“I think that we were ready to go coming in,” coach Katey Stone said. “However, I think that we worked a little bit harder in the second and third period. We came up with a few more one-on-one pucks and didn’t turn the puck over as much. I think it was a greater sense of urgency and more communication. These games are all pretty tough and we have to get in the habit of playing in some real dogfights.”
Fry agreed with her coach, stating that the early goal by RPI—a power play goal by Engineer junior Taylor Horton—got the team re-focused. Two minutes after the Horton score, Fry knocked an RPI pass into the boards and skated past two Engineer defenders before slapping the puck past the outstretched arm of the goalie. The goal gave Harvard an advantage that it never relinquished.
“You get a little slap in the face there when they score a goal,” Fry said. “You remember that they are coming to play. The biggest thing that we have to keep in mind when we play is that the success we’ve been having means that every team that comes in here has their Stanley Cup game.”
Sophomore Crimson defender Michelle Picard sparked the inception of the night’s offense when she intercepted a pass deep in RPI territory, starting a breakaway before flicking a wrist shot into the top left corner of the goal to give Harvard its initial advantage. Picard had a team high plus-minus of +2 on the day and her three shots on goal were tied for third on the team.
Senior Jillian Dempsey, the team’s leading shot-taker, managed six shots on goal but had her thirty-game point streak snapped. The streak, which dated back to last season, was the longest in the nation.
Friday’s contest marked the Crimson’s sixth win and thirteenth unbeaten contest in a row. The match-up was the fourth in a five-game homestand that culminates on Saturday against Union. Stone said that with nearly half the regular season—12 of 29 games—to go, the team still has a lot to work on.
“We’re trying improve in every facet of the game and not just one or two,” Stone explained. “We’ve been doing well grinding it out, playing tough, and being physical. We’ll do whatever we need to [in order] to get the win.”
The victory was the team’s second this season against the Engineers, having defeated them, 2-1, on the road earlier this month. In every game, Fry said, whether at home or on the road, it is key to approach the opponents in a similar fashion and focus on what the team can control—its own play.
“Last time we played them we weren’t playing our game,” Fry said. “The biggest thing was coming out and focusing on us and what we were doing instead of what they were doing. Obviously we watched film and prepared for what they were going to bring at us but the biggest difference between last game and this game is making sure we focus on what we were going to do. We did the little things well today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the exact midway point of the NBA regular season, Jeremy Lin ’10’s Houston Rockets find themselves at a crossroads. By losing its sixth straight game Friday night in a 105-95 loss to the Indiana Pacers, Houston fell out of playoff standings. It currently sits a single hundredth of a percentage point behind the Portland Trail Blazers for the eight seed in the Western Conference.
Friday’s matchup was a tale of cat and mouse, the Rockets continually just short of making a competitive run against Indiana, always a few possessions out of real contention. Houston’s starting lineup combined for 15 turnovers, while the entire Pacers team recorded only 13 mistakes.
On the night, Lin tallied 10 points on four-for-seven shooting, including knocking down both of the shots that he took from beyond the arc. The Harvard alum also notched five rebounds and three assists.While Lin shot efficiently, several of his teammates struggled from the field, and the squad shot just 41 percent for the contest.
“We were never able to build a lot of momentum at any point in the game,” Lin explained following the game. “When we get down that much at some point in time everything has to go your way for you to be able to get back in the game. We can’t keep putting ourselves in a position where we have to play a near-perfect game. It’s not one thing that we have to fix, we just have to go back to the basics, play better defense and do a better job rebounding.”
It was Paul George for Indiana who truly torched Houston, putting up 31 points behind a 7-of-10 shooting performance from downtown. The third-year player also nabbed five steals, 3.6 more than his career average. Additionally, George had the assignment of covering James Harden, a player who has averaged over 26 points per game this season. On Friday night though, Harden was kept to 17 points on 26 percent shooting.
Lin and the Rockets will have little rest before starting the second half of their regular season Saturday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves. While its star player Kevin Love will be out due to injury, Minnesota enters Saturday’s contest only two and a half games back of Houston for the ninth spot in the West.

January 15, 1892: Harvard-Yale Debate.
The Harvard-Yale debate, on the subject "That a young man casting his first ballot in 1892 should vote for the nominees of the Democratic party," was held last night in Sanders theatre, before a very large and appreciative audience. Governor William E. Russell presided and introduced the speakers in turn. Each speaker spoke for fifteen minutes.
The debate was opened by R. D. Upton of Yale, who spoke on "The party of progress and modern ideas." Many things have been urged against the Democratic party, but it is essentially a party of reform, nominating Grover Cleveland, who become the head and consolidated that party, and won for it a glorious record. The Republican party, while it possessed great sentiments had also great unity, but when it lost them, it became broken. While the Republican party has became a party of selfish expedients, the Democratic party protects individual freedom. The Democratic party of today is a champion of peace, purity and reform. It stands for freedom and progression—a party which is, and not one which has been.
January 15, 1920: "Getting" The Harvard Radicals
The demand for the removal from office of Immigration Inspector Henry J. Skeffington is but a natural result of a steadily growing intolerable state of affairs. The government officials, the country at large, and the press seem possessed with a fear of a "red revolution," an impossible and entirely remote contingency in this country. Anything liberal, or to the slightest degree unconventional in political and industrial theory, is being branded as revolutionary. Doubtless in times of over-fast development there are very real dangers incurred by the idle patter of "parlor bolshevists." But in times of reaction from liberalism such as the present there are still greater dangers in applying the epithet "parlor bolshevist" to anyone who dares assert an independent opinion. If this nation and the whole world do not watch their step carefully, the next decade will usher in a period of suppression on such a scale that in comparison the age of Metternich will appear as a mad whirl of anarchy.
It is of moment that Mr. Skeffington claims he did not speak of the Liberal Club in particular, but that he merely said he would "like to get some of these Harvard radicals." The fact remains that he represents a point of view which cannot be allowed to prevail in the administration of our government unless we desire the rule of an intolerant aristocracy representing the ideas of only one class.
January 13, 1938: Harvard Vagabonds To Have Access to Radcliffe Soon
For the first time in history, Harvard men will be permitted to attend a class at Radcliffe, namely one of two new music courses beginning there after midyears.
Engaged last spring as visiting lecturer in music, Nadia Boulanger, French musician, will give two new courses, one of which, a graduate seminar in music competition, will be open to students from the brother institution, it was learned yesterday.
January 14, 1955: Lecturer 'Imperils Court,' Judge Says
Dr. Leona Baumgartner, a University Lecturer who doubles as a New York City Health Commissioner, was accused Tuesday by a Brooklyn magistrate of "helping to wreck the whole judicial system."
A Visiting Lecturer in Maternal and Child Health, Dr. Baumgartner had publicly criticized a $50 fine, levied on a careless landlord by Magistrate Milton Solomon. As a result, she was summoned to court to face a possible contempt charge. The landlord concerned was fined when a faulty gas heater he owned caused the death of a tenant. Dr. Baumgartner, terming the fine "wholly inadequate," was advised by magistrate Solomon to "apply herself to her own duties.
January 17, 1966: Harvard Scientists Attack Use of Chemical Weapons
Nineteen members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Medical School faculty as well as ten other scientists from the Boston area have sent a statement to a number of high Administration officials condemning American use of chemical warfare in Vietnam.
The 29 scientists contended that since the use of chemical and biological weapons is directed against a country's civilian population "it does not serve our national interest, and is immoral." They defined chemical weapons as those toxic to men, animals, and plants.
Copies of the petition were sent to Vice President Humphrey, Secretary of State Rusk, and Secretary of Defense MacNamara.
They discounted U. S. attempts to justify the use of gas and herbicides in Vietnam on the grounds that they are not lethal.

While the film industry is gearing up for the announcement of the winners of the 85th annual Academy Awards next month, Harvard professors are showcasing short films of their own as shopping week fast approaches.
Administrators in the General Education program began encouraging professors to make videos advertising their Ged Ed classes following the creation of a popular course trailer in 2008. And since then, the trend has caught on. This semester, 11 videos publicizing courses ranging from Culture and Belief 43: "The World of Yiddish" to Ethical Reasoning 32: "Security" are up and running on Vimeo, ready for your perusal.
We at Flyby have some personal favorites, and in honor of the Academy we've created awards to recognize this semester's best course trailers. Check out these videos while you're procrastinating packing those suitcases.
Best Score: Culture and Belief 56: "The Culture of Capitalism"
From the urgent and almost alarming sounds of the opening sequence to the period band music throughout, this trailer is worth listening to at least once.
Best Use of Photography: United States and the World 26: "Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States"
This trailer combines commentary with black-and-white imagery from the civil rights and women's rights movements to transport the viewer back into the American past. Keep your eyes peeled for an especially adorable photo of an interracial couple 0:27 seconds in.

Not to mention, the two course heads—Andrew Richardson, an assistant professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, and Donald H. Pfister, a systematic biology professor—promote their class in a scene filmed in the beautiful, leafy Yard.
