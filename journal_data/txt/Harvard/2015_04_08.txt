Nothing about the physical set-up of The Hypocrites’ production of “The Mikado,” which ran March 31-April 5 at the Oberon, should have worked. All of the performers played their own idiosyncratic instruments—instead of using the classical accompaniment one expects of late 19th-century operetta, they strummed mandolins, blew saxophones, and played delightful miniature blue harpsichords, among many other folky hand-held instruments. While playing, singing, and acting, the performers also pranced from perch to perch in the Oberon’s open space, displacing lounging spectators with respectful taps on their shoulders. This does not even delve into the hundreds of balloons bouncing around the space, the Orientalist content of the play, or the fact that each lead also plays a supporting role of the opposite gender. That The Hypocrites’ “Mikado”, in spite of a deck intentionally stacked miles from coherence, was uproarious, sounded beautiful, and didn’t result in a banjo through someone’s eye was a true triumph for all involved.
The Hypocrites’ co-founder, Sean Graney, directed and adapted the 1885 work, occasionally replacing ornery language with contemporary pop-culture references. The result was a simplified yet still identifiably Victorian vision of the complex courtship between Nanki-Poo (Shawn Pfautsch), a royal in disguise, and Yum-Yum (Emily Casey), a maiden unhappily betrothed to Ko-Ko (Rob McLean), the Lord High Executioner of Japanese town facsimile Titipu. Other players included the overworked Pooh-Bah (Matt Kahler), who plays almost every bureaucratic role in Titipu, and Pitti-Sing (Lauren Vogel) and Peep-Bo (Dana Omar), Yum-Yum’s fellow maids. Graney deleted much of the context and racial politics to arrive at a snug 80-minute running time, less than half the duration of the original production. Within the abridged structure, however, he somehow managed to include almost all of the major numbers—“The sun whose rays are all ablaze,” and “Three little maids from school are we” appeared in their full glory—and to tie together the truly inexplicable turns of the plot at least somewhat cogently.
Co-director Thrisa Hodits and music director Andra Velis Simon deserve endless credit for having taken Graney’s frenetic adaptation and made it work both spatially and musically. The characters bounded around constantly, performing on the Oberon’s wrap-around balcony, stage, elevated seating area, and almost everywhere else in the vicinity. The movements, however, never appeared random or contrived. For example, when Nanki-Poo professed his love for Yum-Yum, he appropriately stood on a central dais. Katisha, Nanki-Poo’s spurned lover—also played by Pfautsch, in drag and self-accompanying on a glimmering sax that occasionally slipped into Gerry Rafferty’s mournful 1978 “Baker Street”—raged in on the right. Moreover, all of the players were more than cogent on their chosen instruments, while some, most notably the hilarious Mouse 1 (Doug Pawlik), played several with astonishing panache. In short, the wacky staging and instrumentation appeared not as pure gimmickry but rather as dexterous, if sometimes overwrought, choices to use the dynamic cast in as many ways as possible.
The cast’s moments of complete adherence to refined pronunciation and classical style acted as a collective reminder of the iconic nature of “The Mikado” score. There were moments, particularly in some of Koko’s numbers, where the operatic nature of the music was entirely lost and replaced with a vocal style more appropriate for rock opera. Even McLean’s occasional gruffness, however, took on vibrato and appeared supported at the moments it was most needed. As Pitti-Sing, Vogel buoyed the sopranos with reliable high-notes, and Kahler’s booming bass would have been believable on a more operatic stage. Some moments, however, required suspension of belief in the vocal integrity of the score, when country tonk and rock influences intentionally seeped through. That being said, the fact that any semblance of classical singing still existed within the cultural, musical, and physical pastiche of the show was a miracle in itself and thrilling when it came through most clearly.
Besides Ko-Ko’s sometimes strained voice, the acting, singing, and instrumentation were universally successful.  Pfautsch’s flamboyant Nanki-Poo, who was the butt of several groan-worthy jokes about his sexuality, was both likable and insufferable, while Casey’s Yum-Yum embodied sweetness and sincerity. Their chemistry, while decidedly non-sexual, elevated the show while allowing the more extreme supporting roles to run wild. The giddiness with which the actors presented their work and the wildly diverse ways in which Hodits and Velis Simon enabled them to do so made the show feel like a brand new piece, despite its obvious datedness. Even though the very performance of “The Mikado” has drawn criticism in recent years for its racist tones, it’s hard to imagine a more creative reclamation of the work.

Staging opera is difficult. There is something twee to lush period productions; there is something objectionable to excessive and irrelevant grotesqueries of Regietheater. A middle path—stagings that are significant and meaningful for modern audiences, but still loyal to the spirit of their original librettos—is hard to find. Happily, the Lowell House Opera’s production of Tchaikovsky’s “Queen of Spades,” which ran March 25 through April 4,  navigated this problem with aplomb and magnificence.
Gherman, played by Mikhail Urusov and Adam Klein on alternating nights, is a patient in a mental hospital who has two obsessions: cards and Liza (Zoya Gramagin and Samantha Schmid). Liza is engaged to Yeletsky (Adam Pistole and Jacob Scharfman), to Gherman’s deep chagrin. The mental patient machinates to extract the card-playing secrets of Liza’s mother, the Countess or “the Queen of Spades,” (Kylee Slee and Giliana Norkunas), so that he may amass a fortune and elope with his beloved.
The staging was styled after German Expressionist films of the early twentieth century. The violent angles of the monochromatic backdrop especially echoed “Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari”—a suitable design decision, as much of the action of both works takes place in insane asyla. Oddly shaped walls and windows provide an ample number of crannies to accommodate characters abruptly entering and hiding during scenes. The sparse decoration of the set (gray walls, a few items of unornamented gray furniture) prevented its geometry from overwhelming the performance; rather, clean lines directed the eye to the centers of action. Costuming and makeup design followed a similar approach—most of the ensemble wore white coats, and the simplicity of the heavily stylized makeup (mostly just powder and black lipstick for the majority of the cast) emphasized the acting rather than distracted from it. Expressionism was a very canny choice: the aesthetic is historically distant enough from the modern audience to give the production an air of slight archaism, but close enough that the staging did not become mere spectacle; further, Expressionism’s visual vocabulary is almost unparalleled by any other modern art movement, which gave the production tremendous reserves of powerful images upon which to draw.
The musical aspect of the performance rose to superb virtuosity. Urusov’s performance of Gherman was showstopping: the power and clarity of his voice filled the performance space, and at the same time his acting was convincing and even moving, flying in the face of the stereotype of cartoonish operatic histrionics. The orchestra’s performance was very strong, in spite of the acoustic difficulty of the Lowell dining hall. Generally speaking, brass avoided overwhelming other sections, which was remarkable for such a resonant space.
The few weak spots in the production were generally issues of acting, which is admittedly an ancillary concern in opera. Samantha Schmid’s Liza wore an almost uniformly pained and disgusted expression that stood in harsh contrast to the sensitivity of Urusov’s Gherman. Irina Kareva’s Pauline had similarly unconvincing acting; additionally, her voice sounded somewhat strained during her solo near the end of the first act. Nevertheless, these difficulties detracted little or nothing from the production as a whole, which was defined by the strength of the staging’s conceit and the skill of the ensemble as a whole.
It is rare to find a perfect production, and indeed many would argue that there is no such thing. Whatever the case, Lowell House Opera’s “Queen of Spades” came very close. While its staging was perhaps not novel—the Metropolitan in recent years has been steering a similar middle ground between modern foolishness and tacky historical slavishness—its success in execution was outstanding even among good productions.

“The magistrates haven’t come, but when they have—late—they’ll shove each other about in thronging bunches for the first seat; they won’t give a thought to making peace. Oh, my city, my city!”—Aristophanes, “Acharnians,” 23-27
In 425 BC, not long after the start of the Peloponnesian War, Aristophanes’s “Acharnians” premiered at the Athenian Lenaia, a January festival whose highlight was a competition among playwrights. The play follows the travails of the citizen Dicaeopolis (a Greek compound meaning “the just city”), who, having grown weary of the strictures imposed by the war, draws up a separate personal treaty with the Spartans and flourishes among many wine- and sex-fueled hijinks.
“Acharnians” can be identified as the earliest extant piece of activist theater: a play with an overt social and especially political message, striving to persuade as well as to entertain. Having grown out of the archaic lyric tradition, which included works of early social philosophy (for example, Solon) and blistering diatribes against individual leaders (for example, Alcaeus), Greek theater had a natural political bent. Indeed, of Aristophanes’s 11 surviving plays, only two, “The Birds” and “Thesmophoriazusae,” do not deal directly with political themes. Social conditions and influencing social change were primary concerns for ancient drama. How do Greek drama’s modern descendants follow in this path? While there is much contemporary theater devoted to political and social topics, the approaches vary, as do the philosophical implications. In particular, activist theater on college campuses provides interesting illustrations of these variations.
The thread from Aristophanes to modern theater is far from unbroken. Athenian democracy, a tenuous institution in the best of times, soon gave way to the Hellenistic kingdoms that followed in Alexander’s footsteps. Under these new regimes, dissent from imperial ideology was not permissible, and drama turned its eyes from the public sphere to the private. It is in this “New Comedy” period that the comedy of manners was born, the form that was imported to the Roman stage. Political and social discourse in Rome was limited to the genres of oratory, history, and satire, and after the emergence of the principate, the scope for criticism in these was increasingly limited.
In the medieval period, aggressive social commentary again appeared on the stage. The Goliards, a class of impoverished scholars and minor clergy, would set up elaborate liturgical parodies lampooning the ecclesiastical elite. The “Gamblers’ Mass” featured a mock liturgy with dice-playing on the altar instead of the consecration of the host (a detailed discussion of these phenomena can be found in Martha Bayless’s book “Parody in the Middle Ages”). Under the increasingly powerful national secular governments of Europe and in the midst of serious religious strife and reform, this give-and-take tradition was largely lost. By the time of Marlowe and Shakespeare, the political teeth of the theater had almost disappeared, and the official ideologies of patrons and potential patrons were given unquestioned pride of place. In the midst of the spirit of post-Enlightenment liberalizing, controversy gradually returned to the stage through the nineteenth century, overcoming censors and obscenity laws. It is from this renewed freedom that the modern strand of political theater descends.
There are numerous ways to convey a message, but theater has particular advantages. “The live experience you get from theatre is really unparalleled in other forms of art. Being in the room or the theater or the black box with other people and seeing another real person do things can really cut right into someone and really affect them,” says S. Jumai Yusuf ’16. Yusuf directed last semester’s “Negative,” a play that explored racial dynamics on Harvard’s campus. “Going to the theater also has this social aspect because you’re surrounded by other people [in the audience],” she says.
Magdalene M. Zier ’16, president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, agrees that political issues can go hand in hand with good theater and are considered when HRDC reviews show proposals for the Loeb Experimental Theater and the Loeb Mainstage. “We do like someone coming in with a very strong vision; like if they’re saying, ‘I feel very passionate about this issue and I want to use this show to discuss that,’ and they articulated that well, that can only add to their application,” she says.
It is one thing to choose a message to present; it is another to choose the method of presentation. One approach to political theater is typified by devoting the lion’s share of attention to the quality of the play itself as a piece of art.
Erin Murphy is a senior majoring in theater at Mount Holyoke University and the current chair of Project Theatre, Mount Holyoke’s main extracurricular theater organization. Project Theatre drew national attention late last year for cancelling a production of “The Vagina Monologues” in favor of a trans-inclusive play. Murphy says the selected work, “Student Body,” an original play, examined issues of more pressing interest to the student population, while “The Vagina Monologues,” which has traditionally been performed annually, would not necessarily spark the same sort of discussion. She believes that activism is central to campus theater. “Mount Holyoke is a community that is really dedicated to social justice work and being really conscious in whatever you’re doing, whether it’s theater or science or anything,” she says.
At the same time, her focus is on the show itself. “I hesitate to say I do activist theater because I do all theater. Any theater that I’ve done that’s had any activist bent or social justice bent to it is because that’s the show that we’re doing,” says Murphy.
Similarly, Yusuf’s play “Negative” pursued the end of examining and promoting discussion of Harvard’s race and class dynamics. It accomplished this through an interesting structure: In the first act, the two protagonists, one from a wealthy and privileged background, one poor and disadvantaged, were first played by a black actress and white actress respectively; in the second act, the actresses changed roles and played out the same events. Beyond this interesting internal structure, however, the play sought to convey its message by directly engaging the audience. Viewers were given index cards on which to write their reactions to the first and second acts. These were collected and, in a talkback moderated by Sustained Dialogue, the audience and the staff and actors in the production had a discussion about the play and the audience reactions to it. “It really surprised me to see how emotional some people got,” Yusuf says. “The whole talkback thing got really personal for them—they talked about experiences they actually had freshman year at Harvard with their roommates or something like that.” This entire process was heavily oriented towards maximizing the audience’s interaction with the text and its message.
At the same time, a balance must be maintained between the clarity of a play’s point and its virtue qua art. “I don’t think I would choose a show just based on the fact that it’s well-written, but it’s also bad to just choose a show based on the message if it’s just not a good play,” Yusuf says. “It’s better when the message comes off more subtly.”
Murphy and Yusuf typify a particular way of dealing with socially conscious theater: While message is important, they believe that the play itself must be worthy art to best convey that message.
A different approach is to elevate the message to the place of importance, putting all other aspects of the play in service to the desired moral. Carolyn Levy is a professor of theater at Hamline University, where she directs the student-manned Making Waves Social Justice Theatre Troupe, whose website declares that it “uses the art of performance to provoke dialogue about race, gender, class and other issues that can threaten our diverse and collaborative community of learners.” Levy came of age at Cornell during the anti-Vietnam War movement and participated in the 1970 national student strike.“One of the things I had to do and I had to go and tell each of my professors what I was doing.… I went to my acting teacher, and my acting teacher, whom I considered my mentor at that time, told me I could either be committed to my politics or to my work in the theater, but I couldn’t do both,” Levy says. “I was very young and very much believed him and so kept those two parts of my life very separate for a very long time.... It was probably about 10 years later that I began to figure out that using theater around issues of social change was important, that that’s what I wanted to do.”
Perhaps due to this background, Making Waves takes a more radical approach to provoking social change than many theater practitioners do. First, all of its plays are based on direct experience. “We do all the writing and just about everything we do is based on something real, some story that a student as shared with us,” says Levy. More importantly, the troupe’s work is philosophically grounded in the direct involvement of the audience. “The Theatre of the Oppressed is a way created by Augusto Boal, a way of engaging the audience and not allowing the audience to maintain themselves as spectators,” says Levy. “Boal called them ‘spect-actors’ instead of spectators, and really had this idea that if you sit back as an audience member and just watch the play, it’s too easy just to say, ‘Oh, that was neat,’ or, ‘Oh, that was interesting,’ or, ‘Oh, boy, that was moving,’ or, ‘Oh, that was tough; they were talking about some really heavy stuff,’ but not engage any further than that.”
Instead of this passive reception of a play, the audience members are given the opportunity to ask questions of the actors while they are still in character. Viewers then re-enact scenes from the plays, trying to take a better approach to a situation than the character whose place they are taking. While Levy still uses talkbacks as Yusuf did, she feels that the direct involvement of the viewer in the story is far more important. “Talkbacks, in my opinion, only go so far,” she says.
The group’s productions are sparse to the point of austerity: In lieu of costumes, actors wear T-shirts with the troupe’s logo, and props are limited to backpacks or books that the actors happen to have on hand. This sparsity grants the troupe a high degree of mobility, allowing them to perform easily before classes, conferences, and professional meetings—roughly 30 times per year, Levy says. In short, the productions are designed above all to convey their educational point directly and in any context; they have a singular, pedagogic purpose. This purpose is centered on the community at Hamline University but is generalizable to society at large.
“We do have a mission, and our mission is very much to help the campus address some of these issues—not just to learn about racism, but so that people are actually changing how they’re acting and making the campus a better place,” Levy says. “We can make the community a better place, and that may be what some people call propaganda.”
Theater, and all art, can be put in service of a cause. Indeed, perhaps all art is in service of a cause, intentionally or not; perhaps art for art’s sake is a meaningless slogan. There is an inherent discomfort with the idea of propaganda; but, at the end of the discussion, is it really different from any other literary or artistic product? Or is it the limiting case, the most effective form, of what other works try to do anyway? “We are about changing the campus, we are about changing the way people are treated,” says Levy. Theater is a powerful tool in swaying opinions and effecting political change, affecting even issues of life and death: Plato cites Aristophanes’s caricature of Socrates in “Clouds” as a decisive factor in poisoning the Athenian citizenry against the philosopher. Determining the most effective methods of persuasion within the art will help us better understand how it can be used responsibly.

It’s been a quick maturation process for British synthpop trio Years & Years; since 2012, the group has gone through its fair share of growing pains, slimming down from five members to three when they lost electronic musicians Noel Leeman and Oliver Subria and struggling through the release of a bevy of promising but flawed EPs. In their new song, “Worship,” the band shows that they have weathered the storm. The first single from their anticipated June debut studio album, “Communion,” the song showcases the ability of Years & Years to stick to the tenets of their smooth electro-pop style while refining their sound.
The band officially received their indie stamp of approval early last year when they were signed by Kitsuné, the French label that launched electro-pop giants such as Phoenix and Cut Copy. Their third single,“Real,” quickly received attention for its its driving beat and sensuous R&B lyrics and helped to define the band as a power player in the indie-dance genre. “Worship” is a slight departure from “Real”: It is more fully fleshed out and embraces rhythms more emblematic of catchy pop than experimental electronic sounds. Whereas “Real” seems to be the right soundtrack for a cruise down the Pacific Coast Highway, with its drawn-out chords and humming lyrics, “Worship” would integrate seamlessly into a night of debauchery and dancing; its rhythm is instantly stirring, striking the delicate balance between pulsating beats and asynchronous synths.
“Worship” wastes no time in introducing the listener to a steady, solid beat that is complemented by lead singer Olly Alexander’s crooning words: “I’m holy, I want you to know it / Blind devotion / I’m holy, I want you to know it / And you’ll be my sacrifice.” Alexander’s words are hypnotizing at first listen but are complex when examined further: Are his chants to his object of affection beautifully worshipful or chilling? This apparent theme of religion is mirrored by the chanting hypnosis of the song, which contrasts murky synth with raging beats until the ambiguity of track becomes overwhelming. If “Worship” is any indication, the music community is in for quite a baptism at the hands of Years & Years.

“Mr. Wonderful” oozes bravado. For fans of Action Bronson—the large, boisterous former gourmet chef—this should come as no surprise. On his psychedelia-infused major label debut, Bronson tackles many themes he has addressed in his past work: food, New York (he’s a proud native of Queens), and the extravagances of his lifestyle. The album isn’t standard fare—it’s a mature exploration of his new fame. Bronson raps, in his distinct New York accent, about the struggle to reconcile his roots with his newfound wealth as well as his struggles with relationships and addiction. Here, he’s more serious and raps less about food than in his numerous EPs, but he’s still the same goofily nick-named “Bronsolino” that fans have come to love. He breaches this new territory with aplomb and balances honest, personal themes of internal struggle with his carefree attitude and incisive wordplay, resulting in a successful execution of an ambitious album.
The album “Mr. Wonderful” stumbles to a start with “Brand New Car”—Bronson purposefully retains errors from the recording process as a means of welcoming his listeners to his rough production and vocals. Over an energetic sample from Billy Joel’s “Zanzibar,”­ Bronson, amidst the intentional blemishes, asserts his dominant presence with swaggering verses. The song is not his strongest, but through its persistent energy it sets the tone for the remainder of the work.
Bronson quickly recovers, and by “Terry,” the album’s third track, finds the tone that works best for him. In his lyrics, he strikes a perfect balance between his honesty—from the first utterance of “Don’t hurt me again,” he establishes his affecting vulnerability—and his familiar carefree love of luxury (“Smoke good, fuck, eat, drink / Drive nice car, wear all green mink” he repeats in the outro). The relaxed but persistent jazz guitar alongside his beats keeps the work focused and moving forward until it slips into a dreamy soundscape for the last minute. At this point, collaborator Chauncy Sherod eerily sings, “What are we waiting for?” leading into one of the strongest tracks on the album: “Actin’ Crazy.” The tight, mesmerizing beats from producers 40 and Omen perfectly complement the aggressive Bronson and keep the hook engaging without sacrificing experimental instrumentation.
By far the most fascinating ambition of the album is the psychedelia and prog-­rock- influenced suite sparked by “THUG LOVE STORY 2017 THE MUSICAL (Interlude),” which includes “City Boy Blues,” “A Light in the Addict,” and the single “Baby Blue” (feat. Chance the Rapper). The first two tracks flow together seamlessly, in a production style reminiscent of early Pink Floyd, and describe feelings of depression and loneliness. In “City Boy Blues,” which is entirely sung as opposed to rapped, Bronson describes his experiences with sycophantic followers, singing, “She only wants money from me / Love from somebody else.” “A Light in the Addict” is similarly dark, as Bronson confronts his mortality (“Thinkin’ if I jump, will I feel it when I hit the ground?”). By far the sharpest track in the trio is “Baby Blue,” which is stylistically less experimental and far more representative of Bronson’s traditional subject matter. The song features an infectiously catchy and surprisingly soulful hook from Bronson himself and a compelling verse from Chance the Rapper. The strongest aspect of “Baby Blue,” however, is the tight, piano-­driven beat from Mark Ronson. The “musical” is ultimately engaging, but the stylistic asymmetry abandons the experimental momentum built up in the first two tracks of the “THUG LOVE STORY 2017 THE MUSICAL” suite, sacrificing the potential payoff for the guaranteed successes of the “Baby Blue.” It’s a sensible but anticlimactic choice.
The album’s biggest problems are its wavering consistency in production style and quality. Songs vacillate between the extremes of the highly polished arena rap of “Actin Crazy” and “Baby Blue” and the rough, blues instrumentation on “The Rising” and “City Boy Blues.” Both styles work for Bronson, but the lack of commitment to either disrupts the flow of the album. Some pieces, particularly stripped-down antagonism of “Falconry” and the hair metal-inspired “Only in America,” appear to come out of nowhere, without bringing anything new to the table. At the beginning of “Only in America,” Bronson hypes himself up, saying, “I’m focused, man,” as though he isn’t quite convinced. His own uncertainty extends to the listener, and the song falls flat.
Although the album is at times uneven, Bronson’s ambitions pay off remarkably. His potent self-confidence keeps “Mr. Wonderful” interesting, even at its most distracted. The strength of the singles and focused experimentalism result in a cohesive and engaging work. On the hook of the final track, “Easy Rider,” Bronson triumphantly and knowingly repeats “[I] ride the Harley into the sunset.” Action Bronson’s motorcycle might be a ridiculously overblown image, but the very fact that he embraces his own maximalism makes “Mr. Wonderful” a worthwhile ride.

The Harvard-Allston Task Force will meet again Wednesday evening for the first time in more than 100 days. On the agenda are Harvard’s proposed community benefits package and the plans for several new buildings for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which plans to move two-thirds of its faculty to Allston facilities in 2019. After several years of strained relations with the Allston community, this meeting represents an opportunity for Harvard to show good faith and build a relationship that can provide lasting benefits for the university and the Allston community.
The relationship Harvard and Allston community members reached a low point in 2009, after the financial crisis, when the university put on hold and then scaled back its development plans. Having bought up much of its land in Allston in secret, Harvard left it largely undeveloped during the worst of the recession, which community members say only further damaged the local economy.
Dialogue through the Task Force and similar institutions has improved this relationship over time, but many community members remain concerned that Harvard is indifferent to their input, and would like to see more details about upcoming projects.
Chief among the topics slated for discussion is Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for expansion in Allston. Boston planning law requires that institutions with over 150,000 square feet of tax-exempt real estate, such as colleges, universities and hospitals, must submit an IMP. The document must describe all changes entailed in new development projects, including growth projections and details about community benefits. Harvard’s IMP for Allston includes a $43 million community benefits package, a major part of which is the 0.7-acre Brookline Machine site, which houses an abandoned factory scheduled for demolition. Many want the site to be used for affordable housing developments, while Harvard has signaled that the $43 million dollar offer may be its upper limit for funding, a figure with which some task force members remain unsatisfied.
Harvard can and should do more to combat the lingering difference between it and Allston residents. By being more concrete about its timeline and building construction plans, Harvard can signal that it cares about residents’ concerns. Members of the task force have expressed a desire for these steps, and they would be seen as an investment in a smoother and more trusting relationship with Allston residents into the future.
Ultimately, as a private landowner, Harvard should have independence in its decisions about the design and layout of its new campus. But as a part of the broader Allston community, Harvard also has a responsibility to show good faith to its neighbors and to take their concerns seriously. As projects in Allston continue and the neighborhood becomes an even more significant part of the University, Harvard should strive to communicate with residents clearly and continue to improve its relationships across the Charles.

UPDATED: April 8, 2015, at 1:45 p.m.
As students of Islamic history, we are shocked by the arguments advanced by Harvard freshman Lisa Peng in a recent Crimson article and feel compelled to respond.
The gist of Peng’s argument is that prominent Western politicians are actively prohibiting criticism of Islam, thereby violating free speech. Peng argues that Islam, a religion in need of serious reform, is harmed by this restriction since it hinders the progress that inevitably follows critical discourse. Peng posits Hirsi Ali as an exemplary defender of free speech, someone seeking to enrich Islam with the light of (Western) critique.
First, while President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron have stated that the religion of Islam has nothing to do with the killings perpetrated by some who claim to be Muslim, this in no way constitutes an attack on free speech. One need only observe the popularity of Bill Maher, Sam Harris, and Fox News to see that criticism of Islam is alive and well in American society.
Peng actually has it backwards. Political discourse is not limiting criticism of Islam; it is actively alienating Muslims. Take, for example, France’s ban on face veils, Denmark’s prohibition of halal food, and Switzerland’s ban on constructing minarets. Thirty two U.S. states have now debated the banning of “Shari’a law,” and seven have passed such legislation, although there was never a threat of Shari’a being implemented in America. The motivation behind these bans is clear: Islamophobic paranoia. This industry of fear has permeated our culture, and we have seen the danger that such hatred poses to Muslims living in the West in the recent incidents of fear-mongering, hate crimes, shootings, and tragic murders.
Having established that this is not a matter of freedom of speech, let us move to the subject of Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She has taught formal reading groups at the Kennedy School, many of which engage the field of Islamic Studies directly. This would appear to require at least some formal study of Islam, but no one has cared to ask whether she has the appropriate credentials. Hirsi Ali has no academic background in Islamic studies. It seems her credibility is simply assumed due to either her celebrity or prior experiences as a Muslim. We find it troubling that Harvard lends tremendous credibility to the ideas of someone who has no education in the topic that she teaches about, and specifically such a complex topic as wholesale theological reform, which necessitates knowledge of centuries of theological and legal discourse.
In her article, Peng writes that “only through rigorous scrutiny can cultures progress.” Taking this advice, let us submit Hirsi Ali’s ideas to critical examination in order to advance the discourse on modern Islam. Hirsi Ali preaches that Islam is “not a religion of peace” and that there are five central tenets of Islam, including such fundamental notions as the divine authorship of the Qur’an, that must be reformed for Islam to “peacefully coexist...in the modern world.”
Scholars of religion have exposed the flaws of the association of religion and violence so fundamental to the arguments spewed by Hirsi Ali and others. In his book "The Myth of Religious Violence" William Cavanaugh writes, “The idea that religion causes violence is one of the most prevalent myths of Western culture.” Cavanaugh suggests that it is only through the Western understanding of religion, which is unique and not universally true, that religions are seen as irrational and prone to violence. It is in fact one of the founding myths of modern Western liberalism. He insightfully extrapolates that this “myth” is used to legitimate “neo-colonial violence,” particularly against the Muslim world.
Karen Armstrong, in her new book "Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence," argues that productive discussion on contemporary violence should move away from simply blaming religion. This, she argues, is “burnt into secular Western consciousness” because of the history of the Hundred Years War in Europe, and the propensity to blame the extreme violence that took place on religious beliefs. This is, however, an historical inaccuracy. Armstrong makes it clear that there were a variety of factors, mostly political, that brought about these egregious wars. Elsewhere, she urges us to view ISIS fighters not simply as zealous Muslims, but on the contrary, genuine products of Western culture. Her research has shown that almost all of the individuals involved in September 11, the Boston Marathon bombings, and ISIS have astoundingly little knowledge of Islam.
If scholarship isn’t enough, the recent statements by Didier Francois, a French journalist kidnapped by ISIS, lend support to this idea. He tells reporters that amongst the ISIS fighters “there was never really a discussion about texts—it was not a religious discussion. It was a political discussion.” He also revealed that they played Western video games and watched Western films. These are young Westerners who find little meaning in life, and in Durkheimian fashion fill that void through extreme acts like suicide and killing.
If we truly hope to eradicate these forms of violence, we cannot ignore the histories of colonialism, imperialism, and economic exploitation that still plague the non-Western world. It is not the texts of Islam—as Hirsi Ali supposes—that are in need of reform. What needs to change are the toxic political and social conditions, present in both Western and Muslim lands, that lead to the alienation and anger that produce these violent outcomes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The feeling of loneliness is not glamorous or impressive; it does not announce itself. It is mostly never around, but it chooses to keep you company in those moments in which you would much rather be alone. Loneliness, in it’s temporary and non-venomous form is not the worst of human emotions. There are many that are worse—helplessness, hopelessness, grief. And though ubiquitous, it is usually impermanent, and usually treatable.
I am speaking not of romantic loneliness or sexual frustration, but rather the vague feeling of disconnectedness from the people around you—a feature of college life that I suspect is more prevalent than most of us would like to admit. Where does it come from—I’d like to explore a few theories.
The first is easy—that you meet people through groups and organizations, or in classes, where you are constantly evaluating their utility. Even in moments of community, there is the communal understanding among students that friendships are inevitably transactional. I will befriend you so long as a certain “convenience + utility” threshold is reached.
I don’t have a problem with this so much. From some angles, all voluntary human interaction is mutually beneficial and therefore transactional. Perhaps there are some people who approach college as one big networking event but I won’t stay with them for long—I don’t think most students here are like this.
The second is more subtle, and it centers around Harvard’s value. Another undercurrent of communal knowledge is that Harvard is a place of phenomenal opportunity, and that the vast majority of fellow students are wise enough to recognize this. Therefore, most of the people around us are under obligation to capitalize upon this opportunity and maximize personal growth. On its own, this does not preclude altruistic behavior, but it does mean that we all implicitly understand that “look out for number one” is everyone's first prerogative—any caring and attention that's left over can then be distributed out.
I am constantly aware of how precious other people's time here is, and that to impinge upon that would be socially and morally unacceptable. I must therefore approach people with a specific purpose—an agenda. I know that every minute I spend with an acquaintance is being weighed against the opportunity cost of such interaction. How many words in her paper might my friend have written if they hadn't agreed to this conversation. How much progress might she have made on her problem set. My conversation had better be worth at least that much. In order to spend time with our friends we need excuses, and then clubs, organizations, and buildings.
Perhaps these truths apply to life more generally, but the pressures Harvard places on us make them uniquely apparent.
Not all relationships must be like this. When I think of familial relationships, or some friendships from high school, or long-term romantic relationships, there is a different shared narrative. That I am first committed to this friendship, and this means that no matter how badly you mess up, I will still be there—at least for a while. Instead of having to constantly prove yourself, you are free to explore your surroundings in the knowledge that there is always someone on the other end of the rope.
The final argument is about the structure of Harvard life. Since food, lodging and most basic human needs are taken care of by some celestial deity, we do not ever need to rely on our peers—at least for those fundamental needs. This is unlike some lifestyle set-ups where small groups of people live in houses together, cook for one another, commute together, and are in general responsible for one another’s survival needs. Living in reliance on other people in this way also forces you to see them in their lesser moments, and to accept them even when they are not dressed up to go out. At Harvard, where we are preened and pampered, it is possible to live completely independently from your peers, and in consequence, to disappear without a trace. If you stopped texting people to meet up for lunch, how long would it take before people noticed?
Your social life is the product of your own micromanagement—the groups you choose to join, the meetings you choose to make, the emails you choose to send—and not the social/structural conditions of Harvard life. You are responsible for your own loneliness.
College is incredible, and I have no doubt that loneliness is something that almost always increases in the months and years following graduation. But we should not forget that we are first and foremost creatures who are dependent on those around us—no matter how much college might lead us to believe the contrary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2015, at 10:52 p.m.
After the committee tasked with reviewing the Program in General Education issued an interim report earlier this semester, faculty members have started to share their ideas about the future structure of the program.
The interim report, which has been released internally to faculty members, is a precursor for a final document that the Gen Ed review committee will put forth later this year.
“In the Gen Ed Review Committee we've been focused on collecting feedback from faculty, and thinking about the details of our final report,” Gen Ed review committee chair Sean D. Kelly wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Earlier this semester, Kelly declined to name specific proposals included in the report, citing a desire to hear feedback from faculty first.
Many faculty members have said that they are unhappy with the current program and that changes need to be made, according to Edward J. Hall, the Committee on Gen Ed’s faculty chair and a Philosophy professor. The interim report, feedback from professors, and subsequently proposed solutions are all efforts to revise the program.
“There’s been feedback from [the interim report], and the review committee is now sort of going through the feedback,” Hall said. “I think we’ve gotten quite a lot of feedback, from fifty...faculty at least.”
According to Hall, some suggestions include reconsidering whether the current eight Gen Ed categories are “the right categories” for the program and reevaluating the possibility of distribution requirements to emphasize a broader liberal arts education.
The challenge is to balance the depth of the Gen Ed program with the breadth of courses offered, and there are “any number of ways to figure it out,” Hall said.
Kelly wrote that the committee is “expecting to present something at the May faculty meeting.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris declined to comment on the interim report and faculty response.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While some freshmen said they have appreciated the opportunity to explore the College’s 48 concentrations during the annual Advising Fortnight, others called the events impersonal and poorly timed during midterm season.
During the two-week period, which began last Monday, freshmen discuss possible academic fields with faculty and concentrators through lectures, student panels, open houses, and other events hosted by different departments. Each freshman is required "to have at least one advising conversation" during the period and report this conversation to an online portal by Friday, April 24, according to the Advising Fortnight website.
Some freshmen said Advising Fortnight has allowed them to explore a variety of fields, even those that they have no interest in pursuing further, and to talk with faculty members in different departments.
“It was pretty helpful,” Andre Sanchez ’18 said, regarding the concentration fair set up during the Advising Fortnight kickoff in Annenberg last Monday. “I was kind of impressed with all of the people willing to help and talk.”
Although Sanchez had “an idea” about his choice of concentration going into Advising Fortnight, he said the fair opened his eyes to what else is available.
Jessie M. Laurore ’18 said she also appreciated the opportunity to explore the breadth of academic possibilities at the College at the fair. “It was nice to see all of the concentrations in one room,” she said.
Other students said they found these bigger picture events impersonal, overwhelming, and ultimately unhelpful in guiding their decisions about the concentrations.
Janae M. Bell ’18, who is currently deciding between economics and psychology, found that arranging office hours with a teaching fellow was more informative than the events set up by the departments. Bell suggested that the Advising Fortnight agenda should emphasize setting up one-to-one advising conversations, like the one she scheduled on her own, rather than larger panels which were not as helpful.
Carlos Mendizabal ’18, who went to a computer science event, echoed Bell regarding the impersonal nature of the larger panels. According to Mendizabal, “actual discussion” happens when he goes to professors’ and TFs’ office hours.
“[The larger events shared] mostly basic information that I could have looked up by myself on concentrations’ websites,” Robert G. Erikson ’18 said.
Still other students cited scheduling drawbacks of Advising Fortnight, including how the event falls during midterms and how their classes and extracurricular commitments often overlap with panels and open houses they would have liked to attend.
“Most have conflicts with my classes,” Trevor L. Chistolini ’18 said. Chistolini added that, since he has an idea about what he will choose as his concentration, the events are “not really something geared towards me.”

Harvard professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Richard J. O’Connell passed away April 2 after a three-year battle with prostate cancer. O’Connell was an American Geophysical Union and American Association for the Advancement of Science fellow and a recipient of both the Inge Lehmann Medal and Arthur L. Day Medal. He was 73.
“Rick was a remarkable scientist and kind person. While his scientific accomplishments are far ranging, he was perhaps best known for his work modeling convection of the Earth’s mantle, a process driven by heat in the interior that governs plate tectonics,” John H. Shaw, chair of the EPS department, wrote in an email.
O’ Connell received a B.S. in physics, an M.S. in geology, and a Ph.D. in geophysics all from the California Institute of Technology. He came to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1971, and served as a professor of geophysics since 1977. He also directed the Center for Earth and Planetary Physics at Harvard from 1983 to 1986.
According to EPS professor Jerry X. Mitrovica, “[O’Connell] was a source of incredible knowledge and insight into the field.” Mitrovica described him as a scholar who was driven by curiosity and a gentleman with “a quick, dry, hilarious sense of humor.”
Colleagues said O’Connell not only left an impact on the future of his academic field, but also touched the lives of those who interacted with him.
“He was a person who always had time. His office door was always open, to both his colleagues and his students,” Mitrovica said. “He spent a significant amount of his time listening, laughing, giving advice, mentoring, and not just to scientists, but also to freshmen who came to Harvard not knowing what they wanted to do…. Students gravitated towards him as a mentor.”
“I hope Harvard understands what it’s lost,” Mitrovica added.
O’Connell also left a positive impression on his students. Sarah A. Moon ’15, an EPS concentrator who took O’Connell’s introductory course—The Dynamic Earth: "Geology and Tectonics Through Time"—described O’Connell as a professor who truly cared about undergraduates.
“He was always just so friendly and wonderful, and always willing to talk about your work or whatever else,” Moon said.
A note from his wife Susan and children, Brian and Lily, announced O’Connell’s passing and detailed plans for a memorial service planned to be held on May 2 at 4 p.m. in Boston’s King’s Chapel.
“We hope that when you see mention of Montana, or watch a sailboat tacking across the bay, or hear a particularly insightful scientific question posed, you will think of our ‘Cowboy Rick,’” O’Connell’s family wrote in the note. “[We hope] that the memory will bring a smile to your face, and you will consider raising a glass to a good friend, colleague, father, and husband, who brought joy to all our lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Florida federal judge struck from the record allegations of sexual misconduct against Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz on Monday. The judge will not allow “Jane Doe No. 3,” who has claimed that Dershowitz had sex with her while she was underage, to enter the ongoing federal court case as a party, though she can still testify as a witness.
The judge’s decision is the latest installment in an ongoing saga of allegations and refutations between Dershowitz and “Jane Doe No. 3.” The controversy began with a filing late last year to a civil court case that challenges a plea deal negotiated for Jeffrey E. Epstein, who went to state prison for 18 months for soliciting prostitution from a minor and skirted federal prosecution.
The initial Dec. 30 filing ,which first alleged that Epstein forced “Jane Doe No. 3” to have sex with Dershowitz several times in a variety of locations, is part of this effort to challenge the plea deal that Dershowitz helped negotiate.
Dershowitz has continually denied that he had any kind of sexual relations with “Jane Doe No. 3,” and he filed to intervene in the case to clear his name. Both Dershowitz and Jane Doe No. 3 have signed sworn affidavits denying and affirming, respectively, the allegations.
The judge’s Monday decision annuls Dershowitz’s filing to intervene; the district court judge, Kenneth A. Marra, wrote “as the Court has taken it upon itself to strike the impertinent factual details [from the case]...the Court concludes that Mr. Dershowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary.”
The judge’s decision does not directly address the veracity of Jane Doe No. 3’s claims, but rather their relevance to the ongoing case. Still, Dershowitz said he was optimistic about the latest developments.
“As far as I’m concerned, it was a total vindication,” he said.
For their part, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, the lawyers representing “Jane Doe No. 3” and the rest of the victims challenging Epstein’s plea deal, wrote in an email that they were “pleased by the Court’s ruling recognizing that Jane Doe [3 and] 4 have a right to participate” as witnesses in the case.
“I’m happy to get to participate in this important case,” wrote “Jane Doe No. 3” in an emailed statement forwarded by her lawyers.
The legal struggle has not come to a close, though. Both Dershowitz and the two lawyers have sued one another for defamation, and Dershowitz said that he plans to continue his efforts to combat the accusations against him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of drafting and debate, members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously voted in favor of legislation that will require students at the College to make an affirmation of integrity at the beginning of each semester, as well as on final papers and examinations, starting next fall.
The Faculty also voted to approve a new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media, the proposal of which was first announced by the University in October 2014. The concentration will be available for students to declare starting next fall. Its governing committee, the Standing Committee on Theater, Dance, and Media, will be created July 1. According to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, the Faculty Council—the Faculty’s highest elected body—voted unanimously in approval of the concentration, with no abstentions.
Faculty members congratulated a beaming Martin Puchner, the English professor who spearheaded the effort to create the new concentration, after the meeting. Puchner said that the unanimous approval was a “huge excitement and relief.”
“It’s been long in the making,” Puchner said after the meeting. “It’s just wonderful that it’s happened and with such universal support.”
Prior to the Faculty vote, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented the legislation for the affirmation of integrity statement that undergraduates will now be required to make as part of the College’s new honor code. Under the policy, students must affirm their awareness of the honor code each time they register for the semester. Students will also be asked to affirm their awareness of the honor code during final exams, on final papers and projects—including theses—and on other assignments at the discretion of individual faculty members.
“The idea is to refine [students’] awareness of our bedrock principle of integrity,” Harris said when presenting the legislation to the Faculty. The Faculty Council had voted 15 in favor and one opposed to the legislation, with no abstentions.
The Faculty also voted in favor of changes to the 2015-2016 student handbook, which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana presented. These changes included the elimination of Pre-term planning, a system under which undergraduates were required to indicate the courses they intended to take in the following semester.
University President Drew G. Faust asked that all Faculty in attendance encourage their students to participate in Harvard’s sexual climate survey, which will be released to students across the University on April 12, in order to increase the survey’s statistical validity.
Faust also awarded three recently-tenured professors—Anthropology professor Jason A. Urr, Astronomy professor Edo Berger, and Chemistry professor Theodore A. Betley—honorary Masters Degrees from Harvard.
Smith also announced the newest members of the Faculty Council, who will begin their terms on July 1. They include Mathematics lecturer Paul G. Bamberg, Government professor Claudine Gay, Study of Religion professor Parimal G. Patil, Romance Language and Literatures associate professor Sylvaine Guyot, Anthropology associate professor Matthew Liebmann, and Molecular and Cellular Biology professor Susan Mango.
The meeting lasted about 20 minutes, and Faculty members asked no questions nor did they raise any concerns during the meeting’s question and discussion periods.

Harvard Business School will launch a new recruiting program targeting women’s colleges to address the underrepresentation of women in its student body, according to Deirdre C. Leopold, the managing director of HBS admissions and financial aid. Of the 1,859 MBA students currently enrolled in the Business School, 41 percent are female.
The program, called PEEK, will cost $500 per participant and aims to host about 70 to 80 rising juniors, seniors, and recent graduates during a weekend in June to expose them to the Business School and familiarize them with the MBA program, according to Leopold. This week, Business School administrators and staff, including Leopold, will visit Wellesley College and Barnard.
“This program is aimed at women at women-only colleges who may not have thought of a business school career,” Leopold said. She added that this is a way for prospective students “to literally take a peek at what happens in an MBA program.”
Intended as a “a short weekend experience,” the PEEK program would diverge from a more traditional visit in that prospective students will participate in assigned case studies, live on campus, and meet with faculty, current students, and alumni, Leopold said.
The Business School has grappled with gender imbalance since it began accepting women a little more than 50 years ago. Although the percentage of female students has grown from 25 percent in 1985, women still represent less than half of the admitted class.
According to the 2013-2014 annual report issued by the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, 20 percent of senior ladder faculty at the Business School are women, less than the overall 24 percent of women across the University’s tenured faculty.
In January 2014, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria pledged at an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of women MBAs at the school to double the percentage of female protagonists in Business School case studies over the next five years. At the event, Nohria apologized on behalf of the school, stating that women feel “disrespected, left out, and unloved by the school.” He then promised to make the problem “better.”
In recent years, the Business School has been working to reduce biases against women in classroom settings by installing scribes in classrooms and developing online tools to help professors keep track of class participation. In addition, the HBS Gender Initiative  was formed to promote gender equity in business. Leopold said the PEEK program is not affiliated with the two aforementioned efforts.

The Harvard-run New England Primate Medical Research Center has come under additional scrutiny following allegations that between 1999 and 2011, a dozen monkeys were found dead in their cages or euthanized at the center.
The news, first reported in The Boston Globe, comes about three years after the center, which is known for its HIV and neuroscience research but is set to close at the end of next month, came under fire for the care-related deaths of monkeys between 2010 and 2012.
The primate center is located in Southborough, Mass., run by the Medical School, and affiliated—according to its website—with the National Institutes of Health. The Globe report, released on Tuesday, details the cases of 12 additional monkeys who, according to records provided by a former leader of the center, were dehydrated when they died, all between 1999 and 2011.
According to the documents, which Dr. Frederick C. Wang first provided to the Globe and later shared with The Crimson, the dead monkeys lived in cages that had a number of issues—one cage was not equipped with a waterspout, another had a malfunctioning water line. Another monkey could not drink her water because she snagged her tooth in a jacket.
Wang, who served as interim director of the center at the the end of 2011 and the start of 2012—when three monkey deaths at the center were reported to the government—referenced a 2014 study that concluded that the primates stopped drinking because they fell sick. However, Wang said in a statement that he thought the human error in the “inadequate animal care” of the monkeys contributed to, and potentially skewed, the data.
The paper resulting from the study suggests that monkeys can spontaneously develop hypernatremia, which often results from dehydration. Wang challenged this paper, saying in his statement that it could inspire “unwarranted research.”
In an email, Wang wrote that he received the spreadsheet data detailing the monkey deaths from one of the authors of the 2014 study, Andrew Miller.
Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier could not be reached for comment on Tuesday night, nor could David Cameron, a spokesperson for the Medical School. A statement the Globe attributed to Harvard said that the center had not reported all of the deaths to the proper internal committee. The statement also said that when the school was notified of the data Wang shared with the Globe, “we consulted with the appropriate regulatory authority and proceeded as we were advised.”
The new report is not the first about care-related deaths at the primate center. In December 2013, the government fined the Medical School $24,036 for animal welfare violations, which included infractions relating to four primate deaths at the center.
In 2012, Flier suspended new experimentation at the center after five monkeys died within 19 months at Harvard facilities. In the recent Globe article, though, Flier said that the closure of the research center was not related to the animal care issues. Flier told The Crimson in 2013 that the center closed due to a lack of resources.
However, critics of the center question Flier’s justification for the closure. Alicia M. Rodriguez, president of the Harvard Law School Student Animal Legal Defense Fund, said she did not think it was a “coincidence” that the closure of the center was announced in the midst of scrutiny surrounding the monkey deaths.
“[With] multiple violations, it doesn’t seem to me that it was feasible for them to continue running the lab,” Rodriguez said. “I think the legacy was already a negative one, and the new documents that have come out have added to the negative press and the negative reputation the primate center has.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Posters that parodied a new campus arts and advocacy magazine that focuses on issues of race and diversity prompted criticism from students and administrators in Pforzheimer House this past weekend.
Last week, a group of undergraduates started the online magazine Renegade in an effort to showcase the writing and artwork of students of color. The group advertised its website by putting up posters around campus leading up to its official launch on Friday.
On Friday night, the day of the formal launch, Black Students Association President Sarah F. Cole ’16 emailed a photo of a Renegade poster that had been ripped in half over Pfoho’s House list, prompting responses from other students. One response included a photo of three posters that appeared to mock the magazine.
Official Renegade posters in Pfoho had white backgrounds with black text containing phrases about race and diversity, such as “because Mather owned slaves,” according to a statement on behalf of the group from Jenny A. Gathright ’16, a former Crimson editorial writer. The apparent parody posters, however, were black with white text and included the messages “because all straight white men are racist” and “because anyone that disagrees with me is racist.” The posters included the url of the magazine’s website and its launch date.
In her statement on behalf of Renegade, Gathright confirmed that “[a]ny other posters in Pfoho imitating the style and font of Renegade were not produced by or endorsed by Renegade.”
“These posters were put up by people outside of Renegade, presumably with the intention of mischaracterizing our mission and reducing the work we are trying to do on this campus,” Gathright’s statement said on behalf of the group.
“The production and distribution of these fake posters is an immature and unacceptable attack on students of color in Pfoho and across this campus who have come together to speak their truths,” the statement read.
Pforzheimer House Masters Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant reacted to the incident in an email to Pforzheimer residents on Saturday, writing that a Renegade magazine poster had been ripped in half the previous night and that they were “far more troubled” by “parodic” posters that had surfaced in the House.
“Whatever the intent behind these posters, their effect has been to potentially mislead our community about Renegade, and to personally hurt and undermine some members of that group who live here in Pfoho. That is absolutely unacceptable, and we intend to take those posters down immediately,” Harrington and Durant wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, clad in costume, Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 became president of the Undergraduate Council after winning a tumultuous election on a platform of bringing thicker toilet paper to student bathrooms and a particular kind of soup to dining halls. Alongside Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, Mayopoulos soon embarked on a high-profile—and ultimately unsuccessful—social media campaign to secure $250,000 in student group funding from administrators.
So far this year, the UC’s top leaders have taken on a different approach. Its new president and vice president, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, ran a traditional campaign, and since taking office, they have prioritized initiatives including a smartphone application package and a United Nations-inspired gender equity campaign, both of which have required little administrative support. At their semester meeting with University President Drew G. Faust, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal voiced no monetary demands.
“The leadup was certainly different. Gus and Sietse used the [Faust] meeting in a very public way in order to generate attention about one particular thing,” UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said. “Ava and Dhruv approached it more as a standard meeting.”
Unlike their predecessors, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal have expressed their desire to carry out plans for the Council without relying on administrators, preferring independently-run initiatives, raising the question of whether the UC should tackle larger student life projects or smaller ones that are easier to deliver.
PROMISING ‘DELIVERABLES’
Throughout the first few months of their term, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal have been vocal about their intent to rely less on high-level administrators. In UC general meetings and in conversation, they highlight an application package—which includes an events calendar and a remake of Harvard’s official app—and their “Side by Side” gender equity campaign as two examples of “deliverable” projects from which the leaders believe future students will benefit.
Administrators “are very supportive of what we’re doing, and we’re very grateful for that, but we’re not entirely dependent on them,” Goyal said in January. “In that sense, getting projects done is something we’re more confident about.”
This rhetoric began with their November campaign. Instead of asking administrators to increase funding for student groups, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal ran on a platform of soliciting alumni for that money. And while they have not yet laid out concrete plans for such a fundraising drive, they are planning to form an advisory network of UC alumni with the eventual goal of acquiring student group funding.
While the alumni advisory network’s primary goal is to gain funding, according to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, representatives must focus on first “building relationships” with alumni, which is likely to take some time.
This stands in stark contrast to the actions of Mayopoulos and Goffard, whose student group funding campaign was very public and dealt very directly with both students and administrators. Mayopoulos, for his part, acknowledges the disparity.
“They seem to be less dependent on the administration for their goals than we [were],” Mayopoulos said.
According to Mayopoulos, he got involved with the UC because he believed that the Council, prior to his and Goffard’s leadership, was not as visible to students. The Council “needed to be revitalized in the eyes of students,” Mayopoulos said. “I saw it as my charge to spread what the UC was doing.”
In general, a number of students—including Goyal and Biebelberg—argue that Mayopoulos and Goffard’s work last year successfully increased the visibility and efficacy of the Council as a whole. Their “UC 250K” campaign in particular generated a lot of student interest; before their meeting with Faust last February, students outside the UC joined Mayopoulos and Goffard in student rally, throwing toilet paper and delivering speeches.
According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, their predecessors, who raised the UC’s public profile, have allowed Council leaders to shift their focus to more tangible—and, as Goyal calls them, “deliverable”—goals.
“That visibility has allowed us to take our projects forward,” Goyal said. “Our projects would be nothing today without the increased visibility that Gus and Sietse gave us.”
MAKING PROGRESS?
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal argue that their decision to prioritize initiatives that do not directly involve administrators is at least in some ways more effective. Goyal cited “Harvard Oasis,” a March event that was funded by an anonymous donor, as an example of a successful, short-term initiative that the UC executed quickly in collaboration with other student groups. This kind of collaborative effort may not have been possible without Mayopoulos and Goffard’s tenure, Goyal said.
“It was pretty cool how they were able to do that,” said Faith A. Jackson ’16, who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in the fall’s UC leadership election and is not a member of the Council. “I feel like other administrations may not have been able to do something like that, because they would have been focused on more of those bigger initiatives.”
Others acknowledge that the current leaders’ approach can have benefits. Mayopoulos said the strategy can be effective, as working closely with administrators can lead to difficulty in terms of constantly having to ask for permission and funding.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, for his part, wrote in an email that Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal “have very quickly and effectively identified opportunities to make progress on a number of important projects.”
Still, some students argue that UC leaders should focus on bigger projects that require administrative support.
Nasrollahzadeh said Ventfull, the Council’s events calendar app, addresses exclusivity issues in that it “makes the already open and inclusive events on campus more visible.” But Jackson, who ran with the campaign promise of creating an inclusive and non-gendered social space for undergraduates, argued that the UC’s mobile app package and other small-scale initiatives do little to inflict meaningful change.
“At Harvard, there’s a whole separate issue over what students have access to. More information isn’t going to make final clubs more inclusive, right?” Jackson said.
Jackson added that despite an initial push for publicity, interest in the app has dwindled: “There’s no buzz around people wanting to use this anymore,” she said.
“I think that it’s a very superficial initiative,” she added. “I don’t think that [Ventfull] really attacks structural changes on campus.”
Mayopoulos adds that addressing some issues may require the benefits and burdens that stem from administrative collaboration. “There are issues that you do need to work with the administration on,” Mayopoulos said, pointing out the case of student group funding. He argued that Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal’s plan to solicit alumni funds for student groups may prove difficult and inefficient.
“It’s a huge challenge, and the University is really more equipped to do it than the UC is,” he said.
Still, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal say they are confident in the Council’s role as an instrument for change and add that they have more large-scale initiatives in mind. The Council plans to extend its gender campaign and reach out to student groups—potentially including final clubs—for gender equity pledges and eventually pass a piece of legislation with “action items” in order to increase communication between final clubs and recognized student groups like the UC. (Nasrollahzadeh is in a final club.)
Nasrollahzadeh has also expressed the desire to create a cultural center in the Smith Campus Center, which is not slated to undergo construction until 2016.
“While it may not seem like they’re flagship issues, they’re still making progress,” Mayopoulos said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Central Intelligence Agency Director John O. Brennan spoke at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday about the ongoing Iranian nuclear negotiations and the challenges of combating radical militant groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Belfer Center Director and former Kennedy School Dean Graham T. Allison, comes a little more than two years after Brennan was sworn in as CIA Director in March 2013. Brennan had previously served as the U.S. Homeland Security Advisor under President Barack Obama and as interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center he helped establish.
Brennan expressed approval of the framework deal revealed  last week on the future of the Iranian nuclear program, highlighting the new proposed inspection regimes and limits on enrichment as significant achievements.
“The individuals who say that this deal provides a pathway for Iran to a bomb are being wholly disingenuous in my view,” Brennan said. “If you look at…what it has done, preventing Iran, limiting Iran, for fifteen, twenty years in a variety of ways—I’m certainly pleasantly surprised that the Iranians have agreed to so much here.”
Brennan acknowledged, however, that Iran’s “track record of causing trouble in the region,” particularly “sponsoring different insurgencies,” warranted “carefully watch[ing]” the country regardless of the outcome of the nuclear negotiations.
When asked about ISIS, Brennan characterized the group as a force that many Middle Eastern governments, lacking sufficient military capabilities and institutions, are unable to challenge.
“Unquestionably, violence has become a way of life in these societies and cultures,” Brennan said. “The natural gravitational pull for people who are alienated with a lack of good governance, a lack of getting food and jobs, is to go to one of these groups that has as their raison d’être opposition to the central government.”
Brennan also said the U.S. counterterrorism effort was not in itself designed to resolve but rather provide time to resolve Middle Eastern tensions and crises.
“There’s no way that we can kill our way out of this challenge,” Brennan said. “We need to be able to stop those plots, those activities that threaten us as well as our partners and try to bring it down so that some of the political processes that need to take root can—that’s going to be a long and challenging road.”
Brennan also spoke about his ongoing effort to modernize the CIA and prepare it for a new age of asymmetric cyber warfare.
“The purpose behind this modernization effort is to make sure that CIA officers understand all of the arrows in our quiver, all of the things we can do that will be able to address our national security challenges,” Brennan said. “Different parts of the agency sometimes were separated from one another and compartmented and people didn’t have a full appreciation of some of the capabilities they could leverage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing tied for third at the NCAA championships two weeks ago, Harvard freshman fencer Eli Dershwitz won the World Junior Saber Title on Tuesday at the Cadet and Junior World Championships held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The next day, Dershwitz and his USA junior saber teammates took home a bronze medal in the team saber competition.
“I think [the individual title] was redemption and will boost his confidence, which is very, very important,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said.
Dershwitz, who is currently ranked second in the United States in the senior saber division, will be training for the 2016 Olympic Games in an attempt to make the U.S. saber team.
“He certainly is on his way up—it’s a big jump from a junior world title to the Olympic games, but I think he has good shot,” Brand said. “He dominated this event, which bodes well for his chances, and I think considering his abilities and his maturity...he has a very good chance of making the Olympic team.”
In the individual gold medal bout, Dershwitz defeated Italy’s Francesco Bonsanto, 15-7. Bonsanto had entered the championships as the No. 2 junior saber fencer in the world and had placed second at the 2015 European Junior Championships.
“[Having] fenced with [Dershwitz] since I was in seventh grade and he was in fifth grade, I’ve seen the long process of him being a little kid to moving up in the ranks not only nationally, but internationally [as well],” Crimson junior co-captain Duncan O’Brien said. “The past three years he’s had incredible results, not just in the under-19 category...but also on the senior circuit.”
Early in the bout, Dershwitz jumped out to a 7-2 lead and controlled the pace of the bout, maintaining a comfortable lead throughout.
Up 14-7 after a short review gave him another touch, Dershwitz took off his mask and pumped up the crowd. The decisive point came moments later.
“Whenever you see him on the strip, more than anybody that I’ve seen before in my career, he always has a shot at winning, no matter who he’s facing,” Brand said.
Dershwitz finished the initial pool play round with a 5-1 record, and his plus-17 indicator earned him the ninth seed out of 96 international competitors hailing from a wide breadth of countries such as Qatar, Australia, and Russia.
After receiving a bye in the round of 128, Dershwitz notched 15-7 and 15-12 victories in the rounds of 64 and 32 against Mexico’s Hector Florencia and Kuwait’s Bandar Alshamlan. The round of 16 round saw Dershwitz dismantle higher-seeded Jose Quintero of Venezuela, 15-6.
In the last two bouts leading up to the final, the Harvard standout defeated Russia’s Dmitriy Danilenko, who was the top seed from the pool bouts, and Egypt’s Mohamed Amer by scores of 15-8 and 15-10, respectively.
In the team event, Dershwitz was a key contributor to his team’s third-place finish. Though he was on the losing side of the 45-44 defeat at the hands of the Korean team, Dershwitz bounced back to close out the bronze-medal match against Poland’s Jakub Jaskot, notching the final five touches of the match to clinch the victory.
Dershwitz had a rough start, losing his bout against his Mexico team opponent. However, the U.S. team came back from eight touches down to take the match, 45-40.
Match No. 1 against France’s Edern Annic saw a better result from the Harvard freshman in the round of eight, with Dershwitz taking the bout. Dershwitz also closed out the team match with a win over Charles Colleau, sending the American squad to the semifinal.
“It’s incredible to train with a guy like him,” O’Brien said. “He’s so knowledgeable about the sport…[and] he adds so much to the [Harvard] team, both on and off the strip.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five years with the Crimson, women’s ice hockey associate coach Maura Crowell is set to become the head coach at the University of Minnesota Duluth following the departure of Bulldogs' head coach Shannon Miller.
The hiring was a long time coming according to Crowell, as the job opened in March when Miller stepped down. Crowell was interviewed over the phone for the position, and she visited the Minnesota Duluth campus following the NCAA championship game in Minneapolis.
“Within a week [of visiting campus], I had taken the job,” Crowell said. “There was a good amount of interest from both sides…and things happened quickly.”
During her tenure at Harvard, the Crimson netted three Ivy League titles, an Eastern College Athletic Conference tournament championship, and three NCAA tournament appearances.
Crowell has not only served as the associate head coach for the Crimson; she was also the head of the program last season. Serving as both associate coach and interim head coach last year when Katey Stone headed the United States 2014 Olympic team, Crowell tallied 23 wins and led the team to the semifinals of the ECAC—all without the help of standouts Lyndsey Fry, Michelle Picard, and Josephine Pucci, who all joined Stone on the U.S. Olympic team. The Harvard team went on to win the Ivy League title that year and made an appearance in the NCAA tournament quarterfinals.
“That was a big deal—getting the reins of a Division I program and having success last year,” Crowell said. “It definitely strengthen[ed] the resume and built confidence in my ability to be the head coach of a team on that level.”
Following Stone’s return to Cambridge, the team made a run to the championship game of the NCAA tournament, falling to Minnesota, 4-1, in the final.
Prior to her career at Harvard, Crowell served as the head coach at UMass Boston, where she led the Beacons to the ECAC tournament semifinals and became the winningest coach in UMass Boston history. While there, she also coached 11 all-conference players.
In her five years with the Crimson, Crowell became an integral part of the team, not only coaching in Stone’s absence but also becoming a fixture on the bench. Prior to her arrival, Harvard hadn’t gone to the NCAA tournament since the 2004 season.
“In my three years here she’s been the rock on the team,” junior forward Miye D’Oench said. “She’s so comforting and fun loving. Every day she brings so much energy to the rink and to the team, and it’s definitely a huge loss. But we wish her the best of luck as a team.”
The Minnesota Duluth hockey program has been and will likely continue to be a force to be reckoned with following the addition of Crowell. The team has gone to the NCAA Frozen Four seven times in the last 15 years and has been crowned champion five of those seven times. The team boasts over two dozen international Olympians among its alumni.
“My expectations are high,” Crowell said. “Obviously UMD has a storied history of winning and succeeding as well. We’ll have to see how the team and current roster plays out, but right now I’m just focusing on the process and rejuvenating the team out there.”
Crowell will be taking over a team that went 20-12-5 last season and reached the Western Collegiate Hockey Association playoffs before ultimately losing to Bemidji State. The loss put the Bulldogs out of the race for an NCAA Tournament berth.
Looking back at the team she is leaving behind, Crowell acknowledged that she has built strong ties with both the coaching staff and the student athletes. She stated that the aspect which she will miss the most is the work ethic and drive of the student-athletes. In turn, her presence alone will be missed by many.
“In practices, I’ll miss her presence and her sense of humor and the amount of fun she has out there with us,” D’Oench said. “In games, I’ll miss the steady communication and the direct way about her that we really need during games. Each game is different with every coach and I think she’s consistently brought a lot to the table.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each of the first three quarters of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s game against Boston University finished with the score tied, an indication of how close the contest was throughout.
Only one goal would be scored in the fourth quarter, as the Crimson’s season leader in points and Tewaarton Watch List candidate, junior attackman Devin Dwyer, scored the decisive goal to put Harvard on top to earn a tight 9-8 victory.
The Crimson (6-5, 1-2 Ivy) came into this game against a traditionally lackluster Terrier program (6-5, 3-3 Patriot League) on a high note, having beaten No. 6/8 Cornell last weekend and looking forward to tough conference games for the rest of the season against several of the top teams in the nation. BU, however, made it clear that they could not be overlooked, refusing to give ground to Harvard throughout the match.
“We certainly found a way to win,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But we were disappointed in the way that we came out. Our energy and focus were really just not where they needed to be early on, and that didn’t put us in the best position. Our urgency just wasn’t good enough.”
The Terriers controlled several key aspects of the game, winning the groundball battle by a wide 33-23 margin, and controlling the game from the faceoff, securing 16 of the 21 faceoffs to put the Crimson in a tough position.
“We weren’t our best on ground balls,” Wojcik said. “We played poorly at the faceoff, and that made it really difficult to build any momentum after we scored and get possessions.”
Unfortunately for BU, the extra possessions and shots that those efforts earned were not enough to outscore Harvard, thanks in large part to junior goaltender Bryan Moore. Moore was a fiend in net for the Crimson, securing 18 saves and finishing with a stifling 69 percent save percentage, the highest save percentage a Harvard goaltender has recorded since 2013.
“Bryan’s been playing unbelievably lately,” said Harvard captain and junior midfielder Sean Mahon. “He’s an incredible backbone for our defense, and having him back there playing as well as he’s been playing has been huge for us.”
The Crimson’s defense was also able to successfully disrupt the Terrier offense, leading to 15 turnovers, though nine of these were unforced. Sophomore long-stick midfielder Matt Ryan was instrumental in the defensive effort, leading all players in both ground ball pickups and caused turnovers, with six and three respectively.
BU was strong from the outset, jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the first five minutes. Harvard then tightened up, not allowing another goal in the first quarter as Dwyer and freshman attackman Tim Edmonds each notched goals to tie the score up.
The two teams traded goals in the second quarter, as emergent freshman midfielder Joe Lang, Dwyer, and junior attackman Ian Ardrey scored, only to see BU answer each to tie the game up going into halftime.
The third quarter went the same way, as junior attackman Will Walker, Lang, and junior midfielder Walker Kirby notched goals that the Terriers responded to in kind, leading to a tie game at 8-8 going into the fourth quarter.
“We couldn’t really build a lead,” Wojcik said. “We didn’t get faceoffs, and weren’t strong enough on ground balls, and we didn’t really finish all of our shots, and that held us back.”
Defense reigned in the final stretch, as neither team could get past the others’ goaltender through nearly the first 13 minutes of the quarter. Dwyer’s goal, his third of the day and fourth point, was all the Crimson needed to secure the win, coming with 2:05 left in the game. Dwyer leads the team in points so far this season with 42 through the first 11 games.
This game was Harvard’s last non-conference game before closing out the Ivy League season and moving into the playoffs.
“Its always good to win,” Mahon said. “But this game wasn’t our best. We’re hungry to get back out there to practice, put this behind us, and prepare for Penn.”

Harvard Square boasts a variety of shops– from an Urban Outfitters to the only Curious George store in existence. And if it wasn’t enough, not one but two CVSs. While the one at JFK Street is slated to close, the historical landmark next to the Bank of America now faces competition from its new brother located next to the T stop Starbucks. Flyby has investigated the new establishment to inform you about the new, the good, and the bad about this new CVS.
The NewSpace: No longer do you have to feel like you are stuck in the stacks of Widener when you enter a CVS. There is ample for space for you and your horde of famished friends to grab whatever snack or drink pleases your eye. Feel free to frolic through the aisles at whatever time you want while stocking for your next all-nighter.
The View: Tired of the view from the second floor of the Starbucks? Come right to the second story level of the new CVS! Grab yourself a chair from the pharmacy waiting line and place it right by the window and boom you’ve just found yourself a new study spot. As long as nobody complains, you ought to be just fine.
Supplies, supplies, supplies: After a while, getting your everyday student needs at the Coop or Staples can get a bit heavy on your budget. Fear not student, the new CVS has everything you desire. From a wide assortment of pens and highlighters and random office supplies, the new CVS has you covered.
The GoodLocation: Gone are the days where you needed to wait for that darn traffic light on Mass. Ave. to get to your original CVS. It’s dangerous to cross the streets– the new CVS not only supplies you with your everyday needs but values your safety, talk about commitment.
The BadR.I.P Self-checkouts: The fatal flaw of the new CVS is the absence of the self-checkout. I like going at my own pace and hearing the lovely automatic voice speak to me gently in English (and Spanish as well). The feeling of placing my purchased material in the plastic bags grants me an ephemeral satisfaction of maturity and responsibility that I can’t get in college. Please CVS, bring it back!
It’s been a good ride, old CVS. You will always have a special place in my heart, especially with the ways you allowed me to pack my own bags, but alas we must move on. It’s not you, it’s me...and also everything that is new and good about the new CVS.
