After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lock clicked from down the hall, signaling to Jude that it was Monday and his girlfriend was back from her trip. He’d been sky-high on edibles for the past four days and once again destroyed the place in the process. He cursed himself silently for not setting an alarm or something, knowing how hard it was to keep track of time when she wasn’t around.
He tried to sweep the ashes off the countertop in front of him, but the moisture from his hands turned it into a terrible smear. Fate told him it was too late to put in last-ditch efforts, so he just turned off the TV and sat there. When Julie stepped in, the only sound was her keys jangling between her fingers. She closed her eyes, the smell of funky man-BO mixed with cannabis hitting her, and let her duffel hit the floor. “Jude. You’ve gotta be fricken kidding me.” Her eyes were still closed, but she was vibrating with rage and frustration. Jude could see it. It was very familiar.
I went to the corner, behind two empty takeout bags and next to the laundry basket, and covered my ears and face and body while she screamed at him. All the words piercing through his skin and bones. And Jude sat, defenseless in the shame of knowing that every word was true. Plus, he was still sky high.
Every two weeks, like literal clock work, Julie went home to see her family and take her dad to his chemo appointments. Jude remained and lived alone in their shared apartment for four to five days, sometimes a week. And the place would inevitably become a den of disgustingness and Jude would be outrageously zooted. Then Julie would come back, emotionally and physically exhausted from her trip, and scream through the anger and the pain and the frustration that her boyfriend didn’t respect her enough to not destroy their home. And Jude would mutter apologies, as he started picking up the trash and she would join in until the place was clean and they both collapsed with exhaustion.
I’d hide until they were done. It was so scary. She was scary. She reminded me of mom. When we used to sleep with the lights on and run the electricity bill into the thousands. Mom used to go ballistic. But the night lights she bought did nothing to fend off the shadows dancing through the room. So, every night, we had no choice but to turn on our lamp and the hallway ones too. Even though, at the end of the day, she was right and the shadows never did anything to harm us. Not even when the power went out and there was nothing but darkness all around.
And Jude, that jerk, he would just up and leave me during all of this. Each and every time. I don’t know when he learned it, how to dissociate so cleanly from his body, just leaving me here with the consequences. So, I learned how to hide. And our body would sit there or clean or do whatever, all while being shredded by their words. It was horrifying to watch. I was horrified.
Jude went many different places when he left. It wasn’t some prescribed “happy place,” like people talk about. Sometimes he went to this cathedral-like place (in his head), and roamed about and looked at the pretty art and architecture. Sometimes he pretended he was a hero or celebrity, saving the day and basking in the glory. One time he imagined he and Julie won the lottery and moved to Spain and laid in the sun all day. He was in Spain now, shopping for fresh produce for dinner. (He was a little hungry, back in real life.)
I hated that he left me like that, every week, scurrying from behind furniture and under sheets. All while he was on vacation. Hiding was hard work too, because all the best spots were being cleaned. When he was here, though, Jude was a pretty great guy. We’d have so much fun together when he was high and giggly. Sometimes Julie would smoke too and I’d watch their years of wear and tear slip away, until it was just us in our plain and natural form. And we’d play games and draw and reminisce and just be. They both had a lot of trouble just being, in my opinion. Julie was always trying to be a perfect medical student and a perfect daughter, and Jude was always trying to escape.
Now, they were done cleaning and Jude was done apologizing. He had come back to his body and held Julie, as her anger subsided and her sadness about her dad resurfaced, until she fell asleep. And by that time, Jude was sober and wishing he had fallen asleep with her, so he didn’t have to sit in the consciousness that his life — the real one — was spinning out of control.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taylor Swift sits at the top of two lists: most-streamed artist on Spotify in a day and most carbon emissions by a private jet. Only one of those was expected.
In July, Kylie Jenner posted a picture on Instagram that sparked the latest wave of anger at the Kardashians. She and Travis Scott were posed in front of their private jets with the simple caption: “you wanna take mine or yours?”
The comments were flooded with angry fans and Instagramers.
“creeps like you Killin the earth”
“gurl what about NEITHER!!!”
This online chatter led to the circulation of an article listing the ten celebrities with the worst private jet emissions. With over 8,250 tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted from her private jet this year, nearly 1,200 times more than the average person’s total annual emissions, pop princess Taylor Swift was given the crown of number one polluter. That doesn’t feel very America’s Sweetheart to me — and it didn’t to her PR team either, who quickly released a statement claiming that the emissions came from Taylor lending her jets to other celebrities (as if that really makes it better).
Accompanying Taylor on this top ten list are Floyd Mayweather, Jay-Z, A-Rod, Blake Shelton, Steven Spielberg, Kim Kardashian, Mark Wahlberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Travis Scott.
At this point in the climate movement, many of us are aware that the real polluters are companies, not the average college student. But suspended somewhere between us and billion-dollar corporations are the multi-millionaire celebrities. Although not as rich as Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, they are far from normal and even farther from innocent.
While we, as current students or recent graduates, may try to reduce our carbon footprint by taking one fewer flight a year, celebrities take 10-minute flights when they could easily drive. Despite these uneven contributions to the climate crisis, the blame is put on the everyday person.
Yes, we should buy less. Yes, we should eat more plant-based foods. And yes, there are a million other things the average person should be doing to reduce their carbon footprint.
But at the same time, companies shouldn’t continue to produce products they know will end up in landfills. Elected officials should implement policies that will encourage behavioral change. Celebrities should stop taking 10-minute flights.
This misattributed blame for the climate crisis has resulted in a blatant double standard that even activists continue to participate in. While sharing lunch with a group of community organizers, I asked for a straw and was looked at like I’d grown a second head or committed the worst crime on the planet.
So I write this as an acknowledgment of the frustration many of us have with the movement. It’s difficult to keep your own morale high and commit to the lifestyle changes that climate action requires when we see others undermining that work.
And even when you do persevere through it, you never seem to be doing enough — despite countless individuals emitting thousands of times more carbon than you. I don’t have the solution to these feelings of defeat or hopelessness, but there are three things I like to remind myself of that do help.
First, I’m not alone in feeling this way. The majority of young people struggle with some form of climate-related anxiety. Second, we’ve made a lot of progress in combating this global crisis. Countries around the world have scaled back fossil fuel usage and renewable energy has become much more affordable.
Third, there are things we can control. We can directly impact our own behaviors and communities: families, schools, workplaces, elected officials, and neighborhoods. Whether through voting, participating in local initiatives, or adopting small lifestyle changes, there are steps we can take that add up and help us regain a sense of agency in a crisis that thrives on our complacency.

On the very eve of the Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College trial, we asked our Editorial editors to reflect on what affirmative action means to them, and the impact that the initiative’s downfall could have on Harvard.
As a child, I was fascinated by the Supreme Court. An institution that bore witness to our nation’s history. An institution that shaped our nation’s history. An institution that changed the course of our nation’s history. An institution that will now also revise history. Any suggestion that our nation has moved past the need to be race-conscious, in college admissions or elsewhere, are deeply misaligned with reality. SCOTUS may rule on law, but it cannot manifest falsehoods into truths. Race-consciousness is not yet history — but a Court worthy of respect will be.
—Ruby Huang ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a History concentrator in Leverett House.
The U.S. admissions process as it currently stands is an attempt to traverse through a student's story, their life as they see fit to share. To erase race from that story is a grave mistake. For myself, Harvard always seemed completely out of reach, an actual "dream" school, but race-concious admissions gave me enough comfort to share a fuller picture of my story and identity. Race-conscious admissions is hope; I don't know if I would ever have had the chance to immerse myself in my ambitions, to come to the realization that I too am able to excel in my “dream” college if provided the right opportunity and resources, without that hope.
—Labiba Uddin ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Pforzheimer House.
I have nothing but love for my Asian American siblings. I glow when I meet peers who share my same fumbled grasp of Mandarin and taste for black sesame paste. I do not think we are lacking in personality. But I hate more how Students for Fair Admissions has pitted us against Black and Brown communities in their aim to dismantle affirmative action. We are not enemies. We are all victims under the overarching admissions system that accepts a majority of white applicants year after year, splitting slivers between people of color.
—Christina M. Xiao ’24, an Associate Editorial Editor, is a joint concentrator in Computer Science and Government in Eliot House. 
I find that to be in a Harvard classroom — a diverse Harvard classroom — is to be in ambitious, creative, inclusive company. While affirmative action is not a perfect solution, it’s fostered the Harvard classrooms I’ve grown to love. A Harvard without it means a Harvard with fewer perspectives to learn from, fewer similar voices to relate with and lean on, fewer opportunities for social mobility. Throwing away an imperfect solution does not throw away the problem, and for a problem as big as social inequality, peeling back affirmative action’s bandaid will uncover a deep, unhealed wound.
—Emily N. Dial ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Philosophy concentrator in Adams House.
Many of my Harvard peers often reflect upon how they had never been exposed to such a diverse community prior to college. I count myself lucky to say that after growing up in my hometown I simply can’t relate. Prior to freshmen year, I had never witnessed such intense representation of rich white kids. Without Affirmative Action, a greater share of future Harvard students will be in my shoes. And scarier even is that they might not be bothered by it.
—Haley A. Lifrieri ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Computer Science concentrator in Winthrop House
A campus without affirmative action is one that hinders a genuine commitment to true education, philosophy, and social betterment. We need unique voices and experiences in Harvard classrooms to prepare the citizen leaders of the world that will show empathy, understanding, and tolerance to the multitude of identities that exist. A student’s racial identity should not have to be hidden or suppressed on their college applications. Instead, diverse experiences should be the fuel to a well-rounded, nuanced education.
—Ebony M. Smith ’24, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Government and African-American Studies joint concentrator in Eliot House.


We all belong here. No matter how we got here, we deserve our place at Harvard. ‘We’ encompasses all the people who inhabit this institution, no matter their personal identities. This diversity in ‘we,’ foundational to humanity’s strength, is facing a potentially fatal blow by society’s most privileged. No matter the outcome of this case, I hope the movement for more racial equality and diversity in our educational, professional, and personal spaces will continue to push forward. Diversity is the engine of progress. I fear that we may have forgotten that.
—Hea Pushpraj ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Straus Hall.
One of the main questions to grapple with during this case is at what point in time race-conscious admissions policies will have completed their task. When can we trust admissions processes are offering Black applicants a fair shot? Who knows. Right now — on a campus where Generational African American numbers are already particularly low — affirmative action is necessary. A negative future, where affirmative action ends abruptly, is one where our campuses de-diversify and American educational attainment diminishes. A positive future, where there is no longer any need for affirmative action because systemic racism has vanished, must be earned.
—Sterling Bland ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a joint concentrator in Sociology and African American Studies in Quincy House.
The end of affirmative action will be an opportunity for Harvard to begin promoting socioeconomic diversity, a factor that plays a much more significant role in admissions criteria like the SAT than differences in race. Yet, parental income does not entirely explain test outcomes: racial disparities still play a tragic role. Affirmative action is ending before its purpose has been realized.
—Jacob M. Miller ’25 is a Crimson Editorial editor in Lowell House.
In the Report on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery, the University pledged to move from “recommendations to action” in rectifying the institution’s direct ties to slavery and complicity in the historical subjugation of Black people. From the moment of the report’s release, I was dubious that the $100 million set aside would produce significant change. Without affirmative action, I am terrified. Harvard’s intentions to reckon with its dark history — a history that includes enslaved children who labored in Harvard Hall and donors who derived their wealth from the exploitation of enslaved people on Caribbean sugar plantations — necessarily require it to be intentional about ensuring that it opens its gates to a diverse group of students for whom this institution was not founded.
—Ericka S. Familia ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, is a Social Studies concentrator in Adams House. 
I am disappointed — not only because affirmative action will likely come to an end in the very near future, but also due to the fact that I am unsurprised. This decision would support a disheartening trend of SCOTUS social regression which stands to negatively impact millions. Affirmative action is necessary in promoting diversity and equity, and essential in raising the voices of underrepresented populations. This likely decision begs the question: Will future attempts to ensure admissions diversity post-affirmative action come close to being enough? With a skeptical and heavy heart, all I can say is that I hope so.
—Gracia A. Perala ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Straus Hall.
My single happiest point on this board across the years has been the evolution of the board itself — its shifts to become more inclusive, more willing to defy precedent, and, particularly, more diverse in every sense. I fear what the fall of affirmative action will do to The Crimson (both at the Editorial Board and writ large) and other organizations that have only recently begun to display and benefit from the vast array of perspectives our campus and society have to offer. The next few years will be ones of bleeding — bleeding talent, bleeding faces, bleeding opportunity. Campus spaces will progressively become more homogenous, every graduating class passing the torch to marginally less representative one. Spaces (social, professional, extracurricular) with budding diversity will wither, dry and revert to their older forms; their products (networks, newspapers, events) will reflect that drought. It's highly likely that, by the time I leave next year, this very board will be on a slow but steady track to become more monochromatic than it has been in years. That makes me deeply sad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Monday came as a preface — a glimpse into the undoing of decades’ worth of progress and effort, into the undoing of entire communities and the further marginalization of the historically hurt. A teaser for a new, darker future in American higher education.
Race-conscious admissions, the pillar upon which our flourishing, diverse campus was built, had what might be its swan song.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the affirmative action cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The plaintiff in both cases, Students for Fair Admission, led by conservative legal strategist (and not-a-lawyer) Edward J. Blum, is suing Harvard and UNC for their race-conscious admissions policies in attempts to overturn nearly 40 years of precedent institutionalizing affirmative action in the United States.
If SFFA wins – and given the court’s increasingly reliable and irresponsible conservative majority, it probably will – Harvard’s efforts to create a racially-diverse student body will quickly unravel.
The College’s mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders of our society demands a genuine and dedicated commitment to fostering a diverse campus. A campus without diversity cannot accurately reflect current American or global communities; a school that fails to reflect its surrounding society cannot simultaneously expect to lead it. Without eclectic perspectives that stem from a diversity of experiences, academic discussions will fall victim to the tyranny of theory, flattening subjects such as African and African American Studies into imagined problems at the service of abstract intellectual explorations. The study of ethnic studies is not an arbitrary academic exercise, and nor should students of color and their lived experiences be dehumanized and commodified for the sake of educational enrichment.
The effects of a less diverse campus will linger well after graduation. A Harvard education is nothing if not a door opener. Our freshly minted degrees are a priceless asset in the eyes of many employers and graduate schools, with many prioritizing candidates from Harvard and similar institutions during recruitment. In other words, being on Harvard’s campus affords disadvantaged students not only a wealth of educational resources but also a path to (professionally and financially) brighter futures as well. Making Harvard less diverse will have socioeconomic ramifications writ large, reinforcing and exacerbating preexisting racial inequities.
At its core, the elimination of affirmative action suggests that we as a nation have moved past the need for race consciousness — that we have, within two years of the death of George Floyd, in a state with heavily segregated public schools, vanquished racial inequity in education and thus affirmative action is no longer necessary. That the individuals we entrust with the lifetime power to uphold our laws and constitutional order could show such profound ignorance of our country’s history and present, that they could parrot rhetoric so separate from our social realities, is beyond disturbing.
We shouldn’t have to point out the aggressively self-evident living legacy of racism in this nation, any more than we should have to explain the myriad of ways in which it will only be worsened by ending affirmative action.
Affirmative action, although imperfect, can challenge our tendency toward racial prejudice. Yet tragically, as a result of said social tendencies toward racial prejudice, it may sow strong feelings of doubt in those that benefit from the practice. Even if affirmative action remains, Black, Latine, and Indigenous people may still doubt their place at institutions such as Harvard, whether they earned their place or were simply accepted to make a larger argument with no regard to their individual experiences and futures. But without affirmative action, they may not even have the opportunity to ask that question.
Diversity, frequently lauded as one of the core benefits of affirmative action, is not just important from a pedagogical perspective. It creates safe spaces for students of color, providing them with the necessary affirmation and celebration of their existence and right to belong at elite and historically exclusionary institutions such as Harvard. For Generational African-Americans, who have been estimated at only 10 percent of the Black population at Harvard, the need for supportive communities is especially dire given the nation’s long history of oppression and disenfranchisement. The ending of affirmative action, as such, poses a great threat to these essential, underserved communities and may sharply decrease the already low representation of them on campus.
These communities mustn’t be ravaged without a fight. For that, we commend the students who have sacrificed their time to organize rallies and traveled to Washington D.C. to fight for our campus and peers. On Harvard’s campus and beyond, we appreciate the efforts of those initiating echo rallies and encourage our faculty members to be accommodating of students at this time.
Finally, to all our peers from underrepresented backgrounds, and to all of those for which these highly abstract legal debates feel painfully tangible: You undoubtedly belong here. Not just as an admissions story, not just as a nice statistic for our college, but as multifaceted individuals deserving of growth and community. It’s tempting, at times like these, to compare oneself to students who have come from immense wealth and privilege — those who have taken easier paths like the Z-list and legacy admissions — and feel defeated.
But our campus is made so much better by your presence here. Of that, if nothing else, we have unyielding certainty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a Harvard student, I recognize that I’m only here because the College has grown more diverse. The institution that primarily served wealthy, white, male Boston Brahmins in the 19th century has today opened its doors to people of all classes, races, genders, sexualities, nationalities, religions, and more. Seeing the diversity amongst my classmates gives me pride while walking through campus.
All college campuses and workplaces should strive for diversity: Diverse perspectives, stemming from diverse experiences, enrich our conversations and work.
However, as it currently stands, affirmative action centered around race seems too blunt a mechanism to completely and respectfully consider the unique backgrounds and resources of individual applicants. For example, an analysis found that Asian Americans consistently receive lower personality ratings than all other racial groups. This dispreference disregards the heterogeneity present in the Asian American community, which encapsulates vast multicultural and multiethnic backgrounds stretching across the world’s largest continent, as well as the greatest income inequality amongst racial groups in the United States.
This overlooking of economic background for the more general consideration of race is not unique to Asian American applicants. The tips given by our race-conscious affirmative action system seem to primarily benefit well-off minorities, with 71 percent of Black and Hispanic students at Harvard coming from college-educated homes with incomes above the national median.
I don’t contest the existence of structural racism in the United States. However, social science research suggests that it is economic segregation, not racial, that explains the achievement gap between schools. It is in fact a result of structural racism that race and class are so tightly confounded.
Socioeconomic diversity should be prioritized in college admissions because it can directly ground evaluations of merit, in considering an applicant’s achievements given the resources available to them. A Black student who grew up in the South Side of Chicago with an underfunded public education system will have a drastically different experience and capacity for achievement than a Black student who went to one of the top private schools in Hawaii.
Due to the relationship between race and economic status, this new income-based, race-neutral affirmative action system would still achieve significant racial diversity — while also eliminating extreme cases of unfair evaluation, such as a low-income Asian American or white applicant being penalized for not achieving as much as a wealthy underrepresented minority applicant. Ultimately, such a conceptualization of merit would allow Harvard to identify students who have outperformed despite limiting resources, an incredibly difficult and impressive endeavor, and to provide these students with significant resources to unlock their full potential.
Given this conception of merit, it is indefensible for legacy applicants to receive preferential treatment. These applicants, as the children of statistically high-earning Harvard graduates, already have massive advantages in the college admissions process, even before their legacy status is factored in. It is an open secret that Harvard gives preferential treatment towards applicants from families that have donated or will donate to Harvard, which Harvard may think is more likely for alumni. Legacies make up nearly half of the infamous backdoor acceptance Z-list. Their parents may have the funds to bribe officials at elite colleges to admit their children, such as in the Varsity Blues scandal. Clearly, these legacy applicants do not stand on an equal playing field with their peers, because of class advantages passed down from their parents.
Continuing to admit legacy applicants is one way in which Harvard’s admissions process has failed to cultivate socioeconomic diversity on campus. Low-income students regularly report feelings of alienation from their wealthier counterparts, as friendships often cleave along class lines. These lacking cross-class friendships could greatly boost socioeconomic mobility for low-income students.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Our neighboring institution MIT does not consider legacy status in its admissions, and — unsurprisingly — exhibits more socioeconomic diversity and increased socioeconomic mobility compared to Harvard. Furthermore, MIT alumni donate more money and more frequently, on average, compared to Harvard alumni. It is entirely possible for Harvard to stop legacy admissions, with no negative repercussions to donations.
Removing legacy admissions would be the first step for Harvard in the necessary pursuit of socioeconomic diversity and merit as defined in the context of applicants’ resources. Finally, Harvard’s affirmative action system could align with American public opinion on the system, as well as social science research findings on the comparatively higher obstacles resulting from class than from race. Racial divisions invoked by arguments from Students for Fair Admissions can start to heal, as all economically disadvantaged peoples see that they are given due opportunity.
As Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, “It is a simple matter of justice that America, in dealing creatively with the task of raising the Negro from backwardness, should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor.” I strive to live in an America where one may be born economically disadvantaged but ascend the socioeconomic ladder due to equal opportunity. After all, that’s what the American dream is all about. Harvard can engineer this dream, for the thousands of applicants it admits per year, by prioritizing socioeconomic diversity — and it all starts with ending legacy admissions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Halloween seemed to feature more tricks than treats: On October 31st, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on affirmative action lawsuits brought by Students for Fair Admissions against Harvard and the University of North Carolina. It felt like the beginning of the end — a death knell for Harvard, and for higher education more broadly, as we know it.
Facing the likely end of race-conscious admissions, we cannot stress enough the importance of such policies in shaping Harvard’s campus — one we cherish as a socially and intellectually vibrant community, enlivened by connections that span every dimension of culture, experience, history, and identity. But beyond the significance of diversity on a college campus, and given the long and ugly history of racial oppression in the United States, institutional commitments to racial equity are also integral to our conception of a just society. If the court refuses to recognize the importance of race-conscious college admissions, it will set the nation down a dangerous path.
After centuries of racially unequal treatment, in a farcical twist, the U.S. is poised to mobilize the de jure equality of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment against the de facto equality of Black people — the work of a court majority that stands for justice in name but not in spirit. This uncautious longing for color blindness continues a troubling threat found decades ago in the Grutter v. Bollinger decision, which famously proclaimed that affirmative action would no longer be necessary after 25 years, laughably supplanting any serious assessment of material conditions of racial equity with what amounts to the prophesying of majority-white jurists.
Even on narrowly originalist grounds, the court’s majority dispenses too readily with the persuasive argument that the 14th Amendment was not made to be color-blind. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 related in the context of another case, the 14th Amendment is a Reconstruction Amendment, passed in response to the end of an explicitly racial system of subjugation and meant to sweep the vestiges of that system into the annals of history. To borrow from Justice Jackson: “That’s not a race-neutral or race-blind idea.”
But since the 14th Amendment seems unlikely to stop a court that has already proven a tendency to deviate from precedent in egregious ways, Harvard has to respond decisively. This is the challenge of a generation for our university — the kind that will define its character for decades. Nothing will fill the vacuum left behind by the collapse of race-conscious admissions, but that’s no excuse for policy-void resignation; our institution cannot allow its next chapter to be written in monochromatic ink. The collapse of affirmative action must be met with righteous anger and a renewed commitment to diversity — not with an empty, subdued shrug.
We call on Harvard, for the sake of its students and veritas alike, to meet the moment with all the resources at its disposal.
First, we implore Harvard to initiate a bottom-up rethink of its admissions process — one aimed at developing new ways to preserve its racial and ethnic diversity. The University should work with its world-class scholars in African American Studies, Economics, Sociology, Statistics, and beyond to develop a new range of admissions metrics able to achieve diversity of all kinds in its freshman class (Raj Chetty comes to mind). Racial affirmative action is necessary because Black people face unique challenges across countless dimensions of American life. Surely Harvard can find novel, intelligent ways to quantify this reality for assessment in the admissions process.
Even as broader race-conscious admissions come under fire, Harvard should consider taking a narrower, lineage-based approach by accounting for those with direct descent from enslaved Americans. Such a proposal, supported by scholars like Nikole Hannah-Jones, would expand the population of generationally African-American students at Harvard — a group whose vast underrepresentation on our campus is concerning not least due to Harvard’s still-emerging history of deep ties to American slavery.
The University’s rethink must also occur at a broader level: Even as it has gradually, begrudgingly diversified across some dimensions, at no point since its inception has our University been economically diverse. No matter how many times we repeat them, the numbers continue to shock us: Nearly 15 times as many of our classmates come from the top 20 percent of the income distribution (67 percent) as the bottom 20 percent (4.5 percent); just 1.8 percent of Harvard students start life poor and end it rich.
It is a sad irony that a school hallowed for its transformative, world-changing potential hardly ever transforms the material conditions of its students — all because of who is able to make it through the front door. For decades, elite schools have been bastions of generational wealth and elite power. Now, the impending end of affirmative action threatens to put the racial character of this power differential in stark terms.
Consider various metrics for the concentration of poverty. Owing to America’s history of racial oppression, one analysis found that 16 percent of Black people live in high-poverty areas versus just 4 percent of white people. Another informative metric is secondary school quality: Because local property taxes substantially fund American public schools, areas of concentrated poverty are also often areas without access to high-quality public education. Unsurprisingly, these tend also to be disproportionately Black areas — the ongoing effects of residential segregation mean that poor Black children are about  30 percent more likely to attend high-poverty schools than their poor white peers.
Post-affirmative action, Harvard must rethink more than just the evaluative phase of its admissions process. It is high time for the College to think about who applies in the first place — to double down on efforts to recruit applicants from marginalized backgrounds. Studies show that a majority of low-income students “undermatch,” or attend a college less selective than their qualifications would likely allow, with much of this effect seemingly resulting from limited information about what these schools are like and how to best apply. Relatively low-cost information-based interventions like help with filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid can have substantial impacts on college outcomes.
It is also insufficient to simply admit a diverse class without being prepared to support them. As we wait for the drop of the gavel, the College must prepare for the sharp increase in socioeconomic diversity that alternatives to racial affirmative action will likely occasion. Should these alternatives to race-conscious admissions be implemented as we hope, the Harvard of five years from now may feature many more students from under-resourced schools than at any point in its history. Accordingly, the University must be ready to engage in the careful, evidence-driven planning and massive resource commitments that may be necessary to ensure that students from all backgrounds are equally able to avail themselves of the opportunities promised by a Harvard education.
Our community is beautiful, technicolor-brilliant — our hearts ache at the thought that it might fade before our eyes. Firmly convinced of the value of diversity, we hold that there is no price too great to pay to stop this regression. Harvard should and must be willing to marshall all its experts, explore every conceivable metric, consider any possible program, and, at last, come face-to-face with the economic injustice it has always tolerated.
Harvard has a choice. It can be racially and economically diverse. Or it can be neither.

Editor’s note: The following pictures of Harvard undergraduate students were all taken in the weeks leading up to the Supreme Court oral arguments in the Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard College trial, which is broadly seen as likely to weaken or dismantle race-conscious admissions policies if not affirmative action altogether. The images, along with the musings of the students pictured, are meant to freeze in time a fraction of our campus as it was before the tide began to shift.

Editorial Chair Guillermo S. Hava helped curate the picture selection and edited the quotes for length and clarity. 
“While affirmative action policies played a part in the admission of students of color being here, the truth is our academic talents and extracurricular pursuits solidified our rightful place in this class – and those talents speak for themselves. Many of us struggled to get here. There is nothing preferential about our experiences to get to Harvard. And we’re still struggling to keep our place. We all deserve a level playing field of opportunity.”
“Affirmative action is fair admissions, and the justices should see that and the research, facts, and testimonies that back that. Affirmative action admits are proud that these policies aknowledge and pay respect to our struggles in an unjust system, and race-blind socioeconomic alternatives will never be adequate enough to properly explain our worth and potential”
“Race should never be seen as a credential for why someone should be at an institution like Harvard. Everyone who comes to Harvard should deserve to be here, but I don’t think Affirmative Action implies that people are coming here that aren’t getting in on the basis of their talent. Being at Harvard would not be the same were it not for the diverse and unique perspectives brought forth by underrepresented groups. It seems to me that SCOTUS believes educational diversity can be achieved without directly taking account of race, but that’s just untrue.”
“White supremacy continues to wield the model minority myth as a tool to divide people of color. In portraying affirmative action as a zero-sum game between Asian Americans and other minorities, Students for Fair Admissions is, once again, using Asian Americans to invalidate the struggles of other people of color. As Asian Americans, we must speak out against these narratives and call on our communities to do the same.
Although 69 percent of Asian Americans support affirmative action, I want to address the concerns of those who disagree. Here’s what SFFA won’t tell you: The effect of Asian American ethnicity on an applicant’s likelihood of admission is statistically indistinguishable from zero. There is actually a positive correlation between being an Asian American woman and an applicant’s likelihood of admission. And if the Court outlaws affirmative action, the group that gains the most representation would not be Asian Americans. The number of white students at Harvard would increase by three times the number that Asian American students would. The notion that affirmative action discriminates against Asian applicants is a malicious myth, and its abolition would only hurt disadvantaged Asian Americans.”
“No racial or ethnic groups have a monopoly on talent or intelligence, but some students have a monopoly on affirmative action, and race-conscious policy accounts for that discrepancy. This isn’t just Harvard, it is universities around the country, this can have an incalculable impact, so we have to fight against white supremacy, we have to fight for solidarity.
I as an Asian American refuse to be used as a ploy for white supremacy.”
KB: “I am worried for the generations after us. I have heard enough apologies from folks before us, and I dread the day that we will be apologizing to the next generation about the conditions they are forced to grapple with. As Harvard students, we are bound together by more commonalities than differences. If we can unite to show the world that we unequivocally support each other and the values of diversity and opportunity, we will win regardless of the outcome of this challenge. We cannot fall into a racial conflict fueled by myths. Harvard students must reflect on what our campus community means to themselves. The path forward lies in this reckoning and the incessant conversations which result from it.”

KY: For decades, the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed race-conscious admissions in higher education. After arriving at Harvard from my mid-size east Texas town, I found community in so many diverse spaces on campus. It’s terrifying to think that this could disappear. This attack on affirmative action is rooted in white supremacy and has dangerously painted Asian Americans as a monolith, creating division. Now, I’m reclaiming my identity and using it to unify.
“Admissions based on merit has never and will never lead to a classroom full of diverse thought and experience. Affirmative Action is what makes me excited to go to my class sections because it’s allowed for people of different backgrounds to hold space in a historically white, rich school. So I personally think we still have so much more to do in order to further diversify Harvard. Also, as a person being able to overcome racial and socioeconomic barriers to get to the point where they can aspire to attend a school like this shows more merit to me than bubbling some answers on the SAT.”
BHH: “Affirmative action is super necessary given this institution’s history of explicitly denying entrance to students of color. But beyond historical injustices, the present system of determining an applicant’s worth relies heavily on instruments and institutions created in and for a white supremacist culture. Not only do we limit our cultural diversity in educational spaces, but we greatly inhibit our ability to know the truth in any subject matter when many perspectives are not readily present as the hegemonic one (which again is only here, and hegemonic, due to centuries of imperialism, slavery, colonialism, racism, and genocide, yet despite all the obvious delegitimizing factors, the whites are still making admissions decisions and make up the vast majority of the faculty.
Veritas is impossible in a place like this.”

Meghan M. Garrity, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, discussed her research on government-sanctioned mass expulsion events at a virtual Belfer Center seminar Thursday.
Roughly 25 people attended the talk, entitled “Disorderly and Inhumane: Explaining Government-Sponsored Mass Expulsion, 1900–2020.” During the seminar, Garrity discussed factors that contribute to mass population exchanges and presented the case studies of Uganda — which experienced a mass expulsion event — and Kenya, which did not.
Garrity identified three elements that constrain or enable state-sponsored mass expulsion: domestic and transnational alliances, a government’s relationship to the home country of a targeted group, and the involvement of international organizations like the United Nations.
“Now, none of these factors on its own is enough to enable or constrain expulsion, but the more that are in place, the more likely that it becomes,” Garrity said.
Garrity focused on the case studies of Kenya and Uganda, where there were similar conditions that may have led to expulsion events, but different outcomes occurred. Asians arrived to Kenya and Uganda when they were part of the British Empires. Though there were tensions in both countries, only Uganda’s government expelled the country’s Asian population, while Kenya did not adopt an expulsion policy.
Under Garrity’s framework, political and economic relationships with international allies are influential in a government’s decision to expel a population. Kenya’s reliance on other nations including the United Kingdom both financially and militarily may be one reason why its government did not expel its Asian population, Garrity said.
“An Asian expulsion would have harmed Kenya’s transnational alliances by jeopardizing investor confidence, hindering economic growth, and risking key military and intelligence support,” she said.
A key distinction between the countries was the transition from British colonial rule, which was peaceful for Uganda but violent for Kenya.
“Given this experience, one may have expected the Kenyan government to retaliate both against the British colonizers and the privileged Asian minorities, but they didn’t,” Garrity said.
In an interview after the event, Garrity, who worked in humanitarian aid and development for a decade prior to joining HKS’ International Security program, said she uses datasets to guide her research. She previously published a dataset documenting 139 mass expulsion events over the last century.
Garrity said her interests lie in exploring how governments treat ethnic minorities in cases not as extreme as genocide but that “are certainly also atrocities in their own right.”
“That was the impetus behind developing the dataset and then pursuing additional research on mass expulsion,” she said.
Garrity said she hopes her work helps researchers better understand mass expulsion events in order to drive more effective policy responses.
“Something that I’m trying to do with my work is to bring what I’ve been able to glean from having the luxury of time to really get in the weeds on these issues, and try to figure out how to translate that into effective and sustained policy recommendations for the people who are facing these issues,” Garrity said.
According to Garrity, governments should always “back away from” suggesting mass removals or negotiated international exchanges of populations.
“We should abandon that as a policy recommendation in all cases,” she said.
Correction: November 14, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the period in which Asians migrated to Kenya and Uganda.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Planning and Development Agency discussed the construction of a life science campus along 155 North Beacon St. with Allston-Brighton residents and the Impact Advisory Group during a Tuesday webinar.
The planned redevelopment of North Beacon Street consists of constructing a life science campus with three buildings, including affordable rehearsal space for musicians as well as publicly accessible green space. The project will also realign Life Street and add pedestrian and bicyclist safety measures.
The project site measures 3.1 acres, with the three multi-story life science buildings cumulatively offering about 380,000 square feet of floor space.
During the webinar, James Blount — the project architect — emphasized that the color palettes, materials, and heights of the new buildings will correspond with the pre-existing properties along Beacon Street in order to preserve the “scale and character” of the area.
While the proposed buildings will house a “significant amount of life science space,” they will also offer space for Allston-Brighton residents, according to Blount.
The lobbies of the life science buildings are also intended to host artistic displays, frequent community events, and public restrooms.
Notably, the project contains roughly 27,000 square feet of publicly accessible green space. In designing the space, landscape architect Jay Emperor said he aimed to create a park evoking “playfulness,” “exploration,” and “discovery.”
A spiral, granite seawall will stand at the park’s center so visitors can partake in numerous activities simultaneously, Emperor added.
Impact Advisory Group members said they supported plans for the campus but hoped it will include public internet access.
“I like the work on the park. I think having internet out there is real important whether it’s through the city or through your building,” IAG member John Bligh said. “I think it makes it more usable.”
Finally, the project on Beacon Street aims to realign Life Street, which currently intersects with North Beacon Street at an “oblique,” “non-standard” angle, said transportation permitting manager Elizabeth Peart.
“One of the first things we heard from the city was, ‘We would really like to see Life Street realigned,’” she said.
In response, the BPDA plans to standardize the angle at which Life Street intersects Beacon Street and “install new equipment and new pavement markings,” Peart said.

Indian author Arundhati Roy, who wrote “The God of Small Things,” spoke about the political and social effects of India’s development in her keynote lecture Thursday at a symposium hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School.
Roy’s remarks kicked off the three-day conference, titled “Science, Technology and the Human Future,” which commemorates the 20th anniversary of HKS’ Program on Science, Technology and Society.
In her speech, Roy recalled the situation in India when she last spoke at Harvard.
“The government at the time, Congress Party-led, had signed away indigenous people’s homelands — protected by the Indian constitution — to mining and infrastructure projects,” she said.
Roy said the mining of Bauxite — a source of aluminum found in the mountains of Bastar — led to destruction of nearby forests and rivers. The forests contained many of India’s forest-dwelling tribes and the headquarters of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), she added. The government conducted a military operation to clear the land in 2009, and the Maoist People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army responded, resulting in a civil war.
“Villages were burned to the ground,” she added. “People were chased into the forest where they lived for months under open skies. Women were especially targeted, raped, and killed.”
Roy highlighted the complicated relationship between science, technology, politics, and justice.
“Can we leave the Bauxite in the mountain?” Roy said. “We have the science and technology to take it out. Do we have the imagination or the vision to leave it in?”
Though India has experienced technological development, she said, it has come at a cost.
“Now as the rivers dry up and the forests disappear, as the water table recedes all over the country, there’s unrest,” she said. “There are protests by people refusing to give up their land and access to their resources, refusing to believe false promises anymore.”
Roy said she thinks conflict will never be resolved in India.
“How do you look for light?” she said. “How do you look for something to hold onto for a while where you catch your breath? For me, that’s all we can do.”
The event also featured an original piano quintet, titled “Machine Dreams,” written by composer and Harvard Law School student Chung Hon Michael Cheng ’19.
“It seemed like an exciting way to combine two strands of my background and identity — STEM and music,” Cheng wrote in the event’s program notes.
Thursday’s programming also featured readings from “The Future Humans Anthology,” a curation of poetry, fiction, and art about the future of humanity. Michael P. Evans ’24, an undergraduate STS fellow and co-editor of the anthology, said the work stemmed from one question.
“It was to imagine a future where something fundamental about the world will be altered, and explore the ways in which that may change how we think about ourselves, each other, and what we value,” he said.

Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 called for a “timeout” on social media during a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday evening.
Baker — who delivered the annual Edwin L. Godkin Lecture — encouraged listeners to increase their offline engagement with those of opposing political viewpoints, citing how social media has exacerbated the country’s partisan divide.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow introduced the governor, praising both Baker’s contributions to the Harvard community and his commitment to public service.
“He has something which we hope every Kennedy school graduate would have, and that’s a hard head and a soft heart,” Bacow said of Baker.
Baker, recalling his time at the College 45 years ago, said he never could have imagined a world with “hundreds of social media networks” and phones that could be used to “access information from any corner of the Earth in real time.”
Baker acknowledged technological advances “can break down barriers to people and information” — which he called a “blessing” — but added that misinformation on social media can “drive people apart.”
Algorithms built into social media users’ feeds, Baker said, “dramatically reduce the likelihood you will ever see or hear a news report about anything that challenges or cuts against your belief system.”
“All this self-selecting news and endless information has been driving the bulwark of the two political parties towards their extremes,” he added.
Baker said he disagreed with how social media is “used by producers and users to create their own versions of the truth” and added that it has become “so aggressive and so combative.”
“Finding people who share your love of gardening is just as easy as finding people who share your love for hate speech,” Baker said.
“One of the underlying messages here is that social media needs a timeout,” he added. “People should just stop engaging.”
Baker said mainstream news outlets also limit engagement with diverse political perspectives and reflect a level of partisan polarization inconsistent with the broader American public.
“Most Americans I believe are less partisan, less bombastic, and less combative than many of the people who are involved in and report on politics and government,” Baker added.
Such biased reporting, according to Baker, has resulted in the “cynicism about politics” shown in recent political polling.
Baker said he predicts increasing polarization will drive people away from the Democratic and Republican parties and up the number of registered independent voters.
Attendees entering the forum were confronted by a small group of protestors holding signs decrying Baker’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and calling the pandemic a “hoax.” Indistinguishable shouts from the protestors outside could be heard periodically throughout the lecture.
“It’s hard to find a time in our nation’s history when we weren’t roiled by a variety of difficult and sometimes ugly public debates — see the guys outside,” Baker said, referencing the protestors.
Baker called for coexistence and willingness to listen among those with contrasting views.
“We all need to spend more time engaging opposing viewpoints, not trying to ban them,” he said.

Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 has raised more money in the race for Massachusetts governor from the ZIP code encompassing Harvard Square than almost any other, raking in more than $89,000 from the area since the start of the year.
Healey, a Democrat who has served as the state’s top law enforcement official since 2015, has opened up a seismic fundraising advantage over her Republican opponent, Geoffrey G. Diehl. She has brought in more than $5 million since the start of the year, according to state campaign finance filings, compared to Diehl’s $1.1 million.
Healey has raised nearly $157,000 from Cambridge residents since the start of the year, according to the most recent available state filings. The majority of the money she has raised in Cambridge comes from the 02138 ZIP code, which includes the heart of Harvard’s campus, along with Fresh Pond and West Cambridge.
Diehl, a former state representative from Plymouth, has raised just over $4,000 from Cambridge since Jan. 1 — a small part of his fundraising haul this year.
Healey’s five top fundraising ZIP codes are all located in the Boston area. She has raised almost $115,000 from the 02116 ZIP code, which covers a portion of the city’s Back Bay — the most of any area in the country.
Diehl’s top fundraising ZIP code is 02169, which covers Quincy, where he has raised more than $19,000.
About 84 percent of Healey’s money comes from Massachusetts residents, compared to 95 percent for Diehl.
Outside of Massachusetts, Healey has brought in the most money from New York, Florida, and Connecticut. Diehl has earned the most from Florida, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.
Healey, a former Harvard basketball player, has brought in at least $36,000 from Harvard employees, according to filings. Among her Harvard-affiliated donors are Law School professors Martha L. Minow and Robert H. Mnookin ’64, Economics professor David M. Cutler ’87, and Radcliffe rowing coach Liz O’Leary.
Diehl has earned at least $1,300 from Harvard employees, including $300 from Government professor Paul E. Peterson.
Healey, who graduated from Northeastern University School of Law, has raised at least $680,000 from lawyers since the start of the year, according to state filings, representing the top occupation among her contributors. She has brought in at least $235,000 from CEOs and $225,000 from consultants.
She has out-raised Diehl among state employees by 37 fold, raking in at least $55,000 compared to his $1,500.
Healey holds a wide polling lead over Diehl, who was not endorsed by the popular outgoing Republican governor, Charlie D. Baker ’79.
Polls will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.

WASHINGTON — Since 1996, eight of the nine seats on the Supreme Court have changed hands. But a constant has remained throughout the 26-year span: Seth P. Waxman ’73 at the lectern.
Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general, has argued before the highest court at least once in 25 of the last 26 years, totaling 84 Supreme Court appearances in the last three decades. In his latest turn before the justices this week, Waxman led the charge to preserve affirmative action in higher education, arguing in defense of Harvard’s race-conscious admissions practices.
Though the court appears poised to strike down affirmative action, legal experts praised Waxman’s performance, commending his ease and confidence before the bench.
Waxman has served on Harvard’s legal team since anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions first sued the school in 2014, alleging that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian American students. The group filed a similar lawsuit against the University of North Carolina, which was also heard by the Supreme Court on Monday.
In contrast to Waxman’s extensive record before the court, both lawyers representing SFFA and North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park, who represented UNC, had only previously argued before the Court once in their careers.
Another new presence in the courtroom was Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 — who began her first term on the court last month. Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case in March, citing her previous position on the University’s Board of Overseers.
For the other eight justices, though, Waxman was a familiar face.
Interactions between the justices and Waxman seemed a “little chummy,” New York University School of Law professor and Supreme Court expert Melissa E. Murray said. “That was not the case for some of the other lawyers.”
In one exchange during the hearing, Waxman continued arguing even as Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. tried to ask a question, prompting Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 to interject.
“Justice Alito would like to ask a question,” Roberts said.
“I’m sorry. I’m not trying to filibuster you,” Waxman replied, laughing.
Alito invited Waxman to finish his argument, a marked contrast from the justices’ interactions with the other lawyers present Monday.
“Even from an outsider perspective, you could pick up on a difference in just the mode of engagement,” said Jonathan Feingold, a professor at the Boston University School of Law.
The former Solicitor General was quick to banter with the justices. When Justice Neil M. Gorsuch posed a hypothetical admissions scenario, Waxman interjected.
“I’m pretty sure, because you’re asking me, I’m not going to like it,” he said.
“You’re not going to like it,” Gorsuch confirmed, prompting a laugh from Justice Amy Coney Barrett.
Murray said that both Waxman and U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, who argued in favor of both Harvard and UNC, seemed to be more at ease before the justices than the other lawyers.
“It was just more fluent, more easy, like more of a conversation as opposed to a battle,” Murray said. “With Prelogar and Waxman, there was a kind of fluency and just facility with the justices — like a comfort that was there.”
University of Michigan Law School professor Leah M. Litman ’06 said that while Waxman’s familiarity with the court helped set a friendly tone throughout the arguments, his evidence-based responses to the justices’ questions granted him more “wiggle room.”
“He says really helpful things,” Litman said. “That is, he is answering questions and pointing out relevant details about the factual record or relevant points about constitutional interpretation that are responsive to the questions and move the Court forward.”
Litman also noticed that Waxman would first outline each response before elaborating, a strategy that let the justices know ahead of time when he would be finished with his reply.
“When he says, ‘I have a two-part or three-part answer’ or ‘I'll answer your question, but then I need to get to something else,’ they allow him to do that,” she said.
But Litman predicted that Waxman’s tactics may not be enough to preserve the future of affirmative action.
“Is that going to make a difference in this case?” Litman asked of Waxman’s performance. “Probably not, just given the extent to which the justices are so strongly committed to overruling Grutter v. Bollinger and ending race-conscious remedies.”

Massachusetts voters will head to the polls Tuesday in the 2022 midterm elections. The races at the top of the ticket remain largely uncompetitive.
Here’s what you need to know going into the Massachusetts midterms.
At the top of the ticket, the race to replace outgoing Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 is widely expected to be a walk in the park for Democrats. Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, who cruised through the Democratic primary in September, leads the Republican nominee, Geoffrey G. Diehl, in most polls. Healey led Diehl, a Trump-backed former state representative from Plymouth, 61 percent to 33 percent in a recent University of Massachusetts Amherst poll.
Healey also holds a commanding fundraising advantage over Diehl, according to recent state campaign finance filings. Baker, the popular outgoing GOP governor who opted not to seek a third term, has notably sat out the race, declining to endorse Diehl.
Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll tops the Democratic ticket alongside Healey as the party’s nominee for lieutenant governor. She faces former State Representative Leah G. Cole Allen. Driscoll, who defeated a pair of Democratic challengers in the primary, also holds a wide lead over Allen, according to the UMass Amherst poll.
In the race for attorney general, former Boston City Councilor Andrea J. Campbell, the Democratic nominee, will face Republican James McMahon, a trial attorney. Campbell holds a commanding 25 percentage point lead over McMahon, according to the UMass poll.
Campbell would be the first Black woman elected to a statewide office in Massachusetts.
Longtime incumbent Secretary of State William F. Galvin, a Democrat who was first elected in 1994, is running for his eighth term. He will face Republican Rayla Campbell, a right-wing radio host.
Galvin defeated a progressive primary challenger, Tanisha Sullivan, who leads the Boston chapter of the NAACP, with 72 percent of the vote in September.
Galvin led Cambell by 28 percentage points in the UMass Amherst poll.
The race for state auditor could be the Republicans’ best chance to put up a fight on Tuesday. Democrat Diana DiZoglio is set to face Republican Anthony Amore, the only GOP nominee Baker has endorsed. The state auditor is responsible for conducting audits of state programs, departments, and agencies.
A recent Suffolk University poll showed DiZoglio, a Massachusetts state senator from Essex, leading Amore, 40 percent to 25 percent. Almost a quarter of voters remained undecided, according to the survey.
U.S. Representatives
All nine Democrats who represent Massachusetts in the U.S. House are considered safe in their re-election campaigns. Representatives Ayanna S. Pressley and Katherine M. Clark, who represent Cambridge, face Republicans Dannie D. Palmer Jr. and Caroline Colarusso respectively.
All eight members of Cambridge’s state legislative delegation — Representatives David M. Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Michael L. Connolly, Steven C. Owens, and Jay D. Livingstone and Senators Lydia M. Edwards, Patricia D. Jehlen, and Sal N. DiDomenico — are running unopposed as Democrats.
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday, including a location at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts voters will decide the fate of a recently passed measure to allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses during Tuesday’s election.
In May, the state legislature passed a law directing the Registry of Motor Vehicles to refrain from soliciting documents proving immigration status, paving the way for undocumented immigrants to become licensed drivers. The following month, Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 vetoed the measure, but he was overridden by Democrats in the state legislature.
In response to the law’s survival, newly formed Fair and Secure Massachusetts collected the necessary signatures to put the law up for referendum. If passed, Ballot Question Four will affirm the law’s passage.
In addition to Ballot Question Four, Massachusetts voters will decide three other referendum questions, including an ongoing fight over a proposal to change the state’s tax system.
The Proponents of Question Four, including the group Safer Roads Massachusetts, say the law will reduce accidents and the number of uninsured drivers while helping immigrants by providing a means for them to drive legally and obtain an ID card. The passage of the law came after decades of advocacy on the issue.
Paul Diego Craney — a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, which is opposing the passage of Ballot Question Four — said the measure would not improve safety and called it unsustainable.
“The Registry of Motor Vehicles — the RMV — is not capable of processing these complicated immigration matters,” Craney said.
A recent University of Massachusetts Amherst poll showed 51 percent of registered voters support the measure, while 39 percent oppose it.
Voters will also weigh in on an amendment to the state constitution that would create a “millionaire’s tax” for Massachusetts’ top earners and exclusively allocate the increased revenue toward education and public transportation. If passed, the amendment would impose a 4 percent tax on annual incomes above $1 million.
The amendment’s proponents claim the tax would generate an additional $2 billion in revenue.
Andrew Farnitano, a spokesperson for Fair Share for Massachusetts, which has urged residents to vote yes on Ballot Question One, said the question’s supporters are “representing working people.”
Dan Cence, a spokesperson for the Coalition to Stop the Tax Hike Amendment, called the measure “ill-convinced” and poorly timed in a written statement.
“Question 1’s proposed Tax Hike Amendment will impact homeowners, small business owners, and retirees – all to provide lawmakers in Beacon Hill with funds to appropriate where they choose,” Cence wrote.
Fair Share for Massachusetts has raised over $26 million in support of Question One, while the Coalition to Stop the Tax Hike Amendment has raised $13 million.
If passed, Ballot Question Two will set a cap on non-patient related costs for dental insurance companies. Companies would be required to allocate 83 percent of spending toward patient care.
Massachusetts Dental Care Providers for Better Dental Benefits argue the measure would improve the quality of dental insurance by ensuring more money is spent on patient coverage and care than administrative costs and advertising. The group has raised over $6.9 million to support the bill.
Question Two opponent — the Committee to Protect Access to Quality Dental Care — argues the measure would increase the cost of dental care and has raised more than $6.2 million.
If passed, Ballot Question Three would double the maximum number of alcohol licenses a business can hold from nine to 18 by 2031.
Currently, businesses are capped at selling alcohol to just nine storefronts, regardless of how many locations they have. Proponents to double the license cap argue the measure would make it more convenient to purchase alcohol by increasing the number of stores where it is available.
The measure would further require that alcohol be sold at employee kiosks rather than self-checkouts to prevent minors from illegally purchasing it. Under the proposed law, fines for alcohol sale infractions would be based on the business’ total sales, rather than their total alcohol sales.
Baker has said Ballot Question Three is the only measure he will support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“That spell of five minutes cost us three goals—that will not happen to us again,” said Tjerk van Herwaarden, head coach of No. 15 Harvard field hockey, speaking on the Harvard-Princeton game.
Since 2016, Harvard and Princeton have engaged in a back and forth battle for the Ivy League championship title. These two Ivies bring a higher level of competitiveness and rivalry to their annual meeting because this matchup carries more weight in determining championship status and the league’s automatic bid into the NCAA tournament.
Harvard claimed the title last year. Now, it is likely to shift back to Princeton, who remains undefeated in the Ivy League, despite both schools holding a current 12-4 overall record.
“We prepared really well for it,” the coach reflected. “We knew what to expect from Princeton, we knew what we had to do.”
For the first five minutes of the game, Harvard seemed to be in control. They were passing well and pressing onto Princeton’s defense. But it didn’t take long for Princeton to take control of the game—the Tigers' Grace Schulze managed to sneak behind Harvard’s defense, squeezing one right past Crimson gatekeeper Ellie Shahbo and into the net.
“I don't know what that was…I have never seen that happen to our team before, but for the next four or five minutes, we completely lost it,” van Herwaarden said.
Right after this sweet shot into the mesh, Princeton ripped two more penalty corners into Harvard’s goal, all in the first quarter of the game. Shahbo stopped another in the second quarter, but the Crimson struggled to press into Tiger territory.
“I think that was a good message for us that unfortunately happened at the wrong time in one of the biggest games of the year,” van Herwaarden reflected.
Despite the Tigers edging the Crimson in a 4-2 outcome, the score doesn’t do justice to how hard Harvard fought back to try and tie it up to 3-3 in the third quarter. But the Crimson wasn’t able to stop another Tiger fire past its defense.
The fighting didn’t stop for Harvard in its next Ivy battle. In its game against No. 24 Cornell University last week, a penalty stroke from junior Siofra Murdoch pushed the Crimson past the Big Red in overtime. This is Harvard’s third victory against a ranked opponent this season. Cornell trails Harvard in the top three of current Ivy League standings, with a 3-3 conference record. The Big Red also recently beat No. 4 Louisville in an incredible 2-0 game, marking one of the biggest victories in the Ivy League school’s program history.
Despite the power dynamic switch between Harvard and Princeton, Harvard has done remarkably this season given its fresh roster. The Crimson have a 12-4 record and 0.750 winning percent with its top two offensive point holders being a first-year and sophomore, Bronte-May Brough and Emily Guckian, respectively. In the Cornell game, Brough scored the first goal tallying a total of seven shots on goal, and Guckian had one shot on goal and one assist.
“I think what we’ve been doing so far has been the one thing that’s really worked for us,” the head coach reflected. “Same for Princeton, same for Cornell, which were tough opponents for us, but eventually we dominated most of the game.”
Van Herwaarden added that he’s seen these “younger players step up and be able to make a really big impact in a great deal of these high profile games.”
Some of these high profile games occurred earlier in the season. The Crimson began its 2022 campaign with four games against ranked opponents: No. 14 University of Connecticut, No. 2 University of Maryland, and Miami (OH) University and American University, who are both no longer in the top 25. They recorded two victories against the latter and suffered two losses against the two universities in the top 15.
The only other two losses for Harvard were against No. 11 St. Joseph’s (in a respectable 1-0 finish) and No. 7 Princeton. In both of these games, however, Harvard seemed to dominate, only struggling to find the back of the net.
“The games that we lost were all very competitive. The Maryland game, the Princeton game, the St. Joe's game—they were all good games that we eventually lost,” van Herwaarden said. “I think we know that we need to do a little bit more on the front field.”
It is looking likely that Princeton will garner the automatic bid into the NCAA tournament from the Ivy League, but Harvard has a chance to get a bid as well, meaning the two schools have a chance to face one another again this year. The NCAA Selection Show will air on Sunday night.
“We keep our fingers crossed for whatever might be next.”
Harvard will close out its regular season down in Providence, R.I. in a matchup against Brown University on Saturday, Nov. 5 at 12:30 PM EST.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s sailing team continued its fleet racing success last weekend, with its two top-four finishes – in the Victoria Urn Trophy and the Schell Trophy – adding to a stellar tally of results over the last three months. The Crimson will hope to carry its momentum into the season-ending Women's Singlehanded National Championships, where it will be represented by sophomore Sophia Montgomery. The regatta will take place in Norfolk, Va., this coming weekend.
Last weekend saw the Harvard women travel to Providence, R.I. to compete in the Victoria Urn trophy, hosted by Brown. Overcoming shifting weather conditions, the Crimson turned in a well-rounded performance, with the A and B crews both placing fourth in their respective categories, to earn a cumulative score of 130 and a third-place finish. But nobody was catching the dominant Dartmouth side, which finished with a score of 101.
Harvard also sent a co-ed contingent to New London, Conn. to compete in Coast Guard’s Schell Trophy. In relatively gentle conditions, the Crimson earned a fourth-place finish, led by a strong performance in the A division by juniors Lachlan McGranahan and Pomaika’i Ogata, whose point total of 72 was second only to Yale’s 65.
The weekend’s strong results followed up on a successful fall slate, when Harvard overcame a poor 12th-place showing in its first event to claim six victories throughout the season. Most notably, it won the Open Atlantic Coast Championship (ACC) on Oct. 22-23 in New London. Overall, a Crimson crew finished in the top half of the standings in 21 of the team’s 28 events.
“This fall, the team had many victories on and off the water,” junior Marbella Marlo said. “Our co-ed team and women’s team both won the Atlantic Coast Championship (ACC) Qualifiers, and the co-ed team won ACCs finals. We also had many great memories off the water and became closer as a team, and are looking forward to carrying this momentum into our spring season.”
During the Open Atlantic Coast Championship Finals, third and first place finishes in the A and B divisions, respectively, were enough to seal a 12-point victory over Ivy powerhouses Yale and Dartmouth. First-years Justin Callahan and Kennedy Leehealey earned NEISA Open Sailors of the Week honors for the second time this season after their victory in the B division.
The ACC win exemplified the spectacular improvement that the Crimson has made since last season, when it failed to qualify for the co-ed final after an 11th-place finish in the first round. Joining Leehealey and Callahan in receiving honors was the duo of sophomore Cordelia Burn and junior Emily Launderville, who received the NEISA Women's Sailors of the Week award after their victory at the Yale Women’s Regatta.
For most of the Harvard squad, the fall season is over, as only Montgomery qualified for the Women's Singlehanded National Championships.
In a season of bright performances, Montgomery has been a shining light - her dominant victory in the NEISA Women’s Singlehanded Championship in September gave her an automatic bid into the National Championship, where the Bangkok, Thailand native will hope to build on her impressive fourth-place finish in 2021.
Montgomery attributed her success this fall to her supportive coaching team. While team racing is done in the FJ and 420 boat classes, individual racing is done in the Laser boat class, leaving the coaches with several categories to juggle in practice.
“The coaches have been super supportive, letting me divert from team practice to get more time in the laser…modifying practices for me, finding extra time to give me support and guidance while not taking too much away from the team,” she said. “I have an injury in my foot, so that’s not looking amazing, but I did get back in the boat this week and I was feeling pretty good.”
Overall, Montgomery maintained that the key to success so far this year was the team’s strong bond off the water.
“I think the most important moments of the fall were everyone working together over different weekends and spending time together, going to practice when it started to get really cold and yucky,” she said.
The Crimson will transition from fleet racing to team racing when it returns for the spring season, which will kick off in March 2023 and culminate in various National Championship races, where Harvard finished fourth, seventh and tenth in the Women’s National Championships, Team Race National Championships, and Dinghy National Championships, respectively, in 2022.
“I’m really really excited, especially for our co-ed team racing,” Montgomery said. “Our freshmen twin brothers, Mitchell and Justin [Callahan], are very good at team racing, and I’ve seen how they've been working with [junior] Lachlan [McGranahan], so I’m really excited for them to show what they can do. The women’s team has also been improving a lot, so I think we’re in a very good spot for the spring.”

We’ve all been there. It’s 9:02 a.m. You’re sprinting through the Yard to class, hoping to still beat the athlete who’s locking up their scooter. Then, you see it: a group of tourists posing for the cliche-yet-tasteful “Touching of John Harvard’s Shoe.” Forgetting about the hot section kid you’re trying to impress, you are forced to stop and shudder. While the visitors’ eyes light up as they touch the bronze beauty, you can only recall the ~other things~ you’ve heard about taking place there *shudders*.
Here, Flyby breaks down four things we would rather touch than JoJo’s tainted toe:
#4: 2 a.m. Jefe’s Toilet
While standing in line to use Jefe’s toilet can feel like a nightmare, we can be comforted knowing that just that morning, Jefe’s’ crew was hard at work cleaning this majestic throne. On the other hand, the closest J-Harv gets to sanitation is his glistening “morning dew” following a Harvard student’s night out.
#3: The Water Bottle You Haven’t Washed Since You Got Here
Just wash it. Please, just wash it. And, despite popular opinion: No, the dhall’s Powerade-water synthesis does not count as soap. Alas, since we know you won’t, we will put your Hydroflask’s microbiome at #3.
#2:  A Canaday Carpet
For you STEM girlies, what do 48 years multiplied by 250 first-years multiplied by an average of 3 stains per student produce? An amalgamation of stenches and smears that still remain less disturbing than Good ol’ Johnny’s boot.
#1: Patient 0 of the Frat Flu
You know who you are. Your hacking coughs and sniffling nose invoked a SideChat mask debate and caused every student to Google, “Did I pay the Harvard Student Health fee?” Yet, compared to John, we would still rather hug you (consensually, of course).
Honorable Mentions: 
The Memorial Church Rats
The Floor of Sigma Chi
We understand that tourists’ traditions are rooted in Harvard Yard, but dear God, we hope you have alcohol-based hand sanitizer. And to the next Harvard daredevil looking for a story, perhaps just pass JH by at 3 a.m instead.
