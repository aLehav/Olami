After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Occupy Wall Street has inspired disenfranchised masses to sleep in public parks and send angry tweets to the digital void. The movement’s popular power should be harnessed for cultural good. What places, institutions, or events should we all occupy?
5. A Skrillex Concert
After Skrillex opens the show with a high-pitch synth line, Occupiers will chant “This is what democracy looks like!” until Skrillex apologizes for dubstep and retires.
4. The Today Show Set
When Al Roker starts asking audience members which part of Maryland they’re from, Occupiers will begin chanting in unison about the utopian potential of anarchism.
3. Norton Juster’s Lawn
Fifty years since “The Phantom Tollbooth” and still no sequel. Occupiers will pitch tents on Juster’s front yard and use the people’s mic every night after his bedtime until he begins “The Phantom Tollbooth 2.”
2. The Oscars Red Carpet Ceremony
Occupiers will argue about points of process until 99 percent of viewers have switched to an activity less soul-crushingly boring than watching the Oscars Red Carpet Ceremony.
1. The Harvard Crimson
Something eventually has to be done to get “15 Hottest Freshmen: All Summer Long” off The Crimson’s “Most Read” articles list.
—Outgoing propaganda executive and covers executive and incoming culture minister and chair Alexander E. Traub is a floppy-haired Jew, possible Pinko, and fellow traveler of Vegans.

5. Maggie Goes On a Diet
The self-published picture book by author Paul Kramer made a splash on the Internet earlier this year. Marketed to the 12-and-under crowd, the book encourages young girls to diet, because, you know, you are never too young for body-image issues.
4. Where Children Sleep, James Mollison
James Mollison’s photographic essay illustrates the stories of children worldwide through portraits and pictures of their bedrooms. The project turned a set of childrens’ bedrooms into a stark commentary on class and poverty, and gave unwanted gravitas to your old Power Rangers sheets.
3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2
The final “Harry Potter” installment signaled the end of childhood for many people, which makes one wonder if long-running popular children’s series are really just ticking time bombs of reality. In other words, be prepared for the discontent of the Twi-Hards come the release of “Breaking Dawn — Part 2.”
2. Avenue Q
The long-running Broadway musical parodied “Sesame Street” by turning the Muppets into foul-mouthed young-adults facing very real problems. Is nothing sacred? The eleventh number, “You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want (When You’re Makin’ Love),” replete with puppet-on-puppet sex and full-on puppet nudity, answers with a deafening “yes.”
1. The Muppets (2011 remake)
The critically acclaimed Jason Segel vehicle has done the Muppets justice. They are as sweet and innocent as ever. In fact, the only reason it makes the list is that the need for a Muppets remake is a reminder of how old I am, making me fear for my own childhood. Welcome to the Vanity Issue.

I’ve heard a lot this year about the music section’s lack of “Watch the Throne” coverage. I would like to take this opportunity to palliate if not remedy this absence.  “Watch the Throne,” perhaps the most self-congratulatory work of art since Louis XIV had himself painted as Alexander the Great, is a good record. However, the actual quality of the songs pails in comparison to the praise heaped upon it by its own creators. Most notably, in the ongoing Watch the Throne tour, Jay-Z and Kanye West have played “N***as in Paris” up to seven times a show.  Here are some of the unreleased tracks getting bumped from those prized encore spots.
1. “Niggas in Normandy”
This song is just “Niggas in Paris,” but with a more jarring, more hyper-syllabic rhyme scheme.
2. “Jay-Z, Would You Rap Over This Please?”
One of Kanye’s favorite beats—a remix of scratching and grunting noises from Judy Garland’s seminal “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” laced with light opera arias.  At the end of every measure, Kanye shouts “Jay-Z!”  There is no rapping on this track.
3. “E.G.O.”
A song about the environment and Freudian theories of personality, this track also features the beat from “Niggas in Paris.”
4. “Misnomer”
This song is “Niggas in Paris.”
5. “Cowbell”
Like “Niggas in Paris,” this song samples a famous Will Ferrell soundbyte—the seminal Saturday Night Live “More Cowbell” sketch.  The beat is three minutes of Blue Oyster Cult’s “Don’t Fear The Reaper” and three minutes of Kanye complimenting Jay-Z’s shirt.  Jay-Z is not featured on this track.
—Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey is the outgoing music executive. He is already regretting this photo (see left).

It’s been a fun 65 years, but the Pax Europa is on the way out. The sovereign debt crisis has put so much strain on the European Union that the system of cooperative confederacy that has prevailed since the Second World War has been hopelessly compromised.
There were good times to be sure. If you were really lucky, you got to bunga bunga alongside Silvio Berlusconi as Rome’s economy burned. But the years of cheap credit, flash-frozen by the mortgage crisis across the pond, have left an irreconcilable divide between the creditors and the debtors. Now the Eurozone faces an existential crisis as all involved decide whether the union can be saved. As leaders from creditor nations scramble to create a combination of fiscal integration and austerity that could possibly save the common currency, the member nations are left with two unsavory options: fracture the Eurozone or preserve the union at the cost of individual sovereignty.
This current crisis epitomizes what critics of European economic integration feared. A liberal flow of credit was the peace dividend of continental stability and growth. This easy money, alongside the consequent housing bubble, allowed Greece and others to finance luxurious social programs and high wages. Tax evasion became widespread. When the music stopped during the financial crisis of 2008, countries in crisis had no way to adapt their economy to the new situation. Traditionally, a nation could simply inflate its way into solvency or devalue its currency to spur exports. Painful solutions, but ones that can rescue a nation’s finances. Due to the common currency, though, these debtor nations had no such options.
Now, they must rely on the largesse of more financially stable members to prevent defaults. French and German leaders have attempted to create packages that will bail these countries out including, but not limited to, an International Monetary Fund loan package. A package like this in some form is ultimately the only way to save the economic union, and it needs to be passed quickly.
However, on both sides of the solution, parties are highly uneasy. Debtor nations fear the economic reorganization that will be required by whatever organization ends up rescuing them. The IMF, that symbol of post-Second World War global cooperation, is notorious for mandating unpopular political and economic reforms as a condition of its funding. Similarly, any package that goes through the EU will likely require those countries to submit their budgets for approval by the body. Any solution that involves a bailout will almost by definition infringe on individual nations’ sovereignty and bring everyone closer to a one-Europe government.
Germany, the white knight to whom everyone is looking, is dragging its feet for other reasons. Still bearing the scars of the hyperinflation that occurred during the Weimar Republic, it is hesitant to take any steps that could lead to spiraling inflation. A solution that is popular everywhere except in Germany is to fund the bailouts through the release of Eurobonds, thereby increasing the indebtedness of the entire union. Also, there is a fundamental sense of injustice among Germans indignant about being forced to subsidize other nations’ profligacy.
As a result of these aversions to the solutions that would save the Eurozone, many expect the common currency to fracture or dissolve. The fears of being dragged into an inflation spiral could bring Germany and other like-minded countries to withdraw from the Euro and create a new currency. Or the fears of being subjugated to the demands of the rest of the continent would encouraged some debtor countries to withdraw and manipulate a new currency to sacrifice economic strength for political sovereignty.
Whichever way it happens, changing the membership composition of the Euro would have devastating economic consequences. Depending on the way creditor nations go, the Euro could either skyrocket or plummet in value, which would have massive consequences on the foreign exchange and would add a whole new level of volatility that would constrict worldwide capital flows. A new global recession would be almost inevitable.
So now the Eurozone faces a critical decision point. Is it worth a further consolidation of continental governance, and the corresponding escalated economic interdependency to save the union? From a world markets standpoint—yes. In fact, an auction of German bonds last week left over a third of the offering unsold, demonstrating that the market is losing its confidence in even the strongest of European economies. But the prospects of building a lifeboat before the currency sinks into the sea dwindle by the day. Even if a solution is passed and accepted, the members of the Eurozone will find themselves even more hopelessly intertwined and further on the road toward centralized governance from Brussels.
The Greeks brought democracy into this world, and it looks like they can help to take it out, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yes, this is another piece about the Boy Scout tent fest in Harvard Yard.
Occupy Harvard is a brilliant concept. Whoever organized the camp out must have drooled over the potential photo-op: a laundry dump of shabby, canvas tents surrounded by the Versailles of higher education. No, the imagery would be grander: it would be little David thumbing his nose at the Goliath of elite universities. Harvard is so saturated with symbolism that this clambake-for-disenfranchised-leftists-passing-as-a-protest was inevitable from day one.
Which (I say this reluctantly) is not a completely terrible thing. All but the most cork-brained libertarian must confess that the general Occupy fever shines a light on ugly facts. Income inequality has skyrocketed in the last few decades. Between 1979 and 2007, virtually all increases in national income went to the top 20 percent of the population, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Even among that upper echelon, most of the income gains have ka-chinged their way into the obese wallets of the top one percent, who enjoyed a 275 percent growth in real, after tax household income. During the same period, the bottom 20 percent of the population saw only an 18 percent rise. So the last three decades of America’s economic growth have mostly brought more private jets to those already floating in the economic stratosphere, and done diddlely-squat for the rest of us.
If you’re concerned about our national health, then these numbers should scare you. In addition to perpetuating class warfare, a staggering income gap may, as Paul R. Krugman argues, chip away at our democratic ideals.
Democracy relies on each person having a more or less equal say in government. Yet the political process favors the rich, who can afford to wage wallet-sapping campaigns or, if not running for office, help along the candidate of their choice with lip-lickingly large campaign donations. Rather than being spread equally as democracy requires, political power in our country tends to be concentrated in the hands, or rather the pockets, of the wealthy.
Which brings us back to Occupy Harvard. The occupiers in the Yard are ringing the alarm on something profoundly troubling about our nation. They’ve got the diagnosis right: our country is buckling from unequal-itis. But they have the prescription wrong: pitching camp in slick, expensive looking tents is a rather thick way of protesting the rich-poor gap. So is, for that matter, walking out of the Ec 10 lecture on income inequality.
Thus, it is mildly rewarding to watch a nationwide movement come to a liberal institution like Harvard and then protest in puerile ways that cause it to die a thousand deaths, whether in the Crimson pieces calling the movement a “disgrace” or in the obscenities students utter when they are made late to class by a locked gate. Don’t you feel bad for the Yard Occupiers? It must be wrenching to spearhead a tent stunt only to see it check out, keel over, kick the bucket, bite the big one, meet its maker, and croak. And next imagine having to watch as your pet protest is drawn-and-quartered by classmates, occasionally kicked around by newspaper editorials, and constantly anvil-smashed over the head by a few Crimson opinion writers.
Occupy Harvard’s hollow thud of defeat provides a lesson for anyone looking to change the system. We, as restless and idealistic citizens, like to change the world quickly by staging symbolic protests. When it comes to venting our discontent at income inequality, it’s easy to think that running through the streets and pumping our fists at the wealth gap is all that is needed. The image of dank tents juxtaposed against big, bad Harvard is evocative precisely because we are moved by David-and-Goliath imagery. The Occupy movement is a specimen of this myopic yearning for symbolic protest that aims for sweeping change overnight.
But the change the Occupiers want is tectonic change— the gradual shifting of our economic values, the leveling of our income disparity—and it isn’t advanced by symbolism or by tents in Harvard Yard, and in any case it will take time. Restructuring our economic landscape will be a complex process with no quick fix. What we can do is redirect educational resources and be patient. It will be a slow war, fought by university students who, each week and each month, sacrifice part of their time to teach the underprivileged—not by kids camping out in Harvard Yard.
So, students, philosophers, bums, fellow classmates, and anyone else pitching tents in front of University Hall, get out of the Yard. Get back to your homes, take a shower, and, wait—did you say something about wanting to reduce the income gap? Then I challenge you to volunteer in South Boston to teach disadvantaged kids. I challenge you to change lives by working with organizations like Let’s Get Ready to provide poor students with the college guidance resources their rich counterparts already have. I challenge you to coach underprivileged Boston kids on the SAT, or work with them on their college application essays. I know these measures are not glamorous; they’re down and dirty. You probably won’t get coverage in the New York Times for doing these things, and they (at first) may feel less rewarding than sticking your chin out against Harvard Hall as the media cameras roll. But these measures work.
Occupiers, if you want to overhaul our economic state, then quit camping around and get busy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been three weeks since the University began locking down Harvard Yard, and Occupy Harvard has yet to acknowledge any responsibility for this.
Since Nov. 9, members and sympathizers of the movement have bombarded Crimson readers with editorials blasting the administration for its unprecedented shutdown. “We do not share the perception that the Occupy movement constitutes a threat to Harvard,” reads an open letter signed by almost thirty faculty members. “The ongoing ID checks and partial gate closures are as unnecessary as they are inconvenient,” an official Occupy statement asserted earlier this month. Dylan R. Matthews ’12 went so far as to argue that the lockdown makes so little practical sense that it must be the university’s method of “resisting” the Occupiers, “a very savvy means of turning students against protestors.”
These arguments, simply put, are either willfully ignorant or dangerously myopic. The university was, and still is, justified in implementing this security measure. Occupy Harvard is doing a disservice to its cause, the student body, and the larger Cambridge community for failing to realize this.
Occupiers tend to liken their protest to the 2001 Living Wage campaign, in which protestors pitched nearly 90 tents in the Yard over the course of three weeks. The administration didn’t shut down access to the Yard then, Occupy Harvard reasons, so why is it doing so now?
This comparison would make sense if Harvard didn’t have strong reason to conclude that leaving the gates open would encourage “individuals whose intentions were not peaceful” to encamp in the Yard. But Occupy Harvard is a part of the global Occupy movement. And unless it chooses to splinter, this effectively means that if Harvard opened its gates, hundreds of non-Harvard affiliated Occupiers would likely flood in and create a full-blown Occupy encampment on Harvard’s private property.
Occupy sympathizers apparently can’t imagine why the university would have a problem with this. I can venture a guess.
Before Occupy Harvard set up shop, three sexual assaults were reported to the police at Occupy Wall Street. The threat of rape became so palpable there that the protestors established a female-only sleeping tent that needed consistent guarding from an all-female patrol. A dozen assaults were reported two weeks ago at Occupy San Francisco over the course of only 24 hours. Occupy Portland alone has caused an estimated $19,000 worth of property damage, and a man was recently arrested there for throwing a Molotov cocktail.
The list goes on and on. Two protestors were recently arrested for suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon at Occupy Los Angeles. A protestor at Occupy Fort Collins was arrested earlier this month for starting a $10 million arson fire. A reporter asserted in October that “vandalism, assaults, and theft regularly occur” at Occupy Berkeley and incidences of violence average three per night there. This isn’t to even mention Occupy Oakland, whose infamous ills include a fatal shooting, vandalism, arsons, and shattered windows.
Some might argue that Occupy Boston has been largely immune from these dangers, but such an assertion is contrary to the facts. Since October, 21 locations around downtown Boston have been vandalized with Occupy Boston graffiti, two Occupiers have been arrested for selling heroin to an undercover police officer, a female Occupier has physically assaulted three police officers, and a male protestor has been arrested for threatening to murder another man with a knife.
Occupy Harvard, of course, would most likely respond that individual acts shouldn’t define the entire movement, which professes nonviolence. That’s true. But it’s true as well that, unlike 10 years ago, there’s a wealth of evidence to conclude today that allowing hundreds of non-Harvard affiliates to protest in the Yard indefinitely would make it a far more dangerous place. Occupy is completely justified in pitching a public tent city on public property where the University has no responsibility for the welfare of the protestors and the passersby. But Harvard cannot put the safety of its students—for that is what is at stake here—at risk for the sake of free speech.
At the very least, Occupy Harvard could acknowledge this threat and propose a reasonable security alternative. Instead, many Occupiers have unfairly chosen to frame the Yard lockdown as an unprovoked assault on their civil rights. “Speech cannot genuinely be free in a location heavily locked down by security,” three protestors, for example, wrote in the Crimson on Monday. “If Harvard genuinely cared about freedom of speech…it would open its gates.”
This kind of rhetoric aids no one. It does nothing to assuage the legitimate fears of the administration and parents of Harvard freshmen. It does nothing to ensure that Cambridge visitors, who desire nothing more than to see the John Harvard statue, are able to enter the Yard as soon as possible.
In short, the movement must start taking responsibility for the gates’ closure and stop writing off the administration’s security claims as unfounded. Occupy Harvard has spent the last three weeks demanding honesty and accountability from the University. It’s time the University starts demanding it from them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Monday, Director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, Ryan M. Travia, told students at a discussion about alcohol policy that alcohol-related admissions to University Health Services had decreased this semester, as compared with previous years. Such a decline comes on the heels of three years of marked increases, which many attribute to the 2007 institution of the amnesty policy. No hard statistics have been released concerning the decline in admissions, and we have no sense of how significant it actually was. Travia also took the opportunity to attribute the decrease to the Office of Student Life’s financial support for non-alcoholic activities, as well as the recent College-wide crack-down on dangerous drinking practices, such as drinking games.
Considering the utter lack of hard data regarding the decline in alcohol-related admissions, it would be unwise to draw knee-jerk conclusions about the effectiveness of the administration’s new alcohol policy. At a time when the College, as a community, is looking to reevaluate its underage drinking policies, it would be irresponsible to use a vague, possibly statistically insignificant decline in admissions to justify decisions that, as far as we can see, may have in fact worked against student welfare.
The lack of statistics from University Health Services regarding the decline in alcohol-related admissions is part of a broader problem: that UHS withholds potentially valuable information from students. We understand their concern for student confidentiality, yet we believe that the community stands much to gain from deeper insight into dangerous drinking at Harvard. So long as an individual’s privacy is maintained, confidentiality should not act as a defense against transparency. If student leaders had an idea of not only how many alcohol-related admissions there were, but also on which days they occurred, they could better gauge whether their own organizations’ social events were contributing to hospital admissions. Furthermore, it would be useful for all students to know how many admits are freshmen, versus how many are upperclassmen. It is easy to presume that one group, or set of locations, stand responsible for a preponderance of admissions; more data would help students tell whether such presumptions are in fact misguided.
Attempting to use undisclosed statistics as evidence for the success of new anti-drinking policies turns what should be an open discussion on the subject into a kangaroo court, where only those rendering the verdict have seen the evidence. Everyone can agree that students and administrators share a single goal: making sure students are both safe and happy. We appreciate the administration’s efforts to include students through recent discussions on the topic. We simply hope that they don’t jump too quickly at the opportunity to claim success, when success is far from certain. The College’s reevaluation of underage drinking policy should be open, inclusive, and measured. It may be the case that the ban on drinking games has had an effect, but it is just too soon to tell.

University representatives and government officials, including Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, gathered yesterday morning with the Holyoke community to celebrate the placing of the final steel beam on the structure of Massachusetts’s latest state-of-the-art research computing initiative.
The “topping-off” ceremony marked the completion of the steel structure of the $168 million Massachusetts Green High-Performance Computing Center, a unique partnership between five of the state’s major research universities—Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Northeastern, and the University of Massachusetts—as well as the state government, and two firms in the technology industry.
“We are delighted with the progress the topping-off ceremony represents for this terrific collaboration,” said Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey.
The 90,000 square-foot-facility directly responds to the needs of the universities for greater computing power, according to Casey.
The high-speed “supercomputers” at the Center will be able to parse through a trillion bytes of data on a daily basis, allowing researchers to perform advanced analyses relevant to many fields, including environmental modeling, health, and education.
Researchers will make use of the Center’s computing power remotely through fast-fiber connections and virtual networks.
The Center will promote a “green” mission through its use of energy-efficient technologies including hydroelectrically generated power. It will also facilitate research into clean energy and advanced computing technologies, including cloud, virtualization, and information integration, according to the Center’s website.
The facility will eventually house the entirety of Harvard’s computing hardware.
The final 18 foot, 800 pound beam was signed by officials and adorned with an American flag, Massachusetts Commonwealth flag, and an evergreen tree before being placed on the structure by an Iron Workers Union local.
The research facility will create 13 permanent Holyoke jobs and approximately 130 research positions at the universities.
At the ceremony, Governor Patrick praised the center’s ability to spark collaboration amongst the research institutions involved and throughout the state.
“We turn to each other rather than turning on each other,” Patrick said.
The construction site itself will function as a public classroom, inviting students from Holyoke schools to develop their building skills while participating in the construction process.
“We have to be about building our future, inventing our own destiny,” Patrick said.
Construction of the Center, which began on August 25, is expected to be completed in 2012.

President of the World Bank Robert B. Zoellick discussed the modernization of the international financial institution at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday evening.
Zoellick said the Bank has sought to portray itself as a center of knowledge and learning as part of the modernization process.
In a recent step towards this goal, he explained, the Bank opened up seven thousand of its internal data sets to the public for free. In the future, Zoellick said, he would like to create an interactive platform to share information with mobile devices, a “transformative” development in the exchange of information between individuals and the Bank.
These changes would further increase the World Bank’s ability to help developing countries, Zoellick said. To engage developing countries in the learning process, Zoellick said they needed to be treated as clients who can make their own decisions.
Zoellick also discussed the problems that the Bank faced when he assumed his position as president and the ways in which he approached them. Wrestling with leadership issues, the Bank faced the “deeper crisis” of modernizing the World Bank’s approach to reconstruction, economic development, and political activism, according to Zoellick.
“The fundamentals hadn’t been addressed,” he said.
The Bank had to shift its focus from “existential questions” to practical issues and goals, he said. To that end, the Bank brought in people who could achieve the necessary innovative solutions.
Although “textbook solutions” to complex social problems often tempt policymakers, Zoellick said, economists need a basic political understanding to grasp underlying issues and create viable solutions.
A technocratic solution divorced from the political and institutional context is ultimately useless, according to Zoellick. Streamlined execution is essential to applying policies that start out merely as theories.
Zoellick also said that the previous model of decision making was not successful.
“We’ve learned that top down, belief-driven models are bound for failure,” Zoellick said.
To offset the deeply ingrained “institutional architecture” that can make the Bank appear secluded and aloof, Zoellick said he increased transparency to encourage better decision-making by opening up channels to engage with the issues.
Stephanie Wu ’15, who attended the talk, said she appreciated Zoellick’s experience-based insight.
“It’s interesting that you can’t separate economics from the political context,” she said.

James K. McAuley ’12, a senior in Currier House and Chair of the Crimson’s Editorial Board, was the only Harvard student awarded a Marshall Scholarship this year.
The prestigious scholarship is open to U.S. citizens who will have graduated from a four-year college or university once they matriculate into a masters program in the United Kingdom. They must also hold a minimum GPA of 3.7.
The Marshall Scholarship is awarded to up to 40 students each year. Of the 36 scholarships awarded this year, five of the recipients are from Princeton, two are from University of Pennsylvania, one from Columbia, and one from Yale.
McAuley has written extensively for the Crimson’s Arts, Editorial, and News sections, but his journalistic ambitions have not stopped there.
He worked at the International Herald Tribune during the summer of 2010 as a Jaromir Ledecky International Journalism Fellow. “It was great being in the office there. The people were just really inspiring if you want to be a journalist,” McAuley said.
Last summer, he interned at the New Yorker, which not only gave him experience in research and writing, but also acted as a “hall of fame” of sorts for some of his favorite writers. McAuley also spent much of his summer working as a research assistant for biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin.
A member of Phi Beta Kappa, McAuley is a History and Literature concentrator from Dallas, Texas. He is currently writing his senior thesis on a Spanish diplomat who in 1940 gave visas to Jews who were trying to leave occupied France. He intends to maintain his focus on modern European history as he pursues a Master of Philosophy degree at Oxford beginning in the fall, where he hopes to continue working on the topics covered in his thesis.
McAuley’s thesis advisor, French History Professor Patrice L. R. Higonnet ’58, has been working with him as he studies the questions of how European diplomats handled the very complicated and difficult situations they were faced with in Vichy France. When asked about McAuley, Higonnet praised both his academic and personal attributes.
“He’s a very intelligent and brilliant young man, but particularly he has a wisdom beyond his years that is very curious,” Higonnet said. He was “not surprised at all” when he found out that McAuley had been named a Marshall Scholar.
When asked about the personal significance of his achievement, McAuley expressed gratitude above all else for the opportunities that the Marshall Scholarship will provide him.
From an early age, he knew that he loved history and that it was something he wanted to pursue.
“I’m so grateful for the opportunity to get to pursue a study of history in the UK of all places.,” he said. “I can’t thank everyone who has helped me along the way enough for getting me to where I’ll be going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College wrapped up a series of meetings on Harvard’s drinking culture Tuesday night with a conversation in the Dunster JCR that included administrators, tutors, and students.
The meetings, designed to solicit student input as the College works to update its alcohol policies, have been poorly attended by students. Low turnout has raised concerns for some students at the meetings, who have questioned whether the small sampling is representative of broader attitudes on campus toward alcohol.
At a meeting between Adams and Quincy students, Adams House Committee Co-Chair Collin A. Rees ’12 pointed out that the participants—mostly Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, Undergraduate Council representatives, and HoCo members—might not be a representative sample of the spectrum of student attitudes.
“There was a very distinct set of people here and all viewpoints weren’t represented,” Rees said. “I don’t think we saw much of the drinking side or partying sides of Harvard.”
A freshman-specific meeting in the Yard attracted six students—four of whom were freshman Undergraduate Council representatives. Tuesday’s audience was full of DAPA and HoCo members who skirted sensitive issues as administrators guided the conversation with their own questions and opinions.
A Dunster tutor who attended Tuesday’s meeting characterized the discussion as “representative of the responsible drinking culture.”
“But I don’t think it had much of the drinking voice,” the tutor said.
Only seven students were in attendance Tuesday, following the larger trend of a lackluster attendance at the alcohol discussions.
The first alcohol conversation attracted enough students to fill the Winthrop Junior Common Room. The participants were candid and enthusiastic enough about the topic to push the discussion more than 30 minutes over its allotted meeting time.
But since then, meetings have last the allotted time and attendance has dwindled. The Adams/Quincy, Leverett/Dunster, Cabot/Currier/Pfoho, and freshman-specific meetings drew less than 10 students each.
Students and House administrators at all meetings have praised the focus on student-feedback that led to the conception of the alcohol discussions. They asked that the College host more meetings in order to hear more student perspectives.
For now, however, the College says it is done with the alcohol discussions.
The extent to which feedback from the conversations will shape the modified alcohol policy—and the final form that policy will take—is up to the handful of students and administrators that make up the alcohol policy committee.
“What we’re trying to do is be very open to listening to students, especially since people have very different perspectives on the issue of alcohol,” said Rakesh Khurana, Cabot House Master and chair of the alcohol policy committee. “We think that’s one of the first steps to take in order to make sure that we have a policy that is both responsible and workable, but always with the goal in mind of our students’ well being. And that is where we’re coming from, is making sure that nobody gets hurt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a short absence from the College upon the dissolution of the Committee on Human Rights Studies in 2010, the Harvard Undergraduate Human Rights Coalition revamped its advocacy efforts with a letter-writing campaign for political prisoners last night.
As part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign, the group offered students passing through Cabot Café a chance to sign a pre-written letter to local officials urging that political prisoners in over fifteen countries, including the United States, be granted a diverse array of political rights.
“A lot of times people wonder if these letters make a difference, but the public pressure makes a difference and political prisoners like to know that they have support,” said Maya S. Sugarman ’12, the event organizer.
Sugarman said she saw the event as not only an opportunity to combat human rights violations, but also a way to encourage students to become more aware of and involved in human rights efforts on campus.
Focusing on catching people coming into the Café instead of publicizing the event, Sugarman said she thought the event was “a great chance” for people to learn about the group, come together, and “make a difference” by showing their support.
The Human Rights Advocates was founded in 2004 as a spin-off of Harvard Law School’s advocacy programs, but the group re-emerged recently as the Coalition and has participated in numerous letter-writing campaigns since 2009.
While most past events were held at local coffee shops, an on-campus location proved to be the ideal place to “encourage the dialogue on human rights,” according to Ada D. Lin ’14, one of the co-directors of the group along with Sugarman.
But the group’s efforts have many off-campus ties as well. The present incarnation of the group remains involved in a number of human rights activities, including water-rights projects and projects to promote cultural survival of indigenous populations in Peru and Guatemala.
The group also meets regularly with fellows from the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.
Though the work of the Coalition is diverse, the group hopes to continue to hold similar letter writing campaigns in the future, according to Wren R. Droege ’14, who is planning another such campaign at Gato Rojo in the next few weeks.
“There are so many violations across the world because no one says anything,” Lin said. “The first step is making the issue known.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kabungo Yanick Mulumba ’15 speaks with a rich accent, a result of years of speaking Sub-Saharan Bantu dialects such as Nyanja, and wears a bright, easy smile that belies an inner seriousness.
“I knew Harvard is big,” he says, “but when I stepped on campus, the magnitude struck me. I could see it is very different from the largest university in Zambia.”
To say that Mulumba has had more to adapt to than the average Harvard freshman would be a major understatement—in fact, it is hard to imagine two cities with less in common than Cambridge, MA, and Maamba, Zambia, the small mining town in the southern region of the country that he calls home.
Mulumba is the only student from Zambia, a country of almost 13 million people, currently enrolled in the College. As there is only one other Zambian enrolled at Harvard, a student at the Divinity School, Mulumba’s journey, and motivations for embarking on that journey, stand out as remarkable even on a highly diverse and multicultural campus.
“My long term goal is to become a specialist, most likely a neurosurgeon,” says Mulumba, and his ambition to become a doctor is far from unique among Harvard students. But unlike most of his fellow pre-meds, Mulumba hopes to practice in a Zambian hospital, putting his practice in a Zambian hospital, putting his newly acquired skills to work in a setting where he feels they are urgently needed.
While in 2010 the World Bank named Zambia one of the world’s fastest reforming countries in terms of its economy, its health care situation remains dire. The county’s per capita GDP is around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund (compared to about $45,000 in the U.S.), making it very difficult for the average citizen to afford private care. And according to the British Broadcasting Company, the country’s doctor-to-citizen ratio is approximately one to 14,000, as opposed to one to 600 in the United Kingdom, for example.
But inspired by the example of his father, a doctor in Zambia, Mulumba hopes to use his Harvard education to combat the health problems that pervade his home country.
Mulumba’s journey to Harvard and post-graduation ambitions embody the University’s goal of attracting a highly international and globally conscious student body, composed of individuals who bring their unique cultural viewpoint to Harvard, and know first-hand just how much the developing world needs their help.
THE ODYSSEY
Making Mulumba’s story even more uncommon is the fact that two years ago, he had no intention of studying in America. Mulumba, like many international students applying to college in the U.S., experienced many logistical challenges, such as immigration and visa procedures, in addition to SAT and application fees that can be prohibitively expensive.
Despite being a star student at one of the most prestigious high schools in Zambia, volunteering extensively in a hospital, and leading his local Red Cross Club, Mulumba’s road to college in America was long indeed.
A critical ally along that road was the United States Achievers Program (USAP), an organization that works with the U.S. Embassy to help top students in economically disadvantaged areas apply to American colleges.
The Zambian branch of the program, though only operational since 2009, is already flooded with interest—last year it was able to accept only 16 out of 160 applicants.
“Students like Yanick are what Zambia really needs,” says Patricia Madigan, director of USAP Zambia. “Harvard’s system is hugely welcoming to international students, and getting these kids a U.S. education really enables them to be leaders.”
Mulumba, the second of five children, says his family supported his weighty decision and is extremely excited that he is at Harvard, despite missing him.
“We’re praying for him, and hope that he is well,” says his father, Dr. Kabungo Mulumba. “Even though he’s so far from home, we know how important his studies are.”
JUMPING IN HEADFIRST
Unlike some international students, Mulumba has the advantage of having spoken English all his life—nevertheless, there were an abundance of opportunities for culture shock when he first arrived on campus.
“Annenberg food is...” he paused before continuing, “very different,” says Mulumba with a laugh, citing home-cooked Zambian food such as nshima, a popular cornmeal dish, as something he misses most. But a change in diet was just the beginning of the adaptations he has faced.
Across the board, academic life at Harvard has been a dramatic departure from his classes back home.
“Math here is much more than just calculations—there’s lots of conceptual and analytical work, too,” says Mulumba, a potential Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator.
And while he describes his workload as “challenging,” he says he is on the whole doing well in the face of a slew of massive transitions both cultural and intellectual.
He also finds time for several extracurricular activities, such as volunteering for a Peer Health Exchange group with the Phillip Brooks House Association.
He attributes some of his success to Harvard’s academic support resources, saying “there’s always someone willing to help,” such as his freshman academic advisor, Professor of Biochemistry Guido Guidotti.
“It’s important that students have someone who will listen,” says Guidotti, an immigrant himself, who came to the U.S. from Italy in the 1950s.
“But Yanick has the energy and vigor to do things that are directed towards others, and that counts for a great deal.”
A HOME AWAY FROM HOME
As foreign as life at Harvard initially seemed to Mulumba, he says that student groups and advisors have done much to make him feel welcome.
When it comes to helping international students ease into their new environment, University organizations like the Freshman International Program and the Harvard International Office have established a diverse set of resources.
For example, the Harvard African Students Association hosts a weekly dinner, complete with African food, that Mulumba says helps to foster a feeling of community despite the absence of other Zambian students.
Chisom M. Okpala ’15, the only Nigerian student in her class and freshman representative of HASA, has been friends with Mulumba since they both joined USAP.
“Everyone has been so welcoming, so friendly,” says Okpala. “We have a really wide support community.”
For example, Okpala says that African freshman were given a $175 clothing stipend to help them cope with Harvard’s harsh winters, and that she has received personal messages from her Resident Dean of Freshman, Catherine Shapiro, asking about her well-being.
Okpala describes her feelings about being an African student as a mixture of pressure and pride. “I know so much is on me, given this incredible opportunity,” she says.
She also emphasized the role that Mulumba’s roots have played in his desire to become a doctor, explaining that, “When you’ve seen that much suffering and morbidity in your home country, it motivates you and helps you focus, because you know you have so much to contribute,” says Okpala.
But intense future goals aside, Mulumba is able for the moment to simply enjoy the experience of being a freshman at Harvard.
He is free to be his gregarious, inquisitive self, and says he is becoming increasingly at home on campus, regardless of how alien it first seemed.
“Harvard is the best place to be,” says Mulumba, flashing a wide grin. “You have so many opportunities, and so many people who are willing to help you

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Judy Z. Jiao ’14 did not know it at the time, her life was completely transformed by a trip to the mall. She was approached, at the age of 13, by a talent scout who invited her to attend a commercial acting convention.
Before the chance meeting, Jiao viewed herself as an extremely shy girl and had never considered acting. Nevertheless, she seized the opportunity. At the convention, Jiao was paired with an agent and soon began taking acting lessons. Three years later, she was asked to star on a Canadian-produced television show called “Degrassi: The Next Generation.”
Jiao portrayed Leia Chang, a teenage ballet dancer and student at Degrassi Community School, for three seasons. Yet since coming to Harvard, she has decided to leave acting aside to pursue her other interests.
“Being at Harvard is such an incredible experience,” she said. “I would never give that up for anything.”
ACTING BEGINNINGS
Jiao’s parents emigrated from China to Toronto, Ontario, where her mother is an engineering professor at the University of Toronto. Acting was an unlikely path for Jiao to take.
“To be doing something in the entertainment industry is definitely non-traditional,” she said.
Yet according to Jiao, her parents did not deter her from acting and were willing to pay for her acting lessons on the condition that she stayed on top of her schoolwork.
“They were strict in the sense that school came first, but they were just as excited as I was,” Jiao said. “They drove me to all my classes and auditions and they were just incredibly supportive.”
Jiao recounts memories of her mother helping her rehearse before auditions, as Jiao practiced her lines while her mother read the rest of the script.“I was extremely lucky in that sense,” Jiao said.
Jiao took lessons at Armstrong Acting Studios in Toronto, where Miley Cyrus had also studied a few years earlier. The workshops focused on preparing her for auditions, but she was unsuccessful for the first two years.
Then came Degrassi. Jiao advanced through several callbacks and was asked to do a screen test­—the final round of the audition process where she performed her lines with makeup and costume. Going into the screen test, Jiao knew the decision was down to her and one other individual.
“My agent called me and told me she had terrible news, and it was the hardest thing she’d ever had to tell anyone,” Jiao said. “I was freaking out. And then she told me that I had booked Degrassi.”
ON THE SET
When Jiao landed the role, the producers reworked her character from Leia Bince, the character she had originally auditioned for, to Leia Chang. Jiao joined “Degrassi: The Next Generation” in its eighth season, which began filming in April 2008.
For Jiao, a day on set would involve getting up as early as 5:30 a.m. for her parents to drive her to the studio, also in Toronto. Hair and makeup preparation took about an hour, during which she would review any last-minute changes to the script.
For each scene, the actors went through blocking, rehearsals, and shooting, working on about eight scenes in a 12-hour workday. Interspersed throughout the process were hours for homework, meals, and socializing with the rest of the cast.
“It’s a very laborious process, actually,” she said.
At first, Jiao said she found it difficult to play Leia, who was meant to be dominant, gossipy, and a pathological liar. Jiao, on the other hand, came on set timid and inexperienced. Though she gained confidence in portraying Leia, Jiao said the writers made Leia’s insecure side more visible to better fit her personality.
“I was way too quiet—not insecure, but too scared to meet new people and be outgoing,” Jiao said. “Degrassi definitely changed that because I was forced to meet new people everyday—new directors, new producers, new writers.”
In her second episode on Degrassi, Leia goes to a party with her friend Mia Jones, but leaves when alcohol and sex are involved. Later, she discovers that Mia slept with a man to further her modeling career, and must decide how that will affect their friendship.
Such dilemmas are typical of the experiences portrayed in Degrassi, which has dealt with issues such as teenage pregnancy, gang violence, and sexual identity. Jiao said the show is known for discussing controversial subjects, but also offers a positive message on overcoming challenges.
“I certainly knew people in high school who had issues with drug abuse, who had issues at home, who dealt with relationship problems and who had insecurities,” Jiao said. “I think in that sense, Degrassi was really able to resonate with a far-reaching audience of people.”
MEETING DRAKE
Although Jiao received inspiration from her high school classmates, she also chose not to inform most of them about her acting role. Jiao said she did not want too many people to know about her new lifestyle, and only told a few of her closest friends, who helped her catch up on material she missed in school while filming.
Jiao was constantly meeting new people in the studio, becoming close friends with Charlotte Arnold and Annie Clark, who play Holly J. Sinclair and Fiona Coyne. Jiao said she continues to visit them every time she returns home.
Soon after she started filming, one of Degrassi’s former actors, Aubrey Drake Graham, visited the studio and met with Jiao. Graham played Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi before leaving to pursue his music career under the stage name Drake.
“He was incredibly nice—very, very sweet guy, very down-to-earth,” Jiao said.
Just as Drake had moved on from acting to music, Jiao decided she would no longer act with Degrassi when she was accepted to Harvard. Although other cast members have attended college while continuing to appear on the show, Jiao decided to focus on her college experience.
“I miss acting a lot, and it was a really big part of my life. There is definitely a creative side to me that needs to be expressed,” Jiao said.
MOVING ON
Jiao is a psychology concentrator from Lowell House, just as fellow thespian Natalie Portman ’03 was a decade earlier. Last summer, as the 11th season of Degrassi was being filmed, Jiao participated in a study abroad program in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Oxford University, Queens College led by Harvard lecturer Andrew Berry.
Jiao said she hopes to go to Oxford for business school. As a business associate for Harvard Undergraduate Television, she combines this interest with her experience in entertainment. Jiao is uncertain if she will ever return to acting, which she said is both a competitive and volatile industry.
Still, Jiao credits her experience on Degrassi with providing her with unique opportunities and helping her gain confidence in herself. Through a difficult audition process, Jiao said she learned to deal with rejection and negative feedback.
“I think that’s definitely a very applicable skill to possess for the future,” she said.
Jiao said she often thinks back to the day she first considered acting. “If I had not been shopping that day, my life would be completely different,” she said. “There are so many experiences I was able to have through Degrassi.”
“It’s weird how life works like that sometimes. These chance encounters will set you on a completely different course for the rest of your life,” she added.

Organizers of Occupy Harvard have installed a metal dome that they may weatherize in coming weeks and point to the construction as symbolic of their intent to outlast the winter.
Rising above the tents in Occupy Harvard’s camp in the Yard, the dome’s frame was constructed over Thanksgiving break by a group of Harvard affiliates, and may be weatherized in the coming weeks to provide a more protected space that will survive the winter, the occupiers said.
“I think there’s an understanding that we’re here [in the long term] and that the dome will be a central part of that,” said Kavi Bhalla, a Harvard research scientist and tutor in Pforzheimer House who was involved with the installation of the dome. “I think it’s very much a symbol of permanence.”
The occupiers are currently considering a number of different methods to transform the frame into a shelter, including installing a plastic skin that would waterproof the dome and additional insulation to keep it warm, according to Bhalla.Another option includes turning the dome into a green house that would be heated by natural light. This approach would allow the walls of the dome to be transparent while maintaining warmth even in five-degree weather, said Timothy S. McGrath, a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The dome’s future is largely dependent on who decides to carry the plans forward. “We’re sort of waiting to see who jumps in and gets it started,” Bhalla said.
McGrath said that dome, which is 18 feet in diameter, could serve as the hub of the Occupy encampment.
“For me personally, the dome can be a universal space that can help sustain the occupation,” McGrath said. “I picture the dome being a community center [to spread the message] with or without the camp.”
While the future of Occupy Harvard remains unclear, protesters say that the dome is an important symbol of the movement’s intention to establish a lasting presence.
A group of Massachusetts Institute Technology affiliates donated the parts of the dome at the start of Occupy Harvard, but protesters waited until after Thanksgiving break to install it. The occupiers hoped that the dome would attract new attention to the movement, according to Bhalla.
“We love the dome,” he said. “For us, it’s a symbol of solidarity of MIT for us.”
The Occupy Boston movement is also in the process of winterizing its encampment in Dewey Square. A group of Harvard and MIT students led by MIT architecture Professor Jan W. Wampler has suggested potential solutions, which the movement is currently considering.
“My understanding is that the Occupy Boston people would like to stay there during the winter, and we’re trying to help them,” said Wampler. “But I think what we’re also trying to do is change the image.”
Wampler said he believes Occupy could benefit from a makeover that would include the creation of “more beautiful” structures that better convey a sense of permanence than tents.

Women’s organizations, rather than democratic regimes, will best enable Arab women to achieve greater gender equality, a leader of Oxfam International said at a lecture on Tuesday.
Magda Mohammed El Sanousi Omer, the Oxfam Great Britain country director in Beirut, Lebanon, provided context for her argument by citing the strategies of women’s movements for equality in the Middle East.
Omer said that in the past, rights-based organizations have made strides, especially in changing legislation to provide more rights for women, such as enabling paid maternity leaves in some countries.
But due to the recent group of uprisings in the Middle East known as the Arab Spring, Omer proposed that women now need to find different strategies to effect change.
Political instability would offer new opportunities, Omer said, but also new hurdles.
“Every day there is a new change and we don’t know for how long,” she said at the event, pointing to the growing number of political parties in the Middle East.
“Nothing is institutionalized. Government changes all the time,” she added.
Omer credits media outlets for making women’s involvement in the Arab Spring protests more visible on the international front.
“That was so inspiring for the whole world,” she said. “There’s a new young generation emerging and beginning to demand more.”
Omer then suggested ways that women today could achieve greater equality.
She said that Arab women should open up their movements, becoming more inclusive to other groups.
One challenge to the success of gender equality, Omer said, was that Arab women were not settled on one common agenda for change, which hindered the potential for results.
Omer recommended bridging the gender gap by educating women on “new skills and ideas, such as social justice, monitoring budgets, and policy statements, in order to enhance their voices and [give them] the capacity to demand for change.”
Omer said that by increasing political participation, women would gain more rights.
She also said she remains hopeful that women will gain more influence in the Middle East.
The Arab Spring provided a window of opportunity, Omer said, but Arab women must take action before the window closes.
“If you want to get a share of the cake, don’t wait,” Omer said, “If you wait, you will lose.”
“I’m thrilled with what she said about what women can do to keep the momentum going following the Arab Spring,” said Susan M. Kahn, the associate director for Middle Eastern studies.
“I’m delighted that she discussed it in such a concrete way.”

Increasing coordination between European Union member states and other countries will create a stronger future for the EU, said Richard C. Wright, former ambassador and head of the European Commission’s delegation to Russia, during a talk at the Center for European Studies Tuesday.
Wright focused on the EU’s foreign policy during his lecture, saying that its lack of unity hinders its ability to fulfill its potential as a major world player.
“There is no doubt that the EU currently punches below its weight. The whole is much less than the sum of its parts,” said Wright, who is currently a fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and the Director for Conflict Prevention and Security Policy at the European External Action Service.
Wright said the recent vote on Palestine’s admission to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization revealed an “embarrassing” disunity of EU member states, as France voted for admission, Germany voted against, and England abstained.
The EU’s Common Foreign and Security Policy leads to ambiguity between the official EU stance and the policies of individual member states.
“The question is ‘How common is common?’ The word common doesn’t mean united,” Wright said.
The need for coordination applies to the EU’s relations with other countries as well, he said.
By joint strategizing through regular, institutionalized meetings and consultations, the US and the EU can improve their international crisis management, leading to more positive outcomes, he said.
“We can do a lot more together,” he said.
About 25 people attended the talk, titled “The Interaction of the EU’s Common Foreign Security Policy and National Foreign Policy: The Case of Cooperation with the US.”

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health recently published evidence linking coffee with a decrease in risk of developing endometrial cancer after observing that women who drank more than four cups of coffee per day over the course of many years were less likely to develop cancer in the lining of their uterus.
These results follow a series of studies released in recent years indicating that coffee may have a number of long-term health benefits including decreased risk of Parkinson’s disease, depression, and type 2 diabetes.
Researchers examined cumulative coffee intake in relation to endometrial cancer in 67,470 women between the ages of 34 and 59. Over the course of 26 years, they documented 672 cases of endometrial cancer among the participants.
The researchers found that drinking more than four cups of coffee per day was linked with a 25 percent reduced risk for endometrial cancer and that drinking between two and three cups per day was linked with a 7 percent reduced risk.
The results may stem from the fact that coffee appears to reduce insulin levels and free estrogen levels, which are both risk factors associated with endometrial cancer, according to Edward L. Giovannucci ’80, lead author of the study and a professor at the School of Public Health.
A similar link was seen in decaffeinated coffee, where drinking more than two cups per day was linked with a 22 percent reduced risk for endometrial cancer, according to Giovannucci.
Giovannucci said that he would not recommend that women drink more coffee solely to lower the risk of endometrial cancer.
“However, women consuming coffee should feel some reassurance that coffee in general is not a harmful substance, and may even offer some health benefits,” Giovannucci said.
Researchers warn that drinking too much caffeine, or using substantial sugar and cream with the coffee, may offset any health benefits.
The added calories and fat could contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance.
“While coffee may play a role, maintaining a normal body weight and being physically active are most important,” Giovannucci said.
Other experts in the field said that coffee-drinking may be associated with other behaviors that would lead to reduced cancer risk.
“Maybe caffeine drinkers are also smokers or have a lower BMI ... both of which would contribute to lower risk of endometrial cancer,” Elena S. Ratner, assistant professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at the Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email.
Coffee-drinkers might also forgo other, more harmful beverages.
“Maybe women who drink lots of coffee are not drinking sugared beverages that lead to weight gain,” Thomas J. Herzog, director of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology at Columbia University, wrote in an email.
“I hope this study will lead to further inquiries about the effect of coffee on cancer because in this and similar studies, coffee intake is self-selected and not randomized,” said Giovannucci.

Harvard rolled out a new travel tool on Monday that will allow the University to better aid students who might be in danger while traveling abroad.
Students whose travel is funded by the University will now be required to submit their travel plans to the Harvard Travel Registry. Students who are travelling without Harvard funding also are welcome to register, but are not required to do so.
“The University has been enhancing its overseas emergency response capabilities, and the Harvard Travel Registry provides a new tool that makes it easier for faculty, students and staff to register their Harvard-related travel abroad,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email.
Many students said that the new tool is a welcome addition in planning their travels.
“We lose nothing from registering, and could potentially benefit a lot in case something happened,” said Imane Karroumi ’14, who is from Morocco. “Harvard alumni are everywhere and they could be a great resource in case of an emergency.”
Karroumi said she would appreciate Harvard’s help in the case of an emergency while she was at home because she does not have her own contingency plan.
The new requirement raises questions about student privacy and the University’s oversight when students are away from campus. However, students said they felt that the benefits of having Harvard’s support outweigh any potential infringements on their privacy.
Max Y. Lu ’15, who plans to visit China during winter break, said, “it is not an invasion of privacy. You never know when things could go wrong. It’s always good to have a back-up.”
Lu said that he does not have his own emergency plan and would turn to Harvard if trouble arose in China.
“I really just feel as though Harvard has every right as to inquire about what their money is paying for,” said Lisa S. Burricks ’15, who is planning to travel to Korea and Tunisia during the summer. “It is completely justifiable.”
The Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs first developed a program to help students in trouble overseas in 2006, according to Galvin.
The Registry is monitored by the recently-created Global Support Services department, which works closely with Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez.
The Global Support Services currently monitor events overseas that may impact Harvard affiliates, according to Galvin. “In an emergency situation, Global Support Services will act as the liaison between Harvard Schools and outside emergency and logistical resources,” Galvin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The editor-in-chief of the popular Ivy League gossip blog, IvyGate, is stepping down from his position. The site has seen a marked decline in the frequency of new postings in the last two months.
Peter Finocchiaro, a 2010 Cornell graduate, currently writes for Salon.com and was named editor-in-chief of IvyGate in October 2010.
IvyGate, founded in 2006, is owned and founded by Columbia graduates Christopher Beam and Nick Summers, journalists and former writers for the Columbia Daily Spectator. Beam and Summers will continue overseeing the site.
Stories for IvyGate primarily come from tips from students and daily publications from the Ivy League schools, according to Summers.
“We felt there was enough tabloid-worthy stuff occurring at Ivy League schools that there really needed to be a news and gossip source devoted to them exclusively,” Summers said.
IvyGate, once updated daily, published 14 blog posts in October and has published nine posts so far this month, a decline from 45 posts in September. With the exception of one post on Nov. 29, all stories this month were published between Nov. 11 and 19, an unusually long stretch of time without new content.
Six writers have contributed to IvyGate since the beginning of September. Of these, two have published more than four times.
Finocchiaro wrote 35 of the 45 stories published in September.
“At a certain point my responsibilities ratcheted up,” Finocchiaro said. “In October, I told Nick that I was planning on stepping down. I’m in the process of finding a replacement.”
“If I could keep the site populated with more content, I would,” he added.
Since its inception, the frequency of content published on IvyGate  has been inconsistent. “IvyGate goes through these sorts of waves where it becomes super active, and it goes through lulls,” said Zachary A. Ozer, the site’s business and technology director. “It sort of falls on whoever is in charge.”
Finocchiaro said there is always more than enough fodder for his small team of writers.
“I don’t think it’s ever too difficult to get the volume where it needs to be for a website like IvyGate,” he said, referring to its tabloid-like content.
“What we see is that IvyGate will continue to be a place where aspiring writers can go, learn how to write journalism with a satirical edge,” Ozer said. “If it becomes something more, great. If not, it continues to be a space where people can hone their skills.”
Though he founded IvyGate, Summers is critical of its readership.
“Chris and I always describe it as 10 percent love and 90 percent hatred for Ivy League students,” he said. “It’s about the worst caliber of people you can imagine as an audience.”
“You get lots of sorts of mean spirited tips from people who want to put a story on their rivals. ... It’s people at their worst,” Summers added.
Finocchiaro agreed, citing its snarky content as its main appeal to readers. Neither Summers nor Finocchiaro see an end to IvyGate.
“It’s always been a site that’s generated a lot of traffic, and I don’t think that’s going to change,” Finocchiaro said.

A new online start-up aims to change the way classes are taught.
Coursekit, launched on Tuesday as a free download, is an online course management website that aims to combine the functions of a course site with the interaction of a social networking site.
The site­—founded by three students at the University of Pennsylvania—has features similar to most course websites: a syllabus, a schedule, and online documents. But it is easier to use, according to William N. Forster ’13, an on-campus representative of the site.
”It takes a liability that you had to deal with and makes it something positive, both from the professor’s side and from the student’s side,” Forster said.
Forster, along with Colm Dubhrosa ’13 and Kate A. Abraham ’14, is a campus founder, a student recruited to introduce the site on college campuses.
Accompanying the traditional course website components are elements resembling Facebook: a stream similar to a newsfeed where students and teachers can post information related to the class, in addition to profiles for each class participant.
But rather than recollecting Friday night’s antics, students and teachers on Coursekit can discuss topics related to their course and post relevant links to enhance the learning experience.
This turns the class into a continuous experience, rather than a biweekly occurrence, according to Coursekit co-founder and CEO Joseph Cohen.
Proponents of the website say students and professors alike have been critical of existing course websites.
“A lot of professors we have talked to say iSites is very difficult to use from the professor side,” Forster said. “Coursekit is a much nicer design and is much more convenient than iSites.”
Several Harvard professors are currently using the site, and more will try it next semester.  After that, Harvard’s campus founders say they will work with the administration to expand the use of Coursekit on campus.
Despite possibly coordinating with the administration, Cohen says Coursekit does not aim for institutional sales and instead focuses on individual instructors who can tailor the site for their own use.
The site has already been piloted at 30 universities nationwide and the company hopes to extend to more in the future.
Said Cohen, “We’ve seen people make friends, we’ve seen them get to know each other, we’ve seen people learn things that they never would have without Coursekit and that to us is what it’s about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Orinoco, a Venezuelan eatery with locations in Brookline and Boston’s South End, will be coming to Harvard Square early next year, replacing Small Plates, a Spanish restaurant, at 56 JFK St.
The menu contains a mix of traditional culinary items from Latin America, including the Andean and Caribbean regions. Options include a selection of Venezuelan sandwiches that can contain meat or vegetables.
A popular item, according to owner Andres Branger, is the arepa—a grilled corn pocket sandwich that is stuffed with shredded beef, pork, and exotic cheeses imported from Venezuela. The price ranges from $4.50 to $6.
In addition to sandwiches, the menu also includes options commonly found at high-end restaurants, including beef tenderloin.
Branger, who is from Venezuela, ensures that prices are low by purchasing his own ingredients, many of which are imported from his home country. All menu options are priced at less than $19.
The 1000-square-foot location in Harvard Square seats 50. Branger also negotiated with the landlord of the space to use the private garden in the back that will seat 20. Branger said he envisions the space being used for private events. The space is currently under construction and will include French doors, a surrounding fence, and fieldstones to provide an intimate setting.
“In each of our spaces, we really borrow from the infrastructure there. This area will allow guests to be set back from the busy energy of the street,” Branger said.
The other locations are also small in square-footage to offer an intimate, cozy feel that calls to the restaurant’s concept of traditional cuisine.
“We want to feel like you’re eating in somebody’s home,” Branger said.
Similar to the other restaurants, the location will have an assortment of different kinds of chairs, plates, and Venezuelan décor.
The Harvard Square location was previously the home to another Spanish restaurant, Iruña, which Branger often visited as a student at Boston University from 1979 to 1984.
“It was the only Spanish/Latin American restaurant in the area that existed when I was in college,” Branger said.
Branger had been looking at locations in Harvard Square for a year and said when the space opened up, he saw it as an omen. Branger secured the space last June and has been since working to upgrade the basic infrastructure of the space.
Branger opened the first location in the South End six years ago. After college, he worked at various financial institutions, with his last job at a start-up dot-com company.
“I decided I was going to live my dream and open a Latin American restaurant,” Branger said.
Branger devoted himself to the project and sold his house, sleeping on a friend’s couch until he opened the first restaurant.
The restaurant owner said he is excited to open another location in Harvard Square and plans to become a part of the community by supporting local non-profit organizations.
“We’re a neighborhood eatery, and we want to become a part of the community,” Branger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard hockey star Louis Leblanc will make his NHL debut in Anahiem, Calif. Wednesday, skating for his hometown team, the Montreal Canadiens. The Habs called up Leblanc from the AHL’s Hamilton Bulldogs to fill the space left by Max Pacioretty, who earned a three-game suspension for a dirty hit.
Leblanc—a former member of the class of 2013—had made a name for himself before stepping foot on campus in fall of 2009, as the Canadiens had taken Leblanc in the first round with the 18th overall pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft.
And the forward lived up to the hype. Skating for the Crimson during his freshman year, Leblanc established himself as a force in the Harvard attack. Named Ivy League Rookie of the Year and a finalist for ECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year, Leblanc led the Crimson in points and goals in the 2009-2010 campaign.
But after his stellar rookie season, the rising sophomore—in an unprecedented move—chose to leave Cambridge with hopes of making the NHL. His three-year contract with the Canadiens signaled the end of his time in a Harvard jersey. Shortly thereafter, the Montreal native helped Canada finish second in the 2011 World Junior Championship.
On Oct. 27, Leblanc made his professional debut for the Bulldogs in a matchup against the Rochester Americans and Alex Biega ’10, another former Crimson stalwart.
Leblanc and the Canadiens will take the ice against the Ducks at 7 p.m. local time.

Although the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team came out on top of the tightly contested Ivy League scrimmages two weeks ago, the Crimson remains largely untested in regular season play, having claimed a 9-0 victory over No. 10 Williams in its lone match of the year so far.
But Wednesday, all of that might change, as Harvard begins Ivy League play with a trip to Hanover, N.H., to take on No. 7 Dartmouth (3-0) and No. 14 Middlebury (0-2).
“We saw Dartmouth at Ivy scrimmages, and they’re a tough team, especially in the top four,” said freshman Nick Hopcroft, who played at the No. 4 spot in the Crimson’s first match. “There should be tough matches, but we’re confident we can pull off another victory. We’re hoping to pick up where we left off against Williams.”
Harvard will play six matches this weekend after it returns from its journey up north.
But the matchup against the Big Green will likely be the toughest competition Harvard sees until January, when the season resumes after a short recess that begins during reading period.
“I think this is a great way to hit the ground running with the season,” sophomore Tommy Mullaney said. “We have a pretty intense string of matches come January and February. [This weekend] is a good way for us to get used to the rapid-fire match play we’re going to see later in the season.”
At last year’s CSA Team Championships, Ivy League schools claimed five of the top seven rankings in the nation. And along with Trinity and Rochester—which placed first and third, respectively, at last year’s team championships—Ancient Eight teams look poised to claim many of the top spots again this year.
“The Ivy League is definitely very strong,” freshman Julian Kirby said. “Every individual match is going to be tough [against Ancient Eight teams]. No one is going to be blowing anyone off the court. We need to make sure we’re fit enough to last through long matches and win them, and have that mental edge to come home with the last few points.”
Dartmouth opened the 2011-12 campaign with a solid performance at this year’s Ivy Scrimmages, earning wins against Columbia and No. 9 Penn after dropping its opening round matchup against No. 6 Cornell, 7-2.
“Dartmouth looked pretty strong at [the scrimmages],” Kirby said. “They gave Cornell a pretty decent match. … We feel like we’re the better team, but we’re not complacent.”
Harvard had success against the Big Green last year, taking down its Ancient Eight foe by a score of 7-2 in regular-season play.
All seven of the Crimson’s individual victories last year came from underclassmen, led by then-freshmen Gary Power and Brandon McLaughlin.
The duo took down its Dartmouth opponents, 3-2, and, 3-0, respectively. Sophomore Nigel Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, and juniors Alexander Ma and Zeke Scherl also swept their matches last year. The two teams met again in the consolation round of the CSA Team Championships, and Harvard came out on top, this time earning eight individual victories.
Dartmouth is undefeated in regular season play thus far. The Big Green earned its third straight victory of the young season, 5-4, in a tightly contested matchup against No. 8 Franklin and Marshall.
The Panthers dropped their first two contests of the year, but should not be taken lightly. Middlebury opens the season with one of the toughest schedules in the nation, taking on three top-10 teams—the Big Red, No. 3 Princeton, and the Crimson—in its first three matches of the year.
“Middlebury is ranked lower [than Dartmouth], and obviously we’re hoping to beat them as well,” Hopcroft said. “We’re pretty confident. … We just need to make sure we concentrate the whole match and get the job done. We can’t go into it half-hearted.”
This weekend, Harvard will close out a hectic week of eight matches in just five days, with contests against NYU, Amherst, MIT, Boston College, Northeastern, and Boston University.
“[This weekend] will be a great chance for the guys who aren’t on the team all the time to get a game in,” Hopcroft said. “And the more matches you play, the better, really. It’s going to be a busy weekend, and we’ll be tired, but it’s good for us [and] good preparation for the [rest of the] season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Dave Wakulich ’11 was a trying out for the Canadian Junior National Team, a rower on the senior national squad, Malcolm Howard ’05, wanted to help him out.
“He offered to house me during a training camp in 2007,” Wakulich wrote in an e-mail. “He became my inside man.”
On Nov. 17, the two were selected for the Men’s Eight Group at Canada’s Olympic Training Camp and are now training in Victoria, B.C., with the goal of making the men’s eight for the 2012 Olympics.
“It’s a huge honor to get invited,” Howard said.
“Being an Olympian is something I’ve aspired to become since my early teenage years,” Wakulich wrote. “I’m simply one step closer now. I don’t feel much different and the mission is the same—get jacked and get fast!”
Howard’s invitation was hardly a surprise.
A three-time national champion with the Crimson, Howard won a gold medal in the eight at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was most recently a member of the Canadian eight that took bronze at the 2011 World Rowing Championships, held in Bled, Slovenia.
“He has tremendous drive—clearly very, very highly motivated,” Harvard coach Harry Parker said.
“His mentality and physicality are inspiring,” Wakulich wrote. “A lot of guys on the squad at school and here at the training center look up to him and his accomplishments. I would feel gratified to instill in any Harvard rower, or person in general, what Malcolm has in me. As one of Harvard`s very few Gold Medal winning Olympians he has become the benchmark for not only Harvard Crew but Harvard Athletics [sic].”
According to Parker, Howard has excelled since before his college days.
“Both [Howard and Wakulich are] very powerful, very fit athletes,” he said. “Malcolm actually came to us that way and just kept developing and getting stronger and fitter every year.”
For Wakulich, the road was a little windier.
“He was hampered for the first year and a half by injuries, by difficulty with his knee—very limited training, not much chance to develop technically,” Parker said. “He made some very significant strides in both his junior and senior years.”
After graduating as the school’s 2k record-holder, Wakulich got his foot in the door of the Canadian national team following a fourth-place finish at this summer’s U23 World Championships.
“I received an invitation to try out for the Pan American squad,” he said. “I was seeking as much international racing experience as possible, so I figured I would give it a shot. I showed up for tryouts and seat-raced my way into both the four and the eight.”
Both the Canadian four and eight took silver at the Pan American Games, which took place in Ciudad Guzman, Mexico.
“It was a huge spectacle and an experience I will never forget,” Wakulich wrote. “I learned a lot about racing and competition in general. All of the races were extremely close but we were not able to come out on top, which was disappointing. More fuel for the fire, though, right?”
His summer and fall successes proved enough to earn him the invite to the 2012 Olympics, which will be held in London.
“It seems quite apparent that he has continued to develop physically and technically,” Parker said. “I think it’s quite an achievement for him to be included in the eights group.”
“I’m excited to have Dave here,” Howard said. “He brings a really good work ethic; he brings a really great attitude. He wants to be here, and he wants to do whatever he can to help improve the team.”
Boat announcements are off in the distance. For now, Howard, Wakulich, and the rest of the athletes are focused on the long winter training months that lie ahead.
“We’re both excited to put in the miles,” Howard said. “Medals are awarded in the summer, but they’re won in the winter.”
“Our national team training program has been a bit of a shock to the system, but one I expected,” Wakulich wrote. “Rowing is my job now and let’s just say I no longer have American collegiate sport organizations limiting how many hours a day or per week I’m allowed to work out.”
Whatever the outcome of the months ahead, Parker notes that their accomplishments to this point have brought joy to Newell Boathouse.
“We all must take a great deal of pride in their achievements, both the coaches and the oarsmen,” Parker said. “We’re very proud of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three straight losses at home, the Harvard women’s hockey team (5-4, 5-2 ECAC) is ready for a change in scenery and a chance to regain its early-season momentum. A rematch against conference rival Dartmouth (5-4-1, 4-2-1) Wednesday could be the perfect opportunity.
The Crimson and the Big Green were pitted against each other for the first time last week, with Dartmouth pulling off a 3-2 upset at Bright Hockey Center. The loss against the Big Green was quickly followed by back-to-back losses to No. 2 Minnesota—2-1 and 7-3, respectively—which dropped Harvard from the national rankings.
The trio of losses tarnished the winning record of a previously one-loss team that was riding a two-game winning streak and ranked No. 9 in the nation.
“We’re coming off a tough three losses … and we hate losing,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey said. “We want to learn from the mistakes we made playing against [Dartmouth and Minnesota], but we’re ready to play.”
The Big Green, which leads the Crimson 41-35-2 in the series history, enters tonight’s contest unranked, marking the first time that both squads meet with neither being nationally ranked.
Though unranked, both squads are expected to make an impact in the ECAC, with the Crimson finishing second in the preseason coaches’ poll and the Big Green taking fourth.
Dartmouth has already proven its prowess in the conference with a 5-4 upset over Cornell–which was the first-place pick in the coaches’ poll–on Nov. 11.
Harvard, meanwhile, fell, 5-3, to its Ivy League opponent.
Despite the losing streak that has defined the last week of play, the Crimson still feels confident in its ability to win against its Big Green counterpart.
“We have a lot of motivation to get this game [tonight],” junior defender Josephine Pucci said. “Dartmouth is doing pretty well right now and has won the last couple of games, but we’re ready to get the win. Last week didn’t go the way we had hoped, but we’re capable of a lot more.”
“We’re fired up … and we’re going in with a chip on our shoulder,” Dempsey added. “We’re taking what we can from the losses, both good and bad, but the losses are definitely motivating us to come out harder.”
In its loss against Dartmouth, Harvard had no trouble getting on the board, scoring less than a minute after the opening faceoff. Dempsey and Pucci combined to fire a shot on goal, and sophomore Lyndsey Fry capitalized on the deflection, putting the Crimson ahead just 39 seconds into the match. Harvard was also able to find the back of the net at the end of game, when Dempsey fired a shot to pull the Crimson within one in the final minute of the match.
The Crimson proved itself on the bookends of the matchup, but could not find consistency in the 58 minutes between the goals, during which Dartmouth scored three times.
But last Wednesday was not the first, or the most heartbreaking time, the Big Green pulled an upset over the Crimson.
Last season, despite beating Dartmouth in both regular season games, 5-3 and 3-2, Harvard fell to the Big Green, 4-1, in the ECAC semifinal at home.
Dartmouth went on to advance to the championship match against Cornell, which it lost, 3-0.
After holding Minnesota to only two goals in the squads’ first matchup, the Crimson defense allowed seven the following night. Harvard goaltender Laura Bellamy recorded 29 saves in the match on Friday, followed by an 18-save performance on Saturday.
“The losses [against Minnesota] are tough to swallow, but we’re not looking back,” Dempsey said.
Following the consecutive defeats, the Crimson has to find a way to become more consistent if it hopes to win against Dartmouth tonight on the road.
“We’re recognizing what it takes to get back on the winning track,” Pucci said. “We need to focus on the little things … because what matters is whether you execute and bring everything you have to the game.”
“One thing for sure is that we’re going to have to come out for the full 60 minutes.” Dempsey echoed. “It’s all about how we play. We’ve studied the tendencies of [Dartmouth], but what it comes down to is what we bring to the rink.”

One of hip-hop's most influential figures will be trading in his rhymes for a more traditional presentation tomorrow afternoon. The Black Men's Forum will host a lecture by rap legend and Wu-Tang Clan co-founder GZA (pronounced jizza for those who aren't down with the Wu). He will speak about his career, influences, and songwriting techniques on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in Science Center D.
The famed songwriter, who is also known as The Genius, Maximillion, The Head, and Allah Justice, will be making his first trip back to Harvard since the spring of 2008, when he and the rest of Wu-Tang performed at Yardfest.
The visit to Harvard seems appropriate for an artist renowned for his intellectual and socially aware lyrics. Since Wu-Tang Clan released its first album in 1993, The Genius has won fans with his rapid wordplay and vocabulary that rivals Harvard's best.
"A lot of us listen to hip-hop for enjoyment," said Damilare K. Sonoiki '13, the president of BMF and an inactive Crimson news writer. "We also thought it would be interesting to approach it from an academic perspective."
GZA will continue his tour of the academic circuit with visits to MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute and the MIT Media Lab.

Robert K. Nishihara '13 and Yiren Lu '13 are on a mission. The two math concentrators and Adams House residents are attempting to empower students to improve their social skills.
And like any smart revolutionaries, they're using the web. In October, Nishihara and Lu founded idontdateathletes.com, a blog offering advice on handling social situations. Although their backgrounds would cause many to write off the two as anti-social, they said that they feel their experiences give them a unique perspective on improving social behavior.
"It's really ironic that two math majors are writing a blog on social skills, because math and science majors are generally the nerdy, anti-social crowd," Nishihara said. "It's not that we have exceptional social skills. If you asked her or me, it's that we've gone through the process of acquiring social skills."
While Nishihara said that he would love to reach as large an audience as possible, he also said the main goal of his blog is simply education.
"I want everyone to know that you can constantly improve yourself in every aspect of life—academically, physically, socially, morally, etc.," Nishihara said. "You should constantly strive to be better."
