After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 13, 2015, at 10:31 p.m.
Robert C. Meisner, a clinical fellow in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Harvard Medical School graduate, has been appointed Currier House’s acting dean. Meisner will fill the post that former dean Laura K. Johnson vacated at the end of the fall semester for a position at Boston University's School of Education.
Meisner completed his undergraduate studies at Princeton and later studied cultural anthropology as a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard. During that time, he also wrote for Harvard Student Agencies’ “Let’s Go” travel guide in Bolivia.
Currier House Masters Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross informed Currier affiliates of Meisner’s appointment in an email late last week.
Meisner, who is also a former Dunster House resident tutor and graduated from the Medical School in 2008, expressed excitement for the role he will play in shaping Currier’s House life.
“The most exciting thing is the opportunity to work with extraordinary students and tutors in helping Currier continue to do the things that it’s done so well so far,” he said.
Wrangham and Johnson were unavailable to comment on the appointment because they are in Uganda with poor phone and internet service. But in their email to Currier residents, the pair wrote that they were “very excited” to announce Meisner’s appointment.
Although Meisner said the new role will mark his first official position in Currier, he said he has already noticed a unique and thriving House spirit there.
“I think there’s a lot of Quad-specific enthusiasm and energy that’s very exciting,” Meisner said.
He said that he has spent much of winter break studying the Administrative Board. Like deans in all the Houses, Meisner will serve on the College’s primary disciplinary body.
Shortly before undergraduates arrive back on campus, Meisner said he will introduce himself over email. Afterwards, he said he will meet with students in study breaks, House committee meetings, and other House-related events.
“Learning so many names all at once is going to be a challenge,” Meisner said, laughing, when prompted to describe a specific difficulty he might face.
“I’m really excited to work with all the students and staff at Currier, and look forward to an exciting semester,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The renovation of the Smith Campus Center will span three floors and feature a network of meeting rooms, common spaces, lockers, and express elevators when it opens in 2018, according to preliminary plans for the upcoming renovation.
While officials have detailed plans to host student government offices and fireplaces in the space and move several University offices to other locations to make room for the construction, the fate of several restaurants currently housed in the campus center building, formerly known as the Holyoke Center, still remains unclear.
The first, second, and 10th floors of the campus center building at 1350 Massachusetts Ave. will undergo construction as part of the project, according to Tanya Iatridis, the senior director of University planning who oversees the renovation. All proposed renovations must be approved by the city and the Cambridge Historical Commission, she said, meaning that plans are subject to change.
Officials hope the new campus center will be open at all hours, Iatridis said.
The campus center building’s renovation, announced in 2013, is slated to begin in the spring of 2016 and conclude in 2018, according to Iatridis. As part of the initial work into the building’s designs, the University prepared a survey and convened multiple working groups to discuss the renovation last year. Some of those groups were composed of mostly administrators and faculty while others were made up predominantly of undergraduate or graduate students.
Since that time, more than a dozen students who participated in initial working groups were invited to presentations, at least as early as November, that featured the floor plans and renditions of the renovated campus center, according to several attendees.
OUT WITH THE OLD
According to the preliminary plans, which Iatridis detailed in an interview, the campus center’s first floor will feature several restaurants and a large presentation area. Both the front plaza and back entrance will be redesigned and feature new landscaping.
The building will include lockers, which Iatridis said was a specific request of undergraduates who live in the Quad and students at Harvard’s campuses in Longwood. Details about the location and availability of the lockers have not yet been decided, according to Brigid O'Rourke, a spokesperson for University planning and community programs.
The second floor, meanwhile, will house lounge spaces, smaller meeting areas, and fireplaces, according to Iatridis. The space will also include separate offices for the Undergraduate Council and the Graduate Student Government, Iatridis said, and there are plans to transform an old bank vault on the second floor into a smaller meeting space for the organizations. A separate, larger space with a capacity of about 200 people could be used for meetings by the entire graduate and undergraduate student governments, she said.
Unused elevators near the campus center’s arcade area on the first floor will be converted to express elevators to lead Harvard affiliates directly to the building’s 10th floor, facing the river, according to Iatridis.
There, there will be lounge areas, conference rooms, and fireplaces, according to former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who saw preliminary plans for the project twice in November and sat on the common spaces working group that discussed the project.
Some areas of the renovated campus center will be off-limits to tourists, according to Mayopoulos and former UC representative Charles A. Scherr ’17, who viewed preliminary plans in November. The first floor and portions of the second floor will be open to the public, but only Harvard affiliates will have access to the 10th floor, O'Rourke wrote in an email.
Another feature of the space will include vitrines, or glass cases, to encase trees that Iatridis said will react to the changes in the seasons just as plants outside the building do.
“The challenge was to create spaces that are very, very flexible so the spaces can take a life of their own during the daytime, during the weekend, during the seasons,” Iatridis said, adding that another large focus of the proposed designs was to increase natural sunlight.
Officials have already made plans to relocate current University tenants of the campus center’s first, second, and 10th floors, according to O'Rourke.
Specifically, Harvard University Health Services’ pharmacy, currently housed on the campus center’s first floor, will relocate to UHS’s first floor area in the spring of 2016, O’Rourke wrote in an email. Several other campus center offices will relocate to 114 Mt. Auburn St., including Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, which is currently housed on the campus center’s 10th floor; Human Resources, which now sits on its sixth floor; and the Harvard Dental Service, which is currently located on the campus center’s first floor. The Center for Wellness, also now on the first floor, will move to 114 Mt. Auburn St. during construction.
The Harvard Box Office, meanwhile, will relocate from the campus center’s first floor to its eighth, according to O’Rourke, while the Office for Sponsored Programs will move from the sixth floor to 1033 Massachusetts Ave. Officials have yet to finalize a space for Harvard Real Estate offices, which are currently situated on the eighth floor, O'Rourke wrote.
RESTAURANTS STILL NEGOTIATING
The fate of restaurants that currently reside in the campus center building, such as Al’s Harvard Square Cafe and Oggi Gourmet Foods, is unclear. Iatridis said she expects the renovated Smith Center to include the same number of food options as it does now, if not more, but said she does not know which restaurants will ultimately stay there because she has not been involved in real estate negotiations with the shops, which each have their own leases.
Campus Services has been in contact with individual businesses regarding their leases, but “no final decisions have been made,” according to an emailed statement from Carolee Hill, the managing director of Harvard Real Estate. Hill declined to comment on the status of individual retail leases, citing the confidentiality of the agreements.
More than a month ago, the popular dessert shop Finale closed its location in the campus center building after 12 years of operation for reasons that one general manager for the company said she believed were related to the planned Smith Center renovations. Iatridis said she did not know the reason for the closing.
In particular, the future of Au Bon Pain, a restaurant that is currently situated on the right facade of the Smith Center, is uncertain. Several students—UC representative Samarth Gupta ’18, Scherr, Mayopoulos, and Sudipta Devanath, a Law School student and the current president of the GSG—said they saw renditions of the plans that included changes to the restaurant’s current outdoor seating area. Devanath and Mayopoulos said they did not know whether ABP will be included in the renovated campus center.
ABP’s vice president of marketing, Paula Doyle, declined to comment on the future status of the company’s campus center location, instead issuing an emailed statement referencing the company’s “ long standing relationship with Harvard.” Doyle did not provide further details and directed inquiries to Hill at Harvard, who directed inquiries to O'Rourke.
O'Rourke declined to comment further on the status of ABP.
The preliminary plans for the campus center are the result of more than a year of planning. While several students sat on the working groups that advised the changes, administrators have come under some criticism for soliciting what some undergraduates have called an unsatisfactory amount of student input.
Iatridis, for her part, refuted that perception in an interview. “To come under that kind of criticism...just amazes me because the students have been right there, and actually most of the design is a response to what people have said,” she said.
Iatridis said she will hold open houses on Jan. 26, 27, and 30 on the campus center’s second floor to show off the sketches to Harvard affiliates and go over the current architecture of the building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American literature professor emeritus Sacvan Bercovitch is best remembered not only as a revolutionary in his field, but for his warm and approachable character as well. Rafia Zafar, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, described walking along Cambridge Common and talking with Bercovitch as "one of the highlights of my intellectual life.”
Bercovitch, a leader in the field of American studies, died of cancer on Dec. 9. He was 81.
Bercovitch was born and raised in Montreal, Canada, but dedicated his research to the emerging field of American literature. During his five-decade career, Bercovitch specialized in early American works, focusing specifically in how values from New England Puritans are projected in the American identity, according to his curriculum vitae.
Bercovitch joined Harvard in 1983, taught in the English department and held a professorship of English and American Literature until 2000 and a professorship of American literature from 2000-2001, according to his CV. After his retirement, he continued to serve as editor of The Cambridge History of American Literature and was a research professor of American Literature. He also taught at the Extension School, according to the school’s website.
Colleagues remember Bercovitch as a brave and vibrant individual with an extremely memorable career.
“Professor Bercovitch left a deep impression on early American studies,” Divinity School professor David F. Holland said. “He pushed historians to pay more attention to literature and literary scholars to pay more attention to history.”
“He was generous, witty, and intellectually radiant,” said Zafar, who worked alongside Bercovitch in editing the Cambridge History of American Literature.
Those who knew Bercovitch also praised him for his academic bravery.
“He had the courage to make large claims. Certainly not every scholar agreed with those claims, but everyone has to deal with them,” Holland said.
Throughout his career, he received honors, fellowships, grant money, and other recognition from organizations including the Guggenheim Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Yale Center for American Studies.
Although he was highly decorated for his work, Bercovitch treated others with humility, Zafar said.
“Despite being a dominating figure in American literary history, [he was] an approachable mensch—there really is no other word for it,” Zafar said.
Bercovitch is survived by his wife, Susan, and two sons, Eytan and Sascha. His funeral service was held on Dec. 11 in Brookline, and Harvard plans to hold their own memorial service for the professor on April 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 13, 2015, at 10:54 p.m.
Outgoing Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, whose electoral career was suspended by her loss to Republican Charlie D. Baker ’79 in last fall’s gubernatorial election, may take a short-term fellowship at Harvard, according to a report in The Boston Globe.
On Dec. 22, Coakley, a Democrat, filed a disclosure with the State Ethics Commission, in which she said she was under consideration for a “short-term fellowship position” at an unspecified university in Massachusetts.
“I would assume the new position after I leave office,” she wrote in the disclosure.
The Globe, citing anonymous “people familiar with the plan” as sources, reported Monday that the school was Harvard.
Spokespeople from Coakley’s press office and Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government declined to confirm that Harvard is considering hiring Coakley as a fellow. University spokesperson Jeff Neal also declined to comment on the matter.
Coakley has served two terms as the state attorney general since her 2006 election. In 2010, after losing to Republican Scott Brown in a race for a seat in the U.S. Senate, Coakley handily won reelection as attorney general.
Deval L. Patrick ’78, who preceded Baker as governor, will be joining MIT as a visiting fellow this spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday afternoon, the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team extended its win streak to three by sweeping No. 10 Franklin and Marshall (5-4), 9-0, in a nonconference match in Lancaster, Pa. This was the first time this season that all nine players picked up victories for the Crimson.
Harvard (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) won its third match in three days after having picked up road victories on the weekend against No. 9 Princeton and No. 11 Penn.
Freshman Madhav Dhingra won from the No. 1 position for the Crimson, defeating Diplomat sophomore Abhishek Pradhan in four games. The victory was a bounce-back win for Dhingra, who had lost his previous four matches.
In the only other four-game match of the day, freshman Bradley Smith, playing from the third position, beat F&M junior Dylan Cunningham. The victory capped off a three-day stretch in which the Lancashire, England native won all three of his matches.
Dylan Murray defeated Diplomat Cole Osborne in a match-up of sophomores playing from the No. 2 positions. From the fourth position, sophomore Bryan Koh bested F&M co-captain Alex Arjoon. Freshmen David Ryan and Seif Eleinen made it four victories on the day for Crimson first-years.
Sophomore Devin McLaughlin beat Diplomat senior Brian Henry in a sixth position battle between two natives of the Philadelphia Main Line. Junior Matt Roberts picked up a victory from the seventh position over Diplomat freshman Michael Sorochev.
Co-captain Tyler Olson stayed undefeated for the season after besting F&M sophomore Gavan Hitchenor.  Olson, who finished last season with a 15-0 record, has not lost a match since February of his sophomore year.
This was the second all-time meeting between the Crimson and Diplomats. Harvard also won last year’s matchup, 9-0. Of the nine matches, only two went more than three games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (10-3, 1-0 Ivy) has flipped the script after consecutive road losses to start its winter break, winning three straight entering Wednesday’s tilt against Boston College (7-7, 0-3 ACC). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard takes on its crosstown rival in its penultimate non-conference matchup.

Clipped Wings: Although the Eagles are the traditional regional power, the Crimson has recently taken the upper hand in the rivalry. Harvard has beaten Boston College six straight times, most of which came in convincing fashion. The streak started with a 12-point Crimson win over the then-No.17 Eagles in 2009, and the closest margin of victory since then has been seven. Harvard won five straight games over Boston College by a combined 65-point margin before the rivals came to Cambridge last year, where Harvard put a 15-point pasting on the Eagles to kick off the New Year.
The cross-town dominance has coincided with a fall in the Boston College brand. The Eagles boast two quality NBA alumni in Milwaukee Bucks forward Jared Dudley and Oklahoma City super-sub Reggie Jackson, but the local product has suffered since their respective graduations. Since Harvard’s win in 2009, the Crimson has more wins in the NCAA Tournament (two) than the Eagles have appearances (one). After making March Madness seven times in the last decade, Boston College has gone just 33-63 over the last three years.
It is not surprising then that the Eagles are not flying as high as they once were. After opening conference play with a 23-point drubbing at the hand of Duke, Boston College has stayed competitive in consecutive close losses to Pittsburgh (61-60, OT) and Miami (60-56). Yet, Ken Pomeroy ranks the squad above each Ivy League team but Harvard and Yale, meaning that Amaker’s team will not take the Eagles lightly.
Turnover Issues: All season long, the Crimson has struggled to create space on offense. The emergence of sophomore sixth man Corbin Miller and improved three-point shooting of senior wing Wesley Saunders have alleviated some of these concerns, but turnovers continue to weigh down the offense. An inability to hold onto the ball was the culprit in a surprise early-season loss to Holy Cross, and the team has had more turnovers than assists six times in 13 games after doing so only seven times in 32 contests last year.
The main culprit is Siyani Chambers, whose turnover rate of 24.1 percent is by far the highest of any of the team’s principle ball handlers. Chambers offsets this with the second-highest assist rate on the team, but it helps explain his -3.6 net rating, the only negative number among players who have played at least 50 minutes this season. Amaker harps in every press conference on turnovers, a subject that is critical to the team’s guard-dominant offense.
Ill-Suited Defense: On the defensive end, Harvard appears well equipped to handle the Eagles. Boston College is an exceptionally poor shooting team, making just 44 percent of its shots and 30 percent of its threes. Top scorers Olivier Hanlan and Aaron Brown have put up points (31 a game between the two) but have been inefficient while doing so. Neither makes more than 45 percent of his attempts and Hanlan shoots just 27 percent from three, despite taking more than four a game. Against the Crimson, whose length has helped shut down opposing attacks all year, Hanlan and Brown will have to be significantly better than they have been so far for the Eagles to maintain a successful offense.
