After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A meeting last week between Pope Benedict XVI and leaders of the global Jewish community served to ease the tension between the two religions, caused by the Pope’s decision to reinstate four previously excommunicated bishops back into the Roman Catholic Church. In particular, the reinstatement of Bishop Richard Williamson has outraged Jewish leaders, who point to his public skepticism of the Holocaust as evidence of anti-Semitism. Many have called for the Pope to re-excommunicate Williamson from the church. While the Pope’s efforts to meet with Jewish leaders in order to explain his decision and improve communications between the two religious bodies are admirable, they are not adequate.The Pope’s decision is especially troubling considering his own involvement with the Hitler Youth in his teens. Although his membership within the organization was involuntary and unenthusiastic, Pope Benedict XVI has, nonetheless, faced criticisms surrounding this association since his election in 2005. As such, he should take the public perception of his actions into consideration before executing them. In this case, while the Pope may have meant for the reinstatement to help heal the growing rifts within the Catholic Church, it led to an unforeseen result: a serious objection by the international community. The Pope should have vetted Williamson more extensively, understanding the great weight of his decision to reinstate him and taking into account the offense to the Jewish community that such a choice would cause.Another troubling aspect of the Pope’s recent course of action is how it reflects a greater rightward movement of the church since Pope Benedict XVI’s election four years ago. While the Pope has made it a priority of his office to heal the schisms within the church, in doing so he has also brought an increased focus on fundamentalist beliefs and hostility toward other religions back to the Catholic Church. His desire to reunite the modern Roman Catholic Church with several more conservative factions, such as the Society of St. Pius X, of which Williamson is a member, along with his steadfast condemnation of birth control and homosexuality, reveals a troubling pattern of conservatism during his reign.While the reunification of the Catholic Church is a commendable goal, Pope Benedict XVI must be more prudent in his actions in the future. He needs to show good faith toward the global community and in the future should be far more thorough in picking his appointments within the church. Though his involvement in the Hitler Youth is certainly not an indicator of his current beliefs, the Pope must nonetheless be conscious of interfaith relations and how his past history colors the global perception of his actions. Though creating a united Roman Catholic Church is a worthy objective, it is hardly worth it if all other religions are alienated in the process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if the U.S. Army didn’t already have enough to worry about. Recent reports reveal that, in 2008, suicides by soldiers reached the highest level in nearly three decades. The epidemic extended evenly to all stages of the service: About 35 percent were soldiers who had never been deployed, 30 percent were those on active service—three quarters of them on their first tour of duty—and 35 percent took place after deployment, often more than a year after the soldier had returned home.
This increase in suicides reflects the larger problem of the army’s failure to fulfill the mental-health needs of troops.  An improvement of our nation’s military mental-health programs is long overdue—those who have chosen to serve our country deserve the same attention paid to their minds as to their bodies.
Though the U.S. military is already taking some necessary first steps to address the problem, they are not enough. Hiring 250 additional mental-health practitioners is a start, but even more should be hired and dispersed around the world where troops can access them. Should funding be an issue, money should be allocated from other programs. This is no area to cut costs; there is no higher priority than the health of our troops.
Before soldiers even don their uniforms, however, they should undergo a more intensive psychological screening as a preliminary test for the psychological toll of combat. Currently, applicants’ psychological backgrounds are evaluated by U.S. Army recruiters through an interview; it seems that an assessment of an applicants’ psychological background could be conducted by a more qualified individual. The U.S. Army’s role of defending the nation is extremely important, and filling our forces with men and women who are in top shape, not only physically, but also mentally, is of the utmost importance.
Soldiers already on the ground should also not be ignored. The repercussions of doing so resound beyond the individual—not only are suicides a tragic and often preventable phenomenon in themselves, but they also lower the morale of troops and the nation as a whole. As we fight two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, the need for high morale is clear. President Obama as commander-in-chief should work to implement higher-quality mental services into hospitals on the ground. The first place these services toward which these services should be directed is Afghanistan, since President Obama has been talking about sending more troops to assist in the fighting. 
Finally, for those returning from war, veteran’s affairs hospitals remain shamefully inaccessible. That VA hospitals may not have the resources to attend to all soldiers does not mean that thousands of soldiers should get lost in the system. The suicide count of veterans is astoundingly high, especially considering the number of non-governmental mental-health practitioners that could potentially have helped them. If VA hospitals don’t have the necessary staff to see troops, the army should provide vouchers and referrals to mental-health professionals who can. 
Mental health is at root a medical issue, but it is also a matter of honor. The current epidemic of suicides will be a stain in the history of the United States, but the U.S. has always moved to correct its injustices of the past. As such, any effort of the U.S. military to extend mental-health services for its troops should be one that all Americans embrace.

Standing in Obama’s Cabinet is a collection of Ivy Leaguers. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner—a Dartmouth grad—heads an economic-policy team that boasts four Harvard professors, whose students praise Obama’s picks. But the president should be leery of advisers who come from the same universities and work for the same administrations. Such similarity causes groupthink, and Obama may have assembled a set of bobbleheads.
The trouble with policy wonks is that they solve yesterday’s problems. Though policymakers should learn from their experience, they warp their judgment by learning too much from the particular crises they handled when they were last in office. As a result, they often ignore criticism in their attempt to prevent previous plights from recurring. And, when everyone in the room has the same nightmare, each in his lookout watches the same bogeyman.
For Obama’s aides, the nightmare is a depression like the one that struck Japan in the 1990s, and a slow government response is the bogeyman. Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Larry Summers were Clinton officials when a real-estate bubble in Japan burst, dragging the country into a decade-long slump. Alarmed by the downfall, they watched Tokyo gradually approve stimulus spending and scatter funding across projects—to no avail.
The takeaway for liberals was clear: In such a situation, government must spend rapidly and lavishly to avoid a similar fate. This month, Geithner pledged that the administration was “going to do our best” to eschew Japan’s example. Last October, Summers compared the downturn to our current recession in a Financial Times column. And, in his first White House press conference, Obama warned that if Washington dithered, the U.S. might suffer a “lost decade” like Japan. 
But, in their haste to dodge Tokyo’s mistakes, Obama and his advisers are making their own. Thinking government must spend something—anything—to boost the economy, Democrats scraped the pork barrel for ideas: $650 million for digital TV converter box coupons, $150 million for Smithsonian museum facilities, $100 million for reducing the hazard of lead-based paint. 
Ironically, Obama’s strategy of “act now, think later” repeats Japan’s mistakes. Tokyo spent $2.1 trillion between 1991 and 1995, yet the economy stagnated. Politicians built roads to nowhere, starving businesses of capital and workers of jobs. Washington should fund some infrastructure repairs, but such projects should undergo cost-benefit analyses. Lacking such oversight, the bill recently rushed through Congress will breed fraud and waste.
Consider a thought experiment proposed by Greg Mankiw. The government could send each person in the country a check with which he could pay his neighbor to dig holes in his backyard. Unemployment would fall, but so would welfare. Consumers could buy more useful goods if government allowed them to keep their money. Unfortunately, Japan casts such a long shadow that Obama and his advisers think the economy will tank by the time consumers spend or businesses reinvest.
Obama isn’t the first to decorate his Cabinet with narrow-minded academics. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed several professors to his administration, including the University of Chicago’s Paul Douglas and Columbia’s Rexford Tugwell. Like Obama’s aides, these scholars shared a common nightmare: a depression like the one that devastated Midwestern farmers in the 1920s. 
Following World War I, new technology made farms more efficient, creating large crop surpluses, low grain prices, and slim agricultural profits. Farmers suffered the fallout, convincing Roosevelt’s future advisers that capitalism had failed and only government could prevent further hardship. A decade later, these professors-turned-bureaucrats saw the bogeyman of the 1920s as the cause behind the Great Depression: an unregulated market. 
Once in power, Roosevelt and his aides tried to end the depression by replaying the 1920s. Assistant Agriculture Secretary Tugwell promised farmers pre-WWI prices, paying their competitors to grow fewer crops, thereby lowering surpluses. But these policies raised food prices at the very moment they needed to drop. For instance, the government orchestrated the death of six million piglets to support pork prices—at a time when the urban poor could not afford bacon.
These Ivy Leaguers fiddled with the economy for years, but it didn’t budge; double-digit unemployment continued until World War II. Applying the lessons of the 1920s to the 1930s, the policy wonks failed to consider other solutions. Today, Obama’s policymakers are applying the lessons of the 1990s to the 2000s. And they expect success?
Presidents shouldn’t appoint just anyone to their administrations, and Harvard offers some great talents. But no matter how smart they are, professors are still human. Groups of likeminded people fall victim to groupthink—sometimes with disastrous results. Indeed, when David Halberstam wrote his account of the Johnson administration’s bungling of Vietnam, he entitled it, “The Best and the Brightest.”

Nicholas A. Christakis—a sociology professor at Harvard Medical School and in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and his wife Erika L. Christakis ’86 will become Pforzheimer House’s new masters this fall, said Pfoho Resident Dean Lisa Boes, Monday night.Current Pfoho Masters Sue and James J. McCarthy announced their intention to step down this November.Christakis is best known for his work on health and social networks. His current research explores how factors such as health, disability, and death can influence an individual's social network. Last Wednesday, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced in an e-mail to the Winthrop House community that Law School Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Law School lecturer Stephanie Robinson will assume the posts as Harvard’s first black House masters next fall. Two months before Sullivan and Robinson’s selection, Hammonds said in an interview with The Crimson that she hoped to usher minority faculty into recently opened House Master positions. Like Robinson and Sullivan, who have an eight-year-old son, Ronald III, the Christakis family is relatively young, comprised of three children, Sebastian, Lysander, and Eleni, whose ages range from 11 to 16. Christakis is both a medical doctor and a Ph.D., holding four degrees from various Ivy League institutions, including a B.S. from Yale and a master’s from the Harvard School of Public Health. Christakis was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 2006, and though he continues research at HMS, the professor continues to teach a popular course at the College, Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the USA: Medicine and Disease in Social Context”. Christakis’ wife is an anthropologist and elementary school teacher who has spent her professional career advocating for children and families. A graduate of the College, she holds a Master’s Degree in early childhood education from Lesley University and one in public health from Johns Hopkins. —Staff writer Bita M.

ITHACA, N.Y.—Coming off a 1-4 home stand at Lavietes Pavilion, the Harvard men’s basketball team received a taste of a true home court advantage Friday night, falling to Cornell in a 96-75 blowout at Newman Arena. Led by all-Ivy forward Ryan Wittman’s 20 points, the Big Red (16-7, 6-1 Ivy) extended its home win streak to a school-record 18 straight games. Although it put up its highest point total since defeating Boston College over a month ago, the Crimson (10-11, 2-5) also gave up the most points it has all season, allowing Cornell to shoot an astounding 62% from the field.“Offensively they’re very efficient, and they have a lot of weapons,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Overall we weren’t very good defensively. Perimeter, post, they broke us down.”Facing the top offensive team in the Ancient Eight, the Crimson had no answers for a balanced attack that seemed able to score at will. Accumulating an impressive 31 assists, the Big Red made over half of its three-point attempts while dominating the paint, tallying 42 points inside to Harvard’s 30. Seven-foot senior Jeff Foote made a strong impact on both ends of the floor, pulling in a game-high seven rebounds.“I haven’t seen any better big man in our conference yet,” Amaker said. “[Foote’s] a very good offensive player, and an incredible defensive presence for their team.”Forward Adam Wire and guard Chris Wroblewski played key roles for the home team, combining for 31 points off the bench, as Wroblewski went an impressive five-of-six from beyond the arc.Despite junior Jeremy Lin scoring a mere 11 points, the Crimson offense had a few bright spots. Senior Drew Housman’s veteran presence led the way with team-highs of 16 points and 6 assists, and freshman Max Kenyi used his athleticism to slash to the basket and draw fouls, going eight-of-nine from the charity stripe for a total of 14 points.“That’s what we need from Max,” Amaker said. “We need him to make a splash and make his presence felt.”Harvard made 21 free throws, double the number of its opponent’s attempts from the line, but the Crimson made only four three-pointers, going zero-for-six from behind the arc in the second half. The Cornell transition game was on full display, as Harvard’s 16 turnovers led to 24 Big Red points, many of them coming on the fast break. It was Amaker’s squad, however, that came out hot opening the second half. Down 51-35 going into the intermission, Harvard went on a 10-0 run in the first three and a half minutes of the frame. Housman had a hand in the first four baskets of the spurt, draining jumpers as well as setting up senior Evan Harris for a layup. A gorgeous fall-back jumper by Lin punctuated the run, which cut the lead to six, but any hopes for a dramatic finish were soon dashed when the Crimson missed seven of its next nine field goal attempts.“You spend a lot of energy just trying to get back in it, and any time they can raise up and get a three, or get an easy bucket, it just takes the wind out of you,” Amaker said.After a soaring Kenyi layup cut the deficit to 12 halfway through the period, Wittman responded with a jumper and a transition three pointer, igniting a 16-6 run over a span of about four minutes. “It’s just demoralizing when they hit those threes, especially when the crowd gets into it,” Housman said.The Big Red took a 24-point lead with 5:40 to play and never looked back, continuing to exhibit excellent ball movement and repeatedly finding wide-open looks.Such was the trend of the first half as well. Harvard was grossly overmatched on the interior, giving up 22 field goals and 24 easy baskets in the paint during the opening 20 minutes. Cornell’s swarming defense proved vulnerable to guard penetration but forced 12 turnovers in the frame, including seven from Lin.“Their guards were pressuring up a lot, so if we kept our poise and made hard drives, we were able to get to the basket,” Housman said.The Crimson took a 9-7 lead when captain Andrew Pusar found Housman in the corner for a three-pointer four minutes into the game, but the ensuing 19-1 Big Red run put the home team ahead for good.A strong contender for the play of the game came halfway through the first half, when Foote flipped up a short jumper from the right block. Overcoming a height differential of eight inches, Kenyi leapt up and denied the Cornell big man, swatting his attempt into the hardwood.—Staff writer Dennis J.

NEW YORK—A Valentine’s Day date with Columbia in the city seemed like a promising opportunity for the men’s basketball team to experience some winning action. The night progressed well—Harvard (10-12, 2-6 Ivy) flashed some moves on defense, got physical going to the basket, and applied pressure in the right places.But at the end of the night, Harvard was outright denied. The Crimson left the Levien Gymnasium engagement empty-handed after losing the lead in the final five seconds.Down 59-58, Columbia (10-12, 5-3) took the ball at half court with 27 seconds left on the clock. Columbia guard Kevin Bulger accepted a pass, drove towards the paint and put up a jumper. 1,014 fans in Levien watched as the ball kissed the rim and bounced back towards the court, gracing the fingers of several Crimson players before finding its way back into Bulger’s waiting hands. The guard sent the ball back towards the rim, and this time it would fall.“[Bulger] hit a tough, spinning, one-handed shot,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “[Captain Andrew Pusar] was right there and he played good defense I thought.”“We had our chances—one defensive rebound and we couldn’t come up with it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.With 4.3 seconds remaining on the clock, junior guard Jeremy Lin received the ball behind the line, as his teammates manned their positions down court. When the whistle blew, Pusar broke free from his defender and took the inbound pass. The captain looked to pass it back to Lin, the team’s leading scorer, only to find him swarmed by two Lion defenders with time ticking down. Abandoning the original plan, Pusar took a few hurried steps up to half court where he launched the ball at the rim. Seeing the shot fall short, the Columbia bench leapt to its feet in a victorious fervor.Throughout the first 10 minutes of the second, Harvard had looked primed for victory. The Crimson chugged along, leading by as much as 10 over an underperforming Lions team. Harvard forced fouls left and right and utilized a number of free throws to drive its assault.But as the clock ticked down, a mind-numbing series of turnovers and failed possessions turned the tide and gave the Lions a chance to chomp away at Harvard’s lead. While Columbia amped up its offensive assault, the Crimson lost steam, stumbling through a 5:52 offensive drought and managing only four attempts in the final five minutes.“We didn’t execute down the stretch,” Housman said. “We were a little too hesitant against their zone.”The Crimson also had trouble finishing a strong performance in the first half.  Towards the culmination of the first period, the tide seemed to be going the Crimson’s way. With 2:05 left, Harvard held a 33-28 advantage, following a steal by Pusar, that led to two quality free throws from Lin. Enter Lion guard K.J. Matsui. Matsui, who typically averages just over six points per game, drained two back-to-back contested threes to grant the Lions a one point advantage. Other than the climactic final minute, Harvard mustered up a sufficient post game throughout the second half following its virtual nonexistence in the first. The Crimson grabbed only 11 boards in the first frame. Neither of the team’s forwards put up any points until the second period, when freshman Keith Wright and senior Evan Harris combined for five points and five rebounds.“That’s not a lot of production there for our big two guys inside,” Amaker said. The majority of Harvard’s rebounds came from Lin, Pusar, and Housman, who each contributed five. Harvard outrebounded Columbia 15-14 in the second, but the faulty start gave the Lions the overall advantage, 34-26.Following a rough game against Cornell the night before, junior guard Jeremy Lin stepped up his game. Lin dropped 19 on the Lions, including four points off fast breaks. His presence was felt on the defensive end, too; Lin kept up pressure in the back and caused more trouble than three steals and a block could describe. But—like the night before—lost possessions disrupted the guard’s game.   “[Lin] struggled at times tonight,” Amaker said. “Six turnovers, that’s the thing I’m concerned with more than anything else.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—After a recent string of poor first-halves, a good start was a point of emphasis for the Harvard men’s basketball team heading into Saturday’s game against Columbia. 
In its loss against Yale, the Crimson headed into halftime trailing 45-40. The next day, although Harvard beat Brown in dramatic fashion, it was losing 32-20 at the break. Friday, en route to a 96-75 loss to Cornell, the Crimson never recovered from a 51-35 halftime deficit.  
Saturday, however, Harvard managed to rectify its struggles. A 10-0 surge in the middle of the half lifted the Crimson to a lead that it maintained for most of the half. 
The run began with a three-pointer from the wing by freshman forward Peter Boehm. Then, captain Andrew Pusar got to the line, where he hit both free-throws. Junior guard Jeremy Lin intercepted a pass on the defensive end and took the ball all the way to the rim to stretch the lead before senior guard Drew Housman capped the run with a three-pointer from the corner. 
Harvard appeared to be heading into the intermission with this lead, its first since the victory over Boston College, until Lions guard K.J. Matsui drained back-to-back three-pointers to gain a 34-33 edge.   
“We were pleased with the first half up until the last two and a half, three minutes,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. 
Matsui shouldered much of the scoring load for Columbia in the first half. The senior began the game hitting two long-distance three-pointers to send the Lions to a 6-0 lead, and he struck again later in the first half to tie the game at 20.  
“We were hoping that we would not allow him to get open for three-point shots, but he certainly did,” Amaker said. “His shooting was the key for their ability to have the halftime lead.” 
In spite of Matsui’s shooting, the Crimson’s solid play kept the score even. With a 14-3 run in the first 5 minutes of the second half, Harvard built a considerable lead, one that would not ultimately last.  
FREE-THROW SHOOTING 
The Crimson’s second-half run was keyed by its ability to convert from the charity stripe. Just over seven minutes into the half, Columbia picked up its seventh team foul and put Harvard into the bonus. 
The Crimson took advantage, hitting 13-of-15 in the second half and 19-of-25 for the game. 
“Coach has always made it a point to get to the line,” senior forward Evan Harris said.  “We knew we could score points with the clock stopped so we tried to get to the line as much as possible.” 
This approach was particularly effective when the offense stalled after the Lions switched to a zone defense late in the second half. 
Over the last ten minutes of the game, Harvard managed only five field-goal attempts, yet it scored eight points thanks to its free-throw shooting. 
“It’s tougher for us to score sometimes. The foul-line is one of those areas where we try to manufacture some points,” Amaker said. “We shot a pretty good percentage from there tonight.” 
ROUGH ROAD 
As if losing in the final seconds was not disappointing enough, it left the Crimson heading home winless on its New York road trip.  
“Man, that was just a really tough loss,” Housman said.  
Saturday’s loss, which dropped Harvard to a 2-6 record in Ivy League play, came on the heels of a 96-75 drubbing from Cornell. 
“We’ve just had enough of this losing, especially after [Friday night] up at Cornell,” Harris said. “I don’t think they were 20 points better than we were.” 
As it heads into the second half of league play, the Crimson looks to grow from this tough weekend. 
“It was definitely encouraging,” Harris said. “For the first time in a while, we got six, seven stops in a row, which was big. If we can remember that communication and talk we had in that stretch, then take it next week to Princeton and Penn, hopefully we can finally get some wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Four minutes into the second half of Friday’s game against Cornell, one word must have occupied each member of Harvard’s men’s basketball team: repeat.A sluggish first half left the Crimson with a 51-35 deficit heading into the locker room in Newman Arena. But the men’s squad emerged reinvigorated and kicked off the second period with a 10-0 run that brought them to within six of the defending Ivy League champ. Cornell looked uncoordinated, frustrated, and nothing like the team that went 22-of-36 in the first half, while Harvard looked to assemble another come-from-behind victory.Flash back to Feb. 7, 2009, when the Crimson, down by 12 to Brown—the team with the worst record in the Ivy League after the first period—metamorphosed during halftime. Following an unimpressive first half, Harvard returned to the court and began making shots, forcing turnovers and building up momentum against a team that was forced to fall back on its star player down the line. The Crimson ultimately came away victorious thanks to these improved efforts, an epic stuff by senior Evan Harris, and a final-second free-throw from junior Jeremy Lin.The sluggish start, the energized return, the discombobulated opponent—the comeback trend seemed to be repeating itself several minutes into the second half of the Cornell game.“In the locker room, we were saying that we know we’re better than this—let’s put a run together,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “And for that four- or five-minute stretch, we had great intensity, especially on the defensive end. It’s just that we weren’t able to sustain that burst. As Harvard’s explosion of energy hit its crescendo, Cornell, too, fell back on its star player. But that’s where the trend ceased to continue.The reigning Ivy League player of the year, junior guard Louis Dale, finally ended Harvard’s run with a quick layup. Dale then grabbed a defensive board and earned Cornell a possession that culminated in an intimidating dunk by Big Red center Jeff Foote. Harvard slipped away from there, eventually sinking more than 20 points behind Cornell as the Big Red’s three-point shooting game caught fire.“It was kind of like all or nothing, and then they hit a couple shots and we broke down,” Housman said. “We got to be able to sustain that energy the whole game and we’ll be a good team.”FROM DOWNTOWNPrepping for the game, the big threat seemed to be Cornell’s big man. Standing at 7’0, Foote looked poised to walk over Harvard’s paint amidst a bevy of Crimson injuries.But the Big Red’s dominant post game was far from the only reason the Crimson trailed by as much as 24 after coming within six in the second half. Cornell’s three-point shooting proved to be a lethal threat. Harvard anticipated the deadly range of its opponents, but could not lock down the shooters due to other concerns. Doubling up on Foote, Crimson defenders frequently found themselves reeling to cover wide open Big Red shooters Ryan Wittman and Chris Wroblewski. The desperate defensive attempts were often too little, too late.“I thought they were really good around the goal,” Amaker said. “They stretched out with really good shooters...it’s demoralizing for our defense that they can make some of those very tough, tough shots.”While Foote contributed a quiet 10 points, the Big Red went 11-of-21 from beyond the arc. Wittman and Wroblewski combined for 27 points from three-point range alone.But not all the blame rests on Harvard’s thinly-spread defensive efforts—Cornell’s shooting was on. The Big Red boasted a 61.9% field-goal percentage throughout the game.OFF THE BENCHHarvard’s all freshmen bench was thrown into the fire against the Big Red. Oliver McNally, Peter Boehm, and Max Kenyi battled on the court for 27, 23 and 25 minutes, respectively—each more than some of the Crimson’s starters. Among the three, Kenyi experienced the most offensive success by going 8-of-9 in free throws and scoring 14 total points.Compared to Harvard’s reserves, Cornell’s bench proved to be more supplemental than instrumental to the Big Red’s game plan. Freed up by Foote, Wroblewski led the Big Red’s nonstarters with his shooting and contributed 17-of-44 points from the bench.“They’re deep,” Amaker said. “They’ve been very successful and I think they have a lot of experience. You see that and the size of the kids and their bodies and how efficient they were—they had a lot of weapons. They keep going down the roster.”—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing loss last Tuesday in the Beanpot final, the Crimson is back in business.  The Harvard women’s hockey team cruised past Cornell on Friday at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y., earning a 5-2 victory and clinching its second consecutive Ivy League title and eighth overall.  Tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt showed no mercy on the Big Red, and played a part in all five of the team’s goals—with four goals and an assist.  After a sluggish start to the game, the Crimson rallied back with four goals in the final period, ending with a three-goal advantage over its Ivy rival. “The team played pretty well overall, but started a little bit slow,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We turned on after their goal and had a solid third period.”The first period was packed with numerous penalties, keeping the Crimson on its toes.  “We probably gave them too many opportunities,” tri-captain Jenny Brine said.  “They have a very talented first line, but Kessler played a great game in net. Overall, defense was still looking good.”  Cornell was only able to manage 11 shots in the first period, despite three power-play opportunities.The second period put the Crimson ahead, 1-0, after nine minutes. Cornell freshman goaltender Amanda Mazzotta got a good look as Vaillancourt flew down the ice off a pass from sophomore Katharine Chute.  But  after Mazzotta made the initial save, Vaillancourt sunk the rebound, getting the Crimson on the board.Harvard still had command over the game at the start of the third period, but not for long.  Within the first minute, the Big Red’s Rebecca Johnston crossed the puck into the right corner of the net, tying the score, 1-1.  But the Cornell goal did not put the Crimson down.“Right after Cornell’s goal, we responded well and took it to them,” Stone said. Harvard answered with four more goals in the final frame, three belonging to Vaillancourt and the other to Brine.The first Crimson goal of the third came from Vaillancourt less then seven minutes into the period. Vaillancourt received a pass from junior Kathryn Farni behind the blue line, and outskated two Cornell defenders on a breakaway to set up the score.Within minutes, Vaillancourt tallied her third goal off another pass from linemate Chute. This score rounded off Vaillancourt’s hat trick, her third of the season, and was the 100th goal of her collegiate career. Even with a solid lead, Harvard did not let up. Brine added to the score at 11:15, with a short-handed goal on a pass from Vaillancourt. It was Brine’s first goal of the game, and the fourth for the Crimson.“It was a great game overall,” Brine said. “The team really came out flying. We all had confidence going into the third that we were going to pull ahead…Sarah had a great game and really contributed on the scoreboard.”At 14:29, Vaillancourt was back at the Big Red net. Tallying her fourth goal of the game and third of the period, Vaillancourt stretched the gap to 5-1. Junior Cori Bassett recorded an assist on the play.With only 1:27 left on the clock, Cornell’s Johnston scored her second goal of the contest, bringing the final score to 5-2.Though Vaillancourt stole the show, junior goalie Christina Kessler, Chute, and Brine turned in impressive performances as well. Kessler made a career-high 35 saves for the Crimson, while Brine put in a goal, and Chute added two assists.  Harvard was outshot, 37-34, overall, but held Cornell scoreless on its six power plays.The Crimson went 0-for-3 with a man advantage, while Mazzotta finished with 29 saves.Overall, Stone was impressed with the team’s composure and its desire to win. “The lines clicked, people were finding each other, and everyone was sharing the puck,” she said. “The selflessness led to our success.”

As the Harvard women’s basketball team shakes off the loss that ended its five-game win streak and prepares for the second half of Ivy League play, it will have to remember one thing: hold onto the ball.The Crimson has averaged over 18 turnovers a game this season and has committed more than 20 turnovers in five of its eight losses (and, surprisingly, in three of its 13 wins). The final numbers from this weekend’s pair of games paint a picture of a generally poor ball-handling effort for the Crimson—the team turned the ball over 19 times in Friday night’s win and 20 in Saturday night’s loss. But it was the 16 first-half turnovers in Saturday’s game that spelled disaster for Harvard. The Lions’ stifling full-court pressure forced sloppy play from Crimson guards and post players alike. Harvard’s porous fast-break defense didn’t help its cause, as Columbia was able to convert easy buckets and set up its press. During one three-minute stretch early on, the Crimson turned the ball over five times.When the first-half buzzer sounded and Harvard headed to the locker room down just six, it seemed to have weathered a storm of its own making.“Usually when we have a game like this, we’re down and there’s no emotion,” co-captain Emily Tay said. “But in the locker room, it was very positive, we were ready to go at it again in the second half.”After the break, Harvard settled down and established its 2-1-2 press-break scheme with effectiveness—it turned the ball over just four times after halftime.“We changed nothing [at halftime], absolutely nothing,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We just reminded them of what they’re supposed to be doing. We just played frenetic in the first half.”But turnovers didn’t directly cost the Crimson its sixth-straight win Saturday. After a stellar first half of shooting, poor shooting in the second left Harvard trading leads with Columbia throughout the second half and unable to convert on a chance to win in its final possession. The home team converted 60 percent of its attempts from the floor, including a 7-for-11 performance from sophomore forward Emma Markley. REF’ED UP Turnovers may have sealed the Crimson’s fate Saturday night, but spotty officiating—especially down the stretch—didn’t help either.Two debatable calls with under 30 seconds to play in the game swung in the Lions’ favor, and Delaney-Smith and the Crimson were left scratching their heads.Down by one, Harvard put together a disciplined defensive possession that included an inbounds play from Columbia after an offensive rebound and timeout. But freshman Brogan Berry was called for a foul on the Lions’ Lauren Dywer as the shot clock buzzer sounded.After Dwyer made one of two, Berry’s drive to the hoop—which included plenty of contact—came and went without a whistle. Berry’s miss sealed the three-point victory for Columbia.“You’re going to call that? Then call that,” Delaney-Smith said, pointing first to the spot on the floor where Berry was called for the personal, then to the spot of the Crimson’s failed final possession. “I say don’t call either, but just do the same thing at both ends.Questionable calls throughout the game upset Delaney-Smith, Columbia coach Paul Nixon, and fans on both sides.“The officials were bad,” Tay said, “but they were probably bad both ways.” THREE PARTY The league’s top-two three-point shooting teams took turns launching shots from longe range Friday evening at Lavietes. Cornell and Harvard finished the weekend first and second in the rankings with .336 and .332 three-point percentages, respectively.But while the Big Red stuck with its bread and butter to mixed success, the Crimson took just eight threes and chose to focus on its defense.Already leading by eight points at the break, the Crimson played lock-down defense on the perimeter to retain control. The Big Red shot just 4-of-15 from distance after halftime—before she hit her first three with 6:11 to play in the game, Cornell guard Allie Fedorowicz had been 0-7 from beyond the arc. Harvard converted just one of two three-pointers in the second half, but it was a big one—after the Big Red seemed ready for a final push, Berry drilled a three to push the lead back up to 11 with under five minutes to play. Cornell never got within single digits again.The departure of former Big Red forward and 2008 Ivy Player of the Year Jeomi Maduka and injury to Crimson forward Katie Rollins meant a different style of play from the physical nature of last year’s games between the co-defending champions.Cornell stayed home on Harvard shooters Berry, sophomore Christine Matera, and co-captain Niki Finelli, and Markley took advantage of the wide-open lane to the tune of 18 points and 10 rebounds. Sophomore Claire Wheeler added nine boards of her own, including four on the offensive glass. —Staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

When the Harvard women’s hockey team rolled into Hamilton, N.Y. on Saturday, its afternoon contest with Colgate had all the makings of a trap game.The fatigued Crimson was playing its sixth game in two weeks and the Raiders—while stuck in the middle of the pack in the ECAC standings—held an impressive 12-4-1 record at home.But Harvard (15-8-3, 14-4-2 ECAC) is dominating its conference opponents right now, and the team used that momentum to barely sneak out of Hamilton victorious, beating Colgate (17-11-3, 11-6-3), 2-1.“It was a good hockey game,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Our kids played with a lot of heart and grit...We didn’t have as much energy as we normally do but we fought through it.”With the game tied at one and only three minutes left in the third period, senior forward Sarah Wilson swooped in to save the day for Harvard. After Raiders goalie Kimberly Sass turned away a shot by sophomore center Anna McDonald, Wilson hammered the rebound under Sass and into the net to give the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish.“It was a huge goal for us,” Harvard tri-captain Jenny Brine said. “It gave us confidence in the last three minutes. We basically killed their momentum.”The goal was timely in more ways than one. The Crimson’s second forward line of Wilson, McDonald, and sophomore Kate Buesser had been struggling to score of late, and the tally provided the trio with a needed confidence boost.“That line’s been playing so well,” Stone said. “They’ve had good chances, but they haven’t gotten the results that they wanted. They were fired up.”Following Wilson’s tally—her 11th of the season—Harvard clamped down on defense, and junior goalie Christina Kessler extended her recent stretch of stellar play, shutting down the Raiders for the remainder of the game. Kessler made 25 saves on the afternoon in another outstanding performance. The netminder has allowed just five goals in her last six games, coming closer to her form of last year, in which she set the NCAA single-season shutouts record.“She’s playing the way a goalie of her caliber should play,” Stone said. “She’s doing her part. She’s taking responsibility.”Kessler made her most important contribution of the game after junior Kathryn Farni took down Colgate’s Hannah Milan on a breakaway at 11:27 in the third and with the score tied. Milan was awarded a penalty shot, but Kessler was ready for her, denying the attempt and preventing the Raiders from taking the lead.“[Kessler is] doing a great job of being focused,” Brine said. “She’s played unbelievable in these last few games.”Brine got the Crimson on the board in the first period with a goal 17:18 into the game. Sophomore Katharine Chute fired a shot that Sass deflected to the right side of the net. Brine sent the rebound top shelf over Sass’ shoulder, giving Harvard an early 1-0 lead.Conspicuously absent from the scoring sheet was tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, but not for lack of effort. Vaillancourt took 10 shots, but after a stretch in which she had a hand in 18 of the Crimson’s 19 goals, it was time for Harvard’s other stars to shine.Brine, Wilson, and Kessler came up big, ensuring that the Crimson controls its own destiny as it stares down the end of the regular season. Harvard is just one point behind No. 7 St. Lawrence in the ECAC standings—with a game against the Saints coming up this weekend—and has re-entered the national rankings at No. 9. “We’re in a good spot,” Stone said. “We’re right where we want to be. Its all up to us.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

The No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team fell to No. 1 Princeton 5-4 in a thrilling Howe Cup Championship Final Sunday afternoon in an epic bout that will go down as one of the most thrilling in the tournament’s history. The team reached the final by dispatching No. 7 Stanford and No. 3 Penn in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, respectively.The defeat marks the third time in the last five years that the Crimson has fallen in the Howe Cup final, although this one was certainly the closest.“The whole team was incredibly ready for this match,” junior captain Johanna Snyder said. “We went out there, totally in the zone. Luck just didn’t go our way.” The second-place finish is a marked improvement over last year’s performance, in which the team fell to Trinity in the opening round and took fifth place in the tournament.Harvard next gears up for the CSA Individual Tournament in Williams, Mass., to be held Feb. 27-March 1. PRINCETON 5, HARVARD 4The Crimson came up just short in the national-title match, falling 5-4 to the Tigers. The loss gave Princeton its third-consecutive national title.But Harvard certainly had its chances.Masterful performances by No. 5 junior Katherine O’Donnell and No. 6 sophomore Bethan Williams were offset with losses by No. 3 freshman Emily Park, No. 9 sophomore Ali Zindman, and No. 2 sophomore June Tiong.Williams displayed some spectacular shot-making in her victory, adeptly adjusting to balls off the back glass, reflexive chop volleys, and potent defensive lobs to defeat the Tigers’ Maggie O’Toole (7-9, 9-4, 9-3, 9-5), who a week earlier had bested Williams, 3-1.With the score 3-2 in the Tigers’ favor, No. 8 freshman Cece Cortes led Nikki Sequiera, 2-0, in games and was within two points of winning her match, and ultimately the championship. However, Sequiera launched a comeback for the ages, winning 27 out of the next 30 points to take the match (3-9, 2-9, 9-7, 9-0, 9-3).With her team down 4-2, freshman No. 1 Nirasha Guruge built a 2-1 advantage over Princeton’s Amanda Siebert and led 4-1 in the fourth set. However, Siebert clawed her way back to take that game 9-5, and rolled over Guruge 9-1 in the fifth as the Tigers celebrated the championship.“We were in a winning position,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “It was just not meant to be. Sometimes sport works in mysterious ways. Everybody played their best squash, but it just didn’t seem to go our way.”With the outcome already decided, Sophomore No. 4 Alisha Mashruwala and No. 7 Snyder turned in gutsy performances, winning 3-1 and 3-0, to narrow the final margin.Despite the loss, Harvard can rest assured knowing that it will be back with a vengeance next season. With no seniors on the squad and seven out of the starting nine in their first or second years, the team will certainly be a top contender for the 2010 Howe Cup—and the 2011 Howe Cup, for that matter.“I’m really excited about next year,” O’Donnell said. “I think we needed the experience of a national-title match. It changes the way you look at the rest of your career. It matures and focuses you.” HARVARD 7, PENN 2The Crimson efficiently dispatched No. 3 Penn, 7-2, Saturday afternoon in the semifinals of the Howe Cup.Despite having defeated the Quakers soundly just ten days earlier, the team remained focused on the match at hand and didn’t allow visions of a rematch with Princeton to affect its play.“We put all of our effort into this match and didn’t worry about tomorrow, because if we don’t win against Penn, we don’t get to see tomorrow,” Snyder said.Cortes and Zindman each dominated their matches, 3-0, to give Harvard an early edge. A pair of 3-1 wins by Williams and Park built on that lead.With the score 4-0, Harvard was poised to clinch a berth in the finals against Princeton. Playing on adjacent courts and each up 2-1, O’Donnell and Snyder entertained the crowd with a game of “who-can-clinch-first” for the Crimson. It was a battle won narrowly by O’Donnell, with an 8-10, 10-8, 9-7, 9-3 victory over Christina Matthias of Penn that would send the Crimson to the finals. Snyder closed out her match moments later with a 10-8, 9-3, 4-9, 10-9 victory to ice the cake.Penn’s only victories of the day came in the top two flights, where the Quakers’ Kristen Lange and Sydney Scott swept No. 1 Guruge and No. 2 Tiong, respectively.  HARVARD 8, STANFORD 1Harvard cruised past No. 7 Stanford, 8-1, Friday afternoon in the opening round of the Howe Cup.The Crimson jumped out to an 8-0 lead with six out of the nine flights, sweeping their matches 3-0.Guruge downed the Cardinals’ Lilly Lorentzen, a former Harvard standout and 2006 individual national champion, in dominating fashion (9-1, 9-0, 9-6) to win her second consecutive match at the top flight.The only blemish of the day came at No. 7, where Cortes suffered her first loss of the season, a 9-5, 9-8, 9-6 setback to the Cardinal’s Kyla Sherwood.—Staff writer Barrett P.

In its final tune-up before Ivy League Championships, the No. 25 Harvard women’s swimming and diving team took nine of 11 events in an exhibition relay meet with Northeastern Friday at Blodgett Pool.Sophomore Katy Hinkle was part of three winning teams, anchoring the 150-yard butterfly relay and leading off in the 200-yard medley and 250-yard medley relay events.Hinkle posted the top split (25.92) for her 50-yard butterfly leg as she teamed up with sophomore Robyn Thom and junior Sophie Morgan to win the opening butterfly relay.As the meet shifted to graduated relays, Harvard continued to find success, winning the 500-yard freestyle relay (4:40.05). Freshman Monica Burgos, sophomore Holly Furman, Zagroba, and junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke earned the narrow victory over Lightbourne, sophomores Ali Slack and Christine Kaufmann, and junior Katie Faulkner.The Crimson also came out on top in the 300-yard medley relay and the 300-yard freestyle relay.Northeastern’s only win came in the 150-yard freestyle relay, where the Huskies edged out sophomore Katherine Pickard, Clarke, and sophomore Laura Murray by just three-tenths of a second.On the diving side, freshman Leslie Rea won both the 1-meter (267.82) and 3-meter (269.10) competitions. Sophomores Marissa Ash and Anne Taylor helped round out the Harvard sweeps of both events.The relay meet was the Crimson’s last home competition of the season, and the team’s two seniors—Sundberg and co-captain Kelly Mooney—were honored on the Senior Day.Harvard will try to unseat defending champion Princeton at the Ivy League Championships next week. —KATE LEIST

The Crimson women’s water polo team launched the 2009 season at home in the Harvard Invitational this past weekend. The Crimson (1-1) opened the invite with a win against the New York Athletic Club (NYAC) and followed with a loss to No. 8 Michigan on Saturday. On Sunday morning, the team squared off against NYAC again, this time failing to record a victory. The team concluded the weekend against Siena (0-2), gaining its first collegiate win of the season. Harvard looks to improve upon last season’s 12-12 overall record.HARVARD 11, SIENA 4After last year’s 12-8 victory against Siena, the Crimson defeated the Saints once again, 11-4, to conclude the invitational at Blodgett Pool. Harvard jumped out to an early 7-0 lead and never looked back.“It was a really fun game and we learned how to capitalize as a team,” freshman center Devan Kennifer said. Kennifer scored four goals in the game. Sophomore Patricia Smith, junior Roxanne Pinto, freshman Monica Zdrojewski, junior Kelly Peeler, and co-captain Devon MacLaughlin also contributed offensively.NYAC 12, HARVARD 10Earlier on Sunday, the Crimson lost a heartbreaker to NYAC. After building an 8-2 lead by halftime, Harvard gave up eight goals in the third quarter, while scoring only two itself. In the decisive fourth quarter, Crimson coach Erik Farrar’s team was shut out as Harvard lost 12-10.Despite the final outcome, the team looked impressive in the first half. The Crimson began a 6-0 run less than two minutes into the game. Zdrojewski scored two goals during this stretch.Farrar credited the first-half success to a “very effective defense” that was “active in transition.”NYAC opened the second half with five unanswered goals. Farrar claimed that the Harvard counterattack was not successful in the second half. “We did not execute well on the perimeter in the second half, and that was essentially the decisive thing,” Farrar said. “That allowed them too many opportunities.”MICHIGAN 13, HARVARD 2On Saturday, the Crimson faced No. 8 Michigan. Harvard missed some crucial opportunities and made some costly mistakes, which resulted in a 13-2 defeat. Kennifer and junior Kristina Bergquist recorded the two goals. Goalie and co-captain Nicola Perlman made six stops against the Wolverine attack.Despite the score, Farrar said he was relatively pleased with his team’s performance.“We didn’t shoot very effectively, [but] as we go forward, we will do a better job of capitalizing on those scoring chances,” Farrar said.MacLaughlin looked at the game as a chance early in the season to play a top team and see what the team does well and what it needs to do better. “We see it as a good experience to learn from a really great competitor,” she said. HARVARD 10, NYAC 6Earlier on Saturday, the Crimson played NYAC to open its season. Perlman, a former chair of Fifteen Minutes, led her team to a 10-6 victory, making 14 saves. Kennifer also played a leading role in the offense, scoring five goals in her collegiate debut. MacLaughlin scored two goals in the game. Smith, freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough, and freshman Shannon Purcell all found the net as well.Farrar described NYAC as an “experienced masters team,” and was pleased with his team’s performance on Saturday. The game marked the debut of freshmen team members. The new players showed great improvement by “learning how to play together against opponents [and] execute at this level,” Farrar said.Harvard plays its next games at the Princeton Invitational on Feb. 21 and 22. The squad will square off against Villanova, Princeton, George Washington, and Bucknell.

The Harvard skiing team is lacking some key scorers on both the Nordic and alpine squads this year, but one thing the Cambridge contingent cannot be faulted for is a lack of consistency. Another weekend of racing for both the men’s and women’s squads this past Friday and Saturday at the 99th Annual Dartmouth College Carnival resulted in another tenth-place finish, the Crimson’s fourth such effort in as many meets this season on the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association (EISA) carnival circuit. While Harvard may be falling victim to a small roster and some untimely injuries, there were, nonetheless, some bright spots for the Crimson. Both of Dartmouth’s courses, the Skiway and Oak Hill, benefited from warm weather earlier in the week, followed by freezing temperatures the night before the contests, making the snow hard and icy leading into the competitions.  The men’s alpine squad led the way, with a great individual performance by junior alpine captain Chris Kinner in the Giant Slalom event and a ninth-place team effort in the Giant Slalom race.  Kinner placed 17th in the Friday contest, which was his best showing as a collegiate skier. He had started the day in 43rd place, moved up to a tie for 28th place after the first run, and then had the 12th-fastest showing in his second run, leading to his 17th-place final position. “The race hill at Dartmouth is challenging because it is so easy,” Kinner said. “On flat courses like Dartmouth, every little mistake slows you down a lot. This means that going just a little faster or slower will result in a very different position.” Freshman Kevin McNamara was the Crimson’s top finisher in the Slalom event, finishing 29th in the race, a 34-place improvement over his starting position. “He skied consistently, without any major mistakes,” Kinner said. “While I know he’s not satisfied with that result, it’s impressive nonetheless for a freshman of his age to be in the top-30 at such a highly competitive race with so many top-level skiers.” In the women’s Giant Slalom event, freshman Caroline McHugh finished tied for 33rd, an 18-place improvement over her starting position. She followed that performance with a 40th-place effort in the Slalom race, a 19-place improvement over her 59th starting position. The men’s Nordic squad did not fare as well this weekend in Hanover with Oak Hill’s difficult downhills and well-known S-curve, as the men finished tenth in the 15K Freestyle event and twelfth in the 10K Classic event. Nordic captain Dave McCahill and junior Trevor Petach led the Crimson effort with 50th- and 51st- place showings, respectively, in the 15K race, and 57th- and 56th- place efforts, respectively, in the shorter 10K event. “The men’s team is taking a little longer to get going,” McCahill said. “We are recovering from some sprained ankle issues on the team, but I think the season is shaping up pretty well.” The women’s Nordic squad slightly outdid its male counterpart, placing 10th in both of its efforts over the weekend.  Sophomore Cara Sprague finished 25th in the 5K Classic event on Friday, a noteworthy 46-place improvement over her starting position. In the 10K Freestyle event, Sprague placed 35th and sophomore Alyssa Devlin finished 43rd to lead the Harvard effort. “The women’s team has performed well this season,” McCahill said. “Sprague was our top skier this weekend, and the team showed some of its great depth.” Despite some of the troubles endured this weekend, McCahill felt both Nordic squads should be able to rebound nicely next weekend at the Middlebury College Carnival in Middlebury, Vermont. “We are excited for next weekend,” McCahill said. “We know the Middlebury loops well and should be able to come out and perform in the relay style format.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

It was the perfect David versus Goliath matchup. But this time, Goliath had no problem taking care of David.The Harvard men’s volleyball team entered Big Ten country last Friday with plans of upsetting defending national champion Penn State, only to leave town as the Nittany Lions’ latest victim, 3-0. The very next day, Harvard (2-4, 0-2) fell to league foe East Stroudsburg, 3-0, despite beating the Warriors just a week ago at home.  EAST STROUDSBURG 3, HARVARD 0The Crimson entered Saturday’s game against East Stroudsburg looking to rebound from its loss against Penn State, but fell to the Warriors 3-0 (30-24, 30-25, 30-27) in East Stroudsburg, Penn.Harvard stayed competitive throughout the entire game, but Warrior senior Jon Daley was too much to handle, tallying 14 kills, seven digs, and one block. Senior captain Brady Weissbourd was the lone standout for the Crimson, accounting for a match-high 16 kills, four blocks, and scoring 20.5 of Harvard’s 47 points.“We were pretty determined to win the match and end the road trip on a positive note,” coach Brian Baise said. “Unfortunately, we ended up more mentally tired and exhausted than we thought.”Hurting the Crimson offensively was the absence of freshman phenom Nikola Ivica, who sat out with an elbow injury.Several of the players also attributed the long journey as a reason for the loss against East Stroudsburg.“In general, it had been a really long weekend,” junior Soren Rosier said. “We spent many, many long hours on a bus and hotel...By the time we got to East Stroudsburg, our heads weren’t in the right place.”Despite a solid defensive showing and decent passing, Harvard struggled to score points when it needed to. The Crimson averaged a team attack percentage of only .161, .062, and .161 in the first, second, and third games, respectively.“We’re just having a hard time scoring points on offense,” Baise said. “We’d like to be, as a team, around .250 and .300, and that’s the stat that really matters.” NO. 1 PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 0Penn State showed why it is the current number one team in the country, decisively beating Harvard in a 3-0 (30-13, 30-13, 30-20) sweep on Friday night at Rec Hall in State College, Penn.“Penn State is a really great team,” sophomore Shaun Mansour said. “It was a great atmosphere, we had fun, and competed well, and that’s really what matters.”Nittany Lion senior all-American blocker Max Holt finished with a perfect 1.000 hitting percentage for the second consecutive game, leading all players with 12 kills. Junior Max Lipsitz played equally well opposite Holt, also recording a perfect hitting percentage. Overall, 12 Penn State players each had at least one kill and the Lions averaged a phenomenal team attack of .673 over three games, amassing a total of 45 kills to only 6 errors.“They’re really tall,” Rosier said. “Walking out on the court, it’s like you’re walking into a forest of redwoods.”Ivica led all Crimson players with 12 kills, while Weissbourd put up a fight with nine kills of his own. Junior co-captain Gil Weintraub was the sole distributor, dishing out 29 assists in the losing effort.“For a lot of players, especially for some of the guys that could’ve played in really big programs like Penn State, they took the loss really hard because it was a chance for them to showcase their game on a national venue,” Rosier said.Coming off of a thrilling come-from-behind victory over East Stroudsburg last weekend, Harvard came out strong and appeared intent on pulling the upset after kills by Weissbourd, Ivica, and freshman Matt Jones kept Harvard matched point-for-point.With the first game tied 7-7, hopes for an upset abruptly came to an end, as the Lions woke up from their slumber and scored 12 straight points. Penn State finished with a jaw-dropping 18 kills and only one error for a .810 team attack percentage and a service error by Jones ended the first match, 30-13.“Their passing was very solid,” Rosier said. “Penn State played every part of the game really professionally.”Penn State’s dominating style of play would continue in the second game. The Lions got off to a roaring start and never looked back after building an 18-4 lead. Facing elimination in the third game, Harvard would not relent, and the club continued to cling to a 4-1 lead early on. Despite a valiant effort by the Crimson players, the Lions’ might was too much for Harvard to handle in the final game.“We had a really hard time receiving their serves, and when you do that against a team that blocks as well as they do, it’s impossible to score points,” Baise said.And though a loss against a top team like Penn State added one more number to the loss column, Harvard relished the experience of playing on a big stage.“We’ve never played in gyms this big, in front of crowds this big, and against guys this big,” Rosier said. “You don’t get a chance to play a top-10 team very often.”—Staff writer Kevin T.

This past weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team traveled to Hanover, N.H. to play in the ECAC Team Championship. The three-day tournament was hosted by Ivy League foe Dartmouth and included seven of the eight Ivies.Seeded No. 4 in the draw, the Crimson (1-2) fell, 4-3, in the first round to the Big Green (1-5), but rebounded and dominated Cornell (3-2) 6-1 in the fifth-place match. Up first on Harvard’s schedule was fifth-seeded Dartmouth. Last season, the Crimson ended its 2008 campaign by losing to the Big Green, 4-3, in Hanover. On Friday, history seemed to repeat itself. Despite a tenacious effort, Harvard fell again to Dartmouth, 4-3.The Crimson battled the Big Green in competitive doubles matches. Unfortunately, in the No. 1 and No. 2 positions, Crimson pairs fell, giving Dartmouth the first point of the match. At No. 1, senior Beier Ko and sophomore Agnes Sibilski lost 8-6, and at No. 2, sophomore Samantha Rosekrans and freshman Caroline Davis were barely defeated 9-8 (4) in an intensely close match. But Harvard did have a bright spot at No. 3 doubles where the freshman tandem of Camille Jania and Samantha Gridley topped their opponents 8-4.After doubles, the Crimson was down by a point; thus to gain victory over the Big Green, Harvard had to win four of the singles matches. Exchanging wins and losses with Dartmouth, No. 1 Ko, No. 3 Jania, and No. 6 Sibilski all gained points in singles.  Ko defeated Molly Scott in straight sets, 6-2, 7-6(1) and Jania easily came out on top in straight sets against Jesse Adler, 6-3, 6-4. Sibilski, at No. 6, faced a tough challenge against Ryan Reichel, but ultimately overcame her and won in three sets, 7-6, 2-6, 6-2. The Crimson battled to the end, winning half of the single matches, but it was not enough to get the win, and the Big Green escaped by a narrow margin.  “We didn’t do much wrong in the matches,” captain Laura Peterzan said. “They are a good team and the difference was only by a couple of points.”With the loss to Dartmouth, Harvard received a bye on Saturday. The Crimson resumed play against the Big Red Sunday morning, which gave Harvard time to recover and come back strong.    “It was a very close match with Dartmouth—actually a heartbreaker—and we just lost by a couple of points,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “It was a tough loss, but we bounced back on Sunday.”A rejuvenated Harvard defeated Cornell in an overwhelming 6-1 victory. Crimson doubles recovered from Friday and won at No. 1 and No. 3. In the top spot, Ko and Sibilski earned a sound 8-4 win, and at No. 3 Jania and Gridley triumphed 8-2. Harvard then dominated singles play with victories all down the line from No. 1 to No. 5, including wins in straight sets from No. 1 through No. 4. Sibilski, at No. 5, battled Shayna Miller and won in a close three-set match 7-5, 5-7, 10-6. Standout Ko did not disappoint either, bageling Natalia Sanchez in the first set and earning a 6-0, 6-1 overall.“Beier Ko and Peterzan led the way,” Green said. “Beier got out there and tore through her opponent very quickly. Laura was able to grind out a tough match to take us to 3-0. Camille then clinched the match, ensuring victory.”Despite the close loss to the Big Green, the Crimson finished the weekend on a high note. Jania did especially well this weekend, boasting a 4-0 record overall.“Everyone did well this weekend,” Peterzan said. “It was a team effort and if we keep improving we will be even more successful.”“I was really happy with the way the team bounced back,” Green said. “We stuck together and worked on getting an early lead.”The resilient Harvard squad is improving with each match. After close losses to Boston University and Dartmouth, the Crimson turned it around and took a step in the right direction.“We did really great and definitely got learning experience,” Peterzan said.

Friday the 13th is usually a day to beware, but the Harvard men’s hockey team beat the dark superstitions with a 3-2 win against Colgate on Friday night at Bright Hockey Center. The victory over the Raiders (9-16-5, 4-11-3 ECAC) initiated a weekend sweep of two opponents the team trailed in the ECAC standings. The Crimson (7-14-4, 7-7-4 ECAC) is now tied for sixth in the league.Sophomore Chris Huxley launched the game-winning goal on a power play in the final frame, and sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll tallied his first collegiate win with 29 saves overall.“It was a good win,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I thought we started the game excellently, I thought we really moved the puck and cut the jump out of the gates...We responded well to a little bit of adversity with them coming back.”Sophomore Michael Biega put Harvard on the board just 90 seconds into the first period. Picking up a pass from freshman Ryan Grimshaw, Michael Biega carried the puck down the left slot and made a tricky move to shake his defender. When Colgate goaltender Brian Bessette locked him out at the left post, Michael Biega skated around the back of the net and wrapped the puck around the post to make the score 1-0.The Crimson doubled its lead less than a minute later with senior Nick Coskren’s team-leading seventh goal. Senior Steve Rolecek launched a shot from the right faceoff circle after co-captain Jimmy Fraser slid him the puck. Bessette got in front of Rolecek’s attempt, but Coskren was there to hammer home the rebound to boost Harvard to a 2-0 lead.Although Colgate outshot the Crimson 12-10 in the first frame, Harvard kept the Raiders out of its defensive zone for the majority of the period, with blueliners Alex Biega and co-captain Brian McCafferty holding Colgate in the neutral zone.The second period began with a pair of power plays for both sides, but neither team managed to convert. Colgate came out swinging and turned up the pressure against the defense, with junior David McIntyre and senior Tom Riley taking tough shots against Carroll.“[Carroll] was pretty solid, and he was good with his rebound control, so I think he made a lot of good saves tonight, and he gave us a chance to win,” Donato said.But even though Harvard limited the Raiders’ chances, Colgate still managed to break through, as senior blueliner Jason Fredericks knocked a wrist shot into the back of the net at 14:01 in the middle frame, narrowing Harvard’s lead to one, 2-1.“[In the second period,] we didn’t play as well as we played in the first,” Donato said. “I wasn’t concerned with the shots because as far as scoring chances, I thought we did a good job of limiting them. [But] I think we could’ve done a better job in finishing the game as far as giving them opportunities via turnovers.”The Crimson attempted to extend its lead on the man-advantage, as the final period opened with a Harvard power play. Alex Biega fired a shot from the center, but Bessettte knocked it away. Sophomore Pier-Olivier Michaud tried to cash in the rebound but couldn’t quite turn it around the post.When the power play expired, Colgate mounted the charge, and McIntyre finished off a pass from sophomore Brian Day at 2:48 to knot the score at two.But sophomore Chris Huxley broke the third-period tie against Colgate on a power play at 10:42. Harvard won the faceoff and after passing around the outskirts of the offensive zone, sophomore Matt McCollem picked up a pass from freshman Daniel Moriarty and sent the puck from the right to sophomore Chris Huxley in the center. Huxley launched a shot through traffic and into the right pocket of the net to reclaim the lead and secure a Crimson victory, 3-2.“McCollem came up the wall, and so I snuck in a little bit and he passed it right through a guy—it was a great pass,” Huxley said of his goal. “I was going to pass over to [junior Doug] Rogers, but the guy took the pass away and so I just shot on net, hop[ing] for a tip or something.”Harvard faces St. Lawrence on Friday night on the road.—Staff writer Courtney D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a long time since the Harvard men’s hockey team felt this good about its game. On Saturday night at a sold-out Bright Hockey Center, the Crimson (7-14-4, 7-7-4 ECAC) upset arch-rival No. 6 Cornell in a thrilling and brutal contest. The 4-2 victory over the Big Red (15-6-4, 10-5-3) was the second win of the weekend and could be just the boost Harvard needs to get on a winning track as it heads towards the ECAC playoffs.
This weekend marked the first time since November that the Crimson triumphed in back-to-back games.
“The positive momentum from [Friday night] to tonight is a real building block and hopefully we’ll keep it going,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “There’s no rest for the weary.”
In the Beanpot, the Crimson suffered heartbreaking, one-goal losses to nationally-ranked rivals Boston College and Boston University. The story was different against Cornell.
The first period started as expected with the rivals exchanging aggressive checks and extra shoves after whistles. Despite five penalties in the period, neither team could capitalize on power play chances. Harvard’s sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll faced traffic in the crease but stuffed all attempts on net. Cornell’s Ben Scrivens, one of the frontrunners for the Hobey Baker Award for the best college hockey player in the nation, looked comfortable between the pipes, positioning himself well to deflect Crimson attempts on goal.
In the second period, the pace picked up, with Harvard getting on the scoreboard first. On the power play, junior Doug Rogers found freshman Alex Killorn on the right side of the net. Killorn, who appeared to be in a passing position, sent a wrist shot on frame that squeezed between the post and Scriven’s right side. The Big Red, however, quickly tied the game back up when Colin Greening rifled in the first of his two goals on the night.
Late in the second, sophomore Matt McCollem scored the prettiest goal of the game. After speeding past a defenseman, McCollem received a perfect pass from Rogers and found himself one-on-one with the goaltender. He deked left, pulled the puck to the right, and caught Scrivens off guard with a backhand shot into the right side.
The Crimson extended its lead in the final period after freshman Daniel Moriarty fired a one-time slap shot past Scrivens.
After scoring and narrowing the gap to one, Cornell put heavy pressure on Carroll in an attempt to earn the tying goal, but the defense stayed physical and disruptive.
“You have guys doing things that are tough,” Donato said. “Blocking shots, taking hits to get pucks out. It’s what winning teams do, and I’m really proud of the way we battled today.”
Senior Nick Coskren sealed the 4-2 victory for Harvard with an empty netter with 12 seconds remaining.
“We’re excited about the win,” Donato said. “It was a good hard-fought battle. We knew it was going to be a game that was going to be very tight and a lot of momentum changes.”
The Crimson was perfect on the penalty kill and tallied all four of its goals on the power play. Scoring four goals was quite a feat for Harvard, considering Scrivens is probably the top goaltender in the nation this season. Coming into the game, the junior was first in the nation with six shutouts and a .942 save percentage. He was also second in the country with a 1.57 goals-against average.
Despite the impressive resume, Scrivens was outplayed by Carroll, who won first star honors on Saturday.
“Today [Carroll] made a couple of spectacular saves on their power play,” Donato said. “He kept us in there at times and allowed us to get that third goal, which was a big one.”
Carroll, in just the third start of his career, made 42 stops and protected the lead for a Harvard team that was outshot 44-24. Carroll has seized the role of starting goaltender with several solid performances this past week.
“I was just working hard everyday,” Carroll said. “I was just waiting for the call and it finally came. And now I’m performing.”
The victory may prove to be a turning point for the Crimson as it looks to finish the ECAC season strong and make a run through the playoffs. 
Harvard just missed upsetting nationally ranked powerhouses B.C. and B.U. this month, and the win against a top-ten team in Cornell may provide the extra bit of confidence the team needs to challenge the ECAC leaders.
“Four points in any weekend is great, but especially having gone through what we have been through, I think its especially important,” Donato said. “We really have our eyes focused on getting home ice in the first round.”
Home ice will be especially important for the Crimson. This season, Harvard is 7-1-1 at home in ECAC play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the dying seconds of Saturday night’s game, Harvard freshman Brogan Berry’s runner bounced off the glass before seeming to touch every inch of metal. As the ball swirled around the rim, the anxious faces of the Crimson players on the bench told the whole story: the team simply needed the shot to fall. But the nervousness soon turned to dejection. As the ball fell, not through the net but into the grip of Columbia’s Judie Lomax, Harvard lost its grip on the ability to control its own destiny.Saturday’s 74-71 loss in Lavietes Pavilion puts a serious damper on the Crimson’s hopes for an Ivy League crown. Harvard (13-8, 5-2 Ivy) now finds itself two games behind league-leading Dartmouth.The defeat marred an incredible weekend performance by sophomore Emma Markley. The forward followed up her 18-point, 10-rebound game against Cornell on Friday with yet another double-double. Markley led all scorers with 27, matching her career high. She added 14 rebounds and eight blocks—both career highs as well.“She has a post player’s body but can spring faster than any guard out there,” co-captain Emily Tay said of Markley.With the two teams trading leads down the stretch, Columbia (11-11, 4-4) put the pressure on the Crimson with some sharp shooting from behind the arc.First, Lions’ guard Sara Yee answered a Tay layup with a three. Then, after Berry hit a tough runner in the lane to give Harvard a 63-62 advantage, Columbia’s Katrina Cragg knocked down a three of her own.With three minutes to go, Berry drove and was able to get straight to the hoop to tie the score. But another Lions’ three—this time from Melissa Shafer—put Columbia up 68-65.On the ensuing possession, a missed layup from Tay was rebounded by the Lions’ Lauren Dwyer. A second later, Tay and Markley combined for the steal. Markley laid the ball in, got the foul, and made the free throw to get the crowd on its feet.After two made free throws by Lomax, the next Crimson possession saw Berry feed the ball inside to sophomore Claire Wheeler, who quickly dished it to Markley for a layup. The beautiful passing tied the score once again with a minute and a half remaining.Columbia continued to find answers, and a layup from Lomax put her team back in front. Following a 30-second timeout, Berry was able to break the press, drawing a foul that sent her to the line.Berry—one of the league’s best from the charity stripe—was short on her first shot. “The free throw was so unlike her,” Tay said. “She’ll probably not miss another one for the rest of the year.”Berry, though, was able to collect herself and hit the second to pull Harvard to within one.Knowing that it needed a stop, the Crimson stood strong on the defensive end of the floor, forcing a bad Lions miss. However, Columbia grabbed the offensive board and was able to call timeout with five seconds left on the shot clock.Off the inbounds, the Lions were still unable to find an opening. But right as the shot clock struck zero, a debatable foul call on Berry sent Dwyer to the line.Dwyer made the first but missed the second, giving Harvard the ball, down two, with twenty seconds left.The final Crimson possession saw both Berry and Tay try to create room for their own shot. The ball wound up in the hands of the freshman point guard, and Berry did everything right except get lucky. Despite the Harvard bench and fans screaming for a foul, the no-call on Berry’s runner with two seconds on the clock essentially sealed the Crimson’s fate.The final miss seemed an unjust ending yet again for Berry, who finished with 14 points. In both of Harvard’s two losses this season, the freshman has had the ball in her hands on the final possession. Neither time did the Crimson get the result it was hoping for, but the decisions indicate the level of trust that Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has in her point guard.“We like the ball in Brogan’s hands,” Delaney-Smith said.The last five minutes were played out with incredible tension and drama, but those in attendance may have been biting their nails in the first half for entirely different reasons.Despite expecting the Columbia press, the Crimson simply did not deal with the pressure in the opening period. Harvard turned the ball over 16 times in a sloppy first half.“We don’t blame anybody but ourselves,” Delaney-Smith said.The fact that the Crimson went into the break down only six was largely due to the play of Markley. When her guards did manage to break the press, Markley was there to finish, scoring 14 points before the break.Tay joined Markley and Berry in double figures for the game, adding 10 points to the effort.—Staff writer Jay M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The dreaded curse of Friday the 13th did not seem to faze the Harvard women’s basketball team against Cornell this past weekend. The Crimson (13-8, 5-2 Ivy) came out strong against the Big Red (7-13, 3-5 Ivy), as it gained the lead five minutes into the game and held on for the duration to win, 75-57.Harvard’s starting five accounted for all but nine of the team’s 75 points, shooting 52 percent from the field and making 18-of-23 free throws. Co-captain Emily Tay was Harvard’s sparkplug, electrifying the crowd and her teammates alike at key points in the game when momentum was up for grabs. Tay finished with 14 points, five rebounds, eight assists, and four steals.The team’s leading scorer, sophomore Emma Markley, posted her fifth double-double of the season. She finished impressively with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and two blocks. Markley helped her team get off to a great start, delivering a crushing block 90 seconds after the opening tip-off and scoring the Crimson’s first nine points of the game.“Emma Markley, when she starts strong, is really tough to defend,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “If [she] is feeling good, she’s going to score in several different ways.”“I think to start off, we ran the floor pretty well,” Markley added.Sophomore forward Claire Wheeler, who started in place of the injured Katie Rollins, made a large contribution with her inside presence, which amounted to nine rebounds and four hard-earned points from under the basket.Cornell was strong from beyond the arc, racking up more than half of their overall points from 3-point range. Agile Big Red guard Lauren Benson silenced the crowd multiple times after draining jumpers from downtown. But Harvard always had an answer for Cornell’s sharpshooting.Tay and Markley led the Crimson early as they crafted a 15-3 run that ended midway through the second half. In the opening minutes, Cornell’s Benson sunk a long jumper and dished to forward Shanna Scarselletta for an easy layup the next trip down the floor. Tay answered with an assist to Markley in stride, who picked up a foul as she hit a floater from the paint. Harvard’s constant “attack” mentality enabled them to neutralize many of Cornell’s potentially costly baskets.“We started stronger than we have been,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re not there yet, but it wasn’t bad. I thought we weathered their runs of momentum well.”Crimson guards, freshman Brogan Berry and co-captain Niki Finelli, both scored 15 points and shot 100% from the free throw line.With four of five starters in double digits, Harvard was able to maintain its lead over the Big Red even as it narrowed the score to four points with nine minutes left in the game.Much of the second half was the Tay show. She used her repertoire of fade-aways, spin moves, and reverse layups to overcome heavy traffic in the paint, as well as some questionable calls from the referees. With many pairs of hot hands on the floor and a fully engaged home crowd, the Crimson fended off Cornell and coasted to victory.The team showed great poise on Friday night by focusing on the task that lay ahead.“We definitely need to focus on having a stronger start,” Markley said. “I think we did pretty well this game.”The Crimson has seven games to go, one against each Ivy. As one of the main contenders for the Ivy League title this year, Harvard must continue to strive for consistency.
