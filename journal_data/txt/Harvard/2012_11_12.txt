After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard welcomed Boston jazz heroes Eric Jackson, Steve Schwartz, and Fred Taylor for a panel and a concert. The three have been promoting jazz on the air and around town for decades and still remain vital to Boston's jazz scene. The Arts board asked them to come up with the best places in town to find jazz, either in clubs, on the radio, or in record stores. Here's what they gave us:
Scullers Jazz Club 
Housed in a Doubletree hotel just across the Charles, Scullers, where Fred Taylor serves as entertainment director, welcomes both huge international acts and local phenoms. And they have weeknight student tickets for only ten dollars—a steal for a jazz show.
Regattabar 
This fabled jazz club has its home in the chic Charles Hotel just off Eliot Street. National acts come through on a weekly basis.
The Lily Pad 
An intimate room at Inman Square, the Lily Pad is great for those on a budget who like underground, sometimes esoteric jazz and music of other genres (i.e. hipsters).
Wally's Cafe 
Wally's is located right by Berklee College of Music on Mass. Ave. in Boston and hosts weekly jam sessions with free admission. It's a great place to check out some of the younger players on the scene.
WGBH 89.7/WHRB 95.3 FM 
Sadly, WGBH recently cut the majority of its jazz programming. But you can still listen to Eric Jackson's jazz show, "Eric in the Evening," every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night. For the rest of the week, jazzheads can tune in to Harvard's own WHRB, which has morning jazz every weekday from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Although Harvard students are no strangers to computer-synthesized sounds in house-party dubstep, a union between technology and classical music may seem a little odd. Even though Pulitzer-Prize-winning composer Roger Reynolds is renowned for his work in classical music compositions, the orchestral symphonies and quartets he develops are strikingly different from Debussy’s “Claire de Lune” or Mozart’s “Requiem.” By using his background in engineering physics to write his compositions, Reynolds has engaged with electronic influences on natural sounds to develop seemingly impossible audio patterns designed to engage multiple senses.
Currently residing in Mather House as the Artist in Residence, Reynolds is teaching courses as the Fromm Foundation Visiting Composer and has been composing the project “george WASHINGTON,” revolving around George Washington’s own words and soundscapes from Mount Vernon.  A selection of his work will be presented in “Roger Reynolds: A Portrait Concert” on Thursday, December 6 at 8:00 pm in John Knowles Paine Concert Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: When you started, your piece “Watershed IV” (1995) was the first classical music DVD designed for surround sound. In what way has modern technology influenced your work?
Roger Reynolds: The computer was capable immediately of doing anything that you knew how to ask it to do. It’s really not so much that the technology is new, but that approaches to the use of the power of computation have changed. Things that used to be extremely computationally intensive still are done in more or less the same ways that they were done before, but they can be done much more rapidly. A computer musician can be onstage and can perform with guitarists or a string quartet, and there is no issue anymore in speed, in capacity, in reliability—all these things that used to be deadly are now relatively trivial. This has resulted in me getting involved in a lot of real-time processing.
THC: What influences has your work abroad, in Japan and in Germany—had on your current work—particularly your project “george WASHINGTON”?
RR: You realize that just in general...artists in those contexts are almost inevitably very conscious of history and, I think it’s probably fair to say, there’s a responsibility to history. In this country, the attitude that artists have toward tradition is much more varied, and I would say that the impact that living in other societies has had for me has just been to generalize and enrich the variability with which one thinks about things…. Once we came back to this country and decided to live in California, I’d say that the impact of European or Asian ideals became less consciously important, and in fact the George Washington work represents a swing almost to the opposite pole…. I have found the research necessary to create the text for this piece [to be] an extraordinary and very rewarding experience.
THC: What challenges have you faced as a composer in America?
RR: The reality is that we have a vastly greater number of options about what we can do with our time.... Music is discursive art, and it takes time. We all live incredibly busy and congested lives, and it is harder and harder to devote the amount of time necessary to go to a concert…. The challenge is that concert music life in this country is dominated by fairly dire economic problems, so this means that the work that is more likely to be fostered is work which is more likely to be economically neutral…. This means that more innovative things are less likely to get a hearing. I think the American situation now very strongly privileges work that is less challenging, so that’s a challenge to me, because I’m not interested in work that is not moving ideas or moving, at least, me in some interesting way.
THC: In what way do you see modern classical music shaping or entering into dialogue with pop culture?
RR: Boundaries are disintegrating.  There’s such a variety of ways in which people are doing their work, and I suppose that’s a good thing. But on the other hand it’s clearly going to have very complex consequences because the advantages of the genre—the advantages of focus—are obvious, and as soon as you start exercising more and more options, it’s harder and harder to explain what you’re doing… to have people prepare to actually grapple with it on a serious level. These are exciting times, and I’m a great believer in the importance of opportunity, and we have that. The problem is that opportunity is not one-dimensional.

From their list of ensemble members, which includes the likes of Curious George and Hannah Montana, to their program notes, which come with an “addendum for philistines,” the Brattle Street Chamber Players seem to be out on a mission to dispel the notion that classical music is an uptight, outmoded genre. But don’t let the quirky program fool you: when it comes to the actual music, the Players mean business. Their thoughtful performance married technical skill with emotional power in a show that dazzled.
The first piece of the evening was Mozart’s “Divertimento in F, K. 138.” From the first bracing notes, the Players captured the audience’s attention with their rousing, spirited rendition. The ensemble brought the necessary energy to the upbeat piece without drowning out the many interconnected threads. In the first movement Allegro, the balance between the sweet violins and the busily working cellos beneath was exquisite and kept the piece’s many parts from sounding garbled or overwrought. But the Players can do delicate too, and the softer passages in the Presto movement evinced this. In the Andante movement, the tempo they chose allowed the Players to extract the notes’ bittersweet nuances, recalling at times the poignancy of Bach’s “Air on the G String.” Still, the Players never let the piece get bogged down in excessive sentiment: it floated along, always kept light and moving.
The second piece, Lydia W. Brindamour ’13’s “The Bones of Things”—the work’s premier—could not have been further from Mozart. The churchlike silence of the concert hall was shattered by what sounded like a string snapping. Underneath this was a thin sound like a faraway train passing by. Combined with chaotic notes and the thump of bows slapping against strings, the effect was a thrilling, chilling, fascinating piece that made the listener constantly wonder how on earth the Players were creating those sounds. The piece resembled a horror-movie soundtrack, at times evoking the feeling of bugs crawling on your skin. True to its title, “The Bones of Things” is spare, but what’s there is packed with meaning. The long stretches of silence gave extra weight to the sparse notes, and the eerie, unearthly jumble of sounds was punctuated here and there by a single perfect, plaintive note that took on a haunting quality by virtue of its singularity. The piece could not have succeeded, however, without the precise, meticulous execution of the Players, who drew out the tension in the air, reeling in the audience where a sloppier performance would have allowed listeners to simply reject the piece altogether for its peculiarity.
The last piece of the night was Arthur Schoenberg’s “Verklärte Nacht” (Transfigured Night), and it managed to look tame in comparison with what came before it. While Schoenberg is famous for his atonal style, his earlier works, such as this one, seem far more conventional to modern ears, though at the time of its publication, the inclusion of a “nonexistent” chord stirred up controversy among the Austrian artistic establishment. The piece’s beginning is darkly brooding, but the melody is soon whipped up into a frenzy. Thanks to the Players’ careful rendering, things never careened out of control: they were able to take even overwrought passages and sail them down into sweet, dreamy melodies. A violin solo by Keir D. Gogwilt ’13 was entrancing, capturing the pathos of the piece without overwhelming the performance with theatrics. As ever, the skill of the ensemble let every element of the composition shine: while the nimble finale had a hypnotic quality, the violin that sung above it was truly gorgeous. The Players unified the piece’s many different sections to create a rendition that was powerfully affecting.
The Players’ Fall Concert showcased music from a variety of different eras and styles, and the group tackled each one with equal energy, giving precise performances that still managed to pack an emotional punch. From the first note to the last, they had the audience spellbound. If the tongue-in-cheek program was an attempt to reel in viewers, the powerful show sealed the deal.

UPDATED: Nov. 14, 2012, at 3:58 p.m.
“The history of the world, my sweet,” the title character of “Sweeney Todd” sings to his landlady, “is who gets eaten and who gets to eat.”
For some, that message may be hard to swallow. But Sweeney takes that survival-of-the-fittest dictum quite literally, chopping up enemies, informants, and random passersby for his landlady to bake into meat pies. In the hands of director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13 (who is also an inactive Crimson arts writer) and a dedicated cast and crew, “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street”—which runs through Nov. 18—is a wickedly funny feast for carnivorous theater-goers.
As Sweeney—a barber who returns to London after 15 years of undeserved exile to find that his wife has poisoned herself and his daughter is about to be forced into marriage—Eric Padilla ’14 embarks on a chilling quest to slit the throat of the man behind his misfortunes. Throughout almost every sort of stimulation, from the cries of men as he slays them to the caresses of a woman professing her love for him, Padilla’s Sweeney remains unmoved, his focus fixed only on revenge. Padilla’s one-note performance is unerringly eerie.
Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 delivers the standout performance of the evening in the role of Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney’s partner in cannibalistic cookery. A flurry of energy with a perfect London accent, Leimkuhler wows in her many complex songs. Giving the most wholly sad performance of the tragicomic show as Tobias Ragg, Alistair A. Debling ’16 ends the musical with a broken, sniveling monologue on a stage strewn with dead bodies. That final, terrible moment is enhanced by lighting design which makes each actor ghostly pale and leaves the set the color of charcoal save only the fierce red mouth of a glowing furnace.
Packed with complicated Stephen Sondheim songs that overlap each other throughout the show, “Sweeney Todd” benefits from the energetic sound of a 13-member student pit orchestra under the music direction of Sam R. Schoenberg ’13. But many lyrics are difficult to make out due to a combination of imbalanced microphones and actors’ poor diction. The chorus that appears between scenes aims to seem solemn, given the gruesome nature of the tale they sing, but often simply looks cowed thanks to hunched shoulders and mumbling voices.
A multi-layered set constructed of jagged wooden beams by Madelynne A. Hays ’13 and Isabel Strauss ’13 is used well throughout the performance, clearly marking off separate spaces like Sweeney’s salon and Mrs. Lovett’s pie shop on the same stage.
Many people die in “Sweeney Todd.” Good people and bad people; people who were targets of murder and those who just stepped in its path; people who perish by gunshot and by burning and by strangulation and of course by barber’s blade. McTaggart left his signature on this production by marking each of those deaths with a shrill alarm and a flood of red light. Some of the murders come after an excruciating lead-up; others Sweeney commits with cavalier suddenness on his riser even as Mrs. Lovett careens around her busy pie shop below. The siren and stained backdrop levels all these tragedies, signifying again and again their common horror.
For all of the production’s impressive technical elements, booming vocals, and darkly funny turns of phrase, the real star of this grisly show about the Demon Barber of Fleet Street is perhaps death itself, that silent menace voiced here in a siren’s blare and served up in a pie.

Don’t be surprised if the characters in “El Misterio de Irma Vap” look alike; all of them, both male and female, are played by only two actors. The show—which was directed by Miriam E. Psychas ’13 and ran at the Adams Pool Theater from November 8 to 10—was a production filled with humorous and bizarre scenes that tell the tale of the haunting of wealthy Mexican estate. Like many TEATRO! productions, the play was completely done in Spanish—although the original version, written by Charles Ludlam in 1984 was in English.  “Irma Vap” succeeded in humorously poking fun at Telenovelas and typical Hispanic stock characters through solid acting and well executed, purposefully cheesy sound effects.
The play follows Lord Edgar (Enzo V. Toral ’14), his wife Lady Enid (Joao A. Vogel ’16), his servant Nicodemo (Vogel), and the family maid Jane (Toral) as they begin to unravel the dark history of Edgar’s past. Filled with stories of werewolves, mummies, and the walking dead, the plot gets thicker and more convoluted as the characters reveal both their intentions and their inner demons, literally.
Toral took charge of the stage from the very beginning: even his body language demanded attention.  The Pool has a lot of room for just two actors, but Toral knew to pace the stage and use many grand hand gestures to hide that fact and to fill the space up with his character’s personality. For example, Toral started the show as Jane, a stereotypical gossipy, stressed, and uptight maid similar to the ones found in many Spanish novellas. He used dramatic facial expressions and voice fluctuations to brings that character to life. When Jane explained the family’s haunted history to Enid, Toral used exaggerated whispers, often hanging on a specific word, to highlight the spookiness of the story and the ridiculousness of the situation.
Vogel was far less believable as an actual female character than Toral, but he also has his shining moments as the funny yet annoying spouse Lady Enid. He is constantly adjusting his fake boobs or laughing as he toys with his far too extravagant blonde wig. Some shows might have actors who try to believably portray characters of the opposite sex, but In “Irma Vap” the costumes were so purposefully simple that it was obvious the cross-dressing was purely for comic effect. The use of cross-dressing to get laughs was made explicit throughout the production, and is even found in the script. For example, at one point Vogel as Lady Enid says “Qualquier hombre que se viste como mujer no puede ser tan malo,” meaning, “Any man that dresses like a woman can’t be so bad.” Admitting the play’s oddities and putting them out in the open is ironic and witty, and this self-awareness becomes one of the key components in making the play so humorous.
The tacky sound effects added the finishing touches that made “Irma Vap” an entertaining piece of theater. Sound designers Marisol E. Herrera ’13 and David R. Grieder ’14 employed well known sounds from horror movies—such as the infamous track that accompanies the shower scene in  “Psycho”—to underscore supposedly terrible events. However, these noises were all obviously out of place and were cut off bluntly without any fading or transition. These effects added a sense of humor and self awareness to the show that created a fun atmosphere while simultaneously exaggerating the drama of the production.
“El Misterio de Irma Vap” succeeded brilliantly thanks to its marvelous actors, silly sounds, and hilariously overdone drama. The cast and crew managed to not only bring a typical telenovela to the stage, but also to fulfill TEATRO!’s aim of bringing Latin American theater to a wider audience.

For those who favor liberalization of controls on marijuana, America’s most widely used illicit drug, Tuesday’s election gave us a lot to be happy about. With Colorado and Washington both voting in ballot measures to move toward legalization of marijuana for non-medical purposes, the United States will become on December 6 one of the very few countries in the world where the drug is legal. That is unless the federal government moves and succeeds in blocking the states from enacting laws that conflict with the continuing federal prohibition on cannabis. Here in Massachusetts, voters approved by a wide margin to legalize the use and distribution of medical marijuana. While a step in the right direction, we would prefer full legalization for medical and recreational purposes for several reasons.
Medical marijuana does appear to serve a legitimate use in pain management. From coping with chronic pain, to recovering from a serious illness, to dealing with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, marijuana can serve a highly useful purpose for patients. Despite this function, medical marijuana outlets clearly also serve as an avenue for recreational users to exploit. In all likelihood the vast majority of outlets and dispensaries have no intention of acting as a backdoor to getting high without a medical need. However, evidence suggests that prescriptions are often easy to obtain, and medical marijuana has ended up cloaking the failed prohibition of marijuana for recreational use. The public’s approach to the industry actually resembles closely at times the U.S.’s addiction to prescription painkillers like Percocet and OxyContin. So long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law, medical outlets will retain the tainted reputation of abuse by those who don’t really need their products.
The sensible option from here is to move forward with full legalization of marijuana use for medical and non-medicinal purposes by adults. Given federal intransigence on this subject, it makes sense for proponents of legalization to continue to move forward on a state-by-state basis. Over time, the stance of the Justice Department should evolve to accept that marijuana use is simply too widespread and increasingly accepted to be the focus of the failed “war on drugs.”
If Colorado and Washington are permitted to move forward with their citizens’ wishes, the aim of regulating marijuana dispensaries and forbidding public consumption could become a model for the rest of the nation, including Massachusetts. As has been stated many times before, legalization can bring money out of the hands of drug dealers and gangsters and into those of law-abiding individuals and public coffers. The disastrous situation in Mexico would improve. The U.S. could quit sending hundreds of thousands to prison, of whom black and Latino men make up a disproportionate number, for relatively harmless offenses.
Most importantly, perhaps, legalization of private marijuana use and small possession would end a sad episode of excessive government intrusion into Americans’ lives. Like alcohol and tobacco, marijuana can be dangerous. But it is not cocaine or heroine, and it does not carry with it the same potential for a breakdown in civil society. If someone wants to light up a joint in their own home, it does not seem reasonable for authorities to tell him or her not to. Massachusetts may put itself on a collision course with the feds, but legalization of marijuana for recreational use is the right move forward. And medical marijuana could serve only the patients who really need it.

Undergraduates, as you select the next President and Vice President of the Undergraduate Council this week, you will also have the power to vote “yes” on a referendum asking the University to establish a Social Choice Fund within Harvard’s endowment. Harvard’s historical investments in companies with poor social and environmental standards have created an urgent need for this fund. To show support for investing according to environmental, social, and corporate governance criteria, donors to the University would be able to earmark their gifts to the endowment. Under the leadership of graduates from the classes of 1962 and 1985, the alumni effort in favor of an ESG fund is well underway. If implemented, the fund will allow Harvard to consider global issues while raising the money it needs to provide exceptional research and educational opportunities to students.
By voting “yes” on this referendum, you can amplify our voices and proactively ask our University for socially responsible investments. While the Advisory Committee for Shareholder Responsibility allows for student input on investment issues, its power remains limited. Supporting the referendum will show Harvard’s leaders that we are concerned about our investment practices and the long-term success of the University—and that we are calling for reform.
Since the 1980s, the student body has occasionally protested some of Harvard’s investments, such as those in companies that supported apartheid in South Africa and genocide in Darfur. However, these calls for change have always been reactive rather than proactive. The current method of investing the endowment needs reform in order to avoid these risks in the future. Rather than urging the school to divest from specific companies, students and alumni should encourage the Harvard Management Company, which manages the endowment, to invest responsibly.
According to University President Drew G. Faust, the HMC’s primary purpose is to generate returns on the endowment. She told students, “That is its sustaining goal and it devotes itself to that, not to using the investments to advance particular agendas of one sort or another.” However, the aims of a social choice fund align with those of the HMC. Making money and doing good do not have to be mutually exclusive. To date, chief executive officers and corporations around the world with combined assets of over $30 trillion have signed the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment, including Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of the HMC. In 2011, his company, PIMCO—a global investment management firm—signed on to these international regulations. Erika Karp, the Head of Global Sector Research at UBS Investment Bank wrote in an email to members of Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, “In terms of fundamental analyses of both risks and rewards, there is absolutely no reason to miss the opportunity for the potentially ‘enhanced analytics’ available through systematic ESG research.”
Although companies that do not fully recognize and articulate ESG issues may be more profitable in the short run, they will not be able to sustain such success in the future. Harvard’s endowment is a long-term investment, and the HMC must consider how companies will perform over many years. Companies like BP, which was once profitable for investors, faces a $25 billion judgment for the 2010 explosion on one of its drilling units  which spilled 205 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, bringing the total cost of the disaster to $55 billion for BP. The social investment firm Domini refused to invest in BP prior to the spill, citing “a pattern of safety and environmental concerns.” Investments in such unsustainable companies threaten the endowment’s long-term success as well. A social choice fund is a step toward preserving the future of Harvard’s money.
Other top schools like Hampshire, Williams, Vassar, and Mount Holyoke already have social choice funds, and Brown University became the first Ivy League school to start one in 2007. Harvard can easily join them. This is different from the demands of the Divest for Our Future campaign, which is aimed at ending ties between Harvard and fossil fuel companies. It also reinforces the need for socially responsible investment. And the Social Choice Fund can be implemented efficiently and quickly; it can yield profits matching the returns on the rest of the endowment. Numerous studies show ESG-run funds generate about the same amount of revenue as normal ones and may even do better in the long run. For example, a study comparing the S&P 500, an index of the largest publicly traded companies, to the MSCI KLD 400, an index for responsibly-screened investments, showed that the KLD 400 slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over a 20 year period.
Establishing a social choice fund will by no means solve the current issues of how the endowment is managed, but it is a modest and important first step toward getting the entire endowment to be run by ESG criteria. As students, let’s become part of the conversation on investment and vote “yes” to ask Harvard for a responsibly invested endowment.

We, the Black Community Leaders, must express how thoroughly disappointed many members of our community are at recent, public misrepresentations of affirmative action. As leaders and members of various cultural and ethnic groups on campus, it is our responsibility to respond to such blatant inaccuracies.
We were deeply disheartened by the assertion that students who benefit from affirmative action are less qualified than their peers. Aside from the fact that Harvard’s community of color is rich with exemplary students, the recent piece, “Affirmative Dissatisfaction,” also fails to recognize the importance of diversity, including the diversity of race. Furthermore, moving toward an exclusively class-based affirmative action policy, as alternatively suggested, ignores the continued importance of race in decision-making at all levels of American civil society. Unlike many in the majority race, minorities can expect to experience racially prejudiced interactions in almost every part of their daily lives, regardless of their elevated socio-economic or educational statuses. Consider the 2010 incident that occurred at a Boston bar and restaurant when a party hosted by Harvard and Yale Law School students and alumni was forced to close. The staff closed the party simply because they assumed these Black students to be “local gangbangers,” and alerted local authorities. In this situation, any privilege that may have been granted through the students’ educational status was completely discounted; the only thing that mattered to the staff was the students’ race. As long as race remains a primary social identifier and a tool of prejudice and oppression, it remains a legitimate attribute for diversification in selecting a class of students or a staff of employees. Advocating for other metrics that the college does not currently explicitly use for diversification, such as height and hair color, does not diminish societal salience of race and its everyday use.
Harvard wants a diverse student body so that people from different backgrounds can engage in discussions of importance. We should thank Harvard for getting it right. Our student body is richer for having minority racial groups on campus, as it is similarly richer for having students from Kansas and students who intend to concentrate in folklore and mythology. We do not want people to look at minorities and say we’re here simply to remedy America's ugly past; we want people to appreciate the various perspectives of minorities and what we have to offer as individuals in every space on this campus.
We acknowledge that affirmative action is not perfect and can be improved, but we contend that, in an America that has yet to move beyond race as a defining factor, it is absolutely necessary. We cannot presume to do away with affirmative action until we do away with the structural barriers that confront minority populations every day. Until we live in an America where we are not judged by the color of our skin and ethnicity, or made to believe that we are less qualified than our white counterparts, then as a community it is our responsibility to continue to protect those who are most vulnerable to the effects of racism. Columnists that conflate race-based affirmative action with lowered standards for admission such as Sarah Siskind only reinforce the need for affirmative action, for they reveal a naive understanding of the experiences of minority populations within the U.S. and the need for representation of these populations in order to engage in these discussions about their experiences.
We seek justice and racial equality for all, but we recognize as well the importance for racial diversity even where this ideal exists. For even in equality, there can be diversity. This is where Harvard admissions succeeds: “Although they come from many different places and backgrounds and have a striking variety of talents, ambitions, and convictions, all possess a passion for learning.”
Students of color across this campus are qualified and are impressive beyond measure. There is no formula for admission to this university, nor are any two applicants the same. Furthermore, admissions standards were not lowered to afford us opportunities. Instead, our work ethic in our classes, our leadership roles in various communities, our innovation that drives us forward, and our exhibition of the most promise for future contributions to society, in spite of the sentiments expressed in negative articles, are what brought us and all of Harvard’s student body to this campus. We are all Harvard students, and it is our greatest hope that all students on this campus grow to appreciate this fact and to quell divisive and stigmatizing demagoguery. This campus is not made weaker because of the presence of racial minorities (or women or Midwesterners); it is strengthened. We write, as the Black Community Leaders of recognized student organizations of the African Diaspora, to argue against widespread inaccuracies and to spur continued conversation around ways to improve race relations and perceptions for future Harvard students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I usually use this column to discuss the Middle East, but today I would like to raise a very First World issue. It is one that aggravates student life at Harvard, yet we all have unwittingly participated in it in some form or another.
By way of example, here is a conversation I overheard yesterday:
“How’s it going?”
“You know, getting four hours of sleep, but whatever. This week sucks. I have two midterms, a paper, a date event, and elections for this club I’m in.”
“Yeah, last week was like that for me and next week will be even worse. But that’s Harvard, right?”
This conversation may not seem abnormal to you. In fact, since arriving at Harvard over three years ago, I have sadly grown accustomed to hearing conversations like this. Their distinguishing feature is that they mask bragging with complaining. And let’s face it: A great deal of Harvard’s social interactions fit this mold.
The student sleeping for four hours a night was not actually complaining about her sleep schedule.  She was seeking the recognition of her peer. Presumably, the student has no intention of dropping her entirely voluntary commitments, nor is she actually seeking the advice of her friend for how to balance her responsibilities. As for the “But that’s Harvard, right?”: We have all heard that question or some variation of it many times here.
The obvious implication of that question is that if you are not filling every second of your time with Harvard’s multitude of academic and extracurricular opportunities, then you are missing out. From this perspective, Harvard is not a place for fulfillment, but rather a place for over-fulfillment. In this surreal world, free time is sinful and busyness is next to godliness.
There are many costs to Harvard’s whiny one-upmanship. I will highlight two.
The first cost is to student wellbeing. Complaining about life’s challenges can be healthy at times, but if you find that the great majority of your social interactions are more or less group whining sessions, then you are probably either unhappy or unknowingly contributing to someone else’s unhappiness.
Let me be clearer: If your lifestyle, classes, social circles, etc. are making you unhappy, then by all means reach out to family, friends, or one of Harvard’s many mental health resources. Being able to communicate about life’s difficulties is essential to good health. However, there is a difference between the quasi-bragging whining that replaces conversations for many Harvard students and genuine calls for help. Furthermore, any blurriness between those two types of communication is exacerbated by the proliferation of the former. Harvard’s whininess is symptomatic of a culture that makes the depressed feel that the lifestyle that is depressing them is normal. At least that was the case for me, as well as many others I have spoken to.
A second cost of Harvard’s whiny one-upmanship is that it replaces intellectual engagement with shallow interactions. Discussions of academics at Harvard should not revolve around an individual’s workload, but rather on the fascinating topics we are privileged to spend four years devoting ourselves to understanding. Likewise, conversations on extracurricular activities should emphasize the insights and skills they provide us instead of the sleep we lose to participate in them.
Before penning your “To the editors” (or, more realistically, anonymous online comments), let me provide two painfully obvious caveats. First of all, this whining-bragging exists elsewhere. Unlike Harvard students, though, when an adult’s social interactions are reducible to whiny one-upmanship, that adult will find social interactions hard to come by. Second, Harvard has many students that break out of this cultural mold, and the descriptions I provided above are generalizations—but accurate ones, nonetheless.
So as a reforming whiner, here is some advice as the semester heads towards its final weeks. When you are exhausted and need to complain, as we all do occasionally, then do it. However, do not make others feel that your exhaustion or busyness is some sort of virtue. Moreover, rather than complaining about that final paper you need to write, discuss the paper’s thesis with a friend.
Also, yes, I did just write a column whining about whining. Top that.
Eric T. Justin ’13, a Crimson editorial writer, is a social studies concentrator in Currier House. His column appears on alternate Mondays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reverend Jonathan L. Walton formally accepted on Sunday his role as Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister, during the eightieth anniversary service of Memorial Church’s founding.
While many attended the morning services to observe Walton’s appointment, the ceremony lasted only ten minutes. In a formalized exchange between University president and minister-apparent, University President Drew G. Faust asked Walton if he was willing to perform the responsibilities of Harvard’s religious leader, to which he replied affirmatively.
In accepting the position, Walton paid tribute to the Harvard graduates who have died in wars since World War I; the Church itself is a memorial to these alumni. “We are all beneficiaries of someone’s sacrifice,” he said. “This building honors those who paid the ultimate price in protecting our nation.”
During the service, a group of children who attend the Church School at Memorial Church—including Walton’s older children Zora Neale and Elijah Mays—presented him with a welcome banner featuring every child’s handprints.
Reverend Charles G. Adams, a minster in Detroit and former professor Harvard Divinity School, led the sermon, focusing his talk on the adage “Yes, we can.” In the talk, which preceded Walton’s institution as Pusey minister, Adams listed well-known individuals who overcame adversity in their lives—Martin Luther and Rosa Parks, for example. At the end, he listed Walton.
“One man, Jonathan Walton, has come to Harvard to preach the gospel to our nation’s future leaders,” he said.
Dean of the College Evelyn M. Hammonds, who was in attendance, said that she believes Walton will aptly lead Memorial Church during his tenure.
“The sermon today was wonderful and extraordinary. A new era is beginning at Memorial Church, and I have no doubt that the year to come will be wonderful,” she said in an interview with The Crimson immediately after the service.
Lowell House residents and sisters Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14 and Arielle G. Rabinowitz ’14 performed a piano duet at the service, after being invited to play a piece by Walton, whom the sisters know from his time as a Lowell resident scholar.
“We’ve known Reverend Walton since we first arrived in Lowell as sophomores,” Danielle said. “He, his wife Cecily, and his children Elijah and Zora were such a huge part of the House community.”
Jasmine M. Omeke ’14, a first-time usher at the Church, said that she found both the sermon and service to be emotionally moving.
“It was beautiful—so incredibly beautiful. The sermon rang true for everybody in attendance, and I wish Reverend Walton the best of luck,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conversations turn to action with the student group Sustained Dialogue, part of an international organization that encourages discussions at 16 college campuses worldwide.
Harvard’s chapter of Sustained Dialogue was started in 2010 in response to Community Conversations, small group discussions held for freshmen during Opening Days that address themes of identity and diversity.
Since the Harvard network was founded, about four groups of 8 to 12 people have met each week to talk about their personal experiences and views on issues, such as identity, race, sexuality, and mental health.
In the past year, Sustained Dialogue has expanded its presence on campus by co-hosting events with many other organizations as well as implementing their own action projects, intended to turn conversations into concrete change.
LEADING THE DIALOGUE
The umbrella organization for Sustained Dialogue supports the Harvard campus network by training two moderators for each group.
The moderators are taught to guide their group, synthesize what has been talked about each week, and make sure that dialogue does not become combative.
“We go through great lengths to distinguish between debate, dialogue, and discussion. We push people to speak through their experiences,” said Ekene I. Agu ’13, one of the founding members of Harvard Sustained Dialogue.
The moderators are trained during Labor Day weekend for two days, eight hours a day. They learn to ask good questions, to encourage productive dialogue, and to teach their groups key phrases that will help them remember to let everyone speak.
“We have certain phrases. You don’t necessarily have to use them, but, for example, ‘Step up, step back’ is one of them,” said Ari M. Albanese ’15, a moderator.
‘Step up, step back’ means that people in the group should speak up, but should also be conscious if they are talking too much and should let others speak, Albanese said.
“It’s basically just a little phrase to help people remember to share the floor, but also participate,” Albanese said.
Because of their trained moderators, many campus organizations have reached out to Sustained Dialogue to help them moderate conversations between different student organizations.
During Harvard’s second annual Sex Week, Sustained Dialogue co-moderated an event about the relationship between race, culture, and expectations of sexual behavior with Sexual Health and Education Advocacy throughout Harvard College.
A FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH
While the groups have talked about everything from racial clustering on campus to students’ socioeconomic statuses, the topic of mental health has become central in a number of dialogues.
“A huge thing that comes up every semester is mental health—people feeling very isolated on campus and feeling a lot of pressure and being unable to identify where the pressure is coming from,” Agu said.
Agu said at Harvard students feel pressure not to show stress or weakness and instead to maintain a busy schedule like many others do.
“[Mental health is] tied to so many things,” said Judy Park ’14, a co-director and moderator. “It gets down to what Harvard culture is.”
Gabriella R. Malatesta ’13, the publicity co-chair for the organization, compared the atmosphere at Harvard to the Stanford duck syndrome, which compares Stanford students to a duck that looks calm on the surface of the water, but underneath is frantically paddling to stay afloat.
“There can be an atmosphere here in which everyone is saying ‘I’m fine’ and everyone’s really busy and we’re all kind of stressed, but, if you do express that to other people, do you feel awkward doing it?” Malatesta said.
She said that that dialogue comes up often in her group and noted that this type of dialogue is how Harvard’s social atmosphere can be changed.
“Every single day, you learn something personal about the people in your group,” Malatesta said. “It’s great that the change builds out of that.”
INSTIGATING CHANGE
After a couple months of dialogue, each group hopes to plan and implement an action project to put in place before the end of the semester. The action project is meant to address some issue that has come up in the course of dialogue and initiate change.
Last spring, one group did a “Destereotype Me Day,” in which they wore shirts that said a stereotype on the front and a statement that challenged that stereotype on the back.
For example, one participant wore a shirt that said “I am a legacy” on the front and “I am on financial aid” on the back.
Another group last semester organized a mini project during finals week. They hosted a study break and had students write anonymous words of encouragement on note cards. The cards were then placed in a box in Mather dining hall with a sign that read “Stressed? Take one.”
While this semester’s groups have yet not begun talking about what they plan on doing for their action project, Herman K. Bhupal ’16, a first year participant said she would like to see her group do a project relating to identity and first interactions.
“People assume so much about someone when they meet someone, but they don’t really get to know them,” Bhupal said.
Bhupal envisions a project that would deconstruct the image of meeting someone by asking them non-standard questions.
“Instead of asking ‘Oh, where are you from?’—anything that would dig deeper into that, getting people to connect right off the bat as opposed to a verbal factsheet,” Bhupal said.
Albanese said that regardless of the projects, the dialogue that the organization provides creates an important space on campus for these types of conversations.
“Talking, even if you don’t get an action project, is really important and healthy,” Albanese said. “I wish there was more of an emphasis put on that in this community.”

Students from across the Boston area gathered at Harvard Law School to pool their ideas for improving education through startup companies as part of the 3 Day Startup: Entrepreneurship In Education conference this weekend.
The conference, organized by Law School student Michael A. McMillin, ran from Friday through Sunday and attracted students from across the University who, by the end of the conference, came up with ideas for their own education-themed startups.
3 Day Startup is a nonprofit founded four years ago that runs events and conferences globally. This is the first time the organization has hosted a conference at Harvard.
McMillin said that entrepreneurship at Harvard currently suffers from what he called the “silo problem,” where students from different schools often do not interact.
“The problem is that business students talk to business students, undergrads talk to undergrads, law students talk to law students. We want to get people talking across all different disciplines and come up with new, interesting ideas,” McMillin said.
During the conference, students were split into groups, within which they collaborated in order to generate an idea for a start-up. On Sunday evening they pitched their ideas to a panel of experienced entrepreneurs, who served as mentors throughout the conference and offered feedback on their proposals.
McMillin said that while three days is too short a time to expect fully-fledged startups to emerge, he hopes the event encouraged attendees to think more about the entrepreneurial benefits of collaboration across the University.
“Some of these ideas probably will go on to become startups and real companies, but many of them won’t,” he said. “The real point is to come here and meet people and start something, so they have that experience. The prize is communication.”
Law School student Nicholas P. Whitney, who said he wants to pursue entrepreneurial law, said that he saw the weekend as a way to better understand the process of brainstorming ideas.
“It’s just about the experience for me, really,” he said. “If I get a concrete idea, well, that’s just a bonus.”

Staying active and maintaining an average body weight can lead to a 7.2-year gain in life expectancy, according to a study released by researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital last week.
The study, conducted in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, surveyed 650,000 individuals of all ethnicities and body mass indexes, aged 21 – 90. Results show that gains in life expectancy are much greater for those who begin regular physical activity earlier in life.
“Those active at a young age also tend to be more active as they grow older, so it is good to start being active at a young age,” wrote Harvard Medical School professor and senior author of the study I-Min Lee in an email.
Despite the busy schedules of college students that can make it difficult to follow an exercise regiment, exercise is crucial even at this early age, according to Meir Stampfer, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“People have a tendency to only think of years added on when they’re 89 years and older. But for a young person, the benefit of physical activity might be preserved vitality,” he said.
Finding opportunities to exercise can be difficult in an increasingly sedentary society, according to the study. The report examined “brisk walking,” an accessible alternative for those intimidated by intense fitness regiments.
Lee’s work shows that someone who walks 150 minutes per week, the amount of exercise recommended by the federal government, will add 3.4 years to someone’s life expectancy. A lesser workout of 75 minutes per week would add 1.8 years.
“I think people neglect the benefits gained from brisk walking. It seems daunting for people [but it’s] just a matter of prioritizing,” said Stampfer.
One of Stampfer’s studies also explores the benefits of exercise for people with varying states of health. This study involved monitoring physical activity in prostate cancer patients.
“Exercise prevents illness, but is also beneficial during illness,” Stampfer said. “In the prostate cancer patients who exercised, there was a decreased death rate compared to those who did not.”
In Lee’s study, the results were consistent for those with higher weights.
“Many individuals in the US are overweight or obese. For such persons, it is often difficult to reduce weight,” wrote Lee in an email. “What is encouraging is that our study shows that by being physically active, even overweight/obese persons can increase their life expectancy compared to someone their weight who is not active.”

At an Institute of Politics Forum in 2006, General David H. Petraeus met Paula D. Broadwell for the first time. This encounter would later develop into the relationship that caused him to resign as Central Intelligence Agency Director on Friday.
Petraeus admitted to having an extramarital affair in a statement after submitting a letter of resignation to President Barack Obama.
Broadwell, who cowrote a biography of Petraeus entitled “All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,” became close to Petraeus while he led coalition forces as a four-star general in Afghanistan. Petraeus previously led coalition forces in Iraq and oversaw military operations throughout the Middle East as Commander of United States Central Command.
Broadwell mentions Petreaus’s 2006 visit to Harvard in the first sentence of the biography and recalls attending a dinner with the General and other students.
Broadwell, who, like Petraeus, attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, writes that Petreaus gave her his card, and she followed up with an email.
“I later discovered that he was famous for this type of mentoring and networking, especially with aspiring soldier-scholars,” Broadwell writes in the biography. “He immediately responded to the e-mail, inviting me to bounce ideas off him. I took full advantage of his open-door policy to seek insight and share perspectives.”
Broadwell’s work on the book followed her 2008 graduation from the Kennedy School with a Masters in Public Administration. Currently, she is listed as a research affiliate of the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership and a PhD candidate in the Department of War Studies at King’s College in London.
Broadwell spoke about her book at an Institute of Politics event in September.
Broadwell did not respond to a request for comment, and her website, paulabroadwell.com, was taken offline Friday.
In a letter to colleagues at the CIA on Friday, Petraeus cited “personal reasons” for his resignation and said that he had used “extremely poor judgement” after being married for 37 years.
“Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,” Petraeus wrote.
Obama, along with other national leaders, reflected on the career of someone that they described as an important military leader and public servant.
“By any measure, through his lifetime of service David Petraeus has made our country safer and stronger,” Obama said in a statement. “Going forward, my thoughts and prayers are with Dave and Holly Petraeus.”
According to both NBC News and Politico, Broadwell is now under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for trying to access Petraeus’s personal emails.

Hundreds of high schoolers flooded the Science Center Saturday to compete in the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament­—a prestigious competition that attracts students from across the country.
Harvard and MIT undergraduates were responsible for both planning and running the competition.
HMMT coordinators, along with close to 100 volunteers, wrote the problems, proctored and scored the tournament, and hosted the majority of competitors in their dorm rooms over the weekend, according to tournament co-director Paul E. Handorff ’14.
During the tournament, 90 teams of six high school students each spent Saturday morning puzzling through written sets of math questions as individuals and as teams. The competition ended with a final, fast-paced “guts round,” where teams received progressively harder sets of three questions, intended to test their mathematic skills as well as their problem solving efficiency.
Handorff described the final round, which uses a scoreboard to provide instant feedback to competitors, as the most exciting part of the event.
“[Students] know each time they turn a set of three [questions] in how many of them they got right and how they’re doing in relation to all the other teams,” said Handorff. “It’s easily the most fun part of the tournament for organizers as well as for students.”
A team hailing from Western Massachusetts won the competition, sweeping the individual and group question sections, as well as the guts round.
Aaron Landesman ’16, one of two head graders who like Handorff competed in HMMT as a high schooler, said the event allowed him to spend time with students from MIT. The organizers, he said, were about evenly split between undergraduates from each school.
He said the high schoolers appreciated the opportunity to visit Harvard’s campus and meet students from the both colleges.
HMMT, founded in 1998, occurs twice a year—once in February and once in November.
The February tournament, which is more challenging and attracts a larger and global audience, will be held at MIT.

The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday night to support the adoption of a College-wide affirmative consent policy, just one week before students are set to cast ballots on the very same issue.
The UC’s Sexual Assault Policies and Procedures Act calls on Harvard to adopt affirmative consent in order to “lessen ambiguity” and bring the University’s policies in line with those of its seven Ivy League peers.Affirmative consent—in which partners must affirmatively communicate their willingness to participate in sexual activity—is also at the center of this fall’s student-led sexual assault referendum.
Representatives passed the position paper following a lively debate over the merits of preempting a student referendum. Proponents argued that the Council should show its support for the student-led movement, while opponents decried the idea that the UC would adopt a position on an issue that students will ultimately decide.
“The referendum shows that we should be taking some sort of action,” said James B. Pollack ’14, one of the act’s sponsors.
Representative Antone Martinho III ’13 voiced his opposition to the act’s timing—though not necessarily its content—multiple times during the debate.
“We are about to receive the votes of the student body on this very issue, and it seems utterly against the very idea of the proposition for us to take a position before students do,” he said.
If students ultimately decide to reject affirmative consent at the ballot box, the UC will have to change its official position, said Rules Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15 in response to a procedural question. Student-led referendums are binding if at least twenty-five percent of students vote in the election.
UC Presidential candidate Spenser R. Goodman ’14 cast one of the eight “nay” votes, while his opponents Akshay M. Sharma ’14, Tara Raghuveer ’14, and Michael C. George ’14 supported the act.
“I personally support this amendment,” explained Goodman. “However, I absolutely want students to decide on this. I don’t want the Council to influence them.”
At Sunday’s meeting the UC also announced the launch of “We The Crimson,” an online portal in which students can create petitions on student life issues and “like” them in order to receive an official response from the administration.
“Dean Hammonds will directly respond to the top three petitions each month,” said UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13. “And even for petitions not in the top three, I think it’s really important for the UC to see what students care about.”
The UC also passed a seventh round of fall grants packages by unanimous consent and moved to renew Thanksgiving bus service between Harvard and Boston Logan Airport.

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—Penn (5-4, 5-1 Ivy) gaining 22 yards rushing on the first two plays of the game and scoring a few snaps later on a 32-yard strike from Quakers quarterback Billy Ragone was an indication that the Harvard defense was not its usual dominant self in one of the most important games of the year.
Coming in with the top-ranked rushing defense in the FCS, the stout Crimson defense had previously allowed fewer than 44 rushing yards per game. But with the title on the line, Harvard (7-2, 4-2 Ivy) failed to find an effective way to counter the double-headed rushing attack of Ragone and running back Lyle Marsh that ran around, through, and over the Crimson’s front four, tallying 95 and 130 yards, respectively, on the day.
“Unlike a lot of teams that had played [Harvard] already, we lined up in a lot of two-tight-end sets, having a fullback on the field, having a lot of power, and really just running at them,” Marsh said. “We knew going in that we were going to focus on running downhill and not get away from that, even if we were struggling with it at times.”
Both quarterback and running back burned Harvard multiple times on lengthy scampers down the field, with Marsh finding holes and breaking tackles to record a 47-yard pickup in a drive that would culminate in Penn’s second touchdown.
“They did a good job blocking our guys,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You can talk about schemes, you can talk about strategy, but they did a good job blocking our guys at the point of attack, and they made the most of it fairly consistently during the game to keep their drives alive, to keep us off balance.”
With the Quakers’ running game keeping the front four honest, Harvard was unable to generate the pass rush that was averaging an FCS-leading five sacks per game coming into Saturday. Ragone wasn’t sacked a single time Saturday in the Crimson’s first sackless performance of the year.
The Penn offensive line gave the Quaker signal caller ample time to throw for two scores and 108 yards. Even after a hard hit dislocated Ragone’s ankle on the last play of the third quarter, backup quarterback Andrew Holland took over and completed a touchdown strike of his own to tight end Mitchell King just three plays later to extend Penn’s lead to 28-14.
UNDER PRESSURE
With sophomore right tackle Will Whitman already out for the season due to injury, the last thing senior quarterback Colton Chapple needed was for another experienced offensive lineman nto go down with an injury.
But midway through the second quarter, senior center Jack Holuba limped off the field and did not return to the game, as he emerged after halftime on crutches and a cast on his right leg.
The effects of the injured offensive front were felt heavily by Chapple, who was under pressure all day and was sacked six times, more than the line had allowed this season. When Chapple didn’t go down, he was often flushed out of the pocket or forced out of rhythm by the rush. The senior finished the game with one of his worst statistical performances of the year, throwing for 174 yards and a season-high two interceptions.
On a crucial third and 18, down a score with under two minutes to go and with the Crimson backed up to its own three, the pocket collapsed around Chapple, as it had several times earlier in the game. The quarterback scrambled around the end zone, trying to escape the swarming Quakers defensive line before finally being brought down by Brandon Copeland for a safety, sealing the victory for Penn. It was Penn’s third-straight sack on the three-play drive.
“The defensive line had a great game today,” Copeland said.
THIRD TIME NOT THE CHARM
Penn bested Harvard in many facets of Saturday’s game, and third-down conversions were no exception. The Crimson failed to gain a single first down on six drives and only converted four of 13 third downs, while the Quakers effectively moved the chains on half of their own third downs.
In the final quarter, Harvard went two-for-five on third-down conversions and had three three-and-outs, leading to excellent field position for Penn, which averaged a starting position of its own 40.
Although the Quakers were unable to expand their lead after King’s acrobatic grab in the first minute of the fourth, the edge in field position allowed Penn to pin the Crimson near its own end zone for much of the fourth quarter, leading to the decisive safety.

While most Harvard students are locked in Lamont for reading period on Dec. 7, the Harvard men’s basketball team will travel to Storrs, Conn. to face the University of Connecticut.
The last outing for the two teams saw the then-No. 25 Crimson, playing its first game as a ranked team, lose to the Huskies, 67-53. Connecticut used an aggressive defense to stifle Harvard in the paint in the low-scoring affair. Huskies guard Jeremy Lamb led the night in scoring with 18 points. Center Andre Drummond tallied 12 points on 6-for-7 shooting that included an explosive five dunks. The Crimson was propelled by then-junior Kyle Casey’s 12 points and was able to come in at the half just trailing by two points, 30-28. The second half of the game saw Connecticut go on a 17-3 run to seal their victory.
The Juskies went on to go 20-14 overall and 8-10 in the Big East. The reigning national champions fell, 64-77, in the second round of the NCAA Tournament to Iowa State.
With Lamb and Drummond now pursuing NBA careers, legendary head coach Jim Calhoun now retired and the team in academic hot water and already banned from postseason play, this season may be a rebuilding one for Connecticut.
Kevin Ollie has stepped into Calhoun’s shoes as head coach, and the program recruited 6’5” guard Omar Calhoun as well as two forwards, Phillip Nolan and Leon Tolksdorf. Calhoun, who hails from Brooklyn, played for the New York Gauchos—the same AAU team which Kemba Walker was once a part of—and will be a scoring threat.
The Huskies backcourt is dominated by the duo of veteran guard sophomore Ryan Boatright and junior Shabazz Napier. Napier and Boatright were the second and fourth highest scorers per game last season, with 13 and 10.4 points per game each, respectively.
Forwards DeAndre Daniels, Niels Giffey and Tyler Olander will round out the starting five. At 6’8”, 6’7”, and 6’9”, respectively, the trio may challenge the Crimson in the post.

Radcliffe crew closed out its fall season on its home river Saturday with strong finishes by veterans and a win from the novices at the Foot of the Charles Regatta.
On the tail of top Black and White novice showings at the Green Monster last weekend, the freshman heavyweights remained unbeaten. The 2.5-mile race marked the second outing for the lightweights, who competed alongside top heavyweight crews from around the Northeast.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
A total of seven Radcliffe heavyweight boats entered the three events and all but one finished in the top half of their respective races.
The novice eight won its third race of the season to finish the fall season with an undefeated record. The squad breezed by its competition with a time of 13:41, the fastest single time posted in the entire regatta.
The Black and White eclipsed the field by a considerable margin, finishing more than 20 seconds ahead of the next fastest boat. The Boston College squad finished in 14:04, while the boat from Boston University trailed in third with a time of 14:10.
“It was a really great race,” said freshman bow seat Genevieve Mulligan. “It felt really set and powerful. We walked away from the boat that was in front of us, which was good. [Our piece] felt really powerful the whole way.”
The novice eight boat has had a dominant fall. The crew was victorious at Head of the Housatonic last month and at the Green Monster on Nov. 3, winning each of its races by at least 14 seconds.
The four Radcliffe entrants in the varsity four race were composed of the top 16 rowers from across the program.
Syracuse bested the competition with a win in 13:50, topping the fastest Radcliffe boat by eight seconds. The Black and White B boat placed second with a time of 13:58 while the A boat followed in third place with a time of 14:10.
Syracuse and Radcliffe B were the only fours to break the 14-minute mark. The Black and White C and D entries placed eighth and 18th, respectively, in the field of 42 boats. Just over one minute separated the fastest and slowest Radcliffe squads.
The final event of the day, the third varsity eight race, featured another quick finish from the Black and White.
First to start, the A boat outpaced its competition initially, but fell to the crew from Rhode Island, which surged mid race and finished first. The Rams posted a time of 13:57, two seconds ahead of Radcliffe’s 13:59. The Black and White B boat finished 11th, with a time of 14:54.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweight crews raced against heavyweights, as the weight classes are not separated at the Foot of the Charles.
“Yesterday was a really fantastic day for the fours,” said co-captain Veronique Irwin, who did not race. “For all three of our fours to finish in the top 20 of a race of over 40 [boats] that are predominately heavyweights is great.”
In the varsity fours, Radcliffe placed in 12th, 15th, and 20th overall but had the top three times among lightweight squads. The Black and White A boat finished in 14:33, with the B and C boats coming in at 14:47 and 15:02, respectively. The next fastest lightweight boat was MIT’s A boat, which trailed behind with a time of 15:14.
“We had a really big range of fours: one that was mostly freshmen, one that was mostly sophomores, and one that was a mix of juniors and seniors,” Irwin said. “It was really cool to see the whole range do so well. It’s awesome to see the depth of our team.”
In the novice eight, the lightweights came in 11th overall and were second in their weight class behind the BU crew. The Terriers clocked in at 15:11, followed by the Black and White at 15:44.
Radcliffe was first among lightweights and sixth overall in the third varsity eight race with a time of 14:20, putting it ahead of Buffalo and MIT.
“It’s been our best fall season in a really long time,” Irwin said. “It’s all about just working hard through the winter.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, Harvard women’s swimming and diving proved it was the league’s best, as it emerged victorious against all of its Ivy competitors to take home the championship.
This weekend in Ithaca, N.Y., the Crimson (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) kicked off its season as though it had never left the pool. Harvard picked up its ninth-straight league victory with a decisive win over Cornell (0-2, 0-2) and Dartmouth (1-1, 1-1), marking the seventh consecutive year that Harvard has begun its competitive season with victories from the two teams.
“It’s a really fun meet to start off the year because it’s a tri-meet, and it’s exciting to see the competition battling with two teams at the same time,” junior co-captain Sara Li said. “It’s a really great meet for us to come in… and just practice our racing strategies and racing techniques because we’ve been working on them so hard day in and day out.”
In the Big Red’s home pool, the Crimson took home 11 of the 16 events, besting Cornell, 186-109, and the Big Green, 196-99, in the tri-meet, shattering eight of the Teagle Hall Pool records and breaking one of its own school records.
“I actually walked into the pool at Cornell and I noticed that we only had one Harvard name on the board from the last time we swam there,” co-captain Brittany Powell said. “I was like, ‘There’s no way that that board isn’t going to change this weekend,’ so [our swimmers] definitely proved it.”
The newest members of swimming and diving had an impressive showing in their first collegiate meet breaking pool marks in three events and contributing to a team record.
“The freshmen have been a really strong presence on our team from the beginning of the year,” Li said. “They’re not afraid to step up and have some fast swimming. Our team is meshing together really well already, so it’s exciting to see how far we can go together.”
Freshman Kendall Crawford showed off her talent as she broke both the Harvard and pool record in the 100-yard backstroke in 55.04. Crawford finished more than two seconds ahead of any other competitor.
“Our own records, especially, are very coveted,” Powell said. “One of the seniors that graduated last year, Megan Leddy, held the record before Kendall broke it yesterday, and that was shocking for me, at least. To see her go that fast at the beginning of the season was really exciting for what’s to come for her in terms of championships and possibly NCAAs.”
Another newcomer, Danielle Lee, swam the 200-yard backstroke in a record-breaking time of 1:58.61, while freshman Sherry Liu bested her classmate Marlee Ehrlich by nine seconds in the 1000-yard freestyle to take the pool record in 10:09.40.
Sophomores also dominated breaking another three records by out-touching their freshman teammates in each race.
Ana Anaya won the 200-yard butterfly in 2:01.97, while Kelsey Hojan-Clark paced the 500-yard freestyle in 4:58.54. Courtney Otto took home the victory in the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:51.70.
Otto, along with Li, freshman Connie Hsu, and junior Deirdre Clute, also surpassed a team mark in the 400-yard freestyle relay, tying with Dartmouth in a dramatic finish, as Li set a 100-meter record for the pool in her first leg.
“We were behind in the last 100, and Courtney Otto caught up to the girl from Dartmouth and they tied exactly,” Powell said. “That was really exciting.”
Sophomore Stephanie Ferrell and senior Mackenzie Luick also won their events in the 200-yard breaststroke and 100-yard breastroke, respectively, while the team of Crawford, Luick, Anaya, and Lee edged a fellow Crimson team to win the 200-yard medley relay.
The divers also had a successful day despite a changed format, as Powell and sophomore Amanda Largent went one-two in the one-meter diving contest after senior Teagan Lehrmann and Powell took second and fourth in 3-meter diving.
“The diving was all first instead of being in the middle of the meet, which is the usual format, so the diving started at 9 a.m. but we still did well,” Powell said. “The first event was a slow start, but in the second event, we pretty much dominated, so we were already out to a lead after diving.”
But even with the early success and the championship last year, Li says that this year’s team can’t rest on its laurels.
“We’re really looking at this season as a blank slate,” Li said. “We have this new motto that is ‘building a bridge’—taking all of the good things from last year and discarding the bad things and using that as momentum to fuel us forward but not to try to repeat what we did last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing just one starter from the 2011-12 squad, a deep Harvard women’s basketball team entered 2012-13 with questions surrounding who would become this team’s leaders and contributors. Through two games a host of answers have emerged.
In an 81-72 loss to North Dakota State on Friday, four Crimson players scored in double figures. Two days later, five contributed at least 10 points in a 65-52 win over North Dakota.
“I’ve never played on a team that’s so deep and that has so many scoring threats,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “I think that’s a huge strength of our team coming into this year, just the fact that we have so many scoring options.”
HARVARD 65, NORTH DAKOTA 52
The Crimson jumped out to a 6-0 lead and never looked back on Sunday, topping North Dakota at the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center in Grand Forks, N.D.
Last year, it was UND that gained a quick lead and held on for a 60-57 victory, but this time around, North Dakota was held scoreless for the first three minutes and entered halftime with just 19 points. On the day, UND shot just 33 percent from the field.
“What Emma and I talked about in the locker room…was that it was all about defense [on Sunday],” co-captain Miriam Rutzen said. “And I think that defensive mentality allowed us to get easy buckets on the other end.”
Most of those easy buckets were distributed among four scorers that combined for 59 of the Crimson’s 65 points. Junior Christine Clark led the team with 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting during a team-high 37 minutes of play.
Senior Victoria Lippert only made three of her 10 shots but tallied 14 points by going seven-for-eight from the free-throw line. Lippert also added eight rebounds.
In just her second college game, sophomore Temi Fagbenle had a double-double, finishing the day with 14 points and 10 rebounds thanks to a seven-point, six-rebound second half.
While those three starters had strong performances, the most efficient double-digit scorer came off the bench. Golen, who started last year, went four for four from three to score 12 points.
“I was feeling pretty confident in my shot,” Golen said. “It helps a lot that our bigs, Temi and Miriam, and [junior] Elise [Gordon] are getting in there, having a huge post presence, and drawing double teams—triple teams even—and that left me wide open.”
Two of Golen’s threes came within 30 seconds of each other six minutes into the second half to turn a 40-32 lead into a 14-point edge.
UND wouldn’t cut the deficit to eight or lower for the remainder of the contest.
“In terms of winning [on Sunday], it’s huge,” Rutzen said. “0-2 doesn’t feel good. It doesn’t sit well. Knowing we didn’t play well Friday and just lost by nine and didn’t play that well [Sunday] and still won by [13], that just shows how much potential we have, and I’m very excited about that.”
NORTH DAKOTA STATE 81, HARVARD 72
Harvard cut North Dakota State’s lead to one point three times in the final 15 minutes of Friday’s game at Bison Sports Arena in Fargo, N.D., but could never gain a lead of its own, eventually losing to the Bison by nine.
“We just weren’t able to stay consistent and get the defensive stops that we needed,” Golen said. “We had some feel-good, quick, easy shots that gave us a lot of momentum, but then we weren’t able to make a stop, and they were able to get the momentum going back in their way.”
Several Crimson comeback attempts during the game were foiled by Harvard’s 23 turnovers.
“I think there were a lot of first-game nerves,” Golen said. “The first half was very, very sloppy.”
NDSU tallied 30 points off Crimson mistakes, while Harvard netted just 12 points on the Bison’s 12 turnovers.
“It was a combo of first game jitters and a lot of new people coming into the rotation,” Rutzen said of the turnovers.
Despite the errors, Harvard found itself in the game with six minutes left, after Lippert hit a three to cut the home team’s lead to six. But over the next four minutes, the Crimson went zero for three from the field and committed a turnover as the Bison extended their lead to 11.
NDSU sealed the win by going 10 for 12 from the free-throw line in the game’s final two minutes.
“What’s really exciting is fact that we only lost by nine and that was a really bad game in terms of playing with each other,” Rutzen said. “We definitely improved [on Sunday.]”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All season, the Harvard women’s cross country team has stressed the importance of peaking at the right time. And on Friday, with a trip to the NCAA Championships on the line, the Crimson women delivered.
Following its best Ivy League finish in three years, Harvard continued its success, finishing in fourth place out of 37 teams at the Northeast NCAA Regionals. Though the team narrowly missed out on earning one of the two automatic qualifying bids to the NCAA Championships next weekend, it was informed on Friday night that it was given an at-large bid to attend the meet for its first time since 1983.
“We were all sitting together holding hands in anticipation,” junior Emily Reese said. “As soon as they announced that we were going [to the NCAA Championships], everyone jumped up, screaming. We ran two victory laps around the indoor track…. It was excitement like I can’t even describe.”
At regionals, the Harvard women employed a strategy that has allowed the team to steadily improve all season long. The Crimson’s pack of five scoring runners were separated by only 38 seconds at the meet, paced by Reese who finished in 19th place with a time of 20:27.
“[We] really put everything out there,” Reese said. “I, the coaches, and the rest of the women couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.”
Sophomore Viviana Hanley was hot on Reese’s heels, finishing in 20th place, covering the 6k course in 20:36. The race was an improvement for the sophomore, who was Harvard’s fourth runner at the Heptagonal Championships.
Junior Morgan Kelly and senior Samantha Silva were also scorers for the Crimson, earning 27th and 36th places, respectively. Both runners have been Harvard’s top finisher earlier this season, with Silva’s strongest showing of the year coming at Heps. Sophomore Alaina Alvarez rounded out the Crimson’s scoring with a 48th-place finish.
Going into the race, Harvard runners said their strategy was to identify runners from teams that had a chance of qualifying for nationals and finish in front of them. According to Reese, Boston College and Providence were among these squads.
But after five runners had finished, there was nothing to separate Harvard from BC in the team standings. The Crimson found itself tied for fourth place with its local rival, with each team tallying 150 points. In order to break the tie, race officials went to dual-meet scoring, comparing Harvard’s first runner with BC’s first, then both teams’ second runner, and so on until the fifth finisher from each team.
Though Reese and Hanley were bested by the Eagles’ first two runners, Kelly, Silva, and Alvarez all finished ahead of their respective opponents, giving the Crimson the tiebreak. BC also received an at-large bid to the national championship meet next weekend.
“[BC’s] one-two punch is one of the best in the region, without a doubt,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “But I really feel like it was the depth of our women’s team that is what helped us prevail…. We eked it out, but at the end of the day, we’ll be at the national championships, and that’s what people will remember.”
The Harvard women will be joined by a pair of runners from the men’s squad, who picked up individual bids to the national championship meet in Louisville, Ky. Juniors Maksim Korolev and James Leakos proved that they could be frontrunners beyond the Ivy League, finishing in 2nd and 5th places, respectively.
“I’ve felt for a long time that [Korolev and Leakos] were capable of this level of performance,” Saretsky said. “They were real cool and calm under the pressure and did an outstanding job throughout the race of not panicking and…allowing the race to develop to finish as high as they did.”
Facing a 10k course for the first time this season, Korolev ran a blistering time of 30:16, which equates to 4:52 per mile for 6.2 miles.
Leakos was not far behind his classmate, crossing the finish line in 30:27, also averaging faster than five minutes per mile. The duo’s top-five finishes came in a field of 239 runners from 34 schools.
Freshmen Dan Milechman and Tom Purnell, along with senior Jakob Lindaas, rounded out the top five for the Harvard men. As a team, the Crimson tallied 163 points for sixth place, Harvard’s best finish since 2006. Iona took home the men’s team title, and Ancient Eight runner-up Columbia finished in second.
On the women’s side, two of the Northeast region’s perennial powers, Providence and Connecticut, took home the top two team spots, and Cornell—the 2012 Ivy League champions—earned third place.
“[Qualifying for nationals is] the crowning achievement in our sport,” Saretsky said. “It’s tremendous for our program…. It reinforces that Harvard cross country can be among the best in the nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team opened its season in dominant fashion at Cornell on Saturday, racing past both Dartmouth and the Big Red by a score of 207-93.
The Crimson (1-0, 1-0 Ivy) includes 29 returning swimmers and eight All-Ivy competitors. The team swept its first eight events to claim its 41st consecutive win over the Big Green (1-1, 1-1) and fifth over Cornell (0-2, 0-2).
“We came out with a lot of energy and maintained really good attitude throughout the meet,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We were a little tired going in because we had a tough week of training, but I think the guys responded really well.”
The day began with the diving events, in which sophomore Mike Mosca—the 2012 Ivy League Champion on the one-meter—took the one-meter and three-meter events by 55 and 27 points, respectively. Over the summer, Mosca and his partner placed sixth in the three-meter synchronized diving competition at Olympic trials.
Harvard’s freshman swimmers impressed. Three rookies won races for the Crimson, which took 11 of 14 races with Dartmouth picking up the remaining three.
“The entire freshman class stepped up today and showed us what they were about,” Roop said. “Pretty much across the board, they were fantastic. It was a great meet for them, and we were really happy to see them perform so well.”
The Class of 2016 includes four All-Americans and five swimmers who competed at Olympic trials this summer alongside eight other Harvard veterans. The recruits, ranked No. 6 in the nation by CollegeSwimming.com coming into the season, lived up to expectations.
Christian Carbone won the 200 fly with a time of 1:50.58 and placed third in the 200 breaststroke. Jacob Luna won the 100 fly in 50.63 and Christian Yeager and Ty Rocca went one-two in the 200 back, where Yeager won in 1:52.37.
The freshmen also contributed in their first collegiate relays. In the first race of the day, Luna joined junior Jack Pretto, sophomore Chuck Katis, and junior Chris Satterthwaite to take the 200 medley relay with a time of 1:32.82. The Crimson’s B team took fourth in the relay.
Harvard repeated in the second relay, with the A team winning in 3:05.96 and the B team coming in fourth.
According to Roop, the team focused on the mental aspects of racing coming into the meet.
“We have been working on our racing mentality all year,” Roop said. “It doesn’t really matter how you feel or what the circumstances are, what matters is racing as best as you can with what you have.”
Harvard’s focus paid off, as three upperclassmen each picked up a pair of victories. In addition to Mosca’s wins in the diving events, Satterthwaite swept the 100 and 200 frees with times of 46.05 and 1:41.46, and sophomore Mike Gaudani tallied wins in the 500 free and the 1000 free with times of 4:35.62 and 9:24.94, respectively.
Also picking up individual wins for the Crimson were Pretto in the 100 back, which he swam in 51.12, and Katis in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 55.30.
The Crimson athletes said they were confident going into the matchup given its historical dominance of both teams, but Harvard coach Tim Murphy emphasized the importance of the performance in addition to the result.
“When we were coming into the meet, the coach pulled us aside to talk about how we did last year,” Carbone said. “Dartmouth beat us swim-wise, but the divers pulled through, and we ended up winning the meet anyways. This meet we were really looking on going all out every single race.”
Dartmouth junior Zupan Nejc won the 200 IM and 200 back, and the Big Green gained its third and final victory in the 50-yard free, when senior Zack Doherty beat out Cornell senior Chris Meyers by .17. Second place was the closest the Big Red would come all day, as the team was shut out of both the swimming and the diving events and lost to both Harvard and Dartmouth. Cornell divers Phillip Truong and Jon Zollo went two-three in the three-meter dive.
In the past four years, the Crimson has one perfect conference record and three 6-1 finishes. The team is looking to repeat its success this year and believes that it has the talent.
“We feel like we have made great strides so far this season,” Roop said. “We have some tough meets ahead of us, but we are ready to rise to the occasion. I think we are in a good position to have a chance at the Ivy League championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first tournament of the season, the No. 23 Harvard wrestling team took on competition from throughout the Northeast on Sunday at the Binghamton Open in Binghamton, N.Y. The Crimson’s day was highlighted by a second-place finish from freshman Jimmy Ott, while co-captain Steven Keith and junior Cameron Croy finished fifth in their respective weight classes.
Although Harvard did not experience as much overall success as it did in last season’s trip to Binghamton, when five Crimson wrestlers earned top-four finishes, the tournament provided the team with a chance to get back on the mat against regional competition.
“The first tournament is always exciting, but we realize that we have a long season, and we want to gauge where we’re at,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We had some ups and downs today, so I wasn’t too pleased with the overall performance. But I know that we’re going to get a lot better.”
In his first collegiate wrestling tournament, Ott did not fail to impress en route to his second-place finish. Wrestling at 125 pounds, Ott dominated his first tournament matches, securing four victories to only a single defeat.
Ott took his opening match by securing a fall at 4:35 and followed up the performance with a 16-0 shutout of Princeton freshman Max Rogers.
Ott went on to achieve two more victories, one by a second fall, to propel him into the finals.
Ott was ahead for most of the match and was seconds away from ending his first tournament with a title, but Cornell freshman Nahshon Garrett took advantage of a mishap to steal the match from Ott in the final seconds.
“[Ott] is a super kid, he trains hard, [and] he’s just a go-getter,” Weiss said. “He doesn’t really give anybody too much respect, which is awesome. He wrestled tremendously today…. But he’s a better wrestler because he lost than if he would have won. That mistake he made won’t creep up on him again.”
After achieving a third-place finish last year at Binghamton and placing eighth in the NCAA Championships, Keith wrestled in five matches and ended in fifth place this year at 141 pounds.
Keith won his first three matches on Sunday, decisively taking down opponents from Finger Lakes Wrestling Club and Penn State before winning a narrow, 6-5 struggle against Penn sophomore Charles Cobb.
But Keith was knocked out of the top bracket when he suffered a fall in the semifinals, and his tournament ended when he was pinned again in the following match.
Co-captain Walter Peppelman, who sits seventh in Harvard history with 92 wins and, along with Keith, was an All-American last year, came out strong in his first two matches, winning the first, 16-0, and achieving a fall in the second at 1:23.
But Peppelman’s tournament ended on a sour note with two close losses.
“[Keith and Peppelman’s] goals are to win national championships,” Weiss said. “They just had tough days, quite honestly…. They’re already at [the top] level, so now it’s just making adjustments. We’re hoping to see them in the finals, so to not see them [there] was hard. But they’ll use [the early losses] to their advantage.”
After taking advantage of an opponent forfeiting due to injury, Croy secured a tight, 3-2 victory against a Sacred Heart opponent before falling to Ivy League rival Craig Scott from Cornell.
But Croy went on to capture a series of wins in the wrestlebacks to earn fifth place at 184 pounds. Croy and sophomore teammate Josh Popple, who advanced through the lower draw with a series of convincing wins, eventually faced off in the lower bracket with Croy coming out on top, 5-2.
“It was a great tournament to open up the year,” Croy said. “I think we have a lot of work to do, and this tournament helps show us where work needs to be done. But I saw some good performances today out of some of my teammates that I’m really excited about, and I think we’re going to have a great year.”
The No. 23 ranking is Harvard’s highest entering a season under Weiss. In addition to Keith and Peppelman, sophomore James Fox also boasts a national ranking of 20 for his weight class but did not wrestle on Sunday.
“Right now we have a few guys hurt, and those guys will really end up contributing to our lineup,” Croy said. “We’re going to have a great year this year. We have good guys in every weight class, from top to bottom.
“And we’ve got some depth this year, too,” Croy continued.
“We’ve got multiple guys going deep into the tournament, so it’s promising for us.”

The Harvard women’s tennis team dominated its own tournament—the Harvard Fall Invitational—this weekend, with six individuals and two doubles pairs reaching the finals. The tournament was divided into five different single and two doubles flights, and the Crimson took home titles in five of those brackets.
Harvard competed against players from Boston University, Boston College, and New Jersey Institute of Technology on the courts at the Murr Center.
“I was really proud of the way our team competed this weekend; it was a nice way to wrap up the fall season,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Everyone was working hard in practice, and it really showed out there in the matches this weekend.”
On the singles side, co-captain Hideko Tachibana, co-captain Kristin Norton, and freshman Amanda Lin took home titles for the Crimson. Tachibana won the blue flight after topping Harvard freshman Hai-Li Kong, 6-1, 6-1, while Lin defeated Madison Craft of BU in the finals of the orange flight. Norton won in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, against Crimson sophomore Sylvia Li to capture the green flight.
Green said she was impressed with Li’s play, despite the sophomore’s loss in the finals of her bracket.
“Sylvia Li has been playing very well—she has been playing well all semester,” Green said. “Hopefully she can keep the momentum going for the spring season.”
In addition, freshman Chrystal Yen made a finals apperance, though she ultimately fell to BU’s Kim McCallum, 7-6(5), 6-3, in the yellow flight.
In the lone final devoid of a Crimson face, Katya Vasilyev of Boston College won the red flight with a win over Vivian Laszloffy of the Terriers. Vasilyev took the first set, 7-5, and Laszloffy retired before the start of the second set.
In doubles, Norton and He defeated Kuzmenko and Macdonald from NJIT, 8-2, in the finals of the crimson flight. Norton and He come into the season ranked No. 37 in the country in doubles, second best in the Ivy League behind Penn’s duo of Julianna Rodin and Agustina Sol Eskenazi.
Lin and Li won a marathon match against Vasilyvev and Kelleher from Boston College, winning in a tiebreaker, 9-8(1), to capture the Harvard flight.
“Doubles-wise, I was really impressed by the development of Li and Lin,” Green said. “They showed their tenacity on the courts winning the hard-fought match against Boston College.“
The Harvard Invitational brought an end to the Crimson’s five-tournament fall season.
According to Tachibana, the freshmen’s success this weekend was an affirmation of their growth throughout the fall season. A trio of rookies came away with a total of one title and two second-place finishes.
“They don’t seem like freshmen any more,” Tachibana said.
As they enter the offseason, Crimson players and coaches alike emphasized preparation for a tough spring schedule.
The Crimson went 11-7 overall last season, with a 4-3 mark in Ivy League, finishing tied for third with Columbia.
“Right now I think [the offseason] is all about maintenance,” Tachibana said. “It’s a matter of making sure we stay in shape and making sure we keep our skills sharp.”

In its final tournament of the fall season, the Harvard men’s tennis team competed at the Tribe Invitational held at William and Mary over the weekend.
On Friday, the team went 8-3, taking three of the four doubles matches against its Tribe opponents. The Crimson fared worse on Saturday, going 2-6, but won eight of the nine singles matches on Sunday.
Playing the top line for Harvard, sophomore Denis Nguyen lost a close decision to Notre Dame’s Greg Andrews—the No. 24 ranked player in the country—on Saturday, 2-6, 7-6, 11-9. The result came on the heels of a Friday loss against William and Mary’s Jamie Whiteford—who is ranked 43rd—7-6, 6-3. Sophomore Henry Steer was able to pull out the lone three-set victory for the Crimson on Saturday with a 2-6, 7-6(7-4), 17-15 triumph over the Tribe’s Aaron Chaffee.
“I think that the progress has been good throughout the fall,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “The goal is to continue to build so that you are playing your best tennis by Ivies. I think that everyone has something that they can take away from this weekend and say that they are improving on. As a coach, that’s all you can ask for.”
After winning the A draw in the season’s penultimate tournament—the Harvard Halloween Classic—freshman Kelvin Lam and Nguyen fell, 8-4, in the first round on Friday. Harvard, which won both doubles draws at the previous tournament, suffered four losses in doubles on Saturday, but won three of the four matches played on Sunday.
In the spring, the team switches from competing as individuals to having its results counted as a team, playing dual matches instead of tournaments. Steer said that the dual match atmosphere is much different than that of the fall tournaments.
“There is a lot more energy in the spring matches,” Steer said. “It’s more of a real team atmosphere because everything we’ve been working for is riding on every match, and you have guys who aren’t playing really cheering…from the sidelines. It adds an energy to the match when the guys on either side of you are really affecting you, which isn’t like how it is in the fall.”
With two months between the Tribe Invitational and the first competition of the spring—the Jan. 18-20 Harvard Winter Invite, where Boston College, Marist, and Fordham will visit Cambridge—the Crimson has its only long break of the season.
“This is a perfect time to work on our fitness and run a lot more,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “We can work on playing more points amongst each other and in the gym, running, and lifting so that we can get as fit as we possibly can. Another short-term goal is growing mentally tougher as a team so that we are always fighting and letting the other guy know that we are never going to back down.”
As the only senior on a team that features 12 underclassmen on its 14-man roster Nguyen has the most collegiate tennis experience. He said that he tries to use what he has learned to shape a positive team dynamic.
“I want to instill a mentality in the guys early on so that they know what to expect come the spring,” Nguyen said. “What it takes to win a college match is a lot different than what it takes to win a junior tennis match. It’s all about instilling a certain mentality and trying to portray that on the court myself so that they can copy that.”
Nguyen said he hopes that the team can improve upon its second-round finish in the NCAA tournament from last year, but that Harvard is focused on the future and not the past.
“We’re trying to start fresh,” Nguyen said. “I know that we did do well last year, but we don’t want that lingering on us. We are starting completely new and working with this mentality that we have something to fight for. We haven’t done anything yet this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Penn senior quarterback Billy Ragone imagined regaining the Ivy League crown, he couldn’t have foreseen it looking like this. But, puffing a victory cigar on his makeshift throne of a Kobata 4x4 injury cart, he looked plenty satisfied.
Late in the third quarter, Ragone was leading his Quakers on yet another long drive, moving the ball from the Penn 13 to inside Harvard’s 30 on just seven plays. On the eighth, he escaped the pocket again, knifing his way through the Crimson defense before being tackled by senior Nnamdi Obukwelu. But when Obukwelu got up, Ragone stayed down.
It soon became clear that Penn’s quarterback would not be coming back into the game Saturday. But the Quakers were prepared. They had dealt with adversity before.
Just three short weeks ago, the team was 2-4 coming off a two-touchdown loss to Yale—the Bulldogs’ only Ivy win thus far. That week, the squad’s seniors, who already had two Ivy rings, had a meeting and set their minds to turning their final season around.
“It seemed like all hope was lost for our team,” Penn senior Brandon Copeland said. “[Senior Jeff Jack] said we had won championships and we had been undefeated in the league…but it would be that much sweeter to be the senior class of the team that turned it around midseason and sit here today, happy.”
Since that meeting, Penn has run off three straight wins against the teams currently ranked second, third, and fourth in the league standings. In all three games, the Quakers broke second-half ties and held onto a lead.
They did it even without Ragone on Saturday, scoring three plays after the QB went out to open up a 28-14 lead. Harvard responded with a touchdown of its own on the next drive but got no closer than that.
Ragone re-emerged on the sideline with just over four minutes left in the game—perched on the same buggy that had carted him off, but this time with a large cast encasing his left ankle—to watch Penn close the deal with a late safety and three kneel-downs.
After that final play, the team busted out cigars to celebrate at least a share of its third championship in four years. The sight of the immobile quarterback reclining on the sports utility vehicle, smoke rising from his mouth as he shook hands with teammates, coaches, opponents, and even a few fans who had stormed the field and did a television interview from the comfort of the bed was a perfect image to sum up the oddity of this Ivy season.
Four weeks ago, Harvard sat atop the Ancient Eight having beaten Brown and Cornell by an average score of 45-22. What happened at Princeton in the Crimson’s next league matchup remains a mystery, but regardless of whether Harvard took its foot off the gas or the Tigers just mustered an historic comeback, Princeton came out of that week controlling its destiny after a 39-34 upset. But that didn’t last long.
Two consecutive Tigers losses over the next two weeks sent the reigns of Ivy power back to Cambridge. After a 69-0 drubbing of Columbia, it seemed that Harvard was going to take advantage of the do-over Princeton had given the team. But in the de facto Ivy League championship game that the Crimson’s annual matchup with Penn has seemingly become, the reigning champ didn’t seem to bring its A-game.
On the Quaker’s penultimate possession, Harvard was given one last chance to regain control when backup quarterback Andrew Holland fumbled in Crimson territory. But no Harvard players bounced on the ball, and Penn eventually recovered.
That has been the story of this season. A dominant Crimson squad was given a few chances to right its season down the stretch, but it didn’t capitalize on enough of them. On the other hand, the Quakers took advantage of every opportunity they had, winning every close Ivy game they played in.
In doing so, Penn, a familiar face at the top of the Ancient Eight, has emerged from an abnormal season. But all of this comes with a grain of salt: Harvard may get one final chance.
By knocking Ragone out for the season, the Crimson dealt a major blow to the Quakers’ chances of winning the league outright by beating Cornell next week in Ithaca, N.Y. Though the Big Red is only 2-4 in Ivy competition, it has already upset Princeton and will looking to spoil Penn’s coronation on Senior Day.
Cornell will have the advantage if it can turn the game into a shootout—the Big Red averages the most passing yards per game in the Ivy League by nearly 100 yards per contest while the Quakers will have to rely on Holland.
If Cornell can pull of the upset and Harvard can handle Yale at home, the Crimson would win a share of the Ivy title. It’s not what the preseason Ivy favorites had in mind at the outset of this year, but at this point, the team will take it.

Move aside Adams and Quincy! It looks like Hillel now has dining restrictions as well.
Harvard University Dining Services posted a sign outside the Hillel building this weekend asking students to eat there only if they are a member or invited guest of the Jewish community. Over the weekend, a hand-made sign saying that Hillel does not support the views of HUDS was affixed next to the sign, but has since been taken down.
The move comes after HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin told The Crimson that Muslim students who eat Halal food can and should go to Hillel to get their fill.

In anticipation of The Game this Saturday, The Boston Globe published a story pitting Cambridge against New Haven. Sadly, there are several comparisons that the Globe got wrong. Out of nine categories, four went to Yale (and one was a tie.) Here is the real truth about which college city is better:
Souvenir: According to The Globe, visitors to New Haven can walk away with better souvenirs than those who visit Cambridge. Seriously? Tell that to the thousands of tourists crowded in the Yard and dozens of t-shirt shops scattered around the Square.
Hamburger: Yale came out victorious in the question of which city could offer a better hamburger. Mr. Bartley's went head to head with Louis' Lunch in New Haven. Clearly the Globe staffers have never had "The Jeremy Linsanity," a pizza burger with marinara sauce, mozzarella, and french fries.
Art Museums: Although renovations continue to drag on at the Fogg Museum, there can still be no question that the museums in Cambridge are of far superior quality to New Haven's. After all, the Fogg can't have spent three years of renovating on nothing.
Best Dinosaurs Without Tenure: The Globe gave Yale the edge in the battle of the science museums as the Harvard Museum of Natural History went up against Yale's Peabody. Not only does the 42-foot long Kronosaurus swimming through Harvard's museum look awesome, it's also the most complete skeleton of that species ever found. Oh, and there's this.
Football: The article left out the most important comparison of all: football. History shows Harvard is the clear victor, but we'll just have to see come The Game.
If you're curious which categories Harvard did win, here they are: "Lying Statue," "Famous Music Club," "Sports Bar," and "Dinner on Mom and Dad."

With just one day to go before voting opens in the Undergraduate Council's Presidential election, the UC Election Commission has a message to campaigns: don't hang your campaign posters under other posters and don't campaign outside Annenberg!
In an e-mail to the UC general list, the Election Commission declared campaigning outside Annenberg to be "disruptive of the student/freshman dining experience."
In response to that e-mail, one representative questioned whether a rule actually existed that prohibits campaigns from standing outside the dining hall.
"In general, Campaigning is prohibited in any location where it would cause a general nuisance," replied the Commission.
Representatives and others on the UC e-mail list were not satisfied with the Commission's response.
"What does that even mean? Where on earth could you possibly campaign without causing the public some sort of general nuisance?" wrote one member.
The official response from the Election Commission was terse, informing UC members that rules are created and enforced "at EC discretion." In a follow-up e-mail, the Commission added, "If you have questions about campaign activity, ask before doing them, not after."
In yet another e-mail, the Commission clarified its stance on campaign posters. According to the Commission, a poster may be placed near another campaign poster. However, it may not, under any circumstance, be placed underneath another campaign poster because "it gives the impression that the other candidate postered over your poster."
Violations of this rule have resulted in the Commission issuing multiple fines to campaigns. Violations limit campaigns in their ability to spend as each ticket is prohibited from exceeding a $400 spending cap.
Below are the campaign violations from this year's race, in the order they've been released:
George - Granath: $10 (poster and/or e-mail violation)
Raghuveer - Zhu: $20 (poster and/or e-mail violation)
Sharma - Sharma: $40 (poster and/or e-mail violation)
Sharma-Sharma : $5 (poster violation)
George-Granath: $30 (poster violation)
Raghuveer-Zhu: $10 (poster violation)
George-Granath:  $30 (poster and campaign finance violation)
Goodman-McLeod: $25 (poster and campaign finance violation)
Sharma-Sharma: $25 (poster and campaign finance violation)
Raghuveer-Zhu: $20 (poster and campaign finance violation)
Violation Totals:
George-Granath: $70
Goodman-McLeod: $25
Raghuveer-Zhu: $50
Sharma-Sharma: $70
