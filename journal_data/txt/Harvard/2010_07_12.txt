After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NY—Critics of Harvard complain that it offers little in the way of practical education, that its students emerge better equipped to debate the merits of Kant’s categorical imperative or Joyce’s Ulysses than to navigate the real world.  This summer I decided that I would supplement my humanities-laden coursework with something more functional.  I decided that, at age nineteen, I would finally learn to drive.
My roommate, who hails from Nebraska, does not cease to remind me that she has been driving since the age of ten (I do not cease to remind her that that’s easy for her to say, having grown up in a state with more cows than people).  I remind her that I am from New York City, where the majority of families do not own a car.  But even I have started to feel that my inability to drive is a source of embarrassment.
So, the week after I returned home from school, I waited on line for three hours at the Department of Motor Vehicles together with a motley assortment of adolescents and new immigrants.  I successfully completed a multiple choice exam–7 questions out of the 14 required to pass were about drunk driving–and received a slip of paper, my temporary permit.  This timeless American coming-of-age ritual would probably signify a whole lot more if I were a sophomore in high school rather than a sophomore in college.
A few days later, Ron–the driving instructor who my mother’s friend’s daughter’s boyfriend swears is terrific–arrived at my apartment building for our first lesson.  Even he seemed surprised that I had never before sat behind the wheel of a motor vehicle.
And so I began my journey learning to drive in a city that even experienced drivers avoid.
Crawling through the streets of Manhattan at 5 miles per hour with a neon “Student Driver” sign, I seem to attract the city’s finest–cab drivers who honk and curse when they have the misfortune of getting stuck behind me, bicyclists who try to cut me off, and tourists who laugh at the audacity of someone learning to drive in the New York pandemonium.  And of course there are the pedestrians who see me coming toward an intersection and decide to sprint across the street, knowing full well that, at the speed I’m driving, they’ll probably be halfway down the next block before I arrive.
After four lessons, things have gotten easier.  I can drive around the block like a champ.  I’ve even hit 25 miles per hour, which, in rush hour traffic, isn’t half bad.  Some of my classmates might be saving the world this summer, but I’m conquering Manhattan–one left turn at a time.

TANGA, Tanzania—Dr. Abbas was late for our appointment because he was called to attend his friend’s sister’s funeral. When he finally arrives he makes his apologies, and as he pulls off his long white over-robe he directs us four Harvard students to sit on the examining table in his office. We are to be questioning the doctor on the management and procedures of his health clinic, in order to write a quality-improvement report, but the discussion is broken up every few minutes as he sees various patients. While most doctors block off time to talk to us, Dr. Abbas makes us part of the circus of his clinic.
He sees his patients at his desk. They sit on a stool next to him, and the appointment is part examination, part interview. Six-year-old Jamal comes in with his father because he has been having sore throats. Jamal wears a long-sleeved striped shirt with a yellow skull and the words “Tiny Terror” on it, but today Jamal looks like the terrorized one. His father sits on the stool, and Jamal stands between his legs, emerging only to have his heartbeat listened to. As Dr. Abbas explains to the father that Jamal has to have his uvula—a small fleshy extension located in the back of the throat—cut, the little boy’s eyes get wider and wider. Then the doctor takes Jamal’s chin, moves close so his white beard almost touches the boy’s face and looks over his glasses directly at Jamal, “you’re not going to cry are you?” Jamal stares, shocked, and then abruptly shakes his head. “Good, good,” Dr. Abbas pats Jamal’s bald head and gives him a toffee from a box on his desk.
In the end, our report excoriates Dr. Abbas’s clinic. Besides having a toffee box, the doctor’s desk also contains a messy array of loose antibiotics, piles of money, and insurance receipts. He keeps medical records only for his long-term patients, and even those are largely written on loose papers stuck in a notebook. After I accidentally drop the notebook, I spend frantic minutes collecting all the sheets that fell out, terrified that if I miss one I will lose all trace of a year of a sick patient’s illness. His attending nurse wore flip-flops during a minor operation and talked on her cell phone while conducting a pregnancy test.
But I still feel there is something valuable in the care that Dr. Abbas provides. Just as he compelled a small boy to be brave for a scary operation, Dr. Abbas looks to give all his patients more than simply a medical cure; he aims to provide them with the strength to face their small hurts on their own. He treats them as compassionately and interestedly as one would treat family, and though by reasonable medical standards this is terrible practice, in an area where just the idea of being sick seems ominous, this makes his patient care most appreciated.

CAMBRIDGE, MA—On behalf of Harvard Habitat for Humanity, and probably most of the world, I’d like to take this opportunity to clear something up about charitable donations. No one wants your underwear. Not if it’s a crumpled up lacy thong, not if its neatly folded expensive briefs, and especially not if its shredded granny panties.
Of course, unlike these unsightly unmentionables, a lot of the stuff people donate to Habitat at the end of the year is really great. It’s by selling used futons and fridges and those secret storage containers disguised as ottomans that we make money to fund build trips in the U.S. and abroad. It’s amazing to see students’ generosity with their stuff, and hilarious to see what else they throw in.
We set up a “Shrine of the Bizarre” to display the weirdest stuff we found: a plastic torso, a statuette of a woman deflecting a greyhound from her groin, a plush horse head cut to fit’s over a person’s head.
One blue donation bin contained an upside-down cactus.
Then there’s the slightly more normal weird stuff. We get complete collections of homework, laminas of expos essays, bio problem sets, orgo midterms, and MCAT study books.
Others unload their snack stashes. Most of the food items are along the lines of ramen and oatmeal packets, but occasionally we get a batch of not so freshly baked muffins, or a carton of Chinese take-out.
Sometimes I run across something I also own. This usually makes me a little sad—especially if its something from a club or event—like I’m a sucker for holding onto the kind of things another person would toss.
Between the books, the spattered microwaves, the discarded photographs, it could all become a strange kind of anthropology. For every pair of designer jeans, there’s a truly hideous sweater.
Suddenly, sifting is like hearing a secret: everyone here is just as dorky as you!
Or, at least, the things they throw away are.

SANTIAGO, Chile—Silver-haired and clad in an expensive-looking suit, he looked to me like a dignified, grandfatherly figure. But this man was definitely not my grandfather; he was the president of the Pinochet Foundation—an organization dedicated to promoting the life and legacy of the notorious Chilean dictator—Hernán Guiloff Izikson.
This afternoon visit was meant to be just like the other activities on the orientation for summer program, but how could it be?
It is impossible to describe the feeling of listening to someone praise a man who was responsible for the torture and death of thousands of Chilean citizens during his brutal 17-year regime. I tried to keep in mind the purpose of our visit: earlier that day we took a tour around Villa Grimaldi, which was one of the chief torture and detention centers in Santiago, and now we were at the Pinochet Foundation to hear “another perspective.” But trying to see “both sides” wasn’t easy given the atrocities that took place in Chile between 1973 and 1990.
On Sept. 11, 1973, Pinochet helped lead a military coup that overthrew then President Salvador Allende’s democratically elected socialist government. Pinochet’s takeover heralded a period of brutal repression–Marxists, students, and suspected political dissidents were interrogated and tortured in government detention centers. Many of these individuals were “disappeared,” their bodies never found.
Everything about the foundation felt disingenuous in some way, from a book filled with glossy photos of a smiling Pinochet with grandmothers and little dogs that the institute gave us as a parting gift, to the foundation’s chartiable work; it offers scholarships for students who wish to go to university. We collectively cringed as a young woman—I think she was an intern—flitted about enthusiastically snapping photos of us sitting near a life-sized portrait of General Pinochet: I could just imagine the promotional caption, “Harvard students visit the former office of a great man of Chile!”
When the floor opened up for questions, Izikson neatly skirted inquiries about the gross violations of human rights perpetrated by Pinochet’s government. Against the threat of communism, he said, Pinochet did what was necessary to prevent the destabilization of the country and the outbreak of civil war. One of the few things he thought Pinochet could have done differently? “Well, I think it was a mistake not to return the bodies of the dead to their families,” he said.
A mistake indeed. The lack of physical corpses was what allowed international prosecutors to press charges against the dictator in his later years. Cases of torture and murder, which had been dismissed as “accidents” under Pinochet-era investigations, were declared still open to investigation because the victims’ bodies were never found.
I had to remind myself that most Chileans today would condemn the human rights violations that occurred under the Pinochet dictatorship, although some still praise him for implementing free market reforms that helped turn Chile into a modern, economically powerful Latin American country. The Pinochet Foundation undoubtedly sits at the most extreme end of the spectrum, but Izikson’s apologizing for the General’s “use of force” isn’t as far out as it might seem.
Most of us left the foundation feeling unsettled by the experience of hearing unspeakable violence discussed in coldly rational terms. It would have been useless to try to debate Izikson on any of the points he made, since he was clearly operating on a system of logic that was entirely incomprehensible to me, one that wrote off human rights violations as unpleasant but justifiable necessities—not as fundamentally repulsive acts.
In the spirit of intellectual inquiry at Harvard, we’re always encouraged to see complexity in everything, to explore multiple perspectives, to avoid looking at things as black and white. But to be perfectly honest, there’s nothing that will ever convince me that Augusto Pinochet Ugarte was anything but a monster.

BEIJING, China–In Asia, the current center of global economic growth, every consumer, organization and government faces difficult environmental choices on a daily basis. Chinese industry develops quickly throughout the country, leaving rising emissions in its wake, while the Japanese government fights against much of the rest of the world for its right to continue hunting threatened whales. In India, governments and courts debate the merits of developing industry at the risk of harming sacred and vital freshwater sources.
These are by no means easy decisions. Countries such as China and India, after being mired in poverty for centuries, are not enthusiastic to adjust their entire development plans for environmental objectives. Japan has a history of whaling and fishing that extends centuries. Yet when these countries make decisions harmful to the environment, they ignore some clear costs that have often not been discussed in policy debates. Through a variety of fundamental processes, healthy ecosystems provide “natural capital,” a public good that has a clear material value.
Healthy ecosystems provide measurable economic benefits, including supplying us with clean air and freshwater, protecting us from disease, and supporting global agriculture. These “ecosystem services” are not easily replaceable: water filtration or desalinization processes are unbelievably expensive, no one has yet found a way to manufacture clean air, and the genetic diversity provided by a variety of species and plants is a major bulwark for producing valuable medicines and preventing the spread of diseases.
Different ecosystems can all be valued according to the services they provide. Right here in the Beijing metropolitan area, not exactly an environmental hotspot, researchers valued the “stock value of forest natural capital” at 19.46 billion RMB (in 2007), and the value of its output, in providing services such as water conservation, air purification, and biodiversity conservation, at 61.77 billion RMB, or almost 7% of the region’s GDP. The current Chinese national accounts, however, only measure 0.20% of this figure in current GDP figures.
Many might wonder why we want to place a value on the abstract concept of “nature” or “biodiversity.” After all, some might view these as precious areas separate from the forces of capitalism. Others might wonder why trees and animals should get the same treatment as factories and workers in national accounts.
It is important to place a value on ecosystems and biodiversity because this is the only way to realize nature’s role as perhaps the world’s most important public good and make informed, accurate decisions on its care. By placing a value on the availability of clean water, it became clear to the Chinese government that it was worthwhile to pay farmers to plant less water-intensive plants, and subsidize residents not to kill exotic birds. In the 1990’s, the U.S. government used a similar method of analysis to decide to protect the forests of the Pacific Northwest and retrain and compensate the affected loggers.
In essence, valuing ecosystem services creates a market for the functions that nature provides for humanity. It is impossible to imagine Asia without its sacred rivers, vibrant oceans, teeming forests, and stunning landscapes, but the continent will soon face life without its natural treasures if it does not realize their true value.

CHICAGO, IL—I wish Chicago would love me back.
For four weeks now, my fellow interns and I have embarked on a whirlwind tour of beaches and piers, restaurants and cafes, architecture foundations and art museums – all recommended by our respective guides to Chicago. But it is now weekend number five and I am becoming indignant. Now, look, Chicago, I want to say to the city, I am doing all this despite my 80-hour-work week and a total lack of directional sense, so if this isn’t love, I don’t know what is. Why can’t you just show me something cool? And yet, the city remains unwilling to offer up its hidden neighborhoods that would yield summer travel stories to rival those of my blockmates, who are off in cities like Paris and Athens.
This weekend, however, my friend Kelly visits and insists that we take ourselves on a trip to Evanston. Kelly is the opposite of me. She buys no guidebooks but seems to instinctively know her way around the city. She explains to me that the coordinates at each L stop tells us how far we are from State (0 W/E) and Madison (0 N/S) and that we are heading away from both, to visit one of the largest art festivals in the Midwest.
There, we walk between the stalls selling paintings and pottery and jewelry too expensive for us to afford. While I check my phone for any missed calls from the office, Kelly absent-mindedly points out some color in a photograph she liked, or the way the sun glints off a brass ring. Her arrival brings a sense of nonchalance, a realization that for her, time means nothing and the mornings might as well creep into afternoons that fade into evenings. And for the first time this summer, I slow my pace. I realize, after a while, that I did not need to know what my guidebook said about the genre of these paintings or the architects of these buildings.
I simply absorb the sounds and sights of the day—the couple dressed in fiery yellow and green African fabrics, selling paintings that resemble those of Salvador Dali; the stall displaying photographs of white houses that slope up from a blue Grecian ocean; the tent filled with vases of different shapes, all painted the same turquoise and golden-brown. On a cross street, vendors sell Italian ice and Spanish coffee and bread warm from the summer sun.
Today, I am not planning what I ought to do with the few free hours of my weekend, or summer, or life. I think, instead, of other summer days.
I think of last summer, when Kelly and I were back in China, back in the land where we felt foreign and naïve and happy to accept the smallest things the country had to offer. That summer, we would often stop walking in the middle of a street simply to stare—at the food vendors in Shanghai, the gardens in Suzhou, the black-roofed, white-walled villages in Anhui.
And this summer day, I, too, stop in the middle of Evanston. I sit and feed myself spoonfuls of shrimp and feta and spinach in caper aioli sauce bought from some street-side cafe. The whole thing melts against the roof of my mouth and I let it sit, tasting its texture, listening to the voices of the crowd rise and fall.
It is then that Chicago opens itself to me. I think, then, that this is Chicago. It is the wind that threatens to pull artworks from their perches. It is the food – Mediterranean and Cuban and Italian, and all wonderful.  It is the hint of a brilliant blue lake that lurks inconspicuously beyond these streets filled with art.
The patch of sunlight shifts slowly from beneath me as the morning melts into afternoon and I give a quiet thanks to Kelly for reminding me what it is to be idle and blessed, and to Edna St. Vincent Millay for giving me the words of this day:
And all the loveliest things there be
 Come simply, so it seems to me.

RIVER EDGE, NJ – The last place anyone should be on a hot summer morning is on a bus. Or, for that matter, on any morning. Any summer day. Any time, ever.
When you grow up bridge and tunnel, working is easy, commuting is hard. In North Jersey, there are bus towns and there are train towns. Because, decades ago, some New Jersey Transit employee hovering over a map of Bergen County had a bone to pick with suburbia, mine is a bus town. (There are trains, certainly, but their arrivals are painfully infrequent, whereas buses fight their way down the main drag like mosquitoes.)
Depending on what time I wake up, there is my mother, my sister, or my father, or a bleary-eyed permutation of the three. I turn the dial on the kitchen radio to WCBS 880 on the 8’s, 1010 WINS on the 1’s.
If the traffic is light, I eat oatmeal and watch a few minutes of Frasier on Lifetime or The Sopranos on A&E, speculating aloud, to my cats, as to what season the episode might be from. If the traffic is bad, I lumber, half-asleep, to the corner in the hopes of catching the next bus. (I usually miss it.)
My buses deposit me into the bowels of either the Port Authority, at 42nd and 8th, or the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, at 175th and Broadway. To reach the latter, I enlist the service of a fleet of scheduleless jitneys—gnats to New Jersey Transit’s mosquitoes—that blast Spanish music, on which a stop is requested with a strident “La próxima.” (I should mention here that the irony of the $10 roundtrip bus ticket that takes me to and from my unpaid internships is not lost on me.)
Regardless of what bus I choose—or, more realistically, which bus chooses me—the rules of commuting are the same. You are entitled to switch seats if the otherwise nice-looking businessman next to you proves to have body odor so bad that it’s palpable. The right side of the escalator is for standing, the left side is for walking quickly, and if any lead-footed specimens should dare to violate this, you are entitled to sigh loudly on the step behind them. You are entitled to, for no good reason, be grumpy.

GOA, India—A week ago, I was eating masala dosa for breakfast in a little restaurant in Goa when commotion erupted outside.  The sound of men yelling and rocks hitting the glass of the restaurant windows broke through the usual restaurant buzz. A dozen police attempted to get control of the rock-throwers using bats and sticks, shoving them into the back of a police vehicle while journalists pushed to get a shot of the action with their cameras. A crowd of people had gathered around to watch.
The waiter who peered out the window alongside me just shrugged. “Would you like more chai?”
I found out later that the rock-throwers were members of Shiv Sena, a far-right political party in India that was one of over a dozen groups that organized a nationwide strike to protest rising fuel prices controlled by the Indian National Congress party. The strike—or bandh, the hindi word for “closed”–effectively managed to halt all economic activity in India for the day. Buses stop running, schools closed, flights were canceled, stores were shut. It looked like my long-weekend trip to Goa might last a bit longer than planned.
While the experience was alarming, it was also impressive. The organizational power of Indian political parties to act in the face of a perceived injustice is tremendous. A political objection to fuel prices cost the economy approximately a day’s worth of GDP. This scale of political involvement and coordinated mobilization is unthinkable in the United States.
In Panjim, the normally bustling capital of Goa, the streets were deserted. The popular Portuguese beach settlement on the coast of the Indian Ocean had become a ghost-town overnight. But the young Goan woman with whom I was staying believed she could find an open restaurant. We drove through the empty capital until we found a small breakfast place that appeared to be open. A line of police officers with machine guns guarded the entrance.
I was not aware that I was making a political statement (albeit minor) by eating in a restaurant that refused to close on Monday. I did not realize that my consumption of dosa and chai countered the opposition parties’ efforts to temporarily paralyze India’s economic engines. But these stalwart supporters of Shiv Sena certainly viewed restaurant patrons as adversaries, and decided that storming the restaurant might teach us non-compliers a lesson. The bandh, a theoretically peaceful tactic of civil disobedience, had turned violent on this street corner in protest of the Congress party and its leader Sonia Gandhi (who coincidentally shares the last name of the pioneer of peaceful civil disobedience. . .).
Yet the Goans I spoke to the morning of the bandh were unfazed. They met my awe, with a certain amount of annoyance. “Here we go again. . .” was the line of the day.
And sure enough, the restaurant episode was anticlimactic in the end. The attempt to storm the dosa joint was quickly thwarted. Nobody was hurt, the attackers were carted away quickly, the crowd outside dissipated within an hour. And eventually even I stopped gaping at the street where the police and protestors had collided, and returned to my breakfast.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—The schools are canceled this morning, parts of subway stations shackled closed. Every store from the large supermarket to the one-man kiosk is locked and dark, and not a single car has passed down this once-busy avenida in minutes.
If it weren’t for the roar of the crowd, the showers from confetti cannons, and the requisite “Goooooooal!” over the load speakers in the plaza a block away, Buenos Aires would appear a fancy ghost town, not a bustling metropolis. The World Cup, or Copa Mundial, has emptied the city—the whole nation watches unified in anticipation.
Late to the game, I pry into the back of a crowd of nearly 15,000 gathered in Plaza San Martín to try and see at least part of the JumboTron. Attendees standing on the grass may be packed shoulder-to-shoulder—and some even closer—but I manage to move through the swarm of people now absorbed by the silence of apprehension. Looking down to check the time, I notice that the outside of my hand is chalked in light blue and white, rubbed off from the face paint of the boy to my side as I struggled through the crowd.
Game after game, this served as my Mundial ritual. I stood amid a nation gripped and united. Impassioned discussions of Manager Diego Maradona’s offensive-heavy strategy and star forward Lionel Messi’s inability to make a single goal replaced aimless small talk while waiting for the subway. Meetings at work were cancelled or postponed upon learning that the nation was to advance to the next game. Flags covered balconies across the city and street vendors temporarily gave up on selling pirated DVDs or jewelry to instead peddle Messi jerseys, vuvuzelas, and blue and white mohawk wigs.
Despite these anecdotal observations of national spirit, I struggle as an American to comprehend the scale at which Argentines energize and bond around the Mundial. Only 45 percent of TVs in the US were tuned into this year’s most watched television event, the Super Bowl; over 70 percent of Argentine TVs tuned into the last Argentina Mundial match against Germany while hundreds of thousands (if not millions) watched the game in cafés and in public plazas, like me, where many cities setup giant screens.
But in the time it took the referee in the quarterfinals game to blow the final whistle and declare Germany the winner with a score of 0-4, the captivation and unity of a nation evaporated.
The crowd thinned as the score ticked up to 0-3 with just 16 minutes left. Soon after, the flags came down, the blue and white scarves suddenly turned unfashionable, and the small talk—accompanied by silence—returned to the subway platforms. The restaurants and bars were filled like any Saturday the night following the game, but the camaraderie from a shared Mundial between Argentines, regardless of class, political party, retirement status, or any other possible grouping, never seemed to return in full.

Citizens Bank in Harvard Square was the subject of a false bomb threat on Friday afternoon, according to the Cambridge Police Department. At 2:19 p.m., an anonymous female called the bank, informing bank staff that the establishment was going to explode.
Upon receiving word of the threat, police evacuated the building at 6 JFK Street, redirected traffic, and warned businesses in the surrounding area of the threat. A CPD bomb unit was sent in to search for possible explosives and declared the building safe at around 3:20 p.m.
According to  CPD spokesperson Dan Riviello, bomb threats like this are infrequent but are investigated as a necessary precaution. There are currently no leads on who made the threat.
