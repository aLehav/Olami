Harvard’s endowment has declined over 27 percent in the past year, and the billions of dollars lost in the credit crunch demands attention. Yet The Boston Globe and others who call for a fundamental change in Harvard’s investment philosophy as a result are themselves off the mark. Insisting upon conservative money management looks good now, but the benefit of hindsight will always change the evaluation of an investment. Smart management demands flexibility—this does not preclude conservative investment, but the willingness to take risks is a critical characteristic of successful money management. Such risk can, of course, generate significant return, as evidenced by the success of Harvard’s managers before the credit crunch. A bad episode (in this case historically bad) will naturally give pause but should not force Harvard to abandon more risky investments in the future if such investments are the smart choice. The entire Harvard community and even all of Greater Boston feel the loss when financial woes strike Harvard. This shared burden, however, cannot justify a policy of forced, unnecessary conservative investing. The community may suffer with Harvard’s losses, but it benefits from its gains as well. Struggles in Cambridge are also being felt nationwide—Harvard was not the only major employer and investor to suffer in this crisis. Higher risk investments often yield high returns and enlarge the endowment, and such gains will help the community emerge from the doldrums. If anything, this situation reinforces the folly of long-time demands by advocates such as Senator Charles E. Grassley, who until the crisis demanded higher spending from Harvard’s endowment. For many, Harvard was being too conservative even in the boom years; now it is more fashionable to criticize the university for its profligacy. The Allston project, with its new science complex, for example, was hailed as visionary—until the financial crisis put it on hold. Even the Boston Globe editorial admits the complex “will transform Allston” when it can be built. Such decisions are easy to call foolish after the fact, but they were sensibly made given the information at hand, and their objectives remain as laudable now as they were before. Critics can tell Harvard how it should invest and complain about its endowment loss, but Harvard’s investment practices are still fundamentally sound. Harvard should be allowed to look out for its own interests without backseat advisors—especially as such interests will ultimately benefit the greater community.

For better or worse, Harvard’s actions greatly affect the surrounding community. Its employment of thousands of individuals from communities throughout Massachusetts and the university’s projects in the loci of those areas ensure a high level of codependence. The recently stalled initiative to build the Allston science complex, coupled with layoffs of Harvard employees, provides us with explicit proof that Harvard’s decisions have a significant effect on people within the school’s sphere of influence, regardless of whether those people are willing residents of that sphere. Meanwhile, Harvard occupies a peculiar position as a nonprofit educational institution—it does not contribute back to the community through property taxes despite its profound influence over communities and their members’ livelihoods. Harvard’s level of influence on surrounding communities impels Harvard to adopt spending and investment habits that make initiatives like the construction of the Allston science complex less dependent on market conditions or investing climates. A more conservative approach to investing and spending would ensure that, no matter the state of boom or bust in the markets, key Harvard initiatives, whose progresses have an uncommonly significant effect on the community, will not be stalled in a manner that is unduly harmful to community residents. We can see the effects of poor financial planning simply by observing the pernicious effects of our stymied science-complex initiative, where plot vacancies and rodent infestations reveal the real implications of a stalled and invasive construction project. Arguments that the economic downturn affects Harvard just like any corporation or institution or that they were pressured to spend by self-interested individuals are unconvincing and do not exonerate Harvard of its responsibility to surrounding communities. Even though this financial crisis was very difficult to predict, a less risky investment approach and more conservative spending practices during prosperous times would have at least ensured that Harvard would not be the one adding to the considerable financial stress that community members already face in a downturn. This appeal to socially and financially responsible practices should not be interpreted as an indictment of Harvard’s efforts to improve the quality of education and generate high returns on investments. Rather, they should be taken as suggestions that we acknowledge our influence over our neighbors by adopting spending and investment practices that can be sustained even in weak markets. The fact that the larger community derives some benefits from successful Harvard financial policies does not absolve Harvard of its responsibility to provide insurance for itself and the community against the effects of stalled initiatives. Harvard’s interests are not incompatible with attempts to insulate the community from the effects of policies with no plan for a rainy day. Neighboring communities may receive some derivative benefit from Harvard’s prosperity because of their location, but they need not share in Harvard’s pain.

Critics, take note: Tightly crafted prose and lofty moral sentiments may have their place, but what really matters at the end of the day is the number of times a text mentions camels. “The first thing a falsifier, a tourist, an Arab nationalist would do is have a surfeit of camels, caravans of camels, on every page,” writes Jorge Luis Borges in his essay “The Argentine Writer and Tradition.” In what is perhaps the greatest (the only?) assault on the dromedary in prose, Borges goes on to deride the animal as an outrageously artificial exoticism, the employ of those lacking both imagination and a real understanding of their own culture. After all, the most authentically Arab work of all manages to do without: “In the Koran, there are no camels.”The illustrious Buenos Aires author was a little off: The Koran actually does allude to camels twice, in passages 6:144 and 22:36. But despite the humps in his logic, Borges’s argument still holds water. The unfortunate truth is that many books written by non-Western novelists in English—especially those by South Asian authors—rely on the equivalent of camels for effect, peppering works with spices and ceremonies, arranged marriages and zany in-laws: in short, deploying the stalest, most predictable tropes in the Orientalist handbook. Book reviewers stateside pat themselves on the back for compassing “world literature”; arts supplements splash their fronts with selections of the month like Anita Desai’s “Fasting, Feasting” or Aravind Adiga’s “The White Tiger.” Enthusiastic reception notwithstanding, however, the “local color” in which these books traffic reduces perceptions of the region to little more than cartoonish, “My Big Fat Greek Wedding”-esque stereotypes.Harsh? Perhaps. Yet the breach between the possibilities for “diaspora” fiction and the lackluster reality is disappointingly vast. To pull a book from the shelf at random, take Pakistani author Kamila Shamsie’s 2002 “Salt and Saffron.” “The stories that [narrator] Aliya tells are full of the aroma of pilafs and the mouth-melting softness of kebabs,” promises the back flap; Shamsie is said to write with “warmth and gusto.” And the book is indeed a pleasing read, chock-full of family legends and tales of love that transcend caste boundaries. But the overwhelming feeling upon turning the last page is that all this makes Pakistan seem rather like a fairy tale: and that all this has been said before.The tendency for South Asian authors to draw from the same well of themes again and again, worn out and misguided as they are, likely has more to do with over-ambition than laziness. Walk into nearly any major bookstore in Mumbai, and literature will be divided into two sections: “Fiction” and “South Asian Fiction,” meaning books of the Adiga-Desai stamp. (A strain of nationalism too is on display: Books by South Asian authors on non-South Asian topics, or non-South Asians on South Asia, find no place on the latter shelf.) A book that “matters” enough to merit national pride often connotes a thick tome of realism—one that attempts to cram between its two covers either all the dramas of family life or an entire sordid cityscape.In practice, this drive toward realism prompts writers to turn to a set of stock cultural representations closely linked to historical portrayal by the west. And the issue hasn’t just got tweed-suited postcolonial theorists gnawing at their pencils. In the fifth installment of his Charles Eliot Norton lectures this Monday, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Orhan Pamuk waxed troubled before a packed audience in Sanders Theatre. The American writer, he said, has the luxury of dabbling in regionalist vernacular (a hat tip to his beloved Faulkner); in contrast, the Turkish novelist is doomed to make a “museum” of his fiction, preserving his culture and displaying it to Europe by packing in as many observations as he can. Rather than being a thing of beauty, this edifice crumbles under the weight of its own desperate attempts at self-preservation and hand-waving bravado.Pamuk’s own work evades this unpleasant end, but it’s the lucky escaped convict from the ever tighter conventions in which “third-world” novelists imprison themselves. Although some writers like Rohinton Mistry and Vikram Chandra do tackle traditional issues with a sure hand, the “South Asian novel” in general is approaching the self-caricature of modern Bollywood. In the Indian movie industry, the vibrancy of each film taken independently loses luster when held up against the genre: It’s always the same old song and dance.Yet first-generation South Asian immigrants, often guilty of penning the most terrifically clichéd novels of all, are also the most powerfully placed to guide the way out. Many Indian writers working in English live in the States or visit often, and they usually have the political freedom and socioeconomic means to innovate. Classmates in Jhumpa Lahiri’s creative-writing workshop at Boston University envied her for never having to cast about for topics, her own Bengali heritage lending her exotic source material every week; they should have criticized her for taking the easy path in merely penning realist snapshots of the immigrant lifestyle. Magical realism, stream of consciousness, science fiction: The number of roads not taken by the South Asian novelist boggles. In the end, a few camels may not be such a bad thing—but only if they can teleport. Jessica A. Sequeira ’11, a Crimson associate editorial editor, is a social studies concentrator in Winthrop House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the debate over energy legislation heats up in the Senate in anticipation of the Copenhagen negotiations, legislators on both sides of the aisle are turning toward models of climate change and the economic impact of new legislation. Ignoring the climate models for the moment—while they are important, I have neither the space nor the expertise to comment substantively on them—a deeper look at the economic models shows that members of both camps use these tools to support dramatically different conclusions. This underlines the only fundamental truth of models: Their results are entirely dependent upon the assumptions made during their creation. This is problematic, since the assumptions behind economic models do not include accurate costs of inaction.
This miscalculation is not a function of the models themselves; rather, it is an illustration of a larger problem with the system of costs (prices) in our economic system. This is neither a new problem nor an issue that only concerns environmentalists. In fact, it is the basis for an entire branch of academia. The economics of public goods, and more accurately the environment, are devoted to examining how a system based on private property can accurately price damage to public property. Consider a basic environmental example: water pollution. Before the Clean Water Act, companies could dump pollutants into waterways—a practice most people would acknowledge as a negative impact—but because no one in particular owned the rivers, no one could force the companies to pay for the damage their pollution was causing. Thus, the goods that company sold were under-priced due to the “free” disposal of waste. The CWA attempted to correct this by forcing companies to internalize the costs of water pollution, and, where it is enforced, it has succeeded.
The problem of inaccuracy in pricing applies on a much larger scale. Obviously, climate change serves as the largest current example of this, as legislators and regulators attempt to attach a value to carbon released in the creation or use of products. Without some sort of cap-and-trade regime or carbon tax, there is no mechanism forcing companies or consumers to internalize the damages of the pollution released into the atmosphere, and thus prices remain artificially low. Opposition to climate-change legislation criticizes the proposed bills for causing increases in the costs of electricity and other goods. What they fail to see, or simply ignore, is that these increases are not a premium added to the price of a good so that an unknown entity will profit. Instead, increases re-value goods so that their prices accurately reflect the true costs of production.
For centuries our economic system, and in turn the system of pricing, has treated environmental goods as a zero on balance sheets. The labor, infrastructure, and materials involved in production all had a cost associated with them that was reflected in the final price of the good. By systematically ignoring damage to the environment, our economic system employs a terribly inefficient pricing system. While the cost of damaging nature may not be easily quantifiable, it is clearly not zero. Indeed, certain estimates recommend that we value services provided by the environment to the global economy at as much as $33 trillion.
Accurately reflecting these values in prices is not simply a question of making adjustments to balance sheets or introducing legislation like the CWA that would internalize the costs of carbon in goods—although that would be a good start. Changing the current system will require that consumers recognize that there is a cost to damaging the environment, a cost that they must pay through a higher price for certain goods or by accepting a severely degraded environment. Regulation alone cannot accomplish this revaluation of the environment. The scope of the inefficiency is simply too broad; from carbon emissions to mountain-top removal, hundreds of thousands of production steps involve environmentally damaging activities whose consequences are not priced into the final value of the good. In fact, these practices generally make goods cheaper by moving measurable costs—increased wages paid for the additional labor required by underground mining, for example—to the unmeasured realm of environmental damage.
True pricing reform entails a shift in our worldview. It requires that we look beyond price tags and see the life-cycle costs of the goods we purchase. The government cannot mandate this through climate-change policy or pollution controls—it requires that citizens educate themselves in order to become conscious of their purchases’ environmental impacts. Opponents of the climate-change bills are correct: This will lead to higher prices. But these are prices that we can pay now, or we can accept continued environmental destruction. Either way, they will be paid.

I can’t tell if I’m getting fatter or skinnier.
I just know that I am. The general bulk is somehow shifting. A shirt rides loose today; tomorrow my pants rip; on Thursday my head actually fits into a hat. So, what’s the deal, Neil? How’s the fat, Pat? What’s the explanatty, Fatty? I honestly don’t know.
And finding out isn’t as easy as just buying a scale. I already tried that this summer when I stole one from my parents’ house. See, scales only give you numbers, and numbers don’t describe what’s actually cooking in crap’s kitchen—especially since my numbers have stayed relatively consistent.
Just so it’s out in the open, I weigh 212 lbs,* and despite seasonal swelling and shriveling, I have maintained this weight for the past three years. There are two possible explanations for this: I could be atrophying muscles—literally driving them to suicide through boredom—and adding valuable fat pieces to my public collection. Or, by mechanical pathways far beyond my comprehension, I could actually be gaining muscle and shedding fat.
Traditionally I’ve assessed my relative “fitness” through a standardized scientific assessment performed each morning. I’ve copied the procedure below.
Lift shirt confidently above the nipular level, eye-hump mirror extensively; initiate “flexing dive-poke.” To perform the flexing dive-poke, while flexing the abs, dive through the surface fat with a carrot-stiff finger. If bedrock is hit before the finger gets engulfed: success. If not, it’s another day of justifying away the man boobs.
Despite my strict adherence to this morning ritual, recent results have been inconclusive, even with alternative methods.
In high school, I measured my fitness by the amount of sexual attention I received from girls. Unfortunately, Harvard’s ubiquitous case of SADD, Sexual Attention Deficit Disorder, has rendered this method useless. Even the standard “hold the girth, close the eyes, memorize the size of the protrusion” assessment technique has failed to deliver conclusive results. So I’m asking you—any thoughts?
Maybe some more info on my current weight would help. I consider myself, at least for this school, relatively thick. I have delusions about neither the truth of this fact nor how this truth developed. 7-11 provides free nacho cheese on hot dogs. I discovered this three years ago. Hundreds of hot dogs fit into a single year. So now you’re caught up, do you have an opinion?
My roommates certainly do—have always—and it doesn’t help that both of them are fit. Understand, nagging from my roommates is no uncommon occurrence—“at least change your clothes once a day; at least wash your hair once a month; at least clean the pudding off your ear,”—but nagging about my weight has become one of our principle interactions. Just this morning, my roommate recommended I stand near windows more often since I look thinner in natural light. As often, I’ll simply get the line, “Oh, don’t worry, it’s hard to tell you’re fat because you’re tall.” God, I’m tortured.
Then again, maybe I’m obsessing about the wrong thing. Perhaps what really disturbs me isn’t my ambiguous state of fat but rather that I care so much about it.
As campuses go, Harvard is decidedly un-fat, which means corpulent Cantabs carry an extra heavy burden. But why? What’s driving this phenomenon? As I see it, there are two distinct explanations for Harvard’s lack of jiggling back jam. The first might be obvious. Quite simply, A high percentage of Harvard students are caffeine-driven, jitter-prone, type-A neurotics. Case in point: the dining hall withholds calorie cards so Harvard students can’t starve themselves so efficiently. Unfortunately, the other motivating factor is not one that comes from within, but one, more sinisterly, that is imposed on students by their peers. I call this the “Neil Zacky Prejudice”.
In second grade, Neil Zacky and I were debating a call in a game of capture the flag. Neil contended I was “out;” I contended I was “in”. After considering my argument, Neil concluded, “If you’re so smart, how come you’re fat?” Needless to say, I was ruled “out.”
While most Harvard students convey Neil’s sentiments with greater subtlety and rhetorical flare, the prejudice nonetheless exists. Obesity on this campus is like a signal flare: one that indicates a lack of discipline, dependence on gastronomical soma, and at its most basic level, weakness.
The best and most reliable example of this pressure can be seen in the Freshman Summer Squeeze—when hosts of pudgy freshmen return sophomore year with chiseled jaws and hilarious folds of loose skin. I know. Because I did it, too.
Then I let myself go.
Then three years passed.
And here we are. Fretting about my breading.
So what to do? Well, I recently ordered a tank system that measures my body’s fat composition as a percentage of volume—they use it for packing beef—so personally, I’m good to go.
But Harvard’s problem persists. Here’s my solution: we all go to 7-11 (which, by the way, is my favorite restaurant in the Square) and get Bahama Mamas topped with gallons of healing cheese—my treat. The campus gets hooked; our fat hate drops off as our cholesterol levels rise.
Or we take the more realistic approach. We recognize the scourge of the Neil Zacky Prejuidce within ourselves, we think about how much I cried that day in second grade, and we realize that prejudices about weight, even when held unconsciously, are as morally objectionable as those held about race, gender, or creed. And then we fix it.
And along the way—heck—maybe we’ll eat the hot dogs anyway.

“You know,” I said, “I’m not even sure where we are supposed to go.”
Jess looked at me and shrugged. She was wearing a sequined jacket, and as she moved the light from street lamps sort of bounced off her shoulders. We were standing in that alley between Border Cafe and LF, the one that separates the Coop into two distinct countries—books, Harvard merchandise.
Then, Frances arrived, Blackberry in hand. “Ready?” I said. We were.
It was Thursday. It was nighttime. We were late for a concert.
We walked down the stairs into Veggie Planet, through the doorway and into Club Passim.
Club Passim—a subterranean music venue on 47 Palmer Street, in the heart of Harvard Square—books new and established folk and acoustic acts nightly (and by that I mean every night, seven days a week). It has been a musical institution for over 50 years, since its start as Club 47 in 1958. The venue secured a place in America’s cultural history as an epicenter of the folk movement in the 60s, hosting legends like Joan Baez, like Joni Mitchell, like Tom Rush, Judy Collins, Suzanne Vega, and Bob Dylan.
Club Passim rightly earns a mention in most Boston guidebooks. I looked. It appears in “Rough Guide to Boston,” “Fodor’s 2009 Boston,” “The Boston Globe Guide to Boston,” “Phantom Gourmet Guide to Boston’s Best Restaurants,” “Frommer’s Irreverent Guide to Boston,” and in “Signpost Guide New England.” It is also mentioned in “The Complete Idiot’s Travel Guide to Boston.” And I had never been before last week.
I am a Senior. I have lived in Harvard Square for almost four years. Even idiots knew about Club Passim. What’s worse than an idiot? A moron, maybe. I guess I was a moron.
At the door, I waved a print-out, a ticket confirmation. A man with silver hair, glasses, all in black, showed Jess, Frances, and me to our table. His name was Jim. By then the opening act had started and we stumbled through the dark, through aisles tightly packed with tables and chairs. We apologized for bumping the knees of strangers, for stepping on their feet.
“Sorry,” we said.
A group of middle-aged men and women had claimed our table. Jim intervened and we stood nearby and crossed our arms. Waitresses pushed past with trays of vegetarian pizza and pitchers of water.  The opening act—a man with a page-boy cap and a full beard—picked the strings of his guitar. He sang about Austin, Texas, about fairy tales, about a sun so hot it burned holes in your skin. We gave up on our table and Jim pointed to another. We sat and ordered beer. We felt out of place, in the way. We waited for the headliner to take the stage, a British singer-songwriter named Laura Marling.
I’m no expert, but I know Laura Marling is good. (I’ve been listening to folk, to folk-pop, since my mom sent me James Taylor’s self-titled CD in a camp care package when I was nine; I wanted something by Christina Aguilera, and complained bitterly).
Last year, Laura Marling released her debut album, “Alas I Cannot Swim,” to much critical acclaim. She was, in fact, nominated for the prestigious 2008 Barclaycard Mercury Prize, which honors recorded music by British and Irish artists. And she’s still just a teenager.
Laura Marling is, you know, cool—hot, indie. So I thought I’d find other Harvard kids at the concert. But they weren’t (and if you were there, I’m sorry, I didn’t see you). In Club Passim, I felt like an interloper, like I was somewhere I wasn’t meant to be. But then Laura Marling walked on stage, and I thought I might have found an ally.
She stood in front of the microphone, guitar in hand, pale and fragile-looking. She wore skinny jeans and a grey sweater, white-blonde hair piled high atop her head. She sang about breakdowns and breakups, about depression. Her voice was gentle, sometimes, and rough. She looked sad and nervous. Awkward. Between songs she talked—shyly—to the audience.
“Do any of you go to Harvard?” she asked. And the crowd laughed. Jess, Frances, and I looked at each other. I felt betrayed.
“Shhh,” I said.
And for a moment I pretended that I wasn’t just a Harvard student, I pretended that I lived in Boston and did things like go to Club Passim instead of finals clubs. That between the essays and midterms and endpapers, I took advantage of the destinations listed in Boston guidebooks. Because I forget sometimes, stuck in the so-called Harvard Bubble, that I am in the midst of so much more, so much history and culture.
I am making a list of things to do before I graduate, before I leave New England. Maybe I’ll do some of them.
I need to visit the Institute of Contemporary Art, to walk the Freedom Trail, to crack an oyster at the Union Oyster House. I am afraid I missed all the Red Sox play-off games.

The story behind everyone’s favorite procrastination tool is hitting the big screen. The evolution of Facebook is currently being converted into a movie entitled “The Social Network” to be released in 2010. Directed by David Fincher, the film hopes to build on Facebook’s cult following and is counting on the popularity of the social networking site among 16-25 year olds to increase its revenue.
Part of the cast list for the film was recently released by the production company and, much to the excitement of the majority of the female population of Harvard (and probably some males, too), Justin Timberlake will be playing Sean Parker, the seedy Napster-mastermind-cum-Facebook-President. Jesse Eisenberg, most recently seen in Zombieland, is slated to play Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield will star as Eduardo Saverin, and oil heir Armie Hammer will play both of the Winklevoss twins.
Some scenes will be shot on campus in an attempt to recreate Zuckerberg’s and Saverin’s Harvard days spent studying computer science, punching final clubs, and, oh, creating one of the most genius Web sites ever.
FM likes the cast list so far, but we have some better ideas:
Mark Zuckerberg should be played by a “section guy.” We think the eagerness to get ahead and screw everyone else over should translate well on the screen.
Justin Timberlake can keep his role as Sean Parker. Since we have low expectations for the film, we’ll need something nice to look at to stay awake for 90 minutes.
The Winklevoss Twins should be played by real-life dopplegangers Conner Griffith ’11 and Drew Alcorta ’11. They’re not related, but we saw Armand Hammer on Gossip Girl, and we think Conner and Drew could even play the Olsen twins better than Hammer could play anyone.
The infamously screwed-over Eduardo L. Saverin ’05 should play himself, since he never got his 15 minutes of fame the first time around.
According to IMDB, D-Lister Eamon Brooks is “rumored” to be signed on to play the mysterious “Bobby.” Sounds like a perfect role for the mysterious Barry S. Kane. As registrar, he probably has enough time to shoot a movie on the side.
Why waste money on a real actor to play “Pheonix Senior A”? Any of the actual Phoenix seniors would be happy to do it if it didn’t involve memorizing lines.

Hey Professor of Scandinavian and Folklore Stephen A. Mitchell...
Since Halloween is this weekend, do you know any creepy Harvard ghost stories?  During the first snowfall, a mysterious woman appears in the Yard, looking for the body of her fiancé who died in a sleigh accident. They were both riding on the sleigh one icy, wintry night when it suddenly tipped over and the young man broke his neck and died. He was buried in a crypt, but someone discovered days later that the body was missing from the crypt.
At the same time, the police had found a homeless man wearing the black coat that the young man was supposedly buried in. They put two and two together and figured that the homeless man had sold the body to the medical school (which was at Holden Chapel at that time) and kept the coat. During all this time, the young woman had been in seclusion. But when she learned of what happened she went to Holden Chapel to look for the remains of her fiancé.
However, all traces of the body were removed by then. So she went to Bedford and remained in seclusion. But during the first snowfall people see the ghost of this young woman walking through the Yard toward Holden Chapel in a long black mourning dress. There are never any footprints left where she treads, and it is said that she disappears as suddenly as she appears without leaving a trace.

Thayer Hall is well known for its central location, impressive common room, and...Victorian-era ghosts? Yes, Thayer, long rumored to be a host for paranormal visitors, claimed one of the coveted spots on Internet Web site Hollow Hills’ “Haunted New England Colleges” list.
Now the site of last minute cramming, illegal parties, and early morning wake-up calls (courtesy of its bells), Thayer, according to Hollow Hills, was once the home of a textile mill. For what we can only assume were the mill’s amazing health benefits or notable 401(k) plan, its employees haven’t seemed to want to quit for a few centuries now.
“A professor who chose to remain anonymous contacted me and said that he had seen Victorian figures going through areas in the hall where there used to be doors and there aren’t now,” says Fiona F. Broome, who composed the list. “He had a lot of credibility. Just in the way that he wrote, I felt confident that this man was not a crazy person.”
Despite Broome’s confidence, many campus experts have disregarded the legend, and there are no records of it in Harvard’s database.
“I have seen no evidence to that so far,” says Josh A. Bookin, a Thayer proctor who is admittedly not a strong believer in ghosts. “The most notable of the out of the ordinary activities are parties that need to be broken up.” Note to Thayerites: Bookin will not be accepting a fear of ghosts as an excuse to cuddle up with him in his room.
Whether or not the mill’s workers are still wandering through the halls, Broome suggests that they contain historic value. “I’m not going to do the whole, ‘Dude, run!’ thing. I don’t get scared of ghosts. I’m interested in the stories that ghosts can provide about history.”
So, instead of staying up for hours reading over your coursepack and memorizing countless dates, try hanging around the mill’s old doorways. You might just catch a glimpse of an ancient worker in authentic Victorian garb. If, on the other hand, you find yourself up at 8 a.m. staring at a blank wall, FM does not take responsibility for any failed midterms, gaping professors, or general humiliation.­

While dressing down has become more or less the norm for Halloween, for some people, dressing up is serious business.
“I think being around costumes so much has ruined Halloween for me,” says Christine I. Moore, saleswoman at Harvard Square costume shop Hootenanny, minutes after ringing up a pair of black spandex hot pants and bag of feathers purchased by a customer. ‘They’ll cover you. I mean, I think it’ll be enough…’
But while Moore may be accustomed to shoppers seeking skimpy garb for the holiday, Lucy S. Bennett, who works at American Apparel, encountered a group of costume-seekers with an unusual quest.
“There was a group of ten guys [Saturday] for a crossdressing Halloween party and they were all just wearing the craziest things in the store. Like these tiny, shiny silk hot shorts over sparkly leggings and unitards and crazy headgear. All their junk was hanging out,” said Bennett.
Is everyone in Harvard square a closet flasher?
A little further up the square, at Oona’s Costume Shop, the atmosphere is decidedly more sedate. Molly Dixon sells a grey elephant hat to a couple, saying a turtleneck is all you need to “complete the look.”
The costumes at Oona’s span a wider ranger than the typical devils, angels, and bunnies. But Shenandoah  S. Aldrich of Oona’s scratches her cat’s ears as she contemplates the most outrageous costume request she’s received this year.
“There was one group of girls that really wanted to go dressed as swine flu. We gave them the angel wings, but there was really nothing for the swine part,” said Aldrich.
Here’s to hoping you all find what you’re looking for to cover—or uncover—your alter egos this year. FM will be watching. Bundle up.

Harvard may be over 300 years old, but that hasn’t stopped it from keeping up with the times. Like other colleges, Harvard created its very own Twitter account, tweeting away updates and announcements for over 4,000 following students, teachers, alums, and others as of this past Sunday. According to UniversitiesandColleges.org, it’s the #1 school in the country in number of followers, with Stanford and Yale at distant second and third places. And where Harvard tweets, others tweet back. Here’s what’s twittering around campus:

Last Friday, yet another celebrity caused a swarm of students, professors, and local residents to line the streets of Cambridge. Move over Suri Cruise, President of the United States Barack H. Obama was in town.
At noon in MIT’s Kresge Auditorium, President Obama addressed the nation’s need for clean energy. In addition to the packed auditorium, MIT had seven viewing rooms, where hundreds watched the speech via real time projection. Though watching Obama on a simulcast screen, cramped spectators stood patriotically during the opening National Anthem and clapped enthusiastically at his closing words, although some students were spotted cramming for midterms throughout.
Despite the apparent Obamamania, however, some remained skeptical. James S. DeLuca, a volunteer for Green Peace was one of a crowd of environmentalists protesting outside the speech. He said before the speech that Obama had not come out to say exactly what course of action the U.S. needs to take. “You can’t just put a piece of electrical tape over the check engine light,” DeLuca said.
Some of these protestors followed Obama downtown to the Westin Copley Place hotel, the site of a fundraiser for Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78. Here, they were joined by groups protesting for LGBT rights. A small crowd gathered around James Cardine, a local resident, as he spoke against society’s perception of nontraditional relationships. “We are born imperfect only because we are born here, in this country, at this time,” he said.
“[The protest is] not going to change anyone’s mind but it’s important if only to show people are passionate about the issue,” commented Harvard College Democrats Vice-President and Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Christian L. Garland ’10-’11. Protesters lingered even after its 2:30 P.M. scheduled end and Obama jetted off by the early evening.
Though his day in Boston was short, Obama still managed to create quite the stir. Suri, take note.

Paper, reading, midterm, paper, rinse, repeat–after a semester of arduous and sometimes tedious work, for many students, J-term is a welcome break from the frenetic pace of Harvard life. But it’s definitely not a reason to go into hibernation. While many J-term activities may not be officially organized by the University–students and student groups alike are taking the time to focus on what they really enjoy.
“We work so hard in the first semester and so hard in the second semester it’s kind of ridiculous to think of doing work for another for weeks. I understand that there are some people who would want to do work but I’m not one of them,’ said Matthew J. DaSilva ’12, who plans to participate in the A.R.T program.
This J-term, DaSilva plans to participate in the American Repertory Theater’s (A.R.T.) Institute for Advanced Theater Training, which will be giving undergraduates the opportunity to experience three weeks of the instruction it offers to graduate students throughout the year.
For students interested in community service, the Philips Brooks House Association is offering a range of activities for students looking to get involved over J-Term.
A number of the programs operating under PBHA’s purview, including the Small Claims Advisory Service, Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment, and the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, will continue to serve the community during the school recess.
“We’re basically keeping programs that need to be running during January in operation. As far as the programs changing in structure, I think the only real change is that students will have flexibility in what days they choose to volunteer, and be able to devote a little more time than they might be able to do in the semester to each project,” said PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10.
PBHA’s Habitat for Humanity is also sending two groups of 12 students to Izabal, Guatemala and New Orleans, LA from January 10-24.
Outside of PBHA, Tracy T. Han ’11 and Matthew C. Mulroy ’12 have initiated their own community service J-term project. They are currently organizing a group to travel to the Dominican Republic to work in a small community on water sustainability in partnership with DR Water and the Harvard Project for Sustainable Development.
“Maybe there would have been more established grants that we could have applied to, but I think the inspiration for this project comes from our own individual experiences and the way that we networked and designed the project comes from our own experiences,” Han said.
Harvard Hillel will also be taking students abroad, offering a Taglit Birthright trip to Israel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jay Carciero, 37, was shot and killed by an off-duty security guard at a clinic located a few blocks away from Harvard Medical School’s Longwood campus after stabbing his psychiatrist during a treatment session.
Medical School clinical psychiatry instructor Astrid Desrosiers, 49, suffered from multiple stab wounds and was rushed to Harvard-affiliate Mass. General Hospital for treatment.
According to Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis, who held a press conference to update the public following Tuesday’s incident, Desrosiers is currently in stable condition.
After hearing a woman scream in the treatment room, Paul M. Langone—a security guard not affiliated with the clinic but who happened to be nearby—burst into the room and shot Carciero three times after the psychiatric patient refused to drop his weapon.
Carciero, who had lived Reading, Mass., died from multiple gunshot wounds at Mass. General Hospital later that day.
Desrosiers had been treating Carciero for bipolar disorder.
The case is currently being investigated by the Boston Police Department, and Suffolk County District Attorney spokesman Jake Wark said that no formal charges or complaints have been made since yesterday evening.
Wark also added that investigators were pursuing “multiple avenues of inquiry,” one of which concerns Langone’s position as a special police officer—a title given to security guards authorized to carry firearms and make arrests.
Wark declined to confirm the names of parties involved or of any witnesses being interviewed in the course of the investigation.
No additional information regarding the incident has been released to the public, and spokespeople for both Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital declined to comment.
Mass. General security director Bonnie S. Michelman praised Langone for his “heroic” actions. Michelman added that “everyone was happy he was there.”
Langone, who won the Lowell Golden Gloves boxing title 12 years ago, worked in landscaping and bar security before training to become a special officer.
Gregory M. Springer, a general manager at the Boston bar Ned Devine’s and Langone’s friend of almost 15 years, called him an “upstanding guy.”
Langone had worked at Ned Devine’s, where he served as head of security for about six years, before he made the decision to train to becomea security officer.
“I was shocked to hear about the things that happened, but it didn’t surprise me that [Langone] would be involved in a situation like this where someone needed his help,” Springer said.
“He’s very good with people and he’s a caring guy who always takes care of others,” Springer added.
Attorney E. James Perullo, who is representing Carciero’s family, told Boston radio station WBZ yesterday that he was “stunned” by the stabbing incident.
Carciero had no prior record of violence, though he had struggled with unemployment and mental health issues, according to Perullo. Carciero is survived by his wife and four children.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
On a campus long known as a cradle for aspiring money-managers and a primary destination for Wall Street recruiters, over 750 enrollees packed the seats of Sanders Theater last year for Social Analysis 10—Ec 10—the College’s iconic introductory economics course. Two years ago, there were 800. Three years ago, the number topped 900—nearly a seventh of the undergraduate population.
But, says Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin ’59, there is another option: Social Analysis 72, an introductory look at the subject that dares to question what has become a religion for some. It’s a course that opposes the political bent of noted Ec 10 leader and former advisor to George W. Bush N. Gregory Mankiw. It’s a course with its own dissident history that, Marglin says, is as relevant as ever given the current economic climate. To some, it toes a Marxist line. But for Marglin and his followers it’s simply the little class that could: a powerful gadfly in the face of dominant economic wisdom.
“I think it’s fair to say I’m more liberal than most of my colleagues,” says Marglin, whose most recent book was titled: “The Dismal Science: How Thinking Like an Economist Undermines Community.” A tenured professor at Harvard since 1968, he says he is aware of the uniqueness of his outlook within the Littauer building, home of the Economics Department. “I don’t think there is anybody who shares my views,” he says.
But six years ago, Marglin found a permanent pulpit for those views in the form of a core class, overcoming the opposition from his own department. His revolutionary course—designed after a coalition of undergraduates known as Students for Humane and Responsible Economics (SHARE) formed a petition lobbying for a more liberal alternative to Ec 10—sought to offer a more critical introduction to the field of economics that would still incorporate basic economic principles.
Marglin says the class was largely structured around his own criticisms of Economics that he was putting together in his book. But he also wanted to incorporate a more holistic history of criticism. As advertised, the syllabus offers an array of economic ideologies, including writings from Adam Smith to John Keynes, and from Marglin to Mankiw himself (but no Karl Marx).
The course’s distinctive, left-leaning flavor was readily apparent against the backdrop of a department that appeared to have accepted the elevation of “mainstream economics” to a “fairly hegemonic position,” according to Marglin. By the time of Social Analysis 72’s inception, former Ec 10 Professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61 had stopped offering the specialized, “radical” sections that offered a Marxist critique to the Ec 10 curriculum. And it had been nine years since he had phased out Marglin’s guest lectures.
It’s an attitude whose authority may have been shaken by the recent economic downturn, Marglin notes. “Non-economists have much less faith in economists and in mainstream economics than they did two years ago,” he says.
“The economics profession will probably be the last to know it.”
A FLAGSHIP ALTERNATIVE
Marglin originally intended his class to be an alternative to the Microeconomics half of the full-year Ec 10 course—a viable lead-in to the class’ second semester. But the Economics Department, in an overwhelming vote that featured only two dissenters, elected not to count Social Analysis 72 for concentration credit, meaning that the course, to this day, fails to serve as a prerequisite for most high-level economics courses.
“In the view of my colleagues, there’s two kinds of economics—there’s good economics and there’s bad economics,” he says. “If I wasn’t doing their economics, than I couldn’t be doing good economics because that was what they were doing.”
Instead, Marglin’s course fulfills Core as well as Gen Ed requirements, and also meets the economics requirement for Social Studies, the third-largest undergraduate concentration. The first year that Social Analysis 72 was offered, 79 students enrolled—a figure that correlated almost exactly with a drop in enrollment in Ec 10. Since then, the course has consistently seen enrollment levels of over 70 students, although, according to Head Teaching Fellow Andras Tilcsik ’05, that number dropped to 60 this year.
Currently taught by Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, Ec 10 remains a two-semester course that serves as the introductory anchor for the Economics Department. “Ec 10 is supposed to be the flagship of the department,” says Mankiw, whom Marglin considers a “colleague and friend.”
The Ec 10 curriculum follows Mankiw’s own textbook, “Principles of Economics,” which Marglin had used for his course until switching for a textbook with more liberal authors because he says it fits better with his specific course.
“The striking thing is how similar the two texts are,” he says. “Despite the fact that Mankiw was known as a conservative economist.”
For his part, Mankiw says that he believes his course exposes students to mainstream economic principles without substantial methodological bias. “I try as best I can to keep my personal political philosophy from what we do in Ec 10.”
“Ec 10 has really been a leading course nationally in terms of how introductory economics should be taught,” says Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell. “My colleagues and I think that the course is a broad mainstream introduction to the economics field.”
Jeffrey A. Miron, director of undergraduate studies for the economics department, says that Social Analysis 72 does not fulfill the introductory requirement for the economics concentration because it doesn’t cover all of the material offered in the two-semester Ec 10 course. But while it does not count for concentration credit, he said, the economics department still endorsed the course because “we’re not about shutting down options.”
Professor Feldstein, formerly of Ec 10, does not believe Social Analysis 72 to be an alternative for the full year course. Rather, he explains in an e-mail, it is for students who have taken Ec 10 “and want to see a particular school of criticism.”
“There are various other critiques of mainstream economics…that students could read about but that are not taught in the department,” he writes.
“Some people might call it a liberal critique or a Marxist critique,” says Miron of the course. But, he says, there can be a clear division between the views of the professor and the particular curriculum.
Miron says he tries no to let his views come out in his intermediate microeconomic theory course. But like Marglin, he offers a different course in which his views align more closely with the curriculum, entitled  “A Libertarian Perspective on Economic and Social Policy.”
And at their base, the various economic courses might not be so different. “Supply curve still slopes up and the demand curve still slopes down,” says Miron.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Jason E. Sandler ’12 is hunched over a toilet in Pennypacker, explaining the best way to reach every stretch of porcelain, chrome, and tile in the bathroom. He pauses to describe his summer molecular biology research that could aid in early detection of atherosclerosis, before pointing out how best to eliminate soap scum from shower walls.
Sandler has been working for Dorm Crew—a branch of Harvard’s Facilities Maintenance Organization that employs students to clean in-suite bathrooms during the year—since February. He says he knew he would want a term-time job before starting college and chose Dorm Crew because of its high wages and had flexible hours.
Over the past decade, the College has begun to offer increasingly generous financial aid packages, often with the stated intention of freeing students from working term-time jobs to cover their tuition costs.
Concurrently, the number of hours logged by the average dorm crew worker has fallen by more than half. But the number of students participating in Dorm Crew—which the program head says is one of the highest-paying student jobs on campus—has increased.
This particular bathroom is surprisingly clean, Sandler says, but he isn’t especially squeamish.
“It’s just a toilet, it’s nothing...a lot of people can’t imagine doing things like cleaning toilets, but there are worse things in the world,” he says.
And to Sandler, whether he feels there is a stigma attached to working for Dorm Crew is among the least relevant questions about his job.
“You are associated with a middle or low income background—that isn’t a problem for me. I’m not ashamed of it, I’m proud. Some people ask, ‘you take pride in cleaning toilets?’ Well actually, I do,” Sandler says. “If you can do this well that’s a model for other things in your life.”
A CHANGING FACE
In September 1998, the University allocated an additional $2,000 to every College student’s financial aid package. Dean of the Faculty Jeremy R. Knowles told The Crimson at the time that the funds would allow students more freedom in their extracurricular endeavors.
“With several iterations of increasing financial aid there was a dramatic fall off in work force. The intended effect of providing increasing financial aid was that students wouldn’t have to work and could focus on their studies—and it seemed to work pretty well,” says Robert F. Wolfreys, crew supervisor in the custodial services division of FMO.
In the past ten years, the total number of hours logged by dorm crew workers has fallen by 67 percent, but in the past five years, the number of students participating has risen by almost 30 percent.
“In my experience, it’s very rare for students to be doing this because they absolutely have to, it’s more for discretionary income...Not that [discretionary] income is not important, but the income isn’t an absolute necessity,” he says.
Many Dorm Crew workers use their wages to pay for summer programs abroad, or to supplement unpaid internships, says Wolfreys.
Dorm Crew captain Duncan F. Moore ’11 says financial independence was the reason he started working Dorm Crew. Last summer, Duncan used the $3,500 he earned during Spring Cleanup—the four weeks of intensive cleaning after final exams end—to pay for a summer language program in Sweden.
And Andy A. Parchman ’11 says the money from Fall Cleanup his freshman year was “just extra spending money, so I could buy three more girls drinks on a Saturday night.”
NOT-SO-DIRTY WORK
Regardless of what dorm crew workers spend their extra income on, the question of class divide and social stigma always arises when the conversation is about cleaning toilets.
“It comes with ideas about social class that people want to hide from on all different levels,” says Dorm Crew captain Jack Cen ’11. “There are poor and rich students who wouldn’t want to do it for the same reasons.”
Cen says that when he first started, he was worried about interactions with the peers whose bathrooms he was cleaning.
“When people who know me see me clean they sometimes feel uncomfortably because it humanizes something they don’t think about,” Cen says. “People say, ‘You’re at Harvard, why are you cleaning bathrooms?’ but it’s a job that needs to be done—getting into Harvard doesn’t raise you above anyone else.”
Those students who do work Dorm Crew emphasize that they choose to do so.
“I could be doing other things,” says Sandler, “But I choose to spend more than the minimum number of hours working Dorm Crew.”
And apart from occasionally opening the door on a boy in his undergarments, Marlee Chong ’13 says she has never felt uncomfortable doing her job.
Daniel Gomez, whose daughter Alexis C. Gomez ’13 decided to join Dorm Crew after her experience with fall cleanup, says he was surprised but not opposed to his daughter’s decision.
“You don’t have to work Dorm Crew—there’s no one forcing you to do it,” says Gomez. “If you were assigned this kind of work, that’s when there would be a stigma.”
A DORM CREW ADVANTAGE?
Wolfreys says Dorm Crew alumni have told him their experience has helped shape their later career paths.
“One student said that he felt the only reason he got hired by Goldman Sachs was because he was working Dorm Crew,” he says. “They expressed amazement at his work—and this student was only working Dorm Crew to help his roommate, a captain, who was short on staff.”
Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career Services, says that she believes having Dorm Crew on a resume might prove advantageous for certain professions. Library jobs, for example, might help students land a research position, while Dorm Crew might help with more hands on occupations—like medicine or banking, she says.
“The fact that someone is willing to roll up his or her sleeves has a particular appeal,” Mount says. “I think it shows stick-to-itiveness, in medical school, for example, you will not be in glamorous situations.”
Jonathan R. Murrow ’97 says his experience as a Dorm Crew captain helps him motivate residents at the Medical College of Georgia, where he works as a professor and practitioner of cardiology.
In a conversation with Wolfreys at the time he was starting his residency, Murrow said that after a spring cleanup experience, he was not worried about long hours—he had already completed one of “the most difficult tasks he would ever do,” says Wolfreys.
“I will definitely put Dorm Crew on my resume to show my organization skills and leadership,” Cen says. “It also shows the ability to give and take criticism—people at Harvard sometimes have an issue with that.”
“The prospect of being told to clean a toilet strikes people differently,” Cen says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University officials may increase endowment spending by as much as $50 million this year in light of a Massachusetts state law passed this summer, but they have not yet decided how to take advantage of the new legislation, Harvard’s Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore said in an interview this month.
Under the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, which was drafted in 1972 and previously governed endowment payouts, institutions were only allowed to spend income from an endowed fund if its current value–including accrued interest–exceeded the original value.
After suffering a 27 percent investment loss in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the University found itself unable to tap many of its most-recently endowed funds, which had fallen in value to less than the amount bequeathed by the donor and are considered “underwater.”
The new legislation, the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act passed in July, now permits institutions to spend as much of an endowment fund “as the institution determines is prudent,” meaning that Harvard can now determine appropriate expenditures from more recently acquired endowments.
The difference in available income from the endowment is about $50 million, Shore said. With an endowment payout rate over 6 percent, this indicates that the new legislation loosens restrictions on about $800 million of Harvard’s $26 billion endowment.
“Harvard’s endowments tend to be quite old, so they have a lot of appreciation built up in there,” Shore said. “Underwater funds’ challenges have been biggest in the places that have received the newest endowment funds.”
In the past five years, both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School have completed major capital campaigns, raising $476 million and $599 million respectively.
The actual increase in endowment spending has yet to be determined, according to Shore, as the University is in the process of formulating a new policy to address spending from underwater funds. But Shore said he expected the new income to be less than the $50 million figure. Excessive spending from a specific endowment fund, especially one that has already fallen below its original value, can erode at its long-term value—a crucial consideration for financial planners at the University, since most endowments are meant to last in perpetuity.
In recent months, University administrators have also taken steps to ensure that past gifts—which often come with strict spending guidelines—are flexible enough to allocate funds more efficiently.
University officials are currently evaluating whether these restrictive agreements can be renegotiated to match available resources with current needs.
Last month, Harvard renegotiated terms to an agreement with a South Korean foundation that loosened restrictions on a $13 million endowment established in 1975 for Korean studies. The funds, which were originally dedicated to endow a senior faculty member’s position in the field, can now be used to support tenure-track faculty, visiting scholars in the department, and students studying the economy and society of modern Korea.

In light of the fast-approaching Undergraduate Council Presidential Elections, UC insiders have confirmed the two leading tickets. But this year, they say, will be a bit different. Entering the race from a variety of backgrounds, the candidates will face new institutional challenges in light of budget cuts and a restructured UC.
The two primary lineups are drawn from all areas of student life. UC Budget Cuts Task Force Chair Johnny F. Bowman ’11 confirmed that he intends to run for UC president with Rules Committee Chair Eric N. Hysen ’11 as his vice-president. Education Committee Vice Chair George J.J. Hayward ’11, a Crimson editor, is another major contender who confirmed his candidacy alongside UC representative Felix M. Zhang ’11 as his vice president.
‘EVEN MATCH’
Each of the candidates brings a unique perspective and background.
Bowman, a Pforzheimer House resident, has been one of the most prominent student advocates in budget-cut related issues over the last year, involved with groups ranging from the Student Labor Action Movement to the Restructuring Student Life student-faculty working group.
Hysen, who is running as Bowman’s vice president, has had a long history on the UC. Elected his freshman year, the Mather House rep is considered by many UC members to be one of the most knowledgeable reps.
Hayward, who is running against Bowman, has spent much of his time on the UC involved in advocacy projects, notably issues affecting Quad life, including his own Currier House. He is also a member of the Black Students Association and the Veritas Financial Group.
Hayward’s vice-presidential candidate, Zhang, has also been heavily involved in student groups. Currently, he is co-vice president of the Chinese Students Association and a director in the Veritas Financial Group. A Cabot resident, he has also been involved in organizations such as the Asian American Association and the Institute of Politics.
“It’s an even match,” said current UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 of the two tickets. “I don’t think [an election] has ever been so hard to predict.”
UC insider Harry T. Rimalower ’10 said he thinks the tickets plan to focus on different issues­—Hayward and Zhang on student groups, and Bowman and Hysen on budget cuts.
“Budget cuts are going to cast a shadow over everything,” Rimalower said. “It’s going to be question of how much [Hayward and Zhang] can draw attention to student groups.”
A ‘FASCINATING’ ELECTION
“The UC is at a really important time now, a really fragile time,” said Flores.
In the past year, the UC has experienced drastic constitutional change, resulting in a larger Council with three more committees.
One side effect of the changes, according to Flores, is that the candidates coming from the “inside” no longer have a significant advantage because the structure is so new.
“It’s highly unusual that one of the presidential candidates does not come from the executive board,” Flores said. “[Furthermore] there’s no women, there’s two social club candidates [Bowman and Zhang], no one’s really an insider except [Hysen], and there are two first semester UC candidates. It should be a fascinating election.”
UC members also predict that the political atmosphere of the election will be much less charged than last year.
“Legislation couldn’t get passed [last year] because there was a political agenda behind every vote,” Rimalower said. “[Hayward and Bowman] actually like each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the 2008 subprime mortgage meltdown revealed widespread unfamiliarity with the intricacies of personal finance, one former Harvard Business School student is on a mission to educate young people about managing their money.
On Nov. 15, Alexa L. M. von Tobel ’06 will launch LearnVest.com, an interactive financial information Web site geared toward women.
The start-up features personalized information on credit scores, mortgages, and retirement savings, among other fiscal topics. Von Tobel, who is taking a leave of absence from HBS to work on the project, calls it “the Cliff Notes for personal finance.”
“The bottom line is most people don’t know what the difference between a debit and a credit card is,” said von Tobel, adding that most students at Harvard will graduate without ever having taken a class in personal finance.
Von Tobel—who first envisioned the Web site during her senior year at Harvard—said that LearnVest aims to be more personalized than other financial Web sites. It walks users through financial milestones from getting a first job to paying off student loans, then offers gift cards and other rewards when they complete units on the site.
The Web site is designed for women under 30, though von Tobel emphasized that LearnVest is open to anyone.
Brian C. Pfeifer, a second-year HBS student who worked at LearnVest over the summer, said that the female focus is appropriate, since “a lot of finance in general is catered to men.”
“What [LearnVest] is doing is creating an environment that’s welcoming to women, making women feel comfortable,” he added.
The startup has already exceeded fundraising expectations. In September 2009, LearnVest sought to raise $750,000 from venture capitalists and angel investors, according to von Tobel. They ended up raising $1.1 million.
The Web site won early support from start-up experts. The technology business blog TechCrunch selected it as one of the year’s top 50 Web startups.
Those who have worked with her said that von Tobel has been a visionary leader for LearnVest.
Von Tobel was accepted to HBS when she applied as a Harvard senior—but she deferred admission to work for a hedge fund owned by Morgan Stanley and entered HBS in the fall of 2008. She took her leave of absence that spring.
“Alexa is one of the most driven people I know,” said Chelsea L. Ono Horn ’10, one of two Harvard seniors who interned at the company this past summer. “She knows how to motivate people, and she has a clear vision of what she wants.”
To prepare for LearnVest’s November launch, its 10 full-time employees in New York are now “working tirelessly” to put the final touches on the site after feedback from beta users, von Tobel said.
Meanwhile, Ono Horn and other former interns from Princeton and Duke are busy spreading the word about LearnVest to students preparing to enter the workforce.
“As soon as you leave college, you’re sort of stranded,” Ono Horn said. “Often, you don’t know what you don’t know, but LearnVest does a good job of walking you through.”

Harvard students eager to try out Microsoft’s Windows 7 on University computers will have to wait until FAS IT approves the new operating system.
Microsoft released its most recent version of Windows, Windows 7, to the public last Thursday but the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology (FAS IT) will not install the system on its computers until its staff can deal with issues of compatibility.
“We have to establish a consistent environment for a lot of different types of software, which may not be compatible with the new system,” explained Noah S. Selsby ’94, Senior Client Technology Advisor for FAS IT, in an emailed statement. “FAS IT tends to be very conservative when upgrading our operating systems in our labs because of the wide variety of software that is needed for coursework.” Selsby added that in many cases, the software may not be compatible with new operating systems, which could destabilize the University’s operating environment.
But Selsby added that FAS IT is excited about the prospect of installing the new system.
“Our testers are quite enthusiastic about the new OS and see it as a major step forward from [Windows] Vista,” he wrote.
On its Web site, Microsoft advertises Windows 7’s increased speed and more convenient desktop management, as well as improvements to Windows Media Center and file sharing. Retail prices for Windows 7 upgrades start at $119.99.
Selsby also recommends that students not update their own computers with Windows 7 before FAS IT can issue a statement of support for the online system.
“As we did with Snow Leopard for Mac, we will be publishing a grid of known issues and software incompatibilities that students will find useful in making the decision as to whether they should upgrade,” Selsby wrote. “Students who purchase computers with Windows 7 pre-installed may not have much of a choice, so we will always do our best efforts to provide support should they encounter issues.”
Keito Uchiyama ’11, President of the Harvard Computer Society and a Crimson affiliate, who has been using a version of Windows 7 for a year, said he likes the experience. “It’s solid and looks good,” he said.
He added that he would not recommend that Harvard switch its computers over immediately because it uses so many clients. Uchiyama also mentioned that Ubuntu, a competing operating system, is due to release a new version today, which gives FAS IT another option. Harvard currently uses Ubuntu on several Science Center computers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A female Harvard University employee reported that she was attacked while walking on Grant St. near DeWolfe St. on Tuesday.
The attack occurred at approximately 10:15 p.m. on Tuesday, according to a community advisory e-mail issued by the Harvard University Police Department.
The victim escaped uninjured, the e-mail stated.
According to the statement, which was sent to the College community yesterday afternoon, the victim reported that an unidentified man approached her from behind and slipped a thin rope over her head.
She was able to escape by crouching down, turning, and pushing her assailant away.
She then fled down Grant St. and watched her attacker “stagger” down the walkway leading behind 5 Cowperthwaite St., the e-mail stated.
The victim was unable to provide a detailed description of the suspect.
The incident is being investigated by the Cambridge Police Department, as it did not occur on University property.
Cambridge police spokesperson Alexa Manocchio said last night that the police department is not releasing information about the alleged incident at this time.
In May 2008, a female undergraduate was victim of a similar attack outside Lamont Library. She reported that an unidentified man wrapped a thin wire around her neck as she walked down the stairs next to Pusey Library.
According to a cautionary e-mail circulated by the student’s roommate after the attack, the victim was able to escape unhurt by kicking the offender in the groin.
Tuesday night’s incident prompted HUPD’s second community advisory this month.
On Oct. 3, a male faculty member reported that he was robbed at gunpoint by an unknown man while walking north of Harvard Divinity School.

Nina Kucharczyk puts a new spin on being busy, even for a Harvard student.  Aside from balancing classes, clubs, and a social life, the New York native is competing on not one, but two varsity athletic teams.  Officially recruited for lacrosse, Kucharczyk recently joined the field hockey team as a walk-on after participating in a few practices with the Crimson squad.
The key to her success—love for sports.
“Nina just loves to play,” Kucharczyk’s mother said of the freshman. “That’s what sets her apart.  She’s not the most talented player, but she is the most competitive and passionate.”
During high school Kucharczyk was also a multi-sport athlete, playing field hockey and lacrosse, as well as running indoor track.
When the multi-sport standout arrived at Harvard, she intended to focus on lacrosse. But due to the field hockey team’s small size, Harvard coach Sue Caples issued an open invitation to those athletes with experience in the sport to join the team for some full-field scrimmages. After trying it out, Kucharczyk realized this was a chance she couldn’t pass up.
“Coach Caples approached me after a scrimmage and offered a spot on the team,” Kucharczyk said.  “This was such a great opportunity that I might never have had at another place.”
Danielle Gallagher, Kucharczyk’s high school lacrosse coach, and Steve Sproul, her high school field hockey and indoor track coach, are not surprised by her decision to play two sports.
“It’s tough for college kids to play more than one sport,” Gallagher said. “But Nina is such a well-balanced person, and is able to have competitiveness not only on the field, but in the classroom and in life.”
“During high school,” Sproul recalled, “Nina was training for the Indoor National Track and Field meet while practicing and competing in varsity lacrosse.  She was able to do both exceptionally well, which is not something many athletes can manage.”
Nina feels the pressure of her new commitment to two varsity sports, but is not worried about coping.
“The Ivy League makes [playing two sports] do-able.” Kucharczyk said. “I’ll be busy of course, but it’s manageable.  The coaches and my teammates are great, and have been really supportive and welcoming.”
Kucharczyk’s Harvard teammates, from both field hockey and lacrosse, appreciate her drive.
“The fact that Nina is playing two varsity sports while still going to school at Harvard shows the kind of person she is,” said junior lacrosse player Jess Halpern. “She is a really hard and great worker...and has already improved in the two months she’s been here.”
“Obviously being able to step on the field hockey team so late in the season is a difficult thing to do,” said field hockey co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon, “but [Nina] has already been a great asset and has fit in seamlessly. It’s a testament to her character and athleticism that she is able to balance two Division I athletic teams.”
Kucharczyk’s athleticism is evident from the moment she takes the field, especially through her aggression and speed.
“[Nina’s] one of the toughest athletes I’ve ever coached.” Sproul said. “She’s always game ready…and never quits.  She’s one of those athletes who gives 100 percent effort whether she’s competing against the toughest or weakest opponent.”
Gallagher described an occasion in Kucharczyk’s senior lacrosse season that portrayed her athleticism and competitive spirit in “a nut shell.”
The team was taking one of its biggest rivals and, as a defender, Kucharczyk would have the opportunity to match up against West Babylon High School’s best player. But, when her opponent was held out with an injury, Gallagher noted her star player’s disappointment.
“Nina was physically upset because she couldn’t guard the best player and shut her down.” Gallagher said. “In her eyes, that was her job...That’s exactly the kind of competitor she is. She never backs down from any challenge, and goes full throttle in every practice and game.”
While Kucharczyk clearly possesses the fire to compete in Division I, she still faces the challenge of learning the technicalities of both sports—the plays, the rules, and the formations—in an environment where most of her teammates focus on just one skill set.
“Our coach is adamant about [freshmen] gaining the new information to play at a more physical college level.” Halpern said.  “Nina is taking in all the information and is putting it to her game.”
“[Nina] has been working as hard as she possibly can to learn the technicalities of field hockey in the last month,” Goodman-Bacon said. “She has a great positive attitude and perseveres through everything.”
Kucharczyk knows this positive attitude is essential for success.
“To be an athlete at this stage, you really have to be driven to win.” Kucharczyk said. “I don’t have the stick skills of the other girls on the field hockey team, but I definitely want to win and am willing to work my butt off to make that possible.”
With such a drive to win and a love for sports, Kucharczyk willingly accepts the difficulties of a busy schedule, and has the potential to not only manage, but to thrive.
Above all, she keeps her mother’s advice for success in mind: “At a place like Harvard with so many choices, you just have to love what you do, and you’ll do it well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nines were wild last night.
For the second game in a row, Harvard field hockey surrendered nine goals as ninth-ranked Boston College (13-4, 1-3 ACC) defeated the Crimson (5-9, 2-3 Ivy) 9-1 last night.
“It definitely wasn’t our best game,” sophomore forward Allie Kimmel said. “I think we just couldn’t match BC’s strength and speed.”
Eagles senior captain Chelsey Feole added to her career season, netting five goals in just 29 minutes of play to push her team-leading total to 23 goals on the season.
While the Harvard defense stood strong for the game’s opening minutes, keeping Boston College from scoring off its first four shot attempts, the floodgates opened in the 10th minute.
Feole got things started for the Eagles, recovering her own shot attempt after it was deflected by freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos and driving it home.
Things got bad quickly for the Crimson.
Boston College managed to put the ball past the Harvard goalie under a minute later, this time courtesy of Courtney Tavener, who took the pass on the left side of the field and sent it past Tassopoulos. Feole’s second goal came just over a minute later, as the Eagles scored three times in just over two minutes of play.
“I think we could have definitely played with them,” Kimmel said. “We just couldn’t get our momentum back after their first goal.”
And the goals just kept coming for Boston College.
After a fourteen-minute lull where the Eagles failed to convert on their next four shot attempts, Feole completed her hat trick, this time off a pass from Tavener.
Once again, Feole’s teammates followed the captain’s lead, scoring two goals in the game’s next eight minutes, giving Boston College the commanding 6-0 lead heading into the break.
Feole would not rest in the second half, contributing to her team’s final three scores. The five-foot forward from Windham, New Hampshire sent a pass to Janna Anctil in the 45th minute that the junior forward sent home for her 10th goal of the season. Anctil’s score gave Feole her 11th assist on the year.
Feole rounded out an impressive stat sheet with her fourth and fifth goals of the game, which came in the 47th and 54th minutes. The senior standout’s final tally gave her team nine goals on the night, its highest output of the season, as Boston College cruised throughout the contest.
The loss to another cross-town opponent marked a slight improvement for a Harvard team that failed to come up with only a single shot attempt in its 9-0 shutout loss to No.4 Princeton this past weekend.
Junior forward Chloe Keating ended the Crimson’s 165-minute scoreless drought, notching a goal off a penalty corner in the 55th minute.
Freshman defender Molly Stansik got the Harvard offense going, taking a shot that was saved by Eagles’ goalie Nicole Barry. But the offensive possession resulted in a penalty corner for the Crimson.
Senior co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon took the corner for Harvard. The ball ended up in the possession of Georgia McGillivray, who passed it to Keating. Keating received the pass, turned, and tipped it past the Boston College goalkeeper, saving the Crimson from another shutout.
Keating’s second-half tally ended her own personal five-game scoreless streak, which dated back to her game-winning goal against Brown in overtime on October 3.
Following the score, Harvard’s defense stood strong for the remainder of the game, managing to keep the Eagles from reaching double-figures in the game’s final sixteen minutes.
“I think at that point we were sick of seeing the ball going into the net,” Tassopoulus said. “It was a little late but at least we made the changes.”
After back-to-back defeats to top-ten opponents, the Crimson looks to get back on track in its senior night game against Dartmouth this Saturday.
“I think [last night’s game] made us better for Saturday,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “We’re just sort of trying to use it as preparation for our upcoming [game].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So I finally reached senior year, and I was ready to kick back and let senioritis take over. But, it turns out that life had other plans for me. For the last month I’ve been dropped into the life of a varsity athlete.
And no, I don’t mean that I suddenly discovered the vertical leap that I’ve always hoped to have or the hand-eye coordination that I once thought I did. Rather, I and a sizeable fraction of my classmates have been traveling around the country once or twice a week, in an effort to line up post-college plans.
I’ve been traveling so much that I think I can finally grasp just how much effort, organization, and commitment it takes to live the off-field life of a varsity athlete. I’ve gained tremendous respect for those among us who can balance the incredibly heavy loads of travel, school, and sport, as so many of our student athletes do.
Before this year, I glamorized in my mind the life of a frequently-travelling student or student-athlete. What could be better, I thought, than going to new, exciting places, seeing new things, and feeling independent and free? And to top it all off, the student-athletes get to compete for glory in the sport they love.
It took less than an hour into my first of many delayed trips for me to realize just how un-romantic it is to be on the road.
To start, it is practically impossible to be comfortable while travelling. Seats are inevitably too cramped and often dirty—good luck trying to open your laptop or your textbook once the passenger in front of you tilts his or her chair back. Distractions abound while food is scarce and unappealing.
But, from my perspective as a student on the interview circuit, the worst part of travel is that it takes me out of the rhythm of college life. Time off campus means more than just missed classes. It translates directly into confused schedules, missed commitments, and—crucially—a struggle to focus on academics while at home or on the road. Nothing showed me just how academic our campus’s collective mindset is than being away from it yet trying to keep motivated to work hard. It’s tough to get riled up about, say, marginal cost curves or the student’s t-test when you’re not going to be in class for days.
But that’s enough complaining—my point is just that it’s so impressive to me that so many among us manage to survive and even excel despite the incredibly high demands of travel, sport, and coursework.
In some circles, athletes are criticized for sacrificing academics to participate in their sport. The issue of which should take precedence—athletics or academics—is an important institutional and personal question that I won’t take sides on here.
But it’s clear to me that many of the athletes I’ve interacted with both as friends and during my years as a sports writer for The Crimson go to extraordinary lengths to thrive in both arenas.
Having seen how demanding even a “light” academic load can be in the context of nearly non-stop travel, I know it is impossible to understate just how remarkable an achievement this balancing act is. To be sure, the stereotyped view that athletes approach their academic responsibilities flippantly has a kernel of truth to it. There are some within the student-athlete population for whom academics are just not a priority, but the same could be said of a subset of students within any larger group at Harvard.
My month on the road has taught me many things, but perhaps more than anything else, it has beaten out of me the jealousy and mild contempt I used to hold toward the lifestyles of those who represent their teams on Saturdays. It is exceedingly hard to travel, study, and perform under pressure, and even harder to do it well.
So, to all those on the travelling squad—athletes or not—I tip my hat to you. I just hope that in a few more months of travel, at least I’ll get to reap the rewards. Maybe I’ll even get a good jump-shot.

You know the swine flu pandemic is serious when Harvard Medical  School decides to get into the game commercially.
This week, the school's Health Publications Division released an iPhone application named “The HMSMobile Swine Flu Center," now selling for $1.99.
The goal? To utilize Harvard’s extensive knowledge in order to “tell you how you can reduce your risk of contracting H1N1 anytime, anywhere through your iPhone," according to the trippy promotional trailer below:

After the jump, FlyBy dissects what this two-dollar technological wonder actually does.
Using videos, animations, and text, the iPhone application allows you to:
The application is available on the App store in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. It can be purchased here.
Overall, the application does what it sets out to do, which is to provide the public with timely information on prevention and outbreaks of the H1N1 virus. The features are easy to use and the graphics are well designed. The fact that people have instant access to the most updated information – where there is an outbreak, when the first symptoms are spotted, how to prevent infection – relieves some of the anxiety about the global pandemic. Still. This can't be good for all those hypochondriacs out there.
And what if (gasp!) one doesn't own an iPhone? The rest of us will have to make do with Google searches.

Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who was arrested by Cambridge police for breaking into his own house in July, went pubbing with Sgt. James Crowley at River Gods Bar & Restaurant last night. The two seem to have become way more chummy since the summer, when Gates virulently alleged that he had been racial profiled by police and called on Crowley to "beg my forgiveness."
(FlyBy's other favorite Gates-ism: when asked by police to step out of his home, Gates, the University professor and MacArthur "Genius Grant" recipient, reportedly told Crowley, "I'll speak with your mama outside.")
River Gods' owner, Jackie Linnane, told FlyBy that the pair stayed for over an hour and chatted amicably, but she wouldn't specify what they were served other than an appetizer and beer. The River Gods menu includes everything from standard cheeseburgers to "Korean Handrolls" to "Goddess Salad" topped with arugula, pears, and bacon.
"We were really surprised that this even got out," Linnane said, noting that Gates has frequented the pub in the past. "When they came in the early evening it wasn't too busy; they were pretty secluded."
When the duo chatted with President Obama at the White House in July over peanuts and pretzels—the so-called "Beer Summit"—Gates reportedly had a mug of Sam Adams Light while Crowley had a Blue Moon with slice of orange. (Obama had a Bud Light while Vice President Biden stuck with a nonalcoholic Buckler.)

When your email telling FAS-IT that something is wrong with your email bounces, you know things have gotten bad. Really bad.
A number of FlyBy readers were slightly concerned that emails being sent to their FAS addresses were bouncing when they were forwarded to their Gmail accounts, after a similar problem was reported a few weeks ago.
To find out why, FlyBy emailed Noah S. Selsby ’94, Senior Client Technology Advisor of FAS from—shame on us—a Gmail account.
Surely enough, it bounced.
With the flashy “Delivery Status Notification (Failure)” message sneering at us from our inbox, we promptly picked up the phone and called Selsby up, demanding to know why Harvard’s servers were rejecting us.
After consulting the email gurus of FAS, who then investigated the problem this morning, FlyBy has Selsby’s response after the jump.
“It appears that Gmail suffered the exact same problem that FAS and @College suffered at previous times,” Selsby said. “Gmail has been declared spam by a number of spam-monitoring companies. As a result, a number of third party filters are filtering out Gmail.”
Great. Spam filtering sites think Gmail is spam. Can you say ‘ironic’?
“Essentially, we’re talking about two third party companies that are not really meeting eye to eye on what the nature of their particular service is,” Selsby said. “So it's kind of ironic, but the same thing that Gmail did to @College, SpamHouse [one of the Spam-filtering sites in question] did to Gmail.”
Yes, it is kind of ironic.
Selsby said that they are working to resolve the issue right now, if it has not been resolved already. In the meantime, he recommends that students notify FAS-IT (obviously not by email) if there are still problems sending to or from Harvard email accounts with Gmail.
Makes me wish I still had my AOL account.

True Love Revolution has been making a lot of noise since The Crimson's publication of Silpa Kovali's editorial last week, called "True Love Revision," in which the author examined points made by TLR president Rachel L. Wagley '11 in an interview.  The piece has sparked a flurry of responses from TLR members, particularly Wagley and former co-president Leo J. Keliher '10, and the conversation—a tense one, it would be safe to say—is all over the Web. FlyBy thought it would be helpful to break down the situation. Check out all the links after the jump.
So, the TLR blog posted a "Response to an anti-TLR Crimson editorial," in which Keliher wrote, "If I had to distill [Kovali's] piece, it would run: 'I interviewed the co-president of a group I disagree with, I misconstrued her statements, and thereby showed the whole group is irrational.'" The conversation didn't stop there. The blog post generated a couple of comments, including one by Kovali and another by Keliher.
Keliher then used the gist of his comment on his own blog post as a letter to the Crimson today. Which elicited a comment from Wagley which was essentially a re-post of Keliher's original blog post. Things getting meta yet?
And then earlier this week, infamous ex-sex blogger Lena Chen '09-'10 wrote an editorial in the Crimson entitled "The Abstinence Mystique." The title says it all. But the TLR people seemed to have taken Chen's message with a better attitude, claiming in yet another blog post that the piece was "more civil than last week’s Crimson fail." But in a comment to her own article, Chen says that Wagley's blog post "fails to address the contradictions I bring up about TLR's interpretation of feminism." More of her thoughts, Chen says, can be found on her personal blog.
Did you catch all that? FlyBy wonders if all involved constituents even had to utter one word to each other during this whole virtual debate. Maybe it's better that way.
