After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a few minutes on Monday night, the Cambridge City Council meeting looked more like a poetry slam.
 
“My love for this UB family ain’t about me. It’s about we,” the enthusiastic high school bard recited. “When the going gets tough and the game gets rough, I can lean on my sisters and brothers.”
 
The poet made his appearance on behalf of Upward Bound, a program run by MIT and Wellesley which offers a demanding academic program in a college setting for students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School. He and many of his classmates, teachers, and program alumni packed Sullivan Hall to appeal for funding from the city to fill the gap left by federal budget cuts.
 
Without the City Council, they said, the program must end.
 
“This is a do-or-die moment,” Council member Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 characterized the decision.
 
Though some councillors expressed concern about retaining grants that would support the roughly $400,000 annual expenditure in the future, the order to rescue the program carried unanimously, 9-0.
 
One student, a senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, said that she and her fellow students were devastated when they heard the program would be closed due to lack of funding. “A handful of senior girls and myself began to panic in a way I’d never seen before then,” she said, urging the Council to intervene. “Only when we are allowed to learn without restraints are we able to live our lives to the fullest.”
 
When the poet took the podium, Cambridge Democratic City Committee Ward 1 Chair Joseph Aiello felt moved to speak too. “Try to get these kids some funding because I am sitting over here in tears listening to these kids talk,” he said.
 
The meeting was well-attended by alumni of the program, including Robin Harris, the principal of Fletcher-Maynard Academy in Cambridge, who credited Upward Bound for her success. “My parents had a little bit of something to do with that, but the MIT/Wellesley Upward Bound had a lot of something to do with that,” she said.
 
Upward Bound is geared toward low-income students and first-generation immigrants. According to the MIT Public Service Center, historically over 90 percent of graduates of the program have gone on to enroll in post-secondary education programs.
 
Vice-Mayor E. Denise Simmons moved to suspend the rules of procedure so the policy item could be discussed as one of the first orders of business, allowing the young advocates to hear the debate and the result of the vote.
 
Reeves, who expressed strong support of the program, described it as one of the first uses of federal funding for urban education to come out of the civil rights era. “This was a nation’s investment in the reality that everyone in America should be able to have the opportunity to make something of him or herself,” he said.
 
“The proof of the pudding is in the pudding,” he said, referring to the students in attendance. “This is very good pudding!”
 
The topic of funding for another social program occupied the later portion of the meeting.
 
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, a longtime supporter of affordable housing, expressed frustration during the discussion of renewing the 80-10-10 scheme, which appropriates 80 percent of Community Preservation Act funds for affordable housing, 10 percent for historical preservation, and 10 percent for open space.
 
Toomey urged the Council to vote against renewing the funds, in order to force a more in-depth conversation about the program. “I’ve lost total faith in the affordable housing consortium,” he said.
 
Councillor Craig Kelley agreed with Toomey’s strong-arming strategy. “If Councillor Toomey’s frustration is that only by pulling the money away can we have an honest and painful discussion of this program, that’s the way I feel” he said. “We can’t seem to get this conversation going because every time the money comes up, it’s approved.”
 
The other councillors were less interested in continued debate on the program. The appropriation was adopted by a vote of 7-2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t take a genius to realize that when you put Bradley Cooper next to Jeremy Irons on a park bench, someone’s acting chops just aren’t going to seem up to par.  However, in the new drama “The Words,” the skill disparity between Cooper and Irons is nothing compared to that between the cast and first-time directors Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal.
In the throes of a quarter-life crisis, a struggling, New York City author named Rory Jansen (Cooper) steals another man’s work and undergoes a crisis of conscience. Jansen’s story is only one of three narratives, which involve writers’ angst, heartbreaks, and secrets. Klugman and Sternthal attempt to handle two completely unrelated themes, one about facing the consequences of immoral actions and the other about a metaphysical statement concerning the relationship between truth and fiction.  Whatever theory that emerges would have been better suited for a philosophy paper, not a motion picture drama where the potentially powerful themes are stripped of their complexity in favor of schmaltz.
In “The Words,” Jansen is joined by Clay Hammond (Dennis Quaid) and the Old Man (Irons)—three different generations yet all with the same problems. Olivia Wilde, Zoe Saldana, and Nora Arnezeder star as their respective love interests—who, sadly, play only peripheral roles in the story, leaving the three male leads to fumble with disposable material by themselves.
In a cutesy piece of narrative flair, Hammond writes a book about dastardly plagiarist Jansen, who, in a a fit of passionate desperation at not being able to buy drinks with his rich friends, stole the material for his “own” book from the Old Man. Quaid’s voice soothingly guides the audience through Jansen’s misdeed during a public reading of his book, called—you guessed it—”The Words.” With riveting lines like, “The Old Man waited in the rain,” Hammond’s storyline could have become even more of a complete bore if not for the presence of Daniella (Olivia Wilde) as a sexy grad student who bizarrely wants to seduce him.
After some necessary exposition about the crime and motive, Jansen is approached by the book’s true author, the aptly-named Old Man, and a third narrative appears, creating a Matryoshka doll script. “I just thought you should know the story behind the stories,” the Old Man teases.  And just like that, the Old Man becomes our new narrator in a meta—and metastasizing—way.
Despite the journey deeper and deeper beneath degrees of separation from the present, there’s no depth to be found emotionally in this fiasco. Unsurprisingly, Jansen recieves a lesson about how great art can only come from the pain of life experience as the Old Man bemoans a tale of lost love, failed marriage, and the death of a child. Jansen realizes the relative mildness of his own “pain,” which essentially amounted to intellectual weakness. “I’m not who I thought I was, and I’m terrified that I never will be,” he whines earlier in the film to his wife. Irons acts sad. Cooper acts chastised. Lesson learned. End Act II.
Meanwhile, Hammond explains to Daniella the “pain” behind his own identifications with his characters. “There’s no moral [to Jansen’s story besides] the belief that after making one terrible mistake, one can continue to live, and live well.” To which Daniella deeply replies, “Bullshit,” eliciting a not-so-surprising end-game confession about Hammond’s novel.
Beyond the obvious over-simplifications, the film is as cheesy stylistically as it is thematically. As narrators take us further back in time, colors become matted and the film becomes grainier in a device never before used in film. Fading match-cuts between the Jansens and the young Old Man (Ben Barnes) and his love also adds a fresh, new way of connecting two storylines across time. A melodramatic and unoriginal score filled with acoustic guitar and light piano adds to the soapy mood. Because of all of these obviously unoriginal tropes, Klugman and Sternthal’s implied theory about the uncertanity of truth in fiction is overshadowed by the saccharine style.
It’s a shame that newcomers Klugman and Sternthal were unable to discuss this issue of truth more. Despite selling a film whose premise and bill reasonably suggest a good movie, the directors’ screen-time emphasis on canned emotional responses sadly distract from any larger moral to be gained.

“Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” is a roller coaster of a film. While most thrillers simply evoke the feel of an amusement park ride, this new film, directed by “Wanted” auteur Timur Bekmambetov and appropriately produced by Tim Burton, goes one better: through its 3D effects and rapid pace, it nearly simulates one. That—along with the title—might make “Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” sound like a dumb movie, but this impression is somewhat incorrect: the film is not entirely brainless, and that is its fatal flaw. Despite its impeccable use of 3D, “Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” falters because of its awkward mix of history and escapism.
What little plot exists is encapsulated in the title. The film consists of Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) recounting his life, and while the basic details will be familiar to any student of American history—born in a log cabin, trained himself as a lawyer, became the sixteenth president of the United States—the idea that he devoted his life to the hunting of vampires will be something of a revelation to anyone that has not read Seth Grahame-Smith’s eponymous novel. Despite the inherent ridiculousness of this conceit, the major actors, especially Walker and Rufus Sewell, who plays head vampire Adam, are remarkably adept at not descending into self-parody.  As the film reaches its climax, however, the plot reaches a level of absurdism that’s difficult to transcend: it is revealed that the vampires are the leaders of the Confederacy, and that the South’s peculiar institution is a way for them to prey on helpless slaves.
This may be a convenient decision--it’s certainly more effective than having Lincoln fight both vampires and slave-owners—but it’s not an entirely satisfying one. The film is at its best before Lincoln’s ascendancy to the presidency, when history is kept at arm’s length. Reality intrudes on occasion, but only to deploy a recognizable name as a punchline. “I’m Mary.  Mary Todd,” says Lincoln’s future wife, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
But as the film progresses, the weight of history becomes inevitable. Once Lincoln becomes Commander-in-Chief, the film loses its spark. Walker, who exudes a compelling and likeable awkwardness in the earlier scenes, is nothing but stoic and grim for the final third of the film. The palette grows stiflingly somber. Worst of all, the audience is confronted by the film’s biggest problem: the incongruity between the film’s escapism and its concern with slavery.
Like Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” “Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” is a film that has grafted a B-movie conceit to a genuine historical tragedy.  Unlike Tarantino, Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have no idea what they want to do with the source material. Tarantino, for better or for worse, wanted to use the Nazis as stock villains and not deal with the true atrocities of World War II. Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith don’t lose sight of the human cost of the Civil War, but they don’t seem to realize that it’s nearly impossible to make a compelling statement about slavery when you shift the blame from people to imaginary monsters. When Lincoln’s advisers tell him of the number of soldiers killed, he simply explains how important it is to destroy slavery and the vampires.  Ultimately, the conflation of the South and the supernatural leads to a certain heavy-handedness; it consciously demonizes the Confederacy, applying a simplistic us-against-them mentality to the complex conflict of the Civil War.
All this, however, doesn’t detract from the scenes that deal exclusively with vampire hunting. There is very little of the shaky, handheld camera work that hurts most contemporary action films; rather, Bekmambetov moves his camera in a fluid and controlled manner, allowing his audience to fully appreciate the antics taking place onscreen. Perhaps the best example of this comes when Lincoln fights a vampire in the middle of a stampede. The effect isn’t disorienting or confusing; although Bekmambetov might be trying to overwhelm us, he doesn’t do it to the point where we lose a handle on the situation.  Near the end of this sequence, both Lincoln and the vampire end up jumping from horse to horse. It is an absurd image, but one that enthralls through its surprising precision and grace. There are plenty of 3D tropes in the film—bullets, characters, and fists all come flying towards the camera at one point or another—but scenes like these use the technology to give the audience a vivid understanding of how the characters move in space.
These action scenes make clear that Bekmambetov is a skilled director, but most of “Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” displays his flaws. The film, curiously enough, vastly overreaches; it cannot convincingly grapple with the question of slavery and the Civil War.  By doing so, “Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter” calls attention to how gimmicky and lightweight it is. No amount of 3D mastery can transcend that.

Liv A. Redpath ’14, an English concentrator in Pforzheimer House, is an active member of Harvard’s opera community. Redpath sits on the board of the Dunster House Opera (DHO) and is a lyric coloratura soprano. She has played many lead roles in shows at Harvard, including Rose in “Ruddigore,” Cunégonde in “Candide,” and Susanna in ”The Marriage of Figaro.” She even learned some Cyrillic for a Russian opera. Redpath shared her take on opera as a genre, the opera scene at Harvard, and DHO’s current plans for their upcoming production, “Cinderella.”
The Harvard Crimson: So how did you get involved with Opera Singing?
Liv A. Redpath:
When I was in seventh grade, my mom made me join a kids choir that was transitioning to be the children's chorus of the Minnesota Opera. I then moved up to their high school group the next year. They put on an opera each year, and when I was in eighth grade it was “Hansel and Gretel” by Engelbert Humperdinck. I auditioned and was cast as Gretel. I remember I was so nervous that the first night I got my score, I actually read through it three times! Initially I said I would do opera only for a year because I wanted to be in musical theater. However, since then I’ve changed my tune.
During my high school years, I spent most of my Saturdays with Minnesota Opera doing various training programs, main stage productions, and opera productions with their education program. I also worked at the Minnesota Opera's High School Camp this summer at a boarding school. I had been to that camp when I was in high school, and it was great to go back and be an intern and coach kids.
THC: What competitions or shows have you participated in?
LAR: In junior year of high school, I participated in the Classical Singer Magazine’s national high school competition. I got second place, which set me up well for going to college. I had done a lot of competitions in my state before, but this was the one that I felt really validated me. In freshman year of college, I did a competition called YoungArts through the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts, too. It was really fun. We flew down to Miami in January for the competition and I was a silver winner. They subsequently took us to New York later in the spring to do some outreach programs and interdisciplinary performances encompassing dance and short story writing to create a collaborative piece.
THC: Why do you like opera?
LAR: I think as an art form opera is very striking. Opera is so seamless in its format and so epic as an art form that it takes the audience out of their element in a refreshing way. It is so out of this world that it is almost more accessible because you are entering a different reality. I think you go to the opera in the hope of seeing someone that makes you excited about the performance, which is lost in a lot of other art forms. It is exciting to go and not know what you are going to get out of the performance.
THC: What is your favorite Opera?
LAR: My favorites are: “Candide” by Leonard Bernstein, “Falstaff” by Giuseppe Verdi, and “Rake’s Progress” by Igor Stravinsky.
THC: What is Dunster House Opera’s next performance?
LAR: This weekend we are in callbacks for Jules Massenet’s “Cinderella.” There will be six big female roles, and Prince Charming will even be played by a woman. There are a lot of talented women on campus and it should be really interesting.
THC: What are ways in which the current opera scene engages the students on campus?
LAR: I love the idea that [the opera scene] is all about collaboration and learning from other people. We have people in small roles who have never been in an opera before performing at Harvard. For me, it’s also really fun to hear that my friend, a senior, will try [it out]. This is the kind of outreach that should be done because once people are in an opera their perspective is totally changed on what it is to know the genre.
I love being a classical singer here at Harvard too. There aren’t a lot of us here, but it’s been a wonderful experience to work with everyone, from the people at Dunster House Opera and Gilbert and Sullivan to the Lowell House Opera. It’s been fun to work with peopleoutside Harvard as well, through Lowell House Opera--
including the up-and-coming conductors and stage directors who are further along in their training.

Is a cheating man incapable of love?  Yunior of “This Is How You Lose Her” will always cheat, but he will always love the women he cheats on. In his new book, author Junot Díaz portrays this reprehensible cheating as an impulse against which his main character constantly struggles. By building sympathy for the narrator—despite his obvious moral deficiency—Díaz encourages the reader to dig under the surface of each love story for Yunior’s basic humanity. While not as powerful or extensively detailed as his previous acclaimed novel “The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,”  Díaz’s newest piece may succeed in altering the reader’s judgement of stereotypically terrible behavior.
The narrator Yunior chronicles his past in a series of disappointing love stories, where each story inevitably ends in Yunior losing his lover due to his own faults. There’s Alma, “who has a long tender horse neck and a big Dominican ass that seems to exist in a fourth dimension beyond jeans” and Miss Lora, “always swimming underwater, the black waves of her hair flowing behind her like a school of eel.”  The way Díaz writes about Yunior’s women betrays the narrator’s deep admiration and obsession with them as well as Díaz’s own ability to create a sympathetic environment. Since women are the subject of each story, Díaz gives particular attention to the descriptions and details that set each story—and each woman—apart. This effectively shows Yunior’s surprising attachment to his various paramours. This attention comes across in one expertly crafted introduction where Díaz sets the stage for one of the sirens who will dance across the pages of his book. “I meet a Dominican from West New York. Fly, of course. Tigueña, with the most outrageous perm this side of Dykman. Lucy is her name.” By introducing Lucy’s qualities and history before her name, Díaz establishes Yunior’s constant search for the next woman “fly” enough to floor him. It’s pure impulse, and before the reader or Yunior himself has a chance to think about the moral consequences, he cheats again. Díaz thus establishes a predictable plotline in each love story.
Veteran readers of Díaz’s other novels will notice that they’ve seen this pattern, and indeed this same narrator, before: while the novel is not marketed as related to “The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” Yunior’s voice brings them together, as he also narrated “Oscar Wao.” Whereas in “Oscar Wao” Yunior acted as a passive observer, his own story is featured in “This Is How You Lose Her.” The novel thus contains a full account of sly observations and judgments of his behavior.
Some of the stories stray from Yunior’s voice to the voice of other women experiencing infidelity in their own relationships. All stories, however, are rooted in Latino immigrant culture in New York and New Jersey, and this cultural thread acts as the musical theme steadily beating through every story of a beautiful woman that Yunior cheats on. His occasional use of an arresting second person voice to address himself reprovingly is unexpectedly personal. His liberal use of the second person serves to bring the reader closer to Yunior’s story as Yunior recognizes his own emotional shortcomings.
Díaz thrives on Spanish phrases and linguistic rhythms that may be hard to understand without the help of a translator. Even a fluent Spanish speaker may not understand all of Díaz’s references, as he uses slang specific to the diaspora of Latinos living in the tri-state area. These details help ground the reader in the ethnic context of the story.  Díaz’s stories are relevant not only to the particular demographic of immigrant Dominicans in New Jersey that he writes about—in the end, the soul of his book is not the language he uses, but the women who drive Yunior’s narration and reflection. The culturally specific references end up acting not as a barrier but rather as an enhancement to the realism of the novel.
And Díaz leaves a lot of room for the reader to root for his main character. Despite his misbehavior, Yunior is not a bad guy, as he tells his readers in the first sentence of the book. By recounting Yunior’s childhood story and turbulent relationship with a cheating brother and father,  Díaz asks the reader to take a look at the whole of his character before labeling him misogynist. Díaz creates a language and a world in which it could be possible to accept cheating behavior as another facet of flawed humanity.
As always with Díaz’s writing, his new book is a quick and rhythmic read, but the sensitivity of the narrator is an attribute not to be overlooked. Creating room for redemption and sympathy is not an easy accomplishment when the main character is as promiscuous as Yunior. Díaz, however, weaves in nerdy references and such corporeal yet romantic descriptions of women that his intention as an author is clear: create a character who can be accepted and loved despite his reprehensible behavior.

“What’s nice about staying on the same pace?” sang Animal Collective vocalists Panda Bear and Avey Tare on 2009’s “Fall Be Kind” EP. This sentiment neatly sums up Animal Collective’s attitude toward their music. Over the past decade, they’ve gone from the 10-minute two-chord drones of “Sung Tongs” to the transcendent psychedelic pop of the masterpiece “Merriweather Post Pavilion” in a gradual progression that has never felt forced.
On “Centipede Hz,” their ninth studio album, the band continues this progression, with mixed results. Most of the content has already been debuted at the band’s live shows, and the album reflects this—any of these songs could easily fill a packed stadium with its sound. But what works live doesn’t always carry over to the studio well, and “Centipede Hz” crushes you like a steamroller—its density and energy leave you feeling exhausted rather than invigorated.
If there’s one thing Animal Collective does well within albums, it’s picking a sound and sticking to it. Where “Strawberry Jam” was humid and sharp-edged, and where “Merriweather” was warm and oceanic, “Centipede Hz” is raw and electric. The percussion clatters noisily, unsourceable electronic sounds drift in and out, and the vocals frequently sound like they’ve been sung through a box fan.
The sound they’ve chosen this time doesn’t lend itself well to variety, so the songs bleed together, a problem that has never plagued Animal Collective’s past releases. The arrangements are unrelenting in their volume and density—by the end of the lengthy 53-minute runtime, it’s hard to remember specific moments of the album. Where previous albums felt like the band had invited you in and showed you around their home, “Centipede Hz” feels like an unending house party—it’s fun for a bit, but soon you get tired of the sweat and movement and you just want some fresh air.
It’s possible that the band intended to overwhelm—the radio-clip transitions seem to suggest the sensory overload of the iPhone age, while the lyrics speak broadly of alienation. But if that’s the case, then they ironically fall victim to the same noisiness that they’re trying to comment on.
“Mercury Man” opens with the line, “Sounds like machines talking to me on the phone / I say but they don’t quite get me”—a powerful sentiment that nonetheless gets lost under layers of chaotic drums and washy synths. A similar fate befalls “New Town Burnout,” whose punchy organ and staccato vocals start off promisingly but soon reveal that they haven’t left themselves anywhere to go.
The lyrics on “Centipede Hz” are some of the best they’ve penned—few bands can write about subjects as pedestrian as cars and hiking trips with Animal Collective’s earnest, wild-eyed fascination. But each song is so tightly packed with words that few of the lines have much chance to sink in—and besides, they generally get swallowed in the mix anyway.
Even though the album as a whole falls short of past releases, the fact that “Centipede Hz” still has some great tracks is a testament to the band’s creative ability. “Today’s Supernatural,” the album’s first single, is a proper banger, on par with “My Girls” from “Merriweather” or “For Reverend Green” from “Strawberry Jam” in energy and accessibility. However, it’s darker and more aggressive than either of those songs, finishing with a throat-rending Avey scream over a spectacular aural plane crash.
Guitarist Deakin makes his vocal debut on “Wide Eyed,” another standout track. His voice is more casual than either Panda’s or Avey’s, but it is strong in its own right, and it works well with unassuming lyrics about pregnancy and fatherhood.
After the towering heights AnCo reached with 2009’s “Merriweather”—widely hailed as one of the best albums of the last decade—they could have done one of two things. They could have made Merriweather 2.0, tempting but uninteresting. Or they could have taken a left turn and veered into unknown territory. They chose the latter, and while the results are somewhat disappointing, at least they’ve chosen motion over stagnancy.

“Circa 1963” in the Sert Gallery of the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts is a flashback to the time when architect Le Corbusier’s only building in the United States was a modern marvel. The exhibition showcases pieces from the early 1960s when the building first opened in the ‘60s. To some of us, the Carpenter Center might just be a concrete building across from Lamont, but its architectural and historical story has earned it a year of celebration leading up to the building’s 50th anniversary in May of 2013.
Wandering up the long ramp to the Sert Gallery, it is easy to see why the Carpenter Center is unique. The structure was built with the intention of being used as an art-making space and was designed in such a way that, because of the different entrances, rounded concrete, and large windows, a viewer can see the many studio spaces that the building has to offer of where he or she is.
“[Le Corbusier] was so excited that he was making an arts building that should inspire creative practice in use,” said David Rodowick, Director of the Carpenter Center and Department Head of Visual and Environmental Studies.  The prospect of a building totally devoted to the arts was also exciting for Nathan Marsh Pusey, the president of Harvard at the time of construction.
“President Pusey wanted to make a big splash,” said Rodowick. He began working with Josep Lluis Sert, a Spanish architect who was then Dean of the Graduate School of Design. “Sert said that Le Corbusier is it. He lobbied for the building because he was friends with Le Corbusier, who was then at the end of his career and his life,” said Rodowick. With a generous gift from the Carpenter family, plans were set in place for the building, and in 1960 Le Corbusier came to America to present his model.
“There was certainly a big controversy about having this modernist icon amongst the [Harvard] Faculty Club and the red bricks,” said Rodowick. “[Le Corbusier] knew that this would be his only major building in North America, so he was essentially given carte blanche.” The Carpenter Center’s architecture is not the only feature that separates it from the traditional buildings in Harvard Square. “The building is special not only because it is unique but because it is an art building,” said Rodowick. “It was meant to be an artistic capstone to his career.”
“Le Corbusier wanted to make a restatement of basic architectural ideas… all elements in the building are drawn from other innovations of his. There is a flow of air, light, and movement throughout the building, which makes all different practices intersect.”
This cohesion is also found in the exhibition, “Circa 1963.” Moving into the installation room, one can’t help but notice how the pieces themselves engage in an artistic dialogue. The exhibition boasts an eclectic mix of pieces that at first glance seem to conflict with each other. For example, a large George Sugarman sculpture in the middle of the room stands in stark contrast to the Yoko Ono found-objects piece. This difference in artistic mediums and themes is one of the more important aspects of the collection. “There is a unity in design, in experimentation. There is the question of, ‘What is a medium?’ This is very prevalent today,” Rodowick said.
Choosing the pieces for the show was no easy task. Rodowick, the driving force behind “Circa,” gave himself the boundaries of finding pieces from between the years 1960 to 1965, the time period surrounding the opening of the Carpenter Center in 1963. Rodowick tried to select a wide variety of pieces that would work well in conjuction with each other. The selected pieces were originally located at the Fogg Collection and the Addison Gallery of American Art of Phillips Academy.
According to Rodowick, public reception of “Circa 1963” has been positive so far. “The exhibit’s only been open a week but there’s already been a lot of traffic,” Rodowick said. Pedra Hodgson, architectural critic at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, happened to stumble across the exhibition while exploring the building itself, specifically some “old friends,” (like a couple of Aaron Siskind photo prints). She thought that the pieces in “Circa 1963” seemed to work suitably together and were representative of the time period. “The pluralism and different ways of expression at the time are shown here, what with the straightforward abstract [pieces] but also in the paintings.”
Ultimately, the Carpenter Center and “Circa” bring togehter different works of art to emphasize the historic importance of the building and the ways in which it continues to remain relevant. According to Rodowick, Le Corbusier always said that his buildings  should bring together head and heart. The Carpenter Center aims to fulfill the vision of its creator through its programming during this anniversary year of its completion and the continued devotion to the art community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some novelists attempt to make sense of the world through their books, but in his debut novel, T.M. Wolf ’05 instead gives voice to the world’s confusion—he structures the very words on his pages to reflect the unpredictability of life. Wolf’s unique writing style sets a background of sound for the novel by structuring the pages to resemble music—sometimes the words look like notes on staff paper, for example, and sometimes like lyrics in a notebook. The entire novel is filled with artistic renderings of the words in the book. While these unconventional additions can be distracting, “Sound” is nevertheless an oft-emotional and descriptive debut.
Much of the book is even written using lines of words to create the illusion of a vinyl record. To cue a turning point in the narrative, black blots resembling scratches on a vinyl record litter the end. This use of visuals adds to the “sound” of the story; like the real world, dialogue is rarely as simple as two people exchanging words. In the novel, a baseball game, the radio in the car, and an argument at a table by the window offer some of the audio distractions. Following this story requires filtering out all the “noise” and instead listening to the core of the tale—in essence, its melody. Noise, in “Sound,” takes the form of changing fonts, sizes, and placement. The point of view also jumps every few paragraphs. From time to time, Wolf will throw in a “woop woop,” “knock knock,” or some other onomatopoeia to illustrate background noise. Wolf’s attention to this sense adds an extra dimension that brings “Sound” close to a multimedia form. Wolf even includes a link to mix tapes and songs that inspired the book, and his knowledge and care for music reveals itself in song lyrics every time a character is within earshot of a stereo, phonograph, or radio.
Beyond its unusual style, though, “Sound” is a fairly standard coming-of-age story set on the Jersey Shore. The philosophizing protagonist Cincy is constantly surprised by the world around him—he is both blind and aware. He barely notices the drug ring around him, yet a few lyrics launch him into reverie on the meaning of life. Though confusing at first, this style suits the musings of a man who is on a pause from academia and discovers that “the market for my eighteen-year-old self in Jersey was better than the market for my twenty-four-year-old self anywhere else”. The way Wolf writes his jumbled thoughts out of order, cut and spliced, represents post-college uncertainty better than any long-winded treatise.
Unfortunately, Wolf seemed to pour all of his authorial effort into Cincy. Other characters are merely caricatures; they float in and out of Cincy’s philosophical stream of consciousness. Vera, the dreamy girl from Cincy’s youth, is a vision of beauty and perfection. She works at a homeless shelter and is the focus of all men’s attentions. At his workplace, Cincy banters with a friendly-uncle type, a stoner teen, and a savvy, skillful blue-collar worker.  He lives with a deadbeat friend, and his supportive parents show up only through phone calls and expectations. The police are brutal and suspicious, and a privileged kid is selling drugs. Instead of using these stock characters to frame Cincy’s inner dialogue, Wolf simply adds them as filler material.
Though some of his characters may be standard, Wolf’s descriptions of the Shore are anything but. Though “Sound” tries to bring a soundscape into the novel, its strongest feature is its physical setting. Though known by much of the world only as the setting of the MTV show, the Shore in summer is, for Wolf, the perfect place to set his confused protagonist and the past that he wants to remember. For Cincy, the wandering 20-something, the Shore in summer represents the carelessness of his past and a temporary respite from his academic work. Wolf clearly knows this place intimately and describes it lovingly, carefully, and thoroughly. From “the old-money Cape Cods that lined the western side of Ocean” to “the docks and bulkheads washed daily by the freshwater that flowed seaward from the Manasquan and Metedeconk Rivers,” Wolf paints a visual landscape that provides an anchor for the rest of the story.
The steady landscape is necessary, because the story is often dominated by the sound elements. Dialogue is so jarringly separated or mixed that multiple characters seem to melt into one giant voice speaking in Cincy’s head.  Repeated phrases, instead of being emphasized, become redundant. All capitals, shapes, and misspellings for visual effect are used so often that much of the book’s page count is dominated by giant letterings of “COPS” or “Get em up now HIGH”. Lettering font and size seem not to be dictated by any sort of order, as volume, importance, and character shift from variation to variation.
Unfortunately, the confusion dominates the book instead of enlightening any inner struggle. Though Cincy “started listening tomusic the way [he] did—incessantly and immersively… [because] the music was space-filling,” the book takes that idea to its logical conclusion and fills the space with written sound. Unorganized, constant sound becomes noise, but “Sound” needs moments of silence to create written music.

Dirty Projectors are an art-rock band that has consistently gravitated more towards art than rock. On 2007’s “Rise Above,” the band recreated Black Flag’s “Damaged” entirely from memory, reaching almost performance-art levels of gimmickry. And their 2009 breakthrough, “Bitte Orca,” was just as much a piece of artwork—an iridescent, shimmering sonic painting—as it was an indie rock album.
However, on “Swing Lo Magellan,” their sixth studio album, Dirty Projectors head in the opposite direction. The album sounds less like a work of art and more like a collection of songs, and as it turns out, that shift suits the Dirty Projectors just fine. “Swing Lo Magellan” is Dirty Projector’s most accessible album yet, and they’ve sacrificed none of the thoughtful weirdness that characterized their previous releases.
Bandleader Dave Longstreth reveals himself on this album as a singer-songwriter who revels in constructing perfectly likeable rock songs and then pulling the legs out from under them. “Dance For You,” the album’s sixth track, opens with simple handclaps over a swooning guitar line and contains some of Longstreth’s most straightforward and accessible lyrics to date: “There is an answer / I haven’t found it, but I will keep dancing ’til I do.” The song continues rather uneventfully until about halfway through, when an orchestra suddenly forces its way through the snares and guitar, punching an atonal hole in the song’s otherwise simple harmonies and crescendoing to an almost unbearable volume before vanishing into thin air. The handclaps and guitar return as if nothing ever happened.
This kind of playful destructiveness could easily come across as annoying, unnecessary, and self-indulgent, but Dirty Projectors toe the line expertly. On “Unto Caesar,” as Longstreth’s lyrics get progressively more oblique (“Down the line, down the mercenary Barbary / Down the line, down the martyrs’ morbid poetry”), vocalist Amber Coffman breaks the fourth wall and says, “Uh, that doesn’t make any sense, what you just said.” For Dirty Projectors’ detractors, this aside is just more of Longstreth’s insufferable pretension. But considering the band’s shift towards a more immediate sound, this aside comes across as a humorous bit of self-effacement—necessary, even, considering the band’s sometimes knotty reputation.
Elsewhere on the album, wobbly arrangements couple with straightforward yet compelling lyrics, to create songs that take multiple listens to reveal their layers. Coffman’s solo feature “The Socialites” opens with a lopsided kick drum and an agile guitar riff. The lyrics play like an internal dialogue. She starts by fawning over the glitterati with lines like, “I think she’s the prettiest lady I’ve ever seen / Her hair, it has meaning and volume and such a sheen.” But by the end of the song, she’s repulsed by their emptiness: “I’m glad they’re the ones on the other side of the glass / Who knows what my spirit is worth in cold, hard cash?”
There isn’t a track on the album that gets stale. “About to Die” tells a Tolstoyan tale of mortality and depression; Coffman and vocalist Haley Dekle parrot Longstreth’s lines, serving as the Greek muses to his tragic hero. It’s all very sophisticated, but it’ll also be stuck in your head for days. “See What She Seeing” has a seasick-stumble guitar riff and spasmodic percussion reminiscent of clattering rocks, but its lyrics are those of a simple love song.
The highlight of the album is “Gun Has No Trigger,” perhaps the best song the band has ever produced. Longstreth’s lyrics, which address from a modern perspective the complex horrors of conformity and suicide, are difficult but compelling. Coffman and Dekle’s oohs float over the drumbeat like ominous ghosts. The tense verses would lend themselves well to an explosive chorus, but instead all Coffman and Dekle provide is a burst of harmony and throbbing bass. It’s a claustrophobic, tightly wound, thoroughly enjoyable three minutes.
The line between tunefulness and experimentation is a treacherous tightrope for any band to walk. With “Swing Lo Magellan,” Dirty Projectors prove that it’s possible to go from an obscure art-rock outfit to one of the indie rock world’s premiere acts without compromising the things that keep them interesting. For a band who delight in knocking things off-balance, Dirty Projectors walk the tightrope astonishingly well.

Fiona Apple’s “The Idler Wheel...” is not a sing-along album. Her piano chords are full of dissonance, her melodies are rhythmically off-beat and staggered, and her intonation is wholly unexpected. It is clear that Apple has come a long way musically from the brash ’90s earworm “Criminal” that kicked off her career. Fifteen years later, Apple has ditched her bluesy, alternative rock and developed a grittier, discordant palette. With its unique instrumentation and spirited, self-reflecting lyrics, “The Idler Wheel” signals a more experimental and darker stage in Apple’s musical development.
The album’s seriousness is evident from the fact that every song is in a minor key. Apple not only acknowledges the emotional darkness, but embraces it: “Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key,” she sings in “Werewolf.” The music is not supposed to be easygoing and upbeat; rather, through this album Apple seems come to terms with a glum state of mind, alleviating it with bursts of energetic trebles and positivity that create a breathtaking, frantic, and constantly shifting whole.
This state of mind can be seen in the lead single, “Every Single Night,” a welcome return for the long-inactive artist. The juxtaposition of playful chimes and Apple’s powerful, earthy vocals creates a dream-like sound that is all at once eerie and infectiously quirky. The simplicity of the chimes and minor piano chords allows for the artist’s throaty voice to dominate the recording.
Apple’s vocals lend power to the emotional, turbulent lyrics on the “The Idler Wheel...” While Apple mastered the love song on previous projects, her lyrics on the new album focus more on her quest to abate her inner turmoil. “Now I’m hard, too hard to know / I don’t cry when I’m sad anymore, no no,” sings Apple in “Left Alone.” “Tears calcify in my tummy / Fears coincide with tow.” The lyrics allude to a newfound strength that is reflected in the sinewy roughness of the instrumentation.
Apple sounds fierce even on the album’s only love song, “Anything We Want.” The song mixes Apple’s distinct wail with light percussion and heavy piano chords, and its raw passion makes it the climax of the album. “We try not to let those bastards get us down / We don’t worry anymore cause we know when the guff comes we get brave,” she sings. This statement of purpose emerges from the cacophony of rumbling snare drums to coalesce into a powerful chorus that reveals Apple’s impressive command over her music.
The biting power that is manifested in “Anything We Want” winds down into “Hot Knife,” the final track of the album. The shift into “Hot Knife” is a refreshing one—whereas Apple’s work in the first nine tracks of the album is heavy and slightly cold with melancholy, the final song is lighter and hot with innuendo. Performed as a duet between Apple and her sister Maude Maggart, “Hot Knife” is foot-tapping perfection in canon-like harmony. Apple’s exclamatory solos frequently cut through the ethereal, multi-layered chorus, providing an interesting dialogue between sensual and sharp vocals.
Despite the soothing mellowness of “Hot Knife,” “The Idler Wheel” is ultimately characterized by an untamed ferocity. “I may need a chaperone,” Apple states in “Daredevil.”  She seems conscious of the fact that her music is challenging and alienating, yet she refuses to compromise with her artistic vision.

Kimberly A. Pacelli, a former director of residential life at Bowdoin College and graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, officially assumed her new position as associate dean of student life on Monday.
Pacelli fills the vacancy left open by Joshua G. McIntosh, the former associate dean of student life who is now serving as the dean of academic services at Johns Hopkins University.
Until August, McIntosh had also temporarily led the Office of Student Life after former Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson’s June departure for Colgate University.
Pacelli was not available for comment Monday.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced Pacelli’s appointment as associate dean in an Aug. 16 email to colleagues. Hammonds wrote that she was delighted that Pacelli would be joining the College community and asked that her colleagues join her in welcoming the new dean to the College.
Before becoming associate dean, Pacelli was a practicing attorney at Drummond Woodsum in Portland, Maine after leaving her position at Bowdoin in 2008 to attend law school at the University of Maine Law School.
Pacelli served as the assistant director of residential life for two years at Bowdoin before leaving to pursue her masters in education at Harvard and later working at the Department of Education in Washington D.C, according to The Bowdoin Orient, the campus newspaper. She returned to the College in 2004 as Director of Residential Life.
As Director of Residential Life, Pacelli continued work that she began as an undergraduate in Bowdoin’s class of 1998. While in her junior year, Pacelli served as one of three students on a commission to help phase out the fraternity system and establish the College House system, according to The Orient.
In addition to overseeing a staff of 70 students and managing programming and events at the office, Pacelli focused on developing the Bowdoin House system and the Office of Residential Life, Associate Director of Housing Operations Lisa Rendall said.
According to Rendall, Pacelli also developed strong relationships with students, who would often come into her office, whether it was to play trivia or the game Boggle or discuss politics.
“She is a political junkie and is more than happy to talk about elections and the Constitution with anyone who is interested,” Rendell said.
In an email to the Undergraduate Council Monday morning, UC President Danny P. Bicknell ‘13 welcomed Pacelli to her new position.
Bicknell said that he hopes continues McIntosh’s work on student organization funding, a top priority last semester. Bicknell added that he is excited what Pacelli will bring to the position of associate dean of student life, especially given safety and academic integrity concerns at the College and the ongoing search for a dean of student life.
“This will definitely be helpful to students to have another dean other than two vacant spots,” said Bicknell.
The position of dean of student life has yet to be filled. A job posting for the position appeared on The Chronicle of Higher Education last month.

UPDATED: Sept. 11, 2012, at 12:16 p.m.
Economics professor Eric S. Maskin ’72, who won a Nobel Prize in 2007 for his contributions to the field of game theory, has been appointed a University Professor, joining 22 other faculty members who hold Harvard’s most prestigious post.
Maskin, who will serve as the Adams University Professor, said that he was “thrilled” and “honored” to earn the position. Though he concentrated in mathematics as an undergraduate, Maskin is most celebrated for his research in informational economics and mechanism design theory.
Maskin began his academic career at M.I.T. before coming to Harvard in 1985. He left Harvard in 2000 to research at the Institute for Advanced Study, an academic center that has attracted great minds such as Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer.
In 2012, Maskin rejoined the economics department at Harvard.
“The opportunity to attract back a faculty member this distinguished was irresistible to the Dean,” said economics professor John Y. Campbell, who chaired the department when Maskin returned. “He is not only an outstanding researcher but also an outstanding citizen of the university.”
As a University Professor, Maskin can now engage in interdisciplinary research at any of Harvard’s schools.
“I’ll have the freedom to teach not just in the economics department, but outside,” he said. “Given my interests, that’s very appealing.”
Maskin’s research intersects with several diverse fields, including political science, law, biology, and psychology, among others.
“I like to work on a number of things simultaneously,” he said. “If you're working on a variety of projects and if you get stuck on one of them you can move to another without grinding your gears indefinitely.”
In addition, the New Jersey native said that he hopes to design and co-teach an “interesting interdisciplinary course” with another professor at Harvard and pursue his current interests in voting schemes, income inequality, intellectual property rights, and other issues.
Already, Maskin has begun researching and teaching with a variety of other professors.
Many professors are eager to collaborate with Maskin.
Longtime colleague and mathematics professor Benedict H. Gross ’71, who was unable to be reached by phone, wrote in an emailed statement that he has already proposed that Maskin teach a course in the math department.
This fall, Maskin and fellow University Professor Amartya Sen are co-teaching Economics 2082: “Social Choice Theory.”
Sen, who said he was on his way to discuss course readings with Maskin over lunch following the interview, reflected on his colleague’s strength in both research and teaching.
“Eric Maskin is a stunning economist,” Sen said. “He’s an absolutely wonderful person to teach a joint class with.”

Sparks House—historic landmark and former private residence to the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes—has undergone a color change. Recently a bright shade of canary yellow, the House has now been painted a taupe tone, restoring the house to its original color that dates back over 150 years.
Officially labeled the Treadwell-Sparks House, the House was built in 1838 to serve as the residence for Harvard Professor Daniel Treadwell and later for former University President Jared Sparks, a member of the Class of 1815.
The New Church Theological School purchased the House from Harvard in the late nineteenth century to serve as a training center for Swedenborgian ministers—a religious sect that follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg.
In the 1960s, Harvard re-acquired the property and moved the House from its former location at 48 Quincy Street to its current site at 21 Kirkland Street in order to make room for the building of the Graduate School of Design.
Added to the National Historic Register in 1986, the House served for more than 35 years as the home of the late Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes who began the tradition of serving Wednesday tea in the House. After moving into the house in the early 1970s, Gomes chose the canary yellow that had marked the house since that time, according to Cambridge Historical Commission Survey Director Susan E. Maycock.
Harvard officials consulted the Cambridge Historical Commission after deciding to repaint the House in its original color scheme.
Maycock provided the paint consultation to the University, advising that a test be performed to determine exactly which shade first adorned Sparks House.
“We recommended that Harvard do a paint analysis—which was done several years ago—to determine what the original paint color was,” she said. “We’re obviously very pleased that they were interested in repainting close to its original scheme.”
Madeline C. McMahon ’14, a student who passes the building often on her way to class, noted that the new shade of the building better matches the buildings that flank it.
“Although I can’t say I paid particularly close attention to its color beforehand, I find the new shade to be much more relevant to its current surroundings,” she said.

The Crimson Coalition, a newly formed group that aims to reform the Undergraduate Council by gaining a majority of seats in the next election, held its first meeting Sunday night to bring together student voices as the group shapes its agenda.
The group of approximately 30 students shared its frustrations with the structure of the current UC and proposed ideas to increase the power of student government on campus, according to students who attended the meeting.
“One of our main goals is to build greater student power on campus,” said Samuel F. Wohns ’14, one of the Crimson Coalition’s lead organizers and a Crimson Magazine editor. “We see the Crimson Coalition as a way to build student power and re-invigorate student government.”
Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14, another lead organizer, said the coalition plans on fighting for “process changes”  including the establishment of a new ballot referendum process through which students could voice their concerns.
Biblarz said he hopes such reforms might get student government involved in larger, University-wide issues like keeping Lamont open on weekends, discussing Harvard’s role in the greater community, and considering Harvard’s endowment practices.
The Coalition is currently working on drafting a platform and revising its soon-to-be-released vision statement, according to Wohns and Biblarz.
“We are looking for students who are interested in tackling a range of student issues that are campus-wide and at times political and controversial,” Biblarz said.
In an email to prospective members of the coalition before the meeting, Biblarz and Wohns warned that more aggressive actions could be taken should the coalition fail to achieve adequate reform.
“We’re going all out and all in–if we don’t seriously change the way student government does business by the end of the year, we’ll advocate for the dissolution of the UC and the creation of an alternative form of student government,” read the e-mail.
Several students who attended the meeting, including Cheng Li ’14, said they felt the coalition might fight for student voices that are often ignored.
“I think the Crimson Coalition gives me a chance to re-envision what a student government could be,” said Li. “I entered the school thinking UC members are only there to help us with little things like shuttles. I never even questioned, what else could there be?”
Sarah R. Siskind '14 said she entered the meeting curious as to what a more active UC might look like, but  left concerned by what she perceived to be the partisan nature of the Crimson Coalition.
“In full disclosure, I feel a little disappointed,” Siskind said. “It’s clear that they have a progressivist agenda, but they don’t want to fully concede to that. I think it would be to their benefit to run as a partisan group.”
Siskind also worried that the Crimson Coalition will find it difficult to implement their reforms.“There is no leverage to any of the policies they wanted,” she said.
Wohns rejected the idea that the coalition plans on taking political stances on specific policies.
“I think it’s important to clarify what we mean by politics. We are not talking about a UC that’s weighing in on national political issues or aligns itself with a political party or political ideology,” Wohns said.
Current UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 attended Sunday’s meeting.
“It was encouraging to see student interested in running for the Council,” wrote in an e-mail to the Crimson because he could not be reached by phone. “The Council needs passionate and dedicated Representatives that will fight for the students’ interests.”
Bicknell also said that the current UC will “continue to fight for student power.”
According to the Crimson Coalition’s organizers, Sunday’s meeting was not the public launch. The next meeting of the Crimson Coalition will be on Thursday night at 10:00 p.m. in the Quincy Spindell Room.

It has been less than one week since former President Bill Clinton took the stage at the Democratic National Convention, but his performance has already secured its place as one of the most policy-oriented—and likely most effective—political speeches in recent memory. His highly improvised delivery instantaneously garnered the praise of pundits and fact-checkers alike, as his deft command of statistics and policy specifics shone in stark contrast with the less intellectually honest performances of the campaign season.
Clinton’s greatest talent, his ability to break down and explain complex issues, is sorely missing from our political discourse. When politicians are not engaging in outright dissimulation, they often spout platitudes so vague as to engender no conceivable controversy. Clinton, by contrast, broke down such issues as healthcare, employment, and student loans in detailed and comprehensible language. In the words of David Brooks, he “devastatingly fill[ed]” the “policy vacuum” left by the Romney campaign.
In the days since Clinton’s speech, Obama has received a post-convention “bounce,” which is likely at least partially due to Clinton’s performance. Other politicians ought to take this as a sign that political success need not be the mere product of avoiding specifics sufficiently (or fabricating them) and hoping that the electorate likes you more than the other candidate. Indeed, Clinton has shown that a politician can get wonky and honest without losing the attention of the audience. Indeed, for all its statistics, Clinton’s speech was nevertheless moving.
The rest of the political world is taking notice, as well. In the days since Clinton’s speech, President Obama has joked that Clinton ought to be appointed the “secretary of explaining stuff,” and even candidate Mitt Romney has acknowledged that Clinton “elevate[d]” the DNC. Unfortunately, such statements aren’t a binding promise to elevate the level of our discourse. Indeed, politicians will only react to changes in the electorate’s preference. Only when voters reward intellectually honest and policy-oriented politicians at the ballot box will candidates cease the endless parade of platitudes in favor of something more substantial.
While an avoidance of issues in favor of fluff is nothing new in politics—indeed a Jefferson surrogate once accused John Adams of having a “hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman”—this campaign season has led some commentators to label it “policy-free.”
Clinton’s approach is exemplary of the kind of honesty that our discourse needs. This is not the phony moderation adopted by so many pundits who crave a veneer of credibility at the expense of factual accuracy, but rather a robust, honest, and, yes, political defense of his party’s vision for America.  We just wish there could be more of it.

Its titular appositive is “the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit” and its mission statement says it exists “to empower and engage people around the world to collect and develop educational content under a free license or in the public domain, and to disseminate it effectively and globally.” The plea for donations on the Wikimedia’s Foundation’s homepage implores potential givers to “Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of human knowledge.”
But, what is Wikipedia? To most, this question seems unnecessarily pedantic. After all, everybody knows what Wikipedia is. It is the sixth most visited website in the world and has become the starting point for all general knowledge, a fact the academic world will have to contend with in the near future.
While Wikipedia’s role in the improvement or degradation of academic knowledge is certainly worth considering, that is not the topic about the encyclopedic service that has occupied my mind of late. Rather, my train of thought has revolved around what the Wikipedia community and its quasi-tribal rule of law will allow as contributions to the “sum of human knowledge.”
About a month ago, online conservatives and liberals fought a turf war over the Republican vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan. The battle was fought in the domain of Ryan’s high school years, when he was, at various times, labeled “biggest ‘brown noser’” and “prom king.” Each sobriquet was removed, reinstated, re-removed, and so forth. At the end of the day, the conservatives won out, with “prom king” surviving the carnage evident on the “talk page.
The Great Paul Ryan War of 2012 did not slow down in September, however, as competing edits raised the stakes to whether the nominee’s RNC acceptance speech contained factual inaccuracies.  At some point, an armistice was reached, as the white flag on the top of the page boldly declares: “This page is currently protected from editing until disputes have been resolved.” The treaty does not signal the fighting’s end, as the banner also directs interested parties to “discuss any changes on the talk page” and makes sure to note that the “protection is not an endorsement of the current version” (which does not mention controversy over the speech’s veracity).
At first glance, this does not seem too portentous. This election has important issues, like invisible presidents in visible chairs and acutely meditated party platforms, to grapple with. But like Twitter and, at least for President Obama, Reddit, Wikipedia has become a legitimate political battleground. Wikipedia is the first destination for any inquiring mind, and opponents have every incentive to control what a voter sees when researching a potentially contentious topic. This is similar to earned media strategies of getting favorable op-eds placed in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, although, if the bloodshed in the Paul Ryan field is any indication, much more vicious. The “sum of human knowledge,” as it turns out, is required to take up only a limited amount of space.
Edit wars, as—according to a Wikipedia page on the very topic—the feuds are officially called, ensnare more than just political victims. Recently, prize-winning author Philip Roth entered the fray, when he petitioned the keepers of his page to change the story of his inspiration for the novel “The Human Strain” to one that was, well, actually true. Roth was not arguing that his piece should be interpreted a specific way but simply wanted to accurately equip human knowledge with the truth about the book’s origin. Much to his dismay, his request for modification to the page was denied. His request was rejected with the following retort from the Wikipedia administrator: “I understand your point that the author is the greatest authority on their own work but we require secondary sources.” Roth resorted to penning an open letter about his predicament in the New Yorker, which ended his traumatic experience with a powerful institution—an institution that somehow found itself with the legitimate authority to promulgate an inaccurate story about the goings-on of Roth’s mind.
The frightening part is that we are the ones who bestowed this authority upon Wikipedia. We entered dangerous terrain by relying on Wikipedia for information in its infant years, but refrains to beware its dubious encyclopedic values eventually led to dramatically strengthened standards. For the most part, we have ditched skepticism and now rely wholly on Wikipedia’s truthfulness. Yet, just because we believe everything on the site, does not mean we should forget what it really is. Everyone may contribute, but someone controls what contributions remain. Some topics are off the table entirely.  Apparently I missed it, but at some point, we ceded control over what we allow ourselves to know.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early 1987, Derek C. Bok, then in his second decade as President of Harvard, took a three-month sabbatical, visiting Spain, Israel, and India. While in India, then under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Bok was offered a significant donation by the Indian government. He refused, on the principle that a university as wealthy as Harvard could not accept money from a country—then, as now—unable to adequately meet the needs of its own citizens. It seemed clear that Indian money was more urgently needed in India.
I heard this story from Nathan Glazer, professor emeritus of sociology and education, who was struck by the contrast between Bok’s attitude and that of his successors. In the past two years, Harvard has received three massive endowments—even by the standards of this university—from Indian donors. N.R. Narayana Murthy, founder of the software giant Infosys, gave over $5 million to create the Murthy Classical Library of India, a sort of Asian equivalent to the Loeb. Anand G. Mahindra ’77, who heads an industrial group, gave $10 million to what is now the Mahindra Humanities Center. And towering above them all was Ratan Tata, whose gift of $50 million to Harvard Business School dwarfs the entire endowment of many colleges and universities.
To be sure, private charity is to be distinguished from taxpayer money, but this large influx of funds from what is, by most standards, a poor country, ought to give us pause. At the very least, it should­ prompt careful reflection and serious debate on what Harvard’s relationship to a country like India ought to be. Given the wealth of industrialists such as the aforementioned troika, should Harvard see India as a largely untapped opportunity, a source of billions of potential dollars? Or should Harvard seek to employ its considerable influence and expertise in the service of India’s development?
In either case, the principle underlying President Bok’s refusal remains valid a quarter-century later. Indians who are bullish about the country’s prospects tend to compare the state of the nation to the United States during the Gilded Age, where great fortunes are being made in an atmosphere of poor regulation, corruption and crony capitalism. But political reforms will follow economic growth, or so the story goes. The key difference is that while the robber barons of late 19th century United States created lasting institutions (Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Chicago) with their wealth, India’s new billionaires are noticeable, with only a handful of exceptions, for their aversion to private charity. The fact that Harvard accepted $60 million from Indian businessmen in the space of a few months is jarring when one considers how much further that money would have gone in India. Surely it is reasonable to expect Harvard, a nonprofit institution with a public-good purpose, to consider this.
To be fair to two of the three donors in question, Murthy has a highly creditable track record of charitable giving in India, and his donation to Harvard serves the cause of Indian classical letters in general, rather than merely that of an American university. Mahindra is an alumnus of the college (where he concentrated in Visual and Environmental Studies) and his gift goes to the humanities at a time when they struggle to find funding at universities across the country. Tata’s donation, however, is difficult if not impossible to justify. Unlike Sanskrit letters or the humanities, the business school (of which Ratan Tata is a graduate) is hardly a cause in desperate need of funding. $50 million, moreover, could fund a full-fledged private university or college in India, where the supply for higher education is utterly unable to keep up with demand.
Perhaps it may be deemed foolish or naïve to ask that Harvard, particularly in light of the 2008 financial crisis, reject a donation such as Mr. Tata’s. At the same time, serious reflection might reveal to Harvard’s leadership that soliciting donations from rich Indians sends all the wrong messages, and is arguably counter to the guiding principles of the university itself. Harvard remains by some distance the world’s richest university.
President Bok returned from the 1987 trip firmly committed to making Harvard a more global university. This commitment has, unquestionably, also motivated his three successors. But Harvard’s unparalleled global brand needs to be matched by a more global sense of purpose. Institutions like Harvard, Yale or Cornell, all of whom have received tens of millions in Indian funding in the past four years, would achieve more by contributing to improvements in India’s higher education than by adding zeroes to their endowment through Indian donations. The next time President Drew G. Faust or Provost Alan M. Garber receive a phone call from an Indian billionaire, they should advise him to send his money where it will have the greatest impact.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second week of August, as I entered the gurdwara in Richmond Hill, NY, I encountered a scene of solidarity unlike any that I had witnessed before. Two uniformed NYPD officers were stationed outside, monitoring the entrance. A third was patrolling the hallway inside, smiling as community members insisted he join them in the community kitchen downstairs for a hot meal of lentils, vegetables, and yogurt after his shift. The diligence with which law enforcement officials have responded to the Oak Creek tragedy and the sacrifices made by the police on the scene—along with the outpouring of support from the public—have been humbling and heartwarming.
Physical protection and public outcry, however, are not enough to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The attack this week matches a broader pattern of post-9/11 bias in our country. Violent hate crimes—such as the murder of two Sikhs in California earlier this year and the fire bombing of a Sikh-owned convenience store in Virginia last year—continue to occur regularly. According to a survey conducted by the Sikh Coalition, three out of five Sikh children with headwear say have been physically assaulted in school. Employment discrimination still forces Sikhs to choose between their articles of faith and their livelihoods.  Since 9/11, the Sikh Coalition has documented thousands of such bias incidents in the US.
Sikh Americans are certainly not alone in these experiences. Organizations working with other religious groups, such as Muslims and Hindus, have documented incidents that stem from the same source: racism and xenophobia.
Ultimately, the only way to prevent further violence is to eliminate the hate that fuels it, and this responsibility is far beyond the purview of law enforcement. It lies with our policymakers, schools, local communities, and families. The most essential step is education—to dispel the ignorance and stigma that surrounds religious minorities.
It also requires a conscious commitment by policymakers to not ostracize and exclude minorities in daily life. As a general rule, Sikhs are still not allowed to serve in the US military or the NYPD with their turbans—as they do with pride in all levels of law enforcement in Canada and the UK. A reversal of this policy would be a powerful visual reminder that the public can trust Sikhs to help keep us safe. As a turbaned woman, each time I fly, I am pulled aside for a secondary screening of my one-inch thick headwear. I am instructed to wait shoeless in a clear plastic bullpen for a “female assist”—while women with billowing summer skirts sail through security in front of me. A screening policy based on assessment of actual risk would not only be more effective, it would prevent minorities from being publicly humiliated and cast as de facto suspects.
In the aftermath of last month’s tragedy, Americans of all faiths will mourn together, express solidarity for each other, and address the immediate crime.  But if we move forward without a commitment to make real change, we will have failed the victims of Oak Creek. We will have failed each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a report circulated over the past few days claiming that Harvard had devised a tiered punishment scheme to uniformly sanction any students found guilty of cheating in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” a Harvard spokesperson reaffirmed the College’s statement that it will resolve each case in the sweeping plagiarism investigation on an individual basis.
On Sunday, IvyGate, a blog that covers news and gossip from the eight Ivy League universities, published the contents of an email from “a tipster” claiming to know how the Administrative Board will issue decisions to students in the scandal.
Citing his or her resident dean, the tipster identified four ways the Ad Board would proceed in specific circumstances—ranging from possible exoneration for students whose similar answers resulted from notes or study guides shared before the exam came out, to a failing course grade and a requirement to temporarily withdraw from the College for students who discussed the exam while it was out.
One student under investigation, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want it known that he is being investigated for academic dishonesty, said he had also heard “through the grapevine” that administrators had drafted a tiered punishment scheme. Like other students, he said he has not yet heard from the Ad Board what, if any, punishment he personally is likely to face.
The Crimson received an email nearly identical to the one which was published on IvyGate, from a source who identified himself only by initials and an anonymous Yahoo email address. The source would not provide his name to Crimson editors, even on condition of anonymity, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal reiterated in an emailed statement that the Ad Board will investigate and issue decisions to students on a case-by-case basis.
“Every case will be reviewed by the Administrative Board individually and will be resolved in accordance with its ordinary policies and procedures, based on the rules of the faculty and the particular circumstances that pertain to the particular student,” Neal wrote.
According to the Ad Board website, the Board must be “sufficiently persuaded” of a student’s guilt to issue punishment. The severity of those penalties depends on both the gravity of the infraction and any “extenuating circumstances,” including a student’s past disciplinary history.
Sanctions for an academic integrity infraction can either preserve or remove a student’s “good standing” at the College.
Possible punishments that do not change a student’s status include an admonition, a mandatory re-do or a failing grade on the assignment in question, a course grade penalty, or a transcript mark equivalent to no credit for the course.
Sanctions that take away a student’s “good standing” at Harvard including a probationary period or a requirement to withdraw from Harvard, typically for a year.
Neal declined to comment on whether the Ad Board has issued decisions yet to any students implicated the scandal.
The same anonymous student who had heard rumors about a punishment scheme said that Ellison told him in a personal meeting that he could expect a decision by November at the latest.
Neal also declined to comment on possible punishments for students under investigation who took the course as seniors and have already left Harvard.
An anonymous alumnus, who graduated in May and learned this summer that he was being investigated, said he is still in the dark about the repercussions he could face.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, there appears to be nothing uncommon about senior Briana Jackucewicz’s victorious performance for the Harvard women’s cross country team over the weekend. A four-year veteran rose to the occasion and led her team to a win, capturing an individual title in the process.
But a closer look at what happened on Saturday at the Nassaney Invitational in Smithfield, R.I., will reveal that Jackucewicz’s outing was far from ordinary.
Though the Howell, N.J., native was recruited to run cross country for the Crimson, a slew of injuries kept her out of competition for the entirety of her first three seasons.
After citing the injuries to her hip, knee, ankle, hamstring, and foot in her speech as part of the Lowell Student Speaker Series last year, Jackucewicz remarked, “Here I am, a junior, yet to race with an H on my chest.”
On Saturday, when she finally had the opportunity to don the crimson H, Jackucewicz put her talents on display. The senior won the women’s five-kilometer race, finishing in 18:00.1, more than five seconds faster than the second-place runner.
“She’s had a tough go,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “But she’s an incredibly resilient young woman, and I was unbelievably impressed with her ability to stick with this and fight through that adversity to have such an outstanding opener. It was really great to see.”
Saretsky and his staff recruited Jackucewicz, who began running when she was just six years old with her older sister, Leisha, and her father, Roger, who ran for Lehigh University.
She appeared to share her father’s talent from an early age, setting the national high school record in the indoor 5k when she was just a seventh grader. Only 13 years old at the time, Briana averaged a blistering 5:23-mile pace to finish in 16:43.
With the consent of her coaches, Jackucewicz recently decided to return to the high-mileage training plan that she followed when she was in high school. After running between 60 and 80 miles per week this summer, she has already begun to feel the difference.
“The key for me was to go back to the [high-mileage] training that has always worked for me,” Jackucewicz said. “Coming into college, I sort of departed from that. After trial and error, and error, and error, I realized that’s what works.”
In addition to logging heavy mileage over the summer, Jackucewicz competed in a number of road races to see how her training was progressing. Even with this racing experience, the senior acknowledged that she had a different feeling before the gun was fired to begin Saturday’s meet.
“I don’t usually get nervous for races,” Jackucewicz said. “That being said, it’s very different to run against middle-aged men and women in a road race than it is to run against your peers in a college race.”
But the senior was able to shake off her pre-race jitters on Saturday, taking the lead in the first mile with a 5:27 split. She indicated that the team’s strategy before the race was to cross the first mile marker at around 5:30.
“I didn’t expect to lead the race,” Jackucewicz said. “It just kind of happened that way.”
When a pair of runners caught up with her in the second mile, Jackucewicz was able to pick up her pace down the stretch and take home the individual title. She averaged 5:47 per mile en route to the victory.
Jackucewicz’s teammate and roommate in Lowell House, senior Samantha Silva, was the Crimson’s third finisher, running a time of 18:23.6 to capture fifth place. Another four-year member of the squad, Silva witnessed her roommate struggle through three injury-plagued seasons to arrive at this moment.
“It was difficult to see your teammate and one of your close friends go through that,” Silva said. “Bri has gone through a lot, but it almost makes it sweeter to see her come back and race so well. We’re all so proud of her.”
With Jackucewicz back in top form, Silva is confident her roommate will continue to be a force to be reckoned with, both in Ivy League cross country and beyond.
“Obviously her body hasn’t worked as well with her these last couple of years,” Silva said. “But I think it was just a matter of figuring out what training works for her…. Now that she knows, I honestly feel like the sky is the limit [for Briana], even after graduation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most Harvard students, the first weekend of the school year seems like a continuation of summer.  The sun is still out, there is barely any work to be done, and hours of free time are waiting to be wasted.
But this was not the case for the Harvard sailing team.  While most were relaxing, the Crimson sailors kicked off their season with a full weekend of competitions.
Harvard competed in three regattas on Saturday and Sunday. A freshmen crew from the coed sailing team finished second in the Tufts Central Series 1 regatta, while other coed racers ended up in the eighth spot at Yale’s Harry Anderson Trophy.  Over at MIT, the women’s sailing team took the eighth position at the Toni Deustch ’58 regatta.
“I saw what I wanted to, which was a strong effort and enthusiasm,” Harvard coach Mike O’Connor said. “Now I have an objective view of what we need to work on. We did some things pretty well, and I’m pleased with the start and pleased with the effort.”
HARRY ANDERSON TROPHY
A group of coed racers headed down to New Haven to compete in the annual Harry Anderson Trophy. It was the largest regatta of the weekend for the Crimson, as the racers were pitted against 16 other teams.
The sailors completed a full slate of races on Saturday, but the good weather did not continue into Sunday. Due to a weak breeze, only two races were held on what should have been day two of competition.
Harvard scored 127 points over the course of the regatta, resulting in an eighth place finish. Yale, the event host, won the regatta with 62 points.
Sophomore Gram Slattery, his classmate Brian Drumm, and junior Benjamin Lamont competed in the A division for the Crimson. This trio recorded 83 points, which was tenth best in their respective division.
Senior Jason Michas teamed with sophomores Michael Drumm and Reid Bergsund to score 44 points in the B Division, amassing the third lowest score in the division.
Michas, one of the senior leaders on the team, thought the squad performed well in its first regatta of the season.
“I think we were all trying to establish our positions on the team,” Michas said.  “It was our first regatta of the season, so we were all a little rusty, but we were excited to get out and compete after practicing all week “
WOMEN’S TONI DEUTSCH ’58 TROPHY
The women’s team did not have to travel far for their races in MIT’s Women’s Toni Deutsch ’58 Trophy Regatta.  Harvard scored 104 points in both the A and B divisions.  The total of 208 landed the Crimson in the eighth overall spot.
The A division team of juniors Morgan Russom and Isabel Ruane won the first race of the day.  The racing tandem finished in the top-five five times. Juniors Caitlin Watson and Jacquelyn Cooley, the B division duo, followed suit with five top-five finishes of their own.
The women’s team from Yale managed to take home the trophy with 101 total points, while the hosts from MIT sailed to a fifth place finish with 175 points.
TUFTS CENTRAL SERIES 1
A young crew of Harvard sailors traveled to Tufts to compete in the Tufts Central Series 1 regatta.  Freshmen Andrew Mollerus, Sydney Karnovsky, Marek Zaleski, and Sophie Bermudez represented the Crimson in their first collegiate regatta.
Skipper Mollerus and his crew Karnovksy competed in the A division for Harvard. The freshmen duo started their careers on the right note with a win in their division. After eighteen races, they stood atop the field with 94 points.
On Saturday, Zaleski skippered the B division boat while junior Alice Kenney served as crew. Bermudez and sophomore Ashleigh Ingis took over the B division boat on Sunday.  These four racers totaled 84 points, second best in their division.
The Crimson finished with 178 points, just nine points behind the winners from Boston University.
While Coach O’Connor is pleased with how his team started the season, he acknowledges that there is still a long way to go.
“We’re going to work on starts, boat-handling, and timing,” Coach O’Connor said. “We need to be more consistent, and we are going to continue to work hard to polish our boat handling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In addition to late nights at the Kong and a couple of long-term projects with friends, this summer I had the pleasure of covering the Olympics for the Crimson. I use the word “pleasure” very deliberately. Rarely do you hear summer interns refer to their jobs so favorably, but despite time differences and forced acclimation to sports I was unfamiliar with (see: rowing), reporting on the stories of Harvard’s nine Olympians alongside Jacob D. H. Feldman ’15 was nothing short of a wonderful experience.
The Olympics are often criticized for excess media attention and particular focus on human-interest stories. Before this summer you could count me among the foremost of those critics. A general rule of thumb I’ve used is that—unless you’ve won a championship or are an MVP—if my grandmother has heard of you while watching Good Morning America, chances are you’re not worth the price of admission to a pure sports fan.
I didn’t care who Derek Jeter was dating or how hard Shawn Johnson’s parents had pushed her; I watched sports for the experience of watching the sport.
My time on the Crimson sports board has contributed to that cynicism. My fellow editors would come to our weekly meetings pitching a story about a water polo player who had a really cool upbringing and my initial reaction would be, ‘Who cares, if he’s a scrub?’
If a friend praised an athlete for their work ethic or ‘mental toughness,’ I rolled my eyes. As a very quantitatively minded person, this is hard to admit, but after two months covering and getting to know some of the best athletes in the world, I’m beginning to see value in looking past the numbers.
Whether it was Samyr Laine ’06 competing for his parents’ home of Haiti in an effort to raise support for the struggling island nation’s youth athletic programs or Esther Lofgren ’07-’09 bringing home Olympic gold 28 years after her mother missed out on her Olympic dream at the 1984 Los Angeles Games—leading to, as her mother put it, “her post Olympic conception”—these people all had incredible stories to tell.
Even if you separated them from their athletic accomplishments, their stories were worth telling. In addition to being the subject of four separate stories by deadspin.com concerning the size of his penis, bronze medalist Henrik Rummel ’09 was born and raised in Copenhagen before moving to America and taking up crew as a result of his middling talents on the basketball court.
These weren’t the stories of stereotypical jocks either. Two-time gold medalist Caryn Davies ’04-’05 is a year away from earning a law degree from Columbia. Laine just finished his J.D. at Georgetown. How’s that for your self-esteem?
Alex Meyer ’10 embarked on a personal mission to honor the memory of a fallen friend, fellow long-distance swimmer Fran Crippen who died in competition in October 2010. Meyer and Crippen bonded as roommates on the world tour. After sitting out due to fatigue in a competition in Dubai, Meyer led the search party that eventually found Crippen’s drowned body in the 87 degree Fahrenheit water. From then on, he wore Crippen’s swim cap under his own with the hope of wearing it on the podium as the “Star Spangled Banner” played over the PA system in London.
Forget the fact that Meyer finished 10th in London, that is a story! It’s a story that makes grown men everywhere pretend they have something in their eye. It’s the kind of human interest BS story that my grandma always fell for, and now I was falling for it too.
Don’t get me wrong, I understand that the only reason I was writing about these people’s stories was because of incredible success on their respective playing fields. But in a way, that only reinforced something we at Harvard and indeed we as humans, too often overlook.
Whether it’s because we don’t have the time or lack the interest, people often miss out on the incredible stories that are so readily accessible if you just have the courage to ask. Luckily for me, my job this summer necessitated it.
A couple weeks ago I found out that one of my blockmates spent part of the summer recording and producing a mix-tape of raps that he’d been writing since high school. I had no idea. At a family gathering in August I decided to ask my grandpa to clarify some of the stories he used to tell me as a kid. Turns out while living under Nazi and Italian occupation in Greece during World War II, he and some neighborhood friends helped smuggle Jews out of the port of Kavala and to freedom. Consider my mind blown.
So next time you find yourself sitting in a d-hall having a generic conversation with someone about what classes they’re taking, what party they’re going to, and “he said, she said,” take a moment to step back and look past the numbers and really find a story. Chances are you won’t regret it.

The stage in Sanders Theatre is flanked by marble statues of important men draped in cloth and gesturing grandly—hardly the expected venue for discourses about fisting and an apocalypse-themed prom. However, on September 1, young comics from Harvard brought these and a range of other irreverent themes to the stage during LMAO: A Night of Comedy.
The event included performances from campus groups Harvard College Stand-Up Comedy Society, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, Immediate Gratification Players, On Harvard Time, On Thin Ice, Respectably French!, and Three Letter Acronym, with professional comic Harrison R. Greenbaum ’08 headlining. The Crimson sat down with Doug M. Bright ’13 (OHT; TLA), Carina M. Livoti ’14 (HCSUCS), Andrew N. Shindi ’13 (OHT; OTI), Katherine C. Damm ’13 (IGP), and Tessa M. Kaplan ’13 (HPT) for a roundtable discussion of what it means to be a comic.
 The Harvard Crimson: So, does being a comedian help you or hinder you romantically?
Katherine C. Damm: Definitely helps. That’s all I’ll say.
Doug M. Bright: People like people who can make [them] laugh. I probably don’t do it on purpose, like as a way to trap people.
Andrew N. Shindi: I mean, do you guys tell people that you do comedy when you’re meeting someone new or going on a date?
DMB: [Snorts] No.
KCD: I do, and they’re always like, “Really?”
ANS: Or you tell them and they say, “Oh! Be funny! Do something funny, like, right now.”
Carina M. Livoti: Just slap them in the face and walk away.
ANS: My fallback is to pretend I’m Henry Clay. “Great Compromiser? I hardly know her!”
 THC: Is there anything that makes you laugh out loud? Or are you jaded?
ANS: Very jaded.
KCD: I laugh at everything.
CML: If you came to a stand-up meeting and performed your material for us, if people are nodding, you’re doing well. People get nervous and think, “Oh no, I’m not funny.” It’s not that you’re not funny. It’s that we’re jaded.
 THC: Tell me about LMAO.
ANS: The purpose of LMAO is to get Harvard freshmen, or really anyone at the College, interested in comedy at Harvard…. People think that we’re just, like, not funny individuals who only study and make really great social networking sites, and that’s not true.
 THC: Have you ever had a joke that you were excited about that bombed?
CML: Oh, God, stand-up. That’s what we’re all about…I think stand-up is different from improv because the jokes are like your babies. You come up with a concept…you run it past some people, and you keep playing with it until you feel like you can deliver it in front of an audience. And sometimes, that joke that you nursed all the way up—you get in front of the audience, and they’re not in sync with your dementia.
THC: Do you have an example?
KCD: Yeah—just relive that memory, in front of all of us.
CML: I’ve done whole shows where it feels like you bombed…my best example is myfreshman spring. We did a show in Quincy Cage…. I didn’t feel like anyone laughed at my jokes, but there were also clanging pipes and they were sitting on the floor inside of a cage.
DMB: That’s interesting that you mention that [venue], because when we’re dealing with LMAO, we’re dealing with the complete opposite…an awkwardly formal space.
ANS: Hallowed, academic ground.
 THC: If you were having a terrible show, and it was a forgone conclusion that people would throw things at you, what would you want thrown at you?
CML: Johnny Depp.
KCD: Money. Just make it rain.
ANS: I get hungry late at night, so food would be fine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The seventh century “Kneeling Attendant Bodhisattva,” constructed of unbaked clay over a wooden frame, stands a modest four feet high. Pale hands clasped in prayer, legs bent and colorfully garbed, the fragile statue has been on display in the Harvard Art Museums since its arrival in the 1920s. But five years ago, had an art historian wanted to research the story of the statue’s exodus from China to Cambridge or to read curator Langdon Warner’s first-hand description of discovering the piece, the search would have been difficult at the Museums’ Archives.
Last month, the Archives announced the completion of a project to catalog items from its collection, which also include documents concerning the early development of the Harvard Art Museums and letters from T.S. Eliot and Georgia O’Keeffe. Archives materials were also made searchable online and associated with “finding aids” written by archivists. The effort began in 2007, when the Archives received grants for the project from both the Getty Foundation and the Institute of Museum and Library Services’ Museums for America program.
When Archives curator Susan J. von Salis joined the Archives staff in 2003, she says, there was no formal archival program. The Archives, which had been located in the basement of the Fogg Museum, consisted of historically significant documents and letters filed in cabinets that were at one point the victims of water damage. “There were lots of important historical materials, but they were not cataloged,” von Salis says. “There was no way to find them.” When researchers made requests with the Archives, von Salis recalls, a staffer would go by her memory of the Archives’ collection to try to find the material the researchers desired.
Kathryn L. Brush, a professor of art history at the University of Western Ontario, used the pre-cataloging Archive while researching her book “Vastly More Than Brick and Mortar: Reinventing the Fogg Art Museum in the 1920s.” Her search led her to folders and collections filled with history of the Harvard Art Museums: enrollment figures and course offerings; information on past, present, and potential Harvard Art Museum acquisitions; and letters between former Fogg Museum Director Edward W. Forbes and Associate Director Paul J. Sachs. She remembers digging through the Archives’ uncataloged files: “Most of the research for that book relied on what might be called detective work or guesswork because there was no finding aid.”
Brush witnessed much of the cataloging process take place. Approximately 13,800 folders were cataloged, and the Archives finding aids were put online in the Harvard University Library’s Online Archival Search Information System. And as the project continued, archivists unearthed items they did not even know their collection included. “Every day, new materials were discovered,” Brush says.
The Archives holds treasures for art historians or enthusiasts—for example, correspondence by American sculptor Alexander Calder, whose sculpture “The Onion” sits in Harvard Yard, and accounts on the efforts of the “Monuments Men,” who worked to protect and retrieve works of art during and after World War II. For acting Archivist/Records Manager Megan J. Schwenke, letters between American portrait painter John Singer Sargent and former Art Museums directors were of particular interest. “To be someone who has gotten to appreciate a Sargent work in the [Isabella Stewart] Gardner Museum or here and then be able to see words written in his own hand—to me, that’s an art object as well, of a different sort,” Schwenke says.
But, she adds, the Archives also hold materials concerning disciplines outside the arts. “There are so many collections at Harvard for students of art history and just for students who are interested in history in general,” she says. Social historians, for instance, could research former Fogg director Sachs’ World War II-era correspondence, which details how he helped save the lives of curators fleeing Europe. Other materials cover the details of museum logistics, such as documentation of Harvard museums’ finances and accounts of artifact preservation techniques.
Von Salis feels that key functions of the Archives are to provide interaction with primary sources and the context they lend to art and history. “To me, archives are really about the story that the documents tell—you really lose a lot of the picture if you don’t allow yourself to be engaged by the stories,” she says. “You can read about events in a history book, but looking at primary source documentation really makes it come alive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Just be friendly. Friendly and aloof,” Penelope O’Shaunessy’s mother advises her as they drive from her hometown in Connecticut to Cambridge. Though Penelope concedes, “OK,” she notes skeptically, “A reconciliation of opposites.”
Penelope is the hapless protagonist of a new novel, “Penelope” by Rebecca M. Harrington ’08, a former Crimson arts editor. The novel follows its gawky namesake through her turbulent freshman year at Harvard.
Members of the Class of 2016 undoubtedly received similarly conflicting advice from their parents only a week or two ago, the most common: study hard and have fun! And all students probably share similar fears about social skills.
If a freshman does not share these basic woes, the student probably a) already knows the particular social stratum into which he/she would like to neatly insert him/herself or b) does not want friends. These opposing categories also tidily define Penelope’s two archetypal roommates. One roommate, Emma, is a melodramatic and manipulative social-climber from New York City who cries over “Pudding stuff.” Her other roommate, Lan from Palo Alto, is a terse genius who socializes mainly with her cat, Raymond, Penelope’s fourth roommate in their Pennypacker triple.
Lodged between her two extreme roommates, Penelope, shiftless and clueless, flits around campus looking for friends and romance. Ultimately, the overly amenable and passive Penelope does not attain the social life she desires. Her problem seems to lie in her bizarre social conduct, described in a telling moment between her and the director of a production of “Caligula.”
The director critiques Penelope’s maneuvering of a marionette during rehearsal, commenting, “It just looks too much like a marionette, Penelope. It’s incredibly stiff. I need it to mimic the fluidities of human motion as much as possible while, at the same time, ironically referencing the artificiality of theatre itself.” The director’s absurd demand seems to manifest Penelope’s central struggle in the novel: how to navigate conflicting and puzzling situations at Harvard. Moreover, the director’s comment reflects the way Harrington herself strays from traditional campus novels that depict college as a transformative experience. In “Penelope,” the absurdity of college experience can be conveyed only through parody.
STRANGELY BLANK
Neither Penelope the character nor “Penelope” the novel have any significant narrative thrust. The plot can be essentially summed up in list form: Penelope meets her roommates; hangs out in her entryway; takes a silly-sounding General Education class; goes to a party at a club named “The S---,” kisses a drunk boy; kisses an awkward boy, kisses an “international playboy;” comps the Harvard Advocate; gets suckered into an extracurricular she hates; gets in a fight with her roommate; and eventually learns that everyone is pretending to be someone they’re not.
Most sophomores could check off at least half if not all the items on this list. But even if her experiences are typical, Penelope’s perspective is unique. Her observations are incisive and at times laugh-out-loud funny. One of her quips: “Homework was like a North Star that everyone turned to.” Her eccentric ideas of decorum—including if you say “hello,” “cool,” and “awesome,” everyone will like you—are endearing, yet she remains a strangely blank slate and never outgrows her awkwardness or social ineptitude.
Despite its lack of traditionally vital elements of storytelling, the novel works. There’s not much plot and the characters are not developed but it’s not the traditional coming-of-age story that would require those elements. The novel succeeds by virtue of its amusing and often searing profile of a dysfunctional Harvard that runs on elaborately bullshitted papers and even more elaborately constructed personae. Penelope manages to bump into all manner of Harvard caricatures, allowing Harrington’s satirical voice to shine.
NYC WHAC-A-MOLE
If the book’s cover—an image of two hands about to dig into a Veritaffle—is a gentle hint at the mockery to come, the first page is a slap in the face. The book opens with the correspondence between Penelope and her roommates. The first Facebook message, from Emma, sketches a gag-worthy portrait of the absurdly ambitious and unthinkably obnoxious girl from New York City. “I can’t believe I’m going to be missing out on New York pizza and dry cleaning for a whole four years!” she writes.
My freshman year often felt like a never-ending game of Whac-A-Mole, in which I whacked the New York private school stereotype instead of moles. The dry cleaning comment certainly elevated my blood pressure, but it was the following line in Emma’s note that made me twitch. In this emetic message, Emma mentions that she attended the Spence School—the very school I had attended for 13 years. While I knew many Emmas in my time at Spence, Harrington’s use of the proper noun seemed intrusive and impertinent.
Harrington’s trespassing continued when Penelope wanders into the comp for the fiction board of the Advocate, which Harrington depicts as a modish bastion of literary pretension. Besides the Advocate being the oldest continually published college literary magazine in America, it is also the magazine of which I recently became an enthusiastic member of both the poetry and executive boards.
The fiction editor of the Advocate, Patrick W. Lauppe ’13, also an arts editor of the Crimson, thinks Harrington took “easy shots” with her portrayal of the magazine. “‘Penelope’ is a tremendous achievement by a recent Harvard grad, and I really respect her for it,” Lauppe says. “And though I do recognize definite accuracies, which are pretty funny, I feel like it’s almost a freak show.”
“MUM SENT THE JET”
Harrington does not single out the Advocate in her satire. Most characters Penelope encounters are starring members  in Harrington’s circus of Harvard freaks. Penelope goes to the Peter Pan themed comp party at the Advocate hoping to run into Gustav, the sexy German/Argentinean billionaire from her “Counting People” section, a Gen Ed that actually was taught at Harvard. Though she doesn’t see him at the Peter Pan party, Penelope eventually ends up running into Gustav when Emma begrudgingly brings her to a party at the “S---” Club, where Gustav is a member. Before Gustav pulls Penelope into a confusing after-hours-only romance, he sends her a ridiculous text: “Skiing in Japan for foreseeable future and Mum sent the jet early. Drinks when we get back? xx.” While absurd, it might not be farfetched coming from the exotic and well-groomed men I often see smoking cigarettes on the stoop outside Schoenhof’s Foreign Books. It is unclear why this club was the only proper noun modified in the novel, as Harrington changes nothing else to disguise the fact that she is seemingly referring to the Spee.
Harrington’s stereotypes are obviously off-putting to the people who identify with these institutions. But perhaps pushing against these preconceptions and reconciling them with self-images might actually be formative to those individuals who are parodied. Penelope’s experiences are not actually formative at all; her sense of self is limited and does not develop over the course of the novel. However, this lack of definition in Penelope’s character, alongside her frustrating agreeability, not only makes her a comic contrast to the hyper-ambitious extremes around her but also makes her the only character the reader can identify with.  Every reader, explicitly targeted or not, can experience the simultaneously embracing and alienating experience of making friends and fitting in.
A LONESOME PACK
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 understands the issue at hand in “Penelope.” He believes it is the responsibility of the Freshman Dean’s Office to provide spaces for interaction among the freshman class. He expresses frustration over the challenging layout of the Yard with its scant physical settings for social activities. “Hurlbut, Pennypacker and Greenough especially suffer from being away from things, but this summer we committed to converting a student suite in Pennypacker to a common room with a giant flat screen TV,” Dingman says.
Though Penelope and Harrington’s shared satirical outlook lends unusual sincerity to her novel, Harrington is hardly a duplicate of her hapless protagonist aside from both living in Pennypacker. I met her near Astor Place, around the corner from her office at The Huffington Post, where she has worked as a senior editor since graduating from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Stylish, cheery, and composed, Harrington chatted with me about the literary groundings of “Penelope” and about her experiences at Harvard.
While she made clear that her freshman experience was not exactly like Penelope’s, she did note some similarities. “Her life was basically more exciting and interesting than mine. She did more things…. I would go to the library, and I’d try to make friends with people there,” Harrington says with an air of self-deprecation. She also, like Penelope, often found herself hanging out on the steps outside Pennypacker.
Given Dingman’s worries, “Penelope” addresses valid concerns about the social challenges of freshman year. Furthermore, it challenges a prominently held view of the college experience and maturation more generally.
“THE LEGGINGS PARADOX”
Though Harrington wrote the manuscript of “Penelope” in four months, she edited it for two years, attempting to create a specific effect in opposition to the traditional American campus novel. She explained that she was reading a lot of 1930s British campus novels set at Oxford and Cambridge when she came up with the idea of Penelope. “Instead of viewing the educational experience as this kind of transcendentalist experience that deeply changes you as we do in America,” Harrington says, “in England it’s like, let’s go to five cocktail parties and be super embarrassing and funny.”
Harrington holds that Harvard is analogous to Oxbridge in American society, and it is particularly ripe for satire. “I had an experience that was much more like a linking together of absurd accidents than I did a transformative bildungsroman,” Harrington says. Her experience made it easier for her to identify with the madcap British campus novels.
Though parody may seem less powerful or profound than traditional bildungroman form, Harrington’s unique treatment is actually deeply insightful. “I purposefully made Penelope’s interiority shallow and socially expressed…. I think right or wrongly, people really think interiority is the vessel to profundity when you are reading,” Harrington says. “I’ve always felt that these novels about social experience are more elucidating than novels of interiority. Because we’re all the same, but there are so many quirks in the way people behave socially that are alienating and somehow extremely poignant even if you’re not particularly invested in the interiority of whoever’s there.” Indeed, the absence of interiority makes “Penelope” seem shallow, but it is precisely this shallowness that makes the novel uniquely illuminating. The lack of significance attached to individual events of the novel actually seems to assert how life, collegiate or otherwise, is less meaningful or transformative than we would like to think.
Though she did not write “Penelope” until after graduation, Harrington’s talent for comedic social commentary was evident in the fashion column she once wrote for the Crimson Arts section. At the end of each column, she would offer three tips for embracing or avoiding a certain fashion trend (e.g., “The Leggings Paradox Solved”). She may have thought her Crimson Arts career was a thing of the past, but in the spirit of tradition, I asked Harrington to offer three tips for incoming freshmen in this very issue. A few days after we met, she emailed me the following:
1) Your Harvard sweatshirt is not your friend.  It is, in fact, your enemy and should be regarded as such.
2) Your freshman year is a time to meet new people! Sit with random students in Annenberg and ask them hypothetical questions such as, ‘Would you rather be married to Jon Bon Jovi or live alone forever?’ Talk about endearing.
3) Have fun!  Remember, if you study less during the day than you were planning on, nothing will happen!  Except for eternal shame.
TRIVIAL PURSUITS
Another work of fiction set at Harvard, also released this year, serves as telling counterpoint to “Penelope.” “The Red Book” by Deborah E. Copaken Kogan ’88 centers around four best friends and roommates from the class of ’89 who return to Harvard for their 20th reunion in the throes of the economic recession. The novel takes its title and its structure from a publication that arrives at the doorsteps of Harvard alums once every five years. The Harvard Red Book, sent out by the Class Report Office, contains essays and contact information submitted by class members. The slogan of the novel presents its theme: “There’s the story you tell the world, and then there’s the real story.”
While Kogan’s novel, unlike Harrington’s, subscribes to the traditional view of education as a decisively formative experience, it seems to show that the experience is not a seamless, straightforward transformation. “We’re all just these fumbling, imperfect, silly people stumbling along in the dark trying to make our way in life. And unfortunately, having a Harvard degree means nothing when it comes to figuring oneself out,” Kogan says. “That’s the work that has to be done on your own, slowly and painfully through trial and error and lots and lots of mistakes.”
Both Kogan’s and Harrington’s novels challenge pre-existing ideas about Harvard and the broader genre of campus novels, but ultimately “Penelope” is the more shrewd of the two. Does it sincerely represent the undergraduate student body? Hardly. Did we expect it to, with its hot-pink cover emblazoned with a rare breed of Veritaffle containing not the Veritas shield but rather a large H? Not for a second. The best part about Harrington’s novel is how it does not attempt to be something it is not. Perhaps the lack of pretension and glamour surrounding the collegiate experience in “Penelope” is something to learn from. “It’s just a series of experiences,” Harrington says. “Some of them are okay. Some of them are not okay. And the stakes are pretty low no matter what.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The bouquet was frozen with liquid nitrogen and interlaced with explosives. It was filmed sitting motionless on a table, and the video could be mistaken for a painting—until the vase detonates, shattered into petals and glass that fall in slow motion against a backdrop of sirens. Israeli artist Ori Gersht’s 2006 “Big Bang” is far from your typical still life. Instead, Gersht uses an unassuming floral arrangement as a launching point, capturing its subsequent explosion with the clarity of high-speed digital video equipment.
“Big Bang” is emblematic of Gersht’s work—the artist strives to expose the violence that pervades the human experience, says Al Miner, who curated the new Museum of Fine Arts exhibit “Ori Gersht: History Repeating.” The exhibit, which runs through January 6, is the first comprehensive survey of Gersht’s work, placing pieces that span almost 15 years of his career together for the first time. It features 25 Gersht pieces—17 photographs and eight short films—alongside six pieces relevant to Gersht’s work, selected by the artist from the MFA’s permanent collection.
The photographs and short films featured in the exhibit were shot in varying locations, including Israel, Japan, and England, and many develop common themes of violence, memory, and diaspora. Gersht himself was born and raised in Israel and completed mandatory service in the Israeli army as a medic, where his experiences, he says, inspired him to pursue photography as a career. Since then, the London-based artist has been enticed by places with histories of suffering—he has travelled as far as Hiroshima and the passes of the Pyreneees, which provided a treacherous way to safety in Holocaust-era Europe.
Gersht depicts these sites in still photography and videography, and he sometimes alludes to their tragic histories with startling images and juxtapositions. “[They are] tangible physical places, but they [become] almost imaginary places,” Gersht said. In “Evaders,” a 2009 dual-channel film, two screens lie side by side in a blackened room: on the right side, a storm advances over a pastoral Pyrenees landscape, while on the left, a haggard man staggers toward the viewer. A placard identifies the man as Walter Benjamin, the German-Jewish intellectual who took his own life while fleeing the Nazis.
Despite the overt reference to Benjamin, Gersht denies any partiality to the hardships suffered by his own religious group at the hands of Nazi Germany. “I don’t find my work related directly to the Holocaust, but as more of a universal experience. Every work tries to immerse itself in the past.”
Gersht’s photographs fall into two categories: images he took while filming his short pieces and standalone works whose rich colors and soft lines seem painted. “Far Off Mountains and Rivers” is a 2009 example of the former, a still photograph of the “Evaders” landscape. “The piece is at once beautiful but also foreboding,” Miner said.
The standalone photographs touch upon large-scale tragedies through indirect imagery. Gersht’s 2003 “Dead Dog” at first glance seems to be a simple landscape, bucolic in its lush green mountains and blue horizon. However, Gersht shot “Dead Dog” in Galicia, a region in Spain known as the “coast of death” after it was stricken by a disastrous oil spill in 2002. Gersht steers away from obvious indications of the tragedy; the vivid colors are unmarred by sludgy browns, and the water itself is only a faint sliver at the photograph’s center. A small, rotted dog skeleton at the forefront is the only evidence that the tableau is more sinister than it seems.
Much of Gersht’s work is closely linked to the Holocaust and the tragedies that modern Israel is now facing—“Evaders,” for example—but “History Repeating” also includes a piece that makes direct allusion to Palestinian suffering. His 2001 single-channel film “Neither Black Nor White” looks out from above onto the unlit village of Iksal, an Arab community within Israel. Over the course of the short film, the nighttime of the original scene gradually whitens, suggesting the sunrise. But when day appears to have arrived, blinding brightness continues to fill the frame, as if a bomb has just gone off. “Neither Black Nor White” points to Gersht’s desire to expose equally the suffering of the world’s people, not confining the subjects of his work to a single experience or culture.
“I want these images to resonate in an open and almost meta-lingual way,” he said. The pieces in “History Repeating” show Gersht to be consistent in this approach, be they of oil spills or Middle Eastern warfare.

Updated 9/12/12 at 1:10 a.m.
Men’s basketball co-captain Kyle D. Casey ’13 has chosen to withdraw from Harvard because of potential disciplinary action relating to the investigation of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Sports Illustrated reported early Tuesday morning. The Boston Herald later reported that fellow co-captain Brandyn T. Curry ’13 is also implicated in the scandal and likely to take a leave of absence as well.
Casey is expected to miss the 2012-13 basketball season, as is Curry should he decide to withdraw.
Leaving the College before Tuesday’s study card deadline would likely protect both players' fourth and final year of Ivy League eligibility, allowing them to return for the 2013-14 season. If the players had been forced by the Administrative Board to take a leave of absence after they had already registered for classes, they would have lost the year of eligibility.
Both Casey and Curry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In an internal email between College administrators obtained by The Crimson—which a resident dean confirmed was sent to other resident deans—Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison suggested that fall athletes might “consider taking [a leave of absence] before their first game.”
Casey, who led the Crimson in scoring as a junior, was expected to contend for Ivy League Player of the Year in 2012-13. The 2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, he has averaged double-digit scoring totals in each of his three seasons at Harvard and his offensive load was expected to increase in his senior season.
Curry, a two-time Academic All-Ivy honoree, paced the Crimson in assists and steals and was fourth on the team in scoring a year ago.
Both played a pivotal role last season in helping Harvard earn its first NCAA tournament berth since 1946. They were expected to provide veteran leadership for a squad that had been predicted to be a strong contender for its third consecutive Ivy League title in 2012-13.
With Casey’s departure and the graduation of Keith A. Wright ’12, the Crimson will be forced to rely inside on forwards E. Steve Moundou-Missi ’15, Jonah A. Travis ’15, and Kenyatta A. Smith ’15, none of whom have ever started at the collegiate level. If Curry withdraws or does not play this season, Siyani T. Chambers ’16 will likely handle the bulk of the point guard duties.
Such an event would leave wing Laurent Rivard ’14 as the only returning starter from Harvard’s NCAA tournament team. Wesley S. Saunders ’15—who led the team in scoring during its summer trip to Italy—would also pick up a much larger offensive load.
Director of Athletic Communications Kurt K. Svoboda said that neither Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise nor Harvard coach Tommy Amaker would comment on the situation, citing privacy laws. Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris also declined to comment.
The men’s basketball team is not the only athletic squad affected by the cheating scandal, in which about 125 students have been implicated. The Harvard football team is also dealing with fallout from the incident, and at least one key offensive player will miss time due to the investigation—a loss nonetheless less severe than the withdrawal of forty percent of a five-man starting lineup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As our readers in the class of 2013 know, the race for Class Marshal is intense. Candidates from across the campus have taken to creative methods to win the votes for the position: Facebook events, Facebook posts, and Facebook messages all come to mind.
But in the world of Class Marshal campaigning, Jim Deng wins.
 
Deng, a senior offensive lineman for Harvard football, took to the dining halls and locker rooms to film his campaign video, along with the help of some of his teammates.
 
Yes, the concept seems to have been developed on a late weekend night at the Kong. Sure, the entire premise of the video (a Bollywood ad for Deng, described as “One Large Asian”) makes absolutely no sense. But the video is really freakin’ funny.
 
Like last spring’s Call Me Maybe craze with Harvard baseball, part of Deng’s campaign appeal is just how terrible the choreography is throughout. But the video also gives us a few hilarious moments that everyone on campus (save the seven or eight people that have blown up my inbox this morning with solicitations for their vote) can enjoy, including:
 
1. Deng hugging strangers. Everyone loves a man who randomly hugs strangers.
2. The comically bad videography. Whoever was filming at the 27 second mark, take your hand out of the frame please.
3. The shirtless, helmet-rocking Deng may—and probably should—surpass Jack Colton’s snooze in the back of the Call-Me-Maybe van as Harvard’s viral moment of the year. 
 
The faux-violence scene could definitely use some work, but I’ve watched it about five times now and I still haven’t stopped laughing.
 
Plus, let’s be real: the primary responsibility of the Class Marshal is to help run senior week. And what happens during senior week? A lot of strangers hugging/high-fiving/pointing at strangers. Deng seems to have all of that down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The American Repertory Theater’s production of “Marie Antoinette” is a spectacle befitting its opulent inspiration, filled with both flamboyant costumes and intricate wordplay. Alice S. Austin and Mikey W. Krajnak—who provide audio description and signing for blind and hard-of-earing pations of “Marie Antoinette”—acknowledge that the historical complexity inherent to the show makes for a unique set of challenges. Austin, the audio describer for the show, gives an account of the play’s action to its blind audiences with a detailed running commentary of all the action on stage. Krajnak, who currently works as the A.R.T.’s American Sign Language (ASL) coach, coordinates the translation of the show’s sound into a complex visual grammar. Both are integral parts of the A.R.T.’s initiative to supply audio description and ASL interpretation for its shows. This season, the A.R.T. will provide these features for three of its upcoming productions: “Marie Antoinette,” “Pippin,” and “The Glass Menagerie.” Austin and Krajnak’s see themselves as translators as opposed to interpreters, and they seek to render faithful versions of the original shows through radically transformed means.
According to Anna C. Fitzloff, the director of marketing and communications for the A.R.T., the company began putting more effort into ASL interpretation and audio description after these efforts were so well recieved during last year’s production of “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess.”  “It was so successful,” Fitzloff says. “We had tremendous response from the community.  One woman travelled from San Francisco to see the show.” Fitzloff adds that the ASL interpretation was also well received by the members of the community who are not hard of hearing, noting that one subscriber approached her after the show to praise the signing.
Krajnak doesn’t think he’s succeeded, however, unless his translation of the production is as true to the original as possible. “My responsibility is to understand the vision of the show. I’m trying to get a firm grasp on that because that governs everything else,” he says. As an ASL coach, Krajnak will seek out qualified interpreters whose style best fits the production, a role that Fitzloff compares to that of a casting director. Austin follows a similar model; to prepare, she’ll research the show and see the production multiple times in order to develop a script. “I’ll write a script at home and practice it for timing and accuracy,” she says. “I actually attend a general production like any other, and I practice to myself,”
Krajnak’s views on the importance of direct translation stem from working as an ASL coach on a production of “The Sound of Music.” He had put an enormous amount of work into the show, which included translating iconic songs like “Do-Re-Mi” into ASL. “The audience said, ‘I enjoyed it,’ but they asked, ‘Is this like a new show?’” Krajnak recalls. “I realized that I had failed in that part. I didn’t listen to the audience. They’re paying tickets to see the show but they didn’t get what they needed.”
Since then, Krajnak has been more attuned to the difficulties of translation, and part of this difficulty stems from the fact that ASL is a language unto itself. “It has its own syntax, not only in America but all over the world,” he explains. For “Marie Antoinette,” he chose to directly translate the play’s many puns and double entendres, instead of simply capturing the gist of what is being said. According to Brendan P. Shea, an education and community programs associate at the A.R.T., that decision was informed by conversations Mikey had with his audience. “They said this is what we want, and that if it’s translated, we’re not getting the whole thing,” Shea says.
This emphasis on fidelity also crops up in Austin’s job as an audio describer. She must give her listeners linguistic clues that they will be able to decipher in the same way a sighted audience interprets visual information. To do this effectively, she must make sure her descriptions are as aesthetically interesting as possible, a task she names as one of her biggest challenges. “I can’t say that someone has an angry expression or a sad expression. I have to use words like a furrowed brow or a downturned mouth,” she says.
Krajnak has his own linguistic challenges.  Since ASL is a relatively new language, its vocabulary often reflects modernity in a way that can be jarring for historical plays like “Marie Antoinette.” According to Krajnak, the sign for the city of Paris resembles the Eiffel Tower; iconic, surely, but also nonexistent in the eighteenth century. To ensure his translation’s authenticity, he needed to find a replacement. “We researched and we found that there were some basic signs for Paris,” Krajnak says. “You have to sign a P in the middle of the hand.”
Such details may go unnoticed by the majority of the A.R.T.’s audience when the first ASL interpreted performance is staged. Austin, whose voice is piped into headsets from the stage manager’s booth, will be even more imperceptible. Yet the reactions to these efforts that the A.R.T. has received, Fitzloff says, is enough to continue them. She attributes the success of the A.R.T.’s program to its reliance on skilled performers such as Krajnak and Austin.
“We didn’t have a program we adopted,” Fitzloff says. “People came to us who were experts in their field and said this is the best way to do it.”
