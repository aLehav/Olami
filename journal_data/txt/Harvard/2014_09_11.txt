After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Near the end of the first act of “Finding Neverland,” playwright J.M. Barrie’s life begins to implode. His wife leaves him for a foppish millionaire, his producer and contracted cast are breathing down his neck to produce a new play, and the mother of the woman that he has fallen for bans her daughter from seeing him. Barrie (Jeremy Jordan) descends into a fantastical vision fueled by the taut and macabre number “Circus of Your Mind.” The stage darkens and fogs as Barrie hurtles through the doors of his producer, his wife’s boudoir, and his paramour’s house. Choreographer Mia Michaels has the chorus carry the doors in a hypnotic circular motion around Barrie, who occasionally escapes through one of the doors only to find himself surrounded again. The overall effect is staggering—rarely does a musical number so effectively captures despair and confusion.
“Circus of Your Mind” is one of several show-stopping, emotional ballads that buoys the piece. Some of the sweeter ensemble moments, from a trite bar scene to an obnoxiously flamboyant freak-out by Barrie’s anxious cast, take away from the overall effect of the show. The freshness of the darker musical numbers and dynamism of the cast salvage these occasional stumbles into simplicity and sweetness, practically ensuring that “Finding Neverland” will be a Broadway success.
The show, inspired by the darker and decidedly more adult 2004 film of the same name, explores Barrie’s conception of Peter Pan, which runs in parallel to his increasingly intense relationship with widow Sylvia Llwelyn Davis (Laura Michelle Kelly) and her four young boys (Alex Dreier, Hayden Signoretti, Sawyer Nunes, and Aidan Gemme). The imaginative games and adventures that Barrie embarks on with the family provide the initial inspiration for his iconic project, which forms as his marriage slips away and his professional career is in the balance. While Peter Pan is (obviously) lauded, Barrie’s world is suddenly too good to be true—the eventual shift towards the maudlin can be seen from a mile away, but that doesn’t make it pack any less of a punch.
The music that accompanies Barrie’s alternately tragic and triumphant trajectory is consistent and often inspired. While the aforementioned bar scene (“Play”) and Peter Pan rehearsal debacle (“The World Is Upside Down”) fizzle, their failure has more to do with their manic staging and clownish acting than a lack of musical grace. Gary Barlow, a former boy band star, and Eliot Kennedy, a songwriter most famous for working with the Spice Girls, pen the songs. Despite the composers’ teen-pop backgrounds, the songs sound more like Oasis and Blur—“What You Mean to Me,” Barrie and Sylvia’s heart wrenching Act II duet, evokes the tight harmonies of the Gallagher brothers on 1995’s “Cast No Shadow.” The first act’s finale (“Hook”), in which Barrie comes up with the Captain Hook villain in a fantasy sequence that presents the pirate as the writer’s id, is similarly strong and reminiscent of Brit Pop.
Much of the effectiveness of the music is attributable to the gorgeous vocals of Jordan and Kelly. Jordan, particularly, is in astonishing form. He floats effortlessly from a crystalline belt into a silky, pure-toned falsetto without any indication of strain or excessive vibrato. Since bursting onto the scene with his central roles in NBC’s “SMASH” and Broadway’s “Newsies,” the latter of which garnered him a Tony nomination, Jordan has become a force to be reckoned with. He matches his powerhouse singing with a spotless Scottish brogue and an affable and honest demeanor that makes him instantly sympathetic. While Kelly’s voice isn’t quite as smooth, she owns the stage and brims with kindness and honesty in “Sylvia’s Lullaby,” her solo about her love for Barrie.
All four of the actors who portray Sylvia’s children are surprisingly authentic: they are shockingly full-voiced and theatrically subtle. Aidan Gemme as Peter, the most precocious child and the most resistant to Barrie and his fantasy worlds, is especially poignant. His voice shakes with a total lack of pretension as he recalls his father’s death and tightens with defiance as he becomes suspicious of Barrie’s happy-go-lucky games. He is a natural talent who will likely receive extensive praise in coming years.
Director Diane Paulus’s ability to keep the frenetic and emotionally fluctuating show together is commendable. Many of the issues that she hasn’t addressed in “Finding Neverland” aren’t structural—the dramatic action unfolds at a satisfying clip. Instead, it’s the sexual fire of the central couple and simplicity of the show that are problematic. While death plays a central role, emotional ambiguity does not—Sylvia and sons take an instant liking to Barrie (and vice versa), and the duo never fights. If the Broadway team tones down some of the more flashy ensemble scenes and injects more realistic chemistry and hesitation into Barrie and Sylvia's relationship, Paulus will have sparked another hit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 4, 1968, a Gilligan’s Island rerun shorted out on my mother’s television screen. The Professor and Mary Ann disappeared, and Walter Cronkite took their place. Stony-faced, he made an announcement: Martin Luther King, Jr., was dead.
A little over 33 years later—and 13 years ago today—on September 11, 2001, the elementary school principal strode into my second-grade class, grave as Cronkite, and whispered in my teacher’s ear. Soon after, we filed into the room next door to hear the news. If we had looked out the window as we passed, we would have seen smoke rising across the Potomac.
My mother was 10 years old when King was shot. When the Pentagon burned and the Twin Towers fell, I was eight.
“Where were you when…?”
Any of my mom’s friends could fill in the blank and answer that question. Any of mine could, too. The events were different, but the feeling was the same—and so is our ability even today narrate that minute, those two minutes, that half an hour, with the kind of clarity that almost always eludes the pre-teen brain. But not that day.
Some of our lucidity comes from the shock of the moment itself. The brain diffuses chemicals throughout our body when something horrible happens (and we knew something horrible had happened, just like we knew we were too young to understand it); the mind makes the memory stick.
We also remember because no one would let us forget.
My mother remembered every time she passed the gutted buildings lining 14th Street in downtown D.C.—a city “too dangerous” for the school bus to drive in and pick her up—or when she saw from her bedroom window the fires raging just blocks away.
And I remembered every time I slipped off my shoes at the airport, every time I saw a yellow ribbon on the bumper of an SUV, and every time I glimpsed the gory gap in the New York skyline from the backseat of my family’s car on I-95. Others weathered pat-downs at those same airports because they were brown, or bore ribbons on their own cars because their siblings fought overseas, or saw something worse than missing buildings because the wounded city—and those who lost their lives there—belonged to them.
A few anniversaries have passed since we stopped holding moments of silence on September 11. Perhaps the wound has lost its rawness. But the scar remains. And even as the date means less and less every year, it’s every day the attack makes a difference. It affects us in ways large and small, practical and emotional. It drew the contours of our childhoods. While it’s up to us fill in the space between those lines, we’ll always remember where we were then: It’s part of who we are now.
What about who we will be? To my kids, September 11 will seem little more than a date in a history book, just like the day of King’s assassination does to me. They’ll learn its significance, but they won’t feel it. All the same, it matters. It matters because, by shaping my mother and her generation, April 4 also shaped me and mine. So did September 1 of 75 years ago, when bells across Europe signaled to my grandmother a world at war once again.
Each of us might remember where we were in one moment, but it’s scores of others that got us there. As today’s world slips further and further into chaos, we ought to take those past moments as lessons. Maybe they can help us make future ones a little less painful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This August, Harvard Yard became tobacco free. Cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and even e-cigarettes are banned—a step up from the existing smoking ban within 25 to 50 feet of any University building. Though well intentioned, the policy will have few additional health benefits while needlessly inconveniencing smokers.
That’s not to imply that tobacco control is unimportant or not needed: Ever since the U.S. Surgeon General released a landmark report conclusively linking smoking to cancer 50 years ago, an aggressive public health campaign to combat tobacco use has saved nearly 8 million lives. A large portion of that success has come from extensive taxation, public awareness campaigns, and indoor smoking bans that limit the destructive effects of secondhand smoke.
The case for intervention is inarguable when the public health benefits are so drastic. Yet the smoking members of the Harvard community do not deserve greater inconvenience when the existing smoking ban already limits most of the damaging effects of smoking—both to passersby and the historic buildings.
Indeed, the College’s exclusion of e-cigarettes tobacco, which does not seem to present the same secondhand smoke risks or problem of discarded butts as traditional cigarettes, indicates that the policy is born out of moral judgment rather than an objective, health-based analysis.
Students are not being inundated with smoke on their treks through the Yard, in part because there are so few students who smoke regularly. A rigid ban would have little marginal impact on the health of the student body compared to strict enforcement of the current regulations of indoor smoking and smoking within 25 feet of any University building, which are reasonable restrictions.
Harvard University Health Services does a commendable job in offering smoking cessation treatment to students, and initiatives like that seem more effective and less intrusive than the Yard’s smoking ban, which was announced over the summer with little warning.
Some infringements on students’ personal liberty serve the greater good, but students who live here ought to be able to exercise their freedoms in their own homes. A Crimson survey found that 13 percent of the Class of 2018 has used tobacco in the past. Tobacco use is an undeniably poor health decision, but the College’s obligation is to the students unintentionally harmed by tobacco smoke and not to regulating the personal lives of smokers.

People often write about how clear the sky was on September 11, 2001. Somehow immortalized despite the passage of 13 years, I know that fact to be true. There was not a cloud in sight to dapple a field of bright blue, and I’ll never forget that. I will never forget how the rumor mill spread like wildfire through a computer class of eight-year-olds. “Somebody blew up the Twin Towers,” one girl whispered to another.
It was the turning point for an entire generation of children. I will never forget how the smoke filled that blue sky as I walked back home down Park Avenue with my parents that morning, and how the sky wouldn’t clear for weeks after.
Most of all, I’ll never forget the state of mourning that my city was plunged into: flags hanging from every surface, funerals my parents attended for months on end, a hole in the skyline that sucked away a vibrant city’s liveliness. When we finally healed again, it was as if the threads of tragedy connected each of the eight million residents to one another.
I am never prouder to be a New Yorker than on September 11 each year. No matter how much time goes by, I am always transported back to third grade and that fateful, cool, and breezy morning. The first time I was ever absent from New York on 9/11—a Tuesday early in my freshman year here at Harvard—my heart filled with ache, and all I wanted to do was be home again. I am rarely an emotional person, but my eyes welled with tears to think of my family, just 200 miles away. The wounds will always be fresh, and two years later, it’s still tough to be in Cambridge on 9/11.
It’s often bothered me that Harvard does so little to remember and acknowledge September 11, but this is not the forum to shame the University. I wish there could be a more formal service for this great community, and that’s all I’ll say on that topic.
Instead, I implore the people around me to take some time today, the congressionally ordained Patriot Day, to give thanks and remember in your own way. No matter if you are in New York, Cambridge, or further afield, there’s always a way to be grateful. We spend many of our days, as Harvard students, being bogged down by meeting after meeting and bemoaning the various stresses in our lives; today is a day to consider something bigger than that.
If you’re reading this early in the day, come join me at Memorial Church at 8:45 a.m. for their morning service. Even if you can’t make it, observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m., the most pregnant pause of the year.
If you’re already not paying attention in class and reading this later on, consider saying a prayer for a lost soul, lighting a candle, and thanking whatever higher power you may believe in.
Don’t be bound by faith. If you eschew organized religion, there are plenty of ways to give back and pay tribute to the fallen thousands. Honor the day and yourself with service, helping those who are less fortunate than you. Take some time for quiet reflection, to stop and think, and to observe the wonderful life that you live.
Most of all, tell the ones around you that you love them and how much they mean to you, and consider just how lucky you are to be alive and free. Call your parents, call your best friend, hug your roommates. Hold them close, and realize that our time on earth is fleeting and far too short.
Today, we can all be New Yorkers—proud, strong, and never forgetting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frustration with Harvard’s efforts to stem the tide of sexual assault is nothing new, but the latest policy, unveiled this past summer, gives students plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Activists have voiced concerns regarding everything from the absence of explicit language enshrining a standard of affirmative consent to a dearth of student involvement, but the real shortcomings are much more systemic than any of these complaints would suggest.
Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s Title IX officer, claimed at a meeting in early September that the “complex” and “nuanced” language of the new sexual assault policy represents one of its great strengths. The fact that a legalistic reading of the policy is required to actually understand its power, however, hints at the bigger issue: not just how students can be expected to interpret the rules, but how violations of the policy will actually be identified by the college.
Under the policy, the newly created Office of Sexual and Gender Based Dispute Resolution, or ODR, will serve as the central investigative body of the university, employing a team of professionals to look into infractions. Various disciplinary boards across the university will then mete out punishment based on the recommendations of the ODR. Little has been said, however, about whether or not the Office of Dispute Resolution is really capable of doing its job.
Three problems immediately come to the fore. First, the necessity of maintaining a full-fledged, full-time investigative body promises to place a significant financial burden on the university. And while Harvard may be able to bear the expense of hiring and training what essentially amounts to a quasi-legal detective agency, whether Harvard’s model will be broadly replicable at less affluent universities is an open question. All students should have equal access to justice, but the quality of in-house investigative bodies would likely vary widely across schools. There are also basic issues of jurisdiction that must be addressed. What if the perpetrator is not affiliated with Harvard—say, a Yale student attending the Harvard-Yale game? Having a double investigative standard for what amounts to a fairly universal crime just doesn’t make sense.
Second, the ODR is not part of the legal establishment. There will be little accountability or transparency, owing to the confidential nature of most investigations. The employees of the ODR will likely not be trained to the same standard as professional police detectives, and they will have no way of independently ushering students who have committed serious crimes into the criminal justice system. Questions of impartiality must also be answered: What happens if the accused is a star athlete? A future Rhodes Scholar? The child of a wealthy benefactor of the university? While our nation’s police forces aren’t necessarily as capable or sensitive as they should be as far as sexual assault is concerned, they are at least independent entities without a stake in the ultimate verdict. Cases of sexual assault cover-ups at other colleges should make us think twice before instituting a system with the potential for serious conflicts of interest.
Finally, while students always have recourse to courts of law, the scope of the ODR’s mission suggests that it is intended to supplant more traditional legal avenues. Sexual assault is a heinous crime, and simply expelling or moving a perpetrator does nothing to protect others from an individual with a demonstrated willingness to commit antisocial acts. Harvard of course has an interest in taking action against students who fail to adhere to its code of conduct, but the university can’t do nearly as much as the legal system when it comes to bringing about justice or protecting survivors and potential victims. It seems highly disingenuous to even suggest that it can.
As a consequence of these flaws, the new sexual assault policy will do little to address what can only be described as a university-wide crisis. It smacks of a meretricious attempt to slap a band-aid on a system that has let down survivors, schools, and society time and again. In an age when roughly a quarter of women and many others experience sexual assault while simply pursuing a college education, a world-class university like ours needs to step up to the plate and admit to the error of its ways. Now is the time for Harvard to live up to its name and lead.

Residents of Tel Aviv have 90 seconds after the alarms sound to locate the nearest public shelter. It happens once a day, maybe twice, timed before the morning or evening news.
The first time the sirens go off, you have just returned from the beach—a first date. You almost miss the last bus of the afternoon for the parting kiss and you jump illegally through the back door; the bus driver does not see you in his rearview mirror. On the bus you sit next to someone you know and you talk about politics; you tell him that in the future you see only hope. You are so angry that he disagrees that when you get off the bus at the same stop you speed up and walk ten steps ahead. It happens while you’re in your apartment, and over the sound of the hairdryer you mistake the rising, high-pitched drone for an ambulance alarm, or nearby construction work.
Remain in the shelter for ten minutes after the alarms cease. Locals say you can leave when you hear “the boom,” the sound of the Iron Dome intercepting missiles overhead. You will see it, once, from the balcony, a condensed stream of bright yellow against the black sky, the way you might have imagined Halley’s Comet.
The second time it happens, you are on the bus, legally this time, on the way to work. The bus driver stops and he and you and the other passengers shuffle into a nearby stairwell, some stranger’s home. There is a plant with browning leaves on the windowsill and the walls are in poor repair; you share the space with a uniformed soldier, another American tourist, and an Israeli couple. You see a cockroach and you scream and jump. The soldier gets ready to step on it but it’s already dead, its large torso nearly broken in two.
In fortified buildings, locate the room on your floor with a number ending in “01.” In unfortified buildings, take shelter in the stairwell. Highway travellers should exit their vehicles and lie down with their heads covered at a distance of 100 meters.
The third time it happens, or maybe the fourth, or the fourteenth—you have lost track by now—it’s 6:30 in the morning and you are alone in the shelter with two Tel Aviv University students who are passionately kissing on the stairs. She has long black hair that obstructs his face; you are wearing pajama shorts and a t-shirt with the name of your freshman dorm across your chest. You wonder whether they’ve just woken up or hadn’t yet gone to bed, and you wonder whether they resent the sirens for interrupting their romance or whether they’re thrilled by the danger.
In between sirens you read the news; you download the RedAlert app and it rings every time a siren goes off somewhere in Israel—this becomes so bothersome that you eventually delete it. You view photos of devastation in Gaza on CNN and the BBC sites; later you find out that some of the BBC photos are miscaptioned images from Iraq and Syria, but the eyes of a dead Palestinian boy are real. You read a thousand op-eds decrying these actions and another thousand defending them. You read a thousand inaccurate statistics and biased narratives, and everywhere you go the news plays on a TV in the background; you do not speak the language but there is a certain rhythm to the spaces between the few words you understand; “Hamas,” “Netanyahu,” “Ashkelon.”
Walk--don’t run--to your designated shelter. In the South, an old woman overexerts herself and dies of a heart attack. The French customers at your favorite café will slouch in, their cigarette smoke filling the small space, eerily like the aftermath of an explosion.
A few days before you leave the country, it happens while you’re in 301 with a friend, so you just stay seated on her couch while she fills two glasses of water from the kitchen sink. She works at a camp for children with cerebral palsy. Some of the children there cannot speak, and they have tablets that can play various sound effects. Over and over for the past month, she tells you as she balances the lukewarm glass between her knees, the youngest children have been using the effect that sounds like a high-pitched siren, the kind you might mistake for an ambulance alarm.
At home, when your friends ask, “What was it like?” you do not know how to respond. You read a New York Times story about a young Palestinian runner in training for the 2016 Olympics, his home, his shoes, his trophies destroyed by Israeli fire. You read an Atlantic article about anti-Israel protesters in Germany shouting “Jews to the gas!”
One day you are sitting at the desk in your dorm room, and you hear a loud, rising, high-pitched noise. This time, it is an ambulance alarm or construction work, but without thinking you feel yourself rising a little from your chair, waiting to hear “the boom.”

When Aubrey J. Walker ’15 first heard that an unarmed black youth about to begin college had been shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., he was finishing up an internship in policy research and preparing to head back to Harvard to complete his degree in Human Evolutionary Biology.
“I had kind of bought into this narrative that if I could achieve this level of respectability, that if I studied and worked hard enough my life would be worth something,” he remembers thinking.
This summer, the now-infamous shooting of Michael Brown, and the subsequent brutal crackdown on protests in Ferguson launched a nationwide trial of racialized character, pitting a vision of a friendly, college-bound teenager against a vision of a threatening convenience store robber.
Walker sat down with fellow Harvard seniors Temitope Agabalogun, Amanda D. Bradley, and Fadhal A. Moore in the Eliot House dining hall last Friday to discuss why neither of these narratives should matter.
“Why should it be ‘Oh, he was going to college in a few days,’ versus ‘Oh, he was going to rob a store?’” asked Moore. “Either way, it doesn’t matter—extrajudicial killings are not allowed in this country.”
The four seniors, who had all served as leaders of the black Harvard community in organizations like the Association of Black Harvard Women, the Black Men’s Forum, and the Freshman Black Table, began discussing these issues in an e-mail thread over the summer . The discussion launched plans for a mass incarceration policy group at the Harvard Institute of Politics, a Tumblr blog about the issue, and a solidarity event on Harvard’s campus (Black Men’s Forum current president, Rodriguez A. Roberts ’15, also played a large part in these efforts). The event, which took place on Widener Library’s steps last Sunday, brought nearly 200 black Harvard students dressed in school paraphernalia to pose with their hands up in a group photograph.
The students’ clothing, the organizers explained, was intended to critique the idea that black students should have to use their Harvard status—or other symbols of success and respectability—to prove their right to live.
“I’ve heard of [black students] flashing their Harvard IDs when they get pulled over on the road—they keep it under their licenses,” said Moore. “There’s always a need, given our perceptions of the way authorities see us, to change the way we interact with them.”
Bradley, who grew up in Atlanta, Georgia, remembers how differently police officers treated her from the other black youths in her neighborhood.
“I went to a private Catholic school, so I wore a uniform, and often I’d be walking home from school and the police would basically be harassing kids on my street,” she recalls. “I’d walk up speaking the King’s English and they’d be very nice to me—they’d speak to me as a human being.”
Even on Harvard’s campus, black students have had to “prove” their right to be present in certain spaces. In 2007, when two black student groups held a barbeque on the Quad lawn, a passerby called the police, who asked attendees to show identification. In 2009, the arrest of Harvard African American studies professor Henry Louis Gates for “breaking” into his own apartment made national news.
These incidents and others were addressed by last year’s “I, Too, Am Harvard” campaign, which criticized an institutional culture that can make black students feel marginalized or alienated.
But while that campaign targeted conceptions of what it means to belong at Harvard, Agabalogun, Bradley, Moore, and Walker, are now hoping to move the discussion toward the legitimacy that should be based on natural rights alone.
“Now it’s ‘I Too Am Human,’” said Moore.
The organizers also hope to effect change in the national discussion of incidents like the shootings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. “In America, we typically try to walk around these problems without addressing race, without addressing black people as victims,” explained Agabalogun.
In addition to the IOP policy group, the organizers discussed plans to launch discussions with advocacy groups at other universities, with the goal of encouraging students across the nation to contact their state senators and representatives.
“What’s seductive about respectability politics is the idea of free will and individual agency,” explained Walker. “But we’re battling entire structures. We need to organize among our groups and communities, look at statewide and nationwide policy.”
For Agabalogun, Bradley, Moore, and Walker, countering the notion that success can be equated with the right to live is both essential and deeply personal.
“My brother is a high-school dropout,” said Bradley. “If he got shot, would we talk about his death differently?"

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 11, 2014, at 9:45 p.m.
Nearly 12 percent of Harvard College is enrolled in a single course, according to data released by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office on Wednesday.
The course, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” attracted a record-breaking 818 undergraduates this semester, marking the largest number in the course’s 30-year history and the largest class offered at the College in the last five years, according to the Registrar’s website. Including non-College students, the enrollment number totals 875.
Last fall, about 700 students enrolled in the course, placing it second only to Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics,” which drew 764 students. This fall, Economics 10a is the second largest course, enrolling 711 total students.
CS50 instructor, David J. Malan ’99, and other computer science professors said that the boost in enrollment stems from increasing Harvard-wide and nation-wide interest in computer science.
“Harvard students are smart people,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of the College and current director of undergraduate studies for Computer Science. “They have figured out that in pretty much every area of study, computational methods and computational thinking are going to be important to the future.”
Lewis postulated that his course this semester, Computer Science 121: “Introduction to the Theory of Computation,” enrolled more students than it ever had before: 153. The number of Computer Science concentrators at the College has increased each year for the past five years, from 86 in 2008 to 153 in 2013.
Malan also said that “it is possible” that the decision to exempt CS50 from the new restrictions on enrollment in courses occurring at the same time helped bolster its enrollment numbers. Last month, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris sent an email to course instructors notifying them of tighter controls on simultaneous enrollment for all courses except CS50.
Malan said that simultaneous enrollment data will not be available until he surveys his students later this week, but that the course typically attracts around 100 students who enroll in another course that meets at an overlapping time.
Computer Science associate professor Eddie Kohler said CS50’s increasing popularity also speaks to the structure and accessibility of the course.
“It’s an experience, it’s not even a course exactly,” Kohler said. “That’s part of what [Malan’s] goal was, to bring the content to as many people as possible.”
Ninety-one students enrolled in CS50 this semester opted to take the course sat/unsat, similar to last fall. The sat/unsat option, an alternative to taking a course pass/fail, allows students to earn either a grade of “Satisfactory,” for letter grades from A to C-, or a grade of “Unsatisfactory,” which is considered a failing grade.
While one less student than in 2013 opted to take CS50 sat/unsat by the time study cards were due on Tuesday, Malan said he would “be thrilled” if more students chose to take CS50 sat/unsat.
“I think for as long as I can remember there’s never really been a culture at Harvard of taking courses pass/fail and exploring unfamiliar fields,” Malan said. “I think that’s unfortunate.”
Malan himself said he elected to take CS50 pass/fail in 1996.
“[Sat/unsat] is a wonderful mechanism for empowering students and giving students confidence for taking what otherwise may be a daunting class,” he said.

CORRECTION: September 11, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that this semester's offering of CS 50: "Introduction to Computer Science I" is the highest enrolled class at the College in the last decade. In fact, at 818 undergraduates, it is the largest in the last five years, but not the last ten.

Mathew Martoma, a former student at Harvard Law School and a SAC Capital Advisors portfolio manager, was sentenced to nine years in prison and required to forfeit $9.4 million in earnings for his role in “the most lucrative insider trading scheme ever charged,” according to Manhattan District Attorney Preet Bharara '91.
Legal proceedings last winter uncovered that Martoma was expelled from the Law School after forging his transcript in the hopes of receiving one of the coveted federal court clerkships. Following his expulsion, Martoma changed his name and gained entrance to Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, yet his degree was revoked by Stanford following the revelations of the case earlier this year.
Martoma and colleagues received insider information from two doctors on an Alzheimer’s disease drug produced by pharmaceutical companies Elan and Wyeth, and used the information to amass $275 million in profits and avoided losses, according to the federal complaint.
SAC Capital Advisors, a hedge fund started by Steven A. Cohen, was also required to pay $1.2 billion for securities fraud to the Securities and Exchange Commission and prohibited from handling outsiders’ money. Cohen, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be about $9 billion, has renamed SAC Capital to Point72 Asset Management and retooled the hedge fund to handle only his personal wealth.
Administrators and faculty from the Law School declined to comment on the case, as they have done throughout the legal proceedings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Harvard Faculty for Divestment called once again for an open and public forum with members of the Harvard Corporation and the Harvard Management Company in a letter to Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 on Tuesday.
The letter marked the latest instance of communication in the debate over the University’s stance on divestment from fossil fuels between members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—and the group, which currently consists of more than 150 faculty members from across Harvard’s schools.
The latter has repeatedly requested to discuss the matter in a meeting with the Corporation and HMC, as well as the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility. To date, no such meeting has taken place.
“Leadership is not only about doing something the right way; that is simply conventional good management,” the letter to Lee, which was published Tuesday on the group’s website, reads. “Leadership is, ultimately, about doing the right thing.”
In defense of the University’s official position against divestment, Lee wrote to faculty members in July that Harvard retains greater ability to influence the actions of those companies in which it has shares. He also outlined several measures the University is taking to improve sustainability on campus.
But in Tuesday’s letter in response to Lee’s communication, faculty members alleged that the University has not exercised this ability.
“Harvard in 2012-13 voted against a proposal that would have compelled Chevron to report on climate change and against another that required Chevron to include an environmental expert on its Board,” the letter reads. “Harvard abstained on a vote to compel Chevron to report on oil well risks; and it voted against requiring Chevron and ExxonMobil to end their political spending, including spending aimed at voters in political elections.”
In a statement to Harvard Magazine on Tuesday, Lee did not reply directly to the signatories’ allegations, but said the Corporation “will review this message, just received today, carefully. We have learned a lot from members of the faculty, who have a broad range of views on this issue,  and look forward to continuing to do so.”
Harvard Faculty for Divestment has requested a meeting with University President Drew G. Faust and plans on holding a forum on Oct. 26 with faculty presentations on institutional divestment. Atmospheric Chemistry professor James G. Anderson, English and Comparative Literature professor James T. Engell '73, and History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes will be among the speakers.
In addition to the letter, Harvard Faculty for Divestment has expanded the ad hoc group of about half a dozen faculty members who lead the body to 16 professors from eight of Harvard’s faculties.
The written dialogue between the group and the administration began with a letter last April calling for divestment that was signed by more than 100 faculty members. In response, Faust said she planned on arranging for a “thoughtful exchange” on climate change with faculty members this fall, though she said she would not hold an open meeting with the Corporation and members of the pro-divestment activist group Divest Harvard.
Since the back-and-forth started last spring, faculty members in the group have insisted that Harvard must divest from fossil fuels, or risk “a future of potentially catastrophic change that will most emphatically not be of our choosing.”

UPDATED: September 11, 2014, at 11:35 a.m.
Harvard Business School alumni are still pessimistic about the American economy, according to a new report from the school entitled “An Economy Doing Half Its Job.”
The report, which was written by Business School professors Michael E. Porter and Jan W. Rivkin and released Monday, highlighted a “troubling divergence” in the U.S. economy, where large firms have recovered from the economic recession and highly-skilled workers are prospering, but small businesses and working-class citizens continue to be in distress.
“A lot of the confusion in the public discourse [about U.S. competitiveness] starts at the definition,” Rivkin said. “When we say the U.S. is competitive, we mean that firms here can do two crucial things: win in the global marketplace but also lift the living standards of the average American citizen.”
Only 33 percent of survey respondents were optimistic about U.S. competitiveness, while 47 percent, a plurality of respondents, said they expect U.S. competitiveness to deteriorate. The remaining 20 percent expected the conditions to remain the same.
These numbers have declined from previous years, where survey numbers reflected that 71 percent and 58 percent of respondents, respectively, expected U.S. competitiveness to decline in future surveys.
Survey participants where asked, “how can we create a U.S. economy in which firms both thrive in global competition and lift the living standards of the average American?”
The results identified three general areas of weakness where improvements might lead to increased competitiveness for U.S. firms: K-12 education, workplace skills, and transportation infrastructure. These areas are consistent with the responses of surveyed alumni, who felt that the aforementioned areas were crucial to the growth and development of middle- and working-class citizens.
“Without an educated populace and a pool of skilled labors the firms here will suffer,” Rivkin said.
Respondents were more positive about other areas of the U.S. economy.
“They saw strengths in aspects that influence company success, such as the quality of management, the vibrancy of capital markets, and firm access to innovation,” according to the report.
Rivkin noted that many firms are making efforts to compensate for their weaknesses by investing in mutually beneficial resources that both workers and firms need to be competitive, such as education partnerships.
“Business leaders are recognizing their interests in the commons,” Rivkin said. “They do it not just out of patriotism or altruism, but out of pure interest.” He emphasized that the U.S. economy is at a crossroads, where decisions should be made to address the existing structural weaknesses, despite signs of recovery.
“Will we as a society now sigh in relief and continue business as usual?” the report asks. “Or will we seize the opportunity to repair the structural weaknesses in our economy?”
With the help of the research firm Abt SRBI, Rivkin and Porter surveyed 1,947 HBS alumni from 46 U.S states and 72 foreign countries. This is the third version of the survey, which was previously conducted in 2011 and 2012, with the purpose of gauging the outlook of business leaders in regard to U.S. competitiveness.

Houghton Library celebrated the opening of a new exhibit, “InsideOUT Contemporary Bindings of Private Press Books,” at an event on Wednesday evening. Harvard Library officials also took the opprotunity to introduce Tom Hyry, Houghton's new chief librarian.
The exhibit, which is making its first U.S. appearance at Houghton, features works created by both American and British binders. It opened in the United Kingdom over the summer and will leave Harvard on Dec. 13, when it goes to Minneapolis, New York, and later San Francisco.
“Not only are they beautiful bindings, but they go around very significant publications,” said Simon D. Eccles, a collector who initially conceived the idea for the exhibit. “These are very serious works of art.”
Eccles, whose family donated the Hyde collection to the Houghton, began the process of creating the exhibit when he approached Designer Bookbinders, a British bookbinding society, with the idea more than two years ago.
Fellows from Designer Bookbinders, including Lester P. Capon, helped curate the exhibit. As one of the co-curators, Capon set up the displays of the books in the Edison and Newman Room in the Houghton. Capon’s own binding of “CIRCUS: The Artist as Saltimbanque” is shown in the exhibit alongside the works of other fellows of the society and those of their American colleagues.
Excerpts from the texts on display hang on the walls of the showcase room—a feature unique to this exhibit. According to Eccles, the excerpts help viewers better understand how the binding complements the text. The exhibit also displays multiple bindings of the same text. Different bindings of the Brothers Grimm’s “Fairy Tales” and Thomas Jefferson’s “Paris Walks” show the audience the many ways a binder can approach his or her work.
Amidst the collection of contemporary bindings, Vice president of the Harvard Library Sarah E. Thomas introduced Hyry as the new Florence Fearrington librarian of Houghton Library.
“I’m terribly excited that Tom is here because I think that we have similar ambitions to open up the special collections for use for students whether it’s for students in a class, for faculty, or for HarvardX,” Thomas said.
Hyry comes from the University of California, Los Angeles where he served as the director of special collections. At Harvard, he will continue work in acquisition, curatorship, and outreach at Houghton.
“I’m conscious that I’m standing on the shoulders of important people that came before me,” Hyry said. “The trick is to take the great work that they have done and carry it forward to try some new methods to connect these resources to new generations of scholars and students.”

All Harvard Houses will begin implementing inter-House restrictions for Thursday "Community Night" dinners, the Office of Student Life said Wednesday evening, two weeks after the start of the new school year.
The new policy, which is slated to take effect today, was announced in an email sent to the student body by Dean of the Office of Student Life Stephen Lassonde.
“There is a sense among the Masters as a group that the leadership across the College could do more to enhance students’ sense of belonging at Harvard,” Lassonde wrote in a follow-up email to The Crimson. “All of us: masters, deans, tutors and proctors, and those of us in the Dean’s Office are aware of a kind of centripetal force pulling all of you away toward other concerns and commitments from the moment you arrive here.”
The idea of restricted community dinners is not new to the Houses. However, the dinners were usually staggered on different days of the week. With the change, students will no longer be allowed to eat dinner in a House other than their own on Thursdays.
According to Lassonde, the change was agreed upon in “an effort to limit any confusion” and provide Houses with a designated day on which to host their special dinners.
Lassonde also admitted that these changes do “restrict choice and convenience” but added that these problems are easily solvable.
“It may mean that you have to plan a little better on Thursday evenings,” Lassonde said. “But remember...the restriction ends across the College at seven, so one could eat anywhere by seven.”
Lassonde added that Mather House is now open for dinner until 8 p.m. on Thursdays and that Quad House dining halls will remain open until 7:30 p.m.
Representatives from the Undergraduate Council were skeptical about the new development.
“I've always felt that passing restrictions that limit behavior is not the way to build true community—it has to come from within, from positive reinforcement, from actively bringing communities together,” UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 wrote in an email. “It also makes student meetings or get-togethers over dinner almost impossible to do on Thursdays. Student groups or study groups that have met over dinner on Thursdays in the past will be unable to do so now. In that sense, the restrictions will actually inconvenience student life.”
“I'm not convinced that these community nights actually foster community in any meaningful way,” UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 added.
Some students said they worry that the change could negatively affect students living in the Quad.
“I understand...why it could be a good idea for the Houses,” said Taikye Wright-Brown ‘16, a Cabot resident. “But I also do believe that it’s slightly inconvenient for students who may have lab, sections, or other responsibilities that they have to take care of that require them to be near the River Houses around dinner time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kimberly Theidon, a former associate professor who previously alleged Harvard violated Title IX in denying her tenure in May 2013, has withdrawn her complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination with intent to file a lawsuit against the University, her lawyer said Tuesday.
Theidon’s original complaint alleged that the University’s tenure decision was made to punish her for exercising free speech protected under Title IX. Her lawyer, Philip J. Gordon, said that complaint was a formality necessary to pursue legal action.
“Filing at the state fair employment agency is required prior to filing a state employment discrimination or retaliation claim or a federal Title VII employment discrimination claim,” Gordon wrote in a follow-up email on Wednesday.
He said that Theidon and her legal team have yet to determine where they will file the lawsuit. Though the specific allegation has not yet been finalized, he said the team would “very likely accuse the University of violating Title IX and violating Title VII.”
Theidon held the title John J. Loeb Associate Professor of the Social Sciences, an endowed position, before her contract expired in June. The contract’s expiration ended her formal relationship with the University.
Theidon alleges Harvard was eager to cut ties with her because she had evidence of the University’s lack of compliance with Title IX. She said she had been given indication that she was a strong tenure candidate, though the tenure review process is strictly confidential.
Especially influential in the University’s decision, she alleges, was consideration of comments she posted in March 2013 in response to a Crimson article about sexual assault at Harvard. In her comments, Theidon offered a defense of the anonymous sexual assault victims quoted in the story and argued with commenters who self-identified as “men’s rights” activists.
Theidon told The Crimson in April that before commenting, she learned that women interviewed for the article had seen the comments attacking their claims of sexual assault, leaving them feeling “violated all over again.”
This action, combined with other instances of advocacy, such as providing counsel to a student who told her that a male faculty member had sexually harassed her, led the University to deny her tenure two months later, she alleges.
University spokesperson Jeff Neal on Wednesday reiterated the University’s earlier statements that its tenure decision was based purely on academic merit.
“Dr. Theidon’s central claims that inappropriate judgments affected her tenure decision continue to be flatly wrong,” Neal wrote. “There is no merit whatsoever to her allegations of discrimination or retaliation. Any advocacy on Dr. Theidon’s part on behalf of victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault was not known, let alone considered, as part of the University’s decision on her tenure case.”
Theidon challenged the University’s initial tenure decision, filing an appeal in August 2013. During the spring semester, she was notified that the decision had been upheld in an investigatory process she said she believes had “zero transparency.” She said the investigation delivered no justification or explanation for the decision.
“She was told that it would be futile to file her appeal. And it was,” Gordon said, calling the decision a “rubber stamp” on the University's original decision.
Theidon filed a complaint with MCAD in late March, before she learned of the verdict on her appeal. On July 9, Theidon and her lawyers withdrew the complaint to prepare for legal action.
Gordon said that exactly when Theidon’s case will move forward has yet to be determined.
In the meantime, Theidon is working in Washington, D.C., through a fellowship with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, where she is writing a book entitled “Speaking of Silences: Gender, Violence and Reparations” as well as a series of articles based on her work in Colombia.
When the fellowship ends in 2015, Theidon will move back to the Boston area, this time as a professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Democracy. Theidon will very likely enter the university in a tenure-track position, Gordon said.
“One way in which [academics denied tenure] are damaged…is they move to another institution. And they don’t move with tenure, because they don’t have tenure,” he said.
Theidon maintained that her action against the University is meant not only to vindicate her own allegations, but to end the “pattern of retaliation against faculty who speak up” at Harvard and at other universities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off one of the most successful seasons in program history, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams, led by ninth-year Crimson coach Jason Saretsky, enter a new season with the hopes of improving even further despite the loss of some key runners.
Last season proved to be a breakout year for the team, as the men qualified to the NCAA National Championships for the first time in 35 years. The women, meanwhile, had a strong season including a third-place finish at Hep, where the squad just missed the cut for Nationals. Both teams also spent time throughout the season ranked in the top-30 USTFCCCA poll.
The team took a hit with the losses of important athletes such as Morgan Kelley ’14 on the women’s side as well as James Leakos ’14 and the NCAA Nationals third place finisher in Maksim Korolev ’14 on the men’s side.
Even without some of last year’s top runners, captain Will Geiken believes that many on the team have the ability to step up this upcoming season to claim the spots left behind by their former teammates.
“We have a number of runners who weren’t in the top seven last year who will probably be contributors,” Geiken said. “Having a number of guys like that, [we’re] feeling good, we’re excited with what we can do.”
The burden of replacing such talent appears to be aided by the return of several experienced members on both sides of the team.
For the men, Geiken and junior teammate Tom Purcell, who finished third and second respectively for the Crimson at NCAAs, lead a group of athletes who looks to finish races with a smaller time difference within the top five Harvard runners in order to have a better team finish.
“We’re trying to move the entire top five scoring group up in the field,” Geiken said. “To counter the loss of Maks and James upfront, we want runners numbers three, four and five to be near the front of the race with our one and two.”
The female side follows a similar trend, with top runner and senior Viviana Hanley returning to lead the team alongside fellow classmates and captains Alaina Alvarez and Jennifer Guidera.
The Harvard women look to make it back to Nationals after missing out the past season by just one spot. Saretsky believes that both teams can build on what was a great season and achieve their expectations of reaching Nationals.
“Both teams are in very similar spots,” Saretsky said. “We return a number of outstanding student-athletes, we got some great new additions with the freshman class, and we’re fired up and excited for the season to get underway.”
The Crimson also looks to benefit from the addition of a strong freshman class, as both the women and men added strong, fast runners who look to contribute right away.
New runners must make the often difficult transition from high school, where the 5-kilometer race is the distance of choice in cross country, to college, where the men run the 5K and 10K races, while the women run the 6K.
Like all new collegiate athletes, the freshmen make the change while also adjusting to college life. Though the switch isn’t always instantaneous and new athletes can take some time before being contributors to the team via low times and finishes, the runners still look to make the most of the new experience.
“We might have a few more female student athletes contributing in our top seven sooner than the men,” Saretsky said. “But both groups are really talented, they’ve got great attitudes, great work ethic [and] really fit into the culture that we’ve been working hard to cultivate here.”
With a NCAA Championship berth and an Ivy League title in play, the Crimson will kick off its season against Ancient Eight rivals Princeton and Yale on September 12th.

The Harvard co-ed sailing team begins its year-long season this weekend with four regattas taking place, two of which will take place on home waters.
According to Sailing World’s April 2014 rankings, the Crimson's co-ed crew is ranked 13th nationally. No. 2 Yale will be hosting the Harry Anderson Trophy. No. 6 Tufts will be hosting the Central Series 1 Regatta and MIT, tabbed one seed below Harvard, will be hosting the Toni Deutsch Trophy.
Last year at the Harry Anderson Trophy down in New Haven, the Crimson finished in second place to start off the 2013-2014 season.
“We have been prepping for this week’s regattas by being on the water and in the weight room as much as possible since being back on campus,” junior captain Sydney Karnovsky said. “Hopefully we will be able to repeat or improve on our performance at this regatta.”
This weekend will bring with it Harvard’s first of three home regattas in the fall.
“We are excited to get our season going this weekend,” Karnovsky said. “We are coming into this year a bit older and more experienced than we have been the last two years, and we are looking forward to having a strong season.”
Last spring, the Crimson ended the season with an appearance at the ICSA college sailing nationals after failing to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Championship in the fall.
“We ended last year by qualifying for [nationals] and, unfortunately, finish[ed] in 18th (out of the 18 that qualified),” Karnovsky said. “Making nationals was a big step forward for us last year, but this year we are looking forward to up our game even more, and hopefully achieve consistent top 10 finishes in our regattas.”
This time last year, Harvard’s roster comprised of mostly freshmen and sophomores. With those sailors one year older, the Crimson is hoping that the added experience will work in its favor as the team hits the water again this weekend. Additionally, a major challenge that arose last spring was the series of unpredictable and harsh weather conditions that kept the squad off the water longer than its competition after winter break, and therefore left Harvard with a greater deficit in exposure compared to its competition when it came to regattas.
Last season, several Harvard sailors believed their biggest weakness on the water came with their starts in regattas.
The late summer sunshine has allowed ample practice time already for this challenge to be tackled.
Returning this year are a few sailors who had standout performances last season. Jacob Bradt '16 was named an All-American crew in the spring, and he will continue to sail with his regular partner, Brian Drumm '15, who was named an All-NEISA Second Team Skipper in the spring.
“A big part of what is going to go into [this season] is to produce continuous self-assessment and critique without overloading ourselves with too much pressure if a couple of races don't go our way,” Drumm said. "This is what will keep [Bradt] and I focused as we continue building upon our skills to outdo the competition.”
Last year, as a freshman, Juan Perdomo took second place in the country in the men’s singlehanded national championship regatta that will take place again in the fall.
With these challenges in the past, focus recharged for the future, and the leadership of a few stand-out returners, Harvard gears up for the new season with new goals.
“This fall, our hope is to qualify for the Atlantic Coast Championships and perform well there,” Karnovksy said. “I think that one major goal we will work on to help us qualify for ACCs is consistency. On any given day, we can perform as well as just about any other team in college sailing, but we have struggled a lot with consistent performances across the board.”

Senior Wesley Saunders will enter the 2014-2015 men’s basketball season with higher expectations than ever.
The defending Ivy League Player of the Year was named the 34th-best player in the nation by USA Today’s Jason McIntyre this summer, directly behind Kentucky’s Aaron Harrison and Gonzaga’s Kevin Pangos. Saunders averaged 14.2 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 3.8 assists for the Crimson last year while serving as the team’s best wing defender.
A year after two of his former teammates—Kyle Casey ’13-’14 and Brandyn Curry ’13-’14—signed with European professional basketball teams, McIntyre opines that Saunders may have a chance to make the NBA. He wrote that the senior from Windward High School will “get a long look as a pro next year” and suggests he might be a second round pick.
Per RealGM.com, Saunders would be the first Crimson player drafted since 1987, when Keith Webster was drafted in the seventh round. The NBA shifted to a two-round draft in 1989, so if Saunders were drafted at all it would make him the highest draft pick in Crimson history—a record currently held by 1973 fourth-round draft pick James Brown.
USA Today did not rank the Crimson among the top 25 preseason teams, however.

Two years after leaving the Harvard men’s basketball team, Ugo Okam ’14 has transferred to Bethune-Cookman. Okam graduated Harvard last year but was granted extended athletic eligibility and will be eligible to play basketball immediately after enrolling in Bethune-Cookman’s graduate program, the school announced Tuesday.
Okam joined Harvard in 2010 as a two-star recruit coming out of Monteverde Academy—the first of three players to come from Monteverde to Harvard over the next five seasons. He played in 14 contests as a freshman, highlighted with a six-point, three-block effort in a Nov. 17 game against Holy Cross.
The center played in only three games his sophomore year and left the team his junior season. Okam told The Daytona Beach News-Journal that after leaving the team he continued to practice with Harvard coaches and played summer league basketball.
Okam is not the first player to obtain an extra year of eligibility after leaving Harvard—where the College’s eight-semester rule precludes athletes from staying on campus extra years, as is possible at other Division I universities. Andrew Van Nest ’12 went to Boston College following his four years at Harvard, appearing in 25 games and making three starts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of this column, you will understand why the Ivy League schedule is going to change, and why I have to start by talking about pre-term planning.
The tool that tries men’s souls, a Cthulhu-like nightmare worthy of True Detective, pre-term planning has no proper historical or cultural precedent. Except maybe Frankenstein’s monster, since Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris called the program “horrible” two years after witnessing its profane creation
But what does this have to do with sports? I’ll get there.
Despite the horrors, pre-term planning retains one redeeming quality (in addition to accurately predicting the enrollment for many courses): it makes an easy topic of dining hall conversation.
Students and faculty come together over a shared love of hating the system. They discuss how it distorts the TF hiring process, bewitches professors, and ensnares students in overcrowded lecture halls. Then, like the preteens we all are deep inside, they chatter about how they would fix the bad boy if only they could control it.
Selecting a course pre-term should give you a leg-up if it has a lottery during shopping week…. You should be able to add a degree of confidence with each selection…. Just create a model for course growth based on past enrollment, for Pete’s sake.
Pre-term planning is not the dining hall sage’s only area of expertise, of course. Listen long enough and you will hear all of their other quick-fix suggestions in due time.
Life would be easier for everyone if we could order grill items from our phones…. Professors should just give students a one-minute break to respond to emails and texts midway through class…. Why can’t Harvard figure out weekend shuttle service?
OK, so what does this all have to do with Harvard Athletics? Well, that exact same type of creative chatter is taking place in Ivy football circles concerning the league’s scheduling policies.
During last month’s preseason teleconference, Princeton coach Bob Surace suggested the league’s eight teams be divided into two divisions, with the winners playing in a championship game and one of them advancing to the FCS Playoffs.
The Daily Pennsylvanian joined the discussion earlier this month, with writer Steven Tydings opining for the conference to start play earlier.
Starting the season a week earlier would ensure warmer weather for the first night game, capitalize on back-to-school fan enthusiasm, and allow students to go to more games before their workloads reach cruising altitude.
Shifting the schedule would also mean inserting a bye week in the middle of the slate, as most other college and professional teams do. Adding a week off would fit perfectly with the conference’s stated priority regarding safety and health.
Harvard should also be able to play in the FCS playoffs, especially now that the league and the University are making broadcasting deals with ESPN and NBC Sports. It is unfair of the conference to use the students for nationally televised marketing while claiming, “Postseason play would undermine the student identity of our student-athletes,” as University President Drew G. Faust did in 2012.
I should add that the quote only applies to football players, in case you were confused about all the other Harvard athletes who are allowed to win national championships.
But I digress.
League insiders’ various suggestions aren’t important here; what is important is that the discussion is being had. Let’s go back to pre-term planning for a second.
PTP and other Harvard inanities make common topics of conversation because Harvard students like to complain and look smart, but the biggest factor is that nearly everyone agrees there is an underlying issue. You would be less likely to criticize PTP at dinner if you thought your friends might throw swai at you for disparaging what they consider to be a perfect tool.
Conversation normally focuses on whether there is a problem, except when everyone agrees that one exists.
I’m not being radical when I put forward the syllogism: a) There must be a consensus problem for conversation to be dominated by discussion of solutions b) The only conversations regarding the Ivy football schedule regard potential changes, and therefore c) The league’s schedule is accepted as flawed.
But it does not have to be. In recent years, the University has altered its academic calendar and tweaked pre-term planning after a groundswell of grumbling from armchair administrators. In football scheduling, some changes are already coming.
Dartmouth will play New Hampshire for the first time in five years this season. Yale will play Army for the first time since 1996. Princeton will travel to San Diego, leaving its region for the first time in years, and Harvard will play in Washington, D.C., against Georgetown.
With an influx of new athletic directors around the league and reinvigorated discussions being had, bigger changes could come soon.
Sliding the schedule forward might benefit Ivy newspaper columnists most of all. They would no longer have to make contrived comparisons regarding pre-term planning and Ivy schedules during the second week of September.
They could make them about football teams instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s volleyball (2-1, 0-0 Ivy) has traveled Athens, Ga., to take part in this weekend’s Benson Hospitality Invitational and face some high quality opposition from the South. The team is riding high after its strong showing on its home floor at the Harvard Invitational last weekend, and will look to carry that momentum forward as the competition heats up.
Up first on Friday, the team will suit up against North Carolina State (5-1, 0-0 ACC). The Wolfpack is an ACC stalwart that at one point held an 11-4 record in conference play last season and looked ready to challenge on the national stage, before dropping the last five games of the season and moving out of title contention.
The squad has shrugged off that disappointing end to the season and started strongly thus far, racking up five wins already, led by opposite hitter Rachel Buckley. The senior from Texas has been in imperious form, using all of her 74 inches to rain down 74 kills in only six games, at a remarkable .293 clip.
The task of keeping Buckley at bay for the Crimson could fall to defensive specialist Sindhu Vegesena. The senior libero had a breakout performance last weekend with 65 digs in all, including a monster performance against Central Connecticut State with a career high 34 digs. Replicating that performance this weekend could be key for Harvard.
Saturday brings a doubleheader, beginning with Georgia (4-2, 0-0 SEC). The tournament hosts will bring a rowdy crowd to the game and will be hoping to ride that advantage to victory this weekend. Fresh off a 3-0 performance and victory in last week’s Georgia Invitational, the team has dominated on its home court.
A big part of the Bulldogs’ success has been the play of redshirt sophomore Desiree Macray. The Columbia, S.C. native was named SEC defensive player of the week after racking up ten blocks in the tournament. She was also pretty handy on the offensive side of the ball, with a very nifty .333 hitting percentage over the weekend, including a .462 clip against Belmont.
Harvard’s offense was balanced in its first weekend of play, with five players racking up over 20 kills each, and will have to be humming to get past Georgia. The Bulldogs bring size and digging to the court, and can steamroll teams if they get going, snapping their opponents out of any defensive rhythm. The Crimson’s versatility on offense could be useful here as it could prove troubling for the home team to extinguish all of Harvard’s various attacking options.
Indeed, the team’s camaraderie across the board has been a strength for the Crimson, according to sophomore Whitney Hansen.
“I think our biggest strength that we always appreciate the most is our team chemistry,” Hansen said. “I guess that’s a little sappy, but we all get along really, really well on and off the court, so I think that helps us out in tight spots.”
Nonetheless, a large part of the attacking burden will fall on junior Kathleen Wallace. The outside hitter spearheaded the Crimson last year with 217 kills overall and with another year of experience under her belt, could be even more dangerous this season.
Last up for Harvard will be UNC Asheville (2-5, 0-0 BS). The Bulldogs do not quite carry the same firepower as the other two teams and have struggled at the beginning of the season. Its fortunes do appear to be on the rise, though, as the team carries a two-game winning streak into the weekend, after a 3-0 thrashing of local rivals North Carolina Central on Tuesday.
The Crimson has never faced any of these teams before in competition and will be facing a higher level of competition than it usually faces in Ivy play. It’s time for the big leagues, and the team is ready to step up to the plate.
Co-captain Kristen Casey is looking forward to the challenge.
“These are some of the toughest teams we’ll play all season for sure,” Casey said. “I think we’re really excited about having such a high level of competition. If we win that’s great, and if we don’t, there’s still last week to build from.”

In 2005, University President Larry Summers took a night off to “gyrate” with freshmen in Annenberg, for seemingly no reason at all.
“I love Larry,” said Dara E. Blume ’08. “He’s the man”—(who’s good at math and science)—”and very fashionable—I would almost go for sexy.” What’s holding you back, Dara? Seems like you said it. We want to start a petition, nine years too late, to get back at all those who objectified Larry.
It appears Larry got down to many tunes such as Bootylicious by Beyoncé. “Now I can say that ‘Bootylicious’ is our song,” Chinwe U. Nwosu ’08 said. Drew Faust and our song is “John Brown’s Body.”
Not all of the songs were Larry’s thing, though. “I have never heard of the Bee Gees,” Larry said after “Stayin’ Alive” played. “Is that bad?” No, we’re sure they haven’t heard of you either.
“It was the most fun I’ve ever had on a Thursday night,” Nwosu said. We’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and just assume she always had Friday class.
