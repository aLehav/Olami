After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By many standards, I would be considered a homeschooling success story. I graduated summa cum laude from an Ivy League institution, am gainfully employed by Harvard University, and will be applying to law school in the fall. In third grade, I begged my parents to homeschool me, a plea that I still regret.
Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Bartholet recently made waves with her article suggesting a presumptive ban (not a complete ban, as her remarks have been mischaracterized) on homeschooling in America, requiring parents to “prove they are capable of providing an adequate education in a safe environment.” Bartholet emphasizes the lack of regulation and accountability governing the practice. Among other objections, she discusses cases of undetected abuse, and uneducated parents’ failed attempts to teach their children. While these are valid concerns worthy of debate, many families make the decision to homeschool with the belief that doing so serves their child’s best interest. For that reason, I’d like to discuss the less sinister, but still very real consequences of homeschooling.
As Professor Bartholet notes, a sizable majority of homeschooling families are motivated by religious or ideological reasons. Despite participating in numerous homeschool groups and extracurricular activities, I never met a student with religious or political views differing from my own until I arrived at college. Of course, I knew these individuals existed, but they were always the hypothetical, easily vilified other. It took collegiate friendships to break down internalized stereotypes and see the good in people of different faiths and political persuasions.
Parents often act with the best of intentions when choosing to shield their children from negative influences, but raising them in echo chambers is a dangerous breeding ground for intolerance and misunderstanding. Exposure to opposing viewpoints is crucial for the development of critical reasoning skills. This is especially important for high school students, who will soon encounter disparate viewpoints in college or the workplace.
Advocates cite studies claiming that homeschool students outperform their traditionally schooled peers. However, these findings do not tell the full story. As Professor Bartholet explains, data on homeschooling outcomes is difficult to collect. Data showing high performance only represents the experiences of students who took standardized tests and applied to college. What about those who never will? Furthermore, poster children for homeschool success often come from backgrounds correlated with higher levels of success in traditional schools (higher income, two-parent households, etc.).
The trope of the high-performing homeschooler who gains admission to an elite college is not representative of the reality for many homeschooling families. The Cardus Education Survey, a random sample of 1500 high school graduates, found that religious homeschoolers are four times more likely to end their academic career after high school, and are 60 percent less likely to obtain an advanced degree. For particularly gifted students, homeschooling may be a boon. But it is far from clear that the average homeschooler fares better academically than they would in conventional schooling.
Looking back on my homeschooling experience, I realize that many of my “unique opportunities” would have been available to me in a traditional school setting. I participated in Bible studies, tennis lessons, and even successfully lobbied my state legislature to amend the adolescent driving curfew. But homeschooling, even with these experiences, came with a dangerous sense of isolation and an inappropriate self-emphasis on productivity to compensate for missing out on “normal” rites of passage. Homeschool prom is just as it sounds, and a graduation of three is quite the letdown after twelve years of hard work.
While Professor Bartholet’s proposal of stricter government regulation conflicts with my own Lockean leanings, her critics in the homeschooling community largely miss the mark. The reactions to Bartholet’s work ignore the downsides of the homeschooling experience. Any adequate rebuttal to Bartholet must at least consider the many homeschooled students who do not attend college, and those who, like myself, suffered painful social isolation because of homeschooling. Responsible homeschooling has a place in the academic realm. But far too often, parents choose to homeschool based on an idealized narrative of close families, high test scores, and perfectly sheltered children, without considering the risks of intense groupthink and social isolation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Initially, this column was just supposed to be a way for me to express myself — a way for me to coherently organize my thoughts about Pasefika and my experiences as a Pasefika student at Harvard, an elite, predominantly white institution. And in a way, it’s been very therapeutic, empowering even, to use this platform as a space not only to exist but also to actively assert my presence as a Pasefika student. But, at the same time, writing this column over the past school year has been a mentally, emotionally, and physically draining experience for me because of the pressures of representation.
The burdening pressures of representation have haunted me since my very first week at Harvard. Coming in as a first-year, I was well-aware that I was going to be one of only a few Pacific Islander students on campus — in fact, the only undergraduate student straight out of American Samoa. So, I knew that the pressure to represent my home and my community was inescapable.
At first, the pressure was so subtle that it was almost unnoticeable. It manifested itself in silly questions from my peers such as whether American Samoa was located in the Pacific or the Caribbean or if English was spoken there. It reared its head in strange looks I got as I walked around in my lavalava and absurd comments about how it looked like a “cute, colorful towel”.
Most of the time, my peers were genuinely curious about where I was from and didn’t mean any harm with their questions or comments, and because of the pride I have in where I come from, talking about home was always something I did with joy and excitement. But over time, having to constantly explain myself, my home, and my cultural identity grew tiring — exhausting even. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, I would later come to understand that having to constantly explain myself meant that I was constantly trying to prove that I belonged here — constantly trying to reaffirm and validate my presence at this elite institution.
The pressure to perform representation was not limited to conversations with my peers at Harvard. In fact, arguably most of the pressure to perform representation came from my interactions and conversations with people in my own community every time I went back home. “Malo, Gabby! Keep representing us well out there and making our islands proud!” was the type of thing I would constantly hear from aunties and uncles, old friends, and even people that I’d randomly run into at the store while grocery shopping. Even though I was designated as their representative against my will, there was a part of me that was filled with pride, love, and joy at the thought of my community entrusting me with such a huge responsibility.
So, I started writing this column and justified to myself that I was writing it because one, I loved writing, and two, I loved talking about the Pacific. So, why not combine the two? But it would be dishonest of me to say that the persistent need for validation of my presence on this campus along with the pressures to represent my Pasefika community did not play a major role in my decision to put my ink on these pages.
Writing this column quickly transformed from a liberating haven for me to share my thoughts and ideas about Pasefika into a confining cage of the politics of performing Pasefika representation. As I wrote, I became deathly afraid that what I was writing did not accurately represent my Pasefika community, which is actually an impossible task in the first place considering the diversity of all of Pasefika. I spent days stuck on the same sentence or phrase, wondering how my peers here might construe it as to be representative of all of Pasefika. But perhaps worst of all, I stayed up each night after submitting each new piece for publishing, imagining the horrors of my beloved Pasefika community rejecting me for misrepresenting them, for letting them down.
I continued to bury this pressure, stress, and fear until last November, when I found myself having to visit Harvard’s mental health services for the first time in my life. After a wildly unexpected mental breakdown of uncontrollable sobbing and vomiting, I found myself sitting across the room from a CAMHS therapist, trying to understand what had gotten me to this point in the first place. And after a lengthy conversation with her, I came to the realization that not only was I being crushed by the pressures of performing representation, which had in fact been amplified by writing this column, but I continued to ignore and normalize the violence that this pressure was inflicting upon my mind, body, and soul.
Stories like this aren’t uncommon on this campus. Time and time again, students from underrepresented, underprivileged, and marginalized backgrounds are called on to be representatives of their communities. We are called on to bear the responsibility of continuously validating our own existence and the existence of our communities in spaces that were created to exclude us.
At the same time, we are expected not to acknowledge the physical, mental, and emotional violence that these exclusive spaces inflict upon us. Over my time at Harvard, I’ve learned that I am supposed to pretend that the oppression and microaggressions I experience on campus do not exist, especially since I was “ever so graciously” admitted in the first place. At home, I am supposed to put on a facade of perfect physical, emotional, and mental health, because what struggles could I possibly be facing at a school that is paying my tuition and giving me access to an abundance of resources? To be good representatives, we are to meet these expectations without showing how much we are struggling because that makes not only us, but also our communities seem “weak,” “overly-sensitive,” or “hysterical.”
I understand that, regardless of what I have said in this piece, I will still be held accountable as some sort of representative of Pasefika in virtue of belonging to such an underrepresented community at Harvard. But, I shouldn’t be. Because Pasefika is infinite, expansive like the Pacific Ocean, and it cannot be captured through one person’s words on paper. Regardless, I made the decision to continue to write this past semester because of my love for my Pasefika family and the pride and joy that I have seen this column’s assertion of Pasefika presence bring to them. I continue to write in the hopes that one day, Pasefika presence will not have to be continuously and forcefully asserted in order to remain visible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School will begin classes online for all first-year students in its medical, dental, and graduate programs this fall, the school announced Wednesday.
In an email to school affiliates, Medical School administrators wrote that the school is planning to offer on-campus research and clinical training for returning students. They added that they hope all students can return to campus by January 2021.
Signed by Medical School Dean George Q. Daley, Dean for Medical Education Edward M. Hundert, Dean for Graduate Education Rosalind A. Segal, and Dean for External Education David H. Roberts, the email noted the school has “undertaken an intensive planning process.” In making the decision, they wrote they considered the “unique” needs of their programs — which operate on schedules unlike many courses taught at the College and other professional schools — while also weighing the school’s duty to “sustain the health care workforce.”
“Given the uniqueness of our education programs, which run for 12 months and emphasize hands-on learning, we hope to be able to hold in-person research and clinical experiences for our returning medical and graduate students and will continue to closely follow institutional guidelines and public health developments,” the administrators wrote.
Administrators wrote they were “confident” that the school could continue to deliver “high-quality, transformative educational experiences” for students.
“We are confident that we can uphold the excellence that is the signature of a Harvard education,” the email read. “We are also committed to assisting our teaching faculty in designing online courses that meet these high standards and in supporting technologies that bolster our teaching and learning initiatives.”

While many winter sports had their seasons abruptly cut short in early March due to the evacuation of campus and NCAA cancellations in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak, the 2019-2020 winter athletic season was nonetheless a source of energetic competition for Harvard Athletics. The Crimson Multimedia Staff went into this season’s archive to look back and share previously unpublished sports photos from this past winter season.
The Crimson celebrated a close win after the final buzzer went off against the University of California at Lavietes Pavilion in their second game of the season, and home opener, on November 8.
Shannon S. Hollands '23 and Anne E. Bloomer '22 chased a loose puck during a 4-0 win over Dartmouth University on January 31.
Harvard track and field seniors were recognized at the annual Crimson Elite Meet on January 31.
The Crimson’s wrestling team competed at the Malkin Athletic Center on February 1, during one of two home bouts this season, against the University of Pennsylvania. Lukus W. Stricker '21 wrestled against Doug Zapf at 141 pounds to begin the match.
Women’s squash secured its sixth consecutive national championship this year. In a regular-season match on February 7, co-captain and All-American Gina Kennedy '20 fiercely competed in the court against Brown University.
In February, men’s fencing won the Beanpot for the twelfth year in a row, and the Ivy League Championship title outright for the first time since 2013. The women’s team won the Beanpot for the thirteenth consecutive year and finished fourth at Ivies.
Campbell J. Schoenfeld '22 went up for a hit against two Pennsylvania State University blockers on February 22.
Charles J. Vaughan '21 and co-captain Daniel W. Chang '20 smiled en route to winning the Ivy League Men’s Swimming and Diving Championship for the fourth year in a row. The last time Harvard accomplished this four-peat was from 1998-2001.
Men’s hockey huddled together in a home contest against Union at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on February 29.
Lola N. Mullaney '23 drove to the rim in a matchup against Cornell University on February 29. Mullaney earned an All-Ivy honorable mention and led the Ivy League in made three-pointers.
Women’s hockey faced off against Yale University in the second game of the ECAC Quarterfinals at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on that same day, February 29.
The Harvard bench and crowd reacted to an exciting play during senior night against Brown University on March 6, a game which ended up being the Crimson’s sole home loss this season. Harvard’s twelve game home win streak – which extended into the prior season – led them to an Ivy-best home record of 11-1 when defending Lavietes Pavilion.
Danilo Djuricic '21 made a move on Jordan Bruner in the final home matchup of the season against Yale. Harvard won by 14 points to complete the 2-0 season sweep over Yale, having previously bested them by a single point in New Haven. The Crimson would have entered the Ivy-League Tournament as the two-seed behind the Bulldogs.
While the timing of NCAA competitions’ return is uncertain, The Crimson’s athletic teams continue to improve this offseason, and when the time comes, Harvard will be ready.
