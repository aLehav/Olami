After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 23, 2019 at 12:19 a.m.
Eli J. Langley ’20-’21 entered Harvard with his heart set on continuing to preserve his tribal language Koasati.
But when he arrived on campus, Langley said he found that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ language programs did not allow him to see his passion for Koasati reflected on his transcript. Unable to use Koasati to fulfill his language requirement, Langley said he spent the next two and a half years lobbying the Office of Undergraduate Education to receive credit for his studies, even taking a yearlong leave of absence while he worked on the cause.
Koasati is the language spoken by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, a federally recognized Native American tribe with only 865 members. Langley, who grew up on a Coushatta reservation, estimates that only 200 to 300 people currently speak Koasati.
His work preserving the language — what he calls “the thing that I've cared about the most my entire life” — featured heavily in his college applications. Though multiple Harvard officials, including his admissions officer and a resident dean, asked him about his work, Langley said he was for a long time unable to actively pursue his goal at school.
“I just remember feeling like I told these people who I was and what I cared about when I was applying,” Langley said. “I almost felt like I wasn't welcome, or that I didn't fit, or that there was something wrong and that this wasn't the right place for me.”
But recent changes to the College’s language requirement in its handbook have paved the way for more Native-American students — as well as those proficient in other languages such as American Sign Language and Ancient Greek — to receive credit for proficiency.
The changes — approved by the Faculty in a November vote — allow students seeking to test out of a language not offered at Harvard to ask the OUE to recruit a qualified examiner from another university.
Previously, students who wanted to fulfill the requirement with a language not offered by FAS had to appeal in order to find an expert at Harvard who could administer the exam. The changes also allowed students to use languages without a “written component” to fulfill their requirement.
For some native languages with very few speakers, the process of finding a Harvard examiner could be burdensome, if not impossible, according to Philip J. Deloria, a history professor whose work focuses on indigenous peoples.
“I think one of the things Eli’s case shows is a recognition, certainly among mid-level and upper-level administrators, that you know, this is really not the best thing for our students, and we really ought to rethink this a bit,” he said.
Last month, Langley received word that he would be allowed to take a Koasati proficiency test. Professor Jack B. Martin, a linguist at The College of William and Mary who specializes in Muskogean languages and worked on the Coushatta tribe’s project to restore Koasati, proctored the test.
Last week, the OUE told Langley that his fluency in Koasati would fulfill the language requirement.
“I’m so happy,” Langley said. “I have five semesters left. I'm excited to feel like a normal student, to not have to be thinking about this constantly, to not have to feel like it's a struggle to be here, per se.”
Noah D. Cominsky ’20, president of Native Americans at Harvard College, said he applauded the College’s decision to allow Langley to use Koasati to fulfill the language requirement. He cited the Harvard Charter of 1650, in which the University promised to “conduce to the education” of “Indian youth.”
“Eli getting his language used as his language requirement is an excellent example in which Harvard is following the charter,” he wrote in an email. “NAHC is extremely happy that Eli was able to get Koasati approved for his language requirement and hope that the support for Native students can continue to increase by Harvard.”
Deloria said that Native languages — whose preservation he called “fundamentally important” to Native students and their communities — may require different standards than other languages, especially given that some have become “endangered.”
“Establishing a set of criteria that look like a French exam translated laterally to a Native language is not a recipe for success,” Deloria said. “There may have to be a little bit of flexibility around that.”
Langley said he was in part inspired to continue pushing administrators to grant him credit for his study of Koasati by the younger Native students at Harvard who wanted to test out in their own languages. He called the accomplishment both a personal victory and “a victory for Indian country at the oldest university in America.”
“I wanted to do it primarily for me, because I felt that it was important for my language and I thought it would have been like a really special part of history and been the right thing to do to recognize my language,” Langley said. “But a huge consideration also was that, if I stopped, then my feeling was that this would just continue happening.”
“It will be a step in the right direction, towards language recognition for not just American Indians, not just any particular people group, but for anyone that has felt like their language wasn't given credibility by Harvard or by institutions like Harvard,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON D.C., — Behind the Harvard bench stood Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan L’86. On the opposing side stood U.S. Senator and Howard alumnus Kamala Harris, who earlier in the day had just announced her 2020 presidential candidacy. Adding to the symbolism of this clash between two storied academic institutions was the stage itself and its game date: Burr Gymnasium — on the campus of Howard University — during Martin Luther King Monday.
In front of such a distinguished backdrop, the hardwood itself saw the long-awaited return of the Crimson point guard donning #11. After 348 days away from competitive action, Bryce Aiken is indeed back - and it took just 16 seconds for the junior to make his impact felt on the 2018-2019 season. On the opening possession of the game, the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year drilled the game’s first field goal attempt, a deep three from the upper left arc that gave Harvard (7-7, 0-1 Ivy) a lead it would never surrender.
Coach Tommy Amaker had no hesitancies in re-introducing his star guard, inserting him into the starting lineup and featuring him for 29 minutes in Harvard’s 84-71 wire-to-wire victory over the Bisons (8-12, 2-3 MEAC), the team’s final non-conference contest of the season. The Randolph, N.J., native finished with five assists and 16 points on 4-of-10 shooting. Aiken’s mere presence on the court offered a boost to the Crimson’s hopes of an Ancient Eight title, especially as defending Ivy League player of the year Seth Towns remains absent.
“I had to shake off a little jitters in the beginning of the game,” Aiken said. “But the team trusts me and Coach trusts me, so once I got comfortable, I just played my game and it made it easy for me.”
More than being a re-arrival showcase for Aiken, however, the Crimson win was the product of a collective effort. Junior forward Robert Baker, who had seen limited minutes in recent contests, notched his first double-double of the season with 11 points and 13 boards.
“Very impressive, he had six rebounds at the half and I told him that if he didn’t get at least 10, that would be a disappointment,” Amaker said. “Suddenly he got 13. Really pleased with his effort on the backboard.”
Wing Justin Bassey topped the scoring sheet with 18 points with four triples. All five Harvard starters, members of the lauded junior class, finished the contest in double figures, an example of the balance that Coach Tommy Amaker has frequently exalted throughout the season.
“I think they slowed us down and put us on our heels a little bit,” Amaker said. “It stopped our penetration where we could penetrate and kick and make shots. It was a nice move by them but we settled in and adjusted.”
Bassey’s performance from the free-throw line was another positive aspect of Monday’s victory. The Denver, Colo., native, who had shot at around 80 percent through his first two seasons in Cambridge, entered Monday at 50 percent from the charity stripe. Bassey knocked down all four of his free-throws, as part of an impressive 22-of-24 road effort from the line.
“Definitely all starts with defensive rebounds and positive possessions,” Bassey said. “Today we did a great job getting locked in with 20 assists and making our free throws, a lot of little things taken care. All those things tend to add up for us.”
The team’s balanced attack resulted in a season-high 84 points, as well as a season-high 45-point first half. The Crimson jumped out to a quick 6-0 start, as part of a 17-7 run that forced Howard to take a timeout early in the first half. Although the Bisons would narrow the margin in the first half and later in the second half, Harvard was able to see out Monday’s victory without too much stress. One notable absence from the win was freshman Noah Kirkwood, who has struggled of late and missed the game with an illness.
The Crimson’s 14 turnovers was as welcome a statistic as any for a team that found itself 341st out of 351 Division I programs in turnovers entering Monday’s action, at almost 17 per game. And while the team’s ball-handling still leaves much to be desired, the return of Aiken should bring some veteran confidence to the backcourt alongside Christian Juzang.
Harvard will hope that Monday afternoon’s victory is a harbinger of things to come, and will catalyze the team leading up to a Saturday rematch with Dartmouth at Lavietes Pavilion. An Ivy League season that had offered so much promise for the Crimson opened in a worse manner than anyone would have expected, with a 81-63 loss in Hanover last Saturday, and Harvard will surely be seeking a dominant win in Cambridge this coming weekend.
“I just thought our kids played with a great spirit,” Amaker said. “We talked about regrouping and responding from our last outing— which wasn't a pretty outing [at Dartmouth] and I felt we really handled things well this whole past week to get us in position to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After earning a much needed 1-0 road win last weekend at Dartmouth, Harvard returned home to Bright-Landry Hockey Center for one of its toughest weekend slates in the conference. Facing No.8/8 Colgate on Friday and No. 7/7 Cornell on Saturday, the Crimson could not muster an upset against two of the ECAC’s top four teams.
CORNELL 6 HARVARD 0
Harvard did prove to be up for the challenge of facing the nation’s seventh-ranked team for the first chunk of the first period. However, after Cornell (11-2-5, 9-2-1 ECAC) added its first tally, the Crimson strayed from its traditionally vaunted defense. Five more goals and one goalie pull later, Harvard had fallen 6-0 to the Big Red.
“We had a really good start, I thought, right off the [opening] faceoff,” Gilmore said. “We just deflated when they got a goal. Cornell came to play — they brought their game — and I don’t think we brought our game.”
Locked at 0-0 for the first eight minutes of play, the teams seemed poised for a nail-biter. After all, in October, the Big Red had edged the Crimson by just one goal, 3-2. Over the next eight minutes, however, the game unraveled for Harvard as Cornell added three quick goals.
So far in January, the Crimson has been playing short-staffed, suffering from a series of injuries and other absences. After getting many players back together last week and experimenting with new lineups, a lack of chemistry seemed to plague Harvard in the second game of the weekend.
“I think one part of it was that this was the first weekend everyone was back,” Tse said. “Everyone’s in, and everyone has new roles. Maybe we didn’t adapt to those new roles as quickly as we should have. Frankly, I think that we didn’t have as many people on the same page as we would have liked, and that shows in the score.”
The Big Red would continue its offensive explosion in the second period, adding three more goals to draw the scoreline to 6-0 before the second intermission. In fact, after the fifth goal, the Crimson would pull Reed, who has the second-highest save percentage in the nation at 0.945, for sophomore Becky Dutton. Dutton closed out the game for the Crimson with one goal allowed on seven shots.
“We have one of the best goalies in the NCAA, and we hung her out to dry,” Gilmore said. “She’s saved us in so many games, and then in this game couldn’t bail us out.”
Despite a slow first two periods, Harvard did manage to flip the momentum in the third. Although the Crimson could not score, the team outshot Cornell over the final frame 14-4. Harvard found a way to finish strong and will look to build upon that fact before trying to muster a postseason run, which will necessitate stronger offensive play.
“If you can’t score, you’re not going to win games,” Tse said. “Right now, that’s what we’re focusing on. Whatever line combination that is, whatever power play combination, [penalty kill] combination. Right now, we’ve just got to get back to work and figure it out. There’s no point of sugar coating it. We’ve just got to win games.”
COLGATE 4 HARVARD 2
Despite getting eight more shots on goal over the first two frames, Harvard found itself down 3-0 heading into the third period. Over the first half of the final act — despite flurries of chances — the Crimson could not find the back of the net.
All of the sudden, however, the Crimson netted two goals in a 1:31 span. With five minutes remaining in the game, Harvard had cut the deficit to 3-2 and seemed poised to complete the comeback. For senior defender Kaitlin Tse, the game plan for the final five minutes was straightforward.
“Go, don’t guess,” Tse said. “Simply, that’s it. You have nothing to lose at this point. You want to manage the game well. You want to manage it when you pull the goalie.”
Nonetheless, with the goalie replaced for an extra skater, Harvard could not complete the comeback, surrendering an empty net goal to Raiders’ sophomore forward Malia Schneider with 1:02 left on the clock. By the time the scoreboard hit zeroes, Colgate (14-6-4, 8-2-2 ECAC) emerged as 4-2 victors, completing a contest in which it had never trailed.
The Raiders came out to a quick start, striking just 5:37 into the opening frame with a power play blast from senior defender Olivia Zafuto. Taking a pass from the point, Zafuto walked up a couple strides to the top of the faceoff circle before firing through a screen and by the arm of Harvard freshman goalie Lindsay Reed, who finished the game with 32 saves on 35 shots. Just under ten minutes later, Colgate added another goal from sophomore forward Coralie Larose.
Throughout the first two periods, the Crimson held a steady advantage over the Raiders in shots, earning a 32-24 advantage over that span. Despite Harvard’s success in generating chances, the only goal of the second period belonged to Colgate as the Raiders stretched their lead to 3-0 before the second to intermission.
“We had a lot of shots on net—more shots than we’ve had all season—and that gave us a lot of confidence going into the third,” sophomore forward Becca Gilmore said. “Basically, the message was just keep playing how we were playing. We were playing Harvard hockey. At some point the puck [would] go in if you get shots.”
For the first two-thirds of the final period, Harvard maintained pressure but also defended well, holding Colgate scoreless on their 12 shots in the third. With the defense shored up and the chances continuing to come, the Crimson finally reaped dividends for its shooting advantage. With 6:31 left in the game, Harvard found its scoring touch, with offense coming from the defensive end. After passes from freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere and Gilmore, Tse found the top corner of the net from long range.
“I got a good pass...I waited out a screen, and I shot high,” Tse said. “I just picked a corner and got lucky enough — it went in.”
Harvard would keep its foot on the gas and find offense again from the same source. At the five-minute mark — on the power play and on the opposite side of the ice — Tse found the top shelf a second time. Curling up from near the goal line and towards the top of the circle, Tse picked the other top corner. Also like on the first goal, Gilmore added an assist with co-captain and forward Lexie Laing contributing the secondary pass.
“At this point, you’re just shooting to score,” Tse said. “You don’t want to set up plays at this point. So, I picked a corner, and I shot, and lucky enough, same thing, I got a goal. It was luck and sharp shooting combined.”
The offensive chances would continue for the final minutes of the game, but the goals did not. After surrendering the empty netter and finishing the game 4-2, the Crimson found themselves 5-9-2 on the season.
Despite the setback, the game ended with Harvard outshooting the Raiders 42-36 and winning the faceoff battle 30-29 as well. Moreover, the Crimson won the third period and controlled the momentum in the final stanza, giving the squad some positives to build off of for its second matchup of the weekend against No. 7/7 Cornell.
“I think it’s encouraging, definitely, that we can put 42 shots on a phenomenal team,” Gilmore said. “But it definitely is frustrating when the puck isn’t going in the net… [It’s] definitely a little frustrating, but also a positive outlook that we can compete at that level. We just need to learn to dig deep and bury them [shots].”
~
In many ways, Harvard is treating this weekend like a new beginning. With a fuller roster and the experience of a few months of conference play, the Crimson is turning to its junior and senior leadership to finish the campaign strong.
“We had a great message from our captains and our leadership from the senior and junior class that, come Monday, it’s going to be a new year, and we’re going to have to find a way to play a full 60 minutes,” Gilmore said. “We’re going to get to work on Monday, and things are going to change next weekend. I have no doubt in my mind.”
Echoing a similar sentiment, Tse emphasized that the team must return to basics and play more cohesively. If the Crimson can do that, the squad is confident it should have the ability to climb the conference standings.
“[If] we play our systems, and we do our jobs and buy into our roles, we can be a very good team. Easier said than done. This weekend should be a good test. We are a good team whenever we play together, and we proved it in Wisconsin over Thanksgiving Break.”
