Despite a change in directors, “Fifty Shades Darker” is not much of an improvement from last year’s “Fifty Shades of Grey.” Both “Grey” and “Darker” are adapted from the erotic novels by E.L. James, and both try and fail to escape the clunky dialogue and clichéed plot of their fanfiction roots. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprise their roles as Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, the series’ seemingly star-crossed lovers, but James Foley replaces “Grey” director Sam Taylor–Johnson—presumably in a (miserably futile) attempt to rescue the sequel from the mediocrity of the first installment. As it turns out, “Darker” suffers from the same lack of plot and cardboard–cutout characters that plagued its predecessor.
Foley has an impressive resume for someone heading up a softcore pornographic film with a massive budget, including director credits for both “Glengarry Glen Ross” and a number of “House of Cards” episodes. Even his experience with taut, witty drama, however, could not save a film that has little in the way of plot or character to speak of. The film opens a short time after the dramatic conclusion of “Grey,” in which Ana breaks up with Christian due to his sadistic sexual needs. Ana seems eager to move on, while Christian clearly can’t, setting up what looks to be a long chase—Except that, less than fifteen minutes into the movie, Christian has managed to convince Ana to come back to him. He has changed since she last saw him, and he says he is ready for a real relationship, without a contract, rules, or punishments. After this too–speedy resolution, however, the storyline is basically over.
Perhaps this is unfair—there are side plots and challenges thrown at Ana and Christian, at times seemingly at random. This dynamic duo faces down a creepy boss, a suicidal stalker, and even a totally unexplained helicopter crash. Because these obstacles are so clearly and unnaturally fabricated to drive drama, there is never any doubt that the couple will overcome them easily. Even the problems that occur between Ana and Christian are easily resolved by fresh acts of shirtless physical intimacy on Christian’s part (in a climactic scene, he even lets Ana touch his chest!). Their relationship seems invincible, not because these characters in any way belong together but because the screenwriters cannot let them break up.
In the end, only one of the obstacles that Ana and Christian face is a genuine challenge: Elena Lincoln (Kim Basinger, doing yeoman’s service in an underserved role), Christian’s sexual mentor. Elena is a different kind of threat because she represents the doubts that Christian himself has in his ability to change. She thinks Christian can’t ever be the type to settle down, and is clearly emotionally invested in this notion. Her comeuppance is the highlight of the film, but even this moment is tinged with disappointment—what could have been a major conflict of the film is reduced into another hurdle, easily overcome in Ana and Christian’s inexorable march towards happiness.
Those coming to theaters not for plot but for beautiful naked people are well served. “Darker” is just as action–packed as its predecessor, including one gym scene that can only possibly be described as “Christian Grey Fan Service.” There are other legitimate reasons to enjoy this movie, or at least prefer it to “Grey.” The music is often great, and well–synced with the action going on onscreen. The overall mise–en–scene is lighter than the previous film, less dominated by greys and blacks. There are many moments of hilarity, unintentional or not, that can sustain even the most antagonistic viewer (including memorable lines such as, “No, you’re not putting those in my butt”). Overall, however, this is softcore porn with nearly wooden acting from its male lead and very little in the way of plot or character development.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The best argument I heard in favor of identifying as a feminist was from a teacher, who said combatting sexism with semantics provided no armor. I trusted her because she was everything I wanted to be: black; tinged with bravado; brimming with stories of San Francisco, the Bronx, and Ivy League dorms; articulate; cosmopolitan. But back then, I wasn’t too concerned with the flex of self-definition. There were a million reasons to not be a feminist, including that I was too sympathetic to the yellow man’s plight, straight as hell, in love with Rihanna, cuffed up by libertarians, okay with makeup, pretty certain feminists were racists, believed in joint custody as a standard, and attempting to make my virginal body look as un-celibate as possible.
Feminist film critic Laura Mulvey articulated an influential theory of the male gaze, claiming the multiple ways in which perspectives, characters, and planes in films are formed exclusively through a male spectator. She claimed an eroticization of female subjects for both male characters and implied male viewers, that reduced a woman’s humanity to her body. I was skeptical of this theory because I also, as a straight girl, derived pleasure from viewing the female body, and found myself, not unlike males, attracted to the stories of beautiful characters. Furthermore, I grew up racialized. On a basic level, I believed I was never going to be the girl of wet dreams, rape fantasies, and angsty movie plots, because my skin was too dark, my eyes too small, my body too flat, and there was time, countries, a history of colonialism, school, and wealth separating me from a woman who could claim to be their subject. The times a white male was attracted to me were so few and far between that when presented with blunt cases proving the existence of yellow fever, such as David Bowie’s “China Girl” and Weezer’s “El Scorcho”, I couldn’t take them seriously. I mostly considered them as fascinating cases where white guys got socialized wrong. In sum, I was so far removed from the eroticized female subjects of film and magazines that I never thought it was something that applied to me.
But I also reasoned that if a male gaze existed, and if it applied to me, it was inseparable from my understanding of myself. In some ways I would never stop comparing myself to a standard of beauty constructed by men. Some of my most glorious moments of early adolescence were related directly to achieving, in my own view, that standard of beauty, and though I said the objective of my self-decoration was to feel golden, I can’t ignore that my feelings of confidence in presentability took place in a male world, my joy in seeing myself being seen. And it was a special kind of joy. Taking away the male gaze would be like reimagining a world where race did not exist; it was neither feasible nor preferable. I could not ignore that without it almost all my experience living on this planet would not have occurred, so to hate it unconditionally was a form of escapism I could not afford if I wanted to be powerful in my body, to love myself, to be confident in the validity of my experience.
So I asked my teacher, if I did not believe misogyny applied to me, why did I need armor? She laughed because she knew, even if I didn’t, that it did; I just refused to see it. Like everyone else I knew, by the time of this conversation, I had the experience of being the sole female in rooms where boys actively rated, bragged about, schemed on, and discussed preying upon girls. Where, instead of the realization that I could also have been one of their topics of conversation, I felt the privilege of occupying a space I believed few girls had entered (which was not true). I had also actively passed over girls to work with boys who seemed smarter, louder, more powerful, and was given, gladly, jobs none of them wanted (i.e. “Draw Pamela Anderson on this board and color her tits real well”). My apathy and desire to please the opposite sex continued into April of junior year of high school, when a boy I knew told me he drugged up another girl at a party to have sex with her, which I said was acceptable, a response which made even him look surprised.
It is fair to say that my navigation through feminism lay directly in my refusal to admit victimhood. And the consequences of that refusal. And the idea that I was the exception, that I could roll with boys, have my cake, be friends with girls, feel empowered, be borderline womanist, make dirty jokes, have an air of mystery, and get pretty, simultaneously. I evaluated myself consistently through the perspective of another, inevitably male. To see what I wanted, which was not what I wanted. By denying an extent of victimhood I was able to blind myself to the multiple ways my body, mind, and soul were disrespected. I developed, like many girls of color, like Erykah Badu who when describing her encounters with infidelity said “I do understand the nature of these men I’ve been with; they have a need to chase,” like all the girls I knew who loved Eminem and PartyNextDoor like no one’s business and shook their heads at Taylor Swift for being overly sensitive, like Celie in The Color Purple who accepted her sexual abuse as her sexuality, quiet and no fuss, an ability to laugh, brush off, stroke, forgive. I never felt it was my cage. To me, it was my coolest personality trait, my cutest party trick.
I could blame my social desires to disclaim the label of feminism, the swing of patriarchy, my own predilections to miseducation. But I came to feminism after coming to terms with the illogical defenses of my own psyche, the ways I tolerated when I should not have, the moments when I was active in the oppression of my own gender because I believed I was harder, more equipped. But who knew it was impossible to claim labels that can never claim you.

Valentine’s Day for Harvard students can be unique because of our anticipation for the Harvard Computer Society’s annual matchmaking survey Datamatch. The program runs an algorithm based on survey questions and biographical data to match undergraduate students with potential dates for food around Harvard Square. However, the program is facing criticism by students due to its adherence to the gender binary in introductory questions for participants.
Contention focuses on Datamatch's requirement that an individual to declare their gender and the preferred gender of potential matches within the limited categories of male or female. Individuals who wish to include more information about their gender identity outside of this binary can only do so in a section marked “extra” that was originally placed at the end of the survey.
A binary conceptualization of gender does not leave space for the representation of individuals whose gender identity falls out of the binary. Forcing students to choose a gender identity that is restricted to two fields centers cisgendered norms and erases the multiplicity of nonconforming gender identities.
We feel that continued use of a gender binary on the survey demonstrates an oversight regarding the diversity of our student population. Datamatch’s constrictions show the shortcomings of current pushes to make Harvard a more inclusive space for all identities. Even when it comes to popular, light-hearted traditions like Datamatch, the entire student body should feel able to participate. While the program is well intentioned in its aim to foster friendship and romance, the focus on specific identities and alienation of others is unacceptable.
That said, we acknowledge and appreciate the respectful actions of the developers and students working on the program to improve it for the future. Since the release of the survey, the developers have generated productive dialogue with students passionate about inclusion on how to improve Datamatch.
This is an issue requiring cooperative feedback from Harvard students of various experiences and passions. In the future, we hope Datamatch will be more cognizant of the impact of its survey on student inclusion. We understand that the mystery of the algorithm adds to the overall experience of Datamatch; however, transparency is necessary when it comes to nuanced issues like these that may require feedback from students outside of HCS. Inclusivity should not be sacrificed for mystery.
We also understand that this is both a highly technical issue and a complicated social issue. This situation provides the opportunity for valuable interdisciplinary collaboration between a more diverse group of Harvard students. The program’s dependence on a binary gender field must be expanded in some way, possibly through creating a third, gender-nonconforming option and including an option to receive gender-conforming and gender-nonconforming matches. We encourage Harvard students of all disciplines to continue to brainstorm new approaches to this issue and remind Datamatch developers that this is not an impossible problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The morning following Election Day, one of my professors urged my class to understand the importance of education and how it will play a vital role in challenging the poisonous ideologies at play in America. I took this advice and I raised him: I would devote myself to every detail of my coursework so that I would be my most educated, socially aware, and politically active self. I became engrossed in my studies and engaged constantly with critical theory texts covering every system of oppression from race relations to gender power dynamics to healthcare crises to toxic sexual scripts between peers and more.
But I became intensely and emotionally connected to this information. I woke up each day overwhelmed by the work to be done. I tried to fight the good fight by not allowing myself to escape the issues around me and I did not dare allow myself the luxury of mental reprieve. I still do not consider reprieve as something to be taken lightly or often; however, I have realized that there is a point when we must take care of ourselves in order to take care of the world.
The world is changing. It is apparent that there are still vehement disagreements over universally important issues such as immigration policies, healthcare accessibility, free exchange of culture, freedom of speech, and the “proper” way to express patriotism, as well as many other issues. This current political climate feels tense and ominous and terrifying to many individuals across the world, and the United States is taking center-stage for social and political tension.
But generally speaking, we have never experienced a time that has not been marked by some amount of dramatic international upheaval and we have certainly not experienced a United States that is not marred by tension and revolution. The world is, in fact, changing, but it is not transitioning from a perfect state into a state of ruin; it is transitioning from one state of confusion and terror and political instability to the next. Considering even the last century, the world has lived through the struggle to end apartheid in South Africa, the creation and destruction of the Berlin Wall, both World Wars, and the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, among innumerable other global issues.
This perpetuation of distress does not invalidate the necessity to resist when necessary; on the contrary, we find ourselves needing to act in a climate of upheaval that is uniquely our own. We have the ability to use this period of discomfort to either generate change on a massive scale or to submit to the distress and backtrack on progress.
Right now, for some students, university studies seem to pale in importance compared to the systemic, dangerous, explicit problems of this world. But for others, academic studies are an avenue into understanding the dynamics of this world and they function as a way to find some solution to the many problems affecting us today. It is important that we reach a personal balance between self-care and education.
And the definition of education ranges, so it is important that we push ourselves out of our comfort zones and expose ourselves to different ideas. Education does not simply mean attending courses at higher level institutions, nor does it mean developing pre-existing raw talent; to educate oneself in the current global political climate means to be aware of how the world’s dynamics are affecting individuals and to learn to be critical thinkers about resolving these issues. Being present in education should not be overlooked, now more than ever.
Balance is delicate; focus is crucial. When we take on all of the struggles of the world we run the risk of losing track of our own lives. And our lives and our world necessitate us to look at problems with an open yet critical mind. Focusing on how we can achieve our goals today and prepare for the future—whether that is towards coursework, personal relationships, or individual health—is critical to our progress.
As students and young adults, we must realize that recognizing what work must be done to make the world a better place and thinking about the ways to feasibly achieve this is the most effective way to progress our world through this tumultuous time. We do not have to attempt to save the world immediately, but we must set our minds to the future and critically examine the ways to achieve progress. Our resilience against injustice will come from paying attention to exactly when, where, and how to dissent.

After over a year of disputes, the Broad Institute—a genetics research center affiliated with Harvard and MIT—won the right to keep its patent for CRISPR, a groundbreaking gene-editing technology, in a ruling Wednesday.
The Broad Institute was embroiled in a legal battle for over a year against the University of California, Berkeley in US Patent Trial Court. For months, scientists at UC Berkeley claimed that they invented the CRISPR technology first.
In a press release, the Broad Institute maintained that its patent and that of UC Berkeley were entirely different. According to the Broad Institute, UC Berkeley applied for CRISPR patents not related to eukaryotic—including human—cells while Broad’s patents did specify eukaryotic cell-editing methods.
“We agree with the decision by the patent office, which confirms that the patents and applications of Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are about different subjects and do not interfere with each other,” the press release reads.
Three judges presided over the case and handed down their ruling Wednesday, agreeing with the Broad Institute’s claim.
“Based on our determination that the preponderance of the evidence shows that there is no interference-in-fact between the parties’ claims, we need not decide the other pending motions,” the judges wrote. “A determination of no interference-in-fact deprives UC of standing to raise other challenges against Broad’s claims in this proceeding.”
Fallout from the decision was rapid. According to Reuters, Intellia Therapeutics Inc, which is associated in a licensing deal with UC Berkeley, saw its shares fall by 9 percent on Wednesday. In a boon for Editas Medicine Inc, a biotechnology firm associated with the Broad Institute, shares rose by 29 percent on Wednesday.
The Broad Institute was awarded its first CRISPR patent in 2014 despite UC Berkeley applying for their own patent in 2012.
The patent battle is not the first controversy to involve the Broad Institute recently. Last year, the founding director of the Broad Institute came under fire after publishing an article which, according to critics, understated the contributions of women in developing a biotechnology and failed to disclose the Institute’s involvement in the CRISPR court battle.
CRISPR gets its name from sequences of bacterial DNA that aid in recognizing foreign viral DNA sequences and has the potential to delete or edit genetic material. Academics have asserted that the technology has the potential to correct disorders like Huntington’s disease and cystic fibrosis. CRISPR has also sparked ethical debates about the future role of gene editing.

Humanities professors and University administrators are bracing for the potential elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities under President Donald Trump’s administration, which some say could seriously hamper research at Harvard.
In January, The Hill reported that Trump was planning to shutter both foundations—which give thousands of dollars in grants annually to Harvard and other universities—as part of his plan to reduce government bureaucracy.
In the past fiscal year, the amount of funding Harvard received from non-federal sources like foundations and corporations increased at a higher rate than that from federal sources like the NEH and NEA. Earlier this year, some professors said they were concerned that federal funding would be further compromised under Trump.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said he is factoring in the possible elimination of these agencies as FAS designs its yearly budget.
“It’s one of the things that we think about as we’re going through the budget process: What kind of changes might we see in the future if funding in the arts dries up, who’s going to be affected, what kind of research taking place on the campus,” he said. “We’ve made some changes in preparation, not necessarily for specifically what President Trump might do, but just in terms of the uncertainty and the overall environment in this place.”
English Department Chair James Simpson said elimination of the NEH would affect his colleagues' ability to get funding for sabbaticals.
“Our faculty really depend on the ability of fellowships to do research,” he said.  “Without the NEH that ability would be much diminished.”
According to Harvard’s Office for Sponsored Programs’ annual report, researchers in the life sciences received almost half of Harvard’s federal and nonfederal grants in fiscal year 2016—$407 million—while the humanities received just $3 million, or less than 1 percent. Simpson said few professors in his department receive federal or foundation funding.
Over the years, the NEH and NEA have honored faculty members and funded hundreds of thousands of dollars in projects at Harvard.
Theater, Dance, and Media Chair Martin Puchner said that while the loss of the NEA and NEH likely wouldn’t affect undergraduates in his concentration, it would be a “disaster” for the theater scene.
“I think that this election, across the arts and humanities, has really reminded us why what we do is so important,” he said.
Effects of these potential cuts extend beyond the humanities, according to Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild, who said some researchers in her department rely on the NEH. Social sciences researchers received $98 million in federal and nonfederal grants in fiscal year 2016, or 12 percent of the University’s total.
Despite the uncertain future of the two agencies, Smith said there are other funding avenues for arts and humanities research.
“Lots of people are interested in supporting the arts. So you might be thinking, ‘well, this was my only avenue of funding’ and we’ve got to find whether there’s actually a potential to develop new avenues of funding, if one of them’s going to completely disappear,” he said. “I hope not. We hope that the NEA does not disappear, but we’re thinking about what to do if that happens.”
FAS has also begun to provide research funding for faculty itself. In March, Smith announced the Dean’s Competitive Fund for Promising Scholarship, which provides $2.5 million in grants to faculty annually. However, Smith said it is still important for Faculty to compete for federal and foundation money.
“We’ll certainly be fighting to keep the NEH,” Simpson said.

Computer science and public policy experts from Harvard and MIT spoke at a Kennedy School forum Thursday night about the potential of eliminating human bias and errors in policy-making through artificial intelligence.
At an event called “Artificial Intelligence & Bias: Past, Present & Future,” moderator and Kennedy School professor Sheila Jasanoff asked panelists about the limitations and intricacies of employing artificial intelligence systems. Artificial intelligence is beginning to rival human decision-making for recruiting employees, determining loan eligibility, and steering automobiles.
Iris Bohnet, a panelist and public policy professor at the Kennedy School, said she feels optimistic about the potential of machines to help overcome human biases against race and gender. She shared her research about human bias in job application processes, where some employers can discriminate against applicants with criminal records.
“I definitely fall into the camp of people who believe that humans are biased,” Bohnet said. “There is quite a bit of evidence suggesting that it is extremely hard to de-bias our minds, and that it might actually be more promising to… redesign how we work and how we learn, to address this.”
Computer Science professor Cynthia Dwork noted that algorithms can exhibit bias as well. Dwork cited the “stable matching algorithm,” which is used to match medical students with residency hospitals, and said the algorithm could be run either to prioritize students’ or hospitals’ preferences.
“This is an example of an algorithm that has a bias, and the person running the algorithm can choose which direction the bias will go in,” Dwork said. “The fact that something is an algorithm doesn’t make it fair.”
During the event, an audience member noted that for many, algorithms are incomprehensible and like a “black box.” The attendee asked how algorithms can be held “accountable” so that members of the public can better understand decision-making.
Panelist and MIT Professor Alex Pentland said he doubts people will ever fully understand how algorithms work.
“I don’t think it is possible for these algorithms to be comprehensible in the way people think about what it means to ‘understand’,” Petland said. “I do think it’s possible to look at what they do and debate whether that’s what you want to have happen, using the performance along different dimensions, and using statistical analysis.”
Panelists all agreed that experts across disciplines should agree upon goals for algorithms to achieve, such as eliminating biases.
Nevertheless, Pentland said he thought algorithms and artificial intelligence should continue to be improved upon as society changes.
“But I actually think the important element is that any of these algorithms, like any law, should be continually evaluated, because the world changes,” Pentland said. “One wants to have continual oversight, to make sure that it’s doing what you intend for it to do.”

As pairs of students flock en masse to Harvard Square eateries after Datamatch, the Harvard Computer Society's annual matchmaking survey, business employees say the dates bring in welcome traffic.
This year, roughly three-quarters of Harvard undergraduates participated in Datamatch, which since 1994 has calculated College students' romantic compatibility based on a proprietary algorithm.
This year, the Computer Society partnered with Flour, Zinneken’s, Clover, Berryline, and El Jefe’s Tacqueria to provide matches' with free meals.
In order to schedule the date, each matched student must click a “match” button, which allows them to schedule a time and location for the date on the Computer Society's website. The group then provides each of the participating business a list of students eligible for free meals.
Cristina Caprar, an employee at Zinneken’s—which is currently giving out free waffles with toppings—said Datamatch can be a potent marketing strategy.
“It’s a really good advertising tool,” she said. “There are usually a lot of couples that come here because it’s a cozy environment, but this helps to make the business known.”
Berryline, a frozen yogurt chain also is offering two small servings of frozen yogurt with toppings during regular hours of operation. At El Jefe’s Taqueria, matches can claim four tacos and any two drinks past 1 p.m. Clover is offering a lunch special and two beverage combo from 2 to 4 p.m., and Flour is providing sandwiches and drinks.
Couples are able to book time slots from Feb. 15 through Feb. 21.
Shelby Johannemann, the manager at Flour’s new Harvard Square location, said they were hoping to use Datamatch to establish themselves in the area.
“Our business has been up and down since we’re a new location. Ten out of the 12 people came on Wednesday, so that was really good,” said Johannemann.
According to Johannemann, though, the algorithm doesn’t always ensure that sparks will fly between matched students.
“There was one couple with the one guy really into it and the girl was backing away,” said Johannemann. “But most of the people were really into it. Already when they were ordering they seemed to be really into it.”
Despite the nearly-5,000 students who registered, Caprar said Zinneken’s so far has seen less Datamatch traffic than last year.
“So far there were more dates last year but we just started, maybe it will be different over the weekend,” she said.
Johannemann said Flour will likely participate in Datamatch again next year.
“This is something we’re really interested in doing in the future,” she said.

UPDATED: February 17, 2017 at 1:13 p.m. 
Several members of Divest Harvard, a student activist group opposing Harvard’s financial ties to fossil fuels, quietly carried signs outside a Kennedy School film series screening sponsored in part by Shell Oil Company.
The screening, called “The Rational Middle Energy Series,” included a panel discussion with speakers from Shell, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the Kennedy School after the showing. Kennedy School staff and students organized the event, which was listed as “open to the public” online, required an advance RSVP to attend, and several people were turned away at the door.
Divest Harvard has for years taken aim at Harvard’s relationship to the fossil fuel industry. In 2015, protesters blockaded Massachusetts Hall, urging University President Drew G. Faust to divest Harvard's $35.7 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies. Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment, and said she strongly disapproved of Divest Harvard’s occupation of the building.
Geoffrey J. S. Supran, a Harvard postdoctoral fellow, was unable to enter the event. One film screening organizer told Supran—who is involved in Divest Harvard and climate change activism, but also said he wished to attend the talk—that he could not enter for security reasons.
Nikoleta Sremac, a project coordinator of the Geopolitics of Energy project, said Thursday's screening was ticketed like other Kennedy School events. Sremac said she helped organize the event, but was not involved in the decision to hold it in the first place.
Sremac said organizers became aware of the planned protest several days ago.
“I think we wanted to be aware of it and make sure everyone felt comfortable and felt like their voices were heard and expressed, but it didn’t affect how we organized the event or held it or anything like that,” Sremac said.
Demonstrators quietly handed orange flyers to people entering the building.
“We’re trying to hold the Kennedy School accountable for catering to donors and giving them such a public platform to promote their materials,” Divest Harvard member Maryssa R. Barron ’17 said.
Barron said the activists never planned to disrupt the event.
“We wanted to maintain an open discussion, so we were never planning on disrupting the event,” Barron said. “We wanted to be visible, like we are here.”
Medical School assistant professor James M. Recht did not attend the event, but said he helped organize the protest after he received an invitation to the screening. Recht wrote in an email that he thinks Harvard’s connection with Shell—which is among the sponsors of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program—is “worrisome.”
Meanwhile, Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in a statement that "[o]pen and rigorous discussion of current public issues from varied perspectives is at the core of HKS activities."

UPDATED: February 17, 2017 at 3:38 a.m. 
Speaking at a Miami high school, University President Drew G. Faust encouraged students to pursue higher education—from local community colleges to Ivy League institutions.
“Higher education encompasses more kinds of experiences, and more kinds of different experiences, than there are people in this room,” Faust told more than 100 Miami students, teachers, and administrators. “There is a place for every one of you.”
Faust also discussed the importance of higher education at an alumni event in Miami on Thursday. Faust has made similar trips for alumni events in locations across the globe, including in Berlin, Beijing, Mexico City, and New York, as part of the "Your Harvard" series.
Marilyn Holifield, a Law School graduate and a member of the Harvard Black Alumni Society of South Florida and the Harvard Club of Miami, helped organize the event. Faust visited the school—Miami Northwestern Senior High School—alongside Shaunte Butler ’14, who attended it before coming to Harvard.
Holifield told the Harvard Gazette that Faust’s visit was an opportunity “for Harvard to see the context of talent in an inner-city school, and to allow students to be inspired by the fact that Harvard cares enough to come down and spend time here, not only with the students, but with the teachers.”
In her remarks, Faust emphasized the importance of higher education for expanding intellectual pursuits and attaining a higher salary. She also drew on her own experiences as a woman attending college in the 1960s.
“As a young woman, I would not have been able to apply to Princeton or Yale—they had no women students then—so it was unimaginable that a woman could become president of a place like Harvard,” Faust said.
Faust added that at her alma mater, the all-female Bryn Mawr College, she felt like she was a “full member of the community.”
“I think that helped me to imagine what women could be and to not see the obstacles that were obviously there in my path, but to be able to see something that carried my sights beyond them,” Faust said. “It made me imagine a career that seemed unimaginable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cabot House’s dining hall closed Wednesday afternoon and evening after a sewage pipe in a nearby bathroom broke Tuesday night, producing an odor that many Cabot students called foul.
Amanda Pepper, Cabot’s House Administrator, wrote in an email Wednesday that the dining hall would be closed due to "a strange smell" from this pipe. She added that while the dining hall was closed, students were welcome to eat in neighboring Currier and Pforzheimer Houses.
Matthew Li '19, who lives in Cabot House, said Pepper’s description of the smell was an “understatement.”
“It was just absolutely horrible.  It was so terrible,” he said.  “The d-hall was completely empty.  It smelled like excrement.”
Li added that the stench was not contained to the dining hall, and eventually spread to nearby entryways and Cabot Cafe.
“Each of the entryways directly on each side of the dhall smells terrible,” he said.  “They had all the doors closed so the smell couldn't get in and people were stuck in the refuge of Cabot Cafe.”
Despite the stench, residents said they were pleased by House staff’s response to the issue.
Christopher Cruz ’17, another Cabot resident, said he was personally impressed by the House’s fast response.
“The cleanup crew and the crew who were working to fix the pipes up have done an outstanding job. The dining hall is back open already so I really have to applaud them for their efforts,” Cruz said.
Cruz added that spirit and a sense of camaraderie in the House was generally positive, and that House staff adjusted but did not cancel events planned in the dining hall during its closure.
“The Cabot community was very quick at reacting and responding to the situation at hand and the events that were planned for the dining hall, whether they were events led by tutors, or by Hoco were very quickly moved,” Cruz said.
“I am very proud to say that the Cabot community has stayed strong despite this incident,” he added.
Li also praised the house administration’s response and the emails updates he received over the course of Wednesday afternoon.  Nonetheless, he said even though the dining hall now smells fine, the hallway containing the pipe that was leaking still smells terrible.
The broken pipe has since been repaired and Cabot’s dining hall reopened for breakfast Thursday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Braving the freezing winter, a group of Harvard undergraduates are training for April’s Boston Marathon to raise money for the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Summer Urban Program as part of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge.
The Summer Urban Program is a network of ten summer academic enrichment camps for students aged 5 to 19 from low-income backgrounds, and is managed by the PBHA. For more than a decade, the Harvard College Marathon Challenge—comprised of students, faculty, and alumni—have raised thousands for causes through PBHA and other organizations like the American Medical Athletic Association.
For Kruti B. Vora ’17, a PBHA officer, the charity is the main reason for her participation in the run.
“I’ve been volunteering with PBHA since freshman fall and I have a mentee who has gone through [the Summer Urban Program], so having this first-hand experience and working with these kids really means alot to me,” Vora said.
While many are running to raise money for the same cause, others said they had additional motivations.
Joyce C. Zhou ’17 said she is running the marathon to challenge herself.
“I’ve never run the marathon before and thought it it would be a fun way to test my physical limits,” Zhou said. “I’ve seen the impact that it has on kids in the Boston.”
For many runners, the marathon is an opportunity to honor the spirit of the city of Boston and remember marathon bombings in 2013.
“My Visitas was cancelled after the bombing. My freshman year I saw the marathon and it was incredible and I became inspired by that,” Avinash Saraf ’17 said. “So it’s really been a dream come true to run the Boston Marathon.”
While a few, like Saraf and Vora, have previously run the Boston Half Marathon, both Zhou and Naomi G. Asimow ‘18 are new to the sport.
“We don’t get a ton of guidance. We figure it out on our own, but it’s nice to have a community of people also running the marathon,” Asimow  said, adding that she follows a training plan she found on the internet.
Zhou added that her training plan often makes it hard to manage a schedule.
“It’s a challenge managing everything going on with senior year and school work but ultimately building in time in my schedule to run has been good,” she said.
“You surprise yourself at how easily your body copes with increasing distances and conditions. As you go week by week it doesn’t feel that different,” Zhou said.
Vora said the excitement extended past just the physical challenge.
“I’m not running to run an incredible time. I’m running mostly just for myself, for the the city, and for what PBHA means to me,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With the Cornell men’s basketball team trekking to Cambridge for a Saturday evening showdown with the Crimson, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention the 2009-2010 Big Red team that helped put Ivy League basketball back into the national conversation.
Over Presidents’ Day Weekend in 2010, Steve Donahue’s squad split its two weekend Ivy League contests, getting blown out by Penn on Friday night before bouncing back to edge Princeton the following evening. The contests seven years ago were some of the only hiccups for a Cornell team that suffered just five losses all season, won 13 conference games by an average of 18.5 points per game, and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. In the seven years since, the tables have drastically turned for the Big Red and the rest of the Ivy League.
Cornell’s golden era, a three-year run that provided the the institution high above Cayuga’s waters three of its five all-time NCAA Tournament appearances, ended in the blink of an eye. Sixteen days after his team was bounced by Kentucky in the NCAA Tournament, head coach Steve Donahue bolted to take the same position at Boston College. The Big Red handed the 2011 Ivy League crown to Harvard, a team it beat by 36 when it visited Ithaca the year before, and Princeton. Since its Sweet Sixteen appearance, Cornell has won 29 Ivy League games in six-plus seasons and just hired a new coach. For context, the Big Red won 38 in Donahue’s final three seasons in Ithaca.
While a rising tide has lifted all eight Ivy League boats over the past seven years, Cornell has definitely not kept up with the pace of rivals Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Despite the improved rosters and overall level of play in conference play, no Ancient Eight team has made it out of the NCAA Tournament’s first weekend since 2010 and only the Crimson’s 2013-2014 team and the 2015-2016 Bulldogs squad have been able to match the Big Red’s 13-1 record in conference play.
Few would argue that the level of play in the league on any given Friday or Saturday night has gone up. Teams are prying recruits away from the Big East, ACC, and Pac-12 rather than from the America East and Atlantic Ten. Princeton won 22 games last season and Columbia (Columbia!) won the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. It’s no coincidence that the Ivy League decided to add a conference tournament at a time when the league believes it could receive an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. So, why is Cornell the only Ivy League team since 1979 to appear in the Sweet Sixteen?
The Big Red’s 2009-2010 team had many of the ingredients a mid-major team needs to make a deep run in March. To begin, Donahue is a savage when it comes to scheduling tough non-conference opponents. That reality largely lost him his job at BC, but for the 2009-2010 season, the rigorous nonconference slate worked wonders. Cornell opened the season at Alabama, traveled to UMass, played in the Legends Classic in Philadelphia, took on No. 10 Syracuse and top-ranked Kansas on the road, and had tilts against the Big East’s Seton Hall and St. John’s. That is what you call a nonconference schedule. For context, the eight Ivy League teams have combined to play 109 nonconference games this season and a whopping three have come against teams ranked in the Top 25.
Secondly, the Big Red knew how to win in the Ivy League. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker often alludes to the fact that one Ivy League team can beat any other in the conference on any given night. Given the back-to-back games and importance of styles of play and matchups, a win, especially on the road, is never a sure thing. For instance, Penn steamrolled Cornell and beat Columbia last weekend just a week after getting manhandled by Princeton and losing to a previously winless Dartmouth team.
Donahue’s crew did not really have that problem. While the average Ivy League team in 2017 is deeper and more talented than in 2010, the Big Red wasn’t playing the 2010 or 2017 edition of Dartmouth every weekend. Princeton went 11-1 against teams not named Cornell and Jeremy Lin ’10 led the Crimson to what was at the time the most successful season in school history. Apart from the loss at the Palestra, the Big Red did not really take any nights off once conference play arrived. Rather than letting Penn hang around after it beat the Tigers for its biggest win of the season, Cornell proceeded to spank the Quakers, 68-48. It blew out teams it was supposed to blow out and won close games even though it didn’t need to very often.
Thirdly, and most importantly, the Big Red was experienced. Cornell’s senior class was one of the most prolific in Ivy League history. The team’s eight seniors went a remarkable 88-33 over their four seasons in Ithaca, brought home three conference championships, and lost only nine Ivy League games. While underclassmen made significant contributions throughout the season, the Big Red’s best players were its seniors. That’s not to say that experience alone was what gave Cornell personnel advantages. Jeff Foote transferred in from St. Bonaventure while forward Mark Coury, who was a reserve for Donahue, started for Kentucky. The team was loaded with three-star recruits from across the country.
Ryan Wittman was the Ivy League’s Player of the Year and Foote was the conference’s Defensive Player of the Year. Louis Dale was the third fourth-year from the Big Red on the Ivy First Team and all three players were unanimous picks. Wittman was also an honorable mention All-American. Wittman, Foote, Dale, and the rest of Cornell’s seniors had been to the NCAA Tournament in the two seasons before their 2010 run. Fifth-seeded Temple was the team playing with jitters when the two met in Jacksonville, and the rest of the nation saw what everyone in Ithaca had grown accustomed to when the Big Red blew the doors off of fourth-seeded Wisconsin two nights later. Its challenging nonconference slate and veteran leadership allowed Cornell to thrive in close games. The Big Red was 11-1 in games decided by fewer than 10 points, with the only loss coming on the road against No. 1 Kansas.
Fast-forward to 2017. A young but talented Harvard team has been inconsistent at the beginnings and ends of games. The Crimson has trailed at halftime of six of its eight conference games but holds a 6-2 league record. After conducting a clinic on how to blow a lead against Princeton at home two Saturdays ago, Harvard closed out Yale by getting stops on defense and hitting big shots last weekend. The inconsistency has been visible across the league. The Tigers, the team to beat in the conference this season, hold a perfect 8-0 record but nearly lost to cellar-dwelling Dartmouth and boast Bucknell as their best nonconference win. Despite Yale’s win over Baylor in last season’s NCAA Tournament, most sites project the Ivy champ (currently penciled in as Princeton) as a 14 seed. An Ivy League team has not been ranked as a 14 seed or worse since a 20-10 Crimson team made the Big Dance in 2013.
While none of this year’s Ancient Eight teams much resemble the Cornell team of 2009-2010, an appearance by an Ivy League school in the NCAA Tournament’s second weekend does not seem too far off. The Ivy League’s improved level of play may hurt conference win-loss records at the top but is good for the league in the long run if teams can start scheduling nonconference games like Donahue.
Harvard is sitting at second in the conference and has shown that it can beat (and lose to) anyone despite being led largely by freshmen. Yale’s freshmen and sophomores have shown that trips to Payne Whitney Gymnasium will be miserable for reasons other than the fact that the arena is located in New Haven for years to come. Jim Engles has Columbia in line for an Ivy Tournament berth despite having very few players who logged significant college minutes before this season. Princeton is chock full of seniors but Devin Cannady is arguably the league’s most talented player as a sophomore. And who knows, maybe Donahue will be able to work his magic at Penn. Brian Earl may be the second coming of Donahue in Ithaca and Cornell’s freshman class could go on to win 88 games over the next three-plus years, but I’m not holding my breath on that one. However, it does look like the Ivy League may not have to wait another 40 years to see one of its teams playing at the Staples Center or Madison Square Garden rather than the BOK Center in Tulsa or Boise’s Taco Bell Arena.
Now to the picks:
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
The last iteration of this matchup was pretty strange in retrospect. The Lions took a lead as big as 19 in the second half against a Harvard team that had won 10 of its last 11 and was still undefeated in conference. While the Crimson made a run late in the second, the game was all Columbia.
Come Friday, however, Columbia comes into Lavietes having lost three of its last four, including a loss to what was then a one-win Penn squad. Harvard, for its part, has won three of its last four since, and took down Yale to give the Bulldogs their first home loss in nearly two years.
Delving even deeper into Columbia basketball, we’ve discovered that the Columbia Spectator lovingly refers to the team as ‘the Light Blue’—we realize Harvard’s mascot is a color, but referring to yourself as the Light Blue when your mascot is the king of the jungle is nothing short of a consistent exercise in self-deprecation.
Maybe the Lions could win on Friday, but we sure as hell don’t think the Light Blue will.
Pick: Harvard
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
So if Columbia keeps doing its Light Blue thing the race for the four spot in March’s conference tournament would have the potential to be a lot more interesting and this formerly irrelevant game has potential playoff implications for both teams.
As it stands, there’s a four-way tie for fifth place in the conference and the Lions have looked pretty Light Blue as of late. Given this, a win here would give either team a pretty significant boost when it comes to keeping its hopes of going to the Palestra alive.
In an effort to better understand the implications of what a playoff berth would mean for either of these teams, we looked to The Dartmouth, an old hag of a newspaper is there ever was one. As it stands when we write this on Thursday, February 16, the top headline in The Dartmouth goes as follows: Lodge Will Be Completed Next Fall.
If the construction of a lodge is front headline news in Hanover we think a playoff berth would probably be great for all those poor, hard alcohol-deprived people at Dartmouth.
Given the fact that their season started with nine consecutive losses, though, it would be tough to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Pick: Cornell
PENN AT BROWN
This one is a lot like the Cornell-Dartmouth game: two teams with identical conference records hoping Columbia can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory down the stretch. In Penn’s defense, it had some of the league’s toughest opponents at the start of its conference slate, but this one is really a toss-up.
To figure this one out we decided we would do what we did for the Princeton-Columbia game last week. We took to Google and simply asked, “In a fight, would a Quaker or a Bear win.” While the results were inconclusive, we did find a great video with the title of “Quaker Mascot Flirting with Brown Bear.” Definitely worth a watch if you literally have nothing better to do. Not really, actually.
While we don’t think romance will blossom on the court on Friday, we do think your typical Quaker would be mauled by a Brown Bear.
Pick: Brown
PRINCETON AT YALE
There’s a lot to say here. Princeton rolls in undefeated, but up until last Saturday, Yale hadn’t lost a game at home in nearly two years. The Tigers are likely one of the most experienced teams in the conference while the Bulldogs are a combination of veteran and underclassman talent. Princeton is probably still pretty bummed about choking against Harvard last season. The list goes on and on.
While we didn’t bother checking whether a Bulldog stands a chance against a Tiger, we did find a list of ten things you should never say to a friend with a Bulldog. Number one was simply “Bulldog’s have a face only a mother could love.”
The same could be said of Yalies, but perhaps all that resentment could boil over on Friday night.
Pick: Yale
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
Maybe the king of the jungle will emerge from its Light Blue phase on Saturday.
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON AT BROWN
A headline from the Daily Princetonian earlier this month read as follows: They hate us ‘cause they ain’t us.
We’re struggling to understand why a school whose self attributed fun fact is, “The first-recorded use of the now common understanding of the word campus, in 1774, was generally attributed to Princeton’s sixth president John Witherspoon,” would think people are jealous of it.
That’s besides the point. There’s no home court advantage when you’re playing in a high school gym.
Pick: Princeton
PENN AT YALE
A Quaker couldn’t hurt a Bulldog even if he wanted to.
Pick: Yale
CORNELL AT HARVARD
In what may be the worst mascot-related matchup in the Ivy League, we think the word ‘Big’ really detracts from Cornell. As of recent, the only ‘Big’ thing to happen in Ithaca is a power outage.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Coming off a tough weekend at the Ivy League Championships that saw neither squad come back to Cambridge with an Ancient Eight title, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams both capped off their regular seasons by capturing their tenth-consecutive respective Beanpot titles. Since the Beanpot’s inception in 2008, the Crimson men and women have both claimed the sole share of the crown every year.
“Some of us are still recovering from last weekend, [and] a lot of us still haven’t even regained our voices,” women’s co-captain and foil fencer Liana Yamin said. “But we still came out and fought hard. One of our fencers, [freshman] Duncan [Rheingans-Yoo], even had to switch weapons, and he still went 8-1.”
Rheingans-Yoo switched from foil to epee for Wednesday’s bouts due to the illness that kept sophomore Jonathan Gill, one of Harvard’s regular epee fencers, sidelined for the tournament.
“Duncan had fenced a little bit of epee in his free time and because we had extra foil [fencers], we decided to have him fence epee,” junior co-captain and saber fencer Eric Zhao said.
Even though Harvard had won the Beanpot ten years running, the teams did not let that distract or pressure them and treated the event as business as usual.
“Everyone came into this tournament with the mindset of ‘Just gotta go as hard as we can,’” Zhao said. “And we knew if we did, just like the [previous] years, we would come away with the title.”
MEN’S FENCING
The Crimson dominated Brandeis, MIT and Boston College on Wednesday, winning each of its matches by more than 13 bouts.
In its first match of the day against Brandeis, the Crimson cleaned up, 20-7. The team picked up six points in epee, dominated 8-1 in foil, and went 7-2 in saber.
Sophomore Eli Dershwitz has led Harvard with his saber all year, including a 14-1 performance at Ivy League Championships, and he continued to do so at the Beanpot. Dershwitz went into this tournament with a 28-5 record and a plus-76 touch differential for this year.
The Crimson carried that momentum over to their next match against their rivals down the road, the Engineers. Harvard toppled their Massachusetts Avenue opposition by a 22-5 mark, going 6-3 in epee, a perfect 9-0 in foil, an impressive feat considering the group was without their leading foil fencer, Duncan Rheingans-Yoo, and 7-2 in saber.
Rheingans-Yoo, rather than competing with his usual weapon, foil, picked up the epee for this tournament to fill in for Gill and impressed with a 8-1 record for his day.
To finish off the evening, Harvard topped the Eagles, winning by a score of 22-5. The team finished 7-2 in epee, another 9-0 in foil, and 6-3 in saber.
“After what happened at the Ivies it was a good way for us to bounce back…[and] to prove we still had it…and that we’re still a very capable team,” Zhao said.
WOMEN’S FENCING
As the team prepares for the NCAA Tournament, the Beanpot offered the team one last chance to tune up and build some momentum going into its final test of the season.
“We know that we’ll have to work as a team [going forward], so it’s good to see that we can get consistently strong results after a somewhat rocky season,” Yamin said. “It’s great to have this big win to give us some momentum going into the NCAA Regional Championships.”
To start off the day, Harvard put on a dominant 23-4 display against MIT. The epee squad went 6-3, saber went for the perfect 9-0, and foil came close with an 8-1 performance.
The Crimson posted a similarly commanding result against Brandeis at 21-6, with epee going 7-2, foil 6-3, and saber 8-1.
The final match of the day was for the title and set Harvard against the host Boston College. A much closer match, Harvard still prevailed 16-11 with epee posting a 5-4 margin, saber a 6-3 one, and foil finishing 5-4 as well.
The next contests for both teams will be the NCAA Regional Championships on March 12 at Yale.
