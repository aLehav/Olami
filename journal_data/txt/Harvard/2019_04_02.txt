After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few years signify as much American transformation and upheaval as 1964. America was still suffering from the grief and aftershock of JFK’s assassination. Newly sworn-in president Lyndon B. Johnson signed the ground-breaking Civil Rights Act of 1964, sent troops to Vietnam, and entered a re-election campaign against the staunchly conservative Republican Barry Goldwater. China successfully tested its first nuclear bomb, skyrocketing Cold War tensions. The world was awhirl — particularly after the notably reserved “cookie-cutter” decade of the 1950s, which valued stability and conformity. 1964 marked a drastic shift, bringing issues of class inequality, institutionalized racism, gender roles, sexuality, and the growing generational gap to the forefront.
It is obviously wrong, however, to think about these huge political milestones as merely isolated to history curricula. The interplay between politics and pop culture are dynamic and inextricably linked, so the increasing conflicts and nail-biting tensions of Johnson’s presidency are reflected in what Americans watched, what they wore, and what they ultimately rooted for in this decisive year.
Kubrick Makes Nuclear War Funny
A movie about incompetent leaders allowing for the complete nuclear destruction of life on earth — it’s hard to imagine that this could be funny. But whereas most filmmakers avoided anti-Cold War commentary and the anticipated backlash, director Stanley Kubrick created a timeless classic in 1964 in the form of his dark, sarcastic comedy, “Dr. Strangelove: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.”
Mercilessly mocking the ridiculousness of “deterrence” and “mutually assured destruction,” Kubrick shined the light on American politicians treating the Cold War like an inconsequential game while using humor to help the medicine go down. No line better encapsulates the biting derision and goofy humor of the film quite like President Merkin Muffley’s “Gentleman, you can’t fight in here! This is the War Room!” In a year full of blockbusters like “Mary Poppins,” “My Fair Lady,” and “Goldfinger,” the polarizing “Dr. Strangelove” still managed to be a commercial success despite its controversial subject matter, grossing $6 million with a budget of less than two million. It proves the power of satire to stir the pot and raise public awareness, even if it doesn’t present an immediate solution.
Television’s Rise of the Supernatural
After a decade of conventional sitcoms like “Father Knows Best” and “Leave it to Beaver” — which focus on the “normal,” nuclear family — the 1964 TV season must have seemed like Halloween had come early. All within the same year, networks ABC and CBS released “Bewitched,” “The Munsters,” and “The Addams Family,” bringing witches, monsters, and all things creepy and kooky to TV screens all across America.
It might seem like a strange coincidence that two separate channels independently created shows about monster families, and that’s because it’s not — “The Munsters” was CBS’s conscious decision to try to compete with rival ABC. Nevertheless, this consumerism in action does nothing to detract from the the two shows’ ambitious themes and risk-taking. Both seemed to present an interesting twist on the “typical” American homelife and to question the definition of normalcy, but “The Addams Family” has left a particularly lasting legacy despite a short two-season lifespan.
Beyond its infectiously catchy theme song, the Addams Family boldly embraces the macabre and weird, with characters who enjoy stretching on the torture rack or billow smoke on command. They present a rather radical perspective on daily life, yet what makes the show so subtly meaningful is the way members of the Addams Family still show love for one another and respect for their guests, defying any preconceived notions based on their gothic appearances.
So Long to ’50s Fashion
The legacy of conservative house dresses, kitten heels, and modest accessorizing that defined the 1950s trickled into the early 1960s. With her pillbox hats, boxy jackets, and overall couture, sophisticated, style, First Lady Jackie Kennedy was America’s leading fashion inspiration during her husband’s administration, helping extend the ’50s ideals of both glamour and reserve into the new decade. However, after Kennedy’s tragic assassination and the upheaval of 1964, new fashion icons began to take Jackie O’s place and radically shift the way that women, in particular, dressed.
Taking the place of Paris as the fashion trendsetter of the world, London took control in the mid-60s in the form of the subculture called “modernist” or “mod” for short. Standing in sharp contrast to the modest, somber outfits of the previous few years that kept women covered up, the Baby Boomers coming of age opted for bold colors, geometric patterns, and mini skirts, valuing exploration and experimentation through their clothing. Mary Quant, an influential British fashion designer at the time, popularized both the short, sleeveless shift dress as well as “hot pants,” which might today be described as “booty shorts.” Women showed off more skin than ever before and began to embrace their sexuality as best exemplified by French actress and model Brigitte Bardot. Putting the philosophy “anything goes” into action, her tousled yet stylish hair, off-the-shoulder neckline, and pink gingham wedding dress set a powerful example for youth at this time. Perhaps the most extreme example of ’60s fashion as a form a revolt against the conformity and domesticity imposed on women of the ’50s is designer Rudi Gernreich and his controversial monokini. As an advocate for the sexual revolution, Gernreich created this completely topless bathing suit, startling American households with his attempt to celebrate the female form.
Music’s “British Invasion”
It would be a crime to discuss 1964’s cultural revolutions without mentioning the arrival of British rock in America, a pivotal phenomenon coined “The British Invasion.” Although it was intended as a mere joke, when “The Jack Paar Program” aired some concert footage from an up-and-coming British band known as The Beatles on Jan. 3, 1964, about 30 million Americans tuned in, foreshadowing “Beatlemania” on the horizon.
Within a few weeks, the Beatles’ first smash hit “I Wanna Hold Your Hand” vaulted to the top the U.S. charts, electrifying the youth, upsetting the parents, and marking England’s first huge success at staking its claim in the rock music genre in America. “Beatlemania” continued to accelerate at an almost unbelievable rate and when John, Paul, George, and Ringo all made their first appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” on Feb. 9, an estimated 45 percent of America’s population tuned in. After issuing their album, “Meet the Beatles!,” the group held all the top five slots on the U.S. charts, a totally unprecedented musical achievement.
Although this British band from Liverpool completely dominated the music industry in 1964, their success opened a window of opportunity for a plethora of other rocks groups like The Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, and The Animals in the following years. Some critics argue that the “British Invasion” choked out other forms of music in America such as the folk revival and country music and yanked popularity from most other popular idols at the time. Regardless, this musical milestone completely redirected the course of music, internationalizing the rebellious genre of rock and legitimizing a few musicians playing guitar and drums in a garage and writing their own songs as a veritable and unstoppable expression of art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The turn of the millennium — an exciting yet tumultuous time for many — was met with several incredible works and innovations: It brought us the deeply philosophical yet action-packed thrills of “The Matrix,” the enigmatic romance of “American Beauty,” the return of the blockbuster space-opera series "Star Wars” with “Episode I - The Phantom Menace," and the intensely moving tale “Boys Don’t Cry.” However, it’s important to remember the significant — and substantial — work produced in 1999 in the world of animated film, a domain that was expanding more rapidly than ever before, concurrent with the advent of many digital technologies.
“Tarzan”
This adaptation of the story “Tarzan of the Apes” by Edgar Rice Burroughs — the first animated film version ever — was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation, meeting with commercial success and critical acclaim for its music (a combination of Phil Collins’ songs and Mark Mancina’s orchestration) and its animation (which was so precise that Tarzan became the first Disney character with properly portrayed human musculature) in particular. In fact, Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic Roger Ebert called “Tarzan” a movie which pushed the “envelope of animation,” citing a freedom of movement unimaginable in live action.
“The Iron Giant”
Telling the story of a boy who befriends a large robot during the Cold War, “The Iron Giant” marked Brad Bird’s directorial debut. Bird went on to direct other universally acclaimed animated films, including “The Incredibles” and “Ratatouille.” Though the movie did not succeed at the box office (making back less than half its budget), critics praised it highly for its beautiful animation and for its thoughtful, delicate portrayal of human relations.
“Fantasia 2000”
A sequel to Disney’s original “Fantasia” (1940), this film is comprised of a series of animated vignettes set to pieces of classical music, featuring world-class musicians like Angela Lansbury, Itzhak Perlman, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The animation used for the film was created by juxtaposing traditional methods with computer-generated imaging and designed to be compatible with IMAX theatres, making it the first animated feature-length film to have this format.
“Toy Story 2”

“Toy Story 2,” produced by Pixar Animation Studios, was originally intended to be a small-scale, home-released sequel to the wildly popular 1995 film “Toy Story.” However, the story — of a group of anthropomorphic toys attempting to rescue their toy-cowboy friend tempted by the prospect of eternal life — grew too promising to limit to the living-room television. It was released in theaters to widespread acclaim for its innovative storytelling that carries powerful themes through an equally powerful allegory, being one of the only sequels to ever, arguably, surpass the original. In fact, it is one of the only films to receive a 100 percent from Rotten Tomatoes, serving to show that animated films — often brushed aside from the limelight of live-action movies — can be of equal, if not superior, quality.

Trigger Warning: Sexual Abuse, Pedophilia
Few people have had as great a cultural impact as Michael Jackson. From the start of his musical career in 1964, the frequently dubbed “King of Pop” has made waves both in and out of the music industry. Even today, 10 years after his death, Jackson continues to be the subject of media coverage and discussion — though for reasons that are far less than admirable. Since 1993, Jackson’s career has been notably marked by multiple allegations of sexual abuse against young boys. “Leaving Neverland” tells the story of just two of the pop star's most recent accusers: Wade Robson and James Safechuck. The two-part HBO documentary gives a hauntingly powerful, if noticeably partial, glimpse into the life of an enigmatic cultural icon, as well as the devastating effects of child sexual abuse.
“Leaving Neverland” has a relatively simple premise — interviews with Robson, Safechuck, and their immediate family members are interspersed with corresponding footage from the 80s. These interviews allow Robson and Safechuck to tell their stories from beginning to end, giving voice to those most often overlooked in celebrity scandals: the survivors. Accordingly, Episode One begins not with the allegations, but with the complicated series of events that led to each boy befriending the notoriously anti-social star. Director Dan Reed portrays Robson and Safechuck as boys with big dreams, and their respective meetings with Jackson appear to hold the key to achieving them. The courting process that follows is haunting: Through grooming and subtle manipulations, Jackson ensures that both boys and their families come to depend on him completely. This contextualization makes the first alleged incident of sexual abuse, a good 40 minutes into Episode One, feel all the more devastating a betrayal.
Robson and Safechuck do not hold back in their descriptions of the abuse they suffered, but these disturbing accounts are not the primary focus of the documentary. Instead, “Leaving Neverland” largely centers on the consequences and events that followed the instances of sexual abuse. Episode Two delves into the first allegations against Jackson in 1993 by another one of Jackson’s child companions, Jordan Chandler. Once again, Robson and Safechuck detail the manipulation tactics Jackson used to ensure they would stay in line and defend him in court when allegation turned to legal action. “He told me that if anyone finds out, his life would be over and my life would be over,” Safechuck says. As such, both survivors continued to defend Jackson. By the time Jackson was accused again in 2005, however, the now young adults’ support had begun to run thin, and his death in 2009 brought a sense of relief.
Perhaps most striking about this documentary is the fact that, despite the series’ focus on his scandals, Jackson is largely left lurking in the background. Jackson functions just as elusively in the series as he did in real life. His iconic music is only played when absolutely necessary — such as in scenes where the accusers find themselves at concerts — reflecting the directorial choice to not give Jackson any more airtime than required. Similarly, Jackson’s spoken voice is rarely heard, despite the abundance of interviews and speeches available. These decisions contribute to the overall feeling that this documentary is is truly about the survivors. Michael Jackson’s story has been told time after time. “Leaving Neverland” is not his turn.
With the documentary’s focus on survivors and lasting consequences comes an emphasis on Jackson as not only an abuser, but also a family destroyer. The only people interviewed besides Robson and Safechuck themselves are their mothers, wives, siblings, and grandparents. Their testimonies shed light on the secondhand emotional toil that this scandal caused them. At times, the documentary appears to go off topic in detailing the relationship issues between Robson’s parents or his father’s subsequent mental health struggles. However, it quickly becomes clear that these events are direct repercussion are direct repercussion of Jackson’s alleged abuse.
Things only get worse when the families discover the abuse that has been going on right beneath their noses. In fact, Jackson’s death occurs halfway through Episode Two, with the remaining hour focusing almost entirely on the families’ reactions to the revelations that the rumors of abuse were, in fact, true. The mothers, in particular, are shown to suffer not just from the troubles their families have been dragged through, but also from the guilt they feel for the role they played. The survivors’ wives and siblings also wonder how any parent could ever think it was okay for a grown man to sleep in the same bed as their child. “I could forgive Michael one day if I just write him off as sick,” Joy, Robson’s mother, says. “But I’ll never forgive myself.”
The documentary also pays great attention to the trauma inflicted on the survivors’ mental health. As those most affected by these incidents narrate their sides, the stories told range from more explicit discussion of depression and PTSD to more implicit signs of their trauma — a particularly striking example is that Safechuck frequently speaks in the second person singular, as he cannot mentally put himself back in the abusive situation he was once in. In this way, the documentary points a spotlight at the ways in which momentary incidents can have a lasting impact on one’s well-being, as well as the internal conflicts that lead to survivors’ reluctance to come out immediately with the truth.
No one should go into “Leaving Neverland” expecting an impartial depiction of Jackson’s actions. The documentary clearly holds the allegations as true, and it makes no effort to hear from Jackson’s supporters, like his other young companion, Macaulay Culkin. The show also quickly and superficially brushes off the common criticism that these allegations are simply a gambit for money. In this way, it fails as a piece of investigative journalism — as a chilling representation of the effects that abuse can have on everyone involved, however, it shines. “Leaving Neverland” is extremely effective in convincing viewers that the allegations are true by eliciting emotional responses. In the end, “Leaving Neverland” is not just the story of a celebrity and the charges against him. It is a story of trauma, resilience, and most importantly, justice — or lack thereof.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clarissa Jacobson has been acting since she was a child but holds screenwriting in a special place in her heart. After traveling to international film festivals such as the South African Horrorfest and Glasgow Horror Festival to promote her script, she recently released her short film, “Lunch Ladies” on Amazon Prime. “Lunch Ladies” follows two mediocre lunch ladies with a mischievous culinary plan after one student insults their Johnny Depp obsession. Since its release, “Lunch Ladies” has garnered international acclaim, appearing at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival, and earned over thirty awards. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Jacobson to discuss her short film and the process of combining comedy and horror.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get into filmmaking and what is your background working in film?
Clarissa Jacobson: My entire life up until four years ago, I thought I was an actress. I always wanted to be an actress since I was a kid. At Indiana University, I majored in theater and telecommunications and then I went to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York and majored theater. What happened was I discovered that my true love was creating characters. By a weird series of events, I ended up taking this class during a writing salon and I discovered that my passion was screenwriting.
THC: What spurred your inspiration for the “Lunch Ladies” short?
CJ: Donna Pieroni, who plays the lead in [the show], and I were out to dinner and she said to me, “God, there’s so few roles for two women that are dead — who are over the age of 21 in LA where everything is about being 19, 20, 21.” And she said, “I always go to auditions with this other woman and we’re friends and I really like her but in fact, it’s kind of competition because we know one of us would get the role. I wish someone would write a really good role about lunch ladies because then we can both get the role.” And I told her I’d love to write a movie about lunch ladies.
She was in [a production of] “Sweeney Todd” at the same time, and giving a little spoiler away here, I said, “Wouldn’t it be funny to do a spoof on ‘Sweeney Todd’?” But there are so many spoofs made about “Sweeney Todd.” Now, what about making it about the fact that I’m stealing the idea from “Sweeney Todd,” so that [the lunch ladies] are fangirls obsessing over Johnny Depp. And they get the idea to do what they do because Johnny Depp was in [the movie adaptation of] “Sweeney Todd.”
Most indie shorts have a certain vibe. They are super heartfelt and shed a light on something really bad like global warming. One day I was meditating, and it came to me to make “Lunch Ladies” a genre film, but that was so weird. Then, I started getting so excited about it. It straddles the genres of comedy and horror. It was not your typical indie film, but it was really what I wanted to do.
THC: Was it harder to write for comedy or horror? How did you decide to mix the two genres together?
CJ: I think that comedy is the hardest thing to do in the world. I feel like comedy and horror are two sides of a coin because both have heightened emotions and are hard to do well. Drama gets a lot of love, but honestly, and I like writing drama too, drama is easier than comedy and horror. In comedy, you’ve got to deliver. There’s so much pain in comedy, and that’s what makes it funny.
I discovered horror by accident. I don’t like blood. I don’t like thinking about horror. And my teacher said to me, “If you’re scared to write, you have to write it.” It turned out to be a great script, and I had so much fun writing it. My teacher was saying that when you write dark, or when you go to a place where you never go to, like if there’s a murder happening, it’s super creative because you never go there in real life. I love writing horror now — it's my favorite thing to write. And “Lunch Ladies” is comedy horror, so that kind of melded my love of comedy too.
THC: What has international reception to “Lunch Ladies” been like? Has the reception been different than in the US?
CJ: It’s been incredible. When I first started this, one of the things people would tell me was that comedy doesn’t play overseas. I had to disprove that because I wanted a producer who would make this movie and didn’t want to make movies that were only going to play in the US. Comedies do play overseas.
There are countries that like your films more than other countries, but what you find is that there is a human bond. We all laugh at the same things. We cry at the same things. “Lunch Ladies” played a ton in France, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, Italy, Netherlands, South America. It played everywhere. It’s because I took the chance and wanted to enter foreign festivals and figure out to get subtitles done that I have 10 different subtitles and distribution around the world. People in other countries love American movies, just like I love French and Scandinavian movies.
THC: I was particularly drawn to your website’s “Hairnet Club” as a tribute to the main characters. Could you speak more about that and when that started?
CJ: At festivals as a part of the swag, I’d give away these hairnets. One time, someone opened [a hairnet] up and took a picture. And all of a sudden, it occurred to me that it would be funny to have a Hairnet Club.
People started sending pictures. For the first one, a woman sent a picture with a cat with a hair net. It was incredible. I got a couple of cats, a couple of dogs, and then people. This guy from the UK sent me a really ridiculous picture — with two lunch ladies with hair nets and bloody cleavers.
I’m always trying to think out of the box on how I can promote [the movie], how can I be different, and how can I really encapsulate the brand and feel of the film which is all about being the underdog and other crazy things.
THC: Now that you’ve spent so much time with “Lunch Ladies,” what is your ideal cafeteria lunch?
CJ: Cinnamon rolls definitely have to be there. Now I’m kind of a health nut, so I’d probably want a seaweed salad, sushi — and cinnamon roll, of course, on the side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spend five minutes on Facebook or Youtube, and you’ll enter a dark hole of never ending videos of cute puppies, weirdly satisfying soap and slime, choreographed dances, recipes and more. Some of the most popular videos, however, that start trending on Facebook or YouTube are the ones that make viewers cry and sob. Everyone’s been there, sitting alone in your dorm room, rethinking life choices, and feeling bad about yourself. All of a sudden, Facebook or YouTube is pulled up, and the tears start pouring out. No shame at all. In fact, here are five of the best videos to get a good cry out.
1. Soldier Surprising Son at Taekwondo Practice
Soldier coming home videos always hit a nerve as families are finally reunited with their loved ones. While there’s thousands of these videos floating around on the Internet and plenty of compilations on YouTube, this specific video is one of the most emotional surprises. The soldier’s son Luca is blindfolded during a taekwondo practice, and his dad, Staff Sergeant Rob Cesternino, has just returned home from Jordan and Syria after almost a year abroad. After Cesternino hops into the practice and starts saying Luca’s nickname, his son finally realizes that it’s his dad that he’s fighting. Tears will immediately fall when you hear Luca whimper “dad” before he jumps into his arms in the biggest, sweetest embrace.
2. Top 10 Unforgettable Golden Buzzers on America’s Got Talent
Seeing people’s dreams come true will send chills through your body. Each season on America’s Got Talent, every judge and the host get one golden buzzer where they send the act straight to the live show. It’s the ultimate recognition of outstanding talent. Gold confetti falls, the crowd goes wild, and the act almost always falls to their knees in a puddle of tears and pure bliss. Golden buzzer acts range from child singers to a crazy acrobatic group that completes gravity defying tricks. Warning: This video is 50 minutes long, but you’ll find yourself sitting through the whole thing then clicking to watch the next inspiring AGT video that the site suggests.
3. Olympics Emotional Winnings
The Olympics: The pinnacle of an athlete’s career. Years and years of practice, training, sweat, sacrifice, blood, and tears. Everything’s on the line. Then, they nail the flip. They perfect the dive. They win the game. The crowd goes absolutely wild, and suddenly everyone, including you, is crying. As you watch the Olympians embrace their families and stand on the podium with tears literally pooling at their eyes, you will be crying in bed as you simultaneously finally etch in gym time in your schedule for tomorrow. Hey, no one is judging. That’s why Olympic videos are so good and emotional. They truly inspire.
4. Dogs Welcoming Soldiers Home
These are maybe some of the sweetest reunions because you truly feel how much these dogs love their owners when they go absolutely bonkers. The dogs attack the soldiers in a shower of kisses before tackling them to the ground in excitement. Cue the tears again when you watch the owners’ faces as they either have the widest smiles on their faces or break down in tears.
5. Sad Philippines Commercial Compilation
Not sure why Filipino directors are trying to get their TV viewers to cry all the time, but this country’s commercials really attack all the emotions all at once, violently. This compilation features six of the saddest commercials, and you’ll get stuck in a weird Asian commercial binge watch after this one. Start with Sad Philippines Commercial Compilation Part 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Considering the cover of Hozier’s new album “Wasteland, Baby!” features him resting, quite pensively, in an armchair underwater, it only makes sense that he would contrast this with the metaphorically — and literally — fiery, bold, and overall unsettling music video for his single “Dinner & Diatribes.” Released March 6 and directed by Anthony Byrne, this video does not shy away from the grotesque with a dinner party of bloody meat (and oddly enough, roasted marshmallows) as well as the body contortions and unnatural movement often found in a typical horror installment. With its dinner party straight from hell,“Dinner & Diatribes” stars one the new queens of horror, Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays the lead in both “The Witch” and “Split." Her presence alone is enough to set the uneasy, eerie vibe that haunts the entire video. Combining the rather upbeat, catchy tune with these creepy visual elements, Hozier has produced a video that is bound to leave fans energized, slightly mystified, and certainly anxious to Google search what exactly their beloved Irish singer was going for.
The song itself does not convey anything particularly gruesome: Hozier merely expresses his extreme attraction for a girl at a club and his frustration that he’s stuck having to converse at this party with her friends and do what is considered “polite” rather than have some quality alone time with his “honey.” Through the lyric “Hell is the talking type / I'd suffer Hell if you’d tell me what you’d do to me tonight,” the singer expresses his willingness to suffer through this small talk and these pleasantries that he clearly finds unbearable only because of the hope of some future satisfaction. Hozier sets the record straight himself when he tweeted, “Dinner and Diatribes is a playful number that tries to credit that feeling of relief when leaving any tedious social engagement” back on Feb. 15. Yet this playful lightheartedness seems to be replaced by something darker in the actual music video.
The video opens with shots of the dinner course of bloody skulls, slimy oysters, and fish heads accompanied by both the song title as well as the extra heading “A Seat at the Table.” The stuffy room of dark wood, candelabras, and dusty paintings where all the action will soon go down certainly fits with the lyrics’ message of meaningless social conventions and their unnecessary burden, an obvious representation of tired-out traditions and customs, yet the genuine romance that clearly shapes the song itself is nearly impossible to detect.
Almost unrecognizable with his iconic mane of hair slicked back, his beard shaved, and his teeth black and rotten, Hozier himself appears on screen, indulging himself with a burnt marshmallow on a stick and giving the audience a good view of the gooey treat between his black teeth. From his first creepy smile and sinister eyebrow-raise directed at Taylor-Joy’s character across the table, it becomes rapidly clear that Hozier is the menacing, antagonistic figure in this confrontation. Taylor-Joy begins flicking matches at this sleazy-looking man, hoping to inflict some sort of pain or possibly just to put an end to his relentless gaze, but all the matches burn out on impact.
Recognizing the futility of the matches, she attempts to walk away and presumably escape, but immediately, Hozier takes control of her body through some sort of mind control as indicated by his ever-intensifying gaze and her jerky, puppet-like movements. In one of the most ambitious shots of the video, the camera zooms in on Taylor-Joy face as she begins to flip upside down with the world blurring around her — which was achieved by strapping her into a contraption that would physically turn her 360 degrees around a camera. Quickly after, she is slammed back down into her seat by two waiters and forced to continue the confrontation. He continues to seduce her and draw her into his decadent lifestyle, causing her to crawl across the table top, but right before she reaches out her hand to caress his face, she aggressively resists once again. More of the dinner guests’ faces are revealed, all solemn, serious, and seemingly disinterested despite the drama and mental battle going on right before their eyes. A new waiter brings her another match, and this time, her flicking it at Hozier sets him into flames. As his body ignites — and yes, Hozier was actually set of fire for this shot — Taylor-Joy appears to gloat in her victory, amusedly roasting a marshmallow over this human campfire, when in a last-minute twist, one of the waiters sets her aflame too.
Considering the 2014 music video for Hozier’s “Take Me Church” relentlessly tackled the ugly issue of homophobia, it wouldn’t be out of character for this Irish artist to use “Dinner & Diatribes” as a mode of social commentary and a way to highlight social injustice. It isn’t particularly clear if the video is portraying the struggle of white feminists against a smarmy, arrogant patriarchy. Or possibly privileged versus marginalized groups of society more generally. Or even something else entirely. The initial subtitle of “A Seat at the Table” seems to indicate a struggle to gain a stake in society and possibly exert some new formed power — through this lens, Taylor-Joy could be seen as one of these disadvantaged groups of society battling against the condescending patriarchy, lingering racism, the one percent, or other privileged individuals (represented by Hozier), almost falling under the spell and mind control of this adversary trying to brainwash her. She wins her proper seat at the table by essentially murdering the obstacle in her way, but quickly the others turn against and point her out as a new target, indicating the very negative reciprocation of such a path towards power. Unlike with the song, however, Hozier provides no tweet to confirm the music video’s meaning and it is doubtful that he ever will. Regardless, this four-minute story depicts a girl seeking to destroy rather than reconcile with her enemy, and must face the dire consequences when this violent decision comes to harm her in the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a rough couple of years for social media stars. From the chilling documentary “The American Meme” to the Netflix film “Cam,” a deep-dive into the commodification of sex by camgirls, cultural gatekeepers have been looking into the social media abyss. From the examples above, at least, they don’t like what they see. "Clickbait" undoubtedly is an attempt to tap into this trend, centered around college students helplessly ensnared by the allure of the imaginary live-stream website “str33ker.com,” where content creators compete to be top dog on a constantly updated popularity chart. Things become complicated when butter-blonde Bailey (Amanda Colby Stewart), a top str33ker talent, becomes the obsession of a Trump-masked stalker. The situation goes downhill from there, culminating in a grisly stabbing — all, it seems, in the name of Internet fame.
It’s a familiar concept — in “Macbeth,” Shakespeare depicted in no uncertain terms the bloodthirst of the power-hungry — but a potentially fruitful one. There is a clear demand for compelling content that addresses our hesitations towards the growing prevalence of consumerism and surveillance capitalism in the modern world. It’s a pity, then, that "Clickbait” is about as counter-cultural as a Che Guevara t-shirt bought at H&M. Despite its experimental approach, "Clickbait" fails to create a convincing “world” for the viewer to rail against, thereby satirizing the very effort of social critique, rather than addressing societal issues themselves.
The issues for "Clickbait" center around a meandering script, which, despite reasonable efforts from the actors, fails to fulfill the “comedy” aspect of “comedy-horror.” In an attempt to capture the walkabout musings of youth, the dialogue is jarringly slow, in particular through lengthy conversations between the two protagonists Bailey and Emma (Brandi Aguilar), who, despite substantial screen time, remain one-dimensional throughout the film. Yes, the movie stands as a critique of the vapidity of internet fame and the pursuit thereof. Yet like its characters, "Clickbait" makes the fatal flaw of failing to seek deeper meaning, culminating in a work that is about as superficial as its subject matter.
Key to this lack of depth is inadequate character exposition: Bailey and Emma simply fail to convince as “college students” — they live in a spacious, well-lit apartment, wear store-bought costumes to Halloween parties, and appear to exclusively “study” from one oversized picture book on “plant taxonomy.” These flaws go beyond attempts at absurdist humor — the lack of a compelling scenario here jeopardizes the entire basis of the plot, specifically the nature of Bailey’s social media addiction itself. The viewer is left confused at the nature of Bailey’s content creation, and even her closest friend is dismissive of her str33ker pursuits. Ultimately the viewer is given no explanation or even portrayal of social media addiction in any form.
As a result, the stakes of this entire endeavor are comically low, to the detriment of the viewer, who struggles to maintain concentration through lengthy dream sequences where the deepest fears of the protagonists are cloyingly and extensively portrayed alongside a repetitive and one-dimensional synth soundtrack. Incidentally, the dated aesthetic of the soundtrack — an ostinato mishmash of muzak, preset synths, and ‘90s detective video games — does the long-winded cinematography no favors, both failing to build suspense for “horror” sequences, but also elongating the already sluggish pacing of the film in its monotonous constancy.
The consequence of this general lack of polish is that, despite the consumer appeal of the subject matter, the film’s value lies not in its message, but simply in how hard it tries to convey it. Instead of being engrossed in the escalating tension between Bailey and her masked stalker, the viewer becomes undeniably aware of the filmmakers themselves. "Clickbait" is overtly the work of artists in flux, feeling out pathways for communication, yet in that process, often reaching dead ends.
This is not to say the movie is without its moments of breakthrough. "Clickbait" comes closest to comedic clout with surrealist “ad breaks” placed throughout the film. These are much-needed breaths of fresh air and offer glimpses of a knowing wit from the directors which is otherwise lacking in the main plot. And, though in the context of the film, extended scenes of mundane dialogue are borderline arduous, there is something “Waiting for Godot”-esque about the daring of it all. Indeed, at points like the ad breaks, fragments of artistic imagination push through — but these moments are framed so laboriously it is easy to overlook their magic.
As seen in the popularity of social media documentaries, consumerism in its current manifestation is sufficiently egregious as such to adequately satirize itself. In artistic portrayals, then, the viewer seeks the more vulnerable, individual experience that so often is veiled by the capitalist structures which dominate our social lives. "Clickbait,” in its determination to provide biting social satire, becomes not a narrative on youth culture in tension with society, but one on the gut-wrenching strain of the directors to depict, and thereby illuminate a culture that they themselves do not seem to entirely understand. The result is an experience which, though perhaps not intentional, is praiseworthy in its viscerality alone. "Clickbait" is risk-taking, not at its best, but at its most authentic.

For Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April, the Women In Power Conference, Harvard Wears Denim, and Yoga for Restoration are just a few of the events the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response will lead. Bringing these efforts to the artistic realm, OSAPR and the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club will collaboratively present “Our Voices,” opening April 5. In its fourth iteration, “Our Voices” is a student-directed project with the goal of sharing stories of sexual assault and identity-based violence.
The show has taken place in April annually since 2016. As one of a number of initiatives related to sexual assault, the show offers a chance to deal with issues of violence through engagement of personal narrative. “It’s a way to work through what’s both personal and political,” Madeleine R. Snow ’20, one of the show’s two producers, said.
In order to facilitate that work, the performance creates a physical space for sharing and reflection. Co-director Rachel M. Kahn ’20 opted for an informal setup in Leverett Library Theater. Audience members will be able to walk around the the venue and look at visual art submissions, and performers will sit on the stage and assist with the stage management of each others’ performances, blurring the line between various production roles to make the space more comfortable for those involved.
“People can share and go through whatever spectrum of emotions they are processing and have it be contained in that room,” Kahn said. “They can express themselves and get anything out that they want to get out, and leave it. Hopefully that experience is in some way helpful or cathartic.”
Co-directors Kahn and Carla Troconis ’19 solicited submissions of original art relating to sexual assault and other forms of identity-based violence. In contrast to more traditional shows, rehearsals focus on what performers need to “make the performance and the space as useful and as comfortable for them as possible,” Kahn said.
Snow said the show offers to all members of the audience a chance to reflect and expand their worldviews.
“Even if you haven’t experienced sexual assault or identity-based violences, by listening to other people’s stories and seeing them in all sorts of artistic expressions, you can get a better understanding of someone else’s lived experience,” Snow said.
Since its conception in 2016, the show has changed to explore other issues that are related to sexual assault by broadening the form that submissions can take. “They can be things that address mental health issues and issues of identity-based violence,” stage manager Robert F. Malley ’20 said. “It has expanded the space and given more opportunities for more performers, more performances, more reflection by the audience, more opportunities for the directors to think about how all of these issues are interconnected.”
“Our Voices” will run April 5 and 6 at 7:30 p.m. in the Leverett Library Theater.

By now you’ve heard that Bazzi and Kiiara have agreed to visit the mud-slicked shores of Cambridge, Mass., for this year’s Yardfest. Harvard has made the questionable decision of scheduling the annual outdoor concert on a Sunday afternoon, leaving the two headliners to perform to a collectively hungover campus. As you attempt to wrench yourself from bed on Sunday morning, indulge in some Yardfest nostalgia. Throw on the sounds of the sometimes crowd-winning, sometimes disappointing, most definitely B-list artists who have graced Tercentenary Theater for Yardfests past.
Listen to the playlist here. 
2019 - Kiiara - “Gold” 
Odds are high that you’ve heard Kiiara’s “Gold” before and even higher that she’ll be singing the track this Sunday. Listen to it 50 times over in anticipation, so you feel at least slightly starstruck when it comes on.
2018 - Lil Yachty ft. Diplo - “Forever Young”
Wale and Lil Yachty, both rappers, broke the two-year streak of EDM artists at Yardfest. One of the best tracks performed was “Forever Young,” by Lil Yachty (sorry, Wale). For those unfamiliar with the headliners, this song surely rang a bell.
2017 - Tiësto, Oliver Heldens - “The Right Song” 
Tiesto lacked the cake-throwing charm of Steve Aoki, but he played a decent number of good remixes. His collab with Oliver Heldens and Natalie La Rose, “The Right Song,” will get you hype for Yardfest.
2016 - Steve Aoki - Pursuit of Happiness Remix
Only a Class of 2019 relic like me is old enough to remember this one. His remix of Kid Cudi’s “Pursuit of Happiness” brings back cake-tinged mosh pit memories for the senior class.
2015 - Jesse J - “Nobody’s Perfect”
Jesse J went onstage in a Harvard t-shirt for her set, spending the duration of her set congratulating the crowd for getting into the school. “Nobody’s Perfect” was one of the highlights of her set.
2014 - Janelle Monae - “Make Me Feel” 
Harvard was actually ahead of its time on this one. Monáe recently released her hit album “Dirty Computer” but was far less of a household name in 2014. “Make Me Feel” was one of the best tracks on the record, and it bumps.
2013 - Tyga - “Dip ft. Nicki Minaj”
Tyga was a controversial pick for Yardfest way back in 2013, and students signed a petition in an effort to have him removed. You might skip his more overtly misogynistic hit “Rack City” for recent collab with Nicki Minaj, “Dip.”
2012 - DEV - “Bass Down Low ft. The Cataracs”
The Cataracs, a now-inactive hip hop group, collaborated on DEV’s hit “Bass Down Low.” Pay your respects and give it a listen before Sunday afternoon.
2011 - Far East Movement - “Like a G6”
If you’re paying tribute to the Far East Movement’s 2011 Yardfest appearance, it isn’t up for debate what you’re listening to — “Like a G6.”
2010 - Wale - “Lotus Flower Bomb ft. Miguel”
Wale again! But make it vintage. He deserves a special place on your playlist, because he performed at Yardfest in both 2018 and 2010.

For an artist who claims to be the “hottest rapper out of New York,” Rich the Kid did not do himself any favors with his latest album, “The World Is Yours 2.” Released March 22, the 16-track ensemble consists of hard-hitting beats and vapid lyrics — a combination that pulls through when done right. Unfortunately, Kid’s newest album falls just short of the possibility. His first album, “The World is Yours,” premiered to mixed and positive reviews, with many citing Rich the Kid’s potential in upcoming albums. His sophomore album felt like more of the same. The songs are well-produced and braggadocious, but that is the extent of the album’s artistry. A chance for Rich the Kid to develop and add something new to the genre resulted in several powerful, slick beats and features that eclipsed the rapper’s presence on his own album.
“The World Is Yours 2” follows up on its predecessor with more assertions of fame, wealth, and power. Rich the Kid makes sure his listeners hear about his racks and Lambos in every single song. “They might say I’m trippin’, my bank account says different,” is just one of many iterations of the artist’s abundance of money. On other occasions, he graciously spends some of his lyrics on his prowess with women (“Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em / Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em”). At one point, one wonders if Rich the Kid does anything not pertaining to girls, money, and music. His lack of lyrical substance stands in stark contrast with the skills of most of the album’s features.
Big-name rappers and players of the hip-hop genre saturate “The World Is Yours 2” and enhance the album in ways Rich the Kid does not. Big Sean adds a verse in “Two Cups” and does not disappoint. His smooth, devil-may-care delivery of a story — even if it’s about his lack of heart — alongside an interpolated nod to Drake’s " God Plan" in the middle of his verse show off Big Sean’s prowess. The featured artist has a natural ability to give meaning and depth to what would otherwise be the common story of getting girls. In an entirely different way, rapper A Boogie wit da Hoodie outshines Rich the Kid with a verse in the track “Like Mike.” A Boogie wit da Hoodie raps about the very same things Kid does, but to greater effect. In his verse, he rhymes “gooey” with “Choo things,” dragging an “ooh” sound that he repeats to give the climax of his verse a charged ending. The expert use of internal and end rhyme in this particular verse, along with clear and lingering line delivery, makes it so clever and well done.
While Rich the Kid’s lyrics may disappoint, his beats definitely do not. One of the best parts about this album is the impressive production that lies behind many of his songs. Songs like “Splashin” and “Save That” feature a contrast between a deep bass drum and an airier and lighter woodwind instrument. The combination creates a gritty but mysterious ambience throughout the songs. This is prominent on the song “Woah," a mellow and melodic song that changes the pace of the album and adds a refreshing outlook on Kid’s lavish lifestyle. While Kid raps most of his lyrics, he also sings certain words or phrases, encouraging the soothing tone of the song. One of the more interesting songs in terms of sound is “Like Mike,” as dissonant note after note punctuate the beat of the song, emphasizing each line and particularly, each word landing on the beat. The underlying discordant sounds stick around long after the song ends.
While the production is great, it ultimately does not cover the shortfalls of Rich the Kid. He has the confidence, the money, and the lifestyle, but the prominence of featured artists highlight the problem: Kid does not have the uniqueness that others possess to stand alone and still be interesting. The better songs in his album are the ones with guests like Offset or NBA YoungBoy; alone, it is harder for Kid to add something new. While there are exceptions like “Splashin,” Rich the Kid primarily makes music good for energizing a party crowd. Until he breaks out of the box he’s in, he’ll only be a trap rapper with a beat that slaps — until it’s forgotten.

It can be difficult to be an adult and a Billie Eilish fan at the same time. Born into the entertainment industry in L.A. and propelled to fame at age 14 by the song “ocean eyes,” Eilish is easy to dismiss as just another production-line pop artist, masterminded by a shadowy and patriarchal chart-hit machine — it’s difficult to admit that the same person whose Instagram handle is @wherearetheavocados can also be the future of pop music.
This doesn’t even get to the core of why Eilish is so hard to accept. We live in a generation where Pepsi and Gillette are self-described propagators of social change and audiences increasingly question the rights of big corporations to invade social movements. Artistically, Billie Eilish takes the next step in this invasion. She leads the once aspirational icon of the popstar into the dark, where sponsored product placements are masked in shadow. When listening to “WHEN WE FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?”, there is a moment of delicious horror when we realize that Eilish is a consumerist Chatterton: openly a teenager, but draped in Louis Vuitton, clutching Beats headphones, and brushing against our skin while crooning about death.
All this makes it hard not to recoil. Yet Eilish is disquietingly convincing in her endless cycle of inner turmoil and death drive. The track “xanny” in particular elegantly pairs Eilish’s soft rasp with helicopter panning and bass distortion to thrilling effect. In “bury a friend,” interplay between Eilish’s vocals and a Depeche Mode-esque synth tritone known as the devil’s interval adds morbid credence to Eilish’s insistent refrain: “I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me."
In moments, pop clichés do seep through. In the uncharacteristically mellow ukulele ballad “8,” Eilish is in far more conservative territory: “I know you're not sorry/ Why should you be? / ‘Cause who am I to be in love / When your love never is for me?” While these moments come across as mild sonic clickbait, they are sufficiently enjoyable such that the listener can step back and think that, sure, she isn’t Kurt Cobain, but for this album that might just be a good thing. Instead of acknowledging a split between the expressive potential of the experimental and the broad-reaching platform of the consumerist, Eilish treads a fine line between them. The result is both instinctive and unfamiliar.
Eilish creates this effect of consumerist naturalism throughout the album by allowing the sounds of daily life to permeate her songs. One of the central ideas of the album is its focus on Eilish — not as an artist, but as a human being. From the opening declaration ("I have taken out my Invisalign, and this is the album!”), to the 2 a.m. iPhone memo rasp aesthetic, to the sampling of Michael Scott in “my strange addiction” (teens can’t get enough of The Office!), the album creates a reality for the listener to exist within, right at Billie’s side. Counterintuitively, it is this insistence in referencing the daily and the mundane that makes frazzled basslines and witchy club grooves truly pop. Just as Eilish herself slouches on the red carpet in baggy streetwear, “WHEN WE FALL ASLEEP” has a laissez-faire energy that makes its transitions from jazz-inflected yearning (“xanny,” “listen before i go”) to angst-ridden goth-pop (“bad guy”, “bury a friend”) effortless, dismantling the walls between the two in the process.
The album is perhaps limited in this sense. Broadly, tracks can be categorized into “songs to make you cry” and “songs to make you dance.” As those who anticipated this album by listening to the four pre-released singles know, the tracks individually, though enjoyable, lack a coherent message, aesthetically referencing several existing artists. As a composite, however, there is something radical about the work — a marriage of serious production chops (masterminded by her brother, the producer Finneas) and unabashed impetuousness, as seen on the worryingly titled “wish you were gay,” brings the album to life and cements Eilish as an artist who, beyond just wanting to make chart-toppers, has something to say, and the skills to say it.

Before Alison Klayman agreed to make a documentary about Steve Bannon, the former chairman of Breitbart News and President Donald Trump’s Chief Strategist, she had one caveat — she had to meet him first.
“I needed to meet him in person, partly to see if I really felt like I could spend the time with him,” Klayman said. “Is he gonna be someone worth watching? Will he be able to carry the film?”
As soon as she met him, that answer was an "easy yes.”
From their first conversation, Klayman was struck by Bannon's chattiness and "forceful charisma," but also by the cracks in his carefully-calculated messaging. "He has this vanity, and these blind spots where you’ll have him revealing himself in ways that he doesn’t intend," she said. “The opportunity to be embedded and really let his agenda reveal itself felt like an opportunity of historical importance — to ask some bigger questions about what the nature of evil is,” she added.
To Bannon, there's a "banality" to evil, as he told Klayman. She remembers one time when he spent several minutes illustrating that point with the example of the Holocaust, pointing to the Nazi leaders fetching Hitler his morning coffee. "There were people that actually sat and thought through this whole thing and totally detached themselves from the moral horror of it,” he told her, looking directly into the camera.
As a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, Klayman found a particular irony in Bannon's lecture on the Holocaust — particularly given that she believed his own ideology and leadership has helped fuel a resurgence of neo-Nazism.
“My grandparents are Holocaust survivors,” she said. And Bannon knew that, she added: "he thought he was being provocative." Bannon’s condemnation of the Holocaust bears heavy similarities to the condemnations that followed the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Va, which was organized by Neo-Nazis who credit Bannon as a figurehead. By co-opting the rhetoric of moral outrage against anti-Semitism, Bannon seems intent on delegitimizing the connection often drawn between Nazism and his brand of alt-right fearmongering.
But under Klayman’s direction, the connection is impossible to miss, as the film frames him in a visual and situational context that can highlight the dangers and hypocrisies in his worldview. “I thought that opening scene was an opportunity to examine the human reality behind people who do great harm and promote policies that hurt people and, I think, hurt our country,” Klayman said. “I knew right away that that was a great way to open [the film] and really tell people there’s a filmmaker behind this. I’m giving you a chance to meet Bannon with naked cuts so you really trust the filmmaking.”
Given the degree to which she disagrees with him, why, then, did Klayman choose to make the film? She said her involvement began when she was contacted about the project by producer Marie Therese Guirgis, a former employee of Bannon’s.
“Guirgis knew Bannon in one of his many previous lives — before the Tea Party, before his politics became sort of extreme.” Guirgis contacted him often after he joined the Trump campaign as CEO in 2016.
“She wrote him hate mail,” Klayman said. “He would write back politely, and she thought there was something bigger that could be done with this access, beyond the small gratification of telling him off personally.” That was the impetus for a “vérité” documentary.
“It’s not about sitting down with him for an interview,” she said. “My job was more to observe than to speak up most of the time.”
The film may seem to show Bannon in his natural element, but he had to agree to Klayman’s guiding hand. When starting out on the project, Bannon needed to sign a release giving her full creative control.
“There’s a way to responsibly put things in, especially where I knew that he was lying or distorting information,” Klayman said.
Klayman parsed Bannon’s rhetorical strategies and emphasized the characteristic persistence that has allowed him to take on many different roles. “He’s willing to use dog whistles as well as blatantly racist, bigoted language. It’s kind of a frightening skill, and it emboldens the people around him. It’s not so much that he’s a brilliant strategist, it’s just — that’s his way,” Klayman said. “The way he works the media, using his personal charisma, is also part of it. He’s carved out a place for himself, and when he loses it, he’s continually looking for new opportunities. He’s always trying to ride the wave, spend other people’s money, and get himself the credit.”
“I think he’s a figure who thrives at the brink. He’s been brought to the brink many times. He’s had many different careers. In the film, he experienced a lot of losses. But you get the sense that he doesn’t give up,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No movie villain is more terrifying than the chubby, pink stuffed bear Lots-O’-Huggin’ from “Toy Story 3.” His true horror lies in the disconnect between his fluffy, amiable exterior and his icy, malice-filled heart. He proves time and time again that he is more than willing to harm the other toys if it will help him get ahead, even leaving them to meet a fiery death in an incinerator, and never shows any signs of true remorse.
Beneath a similarly non-threatening façade, marked by Southern charm and songwriting prowess, Taylor Swift harbors a Lotso side of her own that emerges every once in a while in the form of a particularly caustic song. Those who have wronged her await a fate even worse than death by garbage fire: public humiliation and musical defamation. Her list of victims includes ex-boyfriends, the girlfriends of her love interests, and even one notable rapper. What follows is an attempt to choose from her extensive catalogue the five spiteful songs that hit the hardest.
5. “Mean”
I mean, it’s right there in the title. A song that superficially looks like an empowering anthem about refusing to let words hurt you also happens to include some pretty ruthless predictions about the futures of Swift’s critics. Allegedly written about music critic Bob Lefsetz after he publicly lambasted Swift’s performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards, the lyrics simultaneously preach self-confidence and also offer some pretty clear attacks on the character of Lefsetz and others. “All you are is mean, and a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean,” she sings near the track’s end. We get it — this person is mean. Perhaps it was unnecessary to also call him pathetic and “alone in life,” but apparently she really wanted to drive her point home. And does she really know that her critics have no other defining characteristics beyond their meanness? A slightly more open-minded look at their life stories could bring some clarity to this particular situation, but unfortunately Swift doesn’t take that approach. While her victims in this song (and Lefsetz in particular) must not be very nice people, Swift’s dismissal of their lives as doomed and lonely seems over-the-top. Maybe just stick to calling them mean several times in a row.
4. “Speak Now”
This song, like Taylor Swift herself, hides its malice under layers of lovesick melodies and wholesome fantasies, but nonetheless contains some scathing attacks. To summarize the song, Swift’s love interest is getting married to another woman, and she sets out to stop the wedding. This is all fine, until you consider about how the bride must feel when Taylor Swift pops up at her wedding and declares her love for the groom. To make matters worse, Swift can’t help but poke fun at the bride-to-be and her “snotty little family all dressed in pastel.” This could easily be construed an attack on the bride’s ten year old cousin or something, so it’s fair to say that Swift should cut back on the aggressive adjectives for the time being. Besides, unless she’s just a really big fan of “Wedding Crashers” or Rachel from “Friends,” Swift has no excuse to break up an impending marriage so callously, even if they did indeed say “speak now.”
3. “Better than Revenge”
Allegedly written about actress Camilla Belle as payback for her “theft” of Swift’s former boyfriend Joe Jonas, this particularly mean-spirited song asserts that Swift’s rival “underestimated just who she was stealing from.” Judging by her lyrical assassination here, that assertion seems true. On a side note, Joe Jonas can probably make his own informed decisions, so assuming that he was “stolen” seems a little bit inconsiderate of his agency. Honestly, he was probably tired of having hurtful jabs masked as country-pop songs directed at him. At any rate, the most aggressive lyric on this track comes when Swift calls Belle “an actress” who is “better known for the things that she does on the mattress.” Yikes. For the record, Camilla Belle was still upset seven years later, so you know this one cut deep.
2. “Picture to Burn”
This is one of Taylor Swift’s preeminent country bangers, perfect for listening to late at night driving down a country road, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that at its core it’s a petty, spiteful break-up song that’s mean in a childish (but probably still hurtful) way. She makes it tremendously clear that she “really really hates that stupid old pickup truck” her ex used to drive and calls him a “redneck” for good measure. This isn’t exactly a flattering portrayal of this guy, but it’s nothing compared to her threats she sends his way in the second verse. “There’s nothing stopping me from going out with all of your best friends,” she sings, and later adds, “If you come around saying sorry to me, my daddy’s gonna show you how sorry you’ll be.” Between the promises of destroyed friendships and physical violence, it might be a good thing for this dude if Swift burns all of her pictures of him. Who knows how else she might use them.
“Dear John”
“Dear John”
On the one hand, the criticisms that this song levies at John Mayer are probably deserved. On the other, calling him out by name in the song’s title and proceeding to completely annihilate his character over the course of an almost seven minute song seems harsh. The two dated when Swift was 19 and Mayer was 32, which is strange enough to begin with, but that fact only makes it even more surprising that the 19-year-old country singer emerged from the breakup with the upper hand. In her own words, she’s “shining like fireworks” over Mayer’s “sad empty town.” Without going into too much detail, every verse of the song just (pretty explicitly) alludes to Mayer’s manipulative ways and philandering. If you need further evidence of how mean this song is, look no further than Mayer’s reaction. He seemed genuinely hurt by the musical attack sent his way, saying, “I was really caught off-guard, and it really humiliated me at a time when I'd already been dressed down.” At the end of the day, Swift is never afraid to humiliate the people who wronged her in the most public of fashions, and Mayer stands as the most notable victim, but by no means the only one.

Political drama is one of the greatest genres of television ever created. At its best, it can wash away cynicism about American politics given the current political climate; it can be uplifting and motivational. A quality example is “The West Wing,”created by Aaron Sorkin, which focuses on the fictional Bartlet administration. It stands as the gold standard for what a political drama should do. The characters, such as C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney), Josh Lyman (Bradley Whitford), Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe), or Jed Bartlet (Martin Sheen) are well-known in the annals of television history. They fought the losing battle, stood up for the few, believed in the greater cause, and demonstrated the civic responsibility that everyone should strive for.
But unfortunately, political dramas are getting worse and worse. Too often, they devolve into romantic soap operas, in which the characters’ love lives are somehow more important than anything else.
It’s hard to live up to the the genius of Aaron Sorkin, but it seems these days no one cares about those kinds of characters and storylines. Audiences seem to want constant drama at the expense of good storytelling. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of five series-changing plot twists every episode, but that doesn’t matter if the viewer is distracted enough with scandalous affairs and attractive actors to ignore it.
With current or recent shows like “Scandal” or “Designated Survivor,” any content that would be worthy of attention is too often drowned out by that unending dramatic flare. Whether it’s steady shifting of alliances and character betrayal, or the constant uncomfortable sexual tension between virtually every character in the show, any meaningful or realistic plotline is buried under crowd-pleasing garbage. This, however, is in no way attacking talented producers like Shonda Rhimes. They know how to grab audiences and send them over an emotional cliff. This is, unfortunately, the reason why most television dramas of this sort aren’t very good anymore. Many people want that kind of nonstop drama. Many, but not all.
Yearning for a worthy successor to masterpieces like the “West Wing,” we loyal few will continue to flip channels and scroll through Netflix queues. In a time where politics is looked down upon as rules made by rules made by cynics, what could be more necessary than television that lifts civic ideals? Hopefully that day will come soon, because as Jed Bartlet said, “It’s not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It’s our job to raise it.”

In a book about family, trauma, freedom, and womanhood that spans several decades, Etaf Rum’s debut novel “A Woman Is No Man” aims to tell a story about women who are “born without a voice.” With four narrators in two parallel timelines, Rum seeks to capture a world in which Palestinian and American values war in Brooklyn and women are trapped by convention and each other. She nearly succeeds in this task, but the novel’s repetitive scenarios and persistent determinism leave the reader shy of satisfied.
“A Woman is No Man” jumps back and forth between two primary stories. The first follows Isra, starting in 1990 when she is a 17-year-old girl in Palestine who moves to the United States with her husband Adam after an arranged marriage. She struggles to adapt to a lonely new life and confronts the pressures of being a young wife and mother, seeking the love of her husband and her mother in law, Fareeda. The second begins in 2008, narrated by Deya, Isra’s oldest daughter, as her grandparents force her to meet marriage suitors when all she wants is to read and go to college.
Rum’s story reveals a perspective on the American immigrant experience that mainstream media rarely displays. Isra and Deya live in Brooklyn, but as Fareeda says, “It doesn’t matter where we live. Preserving our culture is what’s most important.” Both girls are forbidden from leaving the home alone or participating in American culture. Deya and her sisters go to an all-girls Muslim school in which most of their peers lead similar lives, in which the most important parts of a woman’s life are (arranged) marriage and providing sons to carry on her husband’s family name. Their community is driven by tradition and shaming. The novel disregards the concept of the American Dream: Isra dreams that life for a woman can be different in America but quickly comes to realize that even if this country can provide a nicer house and a consistent supply of food on the table, she is just as powerless and trapped in New York as her mother was in Palestine. The unique setting provides an interesting context for an in-depth exploration of the divide between cultures that is often explored in immigrant stories: While some characters like Fareeda and Adam work desperately to preserve their identity after the loss of their home by maintaining an Arab lifestyle, others like Deya struggle with being unable to belong easily in either world.
As the title may suggest, “A Woman is No Man” carries a dialogue on womanhood and its constraints at its core. Internal and external discussion of what is possible for a woman in this world, particularly a Muslim American woman, are everywhere, and they paint a grim picture. Isra and Deya are constantly reminded that “marriage is what’s most important for women” and domestic abuse is a fact of life as women are at the mercy of their husbands. Isra is shamed for having daughters that are considered burdens on her family, and female characters are perpetually shamed by others for being both too quiet or too loud, too lazy or too driven. The novel also shines a light on the frustrating reality of women pushing their daughters and granddaughters into the shame cycle out of a sense of helplessness. This may be a reality for many women, which Isra expresses with her desire to find stories of women like her in the books that become her solace, but hope for change is sparse.
These conversations and conflicts become old, however, as they take place over and over in both timelines. The vast majority of the novel shows characters reinforcing or accepting the state of their lives as a given. While the story structure generates a sense of momentum, only a few meaningful events or shifts in character development take place in the plot and each one is stretched out just a tad longer than feels necessary. Even the ending, which takes place in the earlier timeline, seems to be a step towards change for the role of women in this culture, but it is also colored by the knowledge that tragedy will follow shortly. Eventually, the constant reiteration of the role of women and the cycle of shame is exacerbating as a desperate hope to see one of the characters break out of the mold.
Rum handles the complex story structure and shifting point of view in the novel effectively with solid but inconspicuous prose. Its detailed setting and depiction of the effects of trauma, loss, and the refugee experience give it great potential to be an impactful debut novel. However, the plot is unsurprising with predictable twists and eventually becomes tiresome as change and character development come too little, too late. Thus, “A Woman is No Man” concludes with just a hint of disappointment at the story that it could have been.

“There are infinitely many kinds of beautiful lives,” writes Maria Popova in the introduction of her debut book, “Figuring.” The central question with which Popova is concerned is one that is far from original — generations of philosophers before and after have and will continue to ask: “What makes a beautiful life?” Yet the answer that Popova finds is neither repetitive nor tired.
“Figuring” hovers somewhere between the poetic and the literal, the fictional and the non-fictional, biography and autobiography, history and speculation. Through a mosaic of biography, told in a narrative style and punctuated with prose poetry, Popova’s “Figuring” is both scientific history and philosophical theory. The liminal nature of the book itself seems an apt reflection of Popova’s primary concern: The nonlinearity of lives and universes, which are comprised not of traceable trajectories and chronological happenings, but orbital acts of figuring. Of meaning-making through the lingering between, and at the intersections of, the orbits of various bodies — celestial bodies, perhaps, but more importantly, human ones. All are figured, in every moment, by incidental collisions between their own orbits and the oscillating bodies of others.
Popova explores this project of self-construction through the words of canonical transcendentalists such as Emerson and Thoreau, but synthesizes a final philosophy that is quite emergent and brilliant. Taking spliced histories of scientists, poets, and philosophers such as Emily Dickinson and Maria Mitchell, Popova’s “Figuring” is a spectacular and combinatory collision of multiple biographical landscapes, which, joined, tell a revolving, multifaceted history — and future. The result is a philosophy of “existential ecology,” a challenging of the idea of a static self and understanding that “throughout life, our habits, beliefs, and ideas evolve beyond recognition. Our physical and social environments change. Almost all of our cells are replaced. Yet we remain, to ourselves, ‘who’ ‘we’ ‘are.’”
Different from the self-grandiosity of Emerson and Thoreau’s absolute faith in the infinite potential and genius of the self is Popova’s quiet postulation that we, each and every one of us, are “BY GENIUS BELONGING TO THE WORLD. It strikes [her], this existential ecology, as the simplest, most perfect measure of an actualizes life.” Infinitudes may exist, but we, nevertheless are finite creatures. We may be genius, but we, and our genius, belong to the world. Transcendence is unnecessary and impossible — this earthly belonging, for Popova, is where the beauty in human existence originates. What makes our lives beautiful is the indelible yet constantly morphing web of connections (the ecology of the universe) that form the fractal geometries of the things we do, the people we love, and the world we study. The impulse of Popova’s thought is stunning in both its scope and execution — mosaic-like biographical stories of scientific and literary women figures combine to teach something fundamental about how to live our lives.
Devoid of the characteristic melancholia that often haunts existentialist works, Popova’s message is one of pure fascination and appreciation for the ephemeral and ecological natures of our lives. Rarely is a book of philosophy a page-turner, but Popova’s “Figuring” is a noted departure from the dry words of old white men that comprise the “Philosophy” section of a bookstore or a library. Hers is an enlightening theory of existential ecology — it is a shiningly femme, revolutionary, and poetic piece of literature.
As “Figuring” ends, “The atoms that huddled for a cosmic blink around the shadow of a self will return to the seas that made us. / What will survive of us are shoreless seeds and stardust.”

In Renee Nault’s graphic rendition of “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood, graceful watercolor forms glide across soft panels. A Canadian artist, illustrator, and graphic novelist, Nault describes herself as a “visual sponge, indelibly influenced by the pictorial landscapes that surround her.” The resulting artistic synthesis of her daily visual encounters, from the patterns and style of Japanese Ukiyo-e prints to the latest movie she watched, is an eerie, vivid, and weightless style. Her work has appeared internationally in various publications and her latest completed project is a graphic novel adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.”
The Harvard Crimson: How has your career unfolded and how did you first develop an interest in graphic art and design?
Renee Nault: I went to school for illustration at Sheridan College and that was a 3-year program and a foundation year as well, and after I graduated, I started doing mostly editorial and fashion illustration — a lot of magazines and newspapers. And at some point I decided I wanted to try a comic so I started making my own comic, and started making a comic called “Witchling,” which is a watercolor horror fantasy that I have going on, and through that and some other projects, the publishing company in Canada — Margaret’s publishing company — got a hold of me to do [“The Handmaid’s Tale” graphic novel].
THC: What tools do you find yourself using the most and do you tend to prefer digital or traditional mediums?
RN: I always work traditionally — I just really like the feeling of it. Even though digital is a lot faster, working traditionally you make a lot of little mistakes that give the work its personality. So, in terms of tools, I usually just use regular watercolors and ink — I don’t deviate too much from that.
There are little logistical things with working traditionally — like you can’t go back and change something later. It’s not a practical way to work but I really think it gives the work more possibility. And it’s just more fun to make it.
THC: How do you feel that the medium, such as traditional watercolor and ink on paper, has shaped your style, especially in regards to the creation of a comic book, which usually relies upon digital mediums?
RN: You have to embrace a really organic style. You’re never going to get the perfectly straight digital lines or the perfect gradient of shading. So you have to kind of forget about all of that and focus on something that looks handmade and really lean into that. Because if you try to fight against that handmade (oh, that’s a pun!) style, it just doesn’t work. For my style, I don’t care if the panel borders are kind of wobbly or my gradient gets some blobs or some little water stains in it. I like that look.
THC: What do you consider when thinking about how to translate a written literary work into a visual representation? How do you choose how to construct your graphic novel panels?
RN: When I read a book, I have really strong visual pictures in my head, which a lot of people do. So I had an idea, even before I started [working on] the book, of what I thought everything should look like in terms of the feeling of it, the color palette, and the costumes. From that, I kind of just kept refining the designs and of course, running everything by Margaret Atwood. It was hard to make choices because there was so much in the book that I had to leave out of the graphic novel just because of space. So what I hoped was that it would pare the novel down to its most important themes and capture the essence that way, rather than literally translate each page of the novel.
THC: Do you think that there is something that the graphic novel provides that the original work, as a piece of literature, might not be able to?
RN: One interesting thing about graphic novels is they can easily shift between the literal and the abstract. So the character has lots of inner monologues where she goes off on these little splices, and in the graphic novel, you can show that visually at the exact same time as you’re showing what’s actually happening. It’s the kind of things you definitely can’t do in other mediums because it would be just too confusing. And contradicting what the narrative is saying and what you’re seeing is something that graphic novels do really well.
THC: What was the collaboration process like with Margaret Atwood and how did you make sure that the graphic novel would stay true to her vision as well as your artistic vision?
RN: She’s really, really busy so she didn’t have that much time to look over my shoulder at everything I was doing, so she had a lot of trust in my ideas. Basically the publisher sent me the novel and said, “Hey, make a script out of this and then make it into a graphic novel.” So I took the novel, basically started highlighting all the things I thought were the most important, paring it down to as little as I could do and made sort of a movie-style script based off that. That went to the publisher, and Margaret and everyone looked through it and approved it. From there on, Margaret really only had to approve the most important things, like the designs of the characters and costumes or the direction we were going to go with the epilogue, so she was pretty hands-off all together.
THC: Have you found there to be a large difference between creating original art and an adaptation for an existing piece of literature?
RN: Absolutely, yeah. The thing with “Witchling” and other comics like that is that it can be anything I want. I’m not answering to anybody. If I decide I don’t want to draw this building, I don’t have to draw it. I can work around it. But of course working on someone else’s story, it’s very much set in stone. You’re definitely on a path if you’re working on somebody else’s work, whereas if you’re doing your own thing, you can go off in any direction your imagination takes you.
THC: Are you currently working on anything else?
RN: I am working on an anthology of short comics, trying out different styles. I also think I’m going to do a gallery show somewhere in the near future. And hopefully I’ll actually get to finish “Witchling,” because “Witchling” had a lot of fans that were really left hanging when I started “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

a single line births infinities of commands
There’s something distinctly voyeuristic about watching the ocean move, the waves lap at the shore in a show of intimacy beyond what I am capable. There is no melancholia, no pain, no hesitance, no lingering in the phasing of the moon. Only utter, irrevocable certainty of the same sort as a funeral, the type that lifts a veil to drop a blade and passes in cycles, like the function of a rotational movement or some other intractable law of the physical universe. Somewhere there is an eclipse and simultaneous waning, which happens at once all at once and not unlike menstruation in its motion which is all sudden convulsions and gradual aches. Yesterday you said the sea was like a phantom and look, there is the pacific.

The 2019 Battle for Yardfest — an annual music competition that determines the student performers for Harvard’s spring music festival — culminated with a Wheel-of-Fortune style reveal of the concert’s headliners. After two hours of live music in Sanders Theatre, Harvard’s College Events Board took to the stage, revealing letters on posters one by one. The audience shouted guesses (“Drake?”) from the balcony.
When CEB announced the final names — Bazzi and Kiiara — the audience burst into applause.
Yardfest, the College’s spring music festival, will take place on April 7 in Tercentenary Theater. The event will feature two professional artists, Bazzi and Kiiara, and two student groups. There will also be a dinner in the Yard and neighborhood block parties across campus.
This year’s headliners, Bazzi and Kiiara, are both pop artists with Midwestern origins. Michigan-born Bazzi is best known for his singles “Mine” and “Beautiful,” and his first album debuted in 208. Kiiara, who is from Illinois, gained fame through her 2015 debut single, “Gold.” She is also known for her collaboration with Linkin Park, “Heavy.”
Before the event, several audience members said that they’d like to see Ariana Grande or Khalid headline Yardfest. One viewer said that she wanted to see One Direction make a Yardfest comeback — she had dreamed about the band the night before, she said, “and you can put that on the record.”
Bazzi’s and Kiiara’s names did not come up in the pre-Battle poll. After the announcement was made, however, audience member Casey R. Goggin ’19 said that while he doesn’t “really know” the artists, he is excited to see them at Yardfest.
Two student acts, Extra Extra and Maybe There’s Life, will open for Bazzi and Kiiara. The groups won their spots in a competition between nine different bands, judged by both audience votes and an expert panel.
Extra Extra is a four-person band whose sound is comparable to, per the group’s Facebook description, “Smash Mouth meets Zeppelin meets Weezer (but only Weezer’s recent albums).” The group opened with an original song, “Dreaming,” and closed with audience members singing along to the Killers’ “Mr. Brightside.”
The other winning student act, Maybe There’s Life, is a collective and record label from Michael A. Aduboffour ’21 (MJangles) and Lincoln A. Hart ’21. Hart rapped while wearing a tweed blazer; MJangles sang in a maroon suit jacket, running across the stage with the bottom of his jacket bouncing. Both Hart and MJangles plan to become professional musicians.
In addition to the winning performances, the Battle for Yardfest offered viewers acts from pop to rock to breakdancing. 21 Colorful Crimson, one of last year’s winners, performed a song dedicated to mothers. Beatboxing and R&B group the SH*T staged their performance as a mock relationship counseling session. Six-person rock band Edna Mode took their shirts off; when Daniel K. Hasegawa ’22 brought out his harmonica for a Bob Dylan number, audience members began waving the flashlights on their phones. Emcee and British comedian Chris James broke up the music with jokes about Harvard (he asked if anyone had sports pictures to photoshop him into), England, and dating.
“I thought it was great,” Goggin said of the night. “Luke Martinez is a real live popstar. I love the people who had real, original music — loved [the band] Eat Your Feelings.”
After the show, lead Extra Extra singer Ethan J. Fields ’22 said that he hopes Yardfest will “build on the momentum” that he felt at the Battle.
“It’s just great to see people coming out and enjoying live music,” Fields said. “We’re just feeding off that energy.”

Name any holiday, and you’ll likely find the perfect pie for it. From crisp apple pies signaling New England fall to pumpkin pies unfurled on the Thanksgiving dinner table, separating specific pies from their traditions quickly turns into an impossible task.
In their cookbook debut, “The New Pie,” expert pie bakers Chris Taylor and Paul Arguin challenge this interpretation. They both agree that pie, despite its enduring qualities, should not “be confined to what pie has always been.” With over 15 years of combined competition experience and mountains of accolades to boot, Taylor and Arguin offer a convincing glimpse into why innovative pies transcend traditional pies.
Taylor and Arguin aren’t your casual pie bakers turned cookbook writers. Since their first pie contest in 2011, they have won over 500 baking rewards. Now a married couple, they recently won the 2017 National Pie Championships with their Checkerboard Peanut Butter Pie. Their mutual love for each other and pie become evident throughout “The New Pie” with their shared stories of recipe inspiration. In the blurb for the Nicolé pie, the authors fondly recount their delicious meals and cocktails at Nicolé, “a small Italian restaurant tucked away on a side street in St. Thomas.” Learning about their explorations make their cookbook a heartwarming read, one that leaves you eager to jump into the next pie competition with them.
Unlike cookbooks that churn out a high quantity of recipes, Taylor and Arguin’s smaller list of 75 pies allows them to incorporate stunning photographs with every page flip. Ripe colors and rich textures capture the delicate pie making ritual from kneading the dough to cutting the first slice. Along with the detailed instructions and personal anecdotes, the photographs provide the baker with an aesthetic goal to strive for.
Even with the authors’ established pie-making profundity, they realize that not all pie recipes, and pie cookbooks, are created equal. By incorporating difficulty scales for ingredients, equipment, and construction into each recipe, the cookbook appeals to all pie makers and bakers. They hook bakers with easy-to-make recipes, such as German Chocolate Pecan and Tahitian Pineapple. Recipes such as the Double Bubble, on caliber with winners produced at the National Pie Baking Competition, offer bakers aesthetically pleasing challenges. But while the cookbook does not shy away from tough techniques, the recipes with three-star difficulty ratings are accompanied by reassuring advice for the first time baker: that the pies are “entirely doable if you follow the instructions.”
And yet, while the authors do their best to make each recipe accessible, recipes do not indicate how long each pie takes to make. While pie makers should expect lengthy preparation, baking, and assembling times, accurately gauging the length of each process would certainly help any kitchen scenario. Baking pies is laborious, but “The New Pie” succeeds as a cookbook for both new and experienced pie bakers seeking a culinary challenge.
Some recipes, such as the Chocolate Hazelnut Pie, include ingredients that were challenging to find, despite the difficulty level being only a two out of three. The ingredients for these recipes range from common finds, such as bittersweet chocolate chips, to the peculiar malted milk powder. But locating the malted milk powder in your local grocery store may present a challenge. If the recipe shows two or more stars for equipment, be prepared for a grocery scavenger hunt. And yet even with the few substitutions, the Chocolate Hazelnut Pie turned out moist, dense, and most importantly, delicious.
“The New Pie” deserves a place on your kitchen’s shelf. It is the ultimate guide to crafting the perfect nontraditional pie for your next dinner party, friendly date, or holiday meal. By exposing more people to the creative potential in traditional pie recipes, new pies will give our traditional holidays a much needed modern twist.

I am not even supposed to be here.
Every single day that I have spent on Harvard’s campus I have believed these words.
I was born in Chicago, Ill., but my family is from the Dominican Republic. Growing up at a disadvantage as a minority, and attending a low income and underachieving high school, Morton West, surely would make it more difficult to attend such a prestigious university.
So what allowed for my journey to be different than the expectations already set within the community I grew up in? After all, it was the norm to dropout of high school or simply attend a community college.
My family foundation had a great deal with my opportunity to attend Harvard, but one thing that aided me above all was the game of basketball.
I remember as a child I played basketball for leisure simply because it was most accessible. My father made it a priority to live right across the street from the local YMCA to ensure that my two older brothers and I would stay out of the streets by going to the gym every day after school.
Despite living so close to the YMCA, my parents would not let us go until we finished our homework, thus instilling the value of academics at such a young age. Eventually, my growth in basketball became noticeable that I attracted the attention of a few classmates who played on a travel team. My parents allowed me to join the team as they found it as another way to stay active and away from the wrong crowd.
Quickly I began to fall for the feeling of the game, with the fast pace and energy that it entailed. By the time I reached 8th grade, there was a significant growth in my athleticism that begun to separate me from my teammates. In fact, I remember getting my first in-game dunk as an eighth grader and it made me realize that I wanted to play this game at the next level.
After this occurred, I remember praying to God and asking for the chance to play at least NCAA Division III basketball with the goal of having my parents not pay for college. Little did I know what the path ahead would lead to. 
As I prepared for high school, my focus in life became solely focused on academics and basketball. In fact, I applied for and received the prestigious Daniel Murphy Scholarship, which gave me the opportunity to attend any private high school of my choosing with tuition paid for. The opportunity of a lifetime was given to me.
I let the scholarship go.
Instead, I chose to stay at the local public high school that my two older brothers were already attending, Morton West. The backlash from not accepting this prestigious scholarship was never-ending. I trusted my family, and more importantly, I wanted to challenge the status quo and prove that you can make it out of Morton West to a higher institution.
My belief that the school did not define the student, but the student that defines what they make out of the school, stuck with me. In my second year in high school, I received my first scholarship offer to play basketball, from Hampton University. The following year I began to receive more attention, specifically from many high-achieving academic institutions. Eventually, I received a scholarship offer from every Ivy League school.
But when Harvard offered, the feeling was just different.
The first time I visited Harvard with my family I knew this would be the place I would attend. Furthermore, attending Harvard was a bigger decision than myself. This decision would impact my community above all, as kids would now believe that one can make it out of Berwyn and achieve something great. In fact, I knew the magnitude of this decision as I began to receive scrutiny from people.
The day after I committed to Harvard, I woke up with graffitti over my garage. Although this bothered me, I would not let this deter me from my decision to attend Harvard.
Not only was it the best institution in the world, but the basketball program with Coach Amaker at the helm was changing the perception of Ivy League Basketball. With multiple Ivy League Championships and NCAA tournament berths, I wanted to be a part of Amaker’s legacy here at Harvard.
Now, fast forwarding to my senior year at Harvard, becoming a part of his legacy and creating my own is something that I can now cross off the list.
Being a part of the Harvard Men’s Basketball program has been the honor of my life. Not only did I get to play basketball representing the best institution in the world, but I also got to experience memories that will last a lifetime. From traveling to Shanghai to play Stanford, participating in the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii, touring Twitter HQ, meeting President Jimmy Carter, and others, playing for Harvard has taught me more about life than anything.
One of the most important lessons I’ve learned is that anyone can be a part of a team, but being a part of a family takes much more. As Coach Amaker always tells us, “Don’t mistake routine for commitment.” 
Being a part of a family takes commitment and as I now reflect on my time at Harvard, I am lucky to have a family in Harvard Basketball. Furthermore, being able to lead and captain this group of men has been a privilege in my final year.
As our season has now come to an end, I have now made preparations to step away from the game of basketball. My entire childhood has consisted of this game and sure it will be strange to not play basketball anymore, but I am not ashamed of how the journey turned out. I had the honor of putting a city on my back and showing them that it is possible to attend a place like Harvard, even while being at such a disadvantage.
I found a family at Harvard and made memories that will last a lifetime. While yes, I have believed I am not supposed to be here, here I am.
Living my dream and trying to inspire others to do the same.
— Weisner Perez ‘19 is a Sociology concentrator in Quincy House, and served as co-captain for Harvard Men’s Basketball in 2018-2019. Following graduation, he will join UBS in New York City, working in the Wealth Management Division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Harvard will hold an all-day event entitled “Harvard Hears You: The 2019 Summit for Gender Equity.” This event will feature several panel discussions and talks by speakers including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. Hopefully, this summit will inspire productive conversations. However, despite the administration’s claim that it “hears us,” Harvard has consistently ignored student workers’ calls for substantive policy changes that would promote gender equity on campus.
We don’t need empty rhetoric from Harvard’s top administrators; we need a strong union contract. Our union, Harvard Graduate Students Union—United Automobile Workers, is calling for strong contractual protections against discrimination and harassment on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, immigration status, disability, and other identity characteristics. Specifically, student workers are calling for such protections to include a fair and neutral grievance procedure. In negotiations, the administration has consistently refused to agree to these protections, even after hundreds of students and workers across campus rallied for our civil rights.
The University insists that its current internal procedures for addressing discrimination and harassment are sufficient; and yet, these procedures enabled high-profile professors such as Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez to allegedly abuse at least eighteen women with impunity. Undergraduate and graduate students in the Government department have called on the University to conduct an external review of the Dominguez case. However, just last week, Bacow announced that Harvard would not conduct such an external review until the end of its internal review — a seemingly indefinite process. If Harvard is serious about promoting gender equity, it should agree to a union contract that includes strong discrimination and harassment protections.
Student workers are also calling for wage and salary transparency for all open research and teaching jobs on campus. Such transparency is essential for promoting gender and racial pay equity. However, in negotiations, the administration has not yet agreed to such transparency. To work towards genuine gender equity, the administration should sign a union contract that includes pay transparency for all open positions.
Our union is also calling for guaranteed, paid parental and family leave; subsidies for student workers with children; and affordable dependent healthcare. In the United States, our lack of parental leave and affordable childcare is a major contributor to gender inequality, as women disproportionately drop out of the workforce to take care of their children. Guaranteeing parental leave, childcare support, and dependent healthcare for parents of all genders would provide crucial support to student parents and help ensure that nobody would need to choose between pursuing a graduate degree and having a family. However, Harvard has not yet responded to our proposals on these issues. In order to advance gender equity, Harvard should agree to a union contract that guarantees paid parental and family leave and provides adequate financial support for student workers with children.
Additionally, student workers are calling for a comprehensive, affordable healthcare package that includes coverage of reproductive services as well as transgender healthcare and gender-affirming support. However, the administration has failed to respond to our healthcare proposal. Harvard should foster intersectional gender equity by signing a union contract that ensures that student workers of all genders and gender identities can access the healthcare that we need.
Across campus — and at the negotiating table — student workers are telling Harvard what it should do to promote gender equality. Yet instead of adopting these reforms, the University is ignoring us. Showy summits might create good publicity for the University, and they may even generate useful discussions, but without concrete steps from the administration and without a timeline to enforce accountability, these events will not make Harvard a more equitable institution. In order to build a truly equitable campus, Harvard must sign a union contract that includes contractual protections against discrimination and harassment; pay transparency; paid parental leave; financial support for student parents including childcare support; and comprehensive healthcare for all student workers and their dependents. The time has come for the administration to take real action on gender equity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent years have brought with them a growing movement to critically examine Harvard’s history and legacy as it stands at odds with the University’s views on diversity, inclusivity, and multiculturalism today. One of the latest stories in this saga has been the announcement by incoming Lowell House Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser that portraits of former University President A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and his wife Anna Parker Lowell will not hang in the House’s dining hall upon reopening this fall after renovations.
We support Laibson and Zipser’s decision. Lowell’s contributions to and legacy on Harvard’s history have been fraught and complicated. His tenure as president — spanning from 1909 to 1933 — brought with it many institutional changes, most positively the creation of the House system.
Lowell’s legacy, however, has been deeply overshadowed by and cannot be disentangled from from his racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, and xenophobia. His presidency was marked by events such as failed attempts to institute quotas of Jewish students, as well as the segregation of black students, banning them from living in Harvard Yard, and the “Secret Court of 1920,” which was connected to the suicide of a gay undergraduate.
Significantly, Laibson and Zipser have also declared their intent to host several House-wide conversations on the significance of Lowell’s legacy. History, they correctly note, should not be forgotten or erased in an email to House affiliates. We hope these discussions will spark a nuanced discussion on the former president’s actions and what those actions not only represented in his day but also in our present one, as we recognize it is important to consider individuals within the context of the time period in which they lived. Removing the portrait is not erasure, as long as doing so is accompanied by conversations that allow students to do the hard work of complicating, contextualizing, and making sense of Lowell’s legacy and impact — something which this campus has yet to seriously do.
We would be remiss if we did not note that the University has taken positive steps to address the legacy of many of its more positive figures, who are often overlooked. For example, three years ago the University displayed the portrait of Richard T. Greener, who in 1870 became Harvard’s first black graduate, in Annenberg Hall. This new portrait demonstrates how in thoughtfully representing its history, the University must not only think about removing monuments to figures who may not cohere with its evolving values but also erect new ones to those who we can take pride and who may expand our sense of what it means to be a member of this community.
With the reopening of the renovated Lowell House this August, we believe it is the perfect time for the House to reaffirm its own values, while potentially establishing new ones. History is imperfect, but it is only through constant discussion, questioning, and informed debate that we can properly understand what its legacy means to us today — for we are the ones who bear its lasting marks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend I had the extreme misfortune of being in New Haven, and the shock of the experience, no matter how often I visit, is never diminished. Indeed the freshness of it, the absence of any inoculation, made me rehearse in my mind my various previous trips, and a Yalie’s offhand mention of Grace Hopper College brought me to February 2017.
That was when, one Saturday afternoon as I was hastening to Union Station to escape back to Cambridge, Yale announced that this name would serve thereafter in place of Calhoun College, which had lately been causing protests on account of the eponym’s vigorous defense of slavery.
This in turn reminded me of the recent announcement that portraits of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, will not hang in the dining hall when the relevant House reopens in the fall. Which then made me reflect on the other legacy problem — i.e., the legacies of persons whom we honor in public places, which might one day cause us to stop so honoring them.
A friend of mine pointed out to me, as I was ruminating aloud — my mother used to yell at me for doing that at the dinner table — that regardless of whether I liked the renaming, the renamers were acting in logical consistency with their Weltanschauung. I was about to concede the point when I thought that in fact, while they are being consistent, they are also being awfully slow, which ought to be from their point of view extremely incriminating.
I shall explain what I mean. Calhoun was probably a high priority for the renamers, since his enthusiasm about the “peculiar institution” renders him uniquely ineligible for the excuse that he was merely a man of his times, going along with the current. Than Lowell, however, I can think of many people more loathsome, or at least just as loathsome, which would make silence about their eponymous buildings a culpable offense.
Former Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough, Class of 1898, for example, Lowell’s man Friday during the purge of gay students in the 1920s, has been allowed to keep his dorm, although that may be because few people have ever seen it. A bit of a movement is beginning to accumulate around former University President Increase Mather, slave-owner and witch-hunter; perhaps he will be the next major target of neonomania.
But all this is really child’s play compared to the enormous wealth of grievances that accost the eye, no matter which way one turns. That the renamers even have time to attend class is a testament to their ignorance of how offensive their surroundings actually are. (Consider, as your Irony of the Day, the proposition that they would be better able to identify and remove glorifications of old, dead patriarcho-fascists if they consented to read about them.) Harvard is profiting off photos of slaves? Pish-tosh. Where is the attempt to remove leering portraits and references to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Class of 1861, the ardent eugenicist? Surely three generations of imbecilic protestors are enough. Why do we tolerate the preservation of the Adams House quarters of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, the zealous jailor of Japanese-Americans?
It would require a degree of subtlety absent in our renamer friends to respond that these men’s legacies are mixed; that Holmes defended socialists’ freedom of speech; that Roosevelt saved the struggling and abused poor with his social programs; that in their failures they were but men of their time, and visionaries in their successes.
But, as I say, the renamers are not subtle enough to think this. They merely demand unconditional surrender, and it remains a mystery how they alight on their targets in the first place. They have not yet demanded that Lowell House be renamed, but they were successful in turning “House Master” sufficiently into a Rorschach test to cause the College to continue the nuclear proliferation of the title “dean.”
Or, to take a more Straussian reading, perhaps the renamers are being deliberately selective in their targets because they know most of the substitute honorees they select will become offensively obsolete in a few decades. The Kennedy School, for example, is a monument to a man whose presidency was one long episode of #MeToo, but nonetheless he remains as violator and martyr in the liturgical books of the Left.
Indeed one of the benefits of the dearth of biographical information about John Harvard is the resultant ignorance of any of his intolerable intolerances (which is not true, for instance, of Mr. Eli Yale). It seems safe to assume, however, that, having lived in the 1630s, he was at least a racist, a fundamentalist, and a gynophobe, pending the discovery of more damning material. Nor can we any longer justify the exclusionary habit of naming things after only Harvard affiliates, a group not at all representative of the world population. I propose, therefore, that Harvard — which as a name will soon be, if it isn’t already, insupportable — hereafter be called Maya Angelou University.
When Yale is correspondingly renamed Gore Vidal College, I do not foresee any drop in ticket sales for The Game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the search for a new dean at the Graduate School of Design progresses, students have re-published a letter identical to one issued during the school’s last dean search in an effort to argue that the same concerns from 12 years ago still exist today.
The letter, identical to that published during the School of Design’s 2007 dean search, was different only in that it was addressed this time to University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 rather than former Provost Steven E. Hyman. Over the course of the search Garber has met with students during two separate town hall discussions, each drawing dozens of participants.
Jessica A. Lim, vice president of student group Open Letters, said students raised a number of concerns in these meetings, including many already detailed in the open letter her organization re-published Feb. 5. The group crossed out and replaced the dean's name and the date in the 2007 letter, which was written by then-student forum president Ryan G. Bollom.
The letter lists students’ main priorities in the selection of a new dean, including finding someone who will support “interdisciplinary collaboration,” expand spaces for School of Design student use on campus, increase financial resources at the school, and find faculty from a diverse array of backgrounds committed to robust pedagogy.
“At present, total lack of communication cripples any effective, coordinated school-wide initiative,” Bollom wrote in 2007. “We maintain that this territory of ‘school-wide’ is the domain in which the dean must operate.”
The letter’s re-publication coincided with Garber’s second town hall Feb. 7. Lim presented Garber with a copy of the letter at that meeting and reiterated many of its points in person.
“It was important for us to put that letter out there because it was just interesting to us that a lot of the same issues are recurring and yet we’re 12 years down the road,” Lim said. “The fact that these issues haven’t been addressed successfully is something worthy of comment.”
Graduate School of Design spokesperson Travis Dagenais declined to comment on the dean search and student concerns.
The letter comes as the school continues to grapple with the release last spring of a “Shitty Architecture Men” spreadsheet alleging sexual assaults and racist acts by 18 School of Design affiliates. Dean Mohsen Mostafavi was among those accused in the spreadsheet. The school, facing student protests and a statement of support signed by 35 female faculty members, took steps to promote diversity and address misconduct in October, including creating a diversity deanship and requiring Title IX training for faculty.
Mostafavi announced his departure from the position in October. He will end his 11-year tenure at the end of the academic year as the school prepares for an expansion of its main building, Gund Hall.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Garber sent an email to students in early November asking them to share their input on the dean search and announcing the members of a faculty advisory committee. Garber also held the first town hall that month.
“Your observations and advice will help us not only identify promising potential candidates but also develop a rounded and textured view of the GSD and its possibilities for the future,” they wrote.
Bacow and Garber have received more than 100 emails through an address provided in the email, according to University spokesperson Jonathan Swain.
Zarina Ateig, a School of Design student who attended both meetings with Garber, said she felt the provost listened and was responsive to students’ concerns.
“I’m seeing a lot of traction between administration and the students, and I know for a fact that the things that we spoke about at the first meeting, for example, were addressed by our second meeting, or at least were acknowledged,” Ateig said. “It did not fall on deaf ears for sure.”
Lim said she thought it was unclear whether Bacow, Garber, and the 12-member dean search committee had fully considered student input because of the ambiguity of the process.
“This whole process has been very opaque,” she said. “It’s Harvard’s policy to not give up any of that information so we don’t know whether it’s had an impact or not.”
As with all recent dean searches across the University, Harvard has not released a list of any candidates being considered for the role.
Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the dean search was continuing to make good progress and said Bacow and Garber have worked to hear student voices.
“The President and Provost have taken multiple steps to receive input and considerations that inform the search, including from students,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student and Latinx Student Association finance officer Aaron Benavidez alleged GSAS’s Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs has not given LSA sufficient financial support in an email to more than 100 students and administrators Friday.
In the email, Benavidez wrote that ODMA has refused to fund LSA multiple times, though the office has allocated grants of $11,000 to groups including LGBTQ@GSAS, Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, and the W.E.B. Du Bois Society — an organziation for underrepresented minorities at GSAS.
Arguing that administrators should give affinity group leaders increased support, Benavidez cited the Dudley Fellows program which funds Fellows — who organize programming in Lehman Hall — with $3,500 stipends. He echoed long-standing arguments made by graduate students that student group leaders who organize diversity-related programming should be funded in a similar manner.
LBGTQ@GSAS member Madeleine F. Jennewein, who was copied on the email, wrote in an email to The Crimson that she believes ODMA has not followed through on promised financial support for student leaders of affinity groups. She also wrote the lack of diversity fellows at Dudley House has negatively impacted student leaders’ ability to host programming.
“While funding is a difficult process for any student group, the fact that minority support groups are providing essential services that Harvard needs (and pats themselves on the back for) puts us in a tricky situation where we are really doing work for the university, but taking it out of our own time and money,” she wrote. “For minority students these groups are more like a lifeline, not just a fun hobby, we need sources of support and encouragement.”
GSAS allocates funding solely to “umbrella organizations” — student groups which represent multiple demographics of marginalized students. Benavidez argued in the email that ODMA is neglecting the “pan-ethnic” definition of Latinx identity by not classifying LSA as an umbrella organization.
In response to Benavidez’s criticisms, GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an email that the school “values” its partnerships with student groups and is committed to creating an inclusive community on campus. She cited ODMA staffers’ work in helping student groups write grants, providing professional development opportunities, and attending events.
“GSAS believes that student groups are an important part of the graduate student experience and values the partnerships we maintain with them,” Hall wrote. “The Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs (ODMA) is committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive community among our underrepresented students.”
LSA President Talia Hart wrote in a Sunday email that Benavidez’s message does not represent the group’s official stance.
“The views expressed in Aaron’s email from Friday are not the collective perspectives of the LSA board as a whole and we were not consulted prior to the publication of that email,” Hart wrote.
Benavidez sent his email the same day as the school’s Newly Admitted Students’ Day. In the opening paragraph of the 3,000-word missive, he wrote that as newly admitted students visited GSAS, he wanted to make public the school’s failure to address issues of diversity.
“During the spring break, when reflecting on ODMA's recent actions, I worry that trust is eroding, more generally,” he wrote. “Indeed, this kind of message should be read as a symptom of that very problem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of several Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student groups submitted a proposal to administrators in December calling for major changes to the way GSAS and Dudley House support affinity groups.
Graduate students from Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, the W.E.B. Du Bois Graduate Society, the Harvard GSAS Latinx Student Association, and the Harvard LGBTQ@GSAS Association signed the proposal last semester. They wrote that Dudley House Faculty Deans James M. Hogle and Doreen M. Hogle — who will step down in June 2019 — and Dudley House administrator Susan Zawalich have declined to fully support their groups.
“Dudley House has perpetuated — particularly in the charge of Jim Hogle and Susan Zawalich — perspectives, politics, and policies at the GSAS organizational level that treat underrepresented students and LGBTQ students as separate and unequal,” the proposal reads.
In the document, the graduate students proposed a new framework for how Harvard handles diversity-related programming aimed at graduate students. Their suggestions come after GSAS Dean Emma Dench announced in October that Dudley House would split into two groups — the Dudley Community, which will serve undergraduates that live outside the House system, and a graduate student center housed in Lehman Hall.
The document calls on GSAS to implement 12 changes including replacing Zawalich, creating a GSAS Diversity Student Center, and increasing funds for affinity groups. The students also advocated for the creation of a diversity and inclusion committee within each department and a student-led board to oversee programming at Lehman Hall.
The students wrote that administrators should increase support structures for underrepresented minorities and BGLTQ students. They called for an increase in the number of Dudley Fellows, students who organize programming in fields including music, art, and public service. Under the proposed framework, half of the fellows would oversee diversity-related programming and half would support extracurriculars.
The proposal claims that events held at Lehman Hall have long been imbalanced and unrepresentative of the GSAS student body.
Graduate students have submitted grievances concerning the lack of Black History Month programming as early as 1996, according to the proposal. The students cited Zawalich’s February 2016 decision to host a French Film Festival in lieu of planning any Black History Month programming. They also charged that Zawalich showed “racial bias” by placing a statue of a “silent black butler” in her office.
“It may be useful to hire an independent content analyst to review and code all Dudley programming for the last five years to see how much programming has been given to represent and highlight the white European cultural experience and popular idiom,” the students wrote.
When affinity groups do host diversity-related events, Dudley House administrators have been unresponsive, according to the proposal.
In response to the criticisms laid out in the proposal, GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an email that the school remains committed to diversity-related programming.
“Staff works closely with student leaders from multiple student groups, providing administrative support and serving in an advisory capacity,” Hall wrote. “In addition to making funding available, the GSAS [Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs], Student Affairs, and Student Services teams work in an advisory capacity with all student groups in a variety of ways, including by providing grant-writing support, professional development opportunities, and through attendance at meetings and events.”
GSAS alumna Leena M. Akhtar, who graduated in 2017 and is currently a lecturer in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, provided information for the proposal in December. She wrote in an email that she believes the proposal is a positive step because of what she considers administrators’ previous inaction.
“In the course of advocating for marginalized students, I noticed that issues would be brought to the table, and perhaps meetings would be held, but that little tangible action resulted,” Akhtar wrote.
LBGTQ@GSAS member Madeleine F. Jennewein — who wrote in an email that she also gave feedback for the proposal — agreed with Akhtar. She wrote that Dudley House administrators have failed to create a positive environment for students from underrepresented backgrounds.
“At the end of the day, Harvard lags massively behind its peer institutions in matters of diversity and inclusion, and has for at least a decade,” Jennewein wrote. “This is a massive disincentive for minority students to enroll, regardless of the resources of Harvard, if we don't feel welcome, we won't come here, and I'd venture that many minority students do not feel welcome here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response kicked off Sexual Assault Awareness Month with a discussion about gender based violence and advocacy for victims of sexual assault in a panel at Memorial Church Monday evening.
The event featured four female activists who worked in the Obama administration, including Lynn Rosenthal, the first-ever White House advisor on violence against women, and Bea Hanson, the Executive Director of the New York City Domestic Violence Task Force. The panel, which garnered a crowd of roughly 100 attendees, focused on the intersection of government work and activism.
Rosenthal spoke about her efforts to help college students navigate administrative processes in reporting instances of sexual assault at their schools that she said can often turned into “victim-blaming.”
“It was about putting pressure on the administration to make a difference for the best and to change the climate,” Rosenthal said.
In addition to discussing power dynamics and reporting processes, the panelists also reflected on the challenges of navigating cultural differences and intersectionality in their work. Deesha Dyer — the special assistant to the president and social secretary in 2015 — said activists have a “duty” to reach out to other communities besides their own.
“I think what we have to do is be willing to admit that we are not experts on the topic and that we do not represent all women, all men in any which way or shape,” Dyer said. “It’s also staying in your lane of what you know.”
After the panel, Nina N. Harris — an education specialist at OSAPR who moderated the discussion — reflected on the importance of “sharing the work” of activists in this field.
“One of the things that was reflected in the conversation about just coalition building and partnerships and how significant they are with changing organizational and institutional capacity,” Harris said.
Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, who attended the event, said the discussion was timely, citing U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s new proposed Title IX rule.
“I think it’s just a really important conversation to have, to see what they think can be done now,” Mahajan said. “This does kind of give me a bit of hope for what activism can do, especially activism on this campus.”
The panel marks the first of a series of events that OSAPR will host this month, which include a study break, art exhibition, and discussion about sex and BGLTQ identity. In an email to College students Monday morning, OSAPR Director Pierre R. Berastaín Ojeda ’10 invited students to Monday’s panel as well as the rest of OSAPR’s programming “to get involved, learn more, and help raise awareness” about sexual violence and “other forms of interpersonal harm” throughout the month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Classroom to Table — a program that brings together undergraduates and their professors for College-subsidized fine dining in Harvard Square — has been cancelled mid-semester due to lack of funding for the third consecutive term.
“As we stated at the start of the term, program funding is limited,” a Wednesday afternoon update to the program’s website reads. “We have had a very successful term and have reached our funding limit.”
The popular initiative — originally piloted in fall 2015 — enables groups of three to five students to invite a Harvard faculty member for lunch or dinner at a select number of local eateries; this semester’s slate includes Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, the Hourly Oyster House, and Temple Bar. The College pays up to 30 dollars for each attendee’s meal, save alcoholic beverages.
Aman Panjwani ’20 said in a Monday interview that Classroom to Table gives him the opportunity to get to know faculty members through casual conversation that goes beyond course topics.
“It kind of breaks down the kind of, like, professor-student divide,” he said. “It makes class a lot more enjoyable for the students and helps us perform better at the end of the day as well.”
History of Science Professor Matthew H. Hersch, who teaches History of Science 189: “The World We Made: Technology and Society,” wrote in an email Sunday that Classroom to Table enables student-faculty interaction that is “difficult to come by any other way” in large lecture courses.
“An hour to talk with a professor among a small group is a real treasure, and I consider the program to be among the best demonstrations of Harvard’s commitment to undergraduate education,” Hersch wrote.
The mid-semester discontinuation comes amid a trend of rising student interest in the Classroom to Table program. An estimated total number of gatherings in fall 2018 was less than half that of the prior fall, and a projected participation count for the current term amounts to 1,414 students and 266 faculty members, according to College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman.
Over the last few semesters, administrators have implemented increasingly strict limitations on participation in order to maximize the number of students who can partake in Classroom to Table. The initiative, however, continues to hit its funding limit on a regular basis.
Students could participate in an unlimited number of meals until the Classroom to Table program first ran out of money in spring 2017. From that point forward, the Office of Undergraduate Education imposed a cap of four meals per student each semester, which was then reduced to two meals in spring 2018. Even so, the program still exhausted its budget that semester and in the following fall, marking the third consecutive time the program halted mid-semester.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh, who oversees the office responsible for administering the program, wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that she wishes the office had sufficient resources to support more opportunities for meals.
“We're delighted that so many faculty and students are so eager to meet outside of class,” she wrote.
History professor Arunabh Ghosh, who teaches History 1602: “Modern China,” wrote in an email that given a pattern of mid-semester cancellations that Classroom to Table “ought not to suffer,” he believes the College should restrict per-meal spending to accommodate student demand.
“One possible solution is to lower and better enforce the per-head allocation,” he wrote. “This will mean humbler lunches and dinners, but greater opportunity for student-faculty interaction, which, after all, is the primary objective of the program.”
Hersch also wrote that partnering with less expensive establishments in Harvard Square might enable more students to participate in the program.
Goldman did not respond to a question asking about the current sources of funding for the program or future fundraising efforts. In past years, student donations toward Senior Gift — a campaign that encourages new graduates to contribute to an “unrestricted fund” at the College and financial aid initiatives — have played a role in subsidizing the meals.

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the number of Classroom to Table meetings in fall 2018 was more than double that of fall 2017. In fact, the number of gatherings was less than half that of fall 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dean of Students Office will not be moving forward with the Experiential Learning Center, the center’s director Paul R. “Coz” Teplitz ’03-’09 announced in an email to leaders of the First-Year Outdoor Program Thursday.
Teplitz, who served as director of FOP before taking on the role of Director of Outdoor and Experiential Education in 2017, also wrote that he will be leaving Harvard with the Center’s elimination. The announcement came as part of an email to FOP leaders and trainees asking them for input in selecting a new FOP director among finalists for the position.
“On a related note, some of you know that the College has decided not to continue to pursue the Experiential Learning Center,” Teplitz wrote in the email. “FOP should be largely unaffected by the change. However, the decision has meant the elimination of my role, and I will be leaving Harvard at the end of June.”
As director of the Experiential Learning Center, Teplitz works to “encourage and support personally transformative experiences for students,” according to the DSO’s website. The center is one of several new initiatives created by the DSO when it officially opened in July 2018 as part of an effort to centralize programs formerly offered by the Office of Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alex R. Miller said in an interview last month the DSO wanted to ensure that programming for the Experiential Learning Center did not overlap significantly with pre-existing initiatives.
“We were seeing pieces of the programming already happening,” Miller said. “What we’ve done is taken this opportunity to rethink the programming that’s already happening and look at what we were trying to accomplish with that center and see what we can now offer to students.”
DSO spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment further on the decision to eliminate the Experiential Learning Center. Teplitz did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the termination of his role as director of the center.
Noah A. Fanous ’19, who served on the FOP Steering Committee in 2018, wrote in an email he thinks Teplitz has made a significant impact on the program during his tenure as director since 2010.
“I can just briefly mention that Coz Teplitz will be greatly missed at Harvard and, especially for FOP,” Fanous wrote. “For the past couple of years, he’s been the center of thousands of first-years’ introductions to Harvard and has been instrumental in the successful training of hundreds of Harvard’s greater leader community.”
Cailey Martin ’20, who has been a FOP leader for the past two years, also praised Teplitz’s impact on FOP leaders as well as incoming freshmen.
“Both in terms of the program, but also in terms of personally for many FOP leaders, I think he has served as an inspiring figure for many of us, and brought so much dedication and care to the program,” Martin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning from a week of travel in the West Coast featuring in which the No. 14 Crimson women’s water polo team took on several nationally ranked opponents, Harvard found itself back on the East Coast this weekend. Traveling to Washington, D.C., the Crimson sought to look past last week’s loss to No. 2 ranked Stanford.
“We knew that it was going to be a tough game,” said senior attacker Kristen Hong, reflecting on the matchup against Stanford, who currently have a record of 15-1 and knocked off No. 1 USC this weekend. “But, we were going into it thinking about the lessons that we could take away and bring back to the East Coast to help win an East Coast championship.”
The Crimson bounced back strong, taking all three matches in the weekend slate.
Starting with Saturday morning’s match against St. Francis, Harvard dominated its opponents offensively. The Crimson started the game out hot, responding to a St. Francis goal with seven of its own. Possessing a comfortable five-goal leading heading into the second half, Harvard looked to extrapolate its commanding play into the final stretch.
And it did just that. The Crimson ended the day scoring 13 goals to the Red Flash’s six, with scoring contributions from eight different players.
However, the game was much more than another conference win for Hong. The squad’s leading scorer last year, tallying 71 goals in the 2018 campaign, Hong entered the weekend just shy of the program’s career-goals goals record held by her former teammate Yoshi Andersen, who scored 248 during her time with the Crimson. Recording a hat-trick against St. Francis put Hong ahead of Andersen and first in Harvard’s all-time goals list.
“I'm just very thankful to have such amazing teammates because without them it wouldn't be possible for me to come close to this,” Hong said. “It's about making the reads, getting each other open, and that type of teamwork helped me get here so I'm really thankful that I played with such amazing girls.”
Harvard claimed the first match of the weekend against St. Francis, 13-6.
Shortly after the first game, Harvard was set to face off against George Washington, the host of the weekend’s matches.
The offensive prowess continued to show for the Crimson in their second match-up, as Harvard jumped out to a lead of eight goals to one. During this half, Hong continued her scoring run, surpassing the 250 career-goal mark. Defensive stops in the third quarter prevented George Washington from closing the gap, as another impressive showing by freshman keeper Zoe Banks held the Colonials to four goals on the game. The Crimson ended the afternoon match with eighteen goals, comfortably outpacing George Washington’s 4 and advancing to the next day to face Bucknell.
“Having a strong freshman class, returning a lot of scoring threats, and being able to shoot from anywhere in the pool makes it really hard for other teams to guard,” Hong said.
The final game of the weekend featured a rematch against No. 24 Bucknell, where Harvard’s eight goals edged out the Bison’s six in the first meeting between the two squads at the Harvard Invite.
The rematch was another close one, as the Crimson’s offensive ability was challenged by Bucknell’s own hot start. The teams saw themselves with eight goals apiece entering the half. Although the close contest continued into the beginning of the third period, the Crimson broke out in a scoring run led by junior co-captain and attacker Sofia Carrera-Justiz, who ended the game with a season-high five goals, contributing three assists in the match as well. Clawing back late, Bucknell scored to bring the lead down to two goals. However, playing against the clock, the Bison’s 13 scores were not enough to top Harvard’s 15.
With the weekend sweep over conference opponents, the Crimson improved its record to 18-4 heading into the final stretch of games before the CWPA championship. Up next for Harvard is another weekend in Blodgett Pool, where seniors Haley Bowe, Hong, and co-captain Sam Acker will be honored in their last home games. The Crimson will be facing the same three conference opponents next weekend, hoping to extend their win-streak to six.
“I'm excited to have our senior game and face off against the same three teams as last weekend,” Hong said. “Everyone is getting ready for this championship tournament and we are looking really good so I'm excited to see how it all pans out after that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a spring break that consisted of training and competing in Houston, Harvard outdoor track and field continued to leave a dent in the school record books this past weekend, splitting up to compete against some of the best athletes in the country at the Texas Relays, Raleigh Relays, and UMass Lowell Invitational. There were a slew of personal and season bests from the Crimson athletes, boding well for their development in upcoming meets on the way to Ivy Heps.
Texas Relays
Coming down to Texas for a second consecutive weekends, both the Harvard men’s and women’s relay teams had stellar performances, exceeding expectations for the Crimson.
The men’s team consisted of the same group that brought home the Ivy Heps title in the 4x400 during the indoor season. The relay consisting of sophomore sprinters Rodney Agyare-May, Jovahn Williamson, and Kahlil Wassell along with senior middle distance runner Myles Marshall qualified for the finals and ran the second-fastest time in Harvard history with its mark of 3:10.05.
On the women’s side, the 4x400 team showed their versatility as athletes by compromising a group that consisted of both sprinters and hurdlers. Sophomore sprinter Olivia Okoli ran with freshman hurdler Sharelle Samuel and junior hurdlers Karina Joiner and Maya Miklos to qualify for the finals with a time of 3:43.31. Miklos ran one of the fastest splits with a 53.64 400.
Freshman thrower Sam Welsh also had a great performance in Austin competing against some of the best in the nation at the discus. The Lunenburg, Mass. native just came off a great performance at the Victor Lopez Invitational the previous week where he won the discus with a mark of 56.57m.
“It was amazing to throw against the best in the country as a freshman," Welsh said. “The competition gave me experience throwing at a national caliber meet, which will help me for the rest of the season. I look forward to facing them again in future competitions and next time, I’ll be ready to give them a good fight.”
Facing such stellar competition puts Harvard in a position where it can feel confident against the rest of its Ancient Eight competitors. This experience helps to prepare the team for both Ivy Heps and NCAAs later on.
“The competition at the Texas relays was on par with NCAAs, which will take place in June at the same venue,” Welsh said. “Being able to compete at a big meet like the Texas relays early in the season is great because it helps us to gain experience competing against athletes we will face again at nationals and Ivy Heps.”
Raleigh Relays
The distance team headed to North Carolina where the reigning Indoor Ivy heps 3000m and 5000m champion junior distance runner Kieran Tuntivate continued to excel. Tuntivate placed sixth in the 10000m with a mark of 28:45.61, a time that broke the program record and surpassed the 28:55.64 mark of Paul Gomper ’87.
Personal and season records were also set on the women’s distance team in the Raleigh Relays. Senior distance runner Kathryn Gillespie placed 15th in the 1500m with a time of 4:23.24, while sophomore distance runner Anna Juul placed 19th in the same event, earning a new personal best of 4:24.27.
UMass Lowell Invitational
The team’s jumpers and underclassmen sprinters were able to showcase their abilities in Lowell, Mass. In both the 100m and 200m, freshmen sprinters Tina Martin and Katina Martin were able to place first and second in their events. Sophomore jumper Iza Sabharwal had a second place finish in the long jump (5.29m) and a first place finish in the triple jump (10.71m).
On the men’s side, senior pole vaulter Ian West built off his fourth place finish at Indoor Ivy Heps and placed second with a mark of 4.60m. Freshmen sprinter Max Serrano-Wu finished third in the 400m with a time of 51.23, an impressive mark he hopes to build upon.
“My coach and I had talked about my race plan during the week,” Serrano-Wu said. “For the 400m, I would go out hard for the first 150m, stay relaxed and smooth for the next 100m, then give it my all for the last 150m. While I'm definitely happy about my 3rd place finish, I am disappointed with my overall time in the 400m, as I was hoping to closer to 50 seconds flat. I didn't run my race plan entirely correct, but for the first meet of the season I'm happy to have competed and get some races under my belt going into our next meet in a couple of weeks.”
Competing all across the country, the Crimson used its performances this past weekend to gain the edge it needs going into the rest of its season.
“We're using all these different meets as opportunities to prepare for the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in Princeton in May, where we hope to improve on our 2nd place finish [for the women] and 3rd place finish [for the men] from the indoor championships,” Serrano-Wu said. “There were many PR's set this weekend, so we'll reflect on our performance and use it as a boost for the next coming meets.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was only fitting, on a night when Harvard men’s baseball and Northeastern would combine to score seven runs on just three total hits, that Kevin Stone and Kieran Shaw would pitch the Crimson into the Championship game of the 2019 Beanpot.
Despite a sloppy affair that saw more combined errors between the two teams than hits, a four-run fifth-inning outburst from Harvard (13-6, 4-2 Ivy) proved to be the difference. Coupled with nine solid innings from the Crimson pitching staff, three unearned runs helped the men from Cambridge hold on for a 4-3 victory, giving the team the opportunity to win the tournament for a second straight season.
“The Beanpot’s a pretty fun thing we get to do,” Stone said. “It’s super exciting and very meaningful to make it to the final in my senior season.”
Harvard’s defense of its 2018 title kicked off Tuesday night at Boston College, against crosstown rival Northeastern. The Huskies were a familiar foe for the Crimson, as the semifinal was a rematch of last year’s Beanpot title game, a contest that saw Harvard surrender six first-inning runs, but storm back for a dramatic 8-6 victory.
Like in the 2018 Championship game, Stone toed the rubber to start for the Crimson. The fourth-year starter put Harvard in position to secure the victory, tossing five hitless innings, but conceded five walks that accounted for two Northeastern runs. Despite falling behind like it did in the 2018 final, Harvard battled back, riding Stone’s strong performance and rewarding the senior with the semifinal win, allowing him to improve to 2-1 on the season.
“Gotta come out in attack mode, and I didn’t quite do that,” Stone said of his early struggles. “Just being able to make the adjustment and refocus after that first inning was huge for me.”
The senior, the elder statesman of the staff, has adapted to a different role than he has been accustomed to over the first three years of his career. Previously a stalwart in the weekend starting rotation, the Stamford, Conn., native has taken his transition to spot starts with grace, a testament to the team-first mentality that his teammates admire about him.
“This year we had some other guys step up, and Kev was given a new role,” said Stone’s battery-mate, senior catcher Jake Allen. “Kev has done an absolutely great job of taking that role and running with it.”
The Crimson carried positive momentum from its Spring Break training trip and the early Ivy League season into Tuesday night, a welcome sight for a team looking to establish self as the cream of the Ancient Eight, as well as the Massachusetts schools. Harvard had taken 2-of-3 games at Penn and at home against Princeton last weekend, setting the team up well for a six-game homestand against Yale and Cornell.
First baseman Patrick McColl entered the semifinal with a torrid start to the season, which saw him reach No. 1 in the country in batting average last week. But the senior was held down by the Huskies’ pitching, as was standout right fielder Jake Suddleson, who has shown exceptional power throughout the year thus far.
McColl and Suddleson were limited to a combined 0-of-6, with both reaching and scoring through bases on balls. Their runs, along with a Chad Minato single and a Northeastern fielding error, were enough offense for the entire evening for the defending champions.
In the sixth inning senior John MacLean, relieving Stone, came up with a huge strikeout with bases loaded to get out of the inning with the lead. MacLean, despite giving up a run in the frame, was a key bridge to the latter innings, tossing two innings of one-run ball, logging four strikeouts in the process. Freshman Harrison Stovern locked down the eighth inning without allowing a baserunner, setting the stage for junior closer Kieran Shaw to continue what has already been a historic season.
“I saw the staff do what they do best,” Allen said. “Fill up the zone, and every once in a while battle through the adversity.”
Shaw, who has already set the single-season record in saves for Harvard, locked down yet another flawless finish to a victory, despite lacking a single insurance run to work with. The Los Gatos, Calif., native entered the ninth inning, and secured the win with a flourish, mowing down the top of the Huskies’ lineup in 1-2-3 fashion for his ninth save this campaign.
“Kieran’s another guy who, first year or two, has been trying to figure out exactly his role on the team,” Allen said. “It’s been pretty cool to see him on the mound, I mean, I’m intimidated and I’m catching him.”
In the other semifinal, the University of Massachusetts defeated Boston College on the Eagles’ home diamond, winning by a 6-2 margin. Despite an abysmal 5-15 start to the season, the Minutemen advanced to the championship game, looking to secure the school’s first Beanpot Championship since the 2012 season.
The final will take place two weeks from tomorrow, on the afternoon of Wednesday April 17th. Harvard will have the opportunity to take the Fenway Park field that afternoon and secure a Beanpot championship, a dream come true for many Boston-area players donning the Crimson colors.
“It’s super exciting being a Red Sox fan, playing at Fenway, you feel like a little kid,” said Stone of the prospect of locking down a Beanpot title at Fenway Park. “It’s gonna be a moment I never forget for the rest of my life.”

Now that Harvard acceptances are out, a lucky 4.5 percent of applicants get to proudly say that they’re coming to Harvard next year. Sometimes, however, that college announcement process isn’t quite as easy as it seems.
DO: Post where you will be going to school next year
College is a big deal and most of your friends and family will be wondering where you will be going. You clearly worked hard and got into, objectively, the best Ivy League school. Make sure to tag your post with #Harvard2023 and check out the hashtag to see and be seen by your new classmates.
DON’T: Post all your acceptances
While many people care deeply about you, no one cares to see the long (or short) list of where you were accepted to college. Nobody has ever been impressed by an “Anybody else deciding between Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT?” post; you just look arrogant. We know it’s hard for you to decide, but we don’t need to be privy to your decision (and neither do the thousands of people who got rejected).
DO: Get a few pieces of Harvard Merch
Once you have decided you are a future member of the Crimson, it is important to get swag to match. Check out the COOP, or apparently even H&M or Forever 21, for some Harvard gear. Get a t-shirt, sweatshirt, classic H sweater, or even a tasteful Veritas tattoo above your eyebrow to show your school pride. Just make sure that Harvard gear does not become the only thing in your wardrobe.
DON’T: Ever explicitly say you go to Harvard
Saying you go to Harvard, or dropping the H-bomb, as some may say, is never to be done when first meeting someone. Start by saying you go to school in Boston, and those in the know will get your Crimson connection. If people press on, continue to get more specific about the location. I go to school in Cambridge…next to the Charles River...between MIT and Tufts...by the Harvard Square T stop.
DO: Connect with your fellow classmates to talk about Harvard
Harvard 2023 already has a Facebook group that is up and running, as well as many group chats based on location, potential concentrations, or interests. Join these groups so you can talk about how excited you are about Harvard, without seeming like you are constantly flexing.
