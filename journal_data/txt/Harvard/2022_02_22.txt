The songs are about workplace homoeroticism. The bass is mind-melting. There are laser show interludes, and three costume changes in one concert. This is Dorian Electra at their finest.
Last Saturday night, the crowd at The Royale nightclub was about 69 percent gayer than usual. Emo teens in cat ears, cottagecore lesbians branching out in their witchy Demonias, and thirty-year-olds in flannel and fishnets were all existing in discordant ecstasy. For many concert-goers, dressing up is an integral part of the experience. The Dorian Electra concert was no different. It’s a way to express yourself, show solidarity with specific aesthetics or subcultures, and to become part of the show before it has even begun.
Wailing synths and deep bass thrummed through a screaming crowd as a raspy voice called out for Dorian Electra to take the stage. Then, a figure in tight black latex, a floor-length black cape, dagger-sharp shoulder pads, and what can only be described as a goth fedora appeared onstage. They stood frozen with their back turned to the audience, suffused in the acid-green stage light until the beat dropped, lights started flashing, and the crowd went wild. Special effects made the stage appear to glitch in and out of focus. Combined with Electra’s stylized choreography, Electra themself became like a pixelated, life-size avatar.
The concert began with “F the World,” the first song on Electra’s newest project, “MY AGENDA,” which pokes fun at toxic masculinity and online culture through a queer lens. In the song, Electra takes on the persona of a bitter incel who simultaneously hates and loves the world, using exaggeratedly violent imagery and tongue-in-cheek references to parody incel culture. Coupled with a fast, thumping beat, the song is both a dark look into the inner mind of an extreme misogynist, as well as an upbeat, hype vibe. These bops transitioned into the sparkly, cotton-candy tracks about being the perfect man such as “Barbie Boy” and “MY AGENDA” while the crowd chanted along.
Electra was joined by two backup dancers dressed in strappy black leotards who swayed, vogued, and waved rainbow pride flags, lifting Electra above the air like some kind of cyberpunk-inspired cheerleading squad. Electra also added humorously self-effacing, theatrical touches with exaggerated fedora hat tips and elaborate choreography performed with an actual sword.
Electra also performed songs from their debut album, “FLAMBOYANT,” such as “Adam & Steve,” a soaring, choral-inspired track about queer love, with lyrics like “God made me and Adam and Steve / And he loves me.” After the end of the concert, shouts of “One more song!” saw Electra back onstage to perform two songs, “Replay” and “Career Boy.” The latter, which parodies nine-to-five grind culture and capitalism, drew cheers of recognition from the crowd.
After the concert ended, people stayed and milled around, shyly complimenting each other on their glittery shoulder pads, cow-themed stockings, or pink latex two-pieces. Elsewhere, a trio of furries posed for pictures. When the house lights went on, the illuminated space revealed individuals of all ages and identities who had come together for a night of queer, campy catharsis. For these fans, going to a Dorian Electra concert isn’t just about screaming along to the lyrics like “Hit me with your ledger” and “I'm a very flaming flammable guy” and getting tinnitus. It's about being part of a community with a bunch of other quirky, glittery, proudly over-the-top fans. It’s about being yourself, whatever that looks like. At a Dorian Electra concert, everyone can be a flaming flammable guy. Or a Barbie boy. Or anything at all.

Teenage vice, creative makeup, nail, and costume designs, and incredible levels of drama all define what is arguably one of the best and most popular TV shows of recent years. “Euphoria” is chock-full of tense relationship fumbles and triumphs. But amid the drama actor’s performances, their script, and the setting, another dimension of the show appears: the music.
“Euphoria”’s soundtrack is integral to its narrative primarily because its instrumentals match the moodiness and angst of the characters. Labrinth’s “All for Us” — part of the critically acclaimed songwriter’s contributions as lead composer for “Euphoria” — serve as a prime example for how the soundtrack embodies the characters’ angsts and emotions. The song, which serves as the show’s main theme, runs parallel to the show’s own raw emotions. As a theme, “All for Us” encaptures much of the electric and dream-like energy that resonates in the show. The track starts out with an ethereal, gospel-like chorus that echoes for 26 seconds and quickly transitions to a series of mechanical sounds that create a dissonant harmony. As the beats and buzzes fade into the background, Zendaya (who has a feature on the song) takes center stage with moody vocals — “Too much in my system … money M.I.A” — with Labrinth’s deep voice and ad-libs adding a stark and moody contrast to Zendaya’s voice.
It’s easy to see just how much of the show is tied to its musical content. Almost every scene features a different song, adding further depth and emotion to an already hard-hitting script. Music is as necessary for “Euphoria” as its actors’ performances, the costume and makeup design, and the plot.
In an interview with Vanity Fair, “Euphoria”’s music supervisor Jen Malone described the arduous and dynamic process of creating the musical character of each episode. One of the greatest challenges being that it is a multidimensional realm where the only criteria for the music at hand is to match the theme of the scene. In fact, “Euphoria”’s additions of music to the background of a scene fit so seamlessly in that music has become an omnipresence — not just for the audience, but also the actors.
An added element to the use of music in “Euphoria” is that a lot of those more emotional and memorable moments are set to music that is diegetic — moments where the music is a part of the scene and setting and thus heard by the characters. By integrating the score into the screenplay, the audience feels one step closer to the characters, just by virtue of hearing and feeling the same things that the music is making the character feel. Music is emotional, just as acting is, and “Euphoria” capitalizes on the sentimentality of lyrics and melodies to add intimacy for its audience, beyond the dialogue and character interactions that create the basis of the show’s drama.
“Euphoria,” at its core, is a show depicting a hyper-sensational version of American suburbia. It shows some of the greatest moments of both teenage angst and exhilaration and does not hesitate to portray some of life’s greatest struggles and tribulations. For a show that touches different individuals in different ways, there needs to be a next level of emotional reach. It’s simply no wonder that music has been used in such a way for “Euphoria” as well: to translate to a larger audience the turbulence of spirit and soul that oftentimes acting alone cannot accomplish.

Under almost any circumstances, a title like the “Art of Joy Tour'' would come across as corny and over-the-top. Andy Grammer, performing in Boston’s Orpheum Theatre on Feb. 9, somehow managed to live up to his magnanimous tour name, delivering enough earnestness to melt even the coldest cynic’s heart. Even in a venue better equipped for a musical than a pop-rock concert, Grammer managed to immediately raise the crowd to their feet, running through a setlist that was equal parts energizing and heartfelt. Commanding the stage with an unwavering optimism, Grammer seemed positively determined to make sure every audience member walked out of the Orpheum with their heads held a little higher, their hearts a little more open, and maybe even with a new “lease on life.”
The opener, Alt Bloom, immediately set the tone for the entire concert with an array of upbeat and catchy pop tracks. When Grammer finally took the stage, dressed in a varsity jacket and a pair of plaid pants, he launched not into a song but a passionately-delivered poem. The audience listened with rapt attention to this first spoken word piece, making his sudden shift to his new single “Damn It Feels Good To Be Me,” complete with trumpet blasts and a riveting saxophone, all the more magical.
Striking a proper balance between the old and the new, the singer-songwriter alternated between fan-favorites like his career-launching “Keep Your Head Up” and “Fresh Eyes” as well as new tunes he wrote over quarantine — including a supposed love song to himself (“Love Myself”) and one addressed to his newborn daughter (“Good Man”). Already known for his career-defining hits, equal parts pop, rock, country, and R&B, Grammer managed to blend these various styles even further with some cleverly designed mashups. While his incredibly popular “Honey, I’m Good” might have been played to death on the radio in 2014, Grammer breathed new life into the chart-topper by remixing it with Earth, Wind & Fire’s classic “September” — an idea he said he got from a TikTok user. This groovy moment wasn’t the only one inspired by the video-sharing app: Grammer also performed a dynamic cover of Louis Prima’s “Pennies from Heaven,” a 1930s jazz tune that blew up on the platform around Christmas time in 2020, claiming it was impossible to listen to the song and not feel happy.
A testament to the reciprocal relationship between artist and audience, Grammer seemed to derive as much energy and giddiness from the crowd as his fans were feeling from his set. Beyond the standard “Boston, we love you!” proclamations, Andy got his fans directly involved in his music-making, teaching them the chorus of a new song — “Love, it’s the new money” — and recording the audience’s singing as part of the ongoing project.
While joy and celebration were the motifs tying together Grammer’s charismatic performance, he also proved to be an incredibly vulnerable artist. As Grammer made the effort to get to know his audience a little better, he likewise let his guard down and shared deeply personal and rather dark moments from his own life. Instead of bringing down the overall happy mood, these serious moments made the joyful ones all the more cathartic. For instance, midway through the show, he performed, “She’d Say,” a touching tribute to his late mother where he explains to his daughter all the advice her grandmother might have given her if she were still here. Grammer shared with the audience that his mother died of breast cancer when he was 25. Towards the end of her life, she had told him that everytime he heard a Billy Joel song, it meant she was saying “hi” to him from beyond the grave. Flash forward to the day of the Boston concert, when Grammer noticed the caterer for the Orpheum Theater wearing a Billy Joel sweatshirt, a coincidence he interpreted as a loving sign from his mom. To top it all off, Grammer learned that the caterer’s name was also Joy, just like the title of his tour, and invited her on stage for a proper serenade.
Nothing quite compares to watching a talented performer completely in their element, sharing their art with an undeniable, infectious passion. Yes, Grammer knows how to write catchy songs that will get his crowds up on their feet dancing, but more importantly, he also knows how to make these same people feel deeply loved and appreciated, with a warm, fuzzy feeling that lingers long after the stage lights have gone out.

Join Crimson Arts staff writers Rhea L. Acharya ‘25 and Karen Z. Song ‘25 as they speak to Harvard students about the ways that art affects their daily lives.
This week, we spoke to Lana R. Wagner ‘25, a jazz enthusiast and mechanical engineering concentrator. Our conversation ranged from her love of music and role as WHRB Jazz Comp Director to how her passion for sewing intersects with her Mechanical Engineering Concentration. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? 
I'm from New York City. I'm a freshman intending on concentrating in mechanical engineering. On campus, my main artistic passion is WHRB, the radio. I comped last semester, and I really enjoyed my time doing that because I got to be exposed to this very passionate group of people who really care about music and arts. With my mechanical engineering background, I have interests in audio and the tech department and the jazz department. I loved listening to jazz when I was a kid, and got back into it maybe like my sophomore year of high school. So when I saw that the radio had its own jazz department, I was like, “This sounds perfect for me.”
Now, I'm comp director, and I have my own show every Monday from 5 to 7 a.m.. I've really enjoyed going into the jazz lounge at WHRB and just picking out random vinyls. I find it very satisfying to take this physical media and representation of art and put all this care into queuing up the vinyl, making sure the audio sounds right, and then playing it on air.
How does art factor into your day to day life? 
With engineering, I do think there's a bit of an art to what I do. In lab sessions last semester, I took ES 50, which is the intro mechanical engineering class. And besides the material you learn in lectures… we were building these little 12 by 12 inch robots. There's a creative aspect to that, marrying the functional design elements and then also the more pretty stuff. Art impacts the lens I bring towards my engineering coursework. And then also, generally music is such a huge part of my life. I studied both piano and cello as a kid and always had a big appreciation for music. A lot of my time when I'm not in class is spent discovering new music and honing my Spotify playlists.
Are there any particular artists you’ve been listening to recently? 
With regard to jazz, I've been on a Bill Evans kick as of late. I absolutely love his work. He's a fantastic pianist and happened to go to the music school where I spent my weekends in childhood. I've always been kind of a ’60s and ’70s music fan, and recently I've been expanding that taste to be a bit more international. So I've been getting into Japanese city pop. That's really fantastic because it combines the ’70s soft rock elements that I really love with more jazz-inspired solos. It’s a very great genre that kind of combines all my interests.
Some of my favorite artists that I always love and always go back to are Todd Rundgren, who's this fantastic producer and artist, who mainly made music in the ’70s but still does a lot of stuff now, and Steely Dan — an absolute classic.
Can you talk a little bit more about the role fashion plays in your life? 
I always had an interest in sewing but developed my interest in fashion throughout high school. With sewing, I got into that maybe around age 10. I tried hand sewing clothes for my dolls because I didn't really like the clothes that they had and I had extra scraps of fabric laying around the house. So I found an interest in designing garments on a small scale for my dolls. Eventually, I got a sewing machine and learned how to use it. It's like the whole engineering hands-on design process. I've always been interested in making things and building things and just tinkering. It’s very cool to be involved with making a garment from the ground up and having this garment that fits me the way I want it to.
I had taken a hiatus from sewing throughout high school, but during the pandemic in my senior spring, I did a little project with a friend where we bought some vintage patterns off of eBay to work with. And that kickstarted my obsession with sewing again. When I sew, I feel like the time passes very quickly. I can just sit down and sew for like 10 hours straight.
My love for fashion also goes hand in hand with music. Getting into the ’60s, ’70s era of music got me into vintage fashion as well. Nowadays, there's generally been a trend towards sustainable, secondhand fashion. So, sophomore and junior year of high school, I got very into Depop and online thrifting, and it made me have more of an appreciation for garments and the work that goes into making one, which contributed to my sewing.
What in particular makes you feel drawn toward ’60s and ’70s fashion and music? 
It was experimental for the time, or at least the music that I choose to consume from that era was. It was like pushing the boundaries. Todd Rundgren is an absolute genius. Two of his best albums for the ’70s are titled “Something/Anything?” and “A Wizard, a True Star.” Those kinds of albums really pushed the boundaries of modern music and the idea of a concept album. I appreciate the forward thinking spirit of the ’60s and ’70s. And it's just nice to listen to.
What has inspired you lately? 
For sewing, the main place where I get inspiration is on Depop. There are a lot of different sellers who have a real love and appreciation for these vintage garments.
Last year, I got very into ’70s prairie dresses. Seeing all the lace and the handwork detail inspires me. I’ll take details from that and use it later. And then also on YouTube, there's a small subsection of historical fashion YouTubers, like Bernadette Banner. She's fantastic, and she's very focused on the Edwardian era, pre[-]1900s. Learning about dress construction and stuff from back then is very interesting and inspires me to do more sewing.
What do you think is your biggest art hot take? 
The Beatles are kind of mid. I just think The Beatles are something that I would play to my toddler. But I wouldn’t go and really just sit down and listen to the Beatles and have an intellectual experience. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up listening to The Beatles — my parents are both very into classical music. I didn't have the typical “Listen to Dad Rock with your dad” childhood.
—Staff Writers Rhea L. Acharya ‘25 and Karen Z. Song ‘25’s column “Impressions” explores what it means for life to imitate art, or for art to imitate life. How do seemingly superficial aesthetics define the human experience? Join them in conversation with Harvard students as they talk about the impressions art leaves on them and those that they hope to leave on the world.

Famous philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Jean-Paul Sartre may have massively shifted our discourse on the meaning of morality, but they are certainly not known for having succinct or approachable writing styles. Creating an overview of their massively influential yet arguably quite boring works that is an easy, enjoyable read is no simple task. Despite these odds, writer and producer Michael Schur somehow manages to craft a beginner’s guide to moral philosophy that is equal parts humorous, relevant, and educational with his debut book “How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question.”
Schur, known for his work on successful sitcoms such as “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” conducted tons of research in this branch of philosophy when he decided to create the smash hit “The Good Place.” Clearly developing a passion for the subject over the show’s four-year runtime, Schur decided to channel this acquired information into what is essentially an “Ethics For Dummies” manual, with help from an actual expert in moral philosophy, Professor Todd May.
Without the comedic presence of Ted Danson and Kristen Bell or the engaging adventure plotline of “The Good Place” to bring these convoluted questions about morality alive, “How to Be Perfect” could have easily felt like an assigned reading from a textbook. Instead, the book’s amusing, obviously hyperbolic title sets the tone for what amounts to a tongue-in-cheek exploration of the main schools of ethical thought going all the way back to Aristotle. With hilariously absurd thought experiments and snarky footnotes, Schur makes the typically dry subject matter endlessly entertaining.
Just to provide a little flavor of Schur’s conversational tone, here’s an actual title of one of the book’s chapters: “I Gave a Twenty-Seven-Cent Tip to My Barista, and Now Everyone’s Yelling at Me on Twitter, Just Because I’m a Billionaire! I Can’t Even Enjoy the Soft-Shell Crab Rolls That My Sushi Chef Made for My Private Dirigible Trip to the Dutch Antilles! How Is That Fair?!” Not only does the incredibly casual writing style makes the book accessible to a large demographic of readers, its self-deprecating, decidedly unserious nature also prevents Schur from sounding excessively preachy. While discussing lofty ideas such as universal maxims and the definition of happiness, Schur still manages to come across as totally down-to-earth, never promoting his above-average knowledge of ethics as evidence of his moral superiority.
Yes, many of the philosophical ideas discussed are hundreds of years old, but Schur convincingly proves why these same explorations into morality remain as pressing as ever — even if some jokes and modern examples are needed to spruce them up. Whether it’s current questions of public safety and sacrifice posed by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, scrutiny over the moral obligations of billionaires to donate to charitable causes instead of space joy rides, or the struggle to separate the art from the artists when once beloved celebrities are exposed for heinous behavior, Schur demonstrates that a book like “Nicomachean Ethics” written in 340 BCE can still provide insightful guidance.
Schur even does some of his own theorizing, by coining a useful new term, “moral exhaustion.” It refers to the tiresome modern phenomenon where every single action one takes seems directly tied to some dire ethical question that will result in judgment from others, largely thanks to the explosion of information online. In the Internet era where so much knowledge is just a Google search away, Schur ponders, “how do we escape the guilt (or shame) that comes from learning about our unintentionally bad decisions?” Fans of Schur’s comedic voice will find plenty to chuckle about through the text. However, it is Schur’s sharp observations about the increasing burden of ethical questions in modern capitalist life that leave the strongest impression.
Sorry to disappoint anyone who wanted to find black-and-white solutions to all of life’s knottiest, most daunting dilemmas: Schur does not actually provide them, and that’s ironically the whole point of “How to Be Perfect.” If he provides any concrete takeaway message, it’s simply this: Do not let the ambiguity of ethics paralyze you. Of course, do not actually pursue perfection, but also do not use this lack of obvious answers as an excuse to simply do nothing. There are no entirely correct answers, but there is at least one wrong one: Never bothering to at least strive for self-improvement.
As Schur writes in the touching coda addressed to his children, “Keep trying. Keep trying. Keep trying.”

Four misfits walk onto a luxury yacht and what follows is two hours filled with eccentric characters, clever jokes, and some good old-fashioned petty drama.
“Ship Happens,” staged by Hasty Pudding Theatricals and directed by Larry Sousa, runs from Feb. 6 to March 6 and follows Millie Onstospend, the wealthy CEO of World Corp on her quest to pick her successor as she moves on with her life to run to be the Queen of England. The candidates vying for CEO? The vengeful inventor of a remote-controlled iceberg, Greenland’s ex-dictator, a self-absorbed male model, and a luggage attendant pretending to be a world famous adventurer with some personal assistants (both robot and human), and a stowaway thrown into the mix. The characters of “Ship Happens” may at first seem like little more than caricatures that get some good laughs in along the way. But upon closer look, their self-discovery and personal growth draw the audience into the light-hearted and well-produced play.
The plot can be a little hard to follow at times due to the musical nature of the production and because there are so many moving pieces and characters to keep track of. Some parts of the performance can seem random, such as a plotline that revolves around sneezing or a segment at the end of the show where the ensemble launches into a highly-choreographed, several-minute-long kickline that screams 1980s, featuring brightly-colored and perfectly-coordinated costumes.
But the chaos that characterizes “Ship Happens” is good-natured. This spontaneity and eccentricity simply add to the joy the show brings. And once the viewer becomes more familiar with the ensemble cast, it is easy to become quickly invested in the show and root for its protagonists.
A major strength of the play is that it engages with the audience through distinctly Harvard-specific references throughout its runtime. Some lines such as the mention of the Tasty Burger bus crash (“If I were you, I’d become Tasty Burger and get hit by a bus.”) or dialogue poking fun at The Crimson (“Inspiration can come from the meekest, smallest, dingiest places, just look at The Harvard Crimson.”), are particularly relevant.
“Ship Happens” further extends this interaction by having dialogue directly pointed at audience members or drawing attention to moments that would otherwise be ignored. At one point, for example, the characters marvel at the closing of the curtain. At another moment, a member of the Hasty Pudding Band stands up to further the show’s commentary on the “Level 5 Stink” that the band exudes and jokingly asks the audience to keep young children away.
The show pays great attention to detail. Each character’s first and last name form a pun that connects to their storyline — for example, “Lotta Baggage” or “Ida Zervbetter” — striking a balance between cute and cheesy. The costume directors do a fabulous job of working within Covid-19 limitations, using matching masks, some even featuring add-ons like mustaches, as an entertaining addition to the costume.
The unconventional nature of the characters adds value to the production on a narrative level. Through this all, the show pays particular attention to Lotta's struggle with her conflicting identities, and the backlash from others on the yacht. As the story progresses, she grows more confident as she stops hiding her real self and striving to live up to someone else’s ideal.
Beneath the showy costumes, lines that are both heartwarming and corny, and well-timed jokes about Harvard, “Ship Happens” portrays a nuanced story about the power of embracing who you truly are without letting the world’s opinion interfere.

A stream of eager visitors lined up at the Harvard Coop the night of Feb. 16, not to shop for university merchandise, but rather to catch a first glimpse of $35 million worth of art by world-renowned artist Banksy.
To mark the start of its 60-day presentation, “The Art of Banksy,” held an exclusive preview for press and invitees, presented by StarVox Exhibits. The show, which features iconic images such as “Girl with Balloon” and “Flower Thrower,” has drawn from collections across the globe to amass the largest assembly of privately-owned Banksy art yet.
“This is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see these pieces that otherwise would be in warehouses, in private collections, in the homes of rich and famous people,” Producer Corey Ross said during his opening remarks at the event.
After touring in cities around the world, the exhibit has come to Boston and set up shop in the Coop. According to Ross, transforming a space intended for retail into one for display has been a difficult task.
“One of the big things we do is…repurposing spaces that are not traditional art galleries,” Ross said. “One of the reasons we do that is I think the art shows better, and it meets new patrons.”
Acacia A. Gibson, who works for Carol Fox and Associates, the firm promoting the show’s arrival in Boston, said that Harvard Square is a prime location for reaching diverse audiences. Ross also commended the site, mentioning that Banky’s defiant message complements the locale.
“I just thought to do a political artist here right in the heart of where all the students are and where a lot of the politics happen in Boston made it the right spot,” Ross said.
Event attendee Derek P. Zagami said that Cambridge is lucky to host a show that has traveled the world. “This is something different and I feel as though different is what people need right now,” Zagami said.
Ross described “Girl with Balloon” and “Flower Thrower” as the “Mona Lisas of Banksy,” but he believes that everyone will find a piece that speaks to them.
“There's just a lot of fun different pieces up there that make you laugh, make you think, and are really amazing to see all in one place,” Ross said. “It's amazing how he's managed to create these kinda sticky, memorable images that are both comedic and political.”
Indeed, different displays stuck out to different guests as they perused the exhibit. Zagami’s favorite was Banksy’s infamous prank in 2006 that planted altered, satirical versions of Paris Hilton’s debut album in music stores across the U.K. Gibson liked “Have a Nice Day,” a print of military personnel with smiley faces superimposed on their heads.
“I just thought the juxtaposition of the smiley faces with masked troops was so startling and really made you think, like it raises lots of different feelings — this is clearly not a happy moment,” Gibson said.
Ross commented on the paradoxical nature of Banksy’s art, which opposes capitalism while selling for millions of dollars.
“I think the irony on irony of it is, when you go through this exhibit and you think about Banksy, who's had this incredible anti-commercial message, there is like $40 million that he's sold upstairs. So he is one of the wealthiest anti-commercialists in the world, and so part of the irony is to see that,” Ross said.
“The Art of Banksy” announced on Feb. 14 that it will be extending its stay from the original end date of April 3 to May 15 due to popular demand. After attending the preview, Zagami recommends visiting the show for a date night or just for something fun to do.
“It's something that you're not going to see all the time, and I think people need to step out of their comfort zones a little bit and take an adventure and…explore. And you learn a lot in the way,” Zagami said. “I just think people should take a risk. Come out. I love it.”

You can read the quality of food at a Chinese restaurant by the quality of its bathroom. Every stunning bathroom may indeed bring with it a dinner of mediocre takes on Chinese classics.
Escaping the simultaneously colorful yet dimly lit and overwhelmingly decorated seating area in Harvard Square’s newest restaurant and bar, Wusong Road, one may find refuge in the bathroom, taking time to admire the pristine, patterned tiles on the floor and the playful wallpaper of monkeys drinking vodka. Some sort of arbitrary house music plays above, and a large window tints the bathroom with the purple-blue of nightfall. But despite its spick-and-span bathroom, flashy decor, and beautiful cocktails, Wusong Road’s food failed to dazzle — it was a confusing disappointment. To the dismay of students across campus, the restaurant reaffirms the fear that good Chinese food in Harvard Square remains a faraway pipe dream.
For some Asian American students, their new college environment means leaving behind the endless stretches of strip malls where Mexican, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, or Korean restaurants serve as safe havens and meeting spots for immigrants and refugees who long for the tastes and smells and textures of home. After reading about the opening of Wusong Road last semester, one ought to have been intrigued by the chef owner, Jason Doo, a child of Chinese restaurant owners in Malden, MA. Some Cambridge and Boston foodies, however, remained skeptical after hearing announcements about a Tiki bar, let alone a Chinese restaurant and Tiki bar all-in-one.
At their 5:00 p.m. opening on a weekday, hosts at the new establishment welcomed in a crowd of punctual customers eager to decide for themselves what all the buzz was about. Within a few disorienting minutes, the atmosphere was filled with a shared sense of confusion among customers: was this Asian fusion? Chinese-Hawaiian? 1950s Tiki exotica? On the second floor, which houses the Tiki bar and sit-down restaurant, one is met with a mish-mash of embellishments displaying Chinese and Hawaiian iconography.
Up for tasting were the Spam and Egg Musubi, Madam Wu’s Salad, and the Dan Dan Ragu, each dish popular Hawaiian and American Chinese culinary classics. To my dismay, each dish lacked distinct, comforting flavors and proved rather unfulfilling. Spam Musubi, a popular snack in Hawa’ii with heavy influence from Japanese presence on the archipelago, is an easy home favorite. To one’s surprise, Wusong Road’s Spam and Egg Musubi did not resemble the staple snack, replacing the familiar notes of umami with a lack of flavor and odd textures that also characterized the Dan Dan Ragu.
More on the Dan Dan Ragu: dàndàn miàn (担担面) is a popular Sichuan noodle dish found in many forms, with different families, restaurants, and communities putting their own spin on the flour noodles drenched in creamy, spicy sauce. Often, the dish is garnished with peanuts, minced pork, and Sichuan chili oil. Wusong Road’s attempt at everyday American Chinese failed to satisfy, serving instead a dry and sauceless heap of noodles with chunks of pork at the bottom of the bowl. The magical sounds and aromas of creamy, spicy noodles from traditional and beloved Chinese cafes failed to appear in this Wusong Road version, reaffirming their marked divergence from traditional Chinese cuisine.
Perhaps most indicative of the experience is Madam Wu’s salad, which promised a zesty blend of crispy wontons, edamame, onions, carrots, scallions, and mandarin-orange vinaigrette, but arrived soggy and akin to an American side salad. A lot of flare, but not a lot of substance.
While Wusong Road’s attempt at American Chinese has potential for improvement with the addition of more traditional species and techniques, one may find themselves still wishing for tasty, affordable, accessible Chinese food (besides Dumpling House) at the end of the day. Wusong Road’s food and interior photographs beautifully, but Harvard Square’s newest establishment did not provide the fulfilling gastronomic experience one could have hoped for. After such an adventure gone awry, one can at least leave with good bathroom selfies.
Stay tuned next week for the second installment of my Wusong Road review, diving into the cultural politics behind the restaurant’s concept and hype.

Old money, green ivy. Such is Greenwich Park, the posh London neighborhood in which award-winning journalist Katherine Faulkner’s debut novel is set. In this thriller, dirty secrets shatter the idyllic lives of some of London’s wealthiest residents. “Greenwich Park” takes a while to get going, but when it finally does, it is a suspenseful read with a story that blends beautifully into its setting.
The novel begins with a mysterious letter sent from prison to Helen, who is soon revealed to be the story’s protagonist. Helen is the daughter of a famous architect, lives with her husband in her expansive childhood home on the edge of Greenwich Park, and is twenty-four weeks pregnant with their first child. Her life seems perfect — until, well, it isn’t.
As the book — and Helen’s pregnancy — progresses, her life slowly unravels. In the first 150 pages of the novel, strange and foreboding signs bring themselves, one by one, to the doorstep of her perfect home. She starts to receive strange and insistent calls from lenders about a mortgage she and her husband never took out. A strange photo from their past, though torn and discarded long ago, somehow makes its way into a box of her husband’s valuables.
And then, of course, there is Rachel, the boisterous friend whom Helen meets at her prenatal classes. Rachel seems to have little sense of self-awareness and even less regard for rules and manners. She sticks out like a sore thumb in Greenwich Park, and yet her presence begins to take over Helen’s life in an off-putting way.
The 150 pages of exposition in which Faulkner develops the characters of Helen and Rachel are crucial to the novel’s exhilarating ending. Unfortunately, they are also a bit slow. Faulkner attempts to hold readers’ attention by interspersing episodes of a dark and mysterious character throughout Helen’s first-person narration, but the stakes in this section of the book are simply not high enough. It is easy to lose sight of the drama that this exposition is meant to set up, and Faulkner risks losing the attention of some readers.
For those that make it through, however, there is ample reward. About halfway through her book, Faulkner picks up the pace, and “Greenwich Park” becomes much more interesting. Faulkner creates a great deal of suspense by narrating the story from three different points of view. She switches rapidly between concurrent story lines told from the eyes of Helen, her sister-in-law Serena, and her friend Katie. Short chapters make the writing snappy and keep readers on edge as one storyline is broken off to reveal stunning details from the next. The end result is a verifiable page-turner that will have readers racing to its conclusion.
Faulkner’s strengths, however, do not lie only in her brilliant pacing. She is also a wonderfully descriptive writer, and she successfully leverages this ability to infuse her novel with short descriptive passages that punch well above their weight. Her beautiful writing even allows her to use the setting of her novel to make its conclusion that much more tragic. “Greenwich Park” is aptly named, reflecting both the novel’s elitist backdrop and one of its most potent symbols.
All in all, “Greenwich Park” is worth reading past its sluggish first half. Though the novel’s slower moments may not have readers on edge, they lay the groundwork for what is a truly thrilling conclusion, one that will keep readers’ eyes locked on the page. Faulkner may not be fast out of the blocks, but she sure finishes strong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 27, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce the 2022 Oscar winners. The favorite, Jane Campion’s “The Power of the Dog,” leads the fray with 12 nominations, followed closely by 10 nominations for Denis Villenueve’s “Dune,” which is predicted to dominate the design categories.
Best Picture
2022 might well be the year Netflix finally snatches the Best Picture category for “The Power of the Dog,” a strong contender ever since its successful Venice Film Festival debut. Jane Campion’s seemingly unassuming Western story is a refreshing take on the genre that cuts into the emotions of its protagonists with surgical precision. The methodical buildup of tension as the film explores the troubled psyches exposed by the conflict between Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his brother’s (Jesse Plemons) new family makes for a strikingly powerful psychological drama, on some level reminiscent of the contemplative, slowly-paced “Nomadland.”
The film, however, is by no means a shoe-in. If Campion were to follow in Chloé Zhao’s footsteps, “The Power of the Dog” would first have to beat a strong competitor in Kenneth Branagh’s “Belfast.” Both titles have already garnered a slew of nominations, with recognition from both the BAFTAs and Critics’ Choice Awards. “Belfast” might have had the upper hand at the Toronto International Film Festival, snagging the People’s Choice Award, but ultimately it is “The Power of the Dog” that prevailed at the Golden Globes with a total of three awards, including for Best Drama against “Belfast”’s sole one for best screenplay. More importantly, Branagh’s picture got snubbed in the Best Editing category, a nomination that has historically been strongly correlated with the Best Picture award.
Best Director
Only two women have ever won in the Best Director category: Katheryn Bigelow in 2010 for “The Hurt Locker” and Chloé Zhao in 2021 for “Nomadland.” Jane Campion had a chance to join the exclusive group back in 1993, when she was nominated for “The Piano,” but she ultimately lost to Steven Spielberg. This year’s rematch between Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) and Steven Spielberg (“West Side Story”) is likely to go the other way around — in the past 20 years, there has not been a single time that a person not nominated for a BAFTA has won the Oscar for Best Director, and Spielberg got snubbed by the British Academy. Indeed it might be worth looking to Britain in search of Campion’s main competitor: Kenneth Branagh could once again give the New Zealand director a run for her money, but the award seems Campion’s to lose, especially in light of her Golden Globe.
Best Actor
Will Smith has already generated Oscar buzz after “King Richard”’s Sept. 2021 premiere at the Telluride Film Festival.“Will Smith is gonna win that Oscar,” Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson stated. Smith seems to be, quite literally, the safe bet, with gambling websites such as Oddschecker showing him as having the highest odds. And the performance more than warrants it. Smith skillfully portrays Richard Williams’s vulnerabilities and wounds, turning what could be an unremarkable success story into a deeply touching, engrossing family drama.
If third time’s the charm, Smith could finally get the Best Actor award after his nominations in 2002 for “Ali” and in 2007 for “The Pursuit of Happyness.” Notwithstanding, Campion’s picture is not to be overlooked. Benedict Cumberbatch, the only Oscar nominee other than Smith recognized by BAFTA, certainly remains a contender with his role as the hyper-masculine cattle rancher Phil Burbank.
Best Actress
When Kristen Stewart, lauded as “the crowned queen of awards season,” appeared on the cover of Entertainment Weekly back in October, her victory seemed a foregone conclusion, and for good reason: Stewart’s seamless transitions from bouts of madness to scenes of motherly love in “Spencer” were stunning. But Nicole Kidman’s surprise Golden Globe victory over Stewart for her role as Lucille Ball in “Being the Ricardos” means she might have a shot at adding another Oscar to her long list of accolades.
Best Supporting Actor
With nominations for two BAFTAs (Rising Star in addition to Best Actor in a Supporting Role), SAG and Critics’ Choice awards as well as a Golden Globe victory, “The Power of the Dog”’s Kodi Smit-McPhee seems well-positioned to get the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. There is, however, a potential obstacle in his way: age. If the 25-year-old prevails, he will be the second youngest winner in the category (Tony Hutton, at 20, was the youngest to receive the award for “Ordinary People” in 1980). If he doesn’t, there’s a chance for “Coda”’s Tony Kotsur to become the first deaf man to win an acting award.
Best Supporting Actress
Despite some formidable competition in the form of Aunjanue Ellis (“King Richard”) and Kirsten Dunst (“The Power of the Dog”), Ariana DeBose of “West Side Story” seems favored to win, especially after she defeated the two at the Golden Globes. And if she adds an Oscar to the Golden Globe for her role as Anita to the list of her accolades, she will make history, becoming only the fourth Latina to win an Academy Award in an acting category. Coincidentally, the first to do so was Rita Moreno, who 60 years earlier played the very same role in the 1961 version of “West Side Story.”
Best Original Screenplay
The story of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Licorice Pizza” is genius, embodying the comedy-drama genre by mixing romance, humorous misadventures, and business endeavors with heartbreak and family struggles. With its slew of nominations, it’s a strong contender in the category. But it will have to fight tooth and nail against Branagh’s Golden Globe-winning “Belfast,” whose evocative story rich with sharp juxtapositions brilliantly depicts the experience of the Irish Troubles through a child’s eyes.
Best Adapted Screenplay
The Academy seems to love surprising audiences with its Best Adapted Screenplay award, and the category has seen its fair share of underdogs. Last year, the statue went to the otherwise-snubbed “Promising Young Woman.” The 2019 win of “JoJo Rabbit” was seen as a huge upset. And so, while “The Power of the Dog”’s Jane Campion is favored to win her second Oscar in the category, Japan’s “Drive My Car,” a deeply touching dive into grief and guilt, might well snatch the award.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Born and raised in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, Alana Haim is a Valley girl. “Through and through,” she said in a roundtable interview with The Harvard Crimson on Jan. 24. The critically acclaimed musician, known primarily for her role as guitarist and vocalist in the band Haim, was discussing her acting debut in Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest effort. The character she plays in the Oscar-nominated, nostalgia-driven love letter to the ’70s that is “Licorice Pizza,” is also a valley girl. Where Alana Kane (her character's name in the film) is “a little crazy” and “a little frantic,” Haim is less so, she assures. Both Alanas, though, are ride-or-dies for their loved ones. “She's very protective over the people that she cares about. I definitely can see myself in that aspect,” Haim said.
The film follows Alana, 25 years old and frustrated with her dead-end job, and Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), an entrepreneurial 15-year old who, from the moment he sees Alana taking class pictures at his high school, becomes wholly fixated on her. He chases her and traps her in (at first) unwelcome flirtations at every opportunity. What ensues is a saccharine romp through Anderson’s vision of a Los Angeles overflowing with quirky celebrities, romantic lighting, and braless women. “We basically lived in the ’70s all the time,” Haim said of filming on a set kept pure of modern technology like cellphones. “It was all very much like we were living in that time.”
Amid the collage of incongruous vignettes of Gary and Alana’s adventures that drive the film, Haim’s performance soars. Save for a few stints as the Wicked Witch of the West in school productions, “Licorice Pizza” is Haim’s acting debut — and a stellar one at that. The New York Times has cited her “expressive range” as crucial to the film’s success. In a review of the film, The Crimson praised her “magnetic screen presence” — the true mark of a performer. In a film saturated with self-referential nods to its auteur, Haim’s character (in spite of the overdone Valley Dream Girl mold Anderson set up for her) is both a point of light, and a breath of fresh air. Her performance is honest and generous. “I just got to, you know, dive into this deep end and kind of immerse myself in this process and just try to do my best,” Haim said of filming her now-celebrated debut, before adding, “I couldn't have done it without [Paul].”
Still, Haim is better known for what she does on stage than on screen. For over a decade, she’s been guitarist and vocalist for the band she shares with her older sisters Este and Danielle. Like the band (also named Haim), “Licorice Pizza” is a family affair. Haim is joined on screen by her sisters and parents, all of them taking on roles as part of the Kane family. “For the longest time it kind of felt like this weird, family vacation movie that we all kind of made. But I never really thought anyone was gonna see it,” Haim said of the film and its many connections to her real life, the life that Anderson was inspired by. “Now people can see it, and they like it? It's an honor.”
It was through her band with her sisters, too, that Haim first got to work with Anderson. He directed the band’s music videos for “Summer Girl,” “The Steps,” “Valentine,” and other songs — all of them on film (“Paul is all film, everyday”). Just this week, the “Licorice Pizza” official Twitter account announced a new Anderson-directed Haim music video, titled “Lost Track,” which will play in theaters before every screening. “I did feel like I kind of had a cheat sheet, being with him on music videos,” Haim said.
The working relationship between the musician and director began when, nearly 10 years before “Licorice Pizza,” Anderson emailed Haim asking to direct their videos. They agreed. He had no idea at the time that the band’s mother had been his art teacher in grade school.
That type of spontaneous relationship is what Haim sees at the heart of Alana and Gary’s story: “You never know who's gonna come back into your life, stay in your life. And I think that's very much what happened in 'Licorice Pizza,’” she said of the film . “Alana [Kane] could have met Gary and it could have been a five minute conversation and they never see each other again, and their lives go [on], whatever. And really,… they don't know it yet, but their lives are forever changed and they go on these crazy adventures.”
As with any gauzy ’70s film, it's the soundtrack to these crazy adventures that pushes the story forward. Songs like The Doors’ 1970 funk-filled psychedelic track “Peace Frog,” David Bowie’s iconic “Life on Mars?” and “The July Tree,” a heart wrenchingly bluesy ballad by Nina Simone, plant audiences squarely in the decade of love, bell bottoms, and, for Alana and Gary, water beds. “The songs that are in 'Licorice Pizza' are all songs that I love so much,” Haim said. “When [Paul McCartney and Wings’] 'Let Me Roll It' plays, it's one of my favorite songs of all time…. The first really big part of the movie is when that song plays, and it was an honor.”
Indeed, the music of the film is also its life force — a skilled exercise in scene setting that allows the film to explore its many intersecting plot lines without getting bogged down in the weeds of world building. According to Haim, music also played a big role in keeping the actors themselves immersed in the upbeat energy of the film. “Music was constantly playing [on set], and it plays a huge part because it kept the vibe going,” she said. “[It] kind of reminded me of being on music videos, like it really did keep the vibe high.” And Alana Kane’s musical mantra? “So much Freda Payne. Every morning, Freda Payne 'Band of Gold.'”
Alana Haim doesn’t know yet whether or not she’ll keep acting, but it seems a career will be waiting for her if she does. “I haven't really thought about the future. I'm going on tour, so that's pretty much the next thing that I'm thinking about,” she said. Haim’s world tour starts late April and will run through the summer, keeping the newly-minted acting family busy for the next few months.
“I hope I can act again. That would be really sick,” Haim said, before adding, “If I don’t, and this is it, this was the best experience I could ever dream of.”

In one of Meta’s first video ads after rebranding from Facebook, four people in an art gallery fixate on a painting of a tiger killing a buffalo. The buffalo is subdued: caps to the grass, it bows in deference to its predator. The tiger’s narrow pupils move to regard its viewers. In the next shot, the tiger’s tail starts wagging and the long grass rustles — the painting comes to life. The four spectators are immersed in the surrounding jungle as it gains an extra dimension, full of dancing rainforest animals. Friends and foes, prey and predator all dance together to a stuttering house beat, all creeds and colors, et cetera, ad nauseam. It’s a mind-numbingly meaningless commercial, more creepy in tone than convincing in messaging. In fact, the only text appears at the end of the ad, laid over the faces of the tiger and the buffalo, bopping together now in mechanical coexistence. It reads, “This is going to be fun.” Under the white letters, the two beasts shoot each other furtive glances.
From this ad, it’s hard to draw assumptions about the hyped-up Metaverse, defined by Oxford Languages as “a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.” Championed by Mark Zuckerberg himself as “the next chapter for the Internet,” the Metaverse is touted by its many Silicon Valley supporters as an opportunity for engaging social and material interaction in a reality-simulating 3-D space, to the end of revolutionizing human connection. Coincidentally, Zuckerberg used similar verbiage before Congress during Facebook’s hearing regarding their alleged interference in the 2016 election.
It’s worth noting that the current conception of the Metaverse is still a fantasy, not yet realized beyond small-scale demos and advertisements. The degree of corporate collaboration necessary to engineer such an immersive, continuous world is not yet here. And yet, the world’s biggest tech corporations are doing the unthinkable — collaborating — in pursuit of this shared vision. The onset of the Metaverse, in this context, feels inevitable — out of the hands of the general public but still championed by entrepreneurs and massive corporations like its technological predecessor, the Internet. But while the early proponents of the Internet sought to revolutionize humankind’s interaction with information, the Metaverse takes a step further, daring to upheave humankind’s interaction with their spatial environment and, more ambitiously, with each other.
The historical relationship between technological advances like the onset of the Metaverse and public opinion seems to be characterized by initial resistance, followed by eventual acquiescence. Plenty of consumers had their doubts about the Internet in its early days, and now its ubiquitous influence is essential to the day-to-day life of most of America. A pattern begins to emerge here: Silicon Valley tech giants make decisions for the general public, who, without fail, initially protest, then accept the new wave of the tech revolution with stifled gratitude.
This trend is the genius of big corporate tech in the age of information — a persuasive shroud of benevolence veils a well-oiled profiteering machine. Critics of “technological improvement” are immediately shot down as ungrateful — biting the hand that feeds them their newest smartphone or fastest delivery app. Human identity is, by consequence, sucked bit by bit into a system that itemizes and monetizes social interaction. Zuckerberg’s promise for the Metaverse is a system that serves the complex and sensorial needs of a whole person. In reality, Zuckerberg’s Metaverse could manifest itself in a dangerously tidy second world, where everything from protest to the natural environment to personal identity could be profit-based.
Meta’s advertisement featuring dancing jungle animals is especially unnerving in this context; nature, out in the real world, seems to be the only thing the Metaverse cannot recreate. Perhaps the corporation is compensating in advance, co-opting a jungle’s vibrant, uncurated nature to market what will likely be a meticulously curated second world.
Maybe Meta’s jungle ad is a work of evil genius. As the permafrost melts and the seas rise, it’s a nice image to return to: Flamingoes grooving, snakes gyrating, only accessible through a $300 Oculus VR headset. It succeeds in insisting on the fun of the metaverse, no matter the cost. Among the buzzwords and flashy, specially curated startup colors, it’s easy to forget that Meta and its collaborators may have self-serving, ulterior motives in developing this second world.

Last Thursday, Feb. 9, Nintendo aired their first Nintendo Direct of the year. The 40-minute pre-recorded news presentation featured a variety of announcements focused on games coming to the Nintendo Switch in the first half of 2022.
The Direct opened with the announcement of “Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes,” a spin-off of “Fire Emblem: Three Houses” and the second entry in the “Fire Emblem Warriors” subseries. In contrast to the signature strategic turn-based gameplay of “Fire Emblem,” the “Fire Emblem Warriors” subseries focuses on hack-and-slash action combat. “Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes” is set to launch on June 24.
An announcement for “Mario Strikers: Battle League” followed. The third entry in the “Mario Strikers” series, “Mario Strikers: Battle League” will have Mario and his friends competing in chaotic Mushroom Kingdom soccer for the first time since 2007. The game launches on June 10. Another sports game came in the form of “Nintendo Switch Sports,” the sequel to “Wii Sports,” which will launch on April 29, with a free update in the fall adding in the ability to play golf.
The Direct ended with the announcement of the action RPG “Xenoblade Chronicles 3.” While little information is available at this time, the game’s story is set to combine the worlds of “Xenoblade Chronicles” and “Xenoblade Chronicles 2.” This new entry in Nintendo’s growing franchise is set in the conflict-torn land of Aionios, where the countries of Keeves and Agnus are at war. The central theme of the game, launching this September, will be the sanctity of life.
The Direct also revealed additional information about some games already known to be in development. A trailer for “Kirby and the Forgotten Land,” launching March 25, showed Mouthful Mode, a new gameplay mechanic with which Kirby can transform into and control objects such as cars by inhaling them. Likewise, the presentation announced that the Salmon Run co-op mode from “Splatoon 2” will return in “Splatoon 3,” coming this summer.
Nintendo capitalized on the success of “Mario Kart 8 Deluxe” — the best-selling game on the Switch, which nearly half of the playerbase owns — by revealing the Booster Course Pass, which will add 48 race tracks taken from throughout the “Mario Kart” series to “Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,” doubling the game’s course list. This paid DLC will come in six waves of eight courses each, finishing by the end of 2023. The first wave arrives on March 18.
The Direct also covered a wide variety of ports and remakes — some of which were entirely unexpected. “Assassin’s Creed: The Ezio Collection” comes to the Switch on Feb. 17, and the “Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece for Cloud” bundle, spanning almost the entire “Kingdom Hearts” series so far, launched for the Switch on Feb. 10. It is, however, only a cloud version, meaning that players are not so much playing the game as streaming it from a cloud service, and one which is prone to stability issues). Similarly, the “Portal: Companion Collection” is bringing “Portal” and “Portal 2” to the Switch later this year, and “No Man’s Sky” is coming to the console this summer. Finally, the cult-classics “EarthBound Beginnings” and its sequel “EarthBound” have been added to Nintendo Switch Online.
Remasters featured in the presentation included “Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition,” launching on April 7. In addition to “Chrono Cross,” it includes “Radical Dreamers,” a visual novel adventure side story to “Chrono Trigger” — to which “Chrono Cross” is a sequel — that is receiving an official translation for the first time. Additionally, “Klonoa Phantasy Reverie Series” is bringing remasters of “Klonoa: Door to Phantomile” and “Klonoa 2: Lunatea’s Veil” to the Switch, reviving the series after its long dormancy. The collection is coming July 8.
In terms of remakes, the “Advance Wars” strategy RPG series is returning in “Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp” on April 8. Another strategy RPG is getting a second chance in “Front Mission 1st: Remake,” launching this summer, with a confirmation of “Front Mission 2: Remake” coming to the Switch sometime in the future. Notably, the cult-classic RPG “Live A Live,” which has never before been released outside Japan, is receiving a remake in the HD-2D art style on July 22.
This Nintendo Direct expanded on popular franchises while giving lesser-known games a second chance at life, and made for a particularly exciting day for fans of the RPG genre.

Yesterday, I watched a shapely female penguin tell me all the ways one could turn her on.
Yes, I was watching “Happy Feet.”
Despite the strange sexual tension that pervades most of the movie, George Miller’s 2006 award-winning animated film remains a children’s winter classic garnering both critical and public acclaim upon release. For those unfamiliar with this childhood staple: “Happy Feet” follows the story of tap-dancing Emperor penguin Mumble (Elijah Wood), whose inability to sing like the rest of his colony prevents him from finding a mate. As Mumble grows up, he must save his colony from the mysterious “alien” force that threatens the penguins’ vital fish source: humans.
After my first encounter with the movie at 11 years old, I remember feeling inexplicably and fundamentally disturbed, a response not shared by my peers. There was something sinister, something not quite right about “Happy Feet.” It’s only after re-watching the film seven years later that I can see just how weird and unsettling this childhood favorite truly is. Saturated with sexual content, semi-dystopian in nature, and downright chilling in its ability to dehumanize viewers, “Happy Feet” should have found its niche not in children’s cinema but in adult horror.
From the start, “Happy Feet” makes the questionable decision to frame penguin mating through a surprisingly explicit process where two penguins sing mature pop songs to each other in order to find the most compatible musical, and thus life partner. Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman), Mumble’s mother begins the movie with a breathy, seductive rendition of Prince’s “Kiss” and croons “I just need your body, baby / From dusk ‘til dawn.” Granted, the sexual undertones of the lyrics may go over the heads of a younger audience, especially when the tunes themselves are so catchy. Nevertheless, the song choices throughout the film feel distinctly inappropriate for a movie so clearly marketed towards younger viewers.
I’m willing to overlook the musical repertoire — half the movie is, after all, about mating — if it weren’t for the alarmingly frequent depictions of the penguins’ unrestrained sex drives. It’s almost gratuitous how many times Norma Jean calls her mate Memphis “daddy.” Even harder to believe is when Mumble drums on his friend Gloria’s feathery bottom before the two grind against each other during a dance sequence. Or that a shaman-esque penguin called Lovelace, surrounded by a flock of eager-to-please female penguins, shouts “Make that little noise again, girl!” as he enters his tent with his groupies. This thinly-veiled sexual energy is supplemented by a strict oligarchy of elders requiring complete adherence to its rules and an opposing cadre of radical, racialized penguins (the “Amigos”) who offer Mumble a second home unlike his own. With characters who can barely contain their raging libidos and an oversimplified rally against the institution, “Happy Feet” may very well be the next successful YA dystopian franchise.
But these disparate elements cut strange (and certainly not scary) only in retrospect and through adulthood reflection. The true culprit of the sheer horror I felt as a child watching the movie is something intrinsic to the way George Miller shoots and animates his film. Frequent wide-angle shots of the moody Antarctic landscape and the chaotic mass of penguin bodies along with abrupt zoom-outs and the dizzying roving of the camera create an unnerving feeling of uprootedness in the viewer. Through baby Mumble’s eyes, everything and everyone becomes immense and terrifying, including predators and aggressive adults like the Russian primadonna penguin who tries to teach Mumble to sing, the mafia-bro Skua birds that almost spear Mumble alive, and the sharp-toothed killer whales and seals that nearly devour him whole. It’s easy to feel small and unsafe while watching “Happy Feet” because the possibility of Mumble’s gruesome death hangs ominously over every scene. By experiencing the world not with, but through Mumble, my young human self lost her place at the top of the food chain and instead occupied the vulnerable position of a young penguin and of prey — a dehumanizing loss-of-power technique commonly employed in monster movies like “Godzilla” or “Jurassic Park.”
By the end of the film, I realized that “Happy Feet” takes this dehumanized prey complex one chilling step further. What’s simultaneously disturbing and powerful about the movie is that unlike other monster horror films, it doesn’t introduce a new top predator to the food chain to oppose humankind. There’s no supernatural or inhuman beast that wrongfully usurps human power. Instead, “Happy Feet” strips the audience of its humanity by forcing viewers into Mumble’s mind and body, so much so that when humans do appear in the zoo scene at the end of the film, they seem voyeuristic, unnatural, even alien. It’s at this moment that, after an hour and a half of being forced to adopt pseudo-penguin consciousness, the movie forcefully reminds the viewer that she was once, and is still in fact, human. But humanity, and the power that comes with it — a power the audience associates with the movie’s antagonists — no longer feels appropriate or wanted. Humanity feels monstrous. And what more fitting horror trope is there than the recognition that the true monster lives inside of you?

Ocean Vuong’s second poetry collection “Time Is a Mother” explores how the passage of time shapes the intimacy of human relationships. At once mournful and celebratory, the collection echoes his past work in its fixation with time. Here, he explores its shifting features — how it is at once violent and protective, effacing and preserving. Poems in the collection such as “Almost Human” and “Not Even,” recall his breakthrough poem “Someday I’ll Love Ocean Vuong” in the speakers’ interior dialogue with themselves. The prosaic “Nothing” and “Künstlerroman,” filled with ordinary landscapes vitalized by a longing for intimacy, are reminiscent of his sensational debut novel “On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous.” Yet Vuong’s writing has also matured. Moments of eruptive joy fragment the wistfulness and melancholy that define his landscapes. Honoring the persistence of grief, Vuong also holds fast to the conviction that something must exist beyond it. Ultimately, “Time Is a Mother” at once preserves and expands the poignant verse readers have come to expect of Vuong.
For Vuong, intimacy and distance are often flipsides of the same coin. Someone with whom he has shared a myriad of experiences swiftly turns inscrutable, and another who has for years been a stranger becomes, in a sudden turn of events, achingly close. Though he draws inspiration from his own lived experiences, the sensation he describes comes across as universal. In “American Legend,” a car accident literally makes two emotionally distant people collide in a startling moment of communion: “I wanted, at last, to feel him / against me—& / it worked.” Vuong continues, “he slammed / into me & / we hugged / for the first time / in decades. It was perfect / & wrong, like money / on fire.”
Indeed, it is in these moments of quiet and electrifying transgression that Vuong’s collection shines. In his prose poem “Nothing,” Vuong’s speaker recalls shoveling snow with a significant other. Precise descriptions of the ethereal landscape brush shoulders against devastating assertions delivered in a jarringly neutral tone: “It’s so quiet every flake on my coat has a life. I used to cry in a genre no one read.” Later, Vuong gives voice to the elusiveness and the paradox of human connection. His description of the expansive multitudes of a single person is markedly Whitmanian: “There is so much room in a person there should be more of us in here. Traveler who is inches away but never here, are you warm where you are?”
Arguably the most memorable poem is the last one in the entire collection, “Woodworking at the End of the World.” Its introduction is faithful to the understated, piercing drama that has come to characterize Vuong’s verse: “In a field, after everything, a streetlamp / shining on a patch of grass. / Having just come to life, I lay down under its warmth / & waited for a way.” In the poem, the speaker meets a boy, presumably their younger self. The brief exchange Vuong has with the boy at the end of the world is mythic, verging on a parable: “he kissed me as if returning a porcelain shard / to my cheek. / Shaking, I turned to him. I turned / & found, crumpled on the grass, the faded red shirt.” The boy, like so many of the other people that populate Vuong’s pages, is at once estranged and intimate, inscrutable and strikingly familiar. His simple yet gorgeous language illuminates the enduring bond between the speaker and the boy, building toward an apt climax for both the poem and the collection at large.
Ultimately, Vuong’s newest collection is, quite literally, full of fear. Different fears mingle, coalesce: a fear of loss. A fear of estrangement and, at times, a fear of closeness — or at least the interior truths that closeness reveals about ourselves. A fear of connections that dissipate before they have the opportunity to begin. The lines that cinch “Time Is a Mother” are delivered in a moment of revelatory catharsis: “Then it came to me, my life. & I remembered my life / the way an ax handle, mid-swing, remembers the tree. / & I was free.” The finale of Vuong’s sprawling poetic vision is at once dangerous and peaceful, elegiac and triumphant. Vuong’s text pulses with an attentiveness to fear. It is through this emotion that he renders such luminous meditations on his life, and of the people who have come to change it. Vuong fears, which is to say, he refuses to not love.

This review contains spoilers for Season One of “The Book of Boba Fett” and Season Two of “The Mandalorian.”
The Book of… who now?
With the conclusion of the second season of “The Mandalorian” in Dec. 2020, viewers were made aware that a spin-off series starring one of “Star Wars”’s most popular characters, Boba Fett, was in the works at Disney+. Long thought to have been killed in 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” the broody bounty hunter made a triumphant return to the screen nearly 40 years later in “The Mandalorian.” Given the massive popularity of “The Mandalorian” and Boba Fett’s status as a pop culture icon, it seemed like a natural move for Disney and Lucasfilm to expand on Boba’s story. Despite the character’s popularity, though, many forget that he only ever had roughly five minutes of screentime in the original “Star Wars” trilogy, so this was also a prime opportunity to pair his cultural prowess with an appropriately powerful narrative. It’s ultimately disappointing, then, to see that this narrative falls far short of what it could have been, and to realize that this didn’t only happen by chance — rather, it was a creative choice. “The Book of Boba Fett” opts to function as a mere vehicle for the overarching trajectory of “The Mandalorian,” and the byproduct is a series that contains a few excellent episodes but tells a story that ultimately feels incomplete.
“The Book of Boba Fett” aims to simultaneously tackle two timelines: one that catches us up with everything that happened to Boba since “Return of the Jedi” and one that continues his story following season two of “The Mandalorian.” In this later timeline, he assumes the throne of Mos Espa on the planet Tatooine, a role once held by ruthless crime lord Jabba the Hutt. The show’s split-timeline structure never quite finds its groove, though, as there’s no apparent pattern for the amount of focus each timeline receives in a given episode, and this imbalance makes the timelines feel a bit disjointed. This weakness might also be seen as an ironic microcosm for the show as a whole, in the sense that the balance of its overall story is disturbed by Chapters 5 and 6. In any case, the show’s earlier timeline consistently proves to be more intriguing, as it immediately confronts the most pressing question raised by Boba’s return: How exactly did he escape the Sarlacc, the slimy sandworm that supposedly killed him? The sequence that gives us the answer is at once a wonderful expansion of classic “Star Wars” lore and a triumph of visual effects portraying the gory guts of the Sarlacc in ways that were unimaginable in 1983. And, most importantly, it’s a sequence that initiates Boba’s reformative transition from cold-blooded killer to respectful ruler.
Boba’s character is handled best amid his journey of recovery in the earlier timeline. Though he doesn’t speak the language of the Tusken Raiders, the desert-dwelling tribe that takes him in, Boba evidently experiences a slow-burn assimilation to their way of life beneath the blistering twin suns of Tatooine. Temuera Morrison, who originally played the role of Jango Fett in 2002’s “Attack of the Clones,” makes a masterful transition to becoming Jango’s son, as Boba’s ever-pensive demeanor particularly shines in sequences with the Tusken Raiders that feature little dialogue. The penchant for trust and belonging instilled in him by the Tuskens clearly influences his perspective in the main timeline, as he emphasizes the following to his companion, Fennec Shand: “Jabba ruled with fear. I intend to rule with respect.”
Unfortunately, the main timeline’s directionless plot doesn’t give Boba anything meaningful to do with this newfound development. From Chapters 1 to 4, Boba largely just strolls through the streets of Mos Espa and confronts issues that feel unthreatening from a narrative standpoint, while the implied main conflict involves the unsanctioned operations of a crime syndicate — the Pykes — but no clear central villain. This messiness only devolves further in Chapter 5, when Boba’s story is utterly relegated to the background. Oh, and something else about Chapter 5? It’s the best one in the series.
“Chapter 5: Return of the Mandalorian” does exactly what its title suggests, showcasing the chrome-plated, fan-favorite character last seen in the season two finale of his own series. This standout chapter offers a satisfying mix of action-packed bounty-hunting business and an interrogation of the feelings beneath Mando’s rarely-removed helmet. Pedro Pascal, who has donned Mando’s glistening armor since the character’s debut in 2019, continues to impress, given that his role requires him to work with nothing more than his voice and body language. His struggle in coping with his recent departure from his foundling son Grogu (better known as “Baby Yoda”) is the most gut-wrenching piece of storytelling “The Book of Boba Fett” has to offer, and it ironically has nothing to do with the series’ main character. This flaw only makes itself more obvious in Chapter 6, which, for much of its runtime, whisks us away to the gorgeous greenery of the planet on which Luke is training Grogu. In bringing back more fan-favorite characters and hitting on all the right story beats between master and apprentice, Chapter 6 makes it easy to forget that this series is even supposed to be about Boba Fett.
Chapter 6’s best attempt at salvaging the series’ story is its introduction of Cad Bane (Corey Burton), a bounty hunter made popular by the animated television series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars.” In revealing himself to be working with the Pykes, the volatile Bane indicates that he’d rather remain a hired gun than make a lifestyle change similar to Boba’s, and he finally provides the crime syndicate with a presence that feels significant. It likely would’ve done wonders for the series to have teased him in an earlier chapter, but Cad Bane’s transition to live-action is still executed well, as it’s incredible to once again encounter the threatening blood-red eyes and chilling growl of this dastardly space cowboy.
Ultimately, though Chapters 5 and 6 contain some of the series’ best individual storytelling, they also represent its most gaping narrative problem:These chapters serve the future of “The Mandalorian” well, but “The Book of Boba Fett” most definitely does not benefit from this critical departure from its story. The series finale does well to focus on the ideological conflicts and eventual face-off between Boba Fett and Cad Bane, but none of it feels fully deserved. Chapter 7 instead exemplifies the series’ overall tendency of being just a bit behind the ball in fleshing out everything it needs to, while its highlight is rather an action-packed team-up between Boba and Mando. The two characters’ jetpacks and shining suits of armor are glorious in tandem, but this unfortunately isn’t enough to rescue the series from its narrative dilemma.
In the end, it’s perhaps best to remember that Boba Fett was only on screen for a few short minutes in the original “Star Wars” trilogy, yet he still became nothing short of a cultural icon. It’s fittingly ironic, then, that the best parts of his own television series are the ones that barely feature him at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was warned, prior to embarking to the States, that Americans have poor English. While I appreciated such efforts to prime me for my experience in this country, I remained unfazed.
For one, poor grammar, especially in a language that has forced itself upon the world, can only be expected. In fact, embracing “poor grammar” is a mode of anti-colonial resistance that I applaud. But, upon my arrival in the land of liberty, I was stumped to find that the dominating language rebelled, not just against conventions of grammar, but against norms of punctuation – with one clause in particular. It was in the cosmopolitan confines of Cambridge that I encountered the “Hi, how are you?” that ends with a period, instead of a question mark.
It swiftly dawned on me that the city that I was to be courted by for the next four years of my life was one that did not know how to greet. Instead, I have been espoused by a city of sprinters, where we dash past others with such speed that people become mere meter-markers in the race to wherever we are off to next. In our ritual performance of city life — where eye contact is seemingly too intimate for the people we mumble “hi” to on our daily commute — I miss “Sawubona.”
I miss more than the cadence of the vowels, cradled by the warmth of the “buh” and elevated by the whispering “w.” I miss more than being immersed in the language from which it evolved — a language that I cannot speak nor adequately understand, but a tongue that I cannot divorce from the place I call home. Where I come from, in the clicking vernacular of the people of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, “hello” is not “hello.” In isiZulu, we greet with “Sawubona” — “We see you.” When we greet, we witness and profess, breathing soul into the hollow chambers of “hello.” I miss Sawubona. I miss being seen.
Remarkably, I have received some of the best greetings of my life in the short while that I have been in Massachusetts. However, most of these experiences have taken place at restaurants, cafes, and retail outlets, where smiles and “hellos” are attached to monetary values. It would be convenient for me to pawn off this flaw as characteristic American commercialism, and add it to my arsenal of reasons for criticizing the nation I now find myself a part of, a nation which I begrudge for all it possesses at the expense of places like my home. It would be easy to extend this observation and juxtapose it with the values of community that I have attached to
South Africa — a country with personality, a nation with charisma. While I could belabor my disdain for the capitalist failings of the United States, the issue of greeting (or the lack thereof) is not limited to America. In fact, my own dedication to the conventions of “Hi” and “How are you?” is a relatively recent development.
I began my commitment to greeting people out of compliance with my high school’s regulations. These rules, which stipulated the need to greet, legitimized a culture of acknowledgment. But this legitimacy was selective. I recall these regulations being virtually italicized with our interactions with the staff of the school — the teachers and the management personnel. But not the people in between. Not the caretakers, of which the majority in South Africa are poor; The people who traveled from far to maintain the equilibrium of well-trimmed suburbia for insupportable wages and even fewer thanks. This rule may have originated to enforce traditional dynamics of institutional respect. But the omission of some workers in institutionalized greeting culture had sinister collateral effects, even if they were accidental. By greeting along the socio-economic pecking order, we were pre-determining which people ought to be seen more than others.
What began as a daunting chore, motivated by the fear of retribution, became a commitment to seeing — acknowledging — everybody: cashiers at the supermarket, security guards, the workers at my high school.
And, here at Harvard, we should make an effort to greet the people in our entryway, strangers we sit with at Annenberg, and our classmates. But we must be most dedicated to greeting the people who are often glossed over as part of the red brick of this institution — HUDS staff, the workers milling about the yard during the day, the security guards who man the gates of the campus 24/7.
We live in an age where the rights of these workers, both in our institution and in the greater community, are at odds with a society co-opted by the dynamics of profit and capital. Thus, choosing to acknowledge all people becomes a political decision. The exploitation of these workers is sustained by the narrative that they are disposable. But narratives of expendability become void when we begin to perceive all people as people. “Sawubona” then, becomes not just the act of witnessing: It asserts itself, more importantly, as the refusal to ignore.
We greet to center the people who are eternally lodged in the peripheral – even if just for a moment.

The world plunged into isolation in 2020. What most people don’t realize, however, is that many disabled people are, have been, and will be in some form of isolation for their entire lives — and not the kind that protects them.
Forced solitude is a widespread problem among disabled people, one caused by ableism and the near-universal invisibility of our existence. Disabled people experience loneliness, low perceived social support, and isolation at significantly higher rates than those without disabilities. Whether disabled people are physically separated from others by inaccessible institutions or socially isolated within groups by hidden barriers of ableism, they’re pushed to the margins of their communities, into the shadows along the edges.
That’s where we spend our lives.
This pushing is a systemic action. A lesson I’ve learned when it comes to disability: If something can go wrong, it will. I’m talking about how my dad had to carry me up a flight of stairs to get me to my Harvard interview, about how my LSAT proctor only allowed me one of my five officially-approved accommodations. (I could write a whole column about my fun experiences.)
‘Murphy’s Law: Disabled Edition’ obviously isn’t an unbreakable rule, but it’s dishearteningly close to being one. That’s because it’s not a mere superstition; it’s a reflection of ableism so deeply entrenched into the fabric of society that we take it for granted. We’re all subconsciously trained to ignore it.
But when ableism occurs on a smaller scale, it’s no less devastating — rather, often even more so. Over time, gradually, one frustrating event turns into one hundred, until what seems minor comes to define my everyday life.
Disability creates social repercussions. When a club meeting is held in an inaccessible room; when someone shows me something on their phone, but the photo is too blurry for me to see, so I just nod and laugh; when people don’t consider inviting me to hang out because they assume I don’t do “normal person” activities, so that I always have to be the one to initiate plans if I want anything besides a meal in the dining hall to happen; repeatedly, over and over, every day, being with friends without being with them, being seen without being seen — that’s what social inaccessibility is. That’s what living in the shadows is.
It hurts.
Disability advocate Mia Mingus has coined a helpful term for this discussion: access intimacy. Access intimacy is a type of intimacy that occurs when someone “gets” your access needs, whether physical, mental, or sensory, no prompting required. It doesn’t mean that they’re successful in ensuring your needs are met, but it means that they try. Like platonic and romantic intimacy, access intimacy can develop over time. It signals that one’s basic needs for inclusion are being met, and it’s fundamentally impossible to build any meaningful relationship without it.
After a lifetime of feeling like a burden to my friends while watching my peers grow closer together without me, I’d know.
Access intimacy is when someone else looks out into the world and notices the ableism that permeates our lives, when they get angry at inaccessibility for us, when they momentarily live with us in our reality. It’s a feeling, a euphoric realization, that I can’t describe to anyone who hasn’t experienced it, except in these terms: If being disabled is living in the shadows, experiencing inclusion is finding a place in the sun.
This elation from access intimacy is made all the more powerful, unfortunately, by its scarcity. To think about others is such a simple action, and yet I often even have to remind friends that I can’t eat in inaccessible dining halls. It’s not that they think I can climb stairs (I use a walker), or that they forget I’m disabled (I use a walker), but that the problem doesn’t occur to them. Accessibility isn’t something we know to consider. And having to repeatedly remind others, to shoulder the weight of an inaccessible world alone, is draining. It makes me tired.
It’s no wonder that I get excited when someone proactively considers my accessibility needs, but I don’t think abled people understand the extent of that excitement. If someone shows even basic kindness, I’ll remember it photographically for years, long after they’ve forgotten it ever happened. This in itself is indicative of an issue: Disabled people go so unvalued, unappreciated, and unseen in society that we cling to anything we find, any validation of our meaning in the world. We’re conditioned to treat the bare minimum of consideration as revolutionary, to be overjoyed with eclipsed warmth while others stand under the sun.
So when the pandemic threw everyone into the shadows, I already knew how to exist in the dark. I’ll be stuck here long after everyone else leaves, too, searching for a place in the sun.
Living a disabled life means that the obstacles I face don’t end with my genetics. On the contrary, as much as my condition may hurt, the ableism I endure in social spheres always inflicts the deeper pain. We live alone even while surrounded by others, isolated in plain sight. It’s time that people, individually and collectively, learned to look beyond the glare into the shadows.

Last week, a Harvard student woke up to a racial slur  posted on his door.
As Harvard students, we spend so much time analyzing subtle, systemic manifestations of racism that it’s easy to forget the direct, obvious, disgusting variety. Last week, we were reminded: Crude racist cruelty still exists at Harvard.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, the target of the racist posters, has our sympathy and support. College isn’t supposed to be like this; Harvard isn’t supposed to be like this. Severely dented are illusions of an enlightened respite from the bigotry we find in the outside world. It’s particularly offensive to see these posters on the threshold of Cheng’s dorm: As college students, our dorms are our homes. A place for safety and growth, desecrated with brutal, cutting words.
The posters seem to have attacked Cheng in his role as Undergraduate Council President, complicating the aftermath. Accusing his opponents on the UC of prior harassment “influenced by anti-Asian stereotypes,” Cheng recently rejected a statement of solidarity drafted by several members of the UC. Without addressing UC politics and the competing claims at play, we support Cheng’s abstract right to reject the Council’s statement of solidarity. Surely the general autonomy which victims of racism hold in how they respond to incidents extends far enough to include Cheng’s action. That autonomy centers the victims of racist incidents when we choose how to respond; their feelings are worthy, and their experiences of fundamental importance.
That centering of the targets of racism suggests that it is a mistake to view this incident principally through the lens of UC politics. While we are shocked that our dysfunctional student government, of all things, prompted attacks of such fierce intensity, this was not primarily a reflection of the regrettable, unusual vitriol of the UC. It should not be seen primarily as a tool to moderate that vitriol, a path to enlightened unity and “cohesion,” either. Racism and racial antagonism run deeper than any internal tensions, politics, or stresses in our student organizations. Incidents like this one point to deeper problems that require deeper solutions.
We arrive at Harvard, many of us like to think, with a common understanding of the evil of racism and prejudice; we may disagree on particular applications of that principle, but the principle is supposedly shared. That complacency is misguided. We are not immune to the bias and prejudice endemic in the “real world.” We are a part of our city, our country, our world; we share in their flaws. Let this reopen our eyes. This is a Harvard problem, and more than that, it is an American problem — we should treat it as such.
When we read about anti-Asian hate in the news, we’ll now remember its explicit manifestation on our campus. When we are tempted to think of Harvard as an enlightened appendage of the world at large, we will remember that even the barest racism still manages to break through here. We will redouble our efforts to set our own house in order even as we try to change the broader world for the better.
This act was disgusting. Its execution was crude and its harms unsubtle. Ignorance feels too generous a word for an act so self-evidently wrong. Such purposeful cruelty and its perpetrators have no place on our campus.

Harambee, an organization for students of African descent at Harvard Divinity School, hosted the sixth annual Black Religion, Spirituality, and Culture Conference last week.
The two-day event included four virtual panels on topics, such as spirituality, physical wellness, and mental health. The conference's theme was “Rooted” and centered around African, Black, and indigeneous conceptions of health.
Ebony J. Johnson, the president of Harambee and a student at the Divinity School, introduced the conference as an effort to increase awareness of wellness among people of African descent.
“This conference serves to build a bridge between spirituality [and] mental health within the African diaspora,” Johnson said. “We are reframing, reshaping the narrative of Black mental health and wellness and combating against the negative stigma.”
During his opening remarks, Dean of the Divinity School David N. Hempton reaffirmed the importance of the conference in tackling social inequities and announced a five-year renewal of the conference’s funding.
“Two years ago, I made the decision to place this conference on a solid financial footing by guaranteeing its funding for three years, including this year and next year,” Hempton said. “This morning, I'm delighted to announce that this funding will be guaranteed for another five years after that. This conference fully deserves to have a permanent place in our educational landscape.”
Hempton said the Divinity School has been trying to promote diversity and inclusivity among its scholars and students.
“Here at the Divinity School, we’re trying to face up to our own responsibility to create a more diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist Divinity School,” Hempton said. “Later this semester, we hope to announce three exciting new appointments to our faculty on African Diasporic and African American Religious Studies.”
“We are taking seriously our vision of building a restorative, anti-racist and anti-oppressive Harvard Divinity School,” Hempton added.
The conference concluded with the presentation of the Sankofa Award, which recognizes Divinity School affiliates of African descent who “embody the importance of passing on wisdom, care, and commitment to the generations to come,” according to the conference’s website.
This year, the Sankofa Award was given to Jean Appolon, a Haitian dancer, choreographer, and co-founder of the dance company Jean Appolon Expressions.
Appolon said the award represents generations of work.
“The Sankofa Award doesn’t only mean Black excellence to me,” Appolon said. “It’s also described the ancestral work that we’ve been doing as artists, as Black folks, as scholars, and the way we are inspired to just continue to be healers, priests and priestesses, and many things more.”

Students across Harvard’s campus donned keffiyehs, traditional Palestinian scarves, in a show of support to Palestinians in Cambridge and abroad on Thursday.
The Harvard College Palestinian Solidarity Committee — a student group advocating for “the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, justice, and equality” — organizes scarf-wearing each week in an ongoing campaign the committee calls Keffiyeh Thursday.
“Keffiyeh Thursdays first and foremost are an expression of solidarity,” said Christian B. Tabash ’22, a PSC organizer.
Joshua D. “Josh” Willcox ’23, a member of PSC, said the motivation behind Keffiyeh Thursdays is to foster inclusivity among Palestinians — a sentiment he says has been lacking in recent years.
“We want to bring more visibility to Palestinians on campus,” Willcox said. “They don’t have the space, and they don't feel seen or heard.”
PSC chose to use the keffiyeh to demonstrate their solidarity due to the scarf’s history as “a very visible kind of cultural identity marker for a lot of Palestinians,” Willcox explained.
The keffiyeh has long been a part of traditional Palestinian garb, according to Nadine S. Bahour ’22, a PSC organizer.
“Farmers would wear it to protect their heads from the sun,” Bahour said.
Palestinians also used the keffiyeh as a protective measure to avoid arrest during the British rule of Palestine, giving the scarf a new significance as a sign of resistance, Bahour said.
“Going out of British mandate and into Israeli occupation, it also became a national symbol of resilience,” Bahour said.
PSC’s membership has seen a sharp rise over the past year, with more students participating in events and protests held by the group, according to Tabash.
“This year has been really special because you have a group of students who are so enthusiastic about spreading this cause,” Tabash said. “We started off the year with a small group, and now there's a much more sizable contingent and that has not stopped expanding.”
Despite the increased interest in Keffiyeh Thursdays, PSC still struggles to combat the association of its work with anti-Semitic sentiment, Tabash said.
“When I see people slandering our work, or mischaracterizing what pro-Palestinian activism is as anti-Semitic or rooted in hatred, it makes me sad,” he said.
Students from several other universities — including Princeton, the University of British Columbia, Texas A&M, and MIT — have joined in PSC’s movement.
“We’ve seen such a crazy response after our first week,” Willcox said. “We’re hoping that this allows us to increase the connection between all of these groups across campuses in the U.S.”
Tabash noted the movement has expanded to include non-Palestinians in support of the cause.
“There are people of all different identities who gravitated to the Palestinian cause because they see elements of suffering in their own causes or they just take a principled stance,” Tabash said.
For PSC, Keffiyeh Thursdays signal continued and growing support for Palestinians, he said.
“Having a day in the week that is devoted to expressing solidarity, and which is in effect expressing hope, I think it's something that's really powerful,” Tabash said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said in a Friday interview that school officials are discussing newly-relaxed state mask guidelines, but did not specify when — or if — the University will roll back its on-campus public health regulations.
An advisory released by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health last week no longer recommends indoor masking in most locations for healthy, fully-vaccinated residents. Masks are still required in certain settings, including transportation and health care facilities.
Cambridge and Harvard still require masks to be worn indoors.
“We have been discussing this and will continue to very seriously consider the trajectory for the mask guidelines on campus,” Nguyen said of the new state recommendations.
Nguyen’s comments come as Covid-19 cases in the greater Boston area continue to decline rapidly.
There were 151 positive cases on Harvard’s campus in the last seven days, amounting to a positivity rate of 0.48 percent, according to the University’s Covid-19 dashboard. In early January, the University recorded 976 positive cases during the peak of the Omicron variant on campus.
“The Omicron surge has receded tremendously over the last several weeks,” Nguyen said Friday. “We really hit the peak at the beginning of January and subsequently we’ve been dropping down pretty steeply, which has been great to see.”
Nguyen said it will take time for the surge to drop “all the way” due to the high number of cases recorded across the country in January.
“I don’t know exactly where we’ll land in terms of a steady state,” he said. “It may not be where we were as a steady state back in early fall of last year.”
HUHS will continue to adapt its policies as the science changes, Nguyen said.
“We have to keep in mind that the campus setting does bring more risk because of the concentration of people within classrooms, within residential housing, and so on,” he said.
Harvard has already rolled back some on-campus regulations, including a ban on in-person dining that took effect at the start of the semester. The College reopened its residential dining halls on Feb. 5.
“It’s really important to remember that well-being is so much more than the absence of COVID,” Nguyen said. “Some of the greatest risks for younger adults are the impact of social isolation, and those mental health consequences are real.”
He said the move to return to in-person dining was also driven by the high vaccination rate at Harvard, where 98 percent of students are vaccinated.
“When we made these decisions, we knew that these are decisions that affect a highly-vaccinated community of younger people who at baseline are not going to be at risk at the same degree as someone who is elderly and who has multiple chronic medical conditions,” Nguyen said.
“We were not seeing tremendously ill people, by and large,” he added.
Asked about the risks of the school’s return to in-person dining, Nguyen said unvaccinated individuals and people who have underlying medical conditions could sit farther apart from others.
“We’re really getting to a point within this pandemic experience where we have a lot more agency at the individual level,” he said. “And that's really where I think most of society is heading.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Feb. 21, Harvard men’s lacrosse took the field for the first time in over 700 days. The Crimson led from the onset, eventually taking down the New Jersey Institute of Technology, 17-4.
Harvard attacked decisively from the first whistle with a face off win by senior fogo Steven Cuccurullo, who boxed out his opponent for an easy ground ball by sophomore LSM Greg Campisi. The ball was then rotated down to the attack, where senior Austin Madronic – who scored a hat trick – junior Hayden Cheek, and first-year Sam King put their sets into action. Madronic tallied a pair of goals in the contest, and King made a shifty move around the right side of the crease to score.
“We've just gotten a lot better. Coach Corrigan was a huge help. He works a lot with the faceoff guys, and he helps us with strategy,” Cuccurullo said. “And then all the wings, Ray (first-year defender Ray Dearth), Chase (junior midfielder Chase Yager), Bryn (junior midfielder Bryn Evans), [first-year midfielder] Andrew O’Berry, Greg Campisi, [first-year defender] Martin Nelson, they're all really good athletes, and just really good players. So, it's all them, and how much they've gotten better.”
It took a few possessions for the Crimson to get into their groove. It had good takes on the cage, but was unable to finish. The offense, especially Madronic, worked well on the ride, and so had a lot of possession time in the first quarter as Harvard was consistently able to get the ball back in the midfield.
On the other end of the field, the defense looked much more cohesive than it did in its scrimmage against St. John’s on Feb. 5. Harvard’s starting lineup consisted of first-year Collin Bergstrom, first-year Tommy Martinson, and junior Chase Strupp. First-year Ray Dearth had an excellent showing, with great one-on-one coverage. He forced a couple of turnovers that turned into clean clears up field.
“Yeah, I think I think we did a great job in the ride and limiting their possession so they didn't get the ball a whole lot. I think it's hard as an offense when you're not able to get into a rhythm. I thought we played well early on. We were really physical … in the first half,” commented senior goalkeeper and captain Kyle Mullin.
The offensive middies had a dominant game, with first-year midfielder Miles Botkiss scoring a hat trick, senior Charlie Olmert tallying two goals, junior Isaiah Dawson scoring twice, and first-year Owen Gaffney recording his first collegiate goal.
They worked the ball well from up top, and did a solid job opening lanes for their adjacents so that they could take the drive down the alley. The Crimson used the inside a little bit less than in their previous showings, with the attack mainly driving down the outside. Sophomore attacker Graham Blake attributed their success to unselfish playing.
“It kind of just ended up being how they were sliding. We had stuff open inside and were sharing it, but we ended up having good takes off the dribble … We have a lot of pieces that can get open and create. I think today that's how it was but you never really know where they're gonna come from,” he noted.
Harvard recorded a shutout first half, with Mullin taking the net for the first three quarters in goal. Sophomore Christian Barnard and first-year George Alvarez split the fourth quarter, with Alvarez not allowing a score.
“I think our guys that were running scout for us did a great job this week. I think coming in we felt super prepared,” Mullin said.“We knew what they were gonna do. So, it was just about executing.”
The team will hope to execute again against No. 8 Ohio State on Feb. 26 as it travels to Naples, Fl. to compete in the Southwest Florida Shootout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stage was set for what was bound to be a legendary final for the men’s squash team nationals. With the score tied at four matches even, Harvard’s hopes rested on the shoulders of sophomore Ido Burstein, who took the court against the challenger from the University of Pennsylvania in the final and deciding match of the tournament.
A win would mean a national title for the team, personal glory, and a new trophy for the trophy case. All of this riding on one race to three games between two exceptional athletes from the two best schools in the college squash circuit.
Thursday night, No. 2 Harvard (15-1, 6-1 Ivy League) men’s squash flew down to Philadelphia, Pa., to compete for the coveted Potter Cup in the College Squash Association’s (CSA) national championship.
The team has had its eyes on the Potter Cup since the beginning of the season. While Harvard has demonstrated its fortitude on the court, coasting to a second place finish in the Ivy League, it knew it would have to overtake the Quakers to win the national tournament.
Going into the weekend, much hung in the balance, as the Crimson would be facing off against non-Ivy teams it had not faced in the regular season. It also looked ahead to a looming matchup with No.1 Penn (18-1, 6-0 Ivy League), the school responsible for the Crimson’s sole loss this season.
Back in December, first-year Tate Harms had emphasized the team’s prospects for a national championship. Once that goal was only three wins away, Harms said the mindsight of the team changed to remind themselves that nothing in sports was guaranteed.
“We wanted to take the tournament match by match. We just had to take the tournament day by day with full respect for each opponent and each match,” Harms said. “Virginia was our first match. They’re a good team, but we haven’t played them so we weren't sure how our players would line up with their players.”
In Friday’s encounter, Harvard commanded a quick 8-1 win over No. 7 Virginia (12-6) to move on to the semi-finals for the 10th year in a row.
Semi-final action pitted the Crimson against No. 6 Columbia (9-7, 1-5 Ivy League), who had upset No. 3 Trinity College (16-3).
Harvard had beaten Columbia handily in its Ancient Eight engagement last month, 8-1. This time around was no different.
Harms managed an impressive comeback win to take his match three games to two after trailing. Burstein joined in the initial charge, taking his match three games to none. Senior Victor Crouin, along with juniors George Crowne and Marwen Tarek, all contributed three-to-nothing sweeps to the Crimson’s tally, clinching the win and securing Harvard a berth in the finals for the fifth consecutive year.
And thus the Crimson took the courts against its Ivy rivals and the only team to best them this year, the University of Pennsylvania. The stage was set for what would ultimately end up being one of the most exciting CSA finales in recent years.
Crouin posted an impressive victory in the first wave of matches, rebounding from a two-game deficit to win three straight games and the match, propelling Harvard’s campaign to take a 3-2 lead in the overall tally.
Feisty play from Penn and a compelling performance from Tarek ultimately tied the score up at four. Burstein was scheduled to play in this championship deciding match.
“The energy was building with each second,” said Harms, who, having finished his play, got to spectate Burstein’s match with the rest of the Crimson. “We had Penn supporters on one half and Harvard on the other. There weren’t that many of us, but we were just letting him [Burstein] know we were there. When you’re on the court alone, you’re not actually alone. You have your guys there supporting you.”
Despite the energy, Burstein showed poise the entire time, gritting out a victory the first game, 11-9. After the match, Burstein highlighted his pre-game preparation, which allowed him to perform exceptionally under the pressure of a national championship.
“I knew my opponent was a really untraditional player,” he said. “He attacks a lot. So my main goal was to contain it by making him run a lot. And it worked. The coaches really helped with the tactics. I had a plan in my mind which allowed me to be calmer than most people expected.”
The two-point margin of the first game was the closest the Quakers would come to victory. Burstein came into the next two games hungry for a national title.
“I had the momentum with me the entire match,” he said. “The key was to stop my opponent from having any hope, because I know that he is a player who is able to come back. But I knew what I had to do to beat him. I had the tactics in my head. And I am happy that I was able to execute.”
With the help of some heroic shots to the corners, some athletic lunges, and the support of his team, Burstein would go on to win the next two games convincingly, 11-2 and 11-5, securing his first ever national championship and adding another chapter to Harvard’s decorated squash legacy.
“They all stormed the court. I still remember them screaming and smiling. It's a moment I’ll never forget. It was very special,” he recalled.
Coaches and teammates would go on to praise Burstein’s physical abilities and tactical play long after the Potter Cup was hoisted. But the aspect of his play that lifted him up above the good players into the ranks of the great players was his mental fortitude.
“Ido Burstein. Four to four tied matches and he was just as cool as could be. Wow. He played sublimely. Perfect, calm squash,” praised Harms.
If it wants to repeat in 2023, the Crimson will have to regroup, replacing the four graduating seniors, who contributed three national championships during their time in the program.
“We’re really just grateful to the seniors. We have four seniors leaving us this year, and they’re just great guys. They really represent what Harvard squash is: their work ethic, their mannerisms. They’ve given so much to the program,” Harms added.
Burstein reiterated: “We’re losing our 1, 3, 5 and 10 players. Not only are they great players on the team, but they helped guide us through the season. They support us tremendously and the team won't be the same without them. This was a great year to win and I am happy to have won with them.”
The victory marks Harvard’s third straight CSA national title, its 34th Potter Cup victory in program history, and the school’s 150th team national championship overall.

Let’s be real: taking brain breaks at Harvard can be hard. With our non-stop, everything-seemed-to-be-due-yesterday, no-seriously-my-pset-was-due-yesterday schedules, it can be difficult to take a true break where we don’t feel guilty for avoiding a pset or stressing over an essay deadline. Here’s some good-for-the-soul brain break ideas (instead of scrolling through TikTok) that will leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the rest of your day!
Taking the T to explore a new coffee shop
Don’t get me wrong - I LOVE Peet’s, Blue Bottle, Flour, and Tatte. But after a while, we all need some new excitement in our life (and to break out of the Harvard bubble). Believe it or not, hopping on the T and getting off at the next stop is almost as quick as the walk from the Yard to the Starbucks by the Prescotts! Just one stop inbound to Central Square, you can find Andala Coffee House and 1369 Coffee House. In the opposite direction, you have Revival Cafe + Kitchen and 3 Little Figs in Porter Square. Bring a book or a friend and cozy up with a new drink to disconnect from the busyness of Harvard.
Journaling 
Journaling is an underrated brain break. It allows you to reset by dumping all of your thoughts and feelings on the page. Kinda like an overdue cry! It always leaves me feeling exceptionally refreshed.
Seeing a Harvard Theater Production
You see the flyers posted all over the bulletin board in your dorm and swipe through so many Instagram stories, but never go. Now is your time! Harvard brims with talent, so instead of spending the evening in Lamont, spend it with some showtunes! There is no better way to dissociate than getting lost in the plot of a heartfelt or tear-jerking production, and it’s way better on your eyes than binging season two of Euphoria.
Attending a workout class at the MAC or Hemenway 
Working out is a known stress reliever, and you’ll be way too busy trying to figure out zumba moves that your pset due tomorrow will seem miles away. And, the classes are free! I recommend inviting a friend to cry sweat with you. After hunching over your laptop in Lamont with the posture of your gamer-boy ex for hours, your body will thank you.
Charcuterie Snack Break 
Who doesn’t love an aesthetic, Instagram-worthy charcuterie board? Block out an hour of your day, invite some friends, and have everyone bring something to contribute to the board (Trader Joe's cheese, anyone?). It’s a great midday (or midnight) pick-me-up and an awesome way to socialize while munching on some good food (Sorry, Berg).
In our world of constant late night Lamont-ing, taking an hour for yourself will make a world of difference and help eliminate burn out. Go ahead and block out weekly brain breaks on your Gcal (maybe send a Gcal invite to some friends?) Your brain and soul will thank you!
