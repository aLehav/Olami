The seventeenth iteration of “Hell’s Kitchen” is shaping up to be the most heated season yet. The season premiere checked all the boxes for those familiar with the show: intense culinary challenges, fiery interactions between contestants, and an angry Gordon Ramsay. And yet the newest season of “Hell’s Kitchen” is so relentless in its pursuit of drama that it leaves the realm of entertainment and enters one of ridiculousness.
From the moment the episode starts, it is clear that the season will be primarily character-driven—this season is particularly special because it offers a cast of All-Stars, tried-and-true heroes and villains of past seasons. Stepping through an entrance marked “VIP Entry,” the contestants bring a strong sense of familiarity and experience to the show. The cast members, who come from various past seasons, were not chosen simply because they were fan favorites. It’s obvious from the reactions to their entrances—the shocked gasps and dirty looks shot across the room—that they were hand-picked with conflict in mind. As the voiceover promises, “when you give a second chance to the most relentless chefs in the world, you end up with the most electrifying season ever.”
Unfortunately the show’s central conceit—the high-tension arguments and incessant fighting—is not convincing. Rather than setting up believable character arcs and allowing conflict to develop organically, the show has created caricatures of its contestants. This is clearest in the case of Elise Harris, a third-place finisher from season nine and the clear frontrunner of the villains of the show. When she delivers her confessional, “There’s not a day that goes past that I don’t think about the fact that I did not win,” the scripted line feels so insincere, so absent of any self-awareness, that it is almost comical.
This hyperbolic attitude doesn’t end with the contestants. The new season is introduced with a full red carpet, complete with paparazzi and hordes of adoring super-fans. The All-Stars, largely dressed in plain t-shirts and jeans as they run past photographers taking glamorous headshots, are greeted with intense applause. This need to create a cult of personality for a cooking show is unbelievably self-aggrandizing.
Ironically, for all the over-the-top theatrics the show provides, the one thing “Hell’s Kitchen” lacks is actual cooking. Among the distractions, one almost forgets why all of the chefs are gathered together. The kitchen scenes are short and focus on important individuals rather than the process they take to create their dishes. Even the tasting process, where Ramsay stokes the drama by keeping the point values close through arbitrary judgments, severely downplays the cooking. Between criticism of one chef’s raw eggplant, Ramsay sprinkles comments about the contestants’ families and past relationships.
The show’s plot is painfully manufactured as well. The show fails to balance its need to both foreshadow judgement and minimize screen time for meal preparation. The chefs that do have their cooking processes shown—Robyn Almodovar, for example, who struggles to sear salmon skin—are included for conspicuous reasons and ruin all the suspense.
Momentarily exciting but not worth substantial investment, “Hell’s Kitchen” falls into the category of reality television shows that have sacrificed narrative for utterly mindless action. The season should only get wilder from here, but even reality television drama can have diminishing returns. Most importantly, although the genre is clearly processed for effect, the palpable presence of the show writers ultimately creates a product not worth suspending disbelief over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three seasons of Pfefferman farce, fans of Jill Soloway’s critically acclaimed Amazon original, “Transparent,” are well aware of the family’s nonsensical, albeit addicting, histrionics. “Transparent” has never been the type of show to shy away from the uncomfortable, and Season Four of the series is no different, once again drawing viewers in with its raw portrayals of familial, religious, and for the first time, international dissonance. Set to the beat of “Everything’s Alright” from “Jesus Christ Superstar,” Season Four brilliantly builds off of the ideas of identity and inherited trauma that drove the show’s previous seasons, while opening up space to explore yet another recurring and related theme in the Pfefferman’s lives: the role of physical and metaphysical borders.
For a show that prides itself on its unabashedly political portrayal of the postmodern American-Jewish experience, a trip to Israel—the driving force behind Season Four—seems like an inevitable, yet perhaps cliché move for the Pfefferman clan. Rest assured, however, the portrait of the comically dysfunctional family in the Holy Land is anything but banal. Soloway (who uses singular they pronouns) truly outdoes themselves in Season Four, propelling the plot  forward through a combination of impressive cinematography and stunning screenplay that work together to reveal its characters’ deeper truths. This season is remarkable by all accounts, but what separates it from its predecessors is the ease with which dialogue flows between characters. Sheathed in humor and delivered via suckerpunch, the Pfeffermans’ yiddishe banter hits harder than it ever has before, shedding light not only on each of our characters’ individuality, but also on the often ironic realities that govern our lives (and theirs, of course).
“The problem with the two-state solution,” Shelly (Judith Light), our beloved Pfefferman matriarch, says at one point in the crossfire of family repartee, “is that it sounds too much like the Final Solution,” offering a subtle, yet poignant jab at a decades-long conflict rooted in a religious and identity-driven binary. This, however, is merely one of the many sharp lines Shelly doles out. After three seasons of slow character development, we finally begin to see Shelly as more than just the nagging mother figure. She’s fiery, brave, and—like the rest of the Pfeffermans—her inability to come to terms with her past has left her incapable of staying within an appropriate proximity to the people around her. When her son, Josh (Jay Duplass), calls her a “boundary pusher” after she flagrantly cuts ties with her condominium complex and moves in with him, she cries back that she truly has “no idea what boundaries are!”
Shelly and Josh are not the only Pfeffermans dealing with the repercussions of vaguely-outlined boundaries. After finding out that Leslie (Cherry Jones), her ex-lover and accused-sex-offender, has published a poem in the “New Yorker” about her vagina, Ali decides to accompany Maura (Jeffrey Tambor), who is set to deliver a keynote on Judaism and gender, to Israel. There, she becomes swept away by new love-interest Lyfe (Folake Olowofoyeku) and company who “only eat Bamba when they’re drunk” as to not support the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Between her exploration into her own gender fluidity and the subsequent assault on her identity by her ex-girlfriend, her questioning of the ethics and politics of the Jewish state, and the quite-literal occupation of her L.A. apartment by a family of bizarre Airbnb-ers, Ali appears to be stuck at a traverse of all sorts of boundaries and binaries.
What began as a quick two-week journey to the Holy Land quickly becomes a Pfefferman family affair, and although Ali leaves her family’s quasi-birthright trip in favor of a more enriching experience on her friend’s farm in Ramallah, the remaining Pfefferman children and their parents continue to wander the country, arousing and examining interfamilial and international discord. We are reminded by Josh’s ex-weed dealer that “boundaries are how people tell other people what they need,” but until the Pfeffermans can figure out exactly what it is they need, the boundaries they try to establish with each other and the world around them are destined to remain foggy. It’s impossible to predict what this process of self-reflection will look like, but if it’s anything like their journey this season, it’s en route to be one marked by the humor of a beautifully captured and purely human spirit.
