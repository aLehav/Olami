After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past March, amid widespread uncertainty and trepidation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, many prominent galleries including Lévy Gorvy’s Old Bond Street location and Pace Gallery’s Chelsea outpost closed their doors to the public. Now, six months later, despite the lingering shadow of COVID-19, many art galleries have opened their physical spaces, albeit by appointment only. In the interim, from old masters to 20th century, from London to Shanghai, virtual exhibitions burst forth on the internet. In an industry marked by ever-changing trends and fast-paced, aggressive development, it should come as no surprise that in the face of compulsory restrictions and lingering angst, scores of art galleries swiftly adopted and thrived on virtual exhibitions.
Unimpeded by shifting lighting conditions and display labels peeling from the walls, galleries have taken advantage of the internet to present their art in optimal conditions. Such superlative online platforms then beg the question: Without the unequivocal tokens of success associated with prime physical locations such as Mayfair in London and Madison Avenue in New York City, or the distinct potentiality of gripping window displays and revealing glass walls, how do galleries distinguish themselves from one another? As it turns out, they often don’t. Hop onto the websites of David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, White Cube, and the like — most of which are free of charge — and minimally different digital experiences will transpire: captioned as “viewing room,” “online exhibition,” or “digital catalogue,” the subpages are essentially long-scroll sites comprised of alternating images and words with slideshows and videos interspersed throughout and — the most amusing identical feature of all — quotations fixed in their own conspicuously separate text boxes.
Granted, some digital galleries do offer other forms of navigation; one can partake in virtual tours, clicking arrows similar to those in Google Maps, or make use of augmented reality tools, projecting artworks anywhere and everywhere. With illuminated screens as well as rows of zeros and ones acting as common threads, viewers can virtually wander through quasi-normal, pre-pandemic gallery environments or visualize coveted yet pricey art on one’s private walls. Of course, continually scrolling through a webpage is almost always an option.
Surprisingly, in the age of social distancing, galleries have become closer — business-wise — to other art-related firms. With an already robust online sales structure in place, influential institutions, namely auction houses, host galleries on their digital marketplaces, boasting directness and efficiency; in return, galleries exclusively consign works of art and pay commission to the auction houses. These still somewhat fresh collaborations, or the auction-house-and-gallery hybrid sales model, notably include Sotheby’s Gallery Network and Christie’s partnership with La Biennale Paris. With a combined total of 73 galleries working with the auction-house duopoly, the joint enterprises epitomize the art industry’s capacity to innovate under pressure. Considering their virtual, customizable, and profitable features, digital art spaces will surely prevail long after the pandemic.

Everybody loves Baby Yoda. “The Mandalorian,” helmed by showrunner Jon Favreau, was the “Star Wars” franchise’s first foray into the world of live action television, and it was met with widespread acclaim from fans and critics alike. The first season concluded this past spring, leaving fans hungry for more.
The finale left the titular Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal) ready to embark on a quest to return the Child (better known to viewers as Baby Yoda) to its people — a mysterious “order of sorcerers — called Jedi.” The appearance of chief antagonist Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) raised the stakes as viewers learned that he was in possession of the darksaber, a weapon that played a significant role in the animated series “Star Wars: The Clone Wars” and “Star Wars Rebels.”
Any “Star Wars” project is bound to be highly anticipated, and Season Two of “The Mandalorian” is no exception. The show was very lucky to have finished shooting just days before the pandemic struck. Due to the remarkable efforts of the team during quarantine, the show was able to stay on schedule for an October 2020 premiere. The first trailer for Season Two reveals glimpses of new planets, mysterious characters, and even some X-wings. This first look teased that Mando’s world is about to get a lot bigger as he travels the galaxy in his quest to find the enigmatic Jedi. This new season has extraordinary potential to continue to tell a unique “Star Wars” story with engaging characters, but whether or not it will succumb to fan service remains to be seen.
In the marketing for Season One last fall, Baby Yoda was kept entirely secret to preserve a dramatic reveal. Could audiences be in for another surprise character appearance? There have been many rumors, and sources suggest that a multitude of fan favorite characters will be joining the cast of “The Mandalorian” — most notably former Jedi padawan Ahsoka Tano (previously seen only in animated form) and bounty hunter Boba Fett (who briefly appeared in the original trilogy). Other popular animated characters such as Captain Rex, Bo-Katan Kryze, and Sabine Wren have been rumored to be making their live action debuts. At first glance, bringing Mando together with all these characters may seem like a “Star Wars” fan’s dream — but could it backfire?
Overdoing fan service has not served “Star Wars” well in the past, and giving into it now would deal “The Mandalorian” (and the franchise as a whole) a crippling blow. Many critics and a large subset of audiences criticized “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” (2019) for excessively pandering to fans. The film sacrificed story just to include moments that fans wanted to see, and critical plot elements established in earlier films (like Rey’s parentage) were seemingly reversed. Bold choices such as bringing fan favorite character Emperor Palpatine back to life (it’s complicated) may have seemed like good moves on paper, but they were widely considered to be poorly executed.
It’s tempting to want to see “The Mandalorian” connect itself more deeply to stories and characters that fans already know, but doing so would diminish what made the first season so great. Season One took audiences to a galaxy they’d been to before, but it didn’t repeat the same stories with the same characters. It stood on its own, enjoyable for both long-time “Star Wars” fans who appreciated the references and new viewers who just liked the show. Remarkably, the word “Jedi” was said only once the entire first season, in a very impactful and tantalizing moment. This is when fan service in “Star Wars” is at its best: in layers of details that contribute rather than distract, and in dramatic moments that serve the story.
If Season Two wants to see the same widespread success as Season One, it will need to toe this line carefully — and if it does, then audiences could be in for another fantastic adventure in a galaxy far, far away.
Season Two of “The Mandalorian” premieres on Disney+ on Oct. 30.

These days, it seems as though every celebrity gets their own memoir. David Chang, founder of the Momofuku Group and star of Netflix television series “Ugly Delicious,” is no exception to the growing trend of industry stars penning mildly interesting narratives of early adversities that end up flourishing into professional success. Early on in the memoir, Chang expresses with characteristic self-deprecation his reservations regarding his current prestige and fame: “Why is my word more valuable than anyone else’s,” Chang writes. “What makes anyone think I know better than them?”
It is, however, precisely this self-doubt — coupled with his conviction that there is always room for growth — that cemented Chang’s status as a behemoth in the contemporary American culinary landscape. Organized into two parts titled “Up the Hill” and “Down and Back Again,” Chang’s memoir “Eat a Peach” explores the dimensional growth, missteps, and triumphs of his experience as a Korean-American chef while interrogating the emotional burdens and moral ambiguities underpinning his dizzying rise to acclaim.
Between descriptions of staunch Korean churchgoers, high school bullies, hierarchical kitchens and the abyssal depths of mental illness, Chang elucidates the numerous personal struggles he navigated during adolescence and early adulthood. It is during these moments of internal turbulence that Chang’s incisive observational powers shine.
As he reflects on the humble beginnings of what would later become the Momofuku empire, he deftly limns the dissonant tension he felt between theory and praxis — between where he was and whom he yearned to become. Chang recounts the liberating revelation that galvanized him to helm his business on his own terms: “If I wasn’t cooking food I believed in, then what was I even doing?”
It is no coincidence, then, that Momofuku — a restaurant famous for drawing from multiple culinary traditions to deliver a subversive dining experience — began its ascent just as Chang and his companions abandoned convention in favor of dynamic experimentation: “You can’t rely on common wisdom in the kitchen,” he notes. “Most of it is built on half-truths and outdated assumptions. Be open to every idea.”
Chang’s is a story deeply rooted in the redemptive potential of failure as a tool for reappraisal and radical creativity. It is also a story of the stochastic, pernicious influence of mental illness on one’s relationships and self-image. The painful episodes of verbal and emotional violence that Chang inflicts on both others and himself as he struggles with anxiety, mania, and suicidal ideation act as a through-line in the narrative at large, begging the questions: How can one heal from, channel, and perhaps even reverse patterns of harm? Furthermore, how can one recognize the validity of emotional complexities without allowing them to derail one’s life?
To characterize “Eat a Peach” simply as a memoir of trauma and tenacity, however, would be deeply remiss. The text’s greatest strength lies not in its abstractions but, rather, in its fastidious commitment to illuminating the minutiae. Between broader reflections on racism, artistic innovation, and the complicated demands of cultural hybridity lie details that suffuse the text with vibrance and warmth: A caramelized pork shoulder glistening under kitchen lights serves as a testament to the value of relentless experimentation; a 1968 photograph of The Band at Woodstock hanging in the Momofuku Noodle Bar embodies the “rugged humility” Chang yearns to instill in his brand. The myth of lobsters’ immortality — one presupposed upon their capacity to mold indefinitely — expands to metaphorically denote Chang’s insistence that transformation ends only with the end of life.
Another charismatic quality of the memoir is its rich evocation of haute cuisine. Chang’s gastronomic descriptions — from truffle-stuffed chicken to lemon-and-chard lamb belly, broken buttermilk panna cotta to sliced ham garnished with coffee-infused mayonnaise — are striking, exhilarating, and, perhaps most important, just plain fun.
Rarely is food articulated in such mindful and exacting ways: The deferential care Chang brings to each culinary act serves as a reminder that something as seemingly mundane as a single meal possesses the capacity for newness and, if we are so lucky, artistic poignance.
Chang never promises his readers a smooth ride. Rather, the cohering disposition of the text is one of emotional volatility. It is often frustrating and uncomfortable to bear witness to Chang’s self-destructive behaviors, as well as his tendency to externalize this harm to others. It is precisely his vulnerable honesty — and his genuine remorse for recurrent patterns of ego-driven vindictiveness — that make him a begrudgingly credible speaker.
The deeply felt, startling candor with which Chang recounts his myriad adversities lends a confessional intimacy that keeps the text’s self-help bent from collapsing into didacticism. His is a paean to embracing the dual forces of turbulence and transformation, one that readers would do well to remember as they navigate the challenges of their particular realities.

“Home,” released this September by Two Lines Press, is an anthology of pensive poems written by nine writers from the Arabic-speaking world. The book contains both the Arabic originals and their English translations, put together by a litany of translators with impressive resumes. But while many readers may immediately be daunted –– or even outright turned off –– by an unabashedly literary work containing English printed side-by-side with a language foreign to many Americans, this collection makes for an unimposing and rather quick and relaxing read. It is also so much more than just that.
As is usually the case with poetry, the true substance of the work lies not in the words used themselves –– or, for that matter, the language they are written in –– but in the thoughts they engender. “Home” is no different. Indeed, its true beauty lies in the way in which its poems reveal to the English-speaking reader that the minds giving life to these observations and these ideas – those minds living in worlds so far away and for some so hard to imagine – are not so different from their own.
It is the theme underlying the anthology that makes this mission so effective. On its back cover, “Home” proudly announces its goal of celebrating “language and its power to transform, expand, and enchant even the most familiar surroundings,” and celebrate it does. From exhaling on a mirror in a bathroom full of steam, to watching a woman sit still with her eyes fixed on a clothesline, to a silent, rainy night with a lover in Bordeaux, the moments described in each poem seem frozen in time, woven together with slow, soft, almost dream-like imagery. Indeed, it is this imagery that dominates and gives life to the anthology, lending the work a mood that is still, peaceful, quiet, and even a bit somber.
It creates an atmosphere that is ripe for reflection, with the abundant white space on each page adding to this effect. Likewise, the lack of rhyme throughout the collection prevents any of the poems from taking on a lyricism or song-like quality that would detract from their meditative character. The result is a calming and relaxing experience, one that, with all of today’s distractions, has become somewhat of a rarity.
Perhaps what makes so compelling the images presented by the poets in “Home” is how familiar they feel. Many of them seem drawn from those moments in life when one gives second thought to what have always seemed like the most trivial of details — moments from which a new and sometimes revolutionary perspective is often born. In this way, “Home” is perfectly suited for the modern world, where it is so easy to forget the simple act of thinking whilst lost in the doldrums of routine.
As one moves further through the anthology, reading at the leisurely pace to which it so well lends itself, the serene, almost surreal images of the first poems give way to those that ask deeper, more profound questions about topics ranging from good and evil to death and divorce. For the most part, these weightier motifs –– expressed with very appreciable skill by the poets –– are incorporated well by the editors, and they enhance the work by giving it philosophical undertones that go beyond the refreshingly astute observations of the quotidian that already make the anthology so enjoyable.
There is one poem, however, that while included in this vein of bringing deeper themes into the work, hurts “Home” more than it helps it. Riyad al-Salih al-Hussein’s “A Marseillaise for the Neutron Age” is too abrasive and too cynical to mesh well with the rest of the anthology. While its condemnation and lamentation of the modern age, touted by the editors, may well have been prescient when the poem was written in the mid-20th century, its message is far too trite in 2020 to be worthy of much appreciation.
But this is a minor and forgivable slip-up. On the whole, “Home” lends its readers an experience that is at once fluid and thought-provoking, one that makes it easy to lose track of time and, more importantly, context. Indeed, the images provoked and questions asked by the poets of “Home” are so pertinent to modern America that at times the only reminder that these same poets hail from a radically different culture is the Arabic text printed on every even page. But that is the point: by the end of the anthology, the American reader is left to wonder how different this culture really is from his own. The poets’ suggestion? Less than the reader might think.

My name is Sam.
That is not my name.
They eat my name, and they eat the name of my brother. He is not my brother but becomes my brother just as she is not my sister but becomes my sister. They eat her name too.
I don’t understand their names. I don’t understand my name. I understand eyes. My sister’s eyes are dark. My brother’s eyes are dark. Glass tells me that my eyes are dark.
They don’t want us to survive. They eat our names first. Afterwards, they sign our graves with the names of no ones. They spit with disgust. Their hate twists the ocean. The ocean swallows the world. The world dies, and their business is in death.
Death is more than not living.
Death is theft.
Death is destruction.
Death is the recognition of life.
Death is the suffocation of life.
We make ourselves brothers and sisters. We find the lines in the cosmic skies. It’s the only way to survive when they eat your name.
I don’t know anywhere other than these planks. Wood whispers like death wandering when locked between sea and stale air.
There are no stories. There is nothing to explain when there is no world. They did it to destroy our world and to destroy us. The endless periods of light and dark suspend us in a gap in the universe. Spacelessness removes us from the world. It’s what they want. It becomes easiest to cultivate death in bodies trapped in nowhereland.
There are twenty five of us, two always chained together. I am chained to my brother. Our ankles have no skin. We dance to move, and the twenty men who command the waves tell us how to dance. We dance in shit. We dance in piss. We dance in front of the guns. There are thirteen. One for each pair. One for the lone man. They hit him for fun until he pisses onto the wood that cries at night, but his back never breaks.
We don’t cry at night. They don’t like that. I listen in the dark and wish it was me.
It’s not just us in the dark. It’s spices too. And gold. That’s where we came from. Those white sands reek of gold and bodies with no skin. At least they are still alive. Except for those who aren’t.
They don’t want that kind of death, death in the sands. They don’t want death in the water either. They want death that still walks.
It makes us like spices, like gold. Only their eyes don’t glimmer at the sight of our skin like they do at the gold in their hands. Their eyes burn a fire of greed that blows the boat forward. I don’t know how much longer we have until we die. My world is already gone.
The wind smells a bad smell, the smell if you fish on a Tuesday, the smell of a great disaster, a smell no one, not even the men who burn with greed, can chain.
Footsteps sound fast above us. Soft thuds of rain grow louder and harder and faster until I can barely hear the voices of men shouting through the wood. Water pools at our feet. It stains with the piss and shit that’s dried to the boards. None of us below speak.
Shouts come. The hatch opens, and a dark sky shines down from above. The men snatch crates filled with gold and spices. They yell things at me. One brother pisses himself, only this time from no switch. The men steal the crates and hurry back to the deck.
The open sky screams when I peek my head from the still-open hatch. The mounted guns point to the sky and to the water, but they can’t threaten life they cannot kill. From across the ledge of the boat and through the thrashing waves, a world emerges. I know it’s not my world. My world is already gone.
The men throw crates into a small boat in the middle of the deck. Fire cracks from the sky. Water reaches up from the side and tries to pull us down. The men only care about their crates of gold.
My brothers and sisters scramble around the deck. The boat tilts down to the left and begins its descent into wordlessness. There is nowhere for us to go but down.
Two sisters halt in the loud darkness. They speak through their eyes, and the water swallows them.
My brothers and sisters look at each other, their eyes saying the same thing. One bloodied pair after the other falls into the sea. No one is there to tell us how to dance across the waves. Bodies glimmer in the light of the fire in the sky. The fall is the only hope they have to keep from collapsing in the destruction of the false world outside of worlds.
The little boat crashes into the water. Before I see the faces of the twenty men, my brother pulls my chain and me off the ledge now lifted towards the sky. I don’t want to die. I never wanted to die. They want my death and my body too. Now they have neither. But this doesn’t solve the story.
No one has anyone.
Not here. Not in these waters.
Just before I fall under the second layer of black skies, I peer through the crashes of the foaming water. My lone brother who is chained to no one bobs near the little boat. He’s the last one I can see. Everyone else is gone. He struggles to grab onto the edge of the little boat. I don’t flinch when the man above him breaks the wooden oar against his face. The water doesn’t change color. It’s already stained with blood.
All of that piss and shit for nothing.
We dance below the waters, this time the shackles don’t hurt so much against our raw bodies, this time we dance for no audience. No men, no women, only the rotting bodies of imputed souls lying at the bottom of the world of no worlds. I dance to find my soul.
They eat my name, but someone will find it again.

I’ve fallen into a pattern of going to sleep early. Sometimes as early as 9 p.m. So, staying up until 11:30 p.m. to watch the season premiere of “Saturday Night Live” — even though I love the show and have been eagerly awaiting its return for months — was a commitment, an action of intention.
When season 46 kicked into gear on October 3, I was anxious to see the cold open, which would no doubt satirize that week’s presidential debate. The debate had been beyond chaotic, providing an abundance of material to draw from. And indeed, Alec Baldwin’s President Donald Trump interrupts the moderator a lot. Jim Carrey’s Joe Biden struggles to hold back his seething anger and disdain. Trump says something stupid; Biden loses his train of thought. We’ve seen these bits before, and honestly, we’ve seen them done better. The scene comes to a close with a humorous but not so covertly sincere plea to the viewer to vote. For Biden, of course.
At this point I thought, Okay, the cold open fell a little flat, but the monologue can’t possibly disappoint. This is Chris Rock we’re talking about. One of the funniest comedians out there. He starts his monologue, but his use of pronouns is kind of strange, isn’t it? “We’ve got to take it serious,” he says about the election. “You know, like I watch, the Republicans take it serious.” We: himself and the viewer at home. But then, a group that is not so we. The Republicans: a they.
Conservatives are the outsiders here, and Democrats are the in-group. Liberals are a part of this community — they are the “us.” Conservatives are some strange collective out in the ether that couldn’t possibly do something as normal as consume primetime media.
Chris Rock, your Hollywood is showing. It seems you’ve spent too much time away from the political diversity that exists in this country, sheltered among your high-rolling friends. You must have forgotten that tens of millions of Americans identify as conservative. Surely some of them watch SNL and are part of the “we” you are talking to.
Begging audience members to vote for a specific candidate is not funny. Excluding Republicans from the joke doesn’t just narrow SNL’s audience. Allowing a small group of joke writers to decide who’s allowed in popular culture creates further divisions in a country that’s already pulling apart at the seams.
Humor is more than lightheartedness. It can powerfully deliver political messages in a digestible, persuasive way. Humor is subversive. It is a means of survival. It makes a statement and sets a cultural tone.
As philosopher Henri Bergson claims, laughter is distinctly human and social. Laughter finds amusement in all things relating to human life: mobility and its malfunctions, interactions and their blunders, the non-mechanical nature of human existence. This connects directly to laughter’s social nature. Humans are social creatures. We bond over the mishaps we all encounter, using laughter to react, heal, and brave the challenges we face. We laugh along to show support and camaraderie.
However, there is a dangerous flip side. Humor can draw boundaries between factions. Who finds what funny can pull people together, but it can also create tribes and leave some people on the outskirts.
Humor finds its cruel edge when we laugh at and not with. Malice seeps into jokes far too often and leads to a laughter that harms. As a society, we should be striving to move away from willful debasement of those who are not like us. We should seek to be inclusive, open-minded, and respectful — even in our jokes. Or if we lose a little bit of that respect, at least we should prevent ourselves from directing distaste and anger at one group alone. It is possible to keep comedy subversive and entertaining while simultaneously preventing it from being plain mean.
SNL has been beloved by Americans for decades. It should continue to be an American staple. But that means it has to be accessible to all Americans. It should be critical and sharp, witty and boundary-pushing. Backing one political candidate and writing off the party you find inferior is none of those things. It’s the easy way out for people who don’t want to challenge their perspectives or reach outside their bubble.
So show us Trump’s aggression in interrupting the moderator, but make us rethink what it means to have an aggressive president. Show us Biden’s resentment, but comment on the broader significance it has for voters who share this view. Comedy’s role is not to take jabs for the sake of taking jabs. It is to reveal the parts of issues that hide beneath the surface. There are greater implications to what happened at the presidential debate, and laughter is the first step to understanding. If we can laugh at the forces that divide us, we take away their power. Only from there can we proceed to remedy what ails this nation.

“Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.” In his 1947 novel, “The Plague,” Albert Camus reaches the philosophical conclusion that life is random and absurd. And today, this sentiment resonates more than ever. Plagues have ravaged humanity for all of history, yet, it’s hard for us to believe that we are actually living through one of them.
Our behavior has changed because of the pandemic — or maybe our true natures have simply been exposed. Young people are acting out, and very often we don’t abide by the rules. It’s happening on our very own campus. Students are being dismissed for hosting indoor parties while others are congregating along the Charles River maskless. Beyond Cambridge, Instagram and Snapchat stories regularly document gatherings that are far too large. And in places like Kentucky and Alabama, people are abandoning responsibility completely, hosting “coronavirus parties.” It seems like we are acting careless to the point of illogical.
But Camus rationalizes our behavior and holds up a mirror to our society. He shows us that there’s more to our psychology than simple recklessness. He articulates feelings we might not even consciously recognize – that we are “impatient of the present and cheated of the future.” Amid rules and restrictions, we have been deprived of our normal lives, so we rebel. The pandemic feels unfair, inexplicable, and overwhelming. Our freedom has been compromised. The liberty to do ‘what we want, when we want’ has been revoked, and out of dread and denial, we rebel to exercise what little agency we have left.
Ultimately, however, Camus contends this kind of rebellion is futile. In the town of Oran, where the novel takes place, the citizens’ display of luxury, lavish spending, and gluttony provides only short term gratification. There’s a “frantic desire for life that thrives in the heart of every great calamity” and this strong desire is in our lives, too. We’re a generation accustomed to extreme accessibility. With just a smartphone app, we can access anything from pizza to a potential love interest. Accustomed to instant gratification provided by the machines in our pockets, we are reluctant to tolerate life any other way or lose our control over pleasure.
But rebellion out of stubbornness and selfishness is useless to us and harmful to those around us. The reality is that this behavior doesn’t allow us to reclaim old liberties. Rather, it perpetuates a vicious cycle in which we try to make ourselves feel better by doing things that ultimately make us feel worse and which are potentially fatal for others. We are fighting the wrong fight.
For Camus, nevertheless, the fight in itself isn’t worthless. “It may be shameful to be happy by oneself,” he admits. Young people shouldn’t rebel to satisfy personal desires or to demand pre-COVID life. Instead, Camus proposes a different kind of rebellion that provides true liberation: the revolt against human suffering and the fight for life. Dr. Rieux, the novel’s central character, is the epitome of this ethos. He works tirelessly to remedy his patients from the plague, often with little success. However, he persists. In a most symbolic moment, Dr. Rieux tends to an ill boy despite his knowledge that it’s a “losing fight” purely for the sake of the boy’s born right to live. He demonstrates that the fight itself may be lost, but in an absurd life, one that feels random and unfair, living for the struggle to end oppression and protect life is the most we can do to create meaning within meaninglessness. And philosophical theories aside, Dr. Rieux’s deeds most concretely provoke us to remember how grateful we should be for the real nurses and doctors who thanklessly fight for patients’ lives daily. Undoubtedly, their fight is one worth revering.
Certainly, young people are feeling powerless in the face of COVID. I acknowledge it isn’t easy to discard our desires in the name of some huge, lofty cause. It isn’t easy to be like Dr. Rieux. But we need to remember that the fight — the right fight to help others who are more at risk than us — must go on. We can’t defy the virus, but if we are diligent, we can fight for our humanity. However inconsequential our fight may seem, our efforts are crucial. However restricted we may feel, we do have freedom of choice. We can choose to make decisions that positively impact our futures.
“Plague? Just life, no more than that.” An old patient of Rieux’s tells us the struggle against plague is a struggle like any other. We should remember this in times of pandemic and otherwise because pestilences are all around us. Our world is plagued with conflict: racial injustice, gender inequality, class conflict and environmental degradation just to name a few. It can all feel so overwhelmingly unfair.
But Camus’s notion that all this suffering is just life — while it seems at first a resignation to a futile fight — is actually a source of possibility and even hope. If we look through Camus’s absurdist eyes, life lacks any inherent meaning. However, our revolt proves to us that we are in fact free to make decisions and from these choices, we can derive the meaning we seek and which is necessary to persist. We have the privilege to fight for human rights. We can take a stand, vote, change our behaviors — resist.
If we act more like Dr. Rieux and less like the citizens of Oran, we will create a freer world for everyone, ourselves included. But of course, by the end of his novel, Camus doesn’t leave us with an Oran completely healed. Often that’s not how life works. “The plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good,” nor should we expect it to. As philosopher Alain de Botton affirms, “life is a hospice, never a hospital.” Our world will never completely recover — it will never be entirely healthy. Life might never feel completely fair. All we can do, then, is take heart in knowing it’s the struggle that counts, and if we fight for life, just maybe this will be relief enough from any plague.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the key questions those who have accused high-profile faculty of sexual harassment are bringing to the table is whether they should have a seat at the table. Most recently, 12 women who accused Anthropology professors Gary Urton and John L. Comaroff and Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez have written to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay to ask for representation on the committee reviewing the University's pair of interim Title IX policies.
That’s a question Dominguez accusers have been pressing since 2018, when the Chronicle of Higher Education broke the story of the scope and duration of his abuses and Harvard’s failure to address them. Dominguez accusers later criticized both the University’s external review of University culture for being “disinterested” in their accounts.
And though Dean Gay has stated, in regards to the current Title IX review, that the “committee will establish channels for collecting input from the FAS community on this important issue,” it is time that the people affected by sexual harassment and violence have a well-clarified and prominent role in the University’s approach to sexual assault on campus.
These accusers have personally experienced the Title IX process. They have done their best to use the system to obtain justice. They know the effectiveness of Title IX, and the ineffectiveness. They know which Title IX policies encouraged them to press forward, and which practices worked to suppress their voices. They understand the complexity of using a Harvard entity against a Harvard faculty member. Others can only imagine how a system would work without using it. The lived experience of a system is critical to making an informed review of the interim Title IX policies.
It is more than evident that these women hold crucial insight into Title IX’s processes and its effectiveness in its mission to protect against gender discrimination. Their experiences should be more than an informative voice taken into consideration. In the development of a long-term Title IX Policy, we want to see the voices of the accusers of Professors Comaroff, Urton, and Dominguez tangibly incorporated. These women should be represented in an institutionalized role in the Title IX interim policy review. Their demand should be answered with either a seat on this committee or with another method that will ensure their voices hold power and influence in this determination process. It is not enough alone for their voices to simply be heard.
There is a historical trend for the individuals who are most affected by policies to not be the ones actually designing them — indeed, this tradition is at the core of why some systems continue to perpetuate harm, and of how those at the top of them stay there. It is therefore absolutely critical that people who have been personally wronged have a seat at the table helping to repair the systems that constrained and oppressed them. Ultimately, the frustrations and inefficiencies of systems of enforcement and legal procedure, such as the Title IX legal regime, are understood uniquely well by those who have had to navigate them. That is why it is essential that the new committee being formed to review the FAS’s interim sexual harassment policy includes past complainants, helping ensure that it is complainants, not respondents, who are most served and protected by Title IX policies.
To be sure, from a practical standpoint, not all accusers can have a seat on review boards and committees. And we understand that the University will have to take these logistics into account. But it is incumbent upon these committees, if they want to successfully carry out their work, to think about how they can incorporate these perspectives in a more robust and transparent way than the cursory surveys and polite meetings on which they have historically relied.
This, ultimately, is the critical point: should they fail to adequately include — not just for show, but with real, rule-making power — survivors of sexual assault and harassment, the committee will deprive itself of the most critical perspective in tackling the problem. In so doing, it will doom itself to failure. Instead, hand-wringing and the persistence of the problem seem likely to follow.
The opacity of the committee’s work makes it difficult to opine on the issue of who else should be on the committee — and this is part of the problem. As students, we have little insight into how these sorts of decisions get made and into the extent the policymakers consider the needs of students, as opposed to the University’s interest to protect itself legally.
Having a stake in the process should mean having a say in the process. This necessarily involves both representation and transparency.

Researchers from Stanford University estimated that fewer than one tenth of the American adult population have COVID-19 antibodies, suggesting that the U.S. is still far from achieving herd immunity.
The study relied on blood samples from more than 28,000 randomly selected dialysis patients across the United States who had blood drawn in July. According to the sample, only 8 percent of patients tested had formed COVID-19 antibodies, a figure that translates to 9.3 percent when standardized to the U.S. adult population.
“Most modeling estimates say that we need to get to about 60 or 70 percent of antibody levels in the population,” said Shuchi Anand, the study’s lead author and assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University Medical Center. “Based on natural infection alone, we’re not there.”
William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said in a Sept. 25 USA Today article that the study confirms the outbreak in the spring was “ridiculously” underestimated.
“We expect small-town America not to be in the first surge," Hanage, who was not an author on the study, told USA Today.
Normally, researchers would have carried out “community surveys,” knocking on doors and asking if residents would partake in the study. Instead, they obtained free leftover blood plasma from dialysis patients from their industry partner, a commercial laboratory.
The researchers said they believe dialysis patients provide necessary representation for elderly people in addition to racial and ethnic minorities — populations that have experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 infection. Non-Hispanic Black patients had the highest antibody rates at 9.5 percent, 6 percent higher than non-Hispanic white patients; Hispanic patients saw a rate of 6.3 percent.
“We reach a lot of minorities because they are part of our population,” co-author Maria E. Montez Rath said. “And that’s exactly the population that we would want to target more because we know they have had higher rates of COVID.”
In addition to their overall estimate, the researchers noticed a difference in minority groups' antibody rates. The rate of antibody prevalence was lower in older populations than in younger people, the researchers found, while ethnic minority group members were two to four times more likely to have COVID antibodies. The dialysis patient demographic is different to that of the U.S. population, with a greater proportion of older people and ethnic minorities.
Eli S. Rosenberg, an associate professor at University at Albany, estimated the COVID antibody rates in New York in April and weighed in on the difficulties of using residual serum as opposed to traditional sampling methods and the results.
“What's really cool about it is it’s almost every state,” Rosenberg said. “You have more challenges in terms of assuring the representativeness of the sample.”
He added that though the group’s number was probably a “high-end estimate,” their figures still fell “well below” herd immunity.
The group is already trying to answer more questions about COVID-19 by continuing to track their sample group. Dialysis patients must undergo blood draws at least once a month, allowing the researchers to make estimates on how long antibodies remain in the body and how many new COVID cases they have per month.
“Being far away from herd immunity really means that we do need to think at the population level, we do need to think about what can be done, so that we can really protect the vulnerable populations that are most affected by the disease,” Montez Rath said.

At a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Wednesday, Harvard representatives presented the University’s annual report on projects affecting the Allston neighborhood, including the Enterprise Research Campus and the Harvard Ed Portal.
The Task Force met Wednesday to discuss the University’s involvement and various programming areas, including the Allston-Brighton Winter Market and youth mentoring through the Harvard Ed Portal. The meeting — hosted over Zoom by the Boston Planning and Development Agency — included BPDA staff, Harvard-Allston Task Force members, and University staff.
The Task Force was formed in 2006 as an advisory group to the Boston Redevelopment Authority aimed at providing feedback on issues regarding Harvard’s planning and development in north Allston and north Brighton.
Gerald Autler, senior project manager and planner at the BPDA, said the merger has expanded the Task Force's role.
“We thought it made sense to have this group look holistically at kind of everything happening to the east of north Harvard streets on Harvard lands,” Autler said. “As we move forward community benefits is also a key piece of what this group has done and will continue to do.”
Mark Handley, director of community relations for the University, discussed the “unusual” nature of this year’s annual report and read a quote from University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
“This annual report is so unusual, because it was quite a normal year up until March when things completely fell off the rails, and we had to reorganize how we do things at Harvard University and how we do our community benefits,” Handley said.
“So, Larry wrote, ‘In the midst of a global pandemic, the importance of local community cannot be overstated,’” he added.
Handley also updated the Task Force on construction and project updates, such as the Enterprise Research Campus and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which he said they are hoping to open in a “very big and exciting way in 2021.”
SEAS will begin moving into the Science and Engineering Complex in Allston during the first week of November, the school announced last month.
Some attendees raised concerns that there was not enough time allocated for community feedback at the event.
“I suppose it was appropriate to have Harvard since we haven't met for so long, and since the task force sort of disintegrated — to have an extensive overview of what Harvard did,” Bruce E. Houghton, a task force member and the president of Allston-based industrial company Houghton Chemical, said at the meeting. "But once again, I think it shortchanges the community and the Task Force.”
“I'd like to see a new meeting soon with a chair and have the community dominate the meeting,” he added.
Autler responded that three weeks “may be a little unrealistic” and suggested they “get a few meetings under [their] belt” before deciding whether to have a chair.
“There's a lot happening in the neighborhood, and we're trying to be mindful of the community's time and ability to participate in meetings,” he said.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, another task force member and president of the Allston Civic Association, said he hopes residents will have more input on future decisions.
“We talked about getting together and making these decisions about how to proceed — I don't think there was any community members sitting there listening and providing their input,” he said. “I hope this task force does not follow the path taken by previous ones.”
“I hope that we make some fundamental changes here, so that the community can be reassured that their voices are being heard,” he added.
Autler said there are “lots of opportunities to participate.”
“It was never my understanding that anybody had thought of this group as being a group to advise us on every piece of Harvard property in the neighborhood — that was never the mission,” Autler said.
D’Isidoro told The Crimson Thursday the Task Force needs to better define its mission.
“Harvard, the BPDA, Task Force members, and the community — we need to have a shared vision of what the Harvard-Allston Task Force is all about,” he said. “Let's establish a circle of trust among the four groups and let's proceed and do some good work that everybody's going to benefit from. That's the whole goal of all this.”

Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital upgraded VirScan — an antibody-detecting technology — to identify signs of infection from coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.
A paper published on Sept. 29 describes a new update enabling VirScan to detect coronaviruses. Harvard Medical School professor Stephen J. Elledge said the upgrade may help scientists better understand the body’s immune response to the disease and ultimately design effective vaccines.
“We basically had this technology that had, in the past, been really useful for analyzing antibody response to viruses,” said Eric Fujimura, co-first author of the paper and a graduate student in the Elledge Lab. “It was a pretty obvious step to try to apply that to the pandemic.”
VirScan technology works by fusing DNA from over 1,000 viral strains that make peptides — short protein segments — with bacteria-infecting viruses called bacteriophages.
Human blood contains antibodies, which are produced by the immune system to fight disease. By detecting which antibodies bind with which bacteriophages, VirScan can identify someone’s entire viral infection history through a drop of blood.
After the RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses were released, the researchers were able to add them to the existing VirScan library and effectively diagnose the disease.
VirScan offers far more information than existing COVID-19 antibody diagnostics, like an ELISA test, which only checks for the presence of a few antibodies specific to a disease.
“You really just say ‘yes or no’ for those, but you don’t really have the detail that you get through VirScan,” Fujimura said.
In fact, the COVID-19 diagnostic tests produced by VirScan “performed similarly and even a little bit better than ELISAs,” according to Ellen L. Shrock, another co-first author of the paper and a graduate student in the Elledge Lab.
The team also further analyzed and compared antibody responses and prior viral infections in hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
“What we found is that the people who go to the hospital make way more antibodies than the people who stay home,” Elledge said.
VirScan might also ultimately help with vaccine development.
“Rapid testing of a vaccine and seeing which types of antibodies result from giving that vaccination could be very useful,” said Rachel Bender Ignacio, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Washington.
Researchers could put the effective antigens into a vaccine and take out those that are ineffective or even distracting to the body’s immune response.
“If we can find the antibodies that bind these peptides that are reoccurring, we can then study them and say, ‘What kind of antibodies are they? Are they neutral antibodies? Are they neutralizing antibodies? Or are they bad antibodies?’” Elledge said.
“The study team found some really provocative data,” said Joshua A. Hill, an assistant professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “This is a great foundation to launch a lot of other targeted studies.”

COVID-19 results in higher case numbers and mortality rates in men than women across age groups, a recently released review article from Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center showed.
Led by HMS Assistant Professor of Medicine Vaishali R. Moulton, the Frontiers in Immunology study analyzed sex-based physiological differences in COVID-19’s effect.
Moulton, alongside co-authors and Boston University medical students Nirupa Gadi, Samantha C. Wu, and Allison P. Spihlman, stated that the roots of this sex-based difference may include pre-existing determinants such as the increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in men compared to women. Additional behavioral variables, such as the tendency of men to smoke more than women, may also contribute to disparate COVID-19 risk, the study explained.
Beyond those social and environmental factors, the review also highlighted a variety of biological variables underlying divergent immune responses between sexes. Such factors include differences in microbiome control, sex hormones, and sex chromosome-linked genes.
One such gene is ACE2, a receptor that the virus binds to as a mechanism of entering host cells. Variable expression of ACE2 may result in higher viral susceptibility in men compared to women, which could lead to differential clinical outcomes, the review explained.
Additionally, estrogen –– the primary female sex hormone –– contributes to increased bacteria presence, specifically in the gastrointestinal tract. These gut microbiota may underlie the improved immune response of women compared to men.
The study ultimately concluded that sex is an understudied yet vital component in research relating to immunity and infectious disease, including COVID-19.
The authors called for a greater consideration of sex in future research, specifically pointing to implications for vaccine dosage and other protective immunity strategies.
“Vaccine-related research and clinical trials, including those currently underway for COVID-19, must include sex as a key variable when measuring and reporting outcomes,” they stated in the review.
Assistant Professor of Surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital Anahita Dua, who is unaffiliated with the study, commented on the significance of the findings.
“I commend the authors for looking into this. We really need to figure out how we can target our therapies to best serve patients that are the most likely to get severe and potentially die,” Dua said. “As people continue on their quest to figure out COVID, they do give a little bit more focus onto the male-female aspect.”
Dua said that while the exact reasons for the sex-based difference in mortality rates are still unclear, future studies can continue to examine the relationship between biological sex and COVID.
“This highlights yet another piece that may be part of this jigsaw puzzle that is COVID,” Dua said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John L. Hennessy, chairman of Alphabet and former president of Stanford University, affirmed his faith in the next generation of leaders to confront mounting crises in Thursday’s annual Godkin lecture.
“We have difficult problems, but we have really great people and we have a great young generation,” Hennessy said. “All of us that are in the education field, if we can help prepare these young people, we can solve these problems.”
The Godkin lecture series honors Edwin L. Godkin, founder of the liberal magazine The Nation. The Kennedy School has hosted the lectures each year since 1903.
“Public duty can be exercised in many ways, and we use the Godkin Lecture to help students learn about the possibilities,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email to The Crimson. “The most recent Godkin lecturers — Gina Raimondo and Eric Holder — did their public duty through roles in government, while this year’s lecturer — John Hennessy — did his public duty through his scientific research and university leadership.”
Hennessy's lecture, “There and Back Again: Leadership Lessons from the Farm to Silicon Valley,” was held as a Zoom webinar after being postponed from Mar. 11.
David R. Gergen, the founding director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, invited Hennessy and moderated the Godkin lecture. The two discussed the foundations of strong leadership, the role of higher education in fostering those values, and the power students have to empathize and make change.
The lecture opened with Hennessy stressing that strong leadership is needed to face the challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, economic turmoil, racial injustice, climate change, and the upcoming presidential election.
Conversation turned from global problems to a solution Hennessy has dedicated himself to since retiring from the Stanford presidency in 2016 — the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program at Stanford University. The scholarship is designed to train world leaders in government, business, and nonprofits. Admitted scholars study at Stanford’s graduate schools while participating in the program, which focuses on fostering collaboration and leadership qualities, namely humility, authenticity, and empathy.
“I’ve always believed that leadership is something you learned by climbing the ladder one rung at a time,” Hennessy said. “We try to build those kinds of experiences.”
During the question session which followed the lecture, Harvard students focused on current issues such as political polarization, online misinformation, and race relations in the U.S. Hennessy offered some ideas on how to combat these problems but emphasized there was no clear solution.
Still, Hennessy said he remains optimistic because of the empathy of rising leaders. Young leaders are willing to rethink problems and work across traditional boundaries like race and occupation because they are exposed to more diverse communities, Hennessy said.
“You can sense a feel that young people are willing to work problems which perhaps some of the older generation are willing to ignore,” he said.
He added that colleges are excellent places to foster leadership since they provide an intellectual environment for young people to gather and learn from each other. Educators’ goal, Hennessy said, should be to help and guide young leaders by exposing them to different viewpoints and opportunities.
“It’s my core purpose now,” Hennessy said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Moving from serves on Cambridge tennis courts to servers on the Internet, the College’s intramural sports program transitioned online for the fall semester.
Upperclassmen at Harvard can participate in the House Intramural Program, in which all 12 Houses and the Dudley Co-op compete in sports and vie for the annually-rewarded Straus Cup. First-year students participate in a separate intramural league for the Yard Trophy.
As courses and extracurriculars have adapted to virtual and distance settings this semester, so too have the intramural program’s offerings.
Jerome M. Edwards ’21, the head referee of the intramural program, said the program began piloting online activities last spring when courses first moved online.
“We held a trivia event that was pretty popular. And then we tried something new with eSports where we partnered up with HeSPA, which is the Harvard eSports Association, and we ran a rocket league tournament throughout the houses,” Edwards said.
Edwards said the IM program has recreated the annual River Run experience this fall — by having participants time a two-mile run using a mobile app — and launched a new eSports league with six games: Fortnite, NBA 2k20, Rocket League, FIFA, Smash Bros Ultimate, and Madden.
He said participation in River Run increased from previous years, with 220 runners compared to 80 to 100 in prior semesters. The junior class had the lowest rates of participation out of the four class years, according to Edwards.
“What I've noticed is that the sophomores right now are looking for ways to build community, because they sort of missed that in their second half of their freshman year. I am a little bit more concerned about the junior class,” Edwards added. “There might be less impetus to go out and find new opportunities because they've already begun to experience it.”
Alexander A. Carras, the recreation programs and club sports coordinator, said that because it has expanded to non-athletic events, he hopes the IM program can be an outlet for all students.
“I can't stress enough the importance of the mental break and the positive effects that this physical movement or social engagement can have for students who are pretty much dealing with everything virtually,” Carras said.
Still, some students said they have had a difficult time connecting with a wide group of classmates through virtual intramurals. Daniel R. Brunnick ’22, IM representative for Cabot House, said participation for his House has been relatively sparse. He estimated that roughly four people turn out for each event, typically those already active in Cabot’s House Committee.
“I'll see the same few people, like the same small handful of people, when we do virtual events,” he said. “I definitely have continued with intramurals because I'm passionate about supporting Cabot, but it's just it's definitely tough to do events where people don't show up.”
Israel A. Perez ’23 — who participated in the River Run —said he appreciated the effort put into coordinating IM events like River Run in a remote environment.
“In a way, we are still trying to be a team,” Perez said. “I guess it’s the thought and effort that counts, especially for this, the River Run.”
Despite the online format, houses will still compete for the Straus Cup. The aspect of competing for a prize could potentially increase participation, according to Eliot IM representative Michael D. Wu ’22.
Carras said ensuring equitable access to intramural activities was a key concern when organizing this year’s activities.
“We're trying to connect the students all over the globe: we have to be cognizant of what they're dealing with in their home countries, their home states and towns, maybe restrictions they have to deal with,” Carras said. “Whatever offerings we put out there, just make sure that it is open to all students and if not, offer alternative programming that might supplement something that a student can not do.”
Edwards said the intramural committee has already planned multiple events for the remainder of the semester including trivia competitions, a spelling bee, an online chess tournament, and a running mileage competition. He also said the IM program will host a scavenger hunt in which students can participate from any location.
Regardless of how programs perform this semester, Carras says the organizers will work improve future IM offerings.
“Just like everything in the world right now, we are adapting and changing,” Carras said. “So even if things revert back to our traditional IMs, we will take a lot of what was successful here and continue to do it.”

Harvard Medical School researchers created a machine learning model which may help diagnose and predict dementia in older adults, according to a study published last Monday in the open-access medical journal JAMA Network Open.
The researchers' brain age index is derived from a machine learning algorithm that analyzes brain waves during different stages of sleep and models normal brain activity across the human lifespan, according to M. Brandon Westover, an assistant professor of neurology at the Medical School who supervised the research.
First author Elissa M. Ye, a data scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital who works in Westover’s lab, said patients with dementia tend to have brain activity that appears “older” than the patient’s chronological age.
“The brain age index is basically the brain age subtracted by the chronological age,” Ye said.
A high brain age index is "a great indicator of accelerated aging,” she added.
The study relies on 9,834 polysomnograms — records of brain waves, blood oxygen levels, heart rates, respiration, and muscle movements during sleep — collected by the Sleep Laboratory of Massachusetts General Hospital between 2009 and 2017.
“We are equipped with the world's largest sleep dataset,” Haoqi Sun, an instructor at Harvard Medical School who contributed to the study, said. “It's always growing.”
Westover said the team hopes the brain age index — in combination with other screening tools — can act as an “early warning system” for dementia and other neurological conditions.
In 2014, an estimated five million adults over the age of 65 suffered from dementia. That number is projected to reach nearly 14 million by 2060. A recent study suggests 61.7 percent of dementia cases go undiagnosed.
“There's a great diagnostic gap,” Ye said. “There's no really, really good, state-of-the-art, official way to diagnose dementia in the early stages. Usually, it's really hard to even conclude that someone has dementia, even when they're in the later stages.”
Westover also pointed to applications in testing the efficacy of preventative therapies and medicines.
“I'm thinking things like exercise or meditation,” he said. “There's actually a bunch of crazy things that people are trying that may actually work, like playing certain kinds of sounds that are time-locked to the brain activity that you have, or flashing lights in your eyes at a certain frequency.”
Unlike past algorithms of its kind — which require “expensive” and “cumbersome” procedures like lumbar puncture or magnetic resonance imaging — the brain age index can be measured at home using “easy-to-wear hats” that measure brain activity during sleep, according to Westover and Sun.
Sleep-tracking apps are popular on the Apple Store and Google Play Store, though Westover said more research is needed before his team’s algorithm will be ready for consumer or clinical applications. The next step on that road, he said, is removing the problem of night-to-night variability in brain activity, which he believes can be solved by averaging an individual’s brain age index over a period of multiple nights.
The team plans to use the algorithm to examine the effects of exercise on brain health and cognitive performance, he added.
“We're hoping to show that you can actually, by exercising, make your brain younger,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scholars discussed the history of scientific racism and abolition through the lens of a new book on slave daguerreotypes in a panel hosted by the Radcliffe Institute Thursday afternoon.
Radcliffe hosted the panel in partnership with the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. Entitled “The Enduring Legacy of Slavery and Racism in the North,” it was moderated by professor Tiya A. Miles '92 and featured Executive Director of Royall House and Slave Quarters Kyera Singleton, University of Connecticut professor Manisha Sinha, and Harvard English professor John W. Stauffer as panelists.
The discussion focused on a new book, titled “To Make Their Own Way in the World: The Enduring Legacy of the Zealy Daguerreotypes.” Panelists examined the ways scholars historically have used daguerreotypes to reinforce polygenism — a debunked evolutionary theory of racial difference.
Louis Agassiz, a famous Harvard professor of Zoology and proponent of polygenism in the mid 1800s, was a central figure in the talk. To search for physical evidence of polygenism, Agassiz commissioned Joseph T. Zealy in 1850 to capture fifteen daguerreotypes portraying people of African descent enslaved in South Carolina by the names of Alfred, Delia, Drana, Fassena, Jack, Jem, and Renty.
The panel’s renewed attention on the Zealy daguerreotypes comes during an ongoing lawsuit demanding that the University return the daguerreotypes to Tamara K. Lanier, who says she is a descendant of Renty and his daughter Delia.
Boston was a hotbed of abolitionism but was home to relatively few African Americans, Stauffer said in an interview Tuesday.
“Agassiz obviously spent virtually no time around African Americans, he didn't know them at all. So he's judging them. He's assessing them from a distance,” Stauffer said.
“As a scientist, it's important not to lose sight of your humanity when you are immersed in the science,” he added.
Black abolitionists not only worked to end slavery in the United States, but also to “redefine freedom” itself, Singleton said.
“Although slavery existed in Massachusetts, and then the North more generally, we often celebrate and talk about the North legacy of abolitionism, a story that often, too often, is actually about white abolitionism in particular,” she said.
The panelists also discussed current scholarship focused on centering Black stories in American history. Singleton spoke about her work with the Royall House and Slave Quarters, contextualizing the lives enslaved people led within the mansion. The Royalls were a wealthy Boston family who enslaved 64 people; Isaac Royall, Jr. endowed the first professorship at Harvard Law School.
Between 1999 and 2001, archaeologists discovered game pieces and smoking pipes associated with enslaved people on the historical property.
“That has allowed us to begin to tell a complex story about how enslaved people experienced not only enslavement, but also leisure, and how they made a life for themselves amidst the brutal violation of slavery,” Singleton said. “These objects have helped us reinterpret the site, and to think through hard questions of agency and resistance while centering the lives of those who were enslaved.”
The interracial American abolitionist movement inspired succeeding movements for gender equality and overlapped with pacifism and utopian socialism — a legacy that can inspire today’s activists during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinha said in an interview Wednesday.
“The abolitionists did it in circumstances that were even worse when 90 percent of the black population was enslaved. The Civil Rights Movement did it,” Sinha said. “And I think it's up to us now, and the younger generation of Americans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company’s natural resources team spun out into an independent investment firm, according to a message CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar sent to HMC affiliates Thursday.
Colin Butterfield, HMC’s former natural resources chief, will head the new firm, Solum Partners.
The split marks a milestone in Narvekar’s five-year plan to restructure the University’s investments. The natural resources team was the only remaining group of employees managing an asset class internally.
In his message to affiliates, Narvekar praised Butterfield’s work at HMC, where he has worked since 2016.
Under Butterfield’s leadership,“the NR team immediately developed a robust set of sustainable investing guidelines to ensure that those tasked with operating our investments act as responsible stewards of the environment, their employees, and the communities in which they operate,” Narvekar wrote.
In his message Tuesday, Narvekar cited two justifications for the outsourcing.The move allows HMC to retain exposure to desirable aspects of its natural resources portfolio, while providing the investment team with “a pathway for growth,” he wrote.
Narvekar noted that Harvard will “continue to work closely” with the team at Solum as investors and advisors on the management and sale of the University’s remaining natural resources assets.
Harvard maintains the largest University endowment in the world. In a memo last week, Narvekar announced that the endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments for FY2020, bringing its value to a record $41.9 billion.
Narvekar has long sought to decrease the University’s investments in natural resources, an “illiquid asset” that yielded persistent low returns. He wrote that HMC had decreased its investments in natural resources during his tenure from 9 to 4 percent of overall investments.
Despite those efforts, in 2019, Harvard returned negative 12.4 percent on its investments in natural resources, marking the lowest returns of any asset class. At the time, Narvekar blamed the illiquid assets for “disappointing” overall returns for the endowment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf addressed student calls for increased diversity and more comprehensive financial aid in an interview Tuesday.
The Kennedy School has long been plagued by diversity issues, as evidenced by the school’s annual demographic reports. Over the three years since the first report was published, the Kennedy School has significantly increased the share of students and faculty who identify as racial and gender minorities. Still, the school remains overwhelmingly white and male.
To address this imbalance, Elemendorf said, the Kennedy School is reimagining the school’s recruitment strategy and hiring a new assistant dean.
“We hired a year or so ago, a new assistant dean to oversee our recruiting and admissions process, somebody with experience in broadening and strengthening admissions pools,” Elmendorf said. “This is the first year in a sense to see whether those strategies that we've deployed to the school are making a difference. And I think that they have been.”
This year, the Kennedy School also implemented an intensive two-week course on the history of race and inequality. The module is required by some programs, such as the mid-career master in public policy program.
This was the first year the Kennedy School  this course, which Elmendorf said he believes went “very well.” But he said he is unsure whether it will be required for all students.
“Most of the other programs at the Kennedy School don't have required courses,” Elemendorf said.
“It's a very important course. But we have to see now how that worked, and to think about what the best way is to expand that learning to students in other programs,” he added.
Some affiliates have alleged the Kennedy School does not foster a comfortable environment for students and faculty of color. Elmendorf said he is conducting remote discussions with new faculty members to ensure they feel supported.
“The first question I put to these new faculty members is, what can I do to help you find this place to be the best possible place they can work,” he said.
Elmendorf said he is “always sorry” to hear stories of people who don’t feel as though the Kennedy School’s environment is welcoming.
“The ongoing role of the dean is to draw faculty members and students to a school and then provide an environment in which they can thrive,” Elmendorf said. “I take that seriously for all of the students, and all the faculty, and all the staff members of the Kennedy School.”
The dean also discussed obstacles to offering more significant scholarships.
In the past, students at the Kennedy School have called to establish a need-based financial aid system that would replace the current merit-based system. Elmendorf said that while increasing financial aid has been a “priority” for him, the school “does not have the resources” to meet all of its students’ needs.
“We work very hard to persuade donors to the Kennedy School that one of the key ways they can make better governance in the future is to enable talented people without the means today to come to the school, to graduate without a huge amount of debt, so they can go easily into public service,” he said. “We try to distribute [the aid] across people in the best way we can, and there isn’t enough to go around.”
“I know that, and I’m doing my best to try and change that,” Elmendorf added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Common Application announced plans Sept. 30 to remove a question asking college applicants to self-report disciplinary actions taken against them in high school, a move that experts on higher education say will make the college admissions process more equitable.
The Common App dropped the question after it conducted research finding that Black applicants reported disciplinary infractions at more than twice the rate of white applicants.
“We want our application to allow students to highlight their full potential. Requiring students to disclose disciplinary actions has a clear and profound adverse impact,” Common App CEO Jenny Rickard said in a press release. “Removing this question is the first step in a longer process to make college admissions more equitable.”
The Common App also cited external research finding that Black and low-income students are, on average, disciplined more harshly for the same infractions when disciplined alongside white students.
Russell J. Skiba, a psychology professor at Indiana University, said he supported the Common App’s decision, saying it would help lessen racial inequities in college admissions and systemic racism more broadly.
“I just think this is a courageous act on the part of the Common App, when an institution looks at itself and says, ‘you know, here is something that is potentially disadvantaging a group’ and takes affirmative action to remove that,” Skiba said. “I think it’s the kind of actions that address and hopefully put an end to systemic racism.”
Jonathan N. Mills, a researcher at the University of Arkansas whose report the Common App cites, said the research on school discipline is significant for the striking disparities it reveals.
Black students and low-income students “were more likely to experience longer suspensions than their white, non-poor counterparts, and that is a concern,” according to Mills.
The Common App’s decision is, in part, a response to concerns that many high school students that choose to disclose their disciplinary record end up forgoing their college applications entirely.
The question will no longer appear by default on the Common App starting with the 2021-2022 application cycle. Universities will still be able to ask students about disciplinary records in supplemental questions, however.
Two years ago, the Common App also removed a question asking about previous criminal records. Since then, roughly 50 percent of colleges using the application service, including Harvard, have added the question back into their specific supplemental questions.
Dana N. Thompson Dorsey, an education and law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said she believes the Common App’s decision to drop the disciplinary action question is not enough to create an equal playing field for students of color.
For example, Dorsey believes that Harvard and other schools around the country would have to place less weight on standardized tests in order to achieve greater diversity and equality in their applicant pools.
“That's just one aspect of what contributes to a more diverse applicant pool and those who matriculate. There's also the issue of SATs on the undergraduate level,” Dorsey said. “While that is still the primary focus for admissions committees, particularly at elite institutions like Harvard University, I think it's still being limited in terms of the racial and economic diversity of a student body.”
Kayla M. Patrick, a policy analyst at Education Trust, an advocacy organization that works to improve education outcomes for low-income students and students of color, echoed the idea that other areas in the admissions process need reform.
In addition to decreasing the role of standardized testing in admissions, Patrick believes reallocating funding to support students would gradually increase higher education opportunities for students from marginalized backgrounds.
“We are really calling for schools to invest in the support that students need to make that link to college,” Patrick said. “That means things like guidance counselors who can really support students as they navigate high school and make sure that they've taken the right courses, and also support them and really expose them to schools like Harvard, which many students haven't even heard of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center found that unsubstantiated concerns about widespread mail-in voter fraud in the 2020 election are mainly spread by high-ranking Republicans — including Donald Trump — and conventional media, according to a working paper released Oct. 2.
Harvard Law School professor Yochai Benkler and others analyzed “over fifty-five thousand online media stories, five million tweets, and seventy-five thousand posts on public Facebook pages which garnered millions of engagements.” They found that — contrary to conventional wisdom — social media played a secondary role in spreading disinformation, though they counted Trump’s Twitter account as a media source rather than as a social media account.
Benkler said he and the team hope their findings will help assure the legitimacy of this fall’s election.
He also said that the paper ought to make policymakers reconsider their assumptions about so-called “fake news.” They should renew their focus on traditional media sources, such as local television and syndicated articles, since most relatively apolitical voters rely on them, he added.
“You need to shift your frame towards these very non-sexy, non-tech outlets, given who their audience is and given that they’re really the only remaining persuadable audience,” Benkler said.
The report found that, of the viewers and readers of local media, between 15 to 20 percent believe voter mail-in fraud would be a major problem. Consumers of national sources like the New York Times or NPR were less likely to share those worries.
The report found that CNN, the Washington Post, Trump’s Twitter account, NBC, NPR and Politico — among others — played the largest role in spreading information about voter fraud.
The Berkman Klein team began studying information dissemination about a dozen years ago, publishing “on more specific topics, like intellectual property legislation,” according to Benkler. They moved to studying larger issues after the 2016 election, publishing an analysis of that election in 2018, and started focusing on mail-in voting this summer.
“It became clear to me that this one controversy, specifically on fraud related to mail-in ballots, was becoming the major disinformation campaign in the 2020 election, the one that was really potentially threatening voter participation,” Benkler said.
The report calls for a reevaluation of journalistic standards of objectivity, which, it argues, force reporters to be overly sympathetic to falsehoods stated by prominent figures.
Benkler said he views so-called “fact-checking columns,” separate portions of a newspaper debunking false claims, as unhelpful. He advocates instead for what he calls a “sandwich approach,” one in which journalists correct false statements in the same articles in which they originally reported them.
“That’s a way to stay true to the normative commitments of professional journalism without becoming replicators and reinforcers of the propagandists’ message,” he said.

Harvard Business School professor Srikant M. Datar, who currently serves as the school’s Senior Associate Dean for University Affairs, will become HBS’s next dean, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Friday.
Datar joined the Business School faculty in 1996. He has since served in a number of high-level administrative roles, including as a senior associate dean responsible for faculty recruiting, for faculty development, for executive education, for research, and currently for University affairs.
Before his time at the Business School, Datar, a native of India, received his bachelor’s degree at the University of Bombay. He later earned a postgraduate diploma in business management from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, as well as master’s degrees in statistics and economics and a Ph.D. in business from Stanford University. He has also served on the faculty at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration as well as the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
As a member of the faculty, Datar has played a role in developing several new academic programs for Business School students. He helped launch the school’s joint M.S.-MBA program in biotechnology and life sciences, as well as the M.S.-MBA in engineering sciences. His own research interests have spanned a wide range of fields, from cost management and control to design thinking and artificial intelligence.
Datar will replace current dean Nitin Nohria, who assumed the role in 2010. Nohria was originally set to step down in June; he later elected to extend his tenure by six months due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bacow praised Datar’s professional accomplishments and personal demeanor in a press release.
“He is a leading thinker about the future of business education, and he has recently played an essential role in HBS’s creative response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has served with distinction in a range of leadership positions over his nearly 25 years at HBS, while also forging novel collaborations with other Harvard Schools,” Bacow said.
“He is also a warm, generous, and thoughtful colleague and mentor — someone whose leadership experience, intimate knowledge of HBS, deep devotion to the institution, and talent for catalyzing constructive change all promise to serve the School and the University well, at a pivotal moment for business education,” Bacow added.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 credited Datar for his intimate understanding of the Business School.
“He consistently builds bridges across disciplines and organizations, he understands HBS’s challenges and opportunities, and he has his sights set firmly on its success in a time of disruptive change,” Garber said in the press release.
Datar said in the release that he was “equal measures humbled and honored” to become the school’s next dean.
“Harvard Business School is an institution with a remarkable legacy of impact in research, education, and practice. Yet the events of the past year have hastened our passage to an unforeseen future. I look forward to working with colleagues and friends of the School — including throughout Harvard, in our Boston community, and around the world — to realize our mission in what undoubtedly will be an exciting new era,” Datar said.
Datar will take the helm of the Business School at a time when it is publicly grappling with its history of racial and gender inequities. In September, the school launched an “Action Plan for Racial Equity,” which established a new role for a diversity officer, as well as committees that will seek to recruit Black students and faculty and promote anti-racist research.
The COVID-19 pandemic has likewise posed challenges for the Business School, which has struggled with declining revenues from its executive education programs. The Business School is the only one of Harvard’s 12 degree-granting schools currently offering in-person instruction.
Datar will begin his tenure on Jan. 1, 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Professor Charles M. Lieber filed a complaint against Harvard in Middlesex County Superior Court Friday morning, alleging that the University broke its contract by refusing to indemnify him for his criminal defense.
In January, Lieber was arrested on federal charges of making fraudulent statements to U.S. government officials who were investigating his funding sources. Federal officials alleged he misrepresented his affiliation with the Thousand Talents Program and failed to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
A federal grand jury indicted Lieber in June for making false statements; he pled not guilty. He was later charged in a superseding indictment with tax offenses related to the income he allegedly received from Chinese sources.
The lawsuit cites Harvard’s indemnification policy, which states, according to the complaint, that the “University shall indemnify a Qualified Person acting in a Covered Role … provided that no indemnification shall be provided under this policy with respect to any matter, act or omission determined to be outside of the scope of a Covered Role.”
The complaint states that Lieber submitted a request to the University on March 31, 2020, requesting indemnification and advancement of legal fees and expenses. Lieber wrote that he was a “Qualified Person” acting in a “Covered Role” at all times relevant to the federal charges filed against him.
However, University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp denied Lieber’s request via letters written in May and July, referring to exclusions in the indemnification policy, according to Lieber’s suit. Among others, Lapp referred to a clause excluding actions in which “the Qualified Person is adjudicated or determined not to have acted in good faith.”
Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that Harvard’s cooperation with the United States Attorney’s Office, through providing documents and making witnesses available, is illegal.
The lawsuit requests indemnification and defense cost advancement from the University.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the suit.

Let’s be honest, Zoom meetings are survival of the fittest. Ever wonder how that one person is always so perky and put together during lecture? We’ve been keeping our eyes out for the most wanted items to help us (probably) make it through that 9 a.m. lecture (or honestly any lecture at this point). Take it from us: stop waiting for life to give you lemons — Amazon yourself some lemons, make some lemonade, and do your pset in style.
Blue Light Glasses
First up on the list are the seemingly omnipresent blue light glasses. Do these actually help? No idea. Will they make you look smarter and hide those fresh out of bed eyes? Potentially. Are they in my Amazon cart right now? Absolutely. Take this as your sign to finally satisfy that curiosity wondering if you would look good in glasses.
Hot Spot
Let’s be honest, Harvard Secure (and really Zoom connection in general) is pretty much as unreliable as our education right now, and that’s saying something. Take matters into your own hands and invest in a personal hotspot! Perfect to get out of your room and catch that Zoom lecture from the outdoor oasis you’ve been eyeing from your window. Tbh not really sure how to get one of these — call your network provider? Bombard HUIT with emails?
Laptop Bed Desk
Can’t drag yourself out of bed to make it to class (a whole five feet away at your desk)? Trust me, we’ve all been there. From now on, bring class to you! This lap desk gives you the professional feel of a desk, within the comfort of your own very warm, very cozy bed. Never suffer the pain of getting out of bed again. While we cannot guarantee increased productivity, better grades, or that you will remain conscious during the lecture, we can guarantee that it is a game changer.
Warming Coaster
You’ve lost a lot of good coffee due to the speed of Zoom lectures. You take a sip, put it down to take notes, and your next sip is ice cold. No more. Take your coffee (or other hot beverage) back and keep it warm with these USB connected Mug Warmer Coasters! They’ll heat your drink and make your computer overheat at the same time, so I guess your coffee will be twice as hot?
The Perfect Zoom Outfit
Business casual, but make it ~pajamas~. Let everyone at least think you have your life (moderately?) together! Or even get festive and put on your Halloween costume a few weeks early — we linked some of our favorites for inspiration. Honestly, who even knows what reality is anymore, but at least you’ll look fantastic (from the waist up)!
Horse Head
Some days you wake up and just don’t feel camera ready, but that 5 percent participation grade isn’t worth the sacrifice. With this, you can roll out of bed ready to go! Yes, we woke up like this. You’ll be all set for lectures, those awkward breakout rooms, and are guaranteed at least one or two private messages. Gotta make friends on Zoom somehow!
Realistically will any of these make Zoom better? We’d say 60/40 odds. But in times like these, you gotta do what you gotta do and take matters into your own hands. Trust us on this one. Happy studying, and may the odds be ever in your favor in this world of Zoom.
