After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Why does nostalgia for childhood, or “the good old days” permeate so much of popular culture? Was it inherently a better time of life, or are we yearning for any deviation from our seemingly inescapable routine? Many forms of children’s media are described as timeless classics, much more so than the media adults consume.
There is no real adult analogue to the friendly cartoon faces that most of us watched and learned from every day in our youth and the deep memories of them that persist today. The lack of overarching plot displayed by children’s shows make them the perfect installation anytime, anywhere. There is never a need to catch up with what “Curious George” was up to last week before diving into a new episode. Conveniently, this means that the media can be reused for years, with generations of children. From the fantastical settings of many children’s shows to the deliberately vague settings of the likes of “Diary of a Wimpy Kid,” these narratives are decoupled from time passing in the real world.
Some aspects of the media are problematic at first glance. A character who speaks in an unnecessarily heavy accent and promotes racial stereotypes, for example, is low-hanging fruit for criticism. But what about the deeper messages that are so ingrained in our society that we cannot even notice them? The way that Thomas cheerfully answers Sir Topham Hatt’s every beck and call and the way that Greg Heffley’s father must sneak into the garage to snack, restricting his natural diet, are not conscious decisions. In our society, no one bats an eye at this behavior. The creators of these works subconsciously include these tendencies because they are simply what people do.
Harmful nuances baked into the foundations of series that began decades ago also persist without challenge in a way that is not seen in much of adult media. The idealization of capitalist labor baked into “Nancy Drew” and “Thomas and Friends” reflects the capitalist boom that occurred in the west in the 1930s and 40s as the work-centric structure of life developed rapidly. As time has passed, we have moved away from a world where this is accepted by all and begun to question it, yet long-lasting children’s media has ideas of the past entrenched within it. In adult life, some of the more ridiculous notions of children’s media may be challenged, but before new ways of thinking can be passed on to younger generations, they are exposed to the same messages that haven’t faltered in long-lasting media.
When messaging is so interwoven with the normal-seeming activity of lifelike characters, to change these aspects would be to change the characters themselves. Junie B. Jones wouldn’t be herself without constantly being reprimanded for her bold call-outs. We can’t easily take out aspects of capitalism from “Thomas and Friends,” because the trains’ worldview is built upon them — just like our society. Changing the subliminal messaging in these shows would require changing the societal backgrounds that lead to them.
There is no need to cancel certain shows for their messaging — if colonial American messages aren’t delivered by a spunky trio of Earthlings like in “Cyberchase,” casual statements made by teachers in a classroom will achieve the same end eventually. Instead, we must reframe the fabric of our society to move away from the idealization of hard labor for profit, restrictive diets, stifled kindergartners, and more. In much of children’s media, the real villain does not have as recognizable a form as The Hacker from “Cyberchase” and his Grim Wreaker. The true villain is the structure of our society itself which leaves fingerprints of the messages it gives children in their media. Children’s media does not contain more insidious messages than the rest of our society. They are simply easier to note when delivered by smiling cartoons. To resist the needling messages hidden in children’s media, we must reframe the way we think about our world from every angle. Maybe then, despite what Sir Topham Hatt might say, we would actually be “useful engines.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, as part of its annual Israeli Apartheid Week, The Harvard Palestinian Solidarity Committee mounted an artistic display between Thayer Hall and the Science Center Plaza promoting awareness of the immense suffering that Palestinians experience under Israel’s military occupation. Beneath the 12 paintings ran the messages “Free Palestine” and “Boycott, Divest, Sanction,” prompting the resurgence of a heated conversation about Zionism and antisemitism on college campuses.
Although the IAW display is no longer up, the same broadly-sweeping, aggressive talking points that characterize this conversation still echo around campus. Pro-Palestinian activists construct Israel as a malicious villain whose sole mission is to keep Palestinians in squalor, pulling out politically-loaded words like “genocide” and “Apartheid” from their inventory. Those quick to rush to Israel’s defense proclaim it as “the only true democracy in the Middle East” and immediately resort to disparaging the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, the condescending subtext of which regards the Palestinian people as unfit to govern themselves.
Yet it is not only the extremes that continue, year after year, to use the same talking points well after their potential to prompt productive dialogue has been exhausted. I tire, too, of having to hear the more “moderate” response that one can “criticize the Israeli government without rejecting the state itself.” Beyond carelessly disregarding the not-so-clear distinction between a state — especially one that purports to be a democracy — and its government, the issues in Israel run far deeper than the government that presently happens to be in power.
The recent history of the modern state of Israel has, irrespective of its government, been inextricably linked with the oppression of the Palestinian people. Though this is not necessarily inherent to the abstract notion of the state itself, such subjugation has characterized the Israeli state in reality. Since 1967, the West Bank has been under military occupation, a legal status that grants Israel functional control over the area while circumventing the obligation to grant Palestinians Israeli citizenship and the rights and privileges this designation would afford. After 50-plus years, I question whether “occupation,” a word which suggests transience, is even apt.
Accordingly, I don’t find it unreasonable that activists — or anyone concerned with justice, for that matter — would be morally outraged by the situation in Palestine. And I certainly don’t find it unreasonable to direct that outrage at something more fundamental than “the Israeli government.”
But our language matters — both out of respect for all parties involved and for the credibility of the person or organization expressing a political message. The way we go about discussing sensitive political topics, no matter the emotional fire they may stir up, therefore deserves careful scrutiny.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee’s display in the Yard says, “Zionism is racism, settler colonialism, white supremacy, and apartheid.” Putting aside the fact that “Zionism” is such a poorly-defined term that I’m not sure I really know what it even refers to anymore, it is these last two accusations that bother me most.
To accuse Israel of white supremacy is to ignore over half of the Israeli population of Mizrahi, Ethiopian, and mixed Jews for whom “white” remains a mischaracterization. It also ignores the fact that, until recently, whiteness was a category that all Jews were decidedly excluded from. I am Jewish, and given the shifting nature of whiteness, I acknowledge that I am also white, but I would be lying if I said it didn’t make me at all uncomfortable for accusations of white supremacy to be levied at Jews both alike and unalike me, whose shared history as victims of genocidal white supremacy remains fresh in our collective memory.
To accuse Israel of “Apartheid” in a colloquial sense — although recognizing that the term does have a technical definition under international law — is really to accuse Israel of perpetrating the same injustices of Apartheid South Africa. I understand that calling Israel an Apartheid state is meant to use the unambiguous injustice of South Africa as a frame of reference to convince people of egregious Israeli injustices and is not meant to posit a precise, one-to-one correspondence between Israel and South Africa. But Apartheid South Africa was a state where miscegenation was illegal and the law, which was directly derived from eugenics, regarded people of color as inferior explicitly and exclusively by virtue of their race. No law in Israel prohibits sex across racial lines, and though terrible discrimination absolutely exists in the state, it is not founded in racist notions of biological superiority. These are, I think, crucial distinctions to be made, lest we view Israel through a lens that incorrectly asseses the country’s history, making concepts associated with Apartheid seem more applicable than they really are.
Emotionally charged and inflammatory language like this succeeds in, justifiably, elevating the perceptual stakes of the issue at hand, but it conceals something important along the way: Something doesn’t have to be white supremacy or Apartheid for it to be bad. And what is happening in Israel, what has been happening in Israel for over 50 years, is really, really bad. Using phrases like “white supremacy” and “Apartheid,” however, cheapen the semantic weight these words legitimately hold and unfortunately misrepresent the unique complexities and conditions of today’s conflict.
Aside from sacrificing honesty for the sake of provocation, these words alienate students who, like me, are genuinely upset about and disillusioned by Israel’s decades-long disenfranchisement, displacement, and oppression of the Palestinian people. I hate to get caught up in semantics, but with conversations that hit close to home, the words we use really do matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When oppression strikes anywhere in the world, resistance movements reverberate globally. The desire for rightful justice spreads, like wildfire, moving us to act, to speak, to write, and right our past wrongs.
Over the past year, the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee has strived to do just that. Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Palestine, PSC has hosted informational programming, organized weekly demonstrations of support through “Keffiyeh Thursdays,” and even installed a colorful, multi-panel “Wall of Resistance” in favor of Palestinian freedom and sovereignty.
In at least one regard, PSC’s spirited activism has proven successful: It has forced our campus — and our editorial board — to once again wrestle with what both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called Israel’s “crimes against humanity” in the region.
We first and foremost wish to extend our sincere support to those who have been and continue to be subject to violence in occupied Palestine, as well as to any and all civilians affected by the region’s bellicosity. We are not sure how these words will reach you, or whether they’ll do so at all. But our stance isn’t rooted in proximity or convenience, but rather in foundational principles we must uphold — even if (or perhaps especially when) it proves difficult.
This editorial board is broadly and proudly supportive of PSC’s mission and activism, including its recent art display. The admittedly controversial panels dare the viewer to contend with well-established, if rarely stated, facts. They direct our eyes towards the property and land confiscations, citizenship denials, movement restrictions, and unlawful killings that victimize Palestinians day in and day out. Art is a potent form of resistance, and we are humbled by our peers’ passion and skill.
In the wake of accusations suggesting otherwise, we feel the need to assert that support for Palestinian liberation is not antisemitic. We unambiguously oppose and condemn antisemitism in every and all forms, including those times when it shows up on the fringes of otherwise worthwhile movements. Jewish people — like every people, including Palestinians — deserve nothing but life, peace, and security.
Nothing about PSC’s Wall of Resistance denies that. While members of our campus might well find its messages provocative, or disagree with their philosophical outlook, nothing about them is, in our view, worthy of that delegitimizing label. We have a certain community-wide tendency to dismiss opposing views as inherently offensive and unworthy, straw-manning legitimate arguments and obfuscating difficult but necessary discussions. Yet civil discourse and debate, even when trying, are fundamental steps towards a better reality.
Israel remains America’s favorite first amendment blindspot. Companies that choose to boycott the Jewish state, or otherwise support the pro-Palestine Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement face legal repercussions in at least 26 states. Even for journalists, openly condemning the state’s policies poses an objective professional risk. Only last year, the Associated Press prompted outcry after firing a news editor over college-age tweets critical of Israel. The controversial decision followed a long-established pattern: Dare question Israel’s policies or endorse Palestinian freedom and you will be shunned from the newsroom, past accomplishments or legitimate arguments be damned. For college students like ourselves, speaking bluntly about events in the region can prompt online harassment or even land you on a blacklist.
What this immense opposition to student activists and journalists makes clear is the overwhelming power imbalance that defines and constricts the ongoing debate. This stark power differential extends far beyond the arena of free speech, shifting from rhetorical to lethal on the ground in Palestine, where Israeli soldiers have killed nearly 50 Palestinians, including eight children, this year alone.
As an editorial board, we are acutely aware of the privilege we hold in having an institutional, effectively anonymous byline. Even on this campus, many of our brave peers advocating for Palestinian liberation can be found on watchlists tacitly and shamefully linking them to terrorism.
These twin factors — the extraordinary abuses and our privileged ability to speak to them and face comparatively less unjustified retribution — compel us to take a stand. Palestinians, in our board’s view, deserve dignity and freedom. We support the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction movement as a means to achieving that goal.
In the past, our board was skeptical of the movement (if not, generally speaking, of its goals), arguing that BDS as a whole did not “get at the nuances and particularities of the Israel-Palestine conflict.” We regret and reject that view. It is our categorical imperative to side with and empower the vulnerable and oppressed. We can’t nuance away Palestinians’ violent reality, nor can we let our desire for a perfect, imaginary tool undermine a living, breathing movement of such great promise.
Two decades ago, we wrote that divestment was a “blunt tool” that affected all citizens of the target nation equally and should be used sparingly. Yet the tactics embodied by BDS have a historical track record; they helped win the liberation of Black South Africans from Apartheid, and have the potential to do the same for Palestinians today. Israel’s current policy pushes Palestinians towards indefinite statelessness, combining ethnonationalist legislation and a continued assault on the sovereignty of the West Bank through illegal settlements that difficults the prospect of a two-state solution; it merits an assertive and unflinching international response. The arguments made against BDS could have been and indeed were once made against South Africa, and we are no longer inclined to police the demands of a people yearning to breathe free.
We do not take this decision lightly. BDS remains a blunt approach, one with the potential to backfire or prompt collateral damage in the form of economic hurt. But the weight of this moment — of Israel’s human rights and international law violations and of Palestine’s cry for freedom — demands this step. As a board, we are proud to finally lend our support to both Palestinian liberation and BDS — and we call on everyone to do the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard issued its first-ever green bonds — debt instruments that align with international sustainability standards — earlier this month.
The $250 million bonds will finance and refinance projects including Harvard’s newly-constructed Science and Engineering Complex, estimated to cost around $1 billion, along with the ongoing renewal of Adams House and renovation of Soldiers Field Park, which will cost at least $600 million combined.
The borrowing marks the first time an outside firm has verified the University’s compliance with the 2021 Green Bond Principles, a global framework that encourages environmental sustainability and development in debt capital markets.
The principles, set by the International Capital Market Association, “outline best practices when issuing bonds serving social and/or environmental purposes through global guidelines and recommendations that promote transparency and disclosure, thereby underpinning the integrity of the market,” according to ICMA’s website.
Sustainable measures for capital projects could include renewable energy, green equipment, energy-efficient transportation systems, and the usage of environmentally-friendly building materials.
The 544,000-square-foot SEC, which opened in fall 2021, received two environmental distinctions: the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum status — the highest distinction offered by LEED — and the Living Building Challenge Petal certification. To attain Petal certification, the SEC was monitored for a year and had to pass three sustainability performance areas, or “petals.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote that the borrowing is in line with Harvard's own sustainability goals.
“The purpose of the bond offering includes support for maintenance and investment in Harvard’s physical campus, including creating capacity for initiatives related to Harvard’s Climate Action Plan” he wrote.
Harvard’s climate action plan includes targets for campus operations to be fossil-fuel neutral by 2026 and fossil-fuel free by 2050. The University, however, has yet to release updated environmental targets after its first sustainability plan — announced in 2014 — lapsed last year.
The tax-exempt, 10-year bonds were verified by Kestrel Verifiers — a company that conducts external reviews for public finance projects — on April 6 and subsequently issued on April 20.
The bonds will close on May 17, 2022.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences launched a three-year strategic planning initiative in the fall to identify resources needed for “long-term excellence” in graduate education, faculty support and development, and academic divisions.
The strategic planning process draws from numerous planning efforts across the FAS and will include four academic steering committees and two administrative initiatives on budgeting and technology usage, according to an FAS webpage launched in early April.
The plan extends from the work of the FAS Study Group — a faculty group convened by FAS Dean Claudine Gay in November 2020 to examine the school’s “financial sustainability, organizational flexibility, and institutional resilience,” per a November 2021 statement from Gay.
The initiative also builds on group conversations hosted by the FAS for faculty to discuss the future of the school. The resulting vision statement for the strategic planning process calls for a “strong, intellectually vibrant, creative FAS.”
Four steering committees will lead the academic strategic planning efforts — one for each of the Divisions of Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences, one for faculty support and development, and one for graduate education and admissions. The committees are comprised primarily of faculty, along with several staff members and students.
The Division of Science will hold similar planning conversations within existing faculty structures, including its department chairs and divisional committees.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, Gay said the committees are in the beginning stages of their work.
“Those committees are assembled, and they’ve been charged and already, honestly, hard at work, mainly doing the information-gathering and taking the pulse of the community on the various issues,” she said.
In addition to academics, the FAS is launching two initiatives related to budgeting and technological support.
Scott A. Jordan, the FAS dean for administration and finance, will lead five different working groups dedicated to “reimagine budgeting.” According to the FAS webpage, the groups will tackle five topic areas — workforce planning, space and capital planning, multi-year planning, annual budgeting, and reporting and accountability measures — and draft recommendations to be implemented during the fiscal year 2024 budget process.
The working groups will launch their work in the next several weeks and will continue working during the summer and into the fall.
FAS Chief Information Officer Klara Jelinkova, who also serves as the vice president and university chief information officer, will lead a technology landscape study that will be overseen by an FAS steering committee. The study will assess and make recommendations on technology usage in the FAS.
Gay said in an interview that she has encouraged faculty to learn more about the committees and think about “what it means to build a school that really empowers us as teachers and scholars.”
Kristie T. La ’13, a Ph.D. candidate in History of Art & Architecture who serves as the graduate student representative on the arts and humanities steering committee, said the committee is still “early in the process” of their work.
“How can we organize the arts and humanities so that it can respond to the present and also be flexible enough for the future?” she said. “Many of these departments were created a really long time ago, with a really different student body, a very different history, a very different university overall, and obviously a completely different world.”
For the working group on graduate admissions and education, the goals include recommending changes that address the changing academic job market and stipend funding sources, per Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall. The FAS will use the information gathered to make adjustments in graduate admissions.

A team of researchers from Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals have developed genetic risk scores — which have the potential to aid screening and prevention in high-risk patients — for six common diseases and applied them clinically.
The study — published in Nature Medicine, a top peer-reviewed publication, on April 18 — was co-led by Harvard Medical School professors Jason L. Vassy and Matthew S. Lebo, and included researchers from HMS affiliates Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System.
The researchers analyzed the genomes of thousands of patients and developed polygenic risk scores, which use thousands of individual genes to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a given disease.
The methodology has widespread applications in detecting and preventing diseases, including common ones like atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer — the focus of the team’s study.
Vassy said polygenic risk scores could allow physicians to target the highest-risk patients for prevention and screening.
“I would say in the next 10 years, at least some polygenic risk scores of some shape and form will be regularly used,” he said.
Peter Kraft, a Harvard School of Public Health epidemiology professor and co-author, said the technique had previously been demonstrated in a research setting but was difficult to apply clinically.
“There’s no guarantee that what we saw in our research studies is going to work in a free-living human population,” he said.
Kraft said the team successfully proved the validity of their methods in a clinical setting, but still faced the challenge of helping physicians understand and implement polygenic risk scores in patient care.
“Primary care doctors in particular are just swamped these days — Covid notwithstanding — so they're not going to take a new genetics class or a new curriculum on polygenic risk scores,” Vassy said. “We wanted to be able to deliver the intervention in this research study in a very, very time-conscious way.”
Vassy said the use of polygenic risk scores in clinics also raises ethical concerns.
“The body of cohort studies in the world consists predominantly of European ancestry individuals, so these polygenic risk scores have been developed in those individuals,” Vassy said. “When you look at porting them over to cohort studies that consist of more diverse ancestry individuals, they don't perform as well.”
Anna C. F. Lewis, a research associate at Harvard's Safra Center for Ethics who co-authored the study, said while variance in the efficacy of polygenic risk scores is an “ethical problem,” the methodology should still be tested.
“The right thing to be doing is to test them and to measure how many of these concerns are in fact realized,” she said.
Kraft said enrolling more genetically diverse cohorts is the next step.
“The more diverse of a population we have to study, the better, because ultimately we would like to apply these scores and make sure they work for everybody equally well,” he said.
Correction: May 4, 2022
A previous version of this article misquoted Harvard School of Public Health epidemiology professor Peter Kraft. He said there is no guarantee what he found in research studies “is going to work in a free-living human population.” He did not say “pre-living human population.”

The Harvard College Women’s Center celebrated the 25th anniversary of its Women’s Leadership Awards, expanding the number of recipients from one to three graduating seniors.
Fariba Mahmud ’22, Oluremi F. Owoseni ’22, and Ruth H. Jaensubhakij ’22 were named this year’s recipients, along with Yanting Teng, a graduate student who received the adjacent Women in STEM Mentor of the Year Award. The Women’s Center hosted a celebratory event for the winners in Winthrop on April 22.
Established in 1997, the WLA celebrates female leadership on campus and has historically been awarded to a single senior student — until this year. Ananda M. Birungi ’24, one of the Women’s Center interns, helped push for the change from one winner to three.
“We don't want to send out this idea that leadership is an individual thing or there's one leader in our community,” Birungi said.
Birungi added the Center aimed to include a diverse set of student leaders from across campus.
Mahmud, a joint centrator in History and Literature and Classics, formerly interned at the Women’s Center and is former co-president of the Harvard South Asian Association. Owoseni, a Psychology concentrator, has worked closely with the Phillips Brooks House Association. Jaensubhakij, a Social Studies concentrator, spends most of her free time with the First-Year International Program and Peer Advising Fellows Program.
All three winners said they hope to foster a sense of belonging among students in their respective student organizations.
“What I devote my time around has always been around building community — whether that be in the South Asian community on campus, whether that be House committee, or whether that be for women and gender minorities on campus,” Mahmud said.
Owoseni said she plans to stay involved with PBHA after graduation, inviting future student leaders to call on her “at any point.”
“No matter what I move on to after this, I will always want to give back,” she said. “The way that PBHA does foster that community of love, people will keep coming back to it even after we graduate.”
Jaensubhakij praised Harvard's First-year International Program and the College's Peer Advising Fellow program for providing equitable paths to leadership for all members, regardless of gender.
“I think that's not true in every organization at Harvard, in every space,” she said. “So I feel very fortunate that I've been able to step into these leadership positions and do what I've been able to do without necessarily facing particular setbacks because of my gender.”
Owoseni stressed the importance of “leading with love” and approaching leadership roles with “positivity and compassion and grace.”
“It can be done: you can just always have grace and always be positive, even when times get hard,” she said.
All three women said they are proud of the impact they have achieved on campus.
“If my leadership or community building has been able to even impact one person to feel more included or to feel more at home on this campus, I would feel so honored,” said Mahmud.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The developers behind a proposed project at 52 Everett St. in Allston pitched their plans to build a new housing project at meetings hosted by the Boston Planning and Development Agency over the last two weeks.
The proposed development would be a part of the Allston Yards project, which will create a new neighborhood center in Allston. The project plans to create new housing, offices, and spaces for restaurants and businesses.
The 52 Everett St. development would be located alongside four buildings approved by the BPDA in December 2019 at 60 Everett St. that are still under construction. In March, the BPDA approved a different building project for Allston Yards located at 90 Braintree St. that will include rental residential units and artist live-work spaces.
The 52 Everett St. project, which is set to begin next spring, will take roughly 24 months to complete.
David P. Manfredi, an architect for the project, lauded the sustainability of the proposed building.
“We have a very highly insulated and very sustainable building envelope designed for reduced energy consumption,” Manfredi said.
Still, some residents said they were concerned about the proposal. Brighton resident Eileen K. Houben said she was concerned about the project’s impact on the electrical grid.
“We have lots of blackouts, at least in my neighborhood,” Houben said. “I was wondering what percentage of your power is going to be generated by you and not dependent on the grid.”
Other residents expressed support for the project and the role it would play in developing the Allston-Brighton area.
Owen Palmatier, a Brighton resident, voiced support for the project.
“I think this is a good project for us. I’m a Brighton resident and I’m also a Local 12 member,” he said, referring to the Boston plumbers and gasfitters union. “I think this would be good for the community — it would bring in a lot of money to the community.”
Local resident Paula Alexander lauded the project’s design.
“It’s an attractive looking building, I think, compared to some of the others in the area,” she said.
Housing prices in Allston have soared in recent years. The average home went up 43 percent between 2011 and 2019, and the median rent went up 36 percent, according to data compiled by the Boston Department of Neighborhood Development.
At the meeting, the developers discussed their efforts to promote affordable housing in the neighborhood.
“We’re accelerating our Allston Yards affordable commitment and that brings forward more affordable homeownership units, which is something that the neighborhood has been really vocal about and it’s important to the community,” said Mark Jackson, a project manager from New England Development, one of the development agencies behind the proposal.
The public comment period for the project will continue through May 6.

The City of Cambridge will spend nearly $22 million of federal funding on direct payments to low-income Cambridge families, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui announced Wednesday.
The money — allocated to Cambridge under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — will go toward expanding Cambridge Recurring Income for Success and Empowerment, or RISE, a guaranteed income pilot program championed by Siddiqui in her first term. This $22 million-dollar expansion will make RISE the third-largest direct income program of any city in the country, behind the $38-million BIG: LEAP basic income program in Los Angeles and a $31.5 million program in Chicago.
Siddiqui announced the program in the “State of the City Address,” broadcast virtually Wednesday afternoon.
“Particularly in light of the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which we know disproportionately affect low-income residents and residents of color, this historic allocation will help put families on a path to economic stability,” Siddiqui said in the address.
Last September, Cambridge RISE — a partnership with the city, the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee, and the national organization Mayors for a Guaranteed Income — began sending monthly $500 payments to 130 randomly selected low-income Cambridge households for 18 months.
Under the expanded program, all families in Cambridge with incomes below twice the federal poverty level will be eligible for 18 months of $500 payments. In a Thursday interview with the Crimson, Siddiqui estimated that roughly 2,300 families will qualify.
“There's been a big desire to move forward on expanding this type of support,” Siddiqui said in the interview. “I think families are looking for relief.”
This expansion also marks the single largest allocation of Cambridge’s ARPA funds to date. Under the federal law — signed by President Joe Biden in March 2021 — Cambridge was awarded $88 million in Covid-19 relief funding.
With this new allocation, the city will have roughly $33 million of ARPA funds remaining, which it plans to distribute among community organizations and nonprofits.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said in an interview she hopes other municipalities across the country will follow Cambridge’s lead in using ARPA funds to implement guaranteed income programs.
“Every single municipality across the country got these American Rescue Plan Act dollars, and they can allocate them pretty much however they like, as long as they fall within the ARPA guidelines,” Mallon said. “The gauntlet has been thrown.”
In the Wednesday address, Siddiqui echoed similar sentiments.
“This is the exact type of initiative that makes us all proud of Cambridge: a unique, forward-thinking anti-poverty program that will hopefully serve as an example to cities everywhere,” she said in the speech.
Correction: May 1, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Cambridge’s guaranteed income pilot program would be the second-largest basic income program in the United States. In fact, it would be the third-largest, behind Los Angeles and Chicago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All but one of Harvard College’s 12 upperclassman houses will place students in overflow housing next year thanks to the oversized Class of 2025.
Leverett House, the largest house at the College, is the only one that will not have to place upperclassmen into alternate buildings due to space constraints.
“Given the larger College population anticipated for Fall 2022 (due both to the large sophomore class, and the impact of students who took leaves of absence during the pandemic), the College has adjusted the housing arrangements so that we can continue to house as many students as possible,” Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt wrote in an email.
Some students assigned to houses located in the Radcliffe Quadrangle — Currier, Cabot, and Pforzheimer — will be placed in overflow housing at the Cronkhite Center, a former graduate student dormitory that was previously used for Covid-19 isolation.
“Cronkhite will be a mini-Quad next year,” Currier House Administrator Alana Brissette wrote in an email on March 27.
It is unclear where Quad students who live in Cronkhite will be assigned to eat. Brissette wrote that Currier students living in Cronkhite will keep their mailboxes in the Quad, but that information about dining locations is not yet available. The center has common kitchens on each floor.
“We do not have information about whether or not dining will be available in Cronkhite next year and this is a decision that will not be made at the House level,” Brissette added in a follow-up email on April 19.
Cronkhite is located on Brattle St., next to the Harvard Admissions offices.
Pforzheimer House will also continue to house students in the Jordans, apartment-style halls located behind Cabot House that are not connected to Pfoho’s main complex.
Overflow dorms currently used to house freshmen — the Inn at Harvard, the Prescotts, and 10 DeWolfe St. — will become additional spaces for some of the River Houses this coming school year.
Next fall will be the first time in recent years that several houses — including Eliot, Mather, Currier, and Cabot — will have to place students in overflow housing
Eliot House will house students in apartment-style overflow housing located at 22-24 Prescott St., House Administrator Susan G. Weltman wrote in an email last month.
Mather House — normally renowned for its guarantee that all students will get a single — will house roughly 70 students in suites with two double bedrooms at 10 DeWolfe St., a former apartment building.
“Mather normally has 400 students, but the large rising sophomore class means that Mather will have additional students for the next three years,” Mather Resident Dean Luke Leafgren wrote to residents on April 1. “Combining Mather proper and Mather overflow, Mather House will have bed space for 461 students, and every space is expected to be filled.”
Mather originally intended to place mostly rising juniors and seniors in DeWolfe, but reversed course after backlash from students.
“The students who wrote expressed the sadness they felt at this news, as well a sense of unfairness,” Leafgren said in an April 3 email. “It might feel unfair, when rising juniors have borne other impacts from the pandemic and may not have contributed to the housing shortage by taking a leave of absence or deferred enrollment along the way.”
For years, the DeWolfe apartments have acted as overflow housing for upperclassman students in various river houses. This year, students in Quincy, Leverett, Dunster, and Kirkland lived there. Starting in the fall, it will be home to some Quincy, Dunster, and Mather residents.
In 2012, the College launched its $1 billion House Renewal project to phase out the use of DeWolfe St. units as overflow housing, allowing all undergraduates to live in their affiliated houses. Three years later, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana said the schools planned to phase students out of DeWolfe as house renewal progressed.
Adams House is currently under renovation while Winthrop, Lowell, and Dunster were previously overhauled. Parts of Leverett and Quincy were also renewed, but students from both of those houses lived in DeWolfe this year.
In the coming school year, Winthrop House will use Fairfax Hall as overflow housing. A portion of Lowell House students will live in Ridgley Hall.
“The College will be continuing to evaluate our housing needs and demands in the years to come and making adjustments accordingly, in tandem with the ongoing House Renewal projects,” Brandt wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No. 14 Harvard secured its 30th Ivy League title in an impressive 4-0 victory over Yale on Sunday, Apr. 24. The sweep concluded the Crimson’s undefeated conference record for the season and marks their first outright win since 2008.
“We came out and played really good tennis, and I’m really, really proud of what we’ve been able to achieve,” said senior captain Brian Shi, who played in the #2 position.
Doubles proved to be a deciding factor in the match, with Harvard winning two of three matches in tiebreakers to get the doubles point. At one point, Yale was leading on all three courts, but after seeing the loss on Court 2, the Crimson dug deeper to get the win. The duo of Shi and Milavsky on Court 1 defeated Cody Lin and Renaud Lefevre, 7-6 (7-4), taking it all the way to a tiebreaker. Two courts down, Steven Sun and Henry von der Schulenburg secured a similarly thrilling win over Michael Sun and Luke Neal, 7-6 (7-3).
“We [Shi and Milavsky] were also down early, but I knew once we got one break back the momentum was gonna be on our side,” Shi recalled after the match. “When a crowd is out there I think it’s really kind of impossible to not bring the energy, so honestly I think [the crowd’s energy] really kept us in the doubles match.”
Doubles strategy has been a focus of the coaching team throughout the season, and seeing as the Crimson took the doubles point in every conference match, the tactics are working. The Scott Mead ‘77 Head Coach for men’s tennis, Andrew Rueb ’95, has worked extensively with the team on doubles plays throughout the season.
“A point margin going into singles seems small, but it’s actually a big advantage, and I think that also puts a lot of pressure on Yale to be perfect,” Rueb explained.
The pressure worked: Yale was unable to win a single match against Harvard in singles play. Ronan Jachuck made quick work of his match on court 4, beating Aidan Reilly 6-0, 6-2. Next to finish was Steven Sun, whose competition against Walker Oberg resulted in a similarly decisive 6-2, 6-1 win.
“It takes a lot to win four singles matches against us,” Coach Rueb said. “It’s not only a talented team, but it’s also a really gritty team, and that’s what’s been separating this year from some others.”
After the victories on Courts 4 and 5, the Crimson found itself up 3-0 in the competition, needing just one more point to close it out. It all came down to Shi.
“In the back of my mind I was thinking ‘Oh wow, this may come down to me,’” Shi recounted. “Honestly I think in that moment I had a bit of nervous energy, but I tried to keep it one point at a time and just take my time, not get too excited and ahead of myself.”
Shi clinched the final match of the competition, which was also the team’s Senior Day. Shi easily kept his cool to win the final point necessary for the Ivy League title with a perfect 6-4, 6-0 win against Michael Sun. The victory closed out the regular season and highlighted the senior captain’s talents on the court.
“It was only fitting on senior day that Brian should be the one that clinches and gets us over the finish line,” Coach Rueb reflected after the match. “We will so miss Brian and his leadership and his warmth, and just watching him play.”
This sentiment is certainly echoed by the rest of the team, as evidenced by their support for Shi as he finished up the match. It was an emotional moment for the team, especially for Shi.
“It felt great to see all the guys right next to me, especially on that last point. They were standing there, hands over each others’ shoulders; to me it was a really special moment,” the senior captain said. “As soon as we won that point, all of the emotions came out from the entire season.”
While the regular season has ended, there is still work to be done: Harvard will now move on to the NCAA tournament. Because of their positioning in the top 16, they will host the first two rounds of the competition at home.
“Now we have a full week, 10 days or more, before our first NCAA match, so there’s some time there for us to rebound and make a push for this last half of the season here,” Coach Rueb said.
The NCAA Championships will take place from May 19-28. Regional championships, which the Crimson will host in Cambridge, start on Friday, May 6.

Sections
We’re in the home stretch. In just about a week, office hours and reading period will end, meaning you won’t get to see your section crush for an entire three months. And that’s if you're lucky. What if they’re graduating? What if they’ve been quadded? What if they decide to change their concentration and you’re no longer in similar classes? What if their start-up takes off and they drop out of Harvard????
My point is, life is short. Now is the time to shoot your shot, or forever hold your peace. Lucky for you, Flyby’s got you covered. We present: Shooting Your Shot Before the Semester Ends 101.
Invite them to study for the final together.
A classic move. I recommend going to Cabot Library or Smith; don’t jump the gun and book a room in the basement of Lamont or suggest the Stacks. You may be asking, “but what if we have a final paper instead?” Not to worry. Brainstorm/workshop that paper with them. Give feedback on each other’s writing. And look good while you’re doing it. You can make it work.
Ask them to grab coffee!
I know you’re already thinking that this is wayyy too forward and there’s no way you’ll work up the courage to do this. But this can be done in a very friendly way, and in the worst case scenario you just become friends, which is a great alternative. If you’re in the same section or class, you have at least some common interests. Next time you see them, casually slip in that you’d love to grab coffee and continue discussing derivatives or metaphysics or Luther’s 95 Theses or whatever it is that you do. No one turns down caffeine. Also, people love directness. Don’t go with the wishy washy “Are you free for coffee soon?” Instead, try “Do you want to grab Peet’s with me this afternoon? I’m super open, whatever time works for you!”
Swipe up on their Instagram story pubbing their club.
Their obscure, four person club is hosting an event with ~free food~? Grab a friend and head over to support! This is a great way to show them you’re interested in their life beyond their fabulous looks. And who knows, maybe you’ll find a new extracurricular you really like!
Volunteer to take their “I promise it’ll only take two minutes” research survey emailed to their entire House.
I know I can’t be the only one with these surveys flooding my inbox. And more importantly, let them know you did them a solid by taking it.
Invite them to a formal with you.
Formal season is officially here, and what better way to shoot your shot than this? All you need to do is shoot over a quick, informal text (example: hey, it’s ___ from section. I have Eliot fête on Tuesday, was wondering if you wanted to come with?) or if you’re feeling bold and romantic, ask them in person. “Formal-posal” it with a free boba, if you must.
Simply ask for their number. 
I believe in you! Take a shot — of water of course ;) — if you need liquid confidence. And then just rip the band-aid off: It can be painful to muster up the courage, but when you’re sending each other inside-joke GIFs afterwards, you’ll be glad you did it. Like I said, you might never see this person again in your Harvard career. YOLO.
All that pining, and for what? Do you really want to regret not making a move on that one person you thought was cute all semester??? No, you don’t. You never know if you don’t try :)
