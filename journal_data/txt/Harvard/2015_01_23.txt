After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 23, 2015, at 3:24 p.m.
In the latest development in an ongoing legal dispute, a woman who previously accused Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz of inappropriately having sexual relations with her when she was a minor has signed a sworn affidavit reaffirming her earlier allegations.
The woman, identified in court documents as “Jane Doe No. 3,” claims in the affidavit that she “had sexual intercourse with Dershowitz at least six times.” The woman and her lawyers had first leveled accusations against against Dershowitz in a Dec. 30 federal civil court filing, alleging that she had sexual relations with Dershowitz in multiple locations at the urgings of Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire and Harvard donor who served prison time for soliciting prostitution.
The Dec. 30 and subsequent filings are part of an ongoing civil suit against the federal government that challenges Epstein’s plea deal, which Dershowitz negotiated.
When they surfaced, Dershowitz flatly denied the claims, calling them “totally false and totally made up in every respect.” He has since filed a motion to intervene in the case, he said to protect his reputation.
In the affidavit reaffirming her claims, “Jane Doe No. 3” details her alleged sexual relationship with Dershowitz and writes that he has lied when denying her claims. She reasserted her claims that she had sex with Dershowitz in Epstein’s New York and Palm Beach homes, at Little Saint James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, at his New Mexico ranch, and on his plane.
“I have recently seen a former Harvard law professor identified as Alan Dershowitz on television calling me a ‘liar,’’’ she writes. “He is lying by denying that he had sex with me. That man is the same man that I had sex with at least six times.”
The first part of the 220-page Jan. 21 filing, written by “Jane Doe No. 3’s” lawyers, also casts doubt on the reliability of the plane manifests that Dershowitz had previously cited as evidence that the allegations against him could not be possible. Pointing to inconsistencies between the manifests and distinct flight logs kept by the private pilots of Epstein’s plane, the lawyers, Paul G. Cassell and Bradley J. Edwards, write that the logs “were likely designed to hide evidence of criminal activity—or perhaps later cleansed of such evidence.”
Those flight logs, included in the court documents, indicate that Dershowitz had traveled on Epstein’s plane, though not at the same time as “Jane Doe No.3.” Flight logs show that he flew from Palm Beach to New Jersey in 1998 with a passenger listed as “1 female,” although she is not named.
In an interview Thursday, Dershowitz again denied the allegations, saying that the claims in the affidavit are “totally and completely false” and that he will be able to prove his innocence. He denied altering the plane manifests later in an email, writing, “I hope they are [complete], because complete records would prove I was never on the plane with any young women.”
This most recent Jan 21. court filing is part of the alleged victim’s lawyers’ response to Dershowitz’s motion to intervene in the ongoing civil case challenging Epstein’s plea deal. It challenges the legitimacy of Dershowitz’s motion, arguing that he has ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the allegations against him because the lawyers have already sued him for defamation. In his public denials of the “Jane Doe No. 3’s” allegations, Dershowitz claimed that the lawyers knew the allegations were false.
Dershowitz’s criticism in interviews with a number of media outlets focused in particular on the fact that “Jane Doe No. 3’s” had not signed a sworn affidavit with her allegations. In an interview with The Crimson, Dershowitz alleged that “they didn’t submit a sworn affidavit because they know if they submit a sworn affidavit they would go to jail.”
“Jane Doe No. 3” filed her affidavit the same day as the release of a letter of support, signed by 38 Law School professors and developed over the course of a week, denouncing the procedures of the “recent attacks” against Professor Dershowitz.
Cassell and Edwards declined to comment beyond their filing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend was full of ups and downs for the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team. Rebounding from its four-goal loss to Yale at Madison Square Garden the week before, the Crimson (11-3-2, 7-2-2 ECAC) lit the lamp six times against Clarkson Friday. But one day later, it was St. Lawrence finding the back of the net with ease, as Harvard dropped its first game all season to a team not named the Bulldogs.
Trailing No. 20/- Quinnipiac by four points for the ECAC lead, the Crimson will need to rediscover its scoring touch this weekend if it wants to keep pace with the Bobcats. But standing in Harvard’s way is a longtime rival and yet another nationally ranked opponent.
FLYING FISH
A barrage of seafood will await Harvard on Friday when it heads west to take on Cornell (7-8-2, 5-5-0). For the last 40 years, the Crimson has been greeted to the tune of frozen fish every time it takes the ice at Lynah Rink, and despite recent attempts by rink officials to ban the ocean-life, Friday should prove no different. The two sides have been doing battle for over a century, with the Big Red leading the all-time series, 73-61-9.
Cornell heads into the newest installment of the rivalry coming off a weekend performance very similar to that of its opponent. The Big Red came up with a dominant 5-1 win over Union on Friday, but struggled to find any offense on Saturday in a 3-0 loss to Rensselaer.
Saturday’s lack of offense was nothing new, however, considering Cornell has recorded just 30 goals through 17 games. But the Big Red has found a way to win despite its deficiencies thanks to the play of sophomore goaltender Mitch Gillam. The netminder leads the country in both save percentage (.948) and goals allowed average (1.47).
In the opposing crease, junior goaltender Steve Michalek will be looking for his first career win over Cornell. After an impressive start to the season, the junior has come back down to earth over his last three games, allowing 10 goals in less than seven periods of play. For the Crimson to emerge from Ithaca with a victory, Michalek will have to go save-for-save with his toughest adversary yet.
Facing Gillam, junior forward Jimmy Vesey will look to extend his streak of consecutive games with a point to 17. After seeming to have that run come to an end on Saturday, Vesey was the beneficiary of a scoring change this week, earning credit for Harvard’s lone goal against St. Lawrence. The junior ranks second in the country in points per game, driving the Crimson with 14 points and 11 assists.
RAIDER RACE
The road trip does not get any easier Saturday, when Harvard takes on No. 15/13 Colgate (14-7-1, 6-3-1). Like Cornell, the Raiders have had little trouble keeping their opponents off the scoreboard, allowing the eighth fewest goals per game in the country. But unlike the Big Red, Colgate also has a knack for finding the back of the net itself.
The Warriors average 2.91 goals per game, good for third in the ECAC. Junior forwards Tyson Spink and Kyle Baun lead the team with 18 points each. Both forwards logged two points their last time out in a 5-4 win over Union on Saturday.
But up against a Crimson team that leads the conference in goals per game (3.69), the Raiders will have their hands full. Colgate will be without their blue line anchor, senior defenseman Spiro Goulakos, who suffered a lower body injury against Union. Goulakos leads the team with 11 assists.
But the Raiders are not the only team to have been bit by the injury bug. Several questions surround the Harvard camp regarding the status of three of its core players: junior defenseman Patrick McNally and the sophomore duo of Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone. The team was without all three last weekend and has seen both Kerfoot and Malone out for extended periods of time this season.
Although Colgate has three more overall wins than the Crimson, the Raiders trail the Crimson by three points in conference play. Currently tied for fifth place, Colgate also sits three points ahead of eighth-place Cornell.
