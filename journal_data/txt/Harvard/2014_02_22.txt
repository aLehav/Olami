After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin M. Rudd will be joining the Kennedy School of Government this spring as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, the school announced Friday afternoon. Rudd will also serve as an Institute of Politics visiting fellow during his time at the Kennedy School, which will begin next week.
Rudd’s work at the Belfer Center will focus on investigating a new strategic relationship between China and the U.S. and its potential global impacts.
“His expertise on China will be invaluable to our collaboration with the Ash Center in exploring China’s rise and possible responses by the U.S. and international community,” Belfer Center Director Graham T. Allison ’62 said in the press release.
In addition to his experience as prime minister from 2007-2010 and again in 2013, Rudd brings 30 years of China-related experience to the Belfer Center and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, another program housed at the Kennedy School, which is studying U.S.-China relations. In addition to speaking Mandarin, Rudd majored in Chinese language and Chinese history at the Australian National University before embarking on a career that has included both living and working in China.
Rudd stressed the importance of his work at the Belfer Center in today’s global economy. “I believe the China project is important if we are to advance both the concept and the substance of what the Chinese call ‘a new type of great power relationship’ between Washington and Beijing,” Rudd said in the release.
While speaking at the IOP last April, Rudd said that the possibility of conflict arising from China’s potential replacement of the U.S. as the world’s largest economy is “the central question of the first half of the 21st century.”
In addition to leading a major research effort, Rudd will join Michael D. Huckabee, Liz Montoya, and Avshalom Vilan as an IOP Visiting fellow for the rest of the spring term. He will conduct four study groups at the IOP on Mondays in March and April, beginning March 3.
 
According to IOP Fellows and Study Groups Programs Manager Eric R. Andersen, Rudd’s speech was a “big hit” among students last Spring.
“Our students at the IOP tell us all the time how much they’re interested in international leaders, and learning about perspectives that are not just US-centric,” Andersen said. “[Kevin] Rudd is a leader in that area--in a lot of different areas, including global climate change, economic changes globally, and of course on China. These are all areas that our students ask us to address, and we’re pleased that Mr. Rudd is going to give us some of his time to talk about that this spring.”
 
IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 believes that Rudd’s popularity as a speaker last year will contribute to him being a large asset to the Harvard community in the months to come.
“As an Institute visiting fellow this spring, here for a much longer period, we are sure even more undergraduates will take advantage of the opportunity to learn from and engage with him and that his presence will create strong interest among faculty and the entire University community,” Grayson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The US women’s hockey team has certainly grown accustomed to heartbreak throughout the years, and Thursday afternoon proved no different.
After carrying a 2-0 lead over Team Canada into the final 3:30 of the gold medal match in Sochi, the Americans broke down, squandering their advantage and falling to the Canadians in overtime, 3-2.
Hockey is a game of inches, and that is exactly the margin by which Team USA missed acquiring its first gold medal since 1998. Trailing 2-1 in the final minutes of the contest, the Canadians pulled their goaltender, but they lost possession of the puck.
From her own zone, USA forward Kelli Stack sent a shot the length of the ice, nearly securing a different fate for the Americans. But the puck found iron, enabling Team Canada to claw its way back and earn its fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal.
While a silver medal is certainly nothing to scoff at, the Americans have proved time after time why in truth the precious metal does not feel like such a precious medal.
In 2002, Team USA dominated group play, outscoring its opponents, 28-1. Next, it blanked Sweden in the semifinals, 4-0. However, the team’s remarkable run was marred by a defeat at the hands of Team Canada in the gold medal match.
Eight years later, the American squad practically followed the same script. Team USA cruised through both group play and its semifinal matchup, outscoring its opponents over the four games, 40-2. The offensive outburst carried the Americans into another final against the Canadians, but in that contest, Team USA failed to tally a single goal.
In 2006, Team USA fell in the semifinals. The team moved on to the bronze medal match where it was victorious, allowing the team to return from Italy with a winning taste in its mouth. The fact of the matter is that silver is a tough medal to swallow in hockey.
Nonetheless, despite the loss, this year’s entertaining gold medal match created a buzz around the country, especially on social media. Here at The Back Page, we have compiled all different sorts of reactions to the Canadian victory on Twitter, and now we would like to share them with you. Enjoy!
10. Alex Morgan, star of the US women’s soccer team that finished second in the 2011 World Cup, can definitely relate to this American squad, and she is proud of its performance.
“Heart wrenching loss for USA Hockey. Played their hearts out and should be proud of the silver medal they're coming home with.  ‪#TeamUSA”
9. After seeing the excitement that this year’s final provided, Todd Fuhrman from FoxSportsLive offers a great suggestion.
“For the '18 winter Olympics can we just get a ‪#TeamUSA vs ‪#TeamCanada Womens hockey best of 7 to decide gold? Let others play for bronze…”
8. Harvard’s very own Laurent Rivard, a senior men’s basketball player, now has to deal with a broken caps lock key after celebrating his homeland’s victory.
“CANADA!!! Congrats!! We fought till the end!!”
7. Despite no longer playing for Team USA, former hockey star Erika Lawler still feels the raw emotion over her former squad’s defeat.
“What can I say? I love you guys and my heart is broken. Know that you have made us all proud. ‪@usahockey ‪#USWNT Especially me.”
6. BuzzFeed’s Senior Editor Samir Mezrahi is using Team Canada’s win to poke a little fun at Facebook’s recent endeavors.
“Facebook buys the Canada women's hockey team for $16 billion in cash and stock”
5. Cloyd Rivers, the owner of a popular Twitter account, is not having that tough of a time getting over the USA’s difficult loss.
“Sure Canadaland, you won the gold in women's hockey, but how many World Wars have you won? Back to Back World War Champs, son. Merica.”
4. On the other hand, author Ken Jennings has a different opinion.
“Honestly, we should let Canada have hockey. It seems to mean so much to them.”
3. The dramatics of the gold medal match clearly affected millions, including ESPN and Sports Illustrated writer Andrew Brandt.
“USA hockey should be served with a defibrillator...”
2. Sports Illustrated writer Andy Glockner seems to agree with us: What would an Olympic hockey game be without a Miracle reference?
“Do you believe in maple? Yes.”
1. Last but not least, Soaring to Glory, the FanSided page for the Boston College Eagles, gives our favorite take on Canada’s overtime hero, Marie-Philip Poulin.
“Of course some BU girl ruins everything for America.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team now has two losses in conference play, and they have one thing in common: the opponent.
Down by nine with two minutes to go, sophomore guard Kit Metoyer grabbed the inbounds pass from junior forward Erin McDonnell and told her teammate confidently, “Let’s do this—we got it.”
But one missed Crimson jump shot later, Penn guard Alyssa Baron caught the ball on the right wing with 1:35 remaining and knocked down a trey—her third of the night—to extend the deficit to 12.
It was that kind of night for Harvard (17-6, 7-2 Ivy), which couldn’t find the bottom of the net against the toughest defense in the conference, and Penn (17-5, 7-1) handed the Crimson another loss, 63-50.
“[The shots we were taking] felt good,” senior guard Melissa Mullins said. “That’s why this loss kind of hurts, because it felt good and we lost, so it’s like, ‘Hmm, what do we do?’”
The Quakers’ victory put them atop the league, a half game ahead of Harvard, and broke the Crimson’s 21-game winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion, where it had not dropped a contest since a Feb. 24, 2012 game against Princeton. Harvard now needs a Penn loss to the Tigers to regain control of its fight for the Ancient Eight title.
“It’s not the end of the world by any means,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “I think there’s some adjustments we can make—obviously to keep them off the boards, limit our turnovers…. This isn’t the end of the Ivy season by any means. Anything can happen, and we’re still in a good position.”
Even though Penn shot just 33.8 percent, it proved enough for a double-digit win, as the home team hit 30.8 percent of its shots and just 10.5 percent from downtown. The Crimson averaged 35.2 percent from behind the arc entering Friday night’s game.
Midway through the second half, a long jumper from junior forward Temi Fagbenle cut Penn’s lead to seven. On Harvard’s next possession, McDonnell had the opportunity to cut the deficit to four with a wide-open three, but in a common theme on the night for the Crimson, it rimmed in and out.
“We missed a lot of put-backs and bunnies, and some threes that normally fall for us,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “2-for-19 from three? That’s just not us. We’re a very good three-point shooting team, just not tonight. Penn didn’t [shoot well]. But they hit 6-for-20 threes, and we hit 2-for 19, and that’s a big difference.”
After closing the first half with a 6-1 run to pull within four, the Crimson appeared to have its best shot at regaining control of the game at the opening of the second half. Harvard’s defense did not allow a bucket in the final 4:55 before halftime, reverting to a zone and showing Penn full-court presses that effectively silenced the opposing team until the break.
But less than a minute into the second half, Quakers guard Meghan McCullough knocked the ball out of McDonnell’s hands, grabbed an offensive rebound off of a missed teammate’s trey, and knocked her own down from the top of the key.
The Crimson started the half shooting 16.7 percent from the floor, and would never get within five for the rest of the night.
“They’re a physical, blue-collar, tough-working team, and some of those [turnovers] were just like batting the ball out of our hands,” Delaney-Smith said. “That shouldn’t happen. They took care of the ball way better than we did.”
Harvard coughed the ball up 21 times, nearly twice as often as Penn did. The Quakers utilized their height in center Sydney Stipanovich and forward Courtney Wilson—both listed at 6’3”—to dominate down low, pulling down offensive boards and converting on the easy put-backs that the Crimson could not match.
The night opened with both teams trading shots in a tight contest. Harvard took a brief four-point lead eight minutes into the matchup off of five consecutive Clark points, but the Quakers quickly responded. A five-minute scoring drought allowed Penn to open up a nine-point advantage, its largest of the half.
Clark led the team in scoring with 12 points, while Fagbenle recorded her 13th double-double, with 10 points and 12 boards. Baron led the Quakers’ offensive attack with 18 points, 16 of which came before halftime.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—In a game that wasn’t close, there was one statistic that was a dead heat:  both Penn and Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Brandyn Curry tallied four steals on the night.
This was the second time in as many games that the senior either matched or topped the opposing team’s steal total. Last Saturday, against Cornell, Curry’s five edged Cornell’s four in a blowout victory.
Six days and four steals later, Curry’s squad again came out on top. The Crimson (21-4, 8-1 Ivy) took care of Penn (6-16, 3-5), 83-63, at the Palestra on Friday night.
With 14:21 left to play, Harvard inbounded the ball to sophomore guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers sent the rock to junior wing Wesley Saunders, who found Curry just behind the left elbow. Curry’s ensuing jumper gave the Crimson a 19-point lead, 57-38.
On the subsequent Quaker possession, Curry intercepted an errant Penn pass, and led a Harvard fast break in the other direction. The co-captain missed the resulting layup but, only 21 seconds later, Curry’s on-ball defense forced Matt Poplawski to cough up the ball.
Curry proceeded to go coast-to-coast, rolling in the layup.
“Our ability to grab loose balls, find things early, [and our] unselfish[ness were] the keys for the game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Crimson notched 13 steals on the night, its second highest mark of the season. On the other end, the team turned the ball over only eight times—its second lowest mark of the season. The Quakers, meanwhile, totaled 20 turnovers—the seventh time this year that Penn made 20 or more mistakes in a single game.
“The word efficient is a word that we honed in on coming into this game,” Amaker said. “I was very pleased with our ability to take care of the ball and not be sloppy…. [We played] efficient basketball.”
BALANCING ACT
For the fourth straight contest, four Harvard players scored in double digits. Co-captain Laurent Rivard, senior forward Kyle Casey, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, and Saunders all scored 12 points or more, while Curry—off the bench—and Chambers poured in nine apiece.
“I definitely think that the season…can be tiring and a grind, and for us to have the ability to go to our bench and trust our bench, that was another example of our bench and our balance,” Amaker said. “Those are the two “B” words that have been critical all year, and that was on full display again [tonight].”
The balanced scoring was largely a result of the distributive efforts of Chambers. The sophomore tallied 10 assists, his highest total of the season and one short of his career-high.
While Chambers accumulated 10 dimes, Penn totaled 12 as a team.
Perhaps Chambers’ most notable assist of the night came with 17:42 remaining in the second period. Following a turnover by Quaker Jamal Lewis, Chambers held the ball near the top of the key, motioning for Moundou-Missi to give him a screen. The big man delivered, and Chambers brushed by the pick, threading a pass through multiple defenders to Casey, who was waiting on the low block. Moments later, Casey finished the play with an emphatic dunk, giving the Crimson a 50-32 lead.
“I thought Siyani was the catalyst for our team,” Amaker said.
HISTORY LESSON
When Harvard matches up with Princeton on Saturday night, it will be with hopes of earning its first victory in Jadwin Gymnasium in over 25 years—since Feb. 3, 1989.
And, if the Crimson pulls off the victory and heads back to Cambridge with two more wins under its belt, it will be the first time that the squad has swept the Killer P road trip since 1985. On Jan. 11, 1985, Harvard took down Princeton, 60-50. On the following night, the Crimson handled its Pennsylvania opponents, 77-75.
In other words, the last time that Harvard went 2-0 on this weekend trip, Ronald Reagan had yet to be sworn in at his second presidential inauguration. Michael Jordan was in his NBA rookie season. LeBron James was one year old.
“This is a huge weekend,” Curry said. “I know the history [of Harvard playing at Jadwin]…. So more than anything, we want that [win] really bad. So I’m glad we were able to get this one [against Penn], because it’s easy to look ahead to that game and slip up. We knew Penn was going to be a tough game tonight, play us hard…. Now we can focus on getting [tomorrow’s victory] because we want that one really bad.”
Last season, the Cambridge squad came close to earning that elusive victory at Jadwin. Down 10 with 10 minutes to play, Harvard mounted a comeback, and had a one-point advantage with 2:30 remaining. However, six made free throws by the Tigers in the final 1:06 enabled the home team to keep its Jad-winning streak alive.

If you haven't been busy binge-watching House of Cards or cramming for your next midterm, you might have noticed that someone has donated a cool $150 million to Harvard.  But before you start celebrating like you just won the lottery, keep in mind that just because the school got the money it doesn’t mean you will be getting your own butler any time soon. Here are a few other things we won’t see on campus, even with this generous donation.Cheap Books and CoursepacksYou probably will still have to sell your soul to The Coop in order to get all the required coursebooks. Either that or keep using multiple email accounts on Amazon so you don’t have to pay for Prime.Hot Breakfast in the HousesIf you are one of the few to wake up more than 3 minues before your class starts, you're still stuck with toast. On the bright side, you can still trek to Annenberg to hit up that daily omelet bar.Free Netflix Accounts for the Entire Student BodyYou still have to pay the $8 fee on your own. Besides we have Philo, which is the same thing…. sort of. And I guess the University shouldn’t sponsor endless hours of catching up on Orange is the New Black...A Recognizable Performer for YardfestWith April fast approaching, it’s time to think of who could possibly be our headline performer. The reaction to past performers has been mixed to say the least.  Still keep your expectations low.Free 24/7 Door-to-Door Shuttle ServiceIt always rough walking from one side of the Yard to the other, let alone all the way to Quad. It would be great to have shuttles that drop you right at your door, especially at 4 in the morning after a long night “studying in Lamont.” A fleet of limos could also do the job just as well.Even though these changes would be a great addition to our community, we just have to face the facts and accept that these will never happen. Clearly the University hasn’t been in the spending mood recently, but I guess $150 million for financial aid is cool too.
