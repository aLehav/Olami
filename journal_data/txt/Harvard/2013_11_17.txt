After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returners and newcomers took center stage at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink on Saturday night as the Harvard men’s hockey team snapped a four game losing streak.
In the highly-anticipated return of junior defenders Patrick McNally and Max Everson, Crimson freshmen Sean Malone and Tyler Moy scored their first NCAA goals to help the visitors hold off Princeton, 5-3. Malone bookended the score sheet with his first two collegiate strikes, and Moy contributed a goal and two assists for his first three Harvard points.
Sophomore forwards Kyle Criscuolo and Jimmy Vesey also scored in the final frame to add to their team-leading offensive totals. The Crimson (3-4-1, 2-4-1 ECAC) bounced back from Friday’s 3-2 loss at No. 6 Quinnipiac to secure its first road win of the season.
“I thought that both games [this weekend] we really battled hard,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Last night we didn’t get rewarded. We could have easily walked away with a tie or win last night, so to get the win tonight is big and something we hope to build upon.”
While Saturday belonged to the freshmen, it was also a big night for three Harvard juniors. Exactly a year after withdrawing from school, the Crimson’s top defensive pair was back on the ice. In addition, junior goaltender Steve Michalek, who also withdrew last season, recorded his first win for Harvard in more than a year to improve to 1-2-1 on the season.
“Having Pat McNally and Max Everson in the lineup really helped us a lot here,” Moy said. “They’re two great players and they really add a lot to the team.”
McNally provided the Crimson blueline a new threat on offense, taking the puck coast-to-coast on occasion and putting three shots on Tiger goaltender Sean Bonar. Michalek was perfect through two periods and made 33 saves.
Goals from Moy, Criscuolo, and Vesey within two and a half minutes of each other gave the Crimson a 4-1 cushion midway through the third period. It would turn out to be just enough.
Center Aaron Kesselman brought the Tigers (2-7-0, 1-5-0) back within two off a quick strike in transition less than two minutes after Vesey’s goal, and Princeton crept within one with less than a minute left off a six-on-four power play goal by forward Tom Kroshus.
The Crimson would hold on for its second win of the ECAC season. An empty-netter from Malone with four seconds left sealed the deal for Harvard in its Ivy opener.
“I think we made it maybe a little more difficult than we needed to once we got that 4-1 lead,” Donato said. “But I think there were a lot of guys who played well and a lot of lessons that were learned with the win.”
Harvard controlled the pace early, and Malone put away his first goal of the night off a rebound from Vesey 13 minutes into the game. In the second, Michalek came up with the night’s biggest save on a penalty kill, stopping a point-blank shot from Tiger forward Michael Ambrosia in the slot before sliding to his left to make a sprawling glove save on a rebound opportunity by Kesselman.
“[Michalek] played unbelievabl[y],” Moy said. “He had a few glove saves during the game that were just jaw-dropping. It was great to see him stand on his head.”
A shorthanded Princeton goal tied things up early in the third. After the Crimson power play failed to convert on a 44-second two-man advantage, Tiger forward Tucker Brockett exited the box to set up teammate Aaron Ave on a successful two-on-zero breakaway.
But Harvard made sure that the home team’s momentum stopped there. Four minutes later, Moy capitalized on an errant pass from Princeton defender Jonathan Liau in the Tiger zone to put the Crimson back on top for good.
Criscuolo and Vesey each scored their fifth goals of the year in the next two and a half minutes to build a commanding 4-1 advantage.  Criscuolo received a feed from classmate Brian Hart to put one around Bonar in front of the crease. Vesey tapped in a power play goal after a wide slap shot from Moy bounced off the back boards and onto the sophomore’s stick.
“In the third period, I like how we bounced back,” Donato said. “We had several chances on the five-on-three to make it 2-0 and then they scored the shorthanded goal. It ended up being a pretty good test of our ability to handle adversity and our guys really responded.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an upset loss in its first dual meet of the season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (2-1, 2-1 Ivy) was determined to right the ship when it traveled to Hanover, N.H. this past weekend.
The Crimson did just that on Saturday, as they swept the Tri-Meet and broke numerous pool and personal records. Harvard seemed to have forgotten about its loss at Columbia two weeks ago, as the team had its best performance of the season.
“After Columbia, we had a long bus ride home,” sophomore swimmer Kendall Crawford said. “We talked about what went well at the meet and what we could improve on for the next meet.”
After going undefeated in dual meets for over two full years, the Crimson was determined to remain in hot pursuit of a third consecutive Ivy League title. Facing league rivals Dartmouth and Cornell, Harvard returned to its usual form, winning 201-99 and 196-104, respectively.
“Coming into the Cornell-Dartmouth meet, we really [wanted] to show that losing to Columbia didn’t hurt our spirits at all,” Crawford said. “We are just as a fierce of a team as we were last year and we did that and showed that completely.”
With a total of 11 wins on the day, the Crimson regained control of the Ivy League and the loss against the Lions seemed like a distant memory. Harvard came out hot, taking first place in the first seven events of the meet.
“We know where we are in the season and we are focusing our goals towards the end of the season,” senior Sara Li said. “We didn’t want to let that loss take us off our path of winning the Ivy League Championship, so going into Dartmouth and Cornell we were focusing on ourselves and having fun.”
It was a record setting day for the Crimson, as the young stars took over in the pool. In the 200 medley relay, Crawford, along with fellow sophomores Danielle Lee, junior Stephanie Ferrell and freshman Victoria Chan, left the competition in their wake, recording a 1:45.00 time to win the race and beat the pool record by two seconds.
“We have been really working on relay starts this week and being more aggressive and having more fire and going for it,” Crawford said. “We really wanted to show that we were ready to go, and starting it off with such a strong relay really set the mark. Everything else just followed.”
Crawford didn’t stop there though, as she dazzled in the 100-yard backstroke to take a first place finish with a time of 55.34.
Lee continued on to set another pool record, posting a 1:50.63 in the 200 free to beat the old mark by over a second. This was also a personal record for Lee, swimming nearly a full second faster than her previous best at the Georgia Invitational last year.
Freshman Elina Leiviska took first place in the three-meter platform with a 306.35 point total and then nabbed first place again with a 284.65 in the one-meter dive. Sophomore Sherry Liu also performed well, recording a 10:09.73 to take first place in the long 1000 free.
“Every year it’s a new team and it’s really fun to adjust to that,” Crawford said. “There is always…new excitement and new blood. Training with some of the new freshmen has been really fun and it makes a big difference. “
But the rookies weren’t the only ones racing through the lanes, as Ferrell placed second in the 100 breaststroke, and then earned victories in the 200 breaststroke and 500 free to keep the Crimson’s momentum rolling. Junior Courtney Otto swam a whole three seconds faster than the competition in the 200 butterfly with a 2:04.20.
Harvard looked as if it wouldn’t lose in the pool, as it kept taking first place with another top finish from Chan in the 100 fly. As the Crimson’s strong day began to wind down, Chan led the 400 freestyle relay with fellow freshmen Daniela Johnson, Lee, and Li. The group would beat the previous record by over four seconds to put the icing on the cake for Harvard.
“Having the experience [of being a senior] has been really helpful,” Li said. “Everyone on the team really helps and inspires each other. We help the freshmen and their energy invigorates the upperclassmen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an undefeated 2012-13 dual meet campaign, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team extended its win streak into the 2013-14 season with a dominating performance in the pool on Friday night.
The Crimson (1-0) turned out a victorious performance in its first dual meet of the season over Cornell and Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., outscoring the Big Green (0-1), 211.5-88.5, and swimming past the Big Red (0-1), 229-71.
Harvard finished with top times in 13 of the meet’s 16 events, with seven different members of the squad earning first place recognition.
“Going out and putting up some fast times so early in the season is really exciting,” junior Zach Walters said. “I’m definitely optimistic for the future. It’s still early in the season, so we’re at a different spot than we’re going to be later, but going out and beating Cornell and Dartmouth was definitely great.”
Harvard’s team is relatively young, with 11 freshmen on the roster. Rookie Eric Ronda was a key contributor to the Crimson win, placing first in the 100 and 200 breaststroke, with respective times of 57.31 and 2:02.62. Fellow freshman Jack Manchester came out on top in the 200-yard backstroke, finishing in 1:47.27.
“We really rallied behind Jack’s 200 backstroke,” Walters said. “He had a phenomenal time this early in the season and it definitely got us excited to see what we are capable of doing. This is arguably the best freshman class that we’ve ever had, so it’s definitely really exciting to have them as extra support.”
Following suit, classmate Aly Abdel Khalik swam to a win in the 500, finishing with a time of 4:34.65. Not far behind him was freshman Cliff Goertemiller, who finished in second with a time of 4:35.19.
Goertemiller also picked up a first place finish in the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:24.22.
“I was pretty nervous because all the guys were watching and you don’t want to look like you cracked under pressure in front of the team,” Goertemiller said. “It was an incredible feeling to be able to contribute something towards an objective, which was the team’s performance…I definitely felt like I had the team on my back for that one. It’s easy to go fast when you have a great group behind you.”
Co-captains Chris Satterthwaite and Oliver Lee both won their races. Satterthwaite picked up a win in his 100 free with a time of 45.02, while Lee took home first in the 50 free, finishing in 20.63. Satterthwaite was also able to seal a victory in the 200 free, breaking a 32-year-old pool record with a time of 1:39.27.
Sophomores Jacob Luna and Leo Lim took home first and second place in the 200 butterfly, with finishes of 1:50.26 and 1:50.96, respectively.
“[The younger swimmers] are going to push us [veterans] to be better and we’re going to push them to grow and develop into becoming part of our team,” Walters said. “That should provide some pretty exciting results.”
In diving, junior co-captain Michael Mosca won both events, scoring 370.60 points in the three-meter and 326.15 in the one-meter dive. Mosca outscored both Cornell and Dartmouth by more than 43 points combined. Senior Joe Zarrella finished behind Morsca in the two events, earning 333.40 and 320.15 points, respectively.
The Crimson was able to end its night on a high note, taking the 400 freestyle relay in 3:02.48. The winning team was comprised of Lee, senior Danny Crigler, junior Griffin Schumacher, and Satterthwaite.
“Coming back together for the relays is always an exciting thing,” Walters said. “It’s a good way to start and cap off each meet and the whole team really rallies behind these group efforts, so it’s definitely one of the more engaging performances of the meet.”
For Harvard, this was the first meet under new head coach Kevin Tyrrell. Previously one of the team’s assistant coaches, Tyrrell now heads the program after former head coach Tim Murphy left the squad to take the same position at Penn State.
“We’ve had a lot of transitions lately with a new coach and some of our teammates leaving abruptly,” Goertemiller said. “I think a lot of people were kind of rattled going into this meet, but I feel like the fact that we still turned up as a team really pulled everyone back together and refocused the apparatus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the No. 6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team stepped onto the Bright-Landry Hockey Center ice Saturday afternoon, it knew that the key to its game against Colgate would be to shake off the memories from the previous night’s game.
Less than 20 hours before, the Crimson allowed three goals to Cornell within a 14-minute span. As a result, what seemed to be a secure win against an ECAC and Ivy League rival ultimately ended in a 3-3 tie.
This time the opponent was Colgate, a team against which Harvard owned a dominant 22-1-2 all-time record, but the Crimson (6-1-1, 6-1-1 ECAC) struggled to find its own pace.
“It was a tough game for us, not our best,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “I think [Friday] night definitely showed through in our energy level [Saturday].… The whole 60 minutes were a grind.”
In the absence of sustained momentum, newcomers stepped up to keep Harvard in the driver’s seat in a 2-0 win. Freshman goaltender Brianna Laing silenced a heated Colgate (3-11-0, 1-7-0 ECAC) offense in her first collegiate game.
“I was really looking forward to [the game] and tried to bring a positive attitude to it,” Laing said. “I just took it shot-by-shot rather than thinking about having to win.”
Laing’s approach proved to be effective as the rookie notched 21 saves en route to securing the 2-0 shutout, the team’s fourth shutout this season.
“I give Brianna a lot of credit,” Crowell said.  “She made some huge saves in her first game ever to get a shutout. It was a tight game and we were on the [penalty] kill quite a bit, so she stood tall and showed that she’s not just a backup goalie. She’s a very capable goalie and it’s good for us to know that defensively she can keep pucks out of the back of the net.”
While Laing spearheaded the Crimson’s defensive efforts, another freshman, defenseman Natasha Rachlin, put Harvard on the board first with a goal midway through the first period.
Following a scramble in the left corner, sophomore center Mary Parker emerged with the puck and connected with Rachlin, who was breaking down the right side. Rachlin took the pass and shot it past the Raiders’ goaltender Susan Allen for her first collegiate goal.
“I was really excited to score my first goal,” Rachlin said. “I love this team, and I am very happy to do what I can for it.”
Despite the early goal, the Crimson could not maintain its offensive pressure for long as Colgate brought renewed energy and intensity to the ice. Harvard was also hampered by seven penalties on the game, a season-high.
“I say it every time: we learn something from every game, whatever situation we are put in,” Crowell said. “[This game] was a grind. It was tough for us to get going at all.… We have to figure out how to play two games hard, no matter how short the bench is or [whomever] we play. Every team in our league is good and we have to be ready.”
The extended lead that Harvard sought all game long eventually came with just over three minutes left to play.
Junior defender Sarah Edney began a rush from the Harvard end, passing the puck to sophomore forward Miye D’Oench. D’Oench advanced deep into the Raiders’ territory, drawing Colgate goaltender Susan Allen and the Raiders defense towards her, then sent the puck towards freshman forward Sydney Daniels. Daniels, on a charge down the ice towards the net, nudged it in to give the Crimson a crucial 2-0 lead.
“I think the last 20 minutes [were especially significant],” Crowell said. “The last night we gave up three goals in the third period, and we definitely did not want to do that again. [The players] rallied around each other and found a way to get that goal to get us in a more comfortable position those last few minutes.”
With the win, Harvard extended an undefeated streak that dates back to its loss to RPI on Nov. 1, and sits in second place in the ECAC, just behind Cornell (8-0-2, 6-0-2 ECAC).
“I think we now know that we can do better,” Crowell said. “Practice, practice makes perfect. That’s where we will begin on Monday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two periods in the contest between the Ivy League’s highest-powered women’s ice hockey squads, No. 6 Harvard had No. 3 Cornell on the ropes. The Crimson had gone up 2-0 in just the first period, and Cornell had been unable to make up any ground in the second despite getting off 12 shots to Harvard’s one.
But after 40 minutes of struggling against the Crimson defense, it only took two minutes for the momentum to shift in the Big Red’s favor in a game that eventually ended in a 3-3 tie, leaving Harvard (6-1-1, 6-1-1 ECAC) in second behind league leader Cornell (8-0-2, 6-0-2).
“I love the way we came out in the first period,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said. “I think we had a ton of confidence, a ton of momentum, got all over the goalie…. that’s what we have to do for 60 minutes. But we let them back into it, we let them believe that they could play with us, and that’s what happened.”
Seconds into the final period, Cornell captain Jessica Campbell raced up the left side of the ice and wristed a hard shot from near the point. Sophomore goalie Emerance Maschmeyer managed to get a piece of it, but the puck trickled past the goal line to put Cornell within one, ending the Harvard defense’s streak of 31 straight penalty kills.
It took just over a minute for the Big Red to strike again. Cornell junior Emily Fulton made a perfect pass from behind the net to a streaking Jillian Saulnier, who received the puck just in front of the goal and tapped it in with no hesitation to tie the game up at two, less than two minutes into the third.
“It was a roller coaster,” Crowell said. “Obviously we had a really good start in the first [period] and would have liked to continue to play that way. The second was a tough one for us…but I think we weathered the storm, didn’t give any [goals] up. But clearly in the third, it wasn’t the way we wanted to start.”
Despite watching its lead disappear in  78 seconds, the Crimson refused to let the Big Red take over. After receiving the puck just above the blue line, sophomore Mary Parker slapped a shot past goalie Lauren Slebodnick and into the upper-right corner of the net to regain the Harvard lead.
“We just battled through,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said. “Even when they scored two goals, we came right back and scored a goal…. Emerance played great, so hopefully next time we won’t let  [up] those two minutes where they score two goals.”
Cornell, however, once again proved that it had an answer for whatever the Crimson could throw at it. With less than five minutes remaining in the contest, Saulnier redirected an Emily Fulton slapshot under Maschmeyer’s leg to tie the game at three and send it to overtime.
The Big Red had a chance to grab the win in the final seconds of the overtime period, when Campbell managed to get past the Harvard defense to go one-on-one with Maschmeyer. But the sophomore made a point-blank save as the buzzer sounded to preserve the tie for the Crimson.
“It was a little frightening,” Maschmeyer said. “There were only two seconds left, so I think my heart dropped out of my chest for a second. But I had to keep calm and collected because I knew I had to make that save.”
Harvard came out firing in the first period, as D’Oench stole the puck at center ice less than two minutes into the game to create a one-on-one opportunity and fired a shot past the Cornell netminder to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead. Later, D’Oench provided the assist on freshman Sydney Daniels’ first career goal and put Harvard up by two to finish the first.
Despite losing the lead, the Harvard squad is looking to take something positive away from the experience.
“If you walked into the game today and you told me we were going to tie Cornell, I think I would have been content,” Crowell said. “Having had a two-goal lead is frustrating, and then to go up again and have the 3-2 score and then give it up again is frustrating. But to hold out after giving up so much momentum in the end...there is some silver lining in that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With one minute remaining in his final game of his career, senior midfielder Kevin Harrington took his last collegiate penalty kick. The ball shot past the hands of University of Pennsylvania sophomore goalkeeper Max Polkinhorne, sped towards goal, and ricocheted off the post. The shot was emblematic of Harvard’s play on the night: good but not good enough. The team (7-8-2, 5-2-0 Ivy) ended up falling 2-0 to the Quakers (7-8-1, 5-1-1), finishing second in the Ivy League.
Missed opportunities were the theme of Saturday night’s game for the Crimson. The team had 17 shots, 11 corner kicks and one penalty kick, but the players could not capitalize.
On the other side, Penn struck early. In the fourth minute of play, the leading scorer for the Quakers, junior Duke Lacroix attempted a cross from the left side, which was unsuccessfully cleared by the Harvard defense and found its way to Penn attacker Nicky Yin, who took advantage of the Crimson’s bumbling defense and struck a hard shot towards sophomore goalie Evan Mendez. Mendez was unable to get a hand on the ball as the Quakers took an early 1-0 lead.
“We struggled in the early part of the game,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We failed to step offensively which caused a couple of gaps, and they had some players who were dangerous who caused us some problems early.”
With 33 minutes left in the first half, Lacroix got a goal for himself. The Quaker stood alone at the top of the box, received a well-placed pass from his teammate, and dribbled past the Crimson defense to score his eighth goal of the season.
“Duke’s a special player,”  Penn coach Rudy Fuller said. “He’s certainly our key guy, and he has scored a lot of key goals. He presents a lot of problems to the opposition because of his athleticism and pace…He’s a really important piece of the puzzle to us.”
Lacroix accounted for four of the Quakers 15 shots on the night. Despite being down 2-0, Lehrer said that Harvard returned to the field after halftime looking reenergized.
“We came out second half wanting to leave everything on the field,” Lehrer said. “We were pushing up a little higher… We created some good opportunities.”
The Crimson earned eight corner kicks in the second half, but could not capitalize due to a strong showing by the Quaker’s defensive line, and four saves made by Polkinhorne.
When the buzzer signaled the end of the game, Penn was declared the Ivy League champion for the eighth time in program history.
Fuller said that both teams showed remarkable improvement this season from their last few seasons. Neither team had fought for the championship since 2009, when Harvard defeated Penn 1-0 to win the Ivy title.
“I credit both programs,” Fuller said. “As was well documented coming into this week, these were the two teams at the bottom last year. It was truly a remarkable turnaround for both of us.”
Harvard was winless in Ivy league play in both the 2011 and 2012 seasons, ending both seasons 0-6-1 in the conference. The Quakers went 1-6 on the 2012 season, only defeating the Crimson in conference play.
Harvard revamped its program this season under the leadership and drive of Lehrer. After his run at the University of California-Berkley, Mendez said that Lehrer was able to implement new strategies that helped the Crimson team progress.
“Pieter is fantastic,” Mendez said. “He has insight that we have never had before. He respects you and he gets a lot out of you.”
Prior to beginning play on Saturday, the Crimson team paid tribute to its senior class. The six seniors—A.J. Agha, Brett Conrad, Ross Freidman, William Giahos, Harrington, and Pascal Mensah—were not able to capture a championship in their four years at Harvard. However, Mendez said that they have played a big part of the team’s renaissance this year.
“The seniors are unbelievable,” Mendez said. “They have led the team and taken on a huge leadership role. They have played outstanding as well, and I cannot thank them enough for what they do.”
Despite losing these game-changing seniors, the Crimson players remain optimistic about their prospects in the 2014 season.
“Harvard soccer is back for sure,” Mendez said. “We are going to rebuild next year and will come right back and be in this game once again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team wasted no time with North Dakota State University.
After season opening contests that saw the Crimson struggle to play a full 40 minutes, Harvard (3-1) finally put the pieces together for both halves as coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s squad dismantled the Bison (1-2), 84-56, on Saturday at Lavietes Pavilion.  The Crimson is now ranked No. 25 in the CollegeInsider.com Women’s Mid-Major Top-25 poll.
“[Playing a full 40 minutes] is the MO we are trying to establish, which led me to great disappointment in the BU game,” Delaney-Smith said. “We knew that and so the conversation was something like, ‘You get a second chance now. Can you sustain two halves of basketball?’ Yes, we did that.”
Co-captain Christine Clark, who had a game-high 21 points, powered the first half with 15 points in the first 20 minutes. Clark was part of an offensive scheme, comprised of senior guards Elise Gordon and Melissa Mullins along with junior forward Temi Fagbenle, which dominated in the paint and out-rebounded NDSU by twice as many boards in the first half, 32 to 16.
Rebounding has been an Achilles’ heel for the Crimson, having been beaten on the boards in two of the three previous games this season. Mullins was essential in that respect, providing a game-high 10 rebounds, trailed closely by Gordon, who came off the bench to chip in eight rebounds and 10 points. Fagbenle was also a consistent low post presence, with seven boards and eight points, mostly from mid-range jumpers.
“I’m hoping that we can grow to continue to do those kind of tacks in the paint after ball movement,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought today was our best day so far moving the ball, opening it up a little and then getting in the paint.”
Defensive rebounding was key to shutting down the Bison offense, where top scorers Brooke LeMar and Marena Whittle were held to team-high scores of 13 and 11 points, respectively. NDSU shot at 33.8 percent overall, and was under 30 percent through the first frame.
“You can never take North Dakota State lightly in spite of them losing their first couple of games,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Harvard’s win] had nothing to do with them and everything to do with us. I feel my team is capable of certain goals defensively, and if they work hard at it, they can achieve them. It is more about us working together as a team to shut down these players.”
Harvard also excelled at holding onto possessions, turning the ball over just six times. The figure is a low for Harvard since any of the players on the roster joined the team. The Bison nabbed just two steals through the fixture.
“It was just making sure that we were patient and going through the offense, rotating the ball and making sure we see open cutters,” sophomore Shilpa Tummala said. “[We were] making the right passes with a lot of patience.”
Tummala contributed eight of a total 33 points from the bench. The 5’11” guard converted two of four three-point attempts and doled out three assists. Tummala provided power and accuracy at the perimeter that was, by and large, absent until the second half of the contest.
“I think my coaches and teammates always instill a lot of confidence in me,” Tummala said. “I try to do what they tell me to do. Kathy pulled me aside at half-time and said that she didn’t care if my shot went in or out, that I needed to focus on defense and rebounding first. I think similarly I tried to focus on defense and rebounding and my shot just fell.”
Tummala was instrumental in a second-half offense that saw the Crimson stretch a half-time lead of 19 points to 28 by the game’s end. Ten members of the team scored along the way.
“What we did really well was communicate, and that was lacking in the BU game,” Tummala said. “We did a good job talking on defense, which helped our offense.  It was our talk and our hustle that soared the momentum on offense.”
While Harvard has scored more than 75 points in each contest this season, the game was its highest scoring affair since notching 88 points in a win against Dartmouth during the 2012-13 Ivy League opener back in January. Saturday’s drubbing takes revenge for NDSU taking last year’s season opener, 81-72, in the first-ever meeting between the two teams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the league title was out of reach, the Harvard women’s volleyball team stepped on to the court at the Newman Arena on Saturday evening knowing that a win was necessary in order for it to secure second place in the Ivy League.
Coming into the final matchday of the season on Saturday, the Crimson (14-9, 9-5 Ivy) was tied with Penn for second in the Ivy League. Ultimately, the Quakers fell to Ivy-champions Yale, while Harvard was able to dominate Cornell (8-16, 4-10 Ivy) in a three-game sweep to take sole possession of second.
“I’m very proud about how we responded against Cornell, especially coming off our loss against Columbia”, sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace said. “We definitely focused our energies and played much more efficiently against Cornell.”
The Crimson featured a balanced attack on offense, with sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte leading at the net with 10 kills and five blocks. Due largely to the quick three set match, freshman setter Corinne Bain narrowly missed out on her seventh triple-double of the season, falling two kills and a dig short. Senior right side hitter Erin Cooney and co-captain Natalie Doyle both made significant contributions in their final games in the Crimson uniform, as Cooney chipped in four kills and Doyle added nine digs.
Despite being swept, the Big Red still put up a fight. Sophomore right side Breanna Wong led the team with nine kills and 15 assists, and freshman setter Alyssa Phelps chipped in a game-high 30 assists of her own.
In the end, the Crimson won because it was able to take advantage of situations and take control during tight situations. The teams were stuck 13-13 in the first set before Harvard eventually took control with strong play by Holte. In the second, the team took advantage of a 7-1 run to take the set after being tied at 12-12. In the third and final set, the Crimson broke the game open with a 7-0 run to take a decisive 17-9 lead.
“Next year we’ll continue to build and work towards that Ivy League championship, because I definitely think it’s achievable for us,” sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Schults said. “It’s definitely what we’re going to go towards.”
“It proves that the Harvard volleyball team is capable of contending for the Ivy League title next year,” Wallace added. “As much as I’m sad that the season’s over, I’m really looking forward to the future as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Columbia fans rushed to the court at Levien Gym on Friday night to celebrate its most recent upset, the Harvard women’s volleyball team could see its hold on second place in the Ivy slipping away.
“It definitely stung, but I think what we can take away from that is that we can never be complacent,” sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace said. “We need to go in with the mentality that it is our job to win the game.”
The Crimson (14-9, 9-5 Ivy) had been fending off a surging University of Penn team, which, as of Friday afternoon, had won six in a row to hold a tie for second place in the league. With just two games left in the season coming into the weekend, Harvard needed to win out in order to ensure a tie for second.
The Lions, however, had different plans. Despite its record, Columbia (6-16, 4-9 Ivy) dominated the game, taking advantage of the Crimson’s sloppy play to win the match in four sets.
In the first set, the home team started off quickly to take a 5-0 lead, and rounded out the set with a 13-6 run to decisively go up 1-0. Although it trailed its opponents by four points in the second set, it utilized another 5-0 run to take back the lead to win the frame.
Harvard fought back in the third, using a 5-0 run of its own to start its comeback. All was for naught, however, as its opponents jumped out to an 8-1 lead in the fourth and never looked back.
Wallace and freshman setter Corinne Bain continued their strong play, contributing 16 and 12 kills apiece. Bain also chipped in 24 assists, and rounded out her day with 13 digs, notching her sixth triple-double this season. Despite their excellent play, the team committed 28 errors on offense, with five players responsible for four or more of the errors.
Much like its offense, the service play for Harvard struggled, committing 11 errors throughout the match. Comparatively, the Lions only gave up two points during their serves, giving them an enormous advantage during the game.
“Columbia really slowed down the game and prevented us from getting into its system,” co-captain Natalie Doyle said. “The team was eventually able to bring it together,  but it was too late to win the set.”
The home team got strong offensive play from Katarina Jovicic and Bailey Springer, who each contributed 10 kills. Jennifer Petrovich pitched in a double-double, notching 22 assists and 13 digs.
“We can never expect something to go in our favor. We have to work for it to be in our favor,” Wallace said. “It’s definitely something that we took away from the match, and it’s something that we can apply to next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five minutes into the third quarter, sophomore running back Paul Stanton capped an effortless 76-yard drive by punching in his second touchdown of the day. The scoreboard read Harvard 38, Penn 0. It was a classic laugher.
But from that point on, nothing went right for the Harvard football team.
In a dynamic offensive surge bearing no resemblance to its feeble first half efforts, the Quakers scored touchdowns on four straight drives. And while the Penn defense appeared out to lunch in the first two quarters, it came alive in the second half and forced five consecutive Crimson three-and-outs.
The Harvard faithful must have been shocked when the Quakers offense took the field with just under four minutes remaining in a one-possession, 38-30 game. But after two fourth down conversions moved Penn inside the red zone, the Crimson defense finally held up and forced a turnover-on-downs. The improbable and valiant Quakers comeback fell just short.
“Finally we had a little bit of momentum and physicality back and finished some plays,” Penn coach Al Bagnoli said. “We were playing with a lot more juice and confidence, but it’s really hard to come back against that kind of football team when you’re that far behind. We dug ourselves a really deep hole.”
The momentum initially shifted with just over 10 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Following a Penn fumble and with a 38-point lead in his pocket, Harvard coach Tim Murphy decided to take out many of his offensive starters, including junior quarterback Conner Hempel.
The play calling turned conservative, as eight of the Crimson’s next nine offensive plays spanning over three drives were runs for little to no gain.
In the meantime, consistent strikes from Penn quarterback Ryan Becker made the score 38-22, and Harvard’s starters rushed back into the game. But Hempel could get nothing going, as the Crimson was forced to punt twice more.
Excluding Harvard’s touchdown drive on its first possession of the second half, the Crimson totalled just 29 yards of offense to Penn’s 262 in the final two quarters.
“There’s no reason to give up as many points as we gave up,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “That’s a team thing. Offense didn’t move the ball, defense didn’t stop them. We had some punts that were kind of iffy, and if you put that all together and it was very lackluster.”
NIGHT AND DAY
Little could better articulate Saturday’s football game than the overused phrase, “A Tale of Two Halves.” For Harvard, a dominant second quarter represented the peak of its performance.
The Crimson scored 31 points in those 15 minutes. With the pass game and running attack both working, Harvard seemed to glide up and down the field at will.
Hempel used both his arm and his feet to make plays, connecting with a number of different receivers across the field and amassing a team-high 61 yards rushing in the half, including a two-yard touchdown scamper.
Harvard added to an already sizable lead in the closing moments of the half. After successfully executing a two-minute drill punctuated by a Stanton touchdown run, it seemed that Penn would head to the locker room down 24.
But with just 40 seconds left in the half, captain Josh Boyd picked off Penn quarterback Billy Ragone over the middle. Harvard needed just two plays to march 40 yards for another touchdown, and the score became 31-0.
“We had great play calls, a great gameplan,” Hempel said. “We were switching it up, and the defense didn’t really know what was coming at them. I think our line brought everything they had today, and it showed a lot up front.”
Hempel was 17-of-18 at the end of the first half, Harvard had 290 yards of offense to Penn’s 56, and it had been seven quarters since the Crimson defense had surrendered a point.
Despite Penn storming back in the final two quarters, 15 productive minutes gave the Crimson just enough to hold on.
FOUR DOWN TERRITORY
At times in the second half, it seemed that the Harvard defense had stifled the Penn attack. But the Quakers repeatedly bailed themselves out of tough situations by converting on fourth down attempts.
In the third quarter, Penn converted a fourth-and-five and then a fourth-and-three the very next possession. Both of those drives resulted in touchdowns.
Harvard, on the other hand, was much more conservative. Up 16 points and faced with a fourth-and-inches in his own territory, Murphy elected to punt. While the Crimson did not go for a single fourth down all game, Penn converted on four out of five attempts.
“I’m thinking…we’re going to stop them,” Murphy said. “End of story. If you don’t believe, you go for it.”
Penn’s fourth down fortunes continued on its final drive of the game. Down just eight points and faced with a fourth-and-three, Becker’s pass deflected off his intended target directly into the hands of another receiver to move the chains. A few plays later with just over a minute remaining, a wideout hauled in another fourth down pass.
But the Crimson defense finally stopped the Quakers on fourth down with 27 seconds left when Boyd deflected a Becker pass. Once the ball hit the ground, Harvard fans could finally exhale safely.

Heart-wrenchingly difficult CS50 had office hours recently for the last p-set of the semester in Annenberg. Flyby decided to do some eavesdropping to document the mayhem that went on before p-sets were due the next day at noon. Here's the best of what we heard.
1. “Don’t go in there, I saw a rat!”Worrisome that this was said in Annenberg.
2. “Is it a bad idea to implement the teleport?”Another student: “Don’t do teleport! Don’t do it!”Trust the girl who tried to implement a teleport function for seven hours.
3. “That is a fire hazard.”Perceptively stated by a student as someone trips over a MacBook charger.
 
4. “Very close, very close, burning up!!”TF clueing in someone to the right code.
5. “This. Is. Beautiful.”As a student looks at their own code. You go, Glen Coco.
 
6. “Come on guys: DISPLAY YOUR SHUTTLE!”Screamed by a TF standing on table, to a crowd of students.
 
7. “I’m so outside the loop.”Get it? Loop? CS50 coding loop? Punny.
 
8. “So there’s no hash-tagging?”The only time when hashtags need to be executed thoughtfully.
 
9. “Last office hours? So sad…”The students hug. Emotions are running high.

It’s easy to complain about the late Thanksgiving we have this year. At this point, everyone is ready for The Game and, of course, break. Waiting an additional seven days before both can seem like a struggle. Oh, no, I have to spend a whole extra week battling the elements of the frigid Cambridge November and pretending to study for my midterms, while really I’m just dreaming of marshmallow covered sweet potatoes and my bed.
 
So, wondering how to survive until the end of November? It’s simple—start getting into the holiday spirit and get a jump start on the most wonderful time of the year! While our Christmas countdown is going the whole year, we understand that, for some, mid-November might seem a bit early for Santa hats and holly. Well, guess what—it’s not. Here are some ways to enjoy pre-Thanksgiving November and embrace the season.
 
1. Sounds of the Season
 
Start listening to your favorite holiday soundtracks and carols. It’s not acceptable to say, “I don’t like that kind of music,” because the variety is astounding. What artist doesn’t have a holiday album? There’s everything from Justin Bieber’s “Under the Mistletoe” to “A Motown Christmas” to Michael Bublé’s “Let it Snow” to the classic Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby tunes. We could go on and on.
 
2. Extreme Makeover: Seasonal Dorm Edition
 
Want to festivize your room? At the very least, everyone can (should) put up a strand of colored lights. If you are a fan of decorations, we encourage you to fit as much as you can into your dorm: a mini Christmas tree, stockings, a menorah, a wreath, candy canes, snowflake window stickers, fake snow to cover the floor, perhaps a singing Rudolph stuffed animal, etc. 
 
3. Eating Habits
 
Don’t be afraid to change your eating habits to embrace/accommodate the season. If that means going to Starbucks double the amount you normally do because you can’t get enough of the red cups, that’s totally fine. Eat peppermint bark for breakfast and gingerbread for dinner, and substitute eggnog for milk.
 
4. Festive Activities 
Take a break from Lamont to make use of the dorm kitchens and concoct some of your favorite sweets. Put on a holiday movie while you’re at it. Some favorites: “Miracle on 34th Street,” “Elf,” “The Holiday,” “The Polar Express,” and “How the Grinch Stole Christmas.”

On Thursday, University President Drew G. Faust announced that, in 2018 (probably, if all goes according to plan), the new Richard A. & Susan F. Smith Campus Center will open in the building formerly known as the Holyoke Center.
 
We’re intensely interested in what this forthcoming campus center will eventually house. A press release announcing the project’s timeline specified three things:
 
1. Food ServiceThis is ambiguous. What’s a food service? Is that a couple of vending machines, or is that a small café (like the one in the Science Center)? Either way, it’s not like we’re going to complain about new outlets for comfort eating, but the anticipation is killing us.
 
2. Study AreasYeah… because this really needs specification. If there was going to be any open space or any number of chairs and tables in the new campus center, it was already super obvious that Harvard students were going to turn it into a study space.
 
3. A LoungeIsn’t this sort of redundant? It’s an open space, and we assume there will be some number of chairs and tables. So it’s probably just going to turn into another study space.
 
But we at Flyby have a few suggestions of our own to make the new campus center more fun:
 
1. Game RoomA Nintendo 64, an Xbox, a TV, two pool tables, a ping-pong table, and some couches would cost the University an infinitesimally small percentage of their endowment. And it would be more fun than one of those “study areas,” even though it’s only a matter of time before some frazzled physics student starts doing mechanics experiments with the pool balls.
 
2. Study-free AreasLike, you actually get kicked out if you try to study or talk about classes. It’s forced relaxation, just like that episode of Spongebob where Mr. Krabs makes Spongebob take his vacation. It would be good for Harvard students (even if they don’t realize it).
 
3. TrampolinesEnough said. Bounce away all your troubles.
 
4. A place for the Dunkin’ Donuts on Bow StreetThis Dunkin’ Donuts is not going to close down, but it isn’t going to stay in the same location, either—it’s going to move further down Mass. Ave. Make it easier on everyone and keep supplying Harvard students with the caffeine they need to get through their lectures: just take a spot in the new campus center.
 
While we hope Faust will take our advice and make this campus center the new hub for non-academic activity on campus, we know the building will probably end up great and we look forward to what promises to be a NOT drawn-out and very noiseLESS construction process.
 
Side Note: If we ever donated enough money to Harvard to get a building named in our honor, we would definitely request something ridiculous. Imagine how hilarious it would be if tour guides had to tell prospective students that they were now passing “The Dragon Center for the Arts” or “The Magnum, P.I. Memorial Library.”
