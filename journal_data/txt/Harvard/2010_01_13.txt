After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will be audited by the Internal Revenue Service as part of the government's efforts to review practices at non-profit organizations that take advantage of tax exemptions.
The University is one of 40 colleges under examination by the IRS, which will conduct audits during the coming year after reviewing questionnaires probing related business activities and compensation at colleges around the country. IRS officials have said, according to media reports, that the questionnaires would trigger audits, but did not specify what exactly would cause the IRS to launch an audit.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has voiced loud criticism against tax-exempt organizations, including both universities and hospitals. In the past, Grassley has argued that universities receiving government funding should keep their operating costs low and dedicate more funds toward financial aid in lean economic times.
Grassley has been particularly critical of Harvard Medical  School and has clashed with the school in recent years over faculty and physician ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
According to the IRS website, the probe will include an inspection of executive compensation. Harvard has come under fire in recent years for compensation practices at Harvard Management Company, the organization that manages the University's $26 billion endowment.
In 2003, alumni protested what they viewed as excessive compensation in a series of letters to then-President Lawrence H. Summers. Faced with unwelcome media attention, the HMC board voted in 2004 to impose lower pay ceilings for fund managers, and HMC President Jack R. Meyer, who oversaw the endowment's growth from $4.7 billion to $26 billion, left the organization the next year to start his own hedge fund.
Additional concerns over HMC's practices surfaced after Meyer's departure when one former employee called Harvard's use of off-shore accounts into question.
In interviews with The Crimson last year, Steven M. Rose, a former HMC tax director, questioned whether a non-profit such as Harvard ought to be utilizing investment vehicles such as offshore companies to boost financial returns. Rose also said that during the time of his employment at Harvard in 2001, HMC operated with a profit-driven mentality that he considered at odds with the University's educational mission.
When asked about Rose's concerns last year, University spokesman John D. Longbrake wrote in an e-mailed statement that Rose’s complaints were “the subject of a thorough review by an external expert” that ultimately concluded they were “without merit.”
News of the impending audit comes on the heels of the University's decision to sell $480 million of debt to finance construction projects at the Law School and other operating costs.

CLARIFICATION: January 13, 2009
An earlier version of the Jan. 13 news article "IRS To Audit Harvard as Part of Non-Profit Probe" stated that Steven M. Rose, former tax director of Harvard Management Company, raised questions last year regarding HMC's investment practices and "profit-driven mentality." To clarify, Rose voiced such concerns to a Crimson reporter last year, but the concerns focused on HMC's practices at the time of his employment in 2001. University spokesman John D. Longbrake's statement has been added to further clarify the timing of Rose's concerns and the University's response.

Anne J. Hathaway—the star of movies ranging from The Princess Diaries to Rachel Getting Married—will be honored as Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 2010 Woman of the Year, officials at the Pudding said today.
"You can confirm it," said Clifford N. Murray '10, the theatrical organization's president, in an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday. Murray referred further comment to press manager David J. Smolinsky '11.
The Pudding selected Hathaway, 27, for her background in and commitment to theater, as well as her ability to play characters whose personalities and situations widely vary, according to Smolinsky.
"What impressed us the most has definitely been her range and the ability with which she can play such diverse characters," Smolinsky said, citing her roles in films ranging from comedies such as Get Smart to more serious films like The Devil Wears Prada and Brokeback Mountain.
Smolinsky also said that the Pudding was impressed by Hathaway's background in the arts.
"She grew up in musical theater," he said, noting that she performed in a public performance of William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night in New York City.
Hathaway will be honored in a parade from The Inn at Harvard on Mass. Ave. to the New College Theater at 12 Holyoke Street on Jan. 28 at 2:30 p.m. Following the parade, Murray and Vice President of the Cast Derek Mueller '10 will lead a roast of the Oscar nominee.
Hathaway started her career in the television series "Get Real" but only began gaining recognition when she took the role of princess-to-be Mia Thermopolis in the 2001 film The Princess Diaries. She subsequently played a supporting role in 2005's critically acclaimed Brokeback Mountain and in 2006's The Devil Wears Prada.
 In 2008, Hathaway played the role of Kym in Rachel Getting Married—a role that earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a drama.
Smolinsky declined to comment on the status of the decision on the Pudding's Man of the Year winner.

CORRECTION: January 14, 2009
An earlier version of the Jan. 13 news article "Anne Hathaway Selected for Pudding Woman of the Year" stated that Pudding producers Stephen L. Rola '11 and Kelly M. Conley '11 will lead the roast, and that the parade will end at the Au Bon Pain in the Square. This information, which was provided by Pudding press manager David J. Smolinsky '11, is incorrect. In fact, Smolinsky said later, Pudding President Clifford N. Murray '10 and Vice President of the Cast Derek Mueller '10 will be roasting Anne J. Hathaway, and the parade will end at the New College Theater at 12 Holyoke Street

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a month between competitions did not slow the Harvard track team. The Crimson men and women headed to Hanover, N.H. last weekend for the Dartmouth Relays, in which both squads took fourth.
Despite taking only a small group of competitors to the Leverone Field House—many did not return to campus until this week—Harvard coach Jason Saretsky praised his team’s effort.
“I’m really pleased,” he said. “It’s good to be able to knock off the rust after break. It’s a good feeling to know that exams are done and we have nothing to do but train and compete.”
The Crimson earned a pair of IC4A qualifications and showed depth across the board, as numerous athletes logged top-15 finishes in a crowded collegiate and open field. In particular, Harvard’s younger competitors demonstrated their potential.
Rookies Sydnie Leroy, Shannon Watt, and Meghan Ferreira all notched top-10 finishes in their respective events. Leroy took fifth in the pole vault—second among collegiate entrants—while Watt improved by over a meter since her last competition in the shot put, taking fifth with a throw of 13.33 meters.
Ferreira showed consistency in the 60-meter hurdles, putting up similar times through three races to claim eighth with a 9.53 in the finals.
“We had good performances from several of our freshmen,” Saretsky said. “Some of them were great, getting out there for the first time.”
But co-captain Jack Brady and sophomore Sean Geloneck had two of the best Crimson performances, as both athletes earned an invitation to the IC4A meet at Boston University in March.
Geloneck ran a personal best in the 60-meter dash, crossing the line in 6.98 seconds to take sixth. Brady, who qualified for the ECAC meet in his previous outing at the Jay Carisella Track and Field Invitational, continued his strong senior season, hurling the shot put 15.98 meters. His mark earned the co-captain fourth place overall.
“I’m happy with the shot put—it was my best season opener ever,” Brady said. “It puts me on track, but there is still more I can do. I always have very high expectations for myself.”
Another athlete with high expectations delivered in Hanover, as junior Sean Gil captured Harvard’s lone victory, finishing first in the pole vault. Gil’s height of 4.57 meters gave him an edge of 0.15 meters above his nearest competitor.
“Sean Gil winning the meet was a great performance,” Saretsky said.
Co-captain Justin Grinstead and sophomore Shannon Conway also had strong showings in the men’s and women’s 400-meter races, placing third and seventh, respectively.
Yet beyond a number of individual Crimson accomplishments, the meet also provided key opportunities for the entire team.
Leverone Field House will play host to the Heptagonal Championships later this season, and Saretsky wanted his athletes to get a sense of the track.
“For a lot of the team members, it was a chance to get into the facility that we will use for Heps,” the coach said. “We were able to get up [to Hanover] and get comfortable with it.”
In addition, as Harvard readies for the heart of its indoor season, Brady emphasized the importance of early meets like the Dartmouth Relays, which provide additional chances to compete.
“The more repetition we get with training and competing, the better we are going to do,” Brady said. “From now until the end of the year we’re going to have a pretty steady rhythm of training…For the next couple of weeks we’ll be at home, looking to build on what we did [this weekend].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being the underdog doesn’t seem to bother the Harvard men’s hockey team. For the second time in as many weeks, the Crimson welcomed a top-10 opponent to Bright Hockey Center, and for the second time, the home team came away with a win.
Harvard (3-10-2, 3-5-2 ECAC) used a three-goal run in the second period to gain control of last night’s matchup with No. 5 Yale (9-4-3, 5-2-2 ECAC) and held on for the 3-2 victory.
“Obviously we’re very happy with the win,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “Yale’s a very good team, we have a lot of respect for them…We’re really pleased with the way our guys battled.”
Again it was Harvard’s vaunted freshman class that provided the offense, with rookie Louis Leblanc scoring twice and classmate Alex Fallstrom tallying his first career goal—all in an eight-minute stretch in the second frame.
The Crimson set the tone for the offensive outburst in the first period, when sophomore Alex Killorn got a few good looks on net.
Harvard’s best scoring opportunity came on its first power play after Bulldog Broc Little was whistled for hooking. Set up in the offensive zone, the Crimson moved the puck around the horn, giving Killorn the puck on his stick right in front of the Yale net.
But the Bulldogs’ rookie netminder Jeff Malcolm got a pad on the shot, and Yale killed off the rest of the penalty without incident.
Though the Bulldogs held a 12-4 advantage in shots through the opening frame, Harvard was not discouraged.
“I thought we outplayed them in the first period,” Donato said. “I wasn’t so concerned with the shot total…They threw a lot of pucks, a lot of long shots, but I think we’re well aware that the scoreboard is different from the shot [count].”
The second period opened with Yale up a man after Crimson sophomore Ryan Grimshaw was called for a penalty in the final minute of the first. The Bulldogs’ nation-leading offense did not waste the opportunity.
Just 36 seconds into the second frame, Malcolm gave the puck to defenseman Tom Dignard, who found Sean Backman streaking up the left side of the ice. Backman skated into the Harvard zone and put a long slapshot past junior Crimson goalie Ryan Carroll for the 1-0 lead.
But Harvard seized the momentum back 88 seconds later with a power-play goal of its own.
Killorn slid a centering pass to freshman Conor Morrison, who placed the puck on Leblanc’s stick. The rookie slammed the puck past Malcolm to even the score.
Just over a minute later, the Crimson went ahead for good. Fallstrom took a pass and charged up the right side of the ice, beating Malcolm with a long shot from the faceoff circle to make the score 2-1. Grimshaw and fellow sophomore Daniel Moriarty were credited with assists.
Now in control of the game, Harvard’s first line created another score at the midway point of the period.
Junior Michael Biega crossed the puck to Grimshaw, who put a long shot on Malcolm. Though the Yale goalie stopped the first shot, Leblanc was there to put the rebound away for the 3-1 lead.
The recently-reunited top forward line of Michael Biega, Leblanc and Killorn accounted for nine of the Crimson’s 22 shots and four of its points on the night. Killorn nearly added a goal of his own in the third period, but his shot rang off the left pipe.
“We struggled looking for each other in [Saturday’s loss at Minnesota], but I know for sure tonight we clicked,” Leblanc said of his linemates. “We work hard in practice and we seem to click well.”
After the flurry of points, the game took a turn for the more physical. As the Bulldogs grew frustrated with their inability to finish shots, scuffles after the whistle and an onslaught of penalties became commonplace.
“They got away from their own game plan, and if you’re a finesse team, I think you’ve got to stick with what you’re doing,” Leblanc said. “They got bumped off the puck and gave us more opportunities to score.”
It was an interference penalty on Harvard freshman Luke Greiner that gave the Bulldogs their second goal of the night.
Yale came on strong at the end of the power play, pulling Malcolm from the net to gain a 6-on-4 advantage on a delayed penalty. And just a second after Greiner came out of the box, Little poked the puck past Carroll to bring the Bulldogs within one.
But though Yale would dominate the rest of the third period—including a shot off the stick of Denny Kearney that hit the crossbar in the game’s waning minutes—Carroll held strong in net.
The junior made 35 saves against the prolific Bulldog offense, which came into the game leading the nation with 4.27 goals per game.
“[Carroll] looked comfortable,” Donato said. “I thought he made some good saves, I thought he did a good job controlling the rebounds, and I think the whole game he looked comfortable.”
And Yale doomed itself with a late-game penalty that put it on the kill for the last minute of play. For a Harvard team that has often forfeited late-game leads, holding on for the win represents a step in the right direction.
“Third period, we’d like to continue to improve and be able to stay aggressive—that’s a little bit of work in progress,” Donato said. “[It was] probably one of our most complete games…our guys have battled and I think they got rewarded tonight.”

Cambridge residents can be a sketchy crew, and James W. Lewis may be the sketchiest among them. In 1982, seven people died in the Chicago area because some Tylenol pills they took were laced with cyanide. (CYANIDE!) The case was never solved—and the $100,000 reward offered by Johnson & Johnson for finding the culprit was never claimed. At the time, Lewis became associated with the case because he wrote a letter demanding $1 million from Johnson & Johnson to stop the killings. He spent over a decade behind bars for this act of extortion, but he was never tried or convicted for the actual murders. That may soon change.
Now, Lewis is back in the news with a book—and maybe, another round of court hearings that may settle the question of his innocence once and for all.
Last week, Lewis and his wife provided DNA samples to investigators, which may be the evidence needed to clinch the case.  WCVB Boston reported last year that the FBI has suspected that Lewis is the man behind the murders. With today's new advanced forensic technology, they may finally be able to prove it.
In the meantime, Lewis has decided to try his hand at a new career path—writing. On Sunday, he went on camera with local “BeLive: The Cambridge Rag” producer Roger A. Nicholson for an exclusive interview in order to promote his book Poison! The Doctor’s Dilemma. Sadly, the book is only available for Kindle or in paperback on Amazon.com, so you can’t boost Lewis’ sales from the COOP.
The interview lasted 48 minutes, and throughout, Lewis dodged questions from callers and Nicholson about his connection to the seven murders nearly 30 years ago.
Nicholson said he was never easy on Lewis. He told us that he accused Lewis of "being a murdering piece of shit" when he ran into him last spring. "What kind of f***ing asshole, if you're not the killer, sends the FBI on a goose chase for so many years when they could be going after the real killer?"
But when Nicholson gave Lewis the opportunity to confess during this week's interview, Lewis called Nicholson “delusional.”
Nicholson, who has worked at CCTV for over 10 years, told us that it was because of the strange camaraderie he and Lewis have built over the past several years that Lewis granted him exclusive access this week.
An avid reader of books about the FBI, Nicholson was reminded of Lewis in 2005 and admitted to cyberstalking him after he kept seeing Lewis' name pop up. Realizing he and Lewis were "practically neighbors" (Lewis moved to Cambridge after being released from prison), Nicholson met up with Lewis for a private, untaped interview in July 2007. He pounded Lewis with questions about the Tylenol killings until, Nicholson said, Lewis got pretty angry. Yet surprisingly, Lewis then granted Nicholson a public interview later that year.
That Christmas, Nicholson offered Lewis a place to stay when Lewis' wife left him homeless. Nicholson's reason for letting a possible murderer into his home was simple: “When I die, I’m pretty sure I’m going to hell," Nicholson said. "But I didn’t want it to be because I let a guy who might be innocent freeze to death by the Charles River right before Christmas,” he added with a chuckle.
Unfortunately, Nicholson says he doesn’t have plans to release the video of the 2010 interview online (he says he wants money for his hard work), so Lewis won’t become a YouTube star. At least not yet.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
Correction: Jan. 13, 2010
A previous version of this post stated incorrectly that Nicholson's comments were referring to an exchange that occurred during the televised interview with Lewis. In fact, Nicholson was referring to an earlier encounter with Lewis. 
In addition, the post incorrectly misquoted Nicholson as saying, "What kind of asshole sends the FBI on a goose chase for so many years?" In fact, Nicholson said, "What kind of f***ing asshole, if you're not the killer, sends the FBI on a goose chase for so many years when they could be going after the real killer?"
Finally, the post stated incorrectly that Nicholson first heard of Lewis in 2005. In fact, Nicholson had previously met Lewis in 1995.
Correction: Jan. 15, 2010
A previous version of this post stated incorrectly that Lewis' book, Poison! The Doctor's Dilemma, is only available for Kindle. In fact, the title is also available in paperback on Amazon.com.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
It’s only been a few days since we entered 2010, but it’s already a rough one for Yale. Iran recently listed the University as one of the subversive organizations allegedly responsible for the unrest following the nation’s “elections” last June. Apparently, Yale is one of 60 organizations involved in a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad plot to spawn civil unrest within Iran’s borders.
In other news, Peru is now suing Yale University for failing to return various artifacts taken from the Machu Picchu site years ago. It all started between 1911-15 when Hiram Bingham III (such a Yalie name) rediscovered the ancient city of Machu Picchu and began shipping things he found back to New Haven. Yale has now asked a court to dismiss the case based on a statute of limitations issue under Connecticut law, even though there is no such statute of limitations issue under Peruvian law. Again, such a Yalie move.
Also, The Yale Daily News’s blog reports that Harold Bloom, the famous academic and Shakespeare scholar of The Western Canon fame, has sadly canceled his two seminars this semester due to a severe illness and hospitalization since December.
And finally, if all this hasn’t been bad enough for Yale, the fine art auctioneer Christie’s is apparently selling a human skull that the Skull and Bones Society once used as a ballot box. Now there’s an artifact we wouldn't want.
At Stanford, The Stanford Daily—the campus’s largest and most widely circulated publication—may have engaged in a little collegiate money laundering. According to a recent investigative report in The Stanford Review based on The Daily’s IRS Form 990, the publication declared a cash balance of $517,022 in 2008 and then proceeded to transfer more than half the money to a subsidiary non-profit organization called The Friends of The Daily Foundation in order to simulate an $80,408 deficit. With the apparent deficit, The Daily then applied for and was granted $50,000 in student fees from the Stanford Student Senate, which had no idea about the large “gift” The Daily had made to its subsidiary organization.
The University of Chicago experienced its own controversy when it sent prospective applicants a sample admissions essay last month. Unfortunately, the chosen piece was written by a particularly amorous applicant, who confessed to feeling full of “that gooey sap you feel late at night” whenever he thought of his dream alma mater. Some students thought it was clever, others found it apalling, and some wanted to cry because it made them think their own essays weren't original enough.
At Princeton, students are back at school for reading period and exams. Ah yes, remember the days when that used to be us? But now, for everyone at home, lying in comfortable armchairs next to the fireplace with nothing to do, it's time to point fingers and laugh. A writer for The Daily Princetonian tries to defend post-break finals, but we're unconvinced.

Riding pantless may not be classy enough for the subways of London or France, but it clearly isn't beneath the patrons of the MBTA.
On Sunday, over 100 Bostonians stripped down to their underpants on the T as part of No Pants Subway Ride 2010, a nationwide event organized by Improv Everywhere. It’s what that crazy college student deep inside of you has secretly desired to do since arriving on this staid campus, but has refrained from doing so for many reasons—including, but not limited to, hygiene concerns, freezing temperatures, the wandering eyes of commuting skeeves, and those pesky public indecency laws.
But as manifested all too starkly on Sunday, plenty of T riders share this buried, but burning, desire to shed clothing in public. The Boston Society of Spontaneity, who organized the Boston part of the event, instructed partici"pants" to arrive at Alewife at noon, and to travel on the Red Line and pull off their pants in the process. The pantless mass traveled in groups, because, as one BSS Website sagely observed, “riding around town in your underwear by yourself (especially if you’re female) isn’t the safest thing to do.” Duly noted.
For the faint-hearted: may it be known that such brazenly naked acts of rebellion will not put you at odds with the law. "This is NOT illegal," the BBS Web site states. "Regular underwear does not constitute indecent exposure."
This isn't all fun and games, however. According to one blogger, “The first rule of No Pants Day, per its creators, is that you don’t talk about No Pants Day. You also don’t giggle, exchange significant glances, or pose for risque photos in the T you’re supposed to be pantskrieging.”
Despite BSS' lack of connection to Harvard, the pantless crusade has been mistakenly linked to Harvard in the past. In 2009, one subway minstrel assumed Harvard was involved in the gag—perhaps the result of Primal Scream lore, or the correlation between intelligence and disregard or ignorance of social norms. As he sang an impromptu song, he quizzed a scantily clad passerby, “Are you from Harvard? …No? You should be.”
But since we don't expect her to make an appearance on the T anytime soon, we'll have to fully appreciate what we do have: if we ever pass some of these formerly pantless Bostonians on the Red Line, we'll definitely give them a holler.

Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 has struck again with another op-ed panning the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body—this time in the Huffington Post.
On Tuesday, an op-ed penned by Lewis went live on the Huffington Post’s Web site with the provocative title, “Larry Summers, Robert Rubin: Will The Harvard Shadow Elite Bankrupt The University And The Country?” It is still listed as one of the most popular blog posts on the Huff Post, with over 270 comments so far.
The blog post echoes another op-ed Lewis and Computer Science Professor Fred Abernathy co-wrote for the Boston Globe in December, calling for some of Harvard’s seven Fellows (who have lifelong terms) to resign and demanding reform of Harvard’s governance structure.
Lewis largely blames the seven-person board and former President Larry Summers for Harvard’s current financial crisis—noting that the Corporation lost $3 billion by “gambling” with operating cash and making bad bets on interest rates, in addition to another $11 billion lost from the endowment. He writes about the Corporation’s notorious secretiveness (“Their meetings and agendas are unannounced, their decisions unreported”) and seeming invulnerability (“[They] serve for life if they wish and cannot be unseated by anyone except themselves).”
After outlining the Harvard in Russia scandal and criticizing Harvard Corporation member Robert Rubin, Lewis ends his piece ominously:
"The modern power elites thrive by forgetting any regrettable past. This amnesia is easy at Harvard, where the legal fiduciaries operate in secret and need not answer for their acts. They are the antipodes of the selfless institutional servants who built Harvard and other great American enterprises, and they bear close watching."
While online support has congealed around Lewis’ crusade for governance reform—an anonymous Harvard professor suggests that Lewis should be appointed to the Corporation, and Harvard blogger Richard Bradley writes that “some other folks need to start stepping up to the plate”—don’t expect Lewis to lead a rally outside Mass. Hall anytime soon.
“I’m not doing any petition drives or anything like that,” Lewis told FlyBy. “I have to go and get back to my spring-term teaching and things I’ve committed to do.”
He added that he considers himself “relatively moderate” and suggested that the Corporation can become more transparent and accountable “just by voluntarily adopting some practices and telling people what they’re doing.”
Lewis did not approach the Huffington Post himself. George Mason University Professor Janine Wedel got in touch with Lewis, asking him to write a blog post that would be part of the Huff Post’s series on the “shadow elite”—in honor of Wedel’s book Shadow Elite.  Lewis agreed, noting to FlyBy that “she’s written a lot about the Harvard in Russia scandal that I mentioned in my piece.”
“The reason why I agreed to do it was really that I’ve been disappointed that the mythologizing about the end of the Summers presidency keeps being presented as he was run out of town because of…the women in science controversy,” he explained.
Instead, Lewis said, the Harvard in Russia scandal was much more present in professors’ minds when they cast their vote of no confidence in Summers.
