“September 1, 1939” by W.H. Auden
This wartime poem, somehow at once downcast and brimming with hope, documents the end of a decade. Revisiting Auden’s words at the beginning of another demonstrated that time has yet to erode the urgency of his famous plea for compassion: “We must love one another or die.” The first stanzas depict a society marred by violence and greed — only in the conclusion does Auden present the idea of his poetry’s potential as an “affirming flame” during an international crisis, a theme that hit close to home during the early months of quarantine.

“Uncanny Valley” by Anna Wiener
Is this a memoir about the insidiousness of Silicon Valley — a place in which morals fall by the wayside thanks to the reverence we have for “move fast and break things,” “optimization,” and “innovation?” Yes. Is it thus a little existentially thought-provoking? Yes. Did I also read it at least three times by summer’s end? Also yes. Anna Wiener spent a few years working for an unnamed company in San Francisco, all the while craving deeper human connections and meaningful interactions. Expect to be moved by her clarion call for simpler pleasures.
— Cassandra Luca
We reviewed “Uncanny Valley” and gave it 5 stars.
“The Limits of What We Can Do” by Natalie Eilbert
In “The Limits of What We Can Do,” poet Natalie Eilbert outlines the audacity and inevitability of having needs. Eilbert’s is a poem uniquely suited for white-collar quarantiners, who watched the world burn from armchairs: “The Limits of What We Can Do” pokes at artifice, self-absorption, and the guilt that lies beneath. Eilbert is hard on her angst-ridden narrator. But the poem also has an earnest streak, a sense that even people mired with restlessness and orneriness and anxiety are doing their best. Eilbert tells readers — gently, in the end — how to think about and for themselves while the external world crowds out internal narratives. “I throw up yarn / and go for a run,” the poem concludes. “A love inside of me is breaking.”

“Zami: A New Spelling of My Name” by Audre Lorde
If you haven’t read anything by Audre Lorde yet, her beautiful 1982 biomythography is a good place to start. Lorde weaves together her own experiences with those of women she has known and loved to paint a vivid and gripping portrait of her life as a Black lesbian woman in New York City in the mid-20th century. In “Zami,” Lorde analyzes and reimagines motherhood, race, gender, friendship, and love in all its many forms, culminating in a deeply personal and poetic work. For those of us inclined to spend the early months of quarantine thinking, crying, and feeling full, this book was the perfect fit.
— Allison J. Scharmann
“Anna Karenina” by Leo Tolstoy
“You might have the time but not the mental bandwidth for ‘Anna Karenina’ right now, and that’s OK,” the New York Times writes in a significantly more elaborate version of this supplement. I’d argue that neither time nor mental bandwidth have been in ample supply for the past year. Nonetheless, give “Anna Karenina” a chance. Tolstoy’s most archetypal novel is not only unexpectedly readable but also conveniently divided into bite-sized pieces for your low-capacity consumption, with chapters clocking in between two and seven pages. If you start today and read one chapter per night, you’ll finish before New Years, so the book can double as a backup calendar in case the end of days is nigh.
— Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
“The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair” by Joël Dicker
Originally published in French, this tome is ideal for Agatha Christie fans who want to ruminate over her murder mysteries. It clocks in at about 700 pages, but quarantine has given us plenty of time. Add in a cold case that Marcus Goldman, our hero, must investigate, and you’ll forget about that “essential” reading you have for class. Author Joel Dicker paces the novel perfectly, and for fans, there are sequels too. Bonus points if you read it in French.
— Cassandra Luca
“The Road” by Cormac McCarthy
In McCarthy’s 2006 post-apocalyptic Pulitzer Prize winner, a man (“the man”) and his son (“the boy”) traverse a hellscape so barren and void of goodness it makes modern America look like… well, the America of two months ago. Unlike us, the man and the boy are ecstatic to find a bunker where they can sit alone with a supply of canned food. Exactly like us, the man knows he is dying because he has a pervasive dry cough. Read this one for solidarity, not comfort — or because, according to the Guardian’s reviewer, “All the modern novel can do is done here.”
— Iris M. Lewis
We recommended “The Road” in a staff rec in 2014.
“all about love” by bell hooks
bell hooks’ beautiful book centers on the idea that we’ve lost sight of what love truly means. It’s a noun and an abstract feeling, but it is also a verb — meaning that perhaps we must focus more on how we show love, not necessarily how we conceive of it. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of how love is manifested, arguing, in sum, that emotional fulfillment requires vulnerability, trust, recognition, and respect. Whether single, quarantining with a partner, or missing your partner greatly, her ideas will change you.
— Cassandra Luca
“The Soloist” by Mark Salzman
Salzman’s “The Soloist” is a quiet, self-contained book about a man quietly, self-contained-ly losing his sanity. Renne is a child cello prodigy who falls apart upon adulthood. When he simultaneously gains a nine-year-old protégé and a spot on the jury of a murder trial, he must reckon with the forces that shape children into adults. The result is a gentle text with an disquietingly unreliable narrator — but the real selling point for “The Soloist” is Salzman’s love for the cello, which makes for a resonant addition to an already gripping novel.
— Iris M. Lewis
“They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us” by Hanif Abdurraqib
Hanif Abdurraqib’s book of essays is a must-read for anyone who enjoys music, cultural criticism, basketball, or just plain ’ol beautiful writing. Tied to no one subject or theme, Abdurraqib pays homage to Prince’s performance at Super Bowl XLI, reports from the audience at a Carly Rae Jepsen concert, and describes, in intimate detail, the moment Allen Iverson hit Michael Jordan with a crossover. He is guided by punk rock, by the state of Ohio, by music and love and grief as he tells one beautiful story after another. Pick up the book, flip through the pages, and let your finger fall on an essay — you won’t be able to read just one.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We reviewed “They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us” and gave it 5 stars.

“Fleabag”
If you haven’t heard of “Fleabag,” you just might be alone. The Amazon Studios/BBC Three collaboration is a star vehicle for English actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who nabbed three Emmys in 2019 for creating, writing, and starring in the series. The show follows a woman known only as “Fleabag” (Waller-Bridge) on a quest for self-love and forgiveness after a tragic loss. Waller-Bridge is simultaneously devastating and deadpan as the show’s protagonist, and her writing strikes a deft balance between tragedy and levity. “Fleabag” is one of those rare shows that 100 percent lives up to its hype.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We reviewed Season Two and named it our #1 TV Show of 2019.
“Schitt’s Creek”
“Schitt’s Creek” may have aired its final episode on Apr. 7, 2020, but a year into the pandemic, it’s not too late to binge-watch all six seasons of this very Canadian comedy. Like a warm blanket, the show’s gentle humor has proven an unrivaled quarantine companion for everything from morning baking to midnight baking to screaming into the void. The rare show to pick up steam as it went along, “Schitt’s Creek” owes much of its success to the instantly iconic character of family matriarch Moira Rose (played by Catherine O’Hara with soap-star bravura and an implacable highfalutin accent). Wondering where O’Hara has been all your life? Go watch “Best in Show” (2000) and consider this a two-in-one recommendation.
— Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
“7 Days Out”
As major events around the world got cancelled, guests and organizers alike lamented their preparations. Netflix’s 2018 documentary series “7 Days Out,” which covers the week of procedures, preparations, and stress leading up to some of these international events, proved cathartic. Each episode features every possible angle: spectators, experts, institution presidents, critics, and competitors themselves. Watch the world’s most coveted dogs prep for their showing at Westminster; dive into the frantic world of designers, models, and organizers in Paris Fashion Week’s CHANEL Haute Couture show; or catch the drama leading up to the “most dramatic two minutes in sports:” the Kentucky Derby.
— Hannah T. Chew
“The End of the F***ing World”
Few shows have mastered the art of cutting away at the worst possible moment as well as “The End of the F***ing World.” Not only was its name a little too relevant this year, but its masterful balance of nail-biting plot and rich, focused character development makes it the perfect apocalyptic binge. Throughout its two seasons, the show’s intimate, dysfunctional dialogue always leaves something unsaid, bringing a brutal realism to its addictive, over-the-top plot. “The End of the F***king World” may just rip your heart out — but only because its deeply traumatized, violently earnest protagonists become impossible not to love.
— Joy C. Ashford
“Kim’s Convenience”
This CBC sitcom about a Korean-Canadian family from Toronto released its fourth season on Netflix last year at just the right time. The show, based on Ins Choi’s play of the same name, is a hilarious and heartwarming account of the Kim family’s day-to-day antics — from stealing the neighbor’s WiFi to giving Korean wedgies to exploring Asian identity. It’s a fresh take on the sitcom genre, a binge-worthy challenger to classics like “The Office” or “Friends,” and a perfect quarantine companion.
— Kalos K. Chu
We named “Kim’s Convenience” our #10 TV Show of 2018 and covered a panel featuring its cast members here.
“Law and Order: Special Victims Unit”
With 470 episodes and counting (all of which are available with a Hulu subscription), “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” is one of the most bingeable shows to watch during quarantine. The series follows a group of New York City detectives who solve cases of a sexual nature. “Law and Order: Special Victims Unit” is known for using stories “ripped from the headlines,” often modeling its episodes after popular real-world cases not too long after these cases make the news. Although a 21-season-long police procedural drama might not have been the escapist fantasy you were craving during weeks of self-isolation, it did, and does, have enough episodes to keep us occupied until this is all over.
— Annie Harrigan
“Feel Good”
There is something truly special about Mae Martin’s hilarious, dysfunctional masterpiece. It may be the raw, exposed nerve endings that linger under every lacerating joke or the sense of violent, restless urgency Martin brings to every scene. Or perhaps it’s something simpler: Amidst the absurdity of backyard shoebox fires or family trauma-ridden amusement rides, the show is delightfully normal. With everyday intimacy, “Feel Good” provides nuanced, thoughtful, necessary representation of nonbinary people and queer relationships. And it does so without othering its beloved characters — rather, it wraps their particular story up in the universal messiness of love.
— Joy C. Ashford
“The Sopranos” 
In the wise words of comedian Dana Donnelly: “sopranos is gossip girl for men. don’t tell me it’s more ‘elevated’ bc it’s not. the characters are just uglier.” Still, it can’t be denied that this HBO series about the Italian-American New Jersey mobster Tony Soprano is likely the most critically acclaimed television show of all time. The late actor James Gandolifini portrays the show’s legendary protagonist, while Edie Falco and Lorraine Bracco give rockstar performances as Soprano’s wife (Carmela) and therapist (Dr. Jennifer Melfi). Whether for mafia-media fanatics or those who had never heard the phrase “wise guy” in their lives, “The Sopranos” proved a perennial quarantine re-watch. At the very least, Livia Soprano (Nancy Marchand) just might inspire you to give your mother a call.
— Allison J. Scharmann 
In a satirical Best of the Decade article, we named “The Sopranos” the Best TV Show Set In New Jersey.
“Downton Abbey”
If watching family drama unfold before your eyes is your guilty pleasure, but you’re too classy to watch “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” “Downton Abbey” is a perfect alternative. Old English aristocratic life is boldy portrayed in “Downton Abbey” through the Crawley family’s lavish dinner parties and maintenance of their estate. An added layer of transparency is afforded to viewers through storylines involving the estate staff, creating a dichotomy between the life of those in service below and the privileged family above. If not for the wholly engrossing storylines found in the series, you should watch “Downton Abbey” simply to hear Maggie Smith’s hilariously shady quips as the Dowager Countess.
— Chibuike K. Uwakwe
“Glee”
Before Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk made “American Horror Story,” they created a different horror show: “Glee.” The prolific musical-dramedy about a fledgling high school show choir ran for six seasons from 2009-2015, launching the careers of an ensemble of young actors including Lea Michele, Darren Criss, and the late, great Naya Rivera. The show’s early seasons are notable for their biting humor, stunning musical numbers, and themes of high school naiveté. Not every episode aged well, but the ones that did are delightful to watch a decade later. If you’re looking to escape reality for a few hours, consider giving the show a watch (or re-watch). After all, there are few things more removed from reality than “Glee.”

“The Grand Budapest Hotel” (2014)
Wes Anderson doesn’t get much better than “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” the film which netted the famed director his first Best Picture and Best Director nominations at the Oscars. Its hyper-saturated color palettes, intricate production design, shallow depth of field, and incessantly symmetrical compositions exemplify what we have come to expect from the auteur. As with many of Anderson’s films, "The Grand Budapest Hotel" also features a standout ensemble cast led by Ralph Fiennes, who plays against-type as the effortlessly affable M. Gustave. Alexandre Desplat’s rustic score buoys the film’s infectious, old-school charm.
— Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and gave it 4 stars.
“Rent” (2005) 
Derided by critics as overproduced and pretentious, this film adaptation of the beloved musical deserves another round in the spotlight. Its theatrical flair is far from out of place: “Rent” embraces its Broadway beginnings with real spirit. As its protagonists, impoverished young artists in New York City, experience the devastation of the AIDS epidemic, their paths meet to tell a poignant story of love and loss. Even in its darkest moments, the film never abandons the carpe-diem message of its heartwarming finale: “No day but today.”
— Clara V. Nguyen 
“The Lobster” (2015)
Yorgos Lanthimos makes strange films. In “The Lobster,” individuals who check into a mysterious hotel are given 45 days to find a romantic partner, otherwise they are turned into animals. Hotel guests can extend their 45-day limit by hunting single people who live in the forest. As one might expect, the hotel is under a stringent set of rules upheld with brutal punishment. Starring Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz as a deadpan couple, Lanthimos’ film is ridiculously original and incredibly dark. No wonder it catapulted him into Hollywood.
— Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed “The Lobster” at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival and gave it 4.5 stars.
“The Irishman” (2019)
Remember when Martin Scorsese’s mafia epic “The Irishman” dropped in 2019? And how everyone was talking about how it was almost three-and-a-half hours long? And how it was easy, in a pre-quarantine world, simply to pretend that you watched it because it’s so long no one could hold you to remembering any particular scene? Well, now is as good a time as any to catch up. The film isn’t Scorsese’s best, but it’s still pretty great, and Joe Pesci coming out of retirement to act in it is reason enough to give it a watch.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We reviewed it and gave it 5 stars.
“Call Me By Your Name” (2017)
How lovely it would be to be lounging our days away “somewhere in Northern Italy” in 1983 rather than within the confines of our homes, our attention glued to Zoom rather than to the Italian countryside and a young Bach’s musings. This is exactly where Luca Guadagnino’s 2017 film, “Call Me By Your Name,” transports its audience, taking them far from wherever they are and supplanting them squarely in a timeless idyll. If the sounds of Sufjan Stevens and ‘80s glam pop aren’t enough reprieve from the now, the breathtaking scenes of an Italian summer spent basking in the sun provide a much needed escape.
— Sofia Andrade
“Children of Men” (2006)
Cuarón doesn’t make films often — he’s only made five in the last 22 years, and each one is distinct from the last — but each one bears the searing stamp of someone deep in love with their craft. Set in a dystopian future where pandemic infertility causes mankind to crawl to an unceremonious end, “Children of Men” is as tense as it is thought provoking. Here, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki’s long unbroken takes communicate a seething, prescient sense of danger, especially in a car escape scene where the camera defies the laws of physics. “Children of Men” is a demanding film, but Cuarón always respects the audience’s intelligence, making his film a challenge worth solving.
— Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed it and gave it 4 stars.
“Frozen II” (2019)
Everyone loves “Frozen II,” a breathtakingly dazzling visual spectacle and all-around cinematic masterpiece. Kids love it because it’s a Disney movie, parents love it because it’s actually pretty funny, and gay uncles love it because of its catchy musical numbers. It’s a family movie in the most sincere sense of the word and, as such, the perfect addition to your quarantine lineup.
— Kalos K. Chu
We reviewed it and gave it 5 stars.
“The Lives of Others” (2006)
Have you ever felt like you were being watched — even when you were alone? “The Lives of Others” explores the history of that reality in East Germany during the height of the Cold War, this time through the eyes of a Stasi officer, Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), who’s convinced that a local playwright is anti-communist. Surprisingly, the film manages to humanize Wiesler as he grows oddly attached to the lives of the very culprits he swore to convict. Donnersmarck shoots his film with a depersonalized, industrial grey filter, which compounds Wiesler’s initial emotional detachment and the general artificiality in a state where no personal secret is ever safe.
— Lanz Aaron G. Tan
We reviewed it and gave it 4 stars.
“The Adventures of Food Boy” (2008)
If nothing else, social distancing gives us time to sit, think deeply, and ask ourselves life’s essential questions: Why are we here? And what happened to the guy who played Ryan in “High School Musical?” Our quest to answer both of those questions naturally leads us to one of the strangest movies ever made: “The Adventures of Food Boy.” Lucas Grabeel stars as Ezra, a seemingly normal teenager until he discovers that he has a superpower — the ability to shoot food out of his hands. The film follows Ezra’s efforts to harness his powers despite initial struggles, including an unforgettable scene in which he accidentally floods the school bathroom with mustard. Before the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there was Food Boy. Simpler times indeed.
— Connor S. Dowd
“Lost in Translation” (2003)
Separation is a key motif in writer-director-producer Sofia Coppola’s magnum opus; she uses glass and reflections to signify the emotional dissonance between her American characters and their diametrically opposed surroundings in Japan. “Lost in Translation” is about the spontaneous moments that breathe life into our existence — how, despite their ephemerality, the impact of these moments lingers long after they have passed. Coppola became just the 11th woman to win Best Original Screenplay and only the third to be nominated for Best Director at the Academy Awards for this film. So “for relaxing times, make it Suntory time.”

“Suga” by Megan Thee Stallion
Hot girl quarantine lives on: Megan Thee Stallion has proven to be the perfect upgrade to our moody social isolation playlists. Her 2020 album “Suga” refines the fearless energy of her earlier music into a polished, infectious set of instant hits. Rap along to relentless anthems like “B.I.T.C.H.” and “Captain Hook,” or sit back and enjoy the effortless energy of “Savage” and “Hit My Phone.” Dripping with swagger and self-love, “Suga” is sure to get you off the couch and onto the (TikTok) dance floor.
— Joy C. Ashford
We reviewed “Suga” and gave it 4.5 stars.
“Future Nostalgia” by Dua Lipa 
Dua Lipa broke the internet — or at least appeared to — with the early 2020 release of her second studio album, “Future Nostalgia.” Each of the album’s 11 songs is a bop, tied together by eclectic, danceable basslines and infectious lyrics. “Pretty Please,” “Hallucinate,” “Love Again,” and “Break My Heart” are highlights, showing off Dua Lipa’s self-assured, sultry vocals. It’s almost cruel that an album primed to underscore making out with a stranger on the dancefloor was delivered to us in isolation. In the age of social distancing, dancing to “Don’t Start Now” in our bedrooms will have to suffice.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We reviewed “Future Nostalgia” and called it a “genuine joy.”
“808s & Heartbreak” by Kanye West
When rapper Kanye West channeled the heartbreak of his mother’s tragic death and the dissolution of his engagement into a knotty, lugubrious, minimalist yet heavily Auto-Tuned album that offered very little in the way of actual rap, his critics and contemporaries feasted. Twelve years later, endless thinkpieces posit “808s and Heartbreak” as a genre-shaping masterpiece that paved the way for the entirety of emo-tinged modern hip-hop. If you haven’t listened to the album in full recently, isolation is the perfect time to queue it up. Over sparse, thumping beats, a plaintive West has never sounded so alone.
— Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
When we ranked Kanye West’s albums, we put “808s & Heartbreak” at number two.
“Heard It In A Past Life” by Maggie Rogers
When you’re cooped up at home, sitting and thinking, isolation and loneliness seem inevitable. Maggie Rogers’ debut album “Heard It In A Past Life” may not be the newest release, but her otherworldly voice and stirring lyrics have proven perfect for relieving the claustrophobia of quarantine. “Alaska” brings forth hope, a deep appreciation for the sublimity of nature, and reflection in isolation. Energy courses through the album, from the pulses and mesmerizing background vocals of “Give A Little,” to the undeniable pull and earth-moving power of Roger’s voice in “Say It.” The hopeful soul and unadulterated anguish of this album is bound, in this time of confined movement, to help one feel “Back In [Their] Body.”
— Hannah T. Chew
We reviewed “Heard It In A Past Life” and gave it 5 stars.
“Wish You Were Here” by Pink Floyd
If any album can transport you somewhere else, it’s Pink Floyd’s “Wish You Were Here.” It is an album of epic proportions, ranging from soft guitar ballads like the titular “Wish You Were Here” to the industrial rock classic “Welcome to the Machine.” Every song on the five-track album is a standout, and from the opening track, “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Pts. 1-5),” Pink Floyd invites you to lose yourself in glittering psychedelia. “Wish You Were Here” — which is no doubt a thought in all our minds — is sweet and soft and no doubt one of Floyd’s most famous songs. The album showcases Pink Floyd’s incredible musicality, and for the uninitiated, there’s never been a better time to start a deep dive into its discography.
— Sofia Andrade
“Tommy Genesis” by Tommy Genesis
Tommy Genesis’ eponymous album is one to be played on repeat, letting the rhythm wash over you again and again. It’s easy to do so, given the way the album is designed: One song blends right into another. You can, of course, play them in isolation — “100 Bad,” “I’m Yours,” “Miami,” and “Rainbow” are particularly iconic. If you get bored of the album, venture further into her Spotify catalogue to discover a mishmash of singles that showcase her simultaneous vulnerability and hard outer shell. Truly a contender for Yardfest 2021.
— Cassandra Luca
“Queen” by Nicki Minaj
One thing I love about Nicki Minaj is her intellect as a rapper. All of her rap verses are filled with metaphors, double entendres, and word play, forcing those who listen to her to think critically. If you want a taste of the “Queen of Rap,” spend some time listening to her last album, “Queen.” Start with “Barbie Dreams” for some old-school quintessential rap with a mix sampled from The Notorious B.I.G.'s “Just Playing (Dreams).” As you listen through the album, pay close attention to “Hard White” and “Chun Swae,” some prime examples of her unmatched delivery and flow as a rapper.
— Chibuike K. Uwakwe
We reviewed “Queen” and called it “its own war of attrition.”
“Lemonade” by Beyoncé
Where were you when Beyoncé dropped “Lemonade” in 2016? If you have taste, you were frantically refreshing HBO On Demand, desperate to watch the visual album accompanying what would come to be known as a defining album not just of 2016, but of the 21st century. The years have been kind to Beyoncé’s sixth studio album — who else could convince us all to get trial subscriptions to Tidal? — even if the Grammys were not. Relive the moment it dropped the first time. Bask in the badassery that is Beyoncé, Serena Williams, Amandla Stenberg, Zendaya, and more incredible women in so many visual, musical, and poetic odes to Black womanhood. You won’t regret it.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We named “Lemonade” our top album of 2016.
“Dirty Computer” by Janelle Monae
Perfect for some much needed escapism, Janelle Monae’s Afro-futurist concept album “Dirty Computer” transports you into a “Black Mirror”-esque future in which humans, now known as “computers,” are forced to conform to the standards of an evil governing body. Songs like “Crazy, Classic, Life” and “Django Jane” are rife with pro-Black and pro-femme political commentary and show off Monae’s impeccable rap flow. “Make Me Feel,” a collaboration by Monae and the late Prince, is a sultry and danceable track with a funky guitar part reminiscent of Prince’s own style. The story of “Dirty Computer” is made complete by the album’s accompanying “emotion picture.” The 48 minute narrative film featuring Monae and actress Tessa Thompson is made up of music videos for each track on the album sewn together. Watch it here.
— Annie Harrigan
We reviewed “Dirty Computer” and gave it 4.5 stars.
“Pure Heroine” by Lorde
Are you draping “your wrists over the steering wheel”? Or are you “riding bikes like little kids”? Whatever you’ve done to remain “Still Sane” in quarantine, Lorde’s debut album “Pure Heroine” is an apt companion. Released when the New Zealand singer-songwriter was just 16 years old, “Pure Heroine” was the original manifesto for Gen-Z adolescent ambivalence and suburban monotony, just in time for the eldest pre-millenium babies to drive aimlessly while listening to it. Revisit the ultimate underscore for your high school boredom, your summer sadness, your adolescent yearning. Take a drive, or a bike ride, around your hometown or your new haunt. Let the music guide you.
— Allison J. Scharmann
We wrote a five-year retrospective on “Pure Heroine” where we wrote that the album “broke through 2013’s dystopian escapism.”

NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts
Few things soothe the soul quite like these short, acoustic concerts put on by some of your favorite artists at the titular tiny desk in NPR’s Washington, D.C. office. The true beauty of these concerts lies in their ability to showcase the astounding musicianship of artists who may not be used to performing in such intimate settings without digitized instruments. Megan Thee Stallion’s unrelenting energy brings “Hot Girl Summer” to an office full of public radio broadcasters; T-Pain, notorious for his use of autotune, proves himself to be a tremendous singer without it; the late Mac Miller’s performance of “2009,” accompanied by a string section, will break your heart in the most beautiful way possible.

Museum Instagrams
In order to remedy the boredom and lack of scenery changes during quarantine, museums around the world are creating new ways for patrons to interact with their collections. Instead of strolling through the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s galleries, the @metmuseum Instagram page’s posts and stories encourage patrons to learn more about featured artists, exhibitions, and hidden tales behind the collection. Museums like the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (@sfmoma) are releasing short videos and gallery tours with the hashtag #MuseumFromHome, giving patrons around the world the opportunity to learn about the collections without leaving their couch.

Into the Gloss Top Shelfs
Skincare fanatics will want to pay attention (though perhaps, if you’re one of them, you already regularly peruse the site). Into the Gloss has been giving insider tips into the routines of celebrities like Jia Tolentino and people like you and me for years, as well as monthly favorite product roundups, open threads for people in the comments to chime in, and in-depth looks at specific types of products. Once you go down the rabbit hole, it’s addictive (I myself have gotten to page 67), but you’ll learn a lot about pH, moisture barriers, and different types of acids. For visual creatures, the accompanying photography is just as good, and will leave you wishing you could be featured on their site.

Simple Mac N’ Cheese
Yes, there are recipes that call for Le Creuset lookalike pans, breadcrumbs, and three kinds of cheese, and no one is disputing their enshrinement in the comfort food Hall of Fame. But when you want something cozy now and Kraft just isn’t cutting it — no powdered cheese for you, thanks, you’re gonna go designer — just toss some pasta in a pot, let it boil, drain it. Shred some cheese, preferably gooey when melted, and mix it together while the pasta is still hot. Top with salt and pepper. Simple, unfussy, fast — made all the more satisfying because of the minimal effort required. Eat it three times a day if you want, we won’t judge.

“To L and Back,” a Podcast
Does self-quarantine already have you talking to yourself? If so, consider putting on Autostraddle’s “To L and Back” podcast to keep you company. On each installment, hosts Riese Bernard and Carly Usdin (Kristin Russo co-hosted Season One) break down one episode of the groundbreaking Showtime series “The L Word,” which followed the lives of a melodramatic group of lesbian women in Los Angeles. Bernard and Usdin’s commentary is the perfect companion to the show, whether you’re a long-time fan or watching for the first time. Stream an episode on Netflix, then find the corresponding episode and go about your day. Your government-approved walk just got so much better!

Architectural Digest Home Tours
Forget “Tiger King.” The Internet’s most underrated shock-doc is an Architectural Digest Youtube series called “Open Door: Inside Celebrity Homes.” Did you know that Chelsea Handler has an outdoor pizza oven? Or that Robert Downey Jr.’s Hamptons house is literally inside a windmill? And how can I score an invite to Lenny Kravitz’s sprawling Brazilian farm compound? The perversely grotesque pleasure of peering into very rich people’s most intimate spaces is inexhaustible. At a moment when the idea of entering anyone else’s home at all incites both terror and nostalgia, these videos remind us of a time when people (or camera crews) could just swing by and be welcomed with open, well-rehearsed arms.
— Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
Impressionist Classical Music
Most people were first exposed to impressionist classical music when they heard Debussy’s “Clair de lune,” or perhaps they saw “Call Me by Your Name” and were enamored by Ravel’s “Une barque sur l'océan.” Impressionism in classical music is enchanting because composers are able to etch an image — an impression if you will — into the minds of listeners using texture in sound, often deviating from practices characteristic of the Classical and Romantic periods. I encourage you to delve into “Arabesque No. 1” and “Rêverie” by Debussy or “Jeux D’eau” and “Le Tombeau de Couperin” by Ravel during this time in quarantine. Or if you’re tired of listening to just Debussy and Ravel, I suggest taking a look at Lili Boulanger’s masterworks.

“2 Dope Queens,” a Podcast
I am a firm believer that podcasts are bad and those who recommend them are worse. This podcast, in my humble opinion, is one of the few exceptions to the rule. Co-hosts Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson are flat-out hilarious on this WNYC Studios series — so funny, in fact, that HBO filmed and aired a four-part special of the series in 2019. Their rotating guest list of actors, comedians, and other public figures keep the show fresh and, in the case of Jon Hamm, flirty. If you’re listening in public, beware! Laughing to yourself is still going to look strange, even from six feet away.

Whatever Your Local Arts Organizations Are Doing
I know. This is a lecture and not a recommendation. But listen: Your local bookstores (and movie theaters, and museums) do important work, both by employing people and by bringing you culture. If you have the money, you should help them out during These Trying Times — they deserve it, and you will walk away with a new way to spend your hours. In Boston, the arts sector creates almost as many jobs as the retail industry. Both sectors are struggling right now, but only one will send you personalized book recommendations. In conclusion: Buy local!

“Passionfruit” by Drake
Over a smooth, tropical beat, Drake sings about being “passionate from miles away” — a condition with which we all can empathize as we have striven to maintain relationships from a healthy distance. If the original recording isn’t quite your style, check out one of the many covers by other notable artists including Paramore, Yaeji, and even John Mayer. The song’s distinctly warm and sunny atmosphere has offered an antidote to long hours stuck indoors, while its lyrics chronicle many of the difficulties inherent in long-distance relationships. Although it seems he’s currently more interested in making songs destined to go viral on TikTok, Drake’s “Passionfruit” serves up reliable sonic escapism from a frustrating time.

“Wasteland, Baby” by Hozier
The titular track from Hozier’s second studio album, “Wasteland, Baby” is a song about falling in love at the end of the world. Over a soft, melodic guitar, Hozier sings about being blind to surrounding apocalyptic destruction while he’s with the person he loves. This love is just as powerful as the apocalypse itself when he sings the opening lines “All the fear and the fire of the end of the world / Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl.” When I saw Hozier in concert in Nov. 2019, he said that he would like to believe the last ever human act would be one of love. During isolation — what feels like it may be the end of the world — we are all yearning for a love as true as the one Hozier sings about.

“Auld Lang Syne” by Sufjan Stevens
Stevens puts an eclectic spin on the New Year’s classic, whose lyrics about remembrance and promises to meet again ring especially true in a year of unexpected isolation. For a popular holiday tune, “Auld Lang Syne” begins with a surprisingly weighty question: “Should old acquaintance be forgot / And never brought to mind?” Stevens doesn’t think so: With his characteristic charm and a banjo solo to boot, his version opts for merriment over melancholy. It’s a celebration of both future friendships and, of course, days of auld lang syne.

“New Apartment” by Ari Lennox 
Ari Lennox’s sunny, satiating “New Apartment” posits what has become a radical theory: That being isolated inside 800 square feet of space is pretty great. Sure, many of us haven’t been outside in a year — but Lennox contends that being indoors is its own kind of freedom. The result is an offbeat ode to Dollar Tree wine glasses, leaving dishes in the sink, and paying for your own electric bill. It is the song’s spoken outro, however, that makes “New Apartment” so apt for the isolation era. “Your furniture is not gonna fucking have sex with you... It's not gonna teach you how to swim. It's not gonna teach you how to roller skate,” Lennox says, placing exaggerated emphasis on every word. “And then I realized, oh my God, I need people.”

“Dedicated To The One I Love” by The Mamas & The Papas
Already an established anthem for long-distance couples, The Mamas & The Papas’ “Dedicated To The One I Love” is an endlessly sweet song for anyone who finds themselves far away from loved ones, whether they be separated by self-isolation or state lockdowns. The song is built on layers of ethereal harmonies over a booming band. “When I’m away from you my baby / I know it’s hard for you my baby / Because it’s hard for you my baby / And the darkest hour is right before dawn,” sings the four-person folk vocal group over and over in the song’s chorus, giving us solace from within the confines of our rooms as well as the hope that it won’t be for much longer.

“Make that Cake” by LunchMoney Lewis feat. Doja Cat
If you are anything like me, you have coped with isolation by spending countless hours in the kitchen baking cookies, cakes, breads, and pretty much anything else you could conjure up with the ingredients you have available. While it is probably not about baking actual cakes, “Make that Cake” by LunchMoney Lewis featuring Doja Cat is the perfect upbeat rap track to dance to in your kitchen as you wait for the cake you just put in the oven to rise. The repetitive chorus “Make that cake, make that cake / Make that cake, make that cake” has been just the encouragement we needed when debating whether or not to bake your 15th dessert of the week.
— Annie Harrigan
“Life in Quarantine” by Benjamin Gibbard
The Death Cab for Cutie frontman’s lyrics have always been perceptive, so it’s no wonder this quarantine-era single painted such a poignant, chilling portrait of life in the shadow of Covid-19. Accompanied only by soft acoustic guitar — even the song’s instrumentation suggests seclusion and self-sufficiency — Gibbard describes the pandemic’s upheaval of society, contrasting the frenzy of crowded supermarkets with the otherwise all-consuming emptiness. Future historians may very well turn to Gibbard’s account of what he calls “these days of no guarantees.”
— Clara V. Nguyen
“Did I Let You Know” by The Red Hot Chili Peppers
“Did I Let You Know” is the perfect song to both wake you up before your 9:00 a.m. class and transport you to your canceled spring break trip. It’s characterized by Chad Smith’s powerful, marimba-esque drumming and Josh Klinghoffer’s surf rock guitar riffs. Like Rupert Holmes’s “Escape (The Pina Colada Song)” or Sublime’s “Santeria,” “Did I Let You Know” transports you to sunny days spent baking in the hot sand or amongst the waves, a perfect pick me up during days spent stuck inside.
— Sofia Andrade
“Crazy House” by Princess Nokia 
Although Princess Nokia most likely did not predict the pandemic while writing their third studio album, “Everything Sucks,” they perfectly captured a major sentiment of quarantine with that title alone. With lyrics like “Let me out of the crazy house / Let me out of the crazy house, let me out,” the album’s second track, “Crazy House,” speaks to how we are all feeling on the nth day of isolation. “Everything Sucks” is the edgy and angry collection of songs we need until this is all over and we can queue Nokia’s fourth studio album “Everything is Beautiful” (released on the same day as “Everything Sucks”) again.
— Annie Harrigan
“Gone” by Charli XCX
“Gone,” a soaring, hyper-charged collaboration between Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens, contains the only fun breakdown I’ve experienced this week. The song starts with a conventional pop bass line, accelerates up toward an unstable, indie-infused chorus, and then devolves into a highly synthesized electronic coda. The ending, like the song itself, is incoherent. But it conveys the song’s general spirit, which has to do with anxiety and malaise and wringing empowerment from whatever you can. “It feels like one big external scream,” Charli wrote of the piece on her Instagram right before its release. Fitting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone has some stories to tell in their life, and so do I. Growing up in communist China as a Uighur citizen, I witnessed how a political system impacts one’s choices and how a social transformation brings changes to an individual’s thinking about life, fate, society, and the world.
Comparing what is happening to Uighurs now with that of the 1980s and early 1990s, I am convinced that those decades were the best time for Uighur people in the so-called “Uighur Autonomous Region” under communist Chinese rule. China at the time was led by relatively liberal communist leaders who took a bold step to usher the nation into a new era: an era in which China was introduced to the world, and the world, in turn, started to find out more about this ancient, mysterious, and in some sense, contemporary China.
These reforms also let individual Chinese citizens have more free thought, ambition, and colorful ideas, which was a sharp deviation from orthodox communist ideology. Like millions of youths in China at the time, Uighur youth like me began to learn English, listened to foreign music, and planted the seeds of freedom in our hearts. Basically, we longed for the freedom that would enable us to have a life we would love to live.
It was only in my college years that I started to learn English by myself. I remember listening to foreign music and songs like Paul Simon’s “The Sound of Silence.” I was so fond of this song that I learned its lyrics by heart — “People talking without speaking. People hearing without listening.” Reciting those helped me to improve my English skills and motivated me to use my time to fight for personal freedom.
My investment in learning English paid off well. I moved to Boston to study at Northeastern University, the access to scholarship made possible by my new language acquisition. And then, like generations of immigrants before me, I settled in this great city and made it my home. Almost two decades have passed since then, and so many things have changed.
My fate has changed for the better, but my people’s fate has changed for the worse. It has probably reached the nadir in their history.
China has built concentration camps for Uighur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz people since 2017 and detained as many as a million of them, sentencing their scholars, entrepreneurs, and community leaders to lengthy jail terms using various trumped-up charges and sham trials. The Chinese government’s collective oppression of these people has reached an unbearable point, and Uighurs abroad like me have been left to anguish. To our dismay, the world seemingly descended into silence. Uighurs cried for help, but the world turned deaf — everywhere we looked at, there was a silence, a dreadful silence.
It was then I rediscovered the value of that song — The Sound of Silence. More than half a century after this song was written, humankind is still unable to love each other. This reality manifests itself as the Chinese government commits mass atrocities against Uighurs. Few international or religious organizations said anything substantial. The very countries that Uighur citizens traveled to fell into virtual silence when China began to imprison those same people upon their return to China.
Looking at this vicious tragedy that my people are facing, out of hopelessness and helplessness, I murmur these lines from the song sometimes:
“No one dared disturb the sound of silence. Fools, said I, You do not know, Silence like a cancer grows.”
I don’t know how many times I’ve sung this song, which was widely popular among Harvard students in the 1960s, while I was trying to find some comfort — somehow, I felt like Paul Simon sang this song for Uighurs.
However, I have noticed some beautiful souls at Harvard started to break that silence in the past two years.
I want to thank Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow for reminding China that Harvard has not forgotten Uighurs by reading the late Abdurehim Ötkür’s poem when visiting Beijing in March 2019. I want to thank Harvardians like Joshua L. Freeman, who has courageously and genuinely written about his concern for Uighurs’ fate, which he knows well. I want to thank Ambassador Samantha J. Power, a Harvard Law School graduate, for speaking up for Uighurs. I want to thank the 70 Harvard student organizations that stood up for Ekpar Asat. And I want to thank the countless unsung heroes at Harvard who are championing Uighur freedom.
When I think of the voices that have come out from Harvard, I am proud and convinced that a motto of our country, “E Pluribus Unum,” was engraved in the Harvard spirit. That spirit urges people to act when there are injustices, even if they are in far-flung corners of the forgotten world — and this deserves my gratitude.

I’m a perfectionist, and I can’t do this anymore.
My heart is racing as I stay up past what should be my bedtime staring blankly at the screen, scared to make one wrong stroke on my keyboard out of fear of blemishing what must be a “perfect” piece of writing. I’m awake late, but I’m not tired. The determination and willpower that keeps perfectionists like me up doing a fourth round of edits on our English essays or committing the last chapter of a biology textbook to memory, into the morning’s early hours, makes the effects of caffeine and study drugs seem mild in comparison.
An unrelenting drive to be perfect all of the time, and in every task, is the unspoken but ever-present mental reality of many of our peers, myself included. In other words, perfectionism is our wonder drug, and the Harvard high we’re chasing is never not worth it.
Perfectionism, as commonplace and innocuous as it sounds, has taken over the interior lives of millions of students who have come to believe that simply achieving is not enough. For those of us at Harvard, perfectionism is often what gave us the edge that inflected our high school careers with the excellence that college admissions officers now demand.
In looking for the costs of a collective drive for perfection, I went searching for the kindred spirits of other Harvard perfectionists. Sophia N. Fend ’24 and Arjun N. Akwei ’24, two freshmen who self-identify as perfectionists, spoke with me about their experiences with perfectionism — and in doing so, showed me the commonalities that undergird the rigidities of this philosophy of perfection.
Fend did not always think of herself as a perfectionist. However, she used our collective quarantine experience to reflect on the experiences that paved her way to adulthood.
Fend describes her journey to Harvard through the lens of her perfectionism. In high school, where she leaned into perfectionism as a motivator to push herself to be her best, perfectionism made her detail-oriented and propelled her to go the extra mile on class assignments. Even though she now tries not to rely on her perfectionism to get work done, she acknowledges that it is an incredibly effective form of motivation, especially in an environment where student output is “gamified” in the form of GPAs: When the quality of a student’s work gets reduced to a number, it’s easy to focus on the percentage of points one missed, however small.
Yet, although perfectionism pushed her on a path that ultimately led to Harvard, Fend said she feels it is a “double-edged sword” that hurts even while it’s helping.
Akwei, who grew up in Chevy Chase, Md. as the son of two immigrants, a father from Ghana and a mother from Malaysia, talks about his perfectionism in a similar light, noting his family’s influence in shaping his work ethic. Perfectionism always prompts him to ask himself what we can do to make something better. Even when something is good, that’s no reason to stop.
But there is also a darker, more all-encompassing side to perfectionism that doesn’t get talked about nearly as often, and which finds its roots in the worst parts of our nation’s history.
I imagine it won't be hard for Harvard students to themselves in the stories of Akwei and Fend. Yet, as both explained, perfectionism does not just find itself in schoolwork, it is also heavily gendered and racialized. In Fend’s words, “creating yourself to be something that others want,” specifically men, is a style of thinking that has been pushed on women for centuries. For Akwei, being a person of color has meant that he has always had “something to prove” because being a person of color is to be socially imperfect in a nation where whiteness is the ideal.
As I have discovered throughout my life - when my fear of the imperfect has made outcomes that are only good seem intolerable - perfectionism becomes a form of self-harm because it is setting oneself up for failure. When good can always be better and perfect is the floor, not the ceiling, there is no room for self-satisfaction.
For me, perfectionism is not just something reflected on my transcript but has evolved itself into a pathological philosophy of viewing the world.
A life of doing everything “right” all the time leaves no room for error or for growth when growth and learning are everything to an education.
The omnipresent culture of competition that permeates nearly every aspect of life today has undoubtedly shaped the mental world that young people move through.
Yet perfectionism is so potent because perfection, on a societal level, is meant to feel attainable. If only we could improve our grades, get into our dream college, or look the way influencers look on Instagram, we could be a little bit closer to perfect. But we must introduce an expression of reality into the cold calculus of perfectionism because “perfect” is not a concept that exists in real life, nor is it ever meant to be attainable.
I may be a perfectionist, but I can’t do this anymore, because a life where good is never good enough and perfect is the floor and not the ceiling, is not a life I can or want to lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers and home improvement industry representatives discussed the recent remodeling boom and widening housing inequities — both linked to the Covid-19 pandemic — in an event hosted by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and the Kennedy School’s Taubman Center for State and Local Government on Thursday.
The event followed the release of the center’s latest housing report, which found that the home improvement industry has rebounded much more quickly than the U.S. economy in the aftermath of the pandemic. The report cited an increase in do-it-yourself home improvement projects as well as remodeling in affordable metro areas as chief factors for the industry’s positive outlook.
Abbe H. Will, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies who worked on the report, said during the event that home improvement projects were likely to drive over 3 percent growth for the national housing industry, totaling nearly $420 billion.
“The pandemic turned out to be something of a boon for the remodeling industry by forcing a variety of housing and lifestyle changes that encouraged improvement spending,” Will said. “In 2020, with so many owners working from home, kids learning from home, certainly with the health concerns about having contractors working inside the home, do-it-yourself projects really surged.”
Speakers at the event also warned of a widening gap in housing conditions between low-income and high-income households as a result of broader economic inequalities worsened by the pandemic.
Caroline E. Blakely, the president and CEO of Rebuilding Together, an affordable housing non-profit, said the industry growth generally was not felt in low-income neighborhoods, particularly those of color.
“We found that during the last year of the pandemic, low-income households and neighborhoods were disproportionately impacted by the economic downturn caused by Covid,” Blakely said. “We’ve seen very hard choices in the last year — prioritizing food over medicine over the leaking roof.”
Blakely said Covid-19 has only exacerbated previous trends in housing inequities. She cited a figure from the report that in 2019, about 2.7 million homeowners lived with moderate to severe plumbing or electrical deficiencies, pest infestations, or structural problems.
Such problems disproportionately afflict low-income households living in “older housing stock” who cannot afford to maintain their homes, she noted.
“They don’t have a choice, they don’t have that discretion, they don’t have extra dollars to spend,” Blakely said in an interview following the event.
“I want students to understand that there’s a great need out there — the housing stock is aging in this country and it is a big problem,” Blakely added.
According to the report, aging housing stock and increasing rates of severe climate-related natural disasters will create “strong” growth in the home improvement industry “for years to come.”
“It’s very funny for us to talk about growth in the industry being driven by increased natural disasters,” Will said in an interview following the event. “But it’s a fact of life that we’ve had an increase in the frequency of these large-scale disasters and the size and the strength of these disasters.”
Blakely said she hopes the pandemic will underscore the necessity of increasing access to home improvement services. She noted that several of the participants made donations to the non-profit she runs during her remarks.
“The silver lining in all of this is that people really now understand the meaning of a safe home, because everybody’s been having to live in one,” Blakely said. “I think more and more people are realizing that a helping hand up for these people is what they need.”

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday to reinstate its program providing students with free disposable hygiene products for the rest of the spring 2021 semester.
The act allocates $494.88 to create 144 feminine hygiene packs, which will contain 5 sets of heavy and regular flow tampons and pads for a total of 20 products in each pack.
If the 144 bags are used before the end of the semester, the legislation allows the UC to use up to $1484.64 from the Burst Pack, which is for discretionary spending purposes, to support the program further, the legislation reads.
“All deserve free and easy access to disposable hygiene products,” the legislation reads.
Students can retrieve the packs at the Harvard Yard Mail Center and one house mailing center, which is currently undecided.
The UC enacted Sunday’s legislation as a follow-up to a similar act passed in fall 2020, after the original program — launched by the UC in 2018 — encountered accessibility issues due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The pandemic prevented students from accessing the free hygiene products in bathrooms due to widespread facility closures across campus.
Following last semester’s period products program, the UC released a survey to get feedback. Nineteen students responded in total.
“100% of the respondents said they would like the program to continue in Spring 2021,” the new legislation reads.
Crimson Yard Representative Shreya P. Nair ’24, Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, and Adams House Representative Esther J. Xiang ’23 sponsored the legislation. The UC voted in favor of the act with a vote of 39-0-1.
The Council also passed legislation to publicize a survey to gauge student interest in zero-waste products.
The legislation hopes to make plastic-free products more accessible for first-generation, low-income students and reduce plastic waste among College students.
“U.S. college students throw away half a billion plastic toiletry containers every year,” the legislation reads. “A majority of this waste will end up at landfills or incinerators in low-income American communities.”
This legislation is part of a longer-term project that will try to gauge an understanding of how students use plastic products and will partner with a sustainable products company, such as Generation Conscious.
Sponsored by Ahuja, Xiang, and Dunster House Representative Juan C. Venancio ’23, the legislation passed with a vote of 32-2-2.

The Institute of Politics is accepting applications for a one-time “start-up stipend” offered to members of the Class of 2021 who are pursuing work in the political and public service sector in summer 2021.
The stipend amount will vary based on demonstrated financial need, with amounts ranging up to $5,000. Though financial need will be taken into account when applications are reviewed, all graduating seniors are eligible to apply, including those who do not receive financial assistance from the College.
IOP Vice President Kevin L. Ballen ’22 said the program is meant to help graduates pursue a career path that might not otherwise be accessible due to economic circumstances, especially during the pandemic.
“The basic premise is that it’s a really difficult time right now with Covid-19,” Ballen said. “Public service jobs tend to have shorter and varying timelines, sometimes you get an internship or need to live in a city where you’re going to work first.”
“Our goal is to help people sort of pursue these pathways,” he added.
According to Ballen, the stipend will alleviate some financial constraints imposed on graduating seniors to ensure greater accessibility to political and public service jobs.
“The goal is twofold: one is to make access to these jobs more accessible for students of all different types of backgrounds,” he said. “The second is to really help students in a particularly uncertain time and in uncertain fields of politics and public service where jobs move quickly or move at the last minute.”
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 wrote in an email that the IOP is “proud” to extend this stipend to graduating seniors dedicated to the “common good.”
“At this challenging moment in our economy and in our civic life, the Institute is proud to support graduating seniors whose work and dedication to the common good could not be more relevant or more critical than at this time,” Gearan wrote.
IOP Internships and Career Services Coordinator Sadie B. Polen wrote in an email that the new stipend program is “more important than ever.”
“It’s a unique program, created during a unique time, when public service is more important than ever,” Polen wrote. “We’re eager to see the impact our alumni will have as they begin their path in politics and public service.”
In fall 2020, the IOP also debuted a stipend program for current undergraduates pursuing term-time jobs in politics and public service.

In an interview with The Crimson Friday, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui acknowledged residents’ and city leaders’ “frustration” over the limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines, which has hampered city distribution efforts.
“Looking back on how things could be better or what should have been done to begin with, it would be to have more supply for the local health departments,” Siddiqui said.
The state initially capped Cambridge at just 100 vaccine doses per week, before increasing it to 400 in February.
Last week, the state entered the fourth stage of its “Phase Two” Covid-19 vaccination program, widening eligibility to individuals aged 60 and older along with some essential workers, including those in the sanitation, grocery, utility, and transit sectors.
As of Friday, the city had administered 4,497 doses of either the Moderna or the single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to eligible Cambridge residents, according to a city dashboard.
Siddiqui said the supply issues were hindering more grassroots efforts in the city’s vaccination campaign.
“I wish we were doing more of this in the community, right?” she said. “Why can’t we be going into the Rindge Towers in North Cambridge and going door to door? It’s all because of supply.”
The Rindge Towers are an affordable housing development where Siddiqui herself grew up.
Despite the hindrance caused by the state’s limited supply of doses, Siddiqui praised the work of the Cambridge Pandemic Collaborative — a city-led group charged with organizing pandemic response — in leading vaccination efforts.
The city will commence the last stage of “Phase Two” on April 5, which will expand vaccination eligibility to include individuals age 55 and older as well as those with one underlying medical condition.
Individuals age 16 and older in Massachusetts will be eligible to receive the vaccine after April 19 when “Phase Three” of the state’s vaccination effort begins.
Siddiqui also acknowledged other impediments to the vaccine distribution efforts. Specifically, she cited the challenges many Cambridge seniors faced when trying to navigate the appointment booking process.
“These are people in their 70s, people in their 80s, who the system has failed,” she said.
In recent weeks, the city also ramped up its homebound vaccination program, which is designed to vaccinate individuals who are bedbound, have cognitive or behavioral issues, or mobility issues. The Cambridge Public Health Department is leading the initiative in partnership with the Cambridge Housing Authority and Cambridge Council on Aging.
Siddiqui said she believes residents are satisfied with the program and the city’s system is working as it should.
“We’ve generally heard a lot of positive feedback on our firefighters and our teams who are involved as well as the Cambridge Pandemic Collaborative and their work that they’re doing,” Siddiqui said.
Siddiqui, who serves as the Chair of the Cambridge School Committee, also discussed the recent “COVID Conversations On Safety and Health Protocols” she has hosted with the Cambridge Public Health Department, during which parents can ask questions about Covid-19 protocols in schools. Some teachers and parents had criticized the school district for its handling of remote learning in the fall.
Cambridge Public Schools expanded in-person learning on March 1 and will do so again in April. Starting April 5, elementary schools will offer full-time in-person learning five days a week, with upper schools following suit on April 28.
“I think it’s good timing as more and more people are going back into the school,” she said. “Parents have concerns about distancing and what classrooms will look like and all these things.”

Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology administrators apologized for the “pain” the museum caused by its refusal to voluntarily return certain funerary objects to Native American tribes and pledged to reverse the policy in response to a letter from the Association on American Indian Affairs last month criticizing the museum.
In February, the Association sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow accusing Harvard of legal and moral violations in the Museum’s practices regarding its collections of Native American human remains and cultural objects. In the letter, the nonprofit said Harvard’s practices are in violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
Bacow initially responded to the Association’s chief executive, Shannon O’Loughlin, in early March, writing that he had asked Peabody Museum Director Jane Pickering to respond in detail to the Association’s letter.
In a five-page response Thursday, Pickering and Peabody Museum NAGPRA Advisory Committee Chair Philip J. Deloria denied that the Museum was in violation of the law, but apologized for past practices and announced changes to the Museum’s research and repatriation policies that match some of the Association’s demands.
In the response, Pickering and Deloria assured O’Loughlin of their “concrete commitment to the return of individuals to fulfill the ethical and moral imperative of NAGPRA.”
“We intend that the Native American individuals in the Peabody Museum will be transferred through repatriation or disposition,” they wrote.
“The museum has no interest in subverting or delaying NAGPRA’s implementation. Our Museum is not the proper place for these remains, and we are committed to their return.”
Passed by Congress in 1990, NAGPRA required any institutions that receive federal funding to compile inventories of Native American human remains and cultural objects they held in their collections in consultation with Native American tribes, and to repatriate them when they could determine a tribal affiliation. When institutions classify remains or objects as “culturally unidentifiable,” tribes can claim those items through a different process that sometimes requires them to submit evidence of affiliation. Under that process, the institution can also sometimes choose to repatriate only human remains, but not associated funerary objects.
The Association claimed in its initial letter that Harvard had “caused continuing physical, emotional and spiritual trauma to Native Nations and their citizens” by placing an undue burden on Native American tribes to provide evidence when requesting repatriation, and by refusing to voluntarily return some funeral objects in addition to remains.
Pickering and Deloria acknowledged that in the past, the Museum had refused to voluntarily repatriate some cultural objects along with human remains, as the AAIA’s letter had alleged, and announced that they had begun the process of repatriating those objects.
“The Peabody Museum apologizes for those refusals and the pain they caused,” they wrote. “The moral context of the return of a human being to a tribal nation means that those things placed in a burial—personal, spiritual, and ceremonial items—should be transferred along with the person or persons with whom they were buried.”
“We have changed our policy and are in the process of reaching out to tribes affected by the past policy and informing our present and future tribal partners of this change,” they added.
Responding to the AAIA’s claim that the Museum used did not take advantage of relevant geographic information that could have been used to determine the tribal affiliation of many of the remains the Peabody had labeled as “culturally unidentifiable,” Deloria and Pickering wrote that geography alone is often not enough to determine a tribal affiliation.
The AAIA’s letter had also protested that the Peabody had not publicized its policies for NAGPRA compliance. The Museum is currently designing a website, which it anticipates launching in the early summer, that will provide more public information on these policies, Deloria and Pickering wrote.
The Museum will also announce “formal policy changes in research protocols and permissions regarding human remains and associated funerary objects” in the upcoming months, they added. The AAIA had demanded that the Museum impose a moratorium on all research on its collections of Native American human remains and cultural objects, and that it remove a search tool from its website that displayed photos of Native American funerary objects.
Pickering and Deloria took a more defensive stance in responding to the Association’s claim that the Peabody violated NAGPRA by sometimes failing to properly consult with Native American tribal nations when completing inventories of their collections, leading it to misclassify some remains as “culturally unidentifiable.” The Museum administrators wrote that the Department of the Interior constrained the Museum’s inventory process through “shortened consultation timelines and regular quotas,” forcing it to classify some remains as culturally unidentifiable.
“The Museum did not then and does not now intend that those preliminary determinations be final,” they added. “Since 2001 the Museum has actively continued consultations.”
In an interview with The Crimson Saturday, O’Loughlin said she was pleased at the policy change around voluntary repatriation that Pickering and Deloria announced in their letter.
“The fact that they have now expressly changed their policy regarding the repatriation of funerary objects, and that they put that on the website, is extremely good news,” O’Loughlin said.
“I know that we do, with Phil Deloria and Jane Pickering, share the sentiment of NAGPRA,” she added. “Where we’re not connecting is the understanding of what the law provides and what the requirements are.”
Despite Pickering and Deloria’s claim that evidence beyond geographical affiliation is needed to affiliate some remains and objects to a single tribe, O’Loughlin said this “has not impeded other institutions from making determinations of affiliation to multiple tribes.”
“If you’re not willing to repatriate then you make these kinds of excuses, that it’s too hard or complicated,” she said.
While O’Loughlin said she is “grateful that they’re working on it,” she hopes to see further changes in the Museum’s practices.
“Writing a policy or just having ongoing consultations with tribes or discussions or meetings, does not equal compliance,” she added. “Compliance is all of that — and repatriation, so we actually just have to keep the pressure on and see how this translates into actual actions.”

Tara Bassi, a first-year student at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, has only experienced Harvard from her desk in Delhi, India. Barred from Harvard’s gates due to the global pandemic, Bassi has had to navigate experiences she would have had in person on Zoom — often with mixed results.
“My internet is not stable. Sometimes my power goes out, and I’m sitting in the dark,” she said. “There’s not much consistency across the board in terms of what resources we have, where we are, what we can do.”
Since the onset of Covid-19, graduate students like Bassi have not merely been tasked with adapting their learning and scholarship to a digital platform. The dearth of in-person interactions that has persisted as Harvard enters its 13th month of online school has forced them to reconsider what academic, social, and emotional work entails.
Marisa J. Borreggine, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Earth and Planetary Sciences, said the proliferation of activities that take place online has muddled boundaries that once gave her life structure.
Borreggine said interactions that took place seamlessly before the pandemic — including soliciting help from colleagues — now feel contrived and burdensome virtually.
“I have to shoot them an email, and wait, or send them a message on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger or Slack, which is blurring the lines even more between what is work, and what isn’t work,” she said.
Prior data lays foundational evidence for the toll the pandemic has taken on graduate students’ lives. Open from May to September of 2020, a survey organized by the Harvard Graduate Council identified obstacles to graduate students’ wellbeing.
Of the survey’s 1,952 respondents across Harvard’s 12 graduate schools, roughly 1,050 cited “emotional and mental wellbeing” as a barrier to online learning. Approximately 390 cited time zone differences as a hinderance and roughly 200 said they were impeded by a lack of stable Wi-Fi.
Unlike undergraduates, who enjoy structure from a host of college resources and activities, Bassi said graduate students’ lives are less coordinated, which has made them feel further disconnected from their peers during Covid-19.
“In college, I feel like everybody is having a similar experience. Over here, it’s everything you can possibly imagine,” she said.
Mark York, a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, described missing understated in-person interactions — such as spontaneous conversation with colleagues over lunch.
“Pre-Covid-times, I would ask someone in my lab, ‘Hey, let’s go to the cafeteria together at the Harvard Law School and grab lunch.’ And then he or she would tell me about their research, and we’d share ideas — that’s completely gone,” he said.
For students whose fields require hands-on learning, the shift to online learning has been particularly pronounced. In replacement of hands-on models, Bassi and other Design School students are utilizing the 3D-modeling software Rhino to construct virtual models.
“I have to imagine a 3D scenario in a 2D space,” she said. “I can’t see it, I can’t touch it, I can’t physically cut it or open it up. I have to think about all those things in this flat screen. It’s quite difficult to understand those spaces and design something three-dimensional two-dimensionally.”
While students could conveniently rely on support from colleagues when they were all learning together on campus, Borreggine, who studies the role of sea level change in ancient and historical human migration events, said reaching out for help online is burdensome.
“I plopped my laptop down on the desk next to someone and they helped me debug something. Now, I’m screen-sharing,” she said. “And it’s hard to read — it just makes everything so much more complicated.”
Just finding the motivation to soldier through online classes is also difficult, said Rutvij Merchant, a student in the Master’s in Public Health program at the Harvard School of Public Health. Merchant, who is from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, said it is easy to “not be 100 percent there” during virtual classes.
“It really places the onus on you to be very self-motivated,” he said. “When you’re in person, there’s a lot of external factors that are helping you stay in the moment, and engage with material.”
Merchant said experiencing three months of Harvard in person before the pandemic struck — a period he described as “fantastic” — has accentuated the shortcomings of online education.
“I saw what in-person learning looked like, and what being part of that thriving learning community at a particular school could resemble,” he said. “It’s very easy to flip into thinking of what could be and what is, and then thinking about the difference between the two.”
“You become very anxious, because you’re like, ‘I’m here for a short period of time, and is this just what we’re going to have?’” he added.
York said Covid-19 touches “every single aspect” of the graduate student experience.
While Cambridge’s once-happening “house party scene” brought graduate students from different programs together, students are now more “siloed” and interact mostly with people within their departments.
“Even if it were something like a Game of Thrones watch party, that’s where you met people from MIT, met people from different schools — those peripheral connections that bring new ideas and introduce you to people you wouldn’t have otherwise met,” he said. “I found they’re pretty much gone.”
In addition to large gatherings, the pandemic has erased some mundane social interactions from graduate students’ lives. Jason E. Anesini, a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Chemistry department, said the coronavirus crisis has reduced his position as a non-resident tutor in Dunster House — in which he serves as an academic adviser to undergraduates — to a “perfunctory” role.
“I haven’t been able to eat in the dining halls or network with people — I don’t really think people know I exist,” he said. “There’s a physical disconnect that’s hard to bridge over Zoom.”
Starting graduate school virtually was a particularly isolating experience for Karis E. Will, another Ph.D candidate in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology department.
“The sheer isolation of starting anew without being afforded the ability to go out into your environment and meet people, have a community — that was hard,” she said.
“For me, an important thing is finding a chosen queer community,” Will added. “Not being able to do that has been pretty harsh.”
Though graduate students reported feeling academically constrained and socially isolated over the past year, some pointed to the convenience of Zoom and activities away from their computer as positives amid the pandemic.
Despite its challenges, Graduate School of Education student Said Bilani credits the focus on digital learning for encouraging him to approach his coursework and extracurricular endeavors in innovative ways.
“Moving forward, I can’t imagine going back to a traditional environment,” he said.
Bilani, who leads nonprofit initiatives domestically and in the Middle East, said the normalization of video calls through Zoom has made it easier to deepen relationships.
“It’s shown me the rich power of partnerships — for example, I’m able to develop public-private partnerships in Lebanon, by as little as a Zoom call,” he said.
For Peter Choi, a first-year student in the Master’s of Bioethics program at Harvard Medical School, Zoom has enabled him to maximize his efficiency.
“I can book things back-to-back-to-back about five minutes apart, and attend everything in the comfort of my own home,” he said. “My schedule has been more packed, if anything. And that will definitely change once I actually have to start being mobile and move from location to location.”
Choi, who also serves as a volunteer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, also said the in-person experience of seeing “fresh faces” has improved his wellbeing over the past year, which has been isolating for many people.
“I have this benefit of volunteering, which is a very physical activity,” he said. “I do meet people there, too, who are fellow volunteers and paid staff members who are helping out during the Covid pandemic.”
Anesini, too, said his ability to work in person at a lab helped him establish a sustainable work-life balance.
“It’s really nice to be able to have a separate space where I work. And then when I leave that, I can think about my personal life,” he said. “I think for a lot of graduate students, it’s difficult because they don’t have the ability to do that.”
Over the past year, Borreggine said she has found solace in organizing for Harvard’s graduate student union. Borreggine, who currently serves as the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s vice president, called her activity in the union a “healing and restorative process.”

When you’re sitting on a three-hour-long Zoom, there’s nothing better than pulling out your phone to dive into the never-ending TikTok rabbit hole. While trends may come and go (anyone remember Dalgona coffee?), this “Nature’s Cereal” has taken TikTok by storm, endorsed by Lizzo herself — so of course, I had to try it and tell you whether it deserves to be a trend or in the trash.
What is it?
The surprisingly simple recipe consisted of coconut water, fresh berries, and ice. Considering this is exactly what you put in a smoothie (just unblended), I was skeptical from the beginning. I used VitaCoco water, strawberries, and blackberries in my “Nature’s Cereal.”
How it went
While tasty — I mean, it’s berries and coconut water — I think this dish ranks just behind “my.harvard during Shopping Week” but before “Wellness Days” in terms of uselessness. The coconut water did make things a little interesting, but it tasted exactly as I expected: good, refreshing, but nothing special. It’s literally fruit.
The bar was so low that it was underground, at approximately the depth of the inbound level of the Harvard T station. The flavors barely exceeded my expectations. They would have been at the outbound level of the Harvard T station: better, but still underground.
If you actually loved Nature’s Cereal (really???), here are some other subpar similar ways to enjoy your favorite dishes. (disclaimer: don’t actually try these at home)
Nature’s Soup
Love tomato soup? Cut up some tomatoes, throw them into a bowl of cold water, and munch away. Don’t even bother heating it up unless it’s over an open flame — there are no stoves in the wilderness.
Nature’s Tea
Heat water in a kettle, and once it starts screaming like your brain in Lamont at 3 a.m., pour that boiling hot water straight into your mouth and munch on a teabag from Berg. A tea fit for the queen.
Nature’s Birthday Cake
Celebrate the spring break we never had! If you can’t harvest your own wheat to make your own Nature’s flour, just pour some regular flour down your throat and wash it down with some chunks of butter, egg, and sugar. Still less awful than missing out on spring break.
Nature’s Steak
Round up the blockmates for a good old-fashioned paleolithic hunting trip! Chase your prey with crudely fashioned flint knives and spears, before chowing down on your meal like the wolves from Planet Earth. It’ll be the River Run of your dreams.
Overall, I’d give Nature’s Cereal 2/5 stars, only because I’m angry about the level of hype this has gotten. Just have a smoothie instead. Or literally anything else.

Love It: It’s Houseparty, Just With Learning as an Activity Option – Nicole T. Rozelman
Let’s face it, the only reason you used to roll out of bed and hustle to your 9 a.m. in the Geology Museum was to see the friend you’re taking the class with. Now that we’re all visiting students at Zoom University, large lectures are no longer a space for catching up. When the professor asks who did the reading, there’s no way for you to make eye contact with that one other person four screens over who also never even bought the book. Breakout rooms bring back that element of intimacy, if just for a few minutes of your day. Forget the discussion questions, exercise those networking muscles while exchanging conspiracy theories for what next semester will look like. Or stick with the classic “How are things where you are?” and be transported to your classmate’s quarantine hideout in Hawaii as they describe how they’ve been keeping busy with daily walks by the water.
Breakout rooms also bring much-needed excitement into our lives. Move over Datamatch, Zoom’s algorithm is the latest development connecting the “last row lecture-goers” and section kids who never would have crossed paths. At the very least, the knowledge that you’ll be face-to-face with someone can serve as motivation to look cute for your Snap streaks, all from the comfort of your sweatpants. Or if “Love Is Blind” is more your speed, leave your camera off and build that chemistry before you agree to form a study group of two.
Last but certainly not least, some of us are actually still trying to learn. With user-friendly features like the “Ask for Help” button, you can call your instructor or CA over to ask a question without the attention of the entire class and get some extra one-on-one explanation. This individualized attention is just another way we can try to make the most of the full tuition we’re paying.
Hate It: I Want to Choose My Friends, Just Let Me Go to Class in Peace – Georgia K. Steigerwald
Small group discussions are great…when you get to hang out with your friends to break up the monotony of a long lecture class. But online? With people you don’t choose? No thank you.
If the only thing getting you through your statistics class before eviction was the knowledge that your pset buddies were struggling as much as you were, then being forced into a randomized break-out room without the comfort of your friends is even more intimidating. Not to mention the awkwardness of trying to make small talk with random strangers. There are only so many cutesy one-liners about quarantine you can use, and it’s getting old real fast. And if the other members of your breakout room aren’t talking, then they’re watching you have a conversation with yourself, and no one needs to see that.
Maybe some people are missing human interaction to “spice things up,” but there are plenty of other platforms in which you can willingly choose to speak to other people. Sometimes you just want to watch a lecture in pajamas while eating a big bowl of Froot Loops in peace, but now you’re being told you need to turn your camera on and interact with other humans instead of your dog. What’s the point of online learning if you can’t exist in sweats and avoid human contact all day every day?
On the academic side, the forced participation is unacceptable. In a large online lecture you can rest assured that you won’t be cold-called and forced to admit that you have absolutely no idea what’s going on because this online thing is reallllly not working for you. But in a breakout room, your TF might call on you at any time, embarrassing you in front of strangers as you timidly reply that you need more help. You were just planning on watching the professor go over the problem so you could have some anonymous help. Breakout rooms are an intrusion into the online learning experience and are more annoying than they are helpful.
