After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his third annual State of the Judiciary, Chief Justice Ralph D. Gants of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court called upon the state legislature to authorize departures from mandatory minimums for drug offenses with mitigating circumstances like non-violence and disability. This statement was driven by the concern that drug convictions have a disproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities, with current mandatory minimums amplifying that negative impact.
This request comes after an attempt of a trial judge to give Imran Laltaprasad, who was convicted of possession and intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, a sentence lower than the mandatory minimum due to the small amount of contraband and an extreme medical condition. But the case was remanded by the Supreme Judicial Court as it violated current legislative discretion, and Laltaprasad was re-sentenced with mandatory minimums. In the aftermath, however, Gants has worked to pressure the legislature to reconsider these rules.
We applaud Gants for his work in racial equity and for pressing to ensure that sentences for drug offenses do not perpetuate inequality. Currently, Massachusetts imprisons African-Americans eight times more often and Hispanics 4.9 times more often than white defendants. This discrepancy is worse than the national average and deserves attention. For high mandatory minimums not only fail to fulfill productive goals of rehabilitation and reintegration, they also are very costly in terms of tax money and human capital. When the dimension of race is added in, systematic racial inequality is also further perpetuated.
While opponents have argued that granting discretion for mandatory minimums is too lenient and removes a barrier that might prevent offenders from committing the crime in the first place, drug offenses, especially non-violent ones, deserve special attention. If an offender is non-serious and also impacted by disability, as Laltaprasad was, there is ample reason to curtail the mandatory minimum sentences that only ensure the offender will be jailed away for an inordinate period of time at a high cost to taxpayers. Extended periods of imprisonment will also hurt chances of reintegration, causing further damage to society. It is important to realize that sufferers of addiction need rehabilitation more than punishment.
We are further supportive of Gants for commissioning Harvard Law School to explore reasons for current racial disparities. The purpose of this report is to inform the creation of sentencing guidelines that would both deter crimes and protect the public while also assuring sentences are racially and situationally equitable. Efforts to reform mandatory minimums have been stagnant in Massachusetts for years, while several other states, including traditionally conservative ones, have already reconfigured mandatory sentences or abandoned them entirely in favor of treatment programs.
We hope that the state legislature will take both the resulting report and Gants’ call for reformation seriously. Non-violent drug defenses are better answered by treatment and reintegration rather than immoral and inflexible punishment. By giving judges more discretion over mandatory minimums, Massachusetts will be able to move towards both greater racial equality and more enlightened administration of justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To simultaneously acknowledge the mistakes of the past and contribute to a wiser future is not an easy job. Work of this sort requires humility and self-awareness. We believe, however, that these are qualities expected of any informed citizen, and therefore of students of Harvard University. It is to our dismay, then, that the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players have failed to do both in preparing this year’s rendition of "The Mikado."
Conceived in 1884, "The Mikado" uses a Japanese town to lambast British political culture. Infantilized character names like Yum-Yum and Pooh-Bah set an uncomfortable foundation for the play. Historical productions turn the uncomfortable into the outright grotesque. A 1984 production in Ontario abounded with buck-toothed caricatures. In 2014, a performance in Seattle ignited national outrage with its excessively powdered and made-up representations of the main characters.
The Harvard Gilbert and Sullivan Players have contributed to this tradition every four years. In 1996 they took appropriation of Japanese culture to its logical conclusion with advertising materials featuring anime girls, while in 2012 their performance was replete with Fu Manchu moustaches and geisha make-up. This year, the Players add another entry to this line of productions.
Beneath the powder and eyeliner lies a centuries-old history of erasure. The desire to exclude Asian Americans is not confined to Chinese immigration laws or Executive Order 9066. All of the aforementioned infractions can be broadly lumped under the umbrella of yellowface, the practice of placing white actors in roles formed from reductive interpretations of East Asian culture and character, a foul concept that goes beyond make-up and costuming. Yellowface covers up failures to offer opportunities of consequence to Asian American artists.  Long ago, audiences applauded the all-white cast of "The Mikado" for their humorous exoticism; today the Harvard Players have two Asian American actors sprinkled into a white-dominated cast. But the story has not changed: understandings of diversity within the world of performance are limited to cursory gestures, assuaging only the shallowest of racial sensitivities.
Effective representations of diversity are impossible in institutions where stories are written and offered through white perspectives only. Changes that the Players have made to the script this year ultimately consist of attempts to cover up old prejudices with new ones, and therefore do nothing to separate the play from yellowface. They use kasutori culture as an inspiration for the decadent atmosphere of their revision, without acknowledging that kasutori comes from the despair resulting from the atomic bombings of WWII and subsequent American occupation of Japan. Placing kasutori in the United States is a bastardization of that culture, and exhibits disrespect for the trauma of WWII on the Japanese people. Furthermore, in switching the setting from 1880s Japan to 1960s America they have ignored Japanese American internment the same way the original script ignored imperialist intrusions on Japanese soil. They retain the appropriative song “Mi-ya Sa-ma” in the repertoire despite their claims of de-racialization, exemplifying the original play’s disparagement of the Japanese language.
Let us deconstruct their use of yellowface further. The characters in the new version of the play are not ethnically Japanese and are only employees in a Japanese-themed Las Vegas hotel. Though this is not traditional yellowface because the characters are not Japanese, this meta-structure is a distraction from the fact that the employees in this Japanese-themed hotel are themselves yellowfaced in their jobs. The plot has the lower-class employees speaking out against the tyranny of their employer. While this is an interesting, socioeconomically relevant adaptation, it still does not satisfactorily engage racial issues, especially for a play with such a troubled history. This is an embellishment of yellowface, reflective of the euphemized racism of the modern day. The characters still channel shallow, diminutive, and exoticized interpretations of Japanese people. Yellowface is not just a concoction of yellow make-up and kimonos; it is a manifestation of a social force. The racism in the play has been merely updated for a more sensitive 21st century audience.
Erasures of identity fall forcefully upon every marginalized body. It is painful to disparage the work of Asian American students in the production crew in this way, but we cannot ignore that their adaptation is still riddled with the prejudice that has psychologically crippled communities of color. "The Mikado" reminds us that our own faces cannot be peeled off like masks.
We oppose, more than the problems specific to this staging of "The Mikado," the cultural forces that necessitate it, including a need to please alumni and preserve traditional structures at this college. We blame not only the Players for lacking awareness of the harm still very much present in their production, but also a society that fails to educate its citizens on the importance of such an awareness. We call for the Players to consult Asian American justice and social groups on campus in a serious manner in future productions and for the theater community as a whole to cast more Asian American actors. One could be tempted to blame Asian Americans for not being interested in theater. However, the stereotype of the inartistic Asian is not an excuse to ignore nearly a quarter of Harvard’s student body. It is an excuse that our community hears time and time again from Hollywood’s continual placement of white actors in Asian roles and from this nation’s publishing houses when they deny Asian American narratives. It is a consequence of a society that pushes Asian Americans away from art, and as students at Harvard we should seek to oppose this stereotype instead of propagating it.
This Friday, at 7:30 p.m. on the opening night of the play, members of the community will be demonstrating outside the Agassiz Theater. Before the Players’ patrons enter to watch white actors pantomime Asian characters, we will ensure they see the mask in the curtain. Until our artistic culture changes from one of erasure, suppression, and tokenism to a space where complex identities, racial politics, and cultural histories both problematic and uplifting can be explored and engaged freely, we will not keep our peace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2015, the New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players cancelled their production of “The Mikado,” a satire of British bureaucracy set in a fictional Japanese town of Titipu, after the production’s promotional postcards—featuring an almost entirely white cast dressed in kimonos and sporting kabuki makeup—caused a public outcry. Clearly, their appeal to “historical accuracy” did not justify their blatant yellowface. Yet “The Mikado; or, The Town of Titipu” is one of the most beloved works in the Gilbert and Sullivan canon and has an enormous cultural legacy. The board of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players, whose mission is to produce the full canon of Gilbert and Sullivan’s shows, faced a dilemma this past January: Strike “The Mikado” from our season, and ignore one of the most problematic but well-known G&S shows, or try to confront it by reimagining it and subverting authorial intent.
We decided on the latter option, choosing not to categorically ignore the problematic existence and history of the show, but to use that history and the Asian American scholarship on “The Mikado” to critically engage with the text and stage an intervention informed by academic sources and by the lived experiences of Asian American cast and crew members, including myself.
Such twistings and reimagining of classical works are fairly common; think modern productions of Shakespeare’s “Merchant of Venice,” for example. Our reframing of “The Mikado” has been particularly inspired by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ play, “An Octoroon,” which has been praised for its examination and deconstruction of portrayals of race in the 1859 play “The Octoroon.”
In researching the racial history of “The Mikado,” I found a wealth of information in Josephine Lee’s book “The Japan of Pure Invention,” which notes that the show was written during mid-19th century Western fascination with Japanese cultural objects. It perpetrated what postcolonial scholar Anne McClintock termed “commodity racism,” replacing Japanese people with Japanese objects, decreasing responsibility for cultural authenticity, and constructing a racial fantasy to stand in for the real Japan.
The show evolved new shades of nuance with major geopolitical changes in the era of “yellow peril” as Japan became a world power. Its commodity racism took on political significance in the context of “coolie” labor in the US, which Lee suggests accounts for a shift in interest to Japanese culture from once-popular Chinese culture after China diminished in global status (though the two cultures are often confused in “The Mikado”).
Nevertheless, the history of “The Mikado” is not merely a binary tale of oriental and occidental. In the United States, the racial dynamics of productions were further complicated by the intersection of yellowface and blackface. Yellowface for black actors provided the dubious freedom to play roles that, while stereotypes themselves, diverged from the stereotypes black actors were ordinarily forced to embody.
I hope that our production begins to address the show’s history and offers a focal point for discourse on problems of Asian American representation. While contributing to this conversation can include the creation of an entirely separate space in order to tell one’s story, as an Asian American at this historically (and currently) predominantly white institution, I have found that it can often be more difficult to take back agency and ownership in spaces that have not traditionally belonged to people who look like me. Although both methods are equally important, I, and other production staff, have chosen to work within our framework as a Gilbert and Sullivan society.
Our version of “The Mikado” transforms Titipu, into a 1960s Las Vegas themed Oriental hotel. The owner of the hotel is a Mafia don swept up in the American postwar fascination with Japanese culture. The racial fantasy central to Gilbert’s original “Mikado” is imposed violently on the don’s staff—western characters who perform elements of “Japanese-ness” (e.g. singing “Mi-ya Sa-ma,” an imperial Japanese military song appropriated by Gilbert and Sullivan) in his presence. Thus, we have taken the show’s original concept—western actors playing Japanese—and reified it in the staff members of the Hotel Mikado, in an effort to expose and critique the commodity racism and racial impersonation in Gilbert’s original “Mikado.”
In addition to the conceptual changes, I have worked in dramaturgical changes for the text, with advice from Professor Josephine Lee and Sean Graney, who recently directed an acclaimed version of “The Mikado” at the Oberon. We have rewritten the “Gentlemen of Japan” opening number as “Gentlemen of the Strip,” but retained the text to “Mi-Ya Sa-Ma,” one of the only authentically Japanese elements of the show, and restaged this moment to highlight the violence of racial impersonation. As with all HRG&SP shows, the roles were cast without specific races in mind for individual roles, though we attempted to keep diversity in mind.
Unsurprisingly, the discourse surrounding race (and its representation), culture (and its appropriation), and theater is incredibly complex. Even with our changes, the show remains problematic, and we invite all to engage with its history and contemporary implications during our various events. We hope that both Gilbert & Sullivan fans and outspoken critics of “The Mikado” will find our version to be an interesting and thoughtful contribution to a larger discussion, as well as an exemplar of the comic spirit of the canon.
Just four years ago, HRG&SP put on a production of “The Mikado” with a production aesthetic almost identical to that of NYG&SP. Though it was before my time at Harvard, I cringe when I scroll through the production photos, knowing that, at the time, hardly anyone gave the yellowface a second thought. But these photos also serve as a reminder of my own experience as an Asian American that I wish to confront, not to ignore. Just last month, a stranger shouted “ching ching pong” at me as I walked into Widener. I was too stunned to respond. Now, I feel ready to respond, and I am excited to share the work of our cast, staff, and orchestra with the wider community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The following remarks were delivered at Morning Prayers on Monday, October 24, before the news that Harvard and Local 26 had reached a tentative agreement:
For three weeks now, Harvard’s dining services workers have been engaged in a historic strike, the first of its kind since 1983. At stake in this battle are two very reasonable demands: livable annual wages and affordable health care. Given Harvard’s expansive endowment and celebrated capital campaign, the workers aren’t the greedy ones here.
As a longtime resident of Quincy House, I benefit immeasurably from the labor, talent, and friendship of my brothers and sisters in the dining hall. From the beginning of this strike, I have tried to do my part to ensure they get the fair contract they deserve, and to stand in solidarity with them until that happens.
When I was a graduate student at Columbia in the 1990s, the campus community had to figure out where we stood during multiple labor strikes. For my part, I taught off campus—in a church basement, an elementary school classroom, the backroom of a bar. Three weeks ago, I asked my students: Have you ever had to decide whether or not to cross a picket line? Most of them had no idea how to answer this question because they’ve never had to consider it. All that changed on October 5.
I learned not to cross a picket line long ago, not from some Ivy League professor, but from my parents and grandparents, all of whom had to strike at some point to demand their dignity as working people. The only reason I can now pay this lesson forward to my Ivy League students is because my folks walked the picket line. I have the privilege to teach because they had the courage to strike. That is why I moved my seminar from the Quincy dining hall when the strike started. I won’t teach about slavery and freedom in a classroom that requires me to cross a picket line to do so.
This is a difficult and defining time to teach at Harvard. Last Sunday, I learned about plans for a student walkout at 12:30 p.m. on Monday, in the middle of my American Protest Literature lecture. As a vocal supporter of the strike and workers, my position was clear, and I knew my longtime teaching colleague felt the same way, even though he expresses himself differently than I do, dating back to earlier campus battles over the Living Wage and Iraq War. We came up with a plan: We would talk about the history of labor strikes—after all, we were lecturing on Upton Sinclair and socialism last week—and then walk out with our students at 12:30.
Honestly, I had gone to bed uneasy, clear as I am about my position on the strike. My uneasiness—not unlike the uneasiness many faculty feel in this moment—stemmed from the fact that I have two values in tension right now: a responsibility to support the striking workers on the picket lines, and a responsibility to teach the students in my classrooms, many of whom support the strike, but some of whom don't or haven't yet decided where they stand.
I woke up thinking: It's easy for me to teach to the converted. But I also have an obligation—and a desire—to teach those whose views differ from my own. Isn't that the point of what we do? As I said to my students last Monday: This is a teachable and learnable moment for all of us, no matter where we line up right now.
So we revised our plan: I would start class by explaining our thinking and providing some context that helps students link what's going on in this strike with what we are studying in the course; I would then walk out with students who have decided to do so; and then my colleague would stay in class and continue to lecture about the history of labor protest as a way to set up our next lecture on Sinclair's "The Jungle." This is one advantage to team teaching: We can play different roles in a moment like this. Before I left class, I told them we want to give them an academic and a moral education, that these things are not mutually exclusive, and that our approach is meant to inform their decisions, not just now but in the future as well. I also assured them that there will be no expectation, judgment, or recrimination in our classroom. This was the kind of education I got at Harvard, when AIDS and apartheid were the issues of the day.
At 12:30, I walked out of class, only the second time I’ve done so in my teaching career; the other was the day before the Iraq War began. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't deeply moved when the vast majority of our students walked out, too. We joined the rally at the John Harvard statue, where I read the faculty petition in support of striking HUDS workers. We heard from students and workers who were fiercely eloquent in the way they expressed what's at stake for them in this strike. One of my favorite moments was when I realized the largest student contingents at the rally were from Protest Lit and Ec 10. You know it's a historic day at Harvard when students from such different classes stand in solidarity during a historic labor strike.
As exhilarating as all this can be, I still wonder and worry about the students who didn't walk out and never will, the students who don't and won’t agree with those of us who support the strike, and—perhaps most of all—the students who walked out because they felt coerced in some way into doing so. This is indeed a difficult and defining moment. There are no easy questions, or answers.
My prayer this morning is twofold: First, that our HUDS brothers and sisters can soon return from the picket lines to the dining halls with a fair contract; and second, that in the meantime we afford one another a fair hearing so that we can continue to teach and learn during these contentious times. Only then will we be able to resist the temptation to luxuriate in our own freedoms while others struggle to earn theirs. And only then will “Fair Harvard” be able to rightfully claim its commitment to Veritas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights recently selected 13 students to participate in the inaugural Human Rights Studies Working Group, which will expose students to resources at Harvard and beyond that focus on human rights work, according to EMR administrative director Tessa L. Desmond.
Of the 13 students, 10 are undergraduates and three are graduate students. While Desmond said she is often approached by freshmen who are interested in human rights studies, few of the University’s scholars in the field teach at the College.
“I’m a social studies concentrator and my focus field is on human rights in Latin America, and I think that there’s very few classes that actually cover human rights,” working group member Giovanna D. Robledo ’17 said.
According to Desmond, the group's main objectives are providing networking opportunities for members, helping members identify next steps for human rights training, and planning a public event in the spring. For example, the group will participate in workshops on finding and applying to human rights internships.
Law student and working group member Michael Jung said he hopes to use his experience at the Law School to help undergraduate members of the group in their human rights studies pursuits and to interact with a broad range of Harvard affiliates.
“I wanted to meet groups of students and faculty members from all around Harvard that were interested in human rights,” he said.
In its desire to provide students with human rights-related opportunities, the working group bears some similarity to the former Committee on Human Rights Studies, which was disbanded in 2010. The Committee’s dissolution led to the Ethnic Studies program’s absorption of Human Rights Studies, creating EMR. However,  Desmond said the new working group is different from the old committee, which was run through the Provost’s office.
Since the committee’s termination, Desmond said she’s noticed a decline in student organizations focused on human rights as a broad topic, rather than specific human rights abuses. She hopes the working group will be useful in reinvigorating the extracurricular human rights landscape.
“During that time, the understanding among undergraduates about human rights studies was really rich,” she said, referring to the period when the committee was still active.
Unlike the EMR-sponsored working groups on Asian American Studies and Latino Studies, acceptance to the Human Rights Studies Working Group is application-based and requires a steady commitment from members. While Desmond said she was originally planning to accept a group of six to 10 students, she decided to admit all 13 applicants to the group.
The working group’s first event was a lecture on Monday by University of California, Berkeley associate professor Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann, and future events will include trips to Harvard’s various human rights centers, such as the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School, Desmond said.
“I think what really drew me was the opportunity to talk to undergraduates, graduates, and especially professors who have [human rights] as their specialty,” Robledo said.

Students now have more options in Harvard Square to spend their recently acquired $75 of Crimson Cash with the addition of new eateries to the program.
Harvard University Dining Services wrote in an email to students on Oct. 15 that the University would add $25 to students’ Crimson Cash accounts in order to introduce more “flexibility” in student dining options during the dining hall workers’ strike. A week later, HUDS announced they would add another $50 to students’ Crimson Cash accounts.
Crimson Cash is a payment account to which students can add value and use to make purchases at both on and off-campus establishments.
The program has added pizzeria Oggi Gourmet and burger chain b.good to the online list of now 18 establishments that accept Crimson Cash. Oggi Gourmet cook Herson Juardo said that although the pizzeria had ended their participation in the program after moving to 30 Dunster St. in February, student interest led them to rejoin.
“We began accepting it starting this weekend,” Juardo said. “A lot of our customers were asking if we were accepting Crimson Cash in the last few weeks, so we decided to start using it again.”
B.good, which reopened earlier this month in Harvard Square, previously accepted Crimson Cash at their Smith Campus Center location, according to Director of Marketing Aubree Giarrosso. The eatery closed in March due to renovations to the Smith Campus Center slated to last until 2018.
“We just started accepting Crimson Cash again at our new location yesterday,” Giarrosso said on Tuesday. “We used to allow it at our old location and after popular demand from our customers, brought it back to our new location.”
Some merchants said they had seen increased Crimson Cash usage at their restaurants and stores during the strike. The strike began in early October and appears near its end after Harvard and dining workers reached a "tentative agreement" Tuesday.
Broadway Marketplace has seen an increased number of students using Crimson Cash, according to store manager George Hickey.
“Crimson Cash actually sent out a small flyer to all of their retailers to let us know that the students were going to get an increase on their cards,” Hickey said. “I responded and asked them for an additional stand-alone card-reading machine so that I could actually have two in the store and within five days I received it.”

John Hochberger, the general manager of restaurant Wagamama, said he estimates there has been about three times as much Crimson Cash used since students received additional funds.
“Before we wouldn’t see too much come through but now it is a regular form of payment,” Hochberger said. “It’s definitely positive for our company; for the students, they seem like they’re really enjoying it when they’re coming in. I know they’re having issues with their dining halls which is unfortunate, but we’re glad to sort of help them in any way that we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Union members bargained throughout the night Monday before finally coming to an agreement around 1 a.m Tuesday. After negotiations wrapped up, Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union representing Harvard’s dining workers—said the agreement “accomplished all of our goals.” Full details of the contract will be released before the vote, according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.
But the strike, now more than 20 days long, is technically ongoing.
Though the accord marks the closest the two parties have come to an agreement in nearly five months, HUDS employees must ratify the contract before they can officially return to work in dining halls and cafes across campus.
Harvard Executive Vice President Katie Lapp wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday that the agreement will be a five-year contract, if ratified. The union will announce the results of the vote around 5 p.m. Wednesday, according to a press release.
While picketing HUDS workers and student supporters alike await the vote’s outcome, some undergraduates said the atmosphere on campus felt subdued—picket lines abuzz with protesters for nearly three weeks were deserted, and Harvard Yard, once filled with chants of “No justice, no peace!” was silent. According to Ten Eyck, picketing was officially suspended throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, though a few workers reported briefly to their stations early Tuesday morning.
“It definitely feels a little strange because it’s kind of like this weird lull in the moment,” Jose D. Perez ’18 said as he crossed Harvard Yard Tuesday afternoon. “I’m curious to see how it feels afterwards, if there’s any tensions left over, so that should be interesting to watch.”
According to an email sent to Pforzheimer House residents by the House’s Faculty Deans Tuesday evening, HUDS workers will likely return to the dining halls Thursday and spend a day restocking the facilities before normal operations resume next Monday.
Sabrina Wu ’20 said she also found campus unexpectedly quiet, noting “there doesn’t seem to be a lot of talk” about the strike ending. She said she thought students would be glad when HUDS workers return to the dining halls, though many currently appear indifferent.
“Perhaps that is why the atmosphere on campus appears less celebratory than on social media,” she wrote in an email.
Both Perez and Wu said they were personally glad to hear HUDS employees would likely be returning to work.
Members of the Student Labor Action Movement, the student activist group that orchestrated undergraduate efforts to support the strike, also said they were happy that the two parties reached an agreement. Some SLAM affiliates expressed concern, however, that the lengthy strike—during which picketing workers received just $40 a day from the union’s strike fund—would take its toll.
“A lot of workers were without pay, and they’re still suffering the consequences of that,” Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17 said. “It’s something that’s serious and we’ll have to take a look into.”
Grace F. Evans ’19 added that it was “pretty unimaginable that low income workers did not receive an income for 21 days.”
Still, in a post on the group’s Facebook page, SLAM praised the “thousands of students” who supported the strike and the workers who continued to picket throughout.
“Together, we proved that worker power is unstoppable, student power is unstoppable, and a united community can't be beat,” the post read.

Reduced rainfall in Massachusetts and parts of the Northeast since May has pushed Cambridge’s local reservoirs to their lowest volume in at least 10 years, driving the city to purchase millions of dollars of water.
Cambridge has used $3.6 million of the Cambridge Water Department’s water fund to purchase three months’ worth of water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, according to Sam Corda, the managing director of the Cambridge Water Department.
As of last Thursday, the U.S. Drought Monitor indicated that northeastern Massachusetts, including the Cambridge and Boston area, remained in a state of “extreme drought,” which is the index’s second highest level of drought severity.Since Oct. 11, the water delivered to Cambridge residents has consisted of 90 percent water from the MWRA and 10 percent from Cambridge’s own water system, according to Corda.
Cambridge maintains its own water system, which includes the Hobbs Brook Reservoir, Stony Brook Reservoir, and Fresh Pond Reservoir. Combined, the three reservoirs hold up to approximately 4.4 billion gallons of water and can last eight months when full, but have recently only been filled to 25 percent of total capacity, Corda said.
Unlike the Cambridge water supply, the MWRA system continues to operate at normal levels. Corda said that, as a MWRA member, Cambridge has been able to access the regional supply, but at a higher cost.
“The costs to produce our own water versus the cost to buy water from the MWRA is a 2:1 ratio,” Corda said. He added that the economic impact on consumers will depend on the drought’s duration, but could affect water bills in the next fiscal year.
“We’re going to continue doing the 90:10 [ratio] until our reservoirs are recovered some, and at some point, we’re hoping that we continue to get rain and minimize the MWRA water costs, because obviously, that’s a significant cost for us,” Corda stated.
Corda said short-term weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predict continued drought conditions for the next three months, but that long-term forecasts predict higher-than-average rainfall for the last quarter of 2017.
Kenneth Strzepek, an adjunct professor at the Kennedy School who specializes in water resource management, said the combination of Cambridge’s local water system and its membership in the MWRA has enabled Cambridge to maintain its water supply amidst a “serious condition.”
“I think that Cambridge has done a pretty good job, they’ve developed a system that’s quite robust,” Strzepek said. He contrasted Cambridge’s MWRA membership with other U.S. municipalities that dropped their membership from regional water supplies and were then unable to immediately purchase water from regional systems during emergencies.
“If you look at Flint, Michigan… Flint was trying to save money and pulled out of their existing system, and when they had a problem, the other system wouldn’t let them back in,” Strzepek stated.
Corda said that, in response to the drought, Cambridge has cut municipal outdoor irrigation by 50 percent and implemented water conservation initiatives. While conservation guidelines for residents and institutions are currently “strongly recommended,” Corda said these recommendations could become “mandatory” restrictions in the spring, depending on drought conditions.
In an emailed statement, Colin Durrant, a spokesperson for the Harvard Office for Sustainability, indicated the University was aware of the drought.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an event celebrating the accomplishments of the late Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid, the Graduate School of Design unveiled a new scholarship to provide financial assistance to Middle Eastern students on Tuesday.
Hadid, who taught at the GSD in 1986 and 1994, is the first woman to have won the the Pritzker Architecture Prize, which some consider to be the top architecture prize.
Tuesday’s event in Piper Auditorium was the second time the GSD honored Hadid—the school held an event in March mourning her immediately following her death from a sudden heart attack at the age of 65.
At the event, GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi unveiled the Zaha Hadid/Omniyat Fellowship Fund to provide financial aid to Masters in Architecture Degree candidates who are residents or citizens of Middle Eastern countries. The fellowship will be sponsored by the Dubai-based real estate firm Omniyat.
“This scholarship will stand as a lasting tribute to this artist who brought people together,” Omniyat CEO Mahdi K. M. J. Amjad said. “It is my desire for this fellowship to find the next Zaha Hadid from our region.”
Tuesday’s event kicked off with opening remarks by Mostafavi, a personal friend of Hadid, followed by other speakers who all knew Hadid in varying capacities.
Elia Zenghelis, who was one of Hadid’s first teachers, said Hadid was more than just a student to him.
“It wasn’t necessarily a student-teacher relationship,” Zenghelis said. “It was more like losing a daughter.”
Patrik Schumacher, Hadid’s professional partner, ran through some of Hadid’s greatest professional accomplishments. Meanwhile, Xin Zhang, CEO of Chinese real estate developer SOHO China, recounted the progression of her personal relationship with Hadid—from Zhang firing Hadid in their first encounter to Hadid becoming one of Zhang’s closest friends.
“She’s a very authentic person. I have never met someone as fearless as Zaha,” Zhang, who had contracted Hadid to design 14.7 million square feet of buildings in China, said. “Her work radiates that fearlessness and that authentic spirit.”
Students who attended the event said they appreciated the multiplicity of perspectives presented on Zaha as a person and a professional.
“I think the bringing different perspectives like the partner, the teacher, and the client was really interesting to show the actual process of what makes her as special as she is today,” GSD student Wilson Harkhono said.
Mostafavi concluded the event by requesting that discussions about the importance of Hadid’s work continue.

Participants in the International Women’s Day Radio Project, a radio festival which ran in Boston from 1978 to 1993, came together for their first reunion to recount memories of the initiative Tuesday evening in a panel hosted by the Harvard Museum of Science and Culture.
The project was an annual 24-hour marathon of radio programming planned and run by women during the spring in Boston. Panelists said it started as a way to address the lack of women’s voices on mainstream radio broadcasts at the time. The project sought to discuss women’s issues and feature women’s music and poetry.
The panel consisted of founding members and participants of the project, and was moderated by professor Evelynn M. Hammonds. She highlighted the historical significance of the project and its lasting impact.
“They carried the need for women’s voices to be in the airwaves into everything they did,” Hammonds, who is a professor of the History of Science and of African and African American Studies, said. “It had a legacy that went on and continues even now.”
Panelist Anita McFadden, one of the founders, commented on the fact that many audience members had listened to the program decades ago.
“I’m just amazed because you all were listening [when the project was running],” she said. The audience erupted into cheers and applause.
She went on to highlight the novelty of the project’s concept during the 70s and 80s.
“Back then, you could hardly read the news [as a woman], much less host a show and be prominent in the media in that way,” she said.
Melanie Berzon, another panelist, said she was drawn to radio broadcasting because she hoped to understand a more diverse range of people. Berzon has remained active in radio broadcasting since participating in the initiative the 1970s.
“I believe that if we get to know a people, if we get to know their music, their culture, their lives, what they listen to, what they dance to, then it’s harder to hate them, to oppress them, to exclude them,” she said. “[The project] gave us the opportunity to put that philosophy into practice.”
The panelists said that besides its role as an outlet for women’s issues, the project also fostered an inclusive, welcoming environment.
“For me to walk into this group of women and be welcomed with open arms, and have professionals step up and say that 'I’ll work with you' meant the world to me,” Rushin said.
Nancy H. Hughes, a member of the audience and a former project participant, appreciated the event’s role in reuniting the women and sharing their stories as “living history.”

The University notified thousands of students eligible to vote in the coming union election that some of their personal information will be given to the National Labor Relations Board and to the graduate student union effort, in accordance with NLRB rules.
In an email to student teaching and research assistants, Office of Labor and Employee Relations Director Paul R. Curran wrote that the University is “required” to provide names, current employment positions, the school or department in which a student works, and contact information such as mailing address, email address, and phone number to both parties.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers reached an agreement with University officials last week regarding where and when to hold the election, in which students will vote “yes” or “no” on whether they wish to be represented by the union for the purposes of collective bargaining.
The parties also agreed on which students would be included in the potential bargaining unit: graduate and undergraduate teaching fellows, including teaching and course assistants, as well as graduate student research assistants.
“Our records indicate that you currently hold one of those positions, which means that you will be eligible to cast a vote in the election,” Curran wrote. “If a majority of those voting choose to be represented by the union, you would be included in the bargaining unit with your terms of employment subject to union negotiation.”
In any unionization election, the NLRB requires an employer “to supply, on request, information that is ‘relevant and necessary’ to allow the employees’ representative to bargain intelligently and effectively with respect to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment,” according to the Board’s website.
“Obtaining a list of voters and making contact information available is a normal part of the NLRB process. This list of voters allows us to ensure that our union democratically represents the interests of all student workers,” HGSU-UAW spokesperson and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email.
Curran wrote that the NLRB issued a subpoena to the University outlining which information it required, and that the University notified students in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. He added that the information will be given to the NLRB “on or about” Oct. 28, and to the HGSU-UAW “shortly thereafter.”
“You have the right to object to the subpoena and release of your personal information. If you want to object, it is not sufficient to notify Harvard,” Curran wrote, adding that students must direct objections to the NLRB.
Shira Li ’19, an undergraduate course assistant, said she plans to call the NLRB tomorrow to see how much effort it will take to withhold her information.
“I would be okay with it either way, but if possible I would prefer not to give out that information,” Li said. “I was okay with the information about me being a [course assistant] and my name, but I was mostly concerned about, like, address and phone number, that kind of stuff being given out.”
Ph.D. student Holly M. Dykstra, who is not involved in the union effort, said she did not have an issue with her information being shared to the NLRB and union effort.
“I didn’t know how the details about this worked and how they would know who’s a worker beforehand, but this seems pretty benign,” Dykstra said.
Undergraduates also received an email from Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. He wrote that his remarks were a follow-up to Curran’s email, “which, I imagine, may have come as a surprise to you.”
“My primary purpose in following up on this message is to impress upon you the importance of engaging with this process, which may well have a significant impact on you, the College, and the University,” Harris wrote. “Please take the time to educate yourselves about the issues and to reflect on the impact of different possible outcomes.”
Harris then directed students to the Provost’s Office “Know before the Vote” website, and the HGSU-UAW website—linking to both sites in the email.
Responding to Harris’ decision to link to both websites, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven said, “The University continues to encourage a robust and open discussion true to Harvard’s tradition and practice of welcoming diverse views in an environment where all have an opportunity to be heard.”
Dykstra said she appreciates receiving information from the University and from the union effort. She signed up for the HGSU-UAW’s email list, and received an email when the group filed a petition to the NLRB on Oct. 18 to move forward with the election process.
“I also have a sense that students that haven’t been involved in the union—who are people I’ve talked to—want more information now, and there are still some questions that people feel like haven’t been answered,” Dykstra said.
The union election will be held Nov. 16 and 17.—Staff writer Leah S. Yared can be reached at leah.yared@thecrimson.com. Follow her on Twitter @Leah_Yared.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two straight weeks, two straight interesting results for the Harvard football team.
Leading up to the Crimson’s final nonconference matchup of the season against Holy Cross, I was dismissive of the fact several key starters had to sit with injuries. Even without its top performers, Harvard would, in typical fashion, grind out a victory.
Well, I was mistaken. The Crusaders delivered a convincing blow to the Crimson in Worcester—one that left me struggling to find a positive element to Harvard’s performance. The offense looked sloppy in the 27-17 defeat, and the defense was no more than adequate.
A bounceback week against Princeton was expected, and that expectation proved correct this time around. The Tigers have a good team, and accordingly, Saturday’s contest went down to the wire.
After Princeton kicker Tavish Rice nailed a 25-yard field goal on the first overtime possession, senior quarterback Joe Viviano countered with a diving reach into the end zone for the clinching score. Harvard walked away from New Jersey with a 23-20 victory.
Now, Harvard football (5-1, 3-0 Ivy) is at a bit of a crossroads. Following four games in which it only trailed once—3-0 to Brown in the first quarter of its second game—the Crimson has faltered a bit.
Will Harvard continue on the tried-and-true road of dominance through the Ivy League en route to another Ancient Eight title? This is very likely. I have watched precious few teams that seem so sure to win on a weekly basis.
But there is a chance the Crimson falls off its beaten path. Harvard’s looming road bout with Penn on Nov. 11 will be the defining game of the 2016 season, as the Quakers are also unbeaten in the Ivy League at 3-0. Princeton could also challenge these two for the Ivy championship, as the Tigers’ loss Saturday marks the only blemish on their conference record thus far.
In case Harvard does not win out, let’s revisit the last time the Crimson actually lost multiple games in a season.
Actually, this was not long ago. In 2012, Harvard dropped a 39-34 decision on the road against Princeton and fell to Penn in the penultimate game of the year, 30-21.
So Harvard football is not invincible. However, the fact an 8-2 record falls under this kind of scrutiny is impressive in itself. In fact, you would have to go back nearly to the beginning of coach Tim Murphy’s reign to find a Crimson team with a losing record.
That year was 1998. Harvard finished 4-6, but what else was going on in 1998?
Well, I was barely one year old. The cost of a gallon of gas was only slightly more than one dollar. Mark Zuckerberg (or the Winklevoss twins, depending on whom you believe) had not yet revolutionized the concept of social networking.
The point is, the year 1998 now seems like the distant past. So does 1995, when the Crimson won just two games—its lowest mark under Coach Murphy. And so does the entire stretch between 1988 and 1993 before he got there when Harvard failed to produce a winning record.
In fact, the contrast between now and then makes you wonder if there has been an era more dominant for Harvard football than the beginning of the 21st century.
Well, there was one. In the days when football was almost indistinguishable from rugby, the Crimson dominated the collegiate football scene. Harvard won nine national championships between 1890 and 1919.
Take the 1890 squad as an unrealistic, and frankly baffling, example of the Crimson’s prowess. This team allowed a total of 12 points in 11 games. Yes, barely more than a point per game.
Before you dismiss this low scoring trend as the product of a violent age of football in which there were more broken bones per game than points scored, take a look at Harvard’s offensive output. The electric 1890 offense totaled 555 points in those 11 games.
Regardless of what ends up happening in the Crimson’s final four games, the 2016 season will surely not stand out like the 1890 or 1995 seasons did. However, history is not always made year by year. When viewed in the context of the last 20-plus seasons, this era of Harvard football is historic indeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final stretch of the season, the Harvard men’s soccer team has found its groove. Behind junior defenseman Eric Gylling’s double-overtime winner Tuesday night, the Crimson outlasted New Hampshire, 2-1, extending its current unbeaten streak to eight games.
“We really stuck it out,” junior goalie Kyle Parks said. “New Hampshire’s a really good team. We stuck to our game plan and got the result we wanted.”
After the two teams were even at one following the first 90 minutes, the opening half of overtime and much of the second were scoreless, with both teams unable to break through the other’s defense. Then, with 4:27 left in the final frame, junior midfielder Sam Brown found himself taking a corner kick for the Crimson.
UNH goalie Andrew Pesci was able to bat the ball away, but not to one of his own players—to Gylling. Gylling then beat Pesci for his third goal of the season, giving the Crimson (9-3-2, 3-0-1 Ivy) a win in its final nonconference tilt of the year. All three of Gylling’s goals this year have been game-winners.
Back in the first half, both sides were well matched, with neither side allowing more than a couple of shots. Harvard’s sophomore forward Cesar Farias did manage to get a shot off in the first five minutes of the game—and one might have judged from the past couple of games where the team would kick into high gear early on, that it would be the same case in this game.
But UNH (11-5, 3-2 America East) doubled down on defense after this first shot by Harvard, and the Crimson would not take a shot for another 15 minutes. Yet while the offense was unable to make anything happen in the first half, the defense made sure to shut down any possible chance that the Wildcats might have had. Both teams registered just two shots in the first half.
“I think we did a fantastic job defensively,” Parks said.
Meanwhile, on the offensive end, the Crimson remained positive.
“We know what we do well, and we fall back on that,” senior defender Alex Leondis said. “Even though we’re not getting a lot of shots in the first half, we’re not going to change the way we play. We have confidence and we were able to play and perform. We just stuck with that, and we didn’t really panic, and I think that helped settle us in the second half.”
It was in the second half that the Crimson stepped up its offense to find new ways to get into the attacking third. UNH earned the first chances of the frame, but the Crimson got onto the scoreboard first.
After driving down the field in the 59th minute, Harvard got a corner kick. Brown drove the ball to the far post, where senior defender Daniel Smith was waiting. Smith, with a clean look and an opportunity to get a shot off, headed the ball and scored the opening goal of the game and his second of the season.
Any relief the Crimson felt at finally scoring, however, was quickly dampened three minutes later when UNH’s Chris Wingate scored his fourth goal of the season on a one-timer after receiving a pass from teammate Lalaina Randriamanantena.
The ball would not find the back of the net for another 40 minutes, as the contest continued on into overtime, but Gylling’s winner now has the Crimson six games above .500 with three conference games remaining in the 2016 campaign.
“I think it was a good game, I think both teams played very well overall,” Leondis said. “We just fought a battle the entire game and I was really impressed by our constant mentality and energy we brought and luckily that continued into overtime. It was a tough fought match so it was good to walk away with a win.”

You probably received more emails than texts yesterday. You might have refreshed your inbox as often as your Facebook feed. You possibly spent an equal amount of time responding to emails as doing your pset. Let’s face it, email takes over our lives as Harvard students. Here are the things that can make email that extra bit worse.
“Replying all” to a mailing list: Maybe you sent your hilarious comment intended for your friend to your whole house. Or maybe you wanted to take this opportunity to campaign for UC. Or you thought everyone needed to be informed that you want to be taken off this mailing list. Whatever it is, we don’t need yet another email in our overflowing inboxes from you.
Pubbing irrelevant events over a mailing list: Let’s face it, no one in the Republican Club is interested in the #happier Halloween discussion event. Keep your lists separate, and our unread email count will thank you.
Sending a one word response: “Okay”–it is the ultimate conversation killer. We labored over the phrasing of an email to you, our favorite professor, and you responded with one word. Worse, your assistant responded on your behalf and our well-crafted email was for nothing.
Taking a month to respond: We waited patiently as you spent a whole month replying to our email. Then we emailed you back immediately. And you spent another few weeks replying to that one. We know you check your email on your phone when you’re bored in math lecture–punctuality would be appreciated.
Taking 6 paragraphs to say nothing: @DeanKhurana, we see you and your strategic neutrality over the HUDS strike. Seriously, we just want to know if the strike is over. But you make us comb through 1000 words of diplomacy to be assured that soft serve will return to Annenberg.
We’re talking to you–housemates, professors, Dean Khurana–and we would just like to say: dude, that’s rude.
