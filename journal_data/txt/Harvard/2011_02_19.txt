After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—After losing twice to Cornell a year ago, Harvard has returned the favor, winning at Newman Arena Friday night, 73-60, to complete the season sweep of the Big Red. The victory gave the Crimson (19-4, 8-1 Ivy) its best start to conference play in program history.
“We’re pleased,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[Newman] was a tough place to play for so many years and for so many teams because of how well [Cornell] played here. So anytime you can get a victory here, it’s a nice moment.”
The Crimson dominated the game from start to finish. Sophomore forward Christian Webster continued his hot shooting from last weekend with a three pointer from the left corner to open the game, and junior co-captain Keith Wright scored on a post-up the next possession.
After a baseline jumper from forward Errick Peck put the Big Red (6-17, 2-7) on the board, Harvard hit five of seven free throws, and sophomore guard Brandyn Curry hit a floater in the lane to give the Crimson a 12-2 lead with 14:40 left.
“We played very well in stretches,” Amaker said. “I thought we had a very good first half.”
Cornell managed to whittle the margin down to four points over the next five minutes, but it would never come closer to taking the lead. Harvard went to the free throw line time after time and methodically built its advantage. In the opening frame, the Crimson went 16-of-18 from the charity stripe, while the Big Red shot just 2-for-2, and Harvard headed into intermission with a 37-24 lead.
“One of the biggest things coach harps on, definitely, is get to the free throw line,” Curry said. “He wants us to be the No. 1 free throw shooting team in the conference; he wants us to take the most and make the most.”
No one used the line better than Webster. Twice in the first half, the sophomore was fouled on a three-point attempt and then proceeded to convert all three free throws. In the second half, Webster was even fouled as he hit a trey and went on to complete the four-point play.
The forward finished the night as the game’s leading scorer, pouring in 20 points on 4-of-8 shooting, including 3-of-6 from three and 9-of-9 from the stripe.
“He’s an offensive player, and most offensive players, if they can see the ball go in the basket—whether it’s a free throw or an easy shot—they find a little bit of a rhythm,” Amaker said. “I thought that’s what happened with [Webster].”
The guard play of Curry was at least on par with his classmate’s performance. Curry hit his first five shots from the floor—an assortment of runners in the lane and three pointers—and knocked down all six of his free throws en route to scoring a season-high 18 points.
But Curry was just as instrumental facilitating shots for others. He tallied five assists and put his teammates in position to get to the free throw line numerous times.
“He did a great job...making plays for us,” Webster said. “I mean, that’s what he does, and he did a great job tonight.”
Behind Webster and Curry, the Crimson built a lead as large as 21 points in the second half. Harvard got to the line 17 more times in the second frame and finished the night shooting 29-of-35 from the stripe. Cornell, by comparison, was 6-of-6 in the game.
Three three pointers from Big Red guard Drew Ferry—Cornell’s leading scorer with 12 points—cut into the Crimson’s advantage late, but the final result was never in doubt. The Crimson took the game, 73-60.
“We talked to our kids about still growing,” Amaker said. “It’s the ‘dog days’—quote-unquote—of February...but I wanted them to embrace to notion that we can still grow as a team...we still have moments that we can improve and grow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—When junior co-captain Oliver McNally had to be helped off the floor after suffering an ankle injury during last weekend’s matchup with Brown, some Harvard fans wondered whether they would see McNally on the court again this season.
But McNally cast all fears aside Friday night, returning to the starting lineup for the Crimson’s contest against Cornell.
“I was really pleased to see him play the number of minutes he played coming off of the injury he had last weekend,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
Despite suffering from cramps, McNally played 30 minutes, totaling four points, three assists, and one rebound. But according to the coach, McNally brought more to the game than could be reflected in a stat sheet.
“He has a great way of leading our team in a number of different ways,” Amaker said. “I told Oliver at halftime: he didn’t score, but I just thought he was one of our more valuable players out there…he was very active defensively, and you heard his voice a lot all night.”
According to McNally’s teammates, the guard’s ankle injury should not keep him off the court for the remainder of the season.
“He’s real tough,” sophomore Christian Webster said. "He’ll play through it. He might not be 100 percent, but he’s going to give it his all.”
THE WRIGHT STUFF
While junior co-captain Keith Wright finished as just the Crimson’s fourth-leading scorer, the forward quietly picked up his 10th double-double of the season.
In 29 minutes of play, Wright notched 10 points on four shots and grabbed 11 boards.
Harvard looked for Wright in the post in the early going, but the Big Red consistently sent a help defender at the big man when he caught the ball on the block.
After notching three points in the first 3:16 of play, Wright did not attempt another shot until 13:16 remained in the first half.
Instead, the forward helped distribute the ball to the Crimson’s guards on the perimeter.
“It starts with Keith and [sophomore] Kyle [Casey],” said Webster, who finished with 20 points on three treys. “When we ball-faked it inside, the whole defense collapsed, and then I’m just wide-open on the weak side.”
Wright also made his presence felt on the offensive glass, picking up a game-high six offensive rebounds.
“[His play] was tremendous,” Webster said. “Keith did a great job getting on the backboard.”
Wright’s 10 points mark his lowest offensive output in conference play. Heading into Friday’s contest, Wright was averaging 17.9 points per game in Ivy League play.
Casey—Wright’s frontcourt counterpart—also had a relatively quiet offensive night, finishing with 11 points on eight shot attempts.
But Casey drew attention to himself on one play in particular. With just 1:39 remaining and the Crimson sporting a 73-56 lead, Casey threw down a ferocious one-handed tip slam off a missed layup from classmate Brandyn Curry.
The dunk gave Casey his 11th point on the night, marking the seventh straight game in which the forward has scored in double figures.
NOW BOARDING
While the Crimson dominated most facets of the game against Cornell, Harvard struggled in one area in particular: defensive rebounding.
The Big Red pulled down 15 offensive boards and outrebounded the Crimson, 32-29.
Senior forward Mark Coury led the charge for Cornell, grabbing five offensive and two defensive rebounds. Three other players—Miles Asafo-Adjei, Drew Ferry, and Adam Wire—added five boards apiece.
“In order to beat us, they had to get on the backboards,” Webster said. “They were just ferocious trying to get offensive rebounds.”
The Big Red made the most of the added opportunities, finishing with 15 second-chance points.
While Wright and Casey led the Crimson with 11 and seven rebounds, respectively, the duo did not receive much help from its teammates on the glass. The rest of the Harvard squad combined for just 10 rebounds.
“We weren’t blocking out,” Amaker said. “I think we were just turning to rebound, and that ball takes a funny bounce...and you’re not going to be in position to rebound.”

While many around campus have been enjoying the recent rise in temperature, some of the effects of the warm weather have not been quite as positive. In addition to enormous puddles of melted snow, there is now another hazard to consider on your way to class: falling ice.
Leverett House Master and Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics Howard M. Georgi '68 experienced this peril firsthand. His car was damaged when a chunk of ice weighing approximately 20 pounds grazed the side of his car, which was parked on Mill Street, earlier this week.
The slab of ice was dislodged from the roof of the Master’s residence as a result of this week's sudden temperature change. The damage to the car was, for the most part, superficial and included a dented door.
"[It] could have been a lot worse for the car, and we are very thankful that it didn't hit any pedestrians," Georgi wrote in an e-mail.
Efforts are now underway to clear the remaining cars that may potentially be at risk. Several cars around Mill Street have already been moved, and maintenance workers are attempting to remove blocks of ice from nearby roofs, Leverett House Building Manager Paul J. Hegarty wrote in an e-mailed statement.
