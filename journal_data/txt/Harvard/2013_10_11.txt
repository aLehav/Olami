After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Pirates seem archaic and fanciful until one is waving a machine gun in your face and screaming for you to give him money that you do not have. This situation is exactly that in which Captain Richard Phillips, played outstandingly by Tom Hanks, finds himself. The 2009 capture of the tanker ship Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates is the perfect action film premise, and it may be said that “Captain Phillips,” the new movie documenting that capture, is nearly the perfect action film.
 
Viewers will by and large remember the facts of the incident. The Alabama, owned by Danish shipping company Maersk Line Ltd. and captained by Massachusetts-born Richard Phillips, was bound to Mombasa, Kenya from Djibouti with a cargo composed largely of American relief supplies. A band of Somali pirates, after a day of fruitless pursuit, managed to board the ship and hold the bridge crew hostage, eventually leaving with the $30,000 in the ship’s safe and Phillips himself, whom they intended to hold for ransom. “Captain Phillips” derives its power from the fact that writer Billy Ray and director Paul Greengrass show incredible restraint in their treatment of the story, seeking to portray the events with as much accuracy and as little comment as possible.
 
The screenplay is taken from Phillips’s own memoir of the events, and Greengrass does not attempt to impose an ideology or political message over it. There is none of the jingoistic glorification of American nationalism found in many biopics—the enormous, unforgettable American flag at the opening of “Patton” comes to mind. Nevertheless, the overt cynicism towards American institutions that has characterized some of Greengrass’s work—latent in the Bourne films, clearer in “Green Zone”—is also avoided. With this journalistic tone, the raw emotion of the events is communicated directly, without the interference of worries about character motivations. Indeed, motivations are left cryptic and unguessed at. Muse, the pirate captain played by Barkhad Abdi, is by turns sympathetic and genuinely menacing, but never predictable. Although he is complex, he is not explained, and so the viewer’s experience of him is like that of the ship’s crew—at the surface and no deeper, with little understanding and much fear.
 
This experience is enhanced by the camerawork of cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who is probably best known for his work on for “The Hurt Locker.” The most notable camera technique in “Captain Phillips” is the effective use of what is a cancer of modern cinema—“shaky cam,” which has seen an explosion of popularity in documentary-style productions. In most instances, shaky cam is a crutch used to create a sense of verisimilitude and excitement by directors and cinematographers. While it can accomplish this end, it also tends to distract and to mask an inability to use artful framing and smooth camerawork. In this film, however, the well-choreographed chaos conveyed by shaky cam is at worst inoffensive, and at best very powerful. Ackroyd skillfully uses the technique to capture the breakneck pace of action maintained throughout the film.
 
Although “Captain Phillips” on the whole is very successful, there are a few places in which it falters; interestingly, the most notable moments of this failure are near the opening and closing, when the film is least action-driven. The captain’s dialogue with his wife at the beginning of the film is uninteresting, too long, and thematically unrelated to the rest of the plot, in addition to being a segment where shaky cam is not necessarily the preferred camera technique. At the film’s close, Hanks’s portrayal of Phillips’s emotional distress dips into melodrama and bathos, failing to evoke empathy so much as detached, perverse amusement. Nevertheless, these lapses are small, both in the amount of screen time they take and in the influence they have on the film as a whole.
 
“Captain Phillips” is one of the most effective films of the year and will likely be in the running for a number of Academy Awards. Its simple presentation of a gripping story puts it on par with such thriller classics as the original “The Taking of Pelham One Two Three” and sets it far ahead of the overproduced action films that have come to dominate so much of American cinema. For a well-crafted aesthetic experience, “Captain Phillips” is probably unrivaled by any other film playing nationally at this writing. It demands attention like a pirate’s pistol in your face.

In an unprecedented collaboration, the Museum of Fine Arts and the Brooklyn Museum have combined their collections to offer the public an extensive view of John Singer Sargent’s watercolor pieces. The installation, which opens Sunday, brings together 92 watercolors that show a more subtle side of Sargent’s artistic prowess. “This may not be the Sargent you think you know,” says Erica Hirschler, the MFA’s Croll Senior Curator of American Paintings.
The installation is organized not by chronology or location, but by themes that recur throughout Sargent’s artistic career. As all of the pieces were painted between 1902 and 1911, to organize by date would lead to abbreviated segments and fail to capture the continuity of Sargent’s interests across the two collections, Hirschler says. Rather, by centering rooms around around everyday motifs such as “Figures Lying Down” and “At Work,” the museum curators hope to shed light on Sargent’s love of the act of painting.
According to Hirschler, Sargent was particularly fond of painting shades of white, according to Hirschler. Some of Sargent’s more well-known pieces depict mundane scenes, such as a clothesline of white sheets and a marble rock quarry, which are rendered remarkable through his brush strokes. When he did paint portraits in watercolor, he was known to ask his sitters to wear white, and he took special delight in the varying hues of shadow he found in the folds of cloth. His watercolor “Corfu: Lights and Shadows” features a white shed cast in the shade of a tree, which is outside of the frame of the painting. “It is such a non-subject that Sargent makes into a great work of art,” Hirschler says.
By around 1904, Sargent had largely given up painting commissioned portraits, for which he was well known at the time. This was not, however, for lack of interest in painting people. According to Teresa Carbone, Andrew W. Mellon Curator of American Art at the Brooklyn Museum, Sargent was frustrated and bored with commissioned works. “For Sargent, they had very little in the way of psychological depth,” she says. Thus, the portraits that one does see in the exhibit—such as “The Tramp” and “Bedouins”—are painted with rich layers of both translucent and opaque paint, as well as with a certain sketchiness that allow for deeper meaning than that typically afforded by portraits.
The installation does pair a few watercolor pieces with their oil counterparts of the same image, an arrangement that frequently joins pieces from the Brooklyn and MFA collections. Carbone was, however, quick to note that the watercolors were not merely studies meant to prepare Sargent for his oil pieces, but rather stand-alone masterworks that were complete in themselves.
In transitioning from oil to watercolor, Sargent began to travel around the world, finding his muse in the gardens of Italy and Biblical sites in the Middle East. “He traveled to paint, not the other way around,” Hirschler says. During this time, Sargent did not paint his watercolors with the intention of selling them; many of these location-based studies were bought exclusively by either the Brooklyn Museum or the MFA. In fact, Sargent painted much of the MFA’s collection with the knowledge that the museum would purchase his next installation of watercolors.
Incorporating everything from colorful reflections on the clear water of Venetian canals to elongated shadows of Renaissance statues to a moment of rest atop the Swiss Alps, the MFA and Brooklyn Museum’s installation allows visitors to view both the everyday and the majestic through Sargent’s eyes. “We hope [the installation] is an inspiration for people to look around them and see sunlight captured and held,” Hirschler says.

Last month, Kanye West gave one of his signature self-aggrandizing interviews to BBC reporter Zane Lowe, with hilarious (though surely unintentionally so) results. In response to Mr. West’s assertion that he considers himself “the number one rock star on the planet,” talk show host Jimmy Kimmel responded with a satirical spoof of the interview in which he used young children to portray both West and Lowe. And to everyone’s great surprise, Kanye got mad and posted a series of caps-locked tweets condemning Kimmel’s actions. On Wednesday night the feud came to a head when West appeared on Kimmel’s show and gave a mostly one-sided interview about his place in society. Kimmel gave a semi-apology claiming he never meant to hurt West. But who was really in the wrong?
Team Kimmel
By Alexander Olapade
Let’s get the obvious out of the way first. Making fun of celebrities is Jimmy Kimmel’s job. Some comedians take this a step further, like Stephen Colbert and his farcical caricature of public figures he believes are conceited elitists in American politics and society. No one even blinks an eye when Colbert ridicules a Glenn Beck interview or a Ted Cruz speech, and these people are arguably as fervent about their causes as West is about his.
For all the racism whistleblowers out there, take a look at the array of celebrities Kimmel and other hosts regularly shoot down (Paris Hilton comes to mind). It’s easy to make accusations of racial prejudice, but in this case, Kimmel’s skit should just be taken at face value and enjoyed for the humor that comes from a regrettably-formed celebrity statement.
Kanye should be respected for his self-awareness and the fact that he’s had to swim upstream all his life to “make it,” but that fact and Kimmel’s response to Kanye’s quote are unrelated.
Team Kanye
By David J. Kurlander
Kanye West’s Twitter feed pulsated with frustration only minutes after Jimmy Kimmel’s offensive recreation of West’s revelatory interview with BBC host Zane Lowe. Especially accurate and incendiary was Yeezy’s “JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS.” Whatever anyone says about potentially racially-motivated elements in the Kanye-Kimmel saga, “honesty” is the most crucial theme.
No other pop culture figure has fought against the exponentially multiplying cynicism and snarkiness in media today more than Kanye. From the start, whether going unscripted on telethons, speaking his mind at award shows, or expressing his disdain for the paparazzi, Kanye has pushed against the corporatization and predictability of pop culture in consistently unexpected ways. Originally a far more outspoken and controversial figure himself, Kimmel has allowed ABC to mold him into a relatively bland late-night host largely indistinguishable from his contemporaries (in fact, the Kanye skit is the first polarizing thing he’s done in quite a while). As a result, he has become a castrated figure, making fun of any figure who shows hints of vulnerability. Why wouldn’t Jimmy Kimmel be jealous and want to paint West as a child?
Kimmel minimizes Kanye’s bravado, entrepreneurship, and enthusiasm because Kanye uses those skills to counteract exactly what Kimmel, and much of the pop-culture community, has become: a nastily ironic tool for the status quo. Kanye is entirely capable of irony (as in the “Watch the Throne” track “New Day”: “I mean I might even make [my son] be Republican / So everybody know he love white people”), but instead of using his irony as a filter, Kanye allows himself to emote unfettered. It’s not surprising that Kimmel and the rest of the networks see that as infantile, but those who still believe in genuineness all know who the real children are.

It is not every day that one gets the chance to walk through the life of a filmmaker, writer, and actress all in the span of two hours. “LOST CHILD!”—a one-woman one-act staged by the Institute of Contemporary Arts on Sunday—was written and performed by Miranda July, the versatile artist whose fiction has been published in “The New Yorker” and “The Paris Review” and whose films have appeared in the Sundance Film Festival. The show combined elements of soap opera drama, such as when July talked about her romantic relationships with men and women, with real life struggles such as finding a job. The play told the clichéd story of a small town girl trying to make it big in the world, but the honest and personable style of July’s delivery made the show her own and gave the performance nuance and meaning.
July’s work has appeared in the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum, and her films have won her four prizes at the Cannes Film Festival. However, “LOST CHILD!” was acted out in a simple conversational set-up, where July spoke to the audience about her life leading up to becoming the artist that she is today. The personal feel that comes from this set-up was very suitable for the sensitive topics that July touched on.
Standing alone in the spotlight, July laid out her journey of becoming an artist through a collage of video clips and journal entries from the past. She spoke about the obstacles that she faced while trying to make a living through her passion for art and filmmaking. Aided by the simple lighting design by Lauren Audette, July stayed in the spotlight throughout the show. She worked with basic technology, like her laptop, and showed a series of webcam videos from her past as well as old movies she made from filming over “Superman” VHS tapes. The interactive atmosphere that July created brought to life her journey and her growth as an artist and as a person. She asked members of the audience to recite movie transcripts along with her, and as her movies started to take form and move away from the juvenile filming she did in the past, July seemed to mature as an artistic mind.
The plot, however, was by no means original or revolutionary. The story was one that every small-town girl trying to make it big as an artist could have told. From stealing knockoff Reebok shoes at Payless to making small bombs with her criminal girlfriend, July’s journey of becoming an artist, although quirky, is not monumentally unique. But what separated this performance from other clichéd tales of artistic journeys was the delivery of her story. July’s attitude was toned down and relaxed—it was a presentation that could have very well been told over a Sunday brunch or a walk in the park.
“LOST CHILD!” wasn’t exactly an inspirational anecdote, nor was it one to be remembered for ages to come. However, it did have heart and emotion that brought to life a complicated narrative that was not entirely plot-driven. July told her story as it was—no dramatic effects, no flashy sets, just her and her story. This kind of style is hard to find in today’s entertainment industry, but July did it beautifully with her casual approach to the play. It is only through the use of this kind of simple delivery style that July was able to meaningfully present her artistic journey.

The Adams Pool used to be a literal swimming pool as well as a place of free expression for students of all sexualities. In the 1990s, the Pool was transformed into a theater, and tonight, on National Coming Out Day, “#Queers” will explore modern queer relationships, a nod to the Pool’s promiscuous past. This student-written comedy, consisting of two one-acts, will run until Sunday.
 
Michael Shayan ’14, the play’s writer and director, is conscious of the lasting significance of the space. “In our play there is a sex club scene, which is sort of a modern revisiting of this space, and of queer space more generally at Harvard.”
 
The day of the release, though coincidental, also holds importance for the show. “I think it’s kind of apt that the show is opening on the same day as Coming Out Day,” actor Alexander M. Willis ’14 says. “One of the themes the show explores is being comfortable with your sexuality and what being gay means.”
 
The first one-act, “Don’t Say Gay,” is a satire about sensational claims over homosexuality—the act depicts an interaction between talk show host Phyllis (Mariah T. Brown ’15) and her crazed assistant Dan (Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15). The second one-act, “Kisses,” depicts a frustrated love triangle between Shawn (Michael S. Gellman ’17), who is in love with Matt (Willis), who already has a girlfriend, Lindsay (Karoline K. Xu ’16).
 
Shayan says that the show has no larger political agenda, and Willis adds that the production promises to be very funny. “I was really excited about how outrageous I thought the play would be...because I know Michael is a really funny guy,” Willis says.
 Humor aside, Shayan wants his audience to take away a larger idea from the show. “I want people to think about the ways they relate with each other and to consider the games that we play in our relationships,” Shayan says. “It’s about love and heartbreak. Love is hard and we deal with it.”

Most op-eds tell you what to think. I’m going to tell you what to do.
And that is this: Go to the Science Center Plaza on Thursday between noon and 2 p.m. Follow the squeals, either human or piglet. And discover Harvard’s latest common spaces initiative.
For those of you who have not yet received at least one all-caps text from a roommate about this, an explanation: The Common Spaces program has instituted a weekly petting zoo, filled with aww types of animals: chicks, ducklings, bunnies, and the rest of the cast of your typical Easter greeting card. Professors stop to nuzzle lambs. Toddlers touch goats and then look terrified. And students, of course, are snapchatting kitten pictures like it’s going to get them a McKinsey interview.
The business that facilitates this madness, the aptly named Animal Craze, is not shy about why Common Spaces has hired it. Signs on most of the cages advertise it as a “pet therapy zoo.” And I have to admit that, at first, I found the whole thing laughable. Amid repeated student efforts to emphasize the need for better mental health services—and administration attempts to improve them—Harvard had decided to add a somewhat unorthodox measure to relieve student stress. For this reason I was skeptical—I didn’t want to see any “pet therapy zoos” until improvements are made to mental health services at Harvard.
But then I went. And, while it might have been just been a brief part of my day, it was a nice one. Because, although efforts like the petting zoo may be small, they do make a difference.
Although a few moments of bunny lovin’ aren’t going to eradicate a decade-long battle with perfectionism—or depression, or any of the other myriad struggles that we face within our community—it can still help in the moment. Studies on animal-assisted therapy have shown positive effects for patients dealing with schizophrenia and sexual assault. Shorter-term programs, in which therapy dogs visit hospitals or nursing homes, also exist around the country. And, at the petting zoo, the excitement is evident—the mood sure feels quite a bit different than Lamont on a Sunday night.
Little things like the petting zoo may not solve problems, but they can provide a moment’s peace. It was the same way with the daffodils that magically appeared in the Science Center plaza last spring. Intended as a bright spot in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, they worked for the moment—the campus was brighter, both in mood and in aesthetics. The same goes for the weekly farmers’ and art markets that bring community members and creativity into the sometimes suffocating Harvard bubble. These things might seem small, or frivolous, or just silly, but they serve as a strong reminder that little tweaks in day-to-day life can make a short-term difference.
I understand, of course, that some animals or flowers (or an ice cream truck or gigantic chessboard) won’t fully alleviate the larger concerns about mental health that prompted a student rally last winter. But I understand also that it takes time to wade through budget reevaluations, professional development, and all the other red tape that makes change within a multi-thousand-member community difficult. As the increase in panels and student outreach last year showed, MHS is trying to make well-informed changes, even if they are not moving as quickly or efficiently toward improvement as we might like.
So, in the meantime, grab yourself a duckling. It can’t hurt.

“When I was 17, I had wrists like steel / And I felt complete,” croons Ezra Koenig in “Giving Up the Gun,” a song to which I was particularly given when I was seventeen myself. To this day, I think it a good mantra for intellectualized seventeen-year-old maleness in all its invincibility and unbridled individualism.
My initiation into pure, triumphalist classical liberalism did to some degree have its roots into the spirit of my age: “You can’t tell me what to do.” But more than anything, it was a rebellion against longstanding, self-imposed order.
By casual accident of my parents’ soft-R partisan affiliation, I entered the world of political consciousness as a self-identified Republican. By my early adolescence, my childish admiration for John McCain had blossomed into something much more dramatic: a tyrannical, rigid religious puritanism (much more Calvinist than Jewish in its character, little did I know), wedded to a Weekly Standard-style giddiness for imperial adventure. Political circumstance, having packaged these things together with a belief in unbridled corporatism, had me stumping for rock-bottom tax rates as well. To my credit, I was moderate on guns and immigration.
Recovery from this miserable worldview was an exercise in both the personal and the political: I succumbed to the commonsense truth of evolutionary theory. I became a “Powell Doctrine” realist after studying the follies of neocon warmongers. I rejected the Torah as divine writ after admitting to myself that history didn’t bear out its narrative claims. My Iron Age theology eroded into deism and, very soon, into nothing at all. All the dissonance and intrusive structure evaporated in an instant. Freedom.
Freedom, I have since accepted, isn’t free. But in the meantime, I spent my late high school years sitting up all night with fellow freethinking friends, denying value, breaking all existence down into constructs, and pooh-poohing “the rules” and “authority.” I entered Harvard as a perfect classical liberal, a libertarian tempered by pragmatism who reveled in stirring up Hillel dinner conversations with nihilistic confessions, reliably followed by the cheery, enigmatic qualifier: “But if nothing matters, then the fact that nothing matters doesn’t matter!”
I had no patience for either the social conservatives on campus, brimming with epistemological certainty and fanatical sexual idealism, or the left-liberals – bleeding-hearts with their own sacred cows, grown too comfortable in the Ivy League echo chamber. I joined neither party, I zoned out of American politics, and I made a big deal out of voting for Gary Johnson. (I would again, to be fair.)
Over the last few years, I have come to learn a lot from both groups’ styles of thinking. That is to say, I’m no longer so sure about the triumph of the unbridled individualism—in issues of culture or markets. The experience of growing up found tremendous resonance in Jon Haidt’s “The Righteous Mind” and Steven Pinker’s “The Better Angels of Our Nature”—two masterfully pragmatic cases for classical conservatism made by liberal psychologists.
In a strange development, I find that I agree with the basic thrust of the campus Right’s jeremiads against the excesses of soulless hook-up culture—but one of many “conservative” realizations about the drivers of anomie in a society of endless choices and attenuated consequences. If they weren’t so insistent that we were all going to hell for it, I might sign up.
A world without religion, rotary clubs, wealth-equalizing measures, and norms of decency might be a better one for me, Joshua Lipson. But data and intuitive reflection make eminently clear that it’d be a worse world for all of us—devoid of such existential essentials as structure, comfort, and subjective value. The complex and yet compassionate arguments of Jane Jacobs, Robert Putnam, Jaron Lanier, and Jon Haidt ring far truer than the easy, brutal triumphalism of Ayn Rand (and, I’m tempted to say, Ray Kurzweil).
What my new sympathy for Burke and “The American Conservative” does not mean, however, is an increase in sympathy for the Republican Party: a strange coalition of corporate fetishists, jingoistic bullies, and uncareful thinkers of all stripes. Though Democrats are no angels—and no classical liberals, the Right likes to remind us!—it is hard to think of anything more antithetical to the ideals of classical conservatism than contemporary Republicanism.
To the average contemporary Republican, nothing is sacred but sexuality, American military force, or the personhood of corporations. The environment, the broad middle class, and the well-evolved developmental norms of pre-sprawl communities are unworthy of conservation. In an earlier iteration, I would have had an inkling of cause to agree: Nothing was sacred, after all.
On this matter, my metaphysics haven’t changed one bit. The universe remains empty of objective meaning, as far as I can conclude. But meaning is the currency around which life has been structured since the dawn of our advanced cortical structures. A healthy, post-partisan social conservatism must rise to this challenge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By instigating the recent shutdown of all non-essential government operations, Republicans in Washington are shooting themselves—or at least their supposedly unshakeable ideology of orthodox small government—in the foot. While statements such as this have become bromidic in current anti-GOP fervor, they are normally tinged with considerable sadism and Schadenfreude. However, the general consensus among the nation’s elite, which (cheerfully) suggests that the intransigence of Republicans in Congress will sour voters on the party as a whole, has little to do with the peril in which small government ideology currently finds itself. This line of reasoning rests upon a faulty account of United States history; in fact, big government advocates with healthier recall skills will find that while the shutdown may have little effect on the fortunes of their favored party, it has the distinct possibility to lead to the continuous expansion of government for the decade to come.
Prior to the shutdown, the notion of small government had been doing pretty well in America. Sequestration, despite being criticized by both parties, had been doing a fine job curtailing runaway government spending. While President Obama won reelection, Republicans maintained their significant majority in the House of Representatives. Intrusive gun control legislation has repeatedly failed in Congress, and a libertarian in the Paul political family is finally earning nationwide respect and support. Yet, unwilling to win several battles now or to postpone eventual victory in the war, Congressional Republicans have embarked on the quixotic mission to defund, and hopefully repeal, Obamacare. This has led, somewhat improbably, to the current impasse in D.C. Congressional Republicans successfully orchestrated the shutdown of the government, although their ultimate goals remain unclear to everyone involved.
Wistful Democrats rejoice at the implications the standoff has for what they see as a truculently disagreeable political party. After all, poll numbers show that the American people are blaming Republicans for the shutdown. Combine this with conventional wisdom surrounding the 1995 government shutdown, when Newt Gingrich’s poll numbers sunk to a level now-Senator Al Franken ’73 quipped as “only four points higher than the Unabomber,” and the future of the Republican Party seems dead on arrival. And in the last presidential election immediately following a government shutdown, a Clinton won by a landslide—an auspicious omen for Democrats looking ahead to Hillary’s chances in 2016.
However, reports of the death of the Republican Party are highly exaggerated. While Senator Ted Cruz is incorrect in believing the government shutdown good for his political ideology, he is not wrong in saying, “The sort of cocktail chatter wisdom in Washington that, ‘Oh, the [1995-96] shutdown was a political disaster for Republicans,’ is not borne out by the data.” That logic is borne out by facts: While Republicans’, like Speaker Gingrich’s, poll numbers may have tanked, the electoral results in 1996 were inconsequential. Despite Clinton’s easy victory at the presidential level, the GOP managed to pick up two Senate seats, all the while holding on to all but two seats in the House. To put even more perspective on matters, current backlash against the Republican Party pales in comparison to the high disfavor of the party in 1995.
When it was all said and done, there was actually very little political fallout for the Republican Party as a result of the mid-90s shutdown. Gingrich retained his speakership until the end of the decade, when he handed power to fellow Republican Dennis Hastert (whose eponymous Hastert Rule is one reason the House of Representatives has yet to vote on a continuing resolution for the budget), and control of the White House passed from Bill Clinton to George W. Bush. With the exception of 2001-2002, in which Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords switched caucuses mid-term in order to give the Democrats a majority in the Senate, the GOP held control of both chambers of Congress until the 2006 blue wave knocked it out of power in the legislative branch.
Although the political consequences of a shutdown have historically been non-negative—if not immediately positive—for the uncompromising party, that does not mean the future of small government conservatism is bright. While there is no evidence to suggest that the Republican Party itself will suffer permanently from the current situation, its political ideology might not be so lucky. One need only consider the 1994 Republican Revolution, which rode into Washington insisting on slashing big government agencies and getting rid of burdensome entitlements. It held these positions in its Contract With America, promising to reform Medicare and Social Security, get the government out of student loans, and, first and foremost, balance the budget.
By the time the 12-year majority of Gingrich-era Republicans had come to a close the limited government ideas espoused in the Contract With America had become a sham. Bush and the GOP Congress of the aughts took the nation’s finances in the wrong direction, notably with the $1.2 trillion Medicare prescription drug benefit and two costly wars. Out were the days in which the GOP expressed their devotion to Goldwater’s limited government manifesto “Conscience of a Conservative.” In were the days the of turning that into the big government credo of “compassionate conservatism.”
Republicans must be careful not to head down this road again. Fearing constituents and desiring victories, high-paid political consultants will tell the party that they need to moderate in order to be successful. Obviously, in some aspects—notably tactics and strategy—they do. But when it comes to their beliefs in a small government, they’d best not listen. Maybe they should stop trying to block the implementation of Obamacare. But, for the country’s sake, the near future should not be marked by a Republican Party that supports programs like it for political reasons.

On Tuesday, almost all of Boston’s school bus drivers went on strike, walking off their jobs in protest of, among other things, what they called unaddressed complaints about their union contract.
The workers cited many complaints about Veolia, the multinational transportation corporation which the City of Boston recently contracted to manage the Boston Public School buses. School bus drivers have long been represented by a contract with United Steelworkers. The union has filed complaints with the National Labor Relations Board that Veolia has not followed the union contract with respect to benefits and payroll procedures, and has also instituted other policies that make bus drivers’ jobs more difficult. Workers say that the government shutdown last week, which shut the NLRB and indefinitely delayed the union’s legal grievances, was the impetus for Tuesday’s walkout.
We do not want to comment on the workers’ grievances or whether the strike was justified—those concerns are better addressed by union members and managers who know more about the situation. However, we are very concerned that this strike was carried out with an egregious lack of concern for its impact on students and parents.
Workers go on strike when they don’t feel their demands are being met by less drastic means. To be sure, actions are more effective when they disrupt business as usual. Nonetheless, the manner in which this strike was carried out caused great harm to the community. Because the strike was unannounced, no parents had warning that school buses wouldn’t be coming, causing stress and worry. Many families struggled to send their children to school, and 16 percent of students didn’t come to school at all—three times the number of absences on an average school day. Moreover, the inconvenience of either finding alternative transportation to school or staying home with stranded children disproportionately affects working-class and poor families. Parents with cars, stay-at-home parents, or parents who can simply call in late to their jobs can more easily transport their children to school via other means. But families with only one parent or in which both parents work, and families that live in Boston’s lower-income communities underserved by public transportation, faced the brunt of stress and disruption last Tuesday.
Many of the strike’s detrimental effects to the city of Boston could have been avoided by informing community members of the strike beforehand, or, better yet, working with parents, students, and teachers to organize an action that had the support of the community before it took place.
The union that represents Boston’s school bus drivers, United Steelworkers, did not sanction this strike; in fact, union officials were some of the first to call for striking drivers to get back to work. This wildcat strike cost the city of Boston tens of thousands of dollars, as well as untold hardship for local families. If the drivers’ grievances are legitimate, then they should seek recourse with their union through legally sanctioned means.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a five-part series on Cambridge City Council election issues. Read each installment on the Fridays leading up to the Nov. 5 election. Part I ran on Oct. 4 and Part III ran on Oct. 18.
Less than six months ago, Cambridge’s bustle was replaced by a silence punctuated only by police sirens, as the city shut down to hunt two of its own: Dzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged perpetrators of the Boston Marathon bombings.
With the Cambridge City Council election just less than four weeks away, candidates reflected in interviews with Crimson reporters last week on how this tragedy has affected Cambridge’s character and what can be done to address the issues of safety and crime brought to light by these events.
The incident revealed that as city councillors, candidates may have to address not just street surveillance and the management of everyday criminal acts in Cambridge but even terrorism prevention.
“This has been a really reflective time, these past six months,” said candidate Jefferson R. Smith. “[The bombings] occurred right across the river, but it was really in our own front yard in terms of the people that perpetrated the crime.”
CLOSE TO HOME
While the rest of the nation struggled to comprehend how two people could commit such an act as the bombings, Cambridge residents also tried to understand how those same people could have lived as neighbors without giving any indication of their intentions.
“Those two brothers came here from the former USSR and somehow felt alienated and turned against the system,” said City Council candidate James Lee.
Candidate Lesley R. Phillips, who lives with her partner close to Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, where the Tsarnaev brothers attended high school, remarked that she had “probably parked in front of the Tsarnaev household more than a dozen times.”
“They were students at Rindge and Latin,” Phillips said. “I’m sure that we crossed paths more than once.”
Yet candidates expressed uncertainty about the possibility of formulating a standardized response policy to what they deemed an extreme occurrence.
“This was a one-shot incident,” said candidate Gary W. Mello. “I don't think there was anything that any specific policy [could do] that would have prevented it.”
Phillips said that the two perpetrators never stood out as potential criminals. “Every report that I’ve heard is that both these fellows were unremarkable in their high school records and interactions, that the Department of Education, the police, and everybody else who looked into it did not miss any clues because there were no clues to pick up on,” she said.
Candidate Luis Vasquez agreed that not much could have been done in the way of prevention.
“They flew under our radar and there's nothing that a police officer [could do] to stop all the planning behind that,” Vasquez said.
CONSTANT VIGILANCE
Instead, many of the candidates underscored the need for an institutionalized response system for everyday criminal activity.
While crime in Cambridge overall has dropped by nine percent compared to last year, Cambridge has seen a jump in violent crime this semester to the tune of an 18 percent increase from last month, according to a report by the Cambridge Police Department.
City council candidates stressed that they believed most of the violent crimes taking place in Cambridge lacked a pattern and as such are more difficult to control.
“Isolated incidents are hard to deal with except on a case-by-case basis. It's easy if the same street corner is producing assaults, but that’s not the way it works,” Mello said. “They’re almost random—you are not seeing them on a regular basis in a regular place—so how are the cops going to deal with that?”
Still, several candidates said that Cambridge needs stronger policing, conducted by both law enforcement officers and the community in general. Candidate Dennis Benzan, for example, said that he would welcome the establishment of a new Cambridge Police Department station in Harvard Square or Central Square.
“We have to keep increasing police presence,” Benzan said. “People feel afraid even in Cambridge.”
Candidate James M. Williamson also suggested incentivizing collaboration between police and residents to reduce crime rates.
Even as candidates offered recommendations for reducing crime, several said that Cambridge is already significantly safer than its peer cities.
“There is no neighborhood in which I hesitate to walk,” said candidate Elie Yarden.
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE
For candidate Dennis Carlone, improving safety infrastructure should begin with the more isolated areas of the city, which he said are loci for crime. One of those places for Carlone was the Christian Science Center in Boston, where he said that he was robbed and mugged on one of his first trips to New England. At the time, Carlone was a New York resident.
“The difference in Manhattan [was that] there were many people around,” he said. “When I was mugged there was nobody there.”
In order to reduce such isolated incidents, some candidates suggested improving public transportation hours and routes in Cambridge. Phillips said she thinks running public transportation all night and “criss-cross[ing]” routes across the city could prevent opportunistic crime, for example.
“Cambridge Street is busy all night long. It’s a very safe street to be on,” she said. “Broadway isn’t.”
In response to repeated stabbings that have occurred at John F. Kennedy Park in the past two months, Carlone stressed the importance of increasing foot traffic by incentivizing activity at night. “JFK Park is bordered by some housing, but you also have the John F. Kennedy School, which can go dormant,” he said. “I think good urban design can lessen problems because you want activity.”
Many of the candidates addressed the debate about the installation of more closed-circuit security cameras throughout Cambridge—a discussion reinvigorated, some said, by the Marathon bombings.
First installed by the Department of Homeland Security in 2008, Cambridge’s network of surveillance cameras monitors eight locations throughout the city.
“The fact that they’ve just come back to life, back to public discourse, is clearly a response to the April tragedy,” said Phillips, although she cautioned that turning on security cameras “brings up a lot of horrible red flags.”
Other candidates expressed limited support for increased surveillance, provided the public had a say in the process. “If we are going to install cameras in our neighborhoods, we need more input from the public,” said Benzan.
EVERYDAY CHANGES
Some candidates pointed to improving small aspects of city life, from cleanliness to traffic control, as a viable means of reducing the crime rate.
“There's a broken window effect where clean streets and lack of construction and all of this stuff has an impact on the degree of crime,” said candidate Nadeem Mazen, adding that “just keeping the city clean” could help reduce illegal activity.
Candidate Mushtaque Mirza related his own experience being hit by a car while crossing the street to emphasize the importance of preventing traffic law violations. And Carlone suggested the addition of more cameras at traffic lights to reduce drivers going through red lights.
These little changes complement a subtle shift in the way Cantabrigians view safety after the Marathon bombings and their aftermath.
“It’s affected people’s mentality,” Smith said. “When they have larger gatherings, they expect that they’ll see a larger police presence, and I think that’s perfectly okay.”
Still, candidates stressed the strength city residents have shown in response to tragedy and cautioned against taking reactionary policies too far.
“Bad things happen,” Mazen said. “We can organize against them. We do organize against them and our responses are effective.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School has begun developing an online learning initiative, called HBX, following in the footsteps of its peer institutions, according to a BloombergBusinessweek report. In the past year, the program has picked up steam with the hiring of new staff and the promotion of Business School employees to positions in HBX.
Following the Bloomberg report, the school has released few details regarding the courses being developed and the cost of the program. However, the initiative has been in the works since at least June when Jana Kierstead, an HBS administrator, noted in her LinkedIn profile that she had been named executive director of HBX. Her new position is also reflected in Harvard’s online directory.
The new information comes more than a year after the launch of edX, the online learning platform announced by Harvard and MIT in May 2012. The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School announced online course offerings in the past few months. Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny told The Chronicle of Higher Education that the school had not decided whether to join the edX platform.
Kenny also told The Chronicle that the Business School will face the challenge of translating its case method style onto an online platform given the heavy focus on faculty and student interaction.
The Business School has been looking to hire additional staff members to support the initiative, including a “Director of Academic Content Development.” A listing for an opening for the position appeared on the site Higher Ed Jobs last week.
The listing states that the Business School wants to use HBX to become the top provider of business education online using the school’s reputation, impact, faculty, and other resources. The position entails working closely with faculty to create content including interactive elements and mini simulations, suggestive of a diverse platform offering.
Prominent Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen addressed online education at the World Business Forum in New York City earlier this month, according to Business Insider. He described online education as an example of a disruptive innovation, a term he coined that describes a new innovation or market that goes on to interfere with an existing one and ultimately allows a better product to emerge.
“An innovation that is disruptive allows a whole new population of consumers at the bottom of a market access to a product or service that was historically only accessible to consumers with a lot of money or a lot of skill,” he wrote on his website.
“It truly isn’t as good, but does this technology, over time, get good enough to meet the needs of our customers? The answer is yes,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lisa M. Boes, resident dean of Pforzheimer House, will leave the College this fall for Brandeis University, where she will serve as dean of academic services starting in November. Boes has been Pfoho’s resident dean since 2007.
“She is excited about the opportunity to lead a collection of advising and student support programs at a small liberal arts institution with clear social justice mission,” Co-House Masters Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant wrote in an email to the Pfoho community last week. “It is a wonderful opportunity for her, but we will miss her sorely.”
Gabriel A. Katsh ’04, a Pfoho resident tutor, will be stepping in as Pfoho’s interim resident dean until the end of the school year.
Although Boes will no longer be affiliated with Pfoho, she said she will continue to work at the Graduate School of Education following her departure from the College. Boes also directed Wintersession—an optional week of activities for undergraduates during the last week of the winter recess—and will continue her work with the program as the College searches for a replacement.
Reflecting on her time in Pfoho, Boes said that her work with students and tutors in the House has prepared her for her upcoming role at Brandeis.
“I’ve had this really amazing breadth [of work], but with a small scale, and now I get to take what I’ve learned from that breadth and apply it to a bigger scale, but with a really clear focus,” Boes said in an interview in her Pfoho office on Thursday.
In an email to The Crimson, Harrington wrote that Boes was an “invaluable support and guide” to her and her husband as they transitioned into their new roles as House Masters. Appointed in the spring, Harrington and Durant have just begun their first semester living in the House.
“We both admired, not only her deep knowledge of the ways of the House, the needs of the students, and the workings of the College, but the mix of common sense, good judgment, and unflagging capacity for caring that she brought to the advising and pastoral side of her work with students,” Harrington wrote.
Pfoho residents who have interacted with Boes say they will miss her when she departs from the College. Blake Zenuni ’14 said Boes has “been a huge, huge help” to him throughout his time at Harvard.  “I feel if it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t have overcome the large obstacles I faced at Harvard and outside Harvard,” Zenuni said.
Harrington said she hopes Boes will continue to stay in touch with the Pfoho community.
“She has been a treasured member of the Pfoho community, and we hope that she will stay connected to our House and to all of us in the years to come, even as she moves forward into a new and exciting chapter at Brandeis University,” Harrington wrote to The Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Nearly two weeks after Cambridge police asked Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison to help them respond to disturbances at several final clubs, Ellison said in an interview on Thursday that his role in such incidents is not to discipline students, but rather to prevent further harm.
 
“If a student gets arrested, it comes to my office,” said Ellison, a former police officer who is charged with overseeing the College’s disciplinary proceedings. “But if we could do things to prevent that from happening, so that we don’t even have an Ad Board case or an arrest, that to me is part of my job.”
On the night of Saturday, Sept. 28, police officers from both the Cambridge Police Department and the Harvard University Police Department responded to complaints lodged against several final clubs, including the Owl and the Spee, according to a CPD police report. One Harvard student and a student from another school were arrested for violating open-container laws, and when police encountered resistance from other partygoers, they notified Ellison, who later arrived at the scene.
Ellison said the Sept. 28 incident represented the only time this academic year he has intervened in a social disturbance by students at the behest of police. He said that police called asking for his assistance with a similar situation just once last academic year, but that in that case he chose not to come to the scene.
Ellison said his purview in these rare interventions is not limited to final clubs, clarifying in an email Thursday that he “would go to any location where the authorities asked for my presence or assistance.”
He said he would intervene at a dorm party if CPD or HUPD officers could not first get in touch with the tutor-on-call or the resident dean, but he said that “rarely, rarely happens.” Ellison said he would even consider making an appearance at an off-campus apartment if police requested his presence and “the population that was there was all our students.” However, he said it would be “unlikely” for him to appear at a disturbance in a restaurant or a bar, since many of the people involved would probably not be Harvard affiliates.
According to Ellison, this ability to enforce the College’s rules off-campus stems from the Harvard College Handbook for Students, which states that the College expects that “all students, whether or not they are on campus or are currently enrolled as degree candidates, will behave in a mature and responsible manner.”
In all such cases, Ellison said, “I’m really trying to help intervene in a way that’s positive for the student so that we don’t have to have an Ad Board case.”
Ellison emphasized that while the administration cannot regulate final clubs directly, College rules still apply to individual club members and partygoers.
“When I go there, I’m not going there assuming that they’re doing something wrong, I’m assuming that they’re our students and that they’re part of our community,” he said, noting that he and other administrators meet with final club leadership each year. “If in that moment, something happens and there is a violation, obviously I would respond to it as an officer of the University.”
When asked why police choose to call Ellison about student social disturbances, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email Thursday night that “HUPD notifies College and/or University officials of significant incident involving students, faculty, and staff.”
CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello did not respond to a request for comment on this article. The presidents of the Owl Club and the Spee Club also did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a faculty-led conversation about academic integrity on Thursday afternoon, more than 70 administrators, students, and members of the faculty gathered and discussed campus academic and extracurricular culture and how to best encourage academic honesty at Harvard.
The event, which featured a panel of faculty members and administrators including Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and Co-Master of Cabot House Rakesh Khurana, is one of a series of discussions being held at the College on academic integrity issues. Previously, administrators solicited feedback in the Houses following a proposal in April of what would be Harvard’s first-ever honor code.
At the discussion Thursday, students and faculty raised several concerns about campus attitudes surrounding academic honesty, and panelists offered their own perspectives on the issue.
Addressing the attendees, Pfister talked about the consequences of cheating and put integrity in a larger context. “We would probably all admit that cheating can be pretty widespread,” he said.
Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, an Undergraduate Council representative from Lowell House, commented on the admissions process, noting that he did not have to write about integrity on his application.
Other attendees suggested that more small classes might better foster student-faculty relationships and thereby encourage students to adhere to standards of academic honesty. Attendees also discussed the impact of pass/fail classes and whether or not it would be helpful to require students to take a certain number of courses pass/fail.
In an interview after the event, Academic Integrity Committee member Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said he was “very satisfied” with the discussion.
“I think it’s really important that everyone participate in this discussion, and so what I really look forward to is having large turnout and having people from all across the College really partake in this,” said Goffard.
The panel event on Thursday is part of a broader, ongoing discussion about academic integrity at the College, which comes after news of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest cheating case in recent memory, broke last fall. Roughly 125 students were investigated by the Administrative Board after being accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on the course’s final take-home exam.
Amidst this increasing focus on academic integrity issues on campus, several members of the Academic Integrity Committee are working on the first draft of Harvard’s honor code, with a goal of completing a draft of the policy by the start of November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Congress still at an impasse over a deal that would end the government shutdown and extend the nation’s debt limit before the looming Oct. 17 deadline, several undergraduates said the recent government instability has affected, for better or for worse, their interest in pursuing careers in government.
“I’m thinking about whether working for the government is working for an effective institution anymore,” said Benjamin J. Hughes ’14, who is considering a job on Capitol Hill or at a federal agency after graduation. “It seems like it’s really hard to get things done in Washington right now, so as somebody who’s looking to get stuff done, it doesn’t seem like that’s as attractive an option as before.” 
Kent W. Toland ’14 said that several governmental stalemates over the past few years have soured him on the prospect of pursuing a career in federal government, an industry which he thinks has been made ineffective by extreme discord.
“I’ve had thoughts on these things before the shutdown, and this has very strongly confirmed that,” Toland said. “Just from my perspective, it really makes me much more likely to pursue a career in state government.” 
On a broader scale, however, Office of Career Services Director Robin Mount wrote in an email it is “too early” to evaluate the impact of the government shutdown on students’ long-term career plans. If the recent instability does spur any broader decline in student interest in government work, Mount wrote, the phenomenon will be undetectable until the spring, when seniors typically apply for federal jobs.
Mount noted that an OCS informational session on careers in government scheduled for next Friday has not been altered in light of the shutdown, though the attendance of some governmental office representatives at the meet-up may be affected.
“Some attendees have said they now have more time and are looking forward to attending and others are waiting to see what happens next week with the shutdown to see if they will be able to attend,” Mount wrote.
Mount also expressed optimism that the recent instability will not discourage student interest in working in government.
“At OCS we would encourage students to step up and help to make government better for their generation and the future,” Mount wrote. “Harvard students work hard, are smart and have good ideas so we would encourage them to be part of working towards future solutions.”
To this end, some students interviewed for this article said they see the government’s recent instability as an opportunity to personally step in and make changes themselves.
Kathryn G. Walsh ’14, a former intern at the U.S. Small Business Administration, said she still plans to work as a policy writer or political adviser in Washington D.C. after graduation.
“There are things that need to be fixed and I think I could help fix them,” she said.
Like Walsh, Timothy E. Davis ’16, who aspires to be a politician, said the shutdown has made government “more exciting.”
“Everyone who gets into government wants to begin a career where they have the potential to make a difference and to make a change,” he said.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, chair of the Institute of Politics’s National Campaign, said that while he remains inspired about working in government even in light of the shutdown, the recent instability has prompted him to look internationally for governmental career opportunities. 
“The shutdown hasn’t affected my general perception of government and why I would want to engage in public service,” said Goffard, who hopes to work for the United Nations. “What it has done has made me rethink if I want to work in American government or some other aspect of government and public service that’s not as susceptible to politicking.”

After finishing tied for sixth at the Golfweek Conference Challenge in Vail, the Harvard women’s golf team hopes that returning to closer fairways at this weekend’s Harvard Invitational will lead it back to the top of the podium. But for the defending Ivy champions, the journey to the eighteenth championship is just as important as the finish itself.
“Our team focuses on the process of reaching our goal, which means not focusing so much on the result and more about how to make things happen,” freshman standout Anne Cheng said. “As a team we practice on key points, constantly focusing on these and we keep working on it until we get it right.”
Junior Tiffany Lim echoed her teammate’s valuing of process over the final result.
“[Coach Rhoads] is very much about emphasizing process and the idea of going through and inputting the right sensory signals that [we] want into [our] own game,” Lim said. “Then regardless of what the outcome is, we continue to input those right signals. Our goal is to not be affected by the outcome.”
The process seems to be working, as the outcomes have been positive thus far. The Crimson opened the year with a 12-stroke victory at the Princeton Invitational at the Springdale Golf Club, which included host Princeton, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania in the field.
The following week Harvard teed off against tougher opponents at the Golfweek Conference Challenge, whose organizers invited the conference leaders from 18 leagues to compete on the Red Sky Golf Course. Faced with unfavorable weather conditions and a general unfamiliarity with the course, the Crimson saw its scores rise and final position drop, though its team score improved with each round.
“[The Golfweek Conference Challenge] was a bigger and stronger tournament for us,” Lim said. “Even though we didn’t play as well as we did at Princeton, I thought we also still played well as a team.“
This weekend, the team will face a much smaller scale of competition than at the Golfweek Conference Challenge. Only five teams other than Harvard will be in the field.
The Crimson looks to Cheng in particular to continue her strong early season play. She finished her first collegiate tournament tied for fourth and currently leads the team in scoring average (74.17) and par four scoring (4.15). The upcoming weekend is the next test of her limited experience and an opportunity for her to earn a third straight top ten finish.
“I’ve been trying to keep as best a focus as I can and not try to get myself overwhelmed with too many things that I have to work on in my game,” Cheng said. “So I focus on one or two small things and practice it for a few weeks to help improve my overall game.”
Though this weekend’s Harvard Invitational is technically a home tournament, Harvard has only practiced at The Bay Course for the past week. But for Crimson golfers with more years of experience, the Harvard Invitational is synonymous with strong finishes.
Senior team captain Bonnie Hu finished second at the Harvard Invitational her sophomore year, posting an 11-over par 155. This season, Hu finished tied for 14th at 13-over par at the Princeton Invitational on Sept, then shot 80-74-78 (232) at the Golfweek Conference Challenge .
Lim finished third at invitational her freshman year. Harvard did not host the invitational last fall. After carding the lowest single-round competitive score in Crimson history in the first round of the Princeton Invitational and eventually winning the tournament with a 4-under par (212), Tiffany will be looking to find that form again this weekend.
“Performance-wise, I just had some technique changes that I’m making in my swing and I knew that it would be a process and that it’s going to take some time to settle in,” Lim said. “For me to play so well at Princeton was surprising and I took advantage of some good breaks that I got and at Golfweek, I stuck to my goal of trying to improve long-term with my technique.”
Even after posting higher scores at the Golfweek Conference Challenge, Lim leads the team in birdies (23), average first round score (71) and par three scoring (2.88). But once again, the team’s focus is about more than just posting the lowest score.
“Our goal [for this weekend] is to play our own game,” Lim said. “We focus on what we need to do to be better and not worry about the outcome or what other schools are doing,”

After opening conference play with a last-minute loss to Yale last Saturday, 2-1, the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-6-2, 0-1-0 Ivy) is looking to rebound against defending Ivy League champion Cornell (6-2-2, 0-1-0) this Saturday.
The Crimson travel to Ithaca for Saturday’s matchup winless in its last three games, hoping to add to the team’s lone win that came against UMass.
Cornell is also searching for its first conference win of the year. Last week, the Big Red fell to Penn, 1-0, in Philadelphia, ultimately done in by a Quaker goal in the 81st minute.
The Big Red got the best of Harvard in last year’s matchup in Cambridge, 3-1, en route to the Ivy League title.  Cornell is striving for a similar result on Saturday, looking to deny the Crimson its first conference win since the 2010 season.
“Every year Cornell brings a very gritty, very hardworking, high pressure team,” senior co-captain Kevin Harrington said. “Last year we couldn’t deal with their pressure and lost the ball in transition.”
Harvard looked poised to notch their fist conference win this past Saturday, taking a 1-0 lead into the 87th minute against Yale. But the Bulldogs scored two goals in the last three minutes to shock the Crimson.
“It was a heartbreaking loss,” Harrington said. “[Definitely] the most devastating loss I’ve ever been a part of.”
Harvard has struggled on offense this season, averaging less than a goal per game. No member of the Crimson squad has scored more than once this season.
“We have to continue to keep better possession in the attacking half,” head coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We [need to] try to get one or two more passes … and be in a good position to finish it.”
A sputtering offense does not bode well for Harvard heading into Saturday. The Big Red defense has been daunting, conceding less than half a goal per game and recording four shutouts, both of which lead the Ancient Eight.
Senior defenseman Ross Friedman has been one of the shining spots this year for the Crimson. He has assisted on four of Harvard’s seven goals during this year’s campaign, including on senior forward A.J. Agha’s lone goal against the Bulldogs.
“Ross works tirelessly,” Lehrer said. “He has a phenomenal will to push the game and fight for every little detail.”
Despite its poor record, the Crimson has had a chance to tie or win almost every game. Harvard has come within a goal in four of its six losses on the season, including Saturday’s last-minute loss in New Haven.
“Our biggest focus going forward…is keeping ourselves mentally engaged,” said Harrington. “That’s why we fell apart [against Yale]. Hopefully we can be more successful when the times get tough.”
Leading the Ancient Eight in corner kicks and shots, Cornell has been able to apply consistent offensive pressure throughout the year. Yet, the Big Red has struggled to finish on offense. Cornell averages only one goal per game, good for seventh in the conference.
However, this year the Crimson will not have to deal with arguably the best player in last year’s matchup, Daniel Haber. The former Ivy League Player of the Year forwent his senior year with the Big Red to play in Cyprus First Division. In his final year with Cornell, Haber amassed 18 goals and seven assists and was nominated for the Mac-Hermann trophy, the highest individual award in NCAA men’s soccer.
This year, a three-pronged attack leads the Cornell attack. Seniors Patrick Slogic and Jake Rinow and junior Conor Goepel have each recorded a team-high two goals on the season. Slogic and Rinow have also added two assists apiece.
“The key for us [against Cornell] will be to be safe with the ball,” Harrington said. “[We can’t] lose possession in dangerous areas.”
Junior defenseman Peter Chodas also looms large as a threat for the Big Red. Chodas won Ivy League Player of the Week co-honors earlier in the year, assisting on a goal in a 2-1 win over Binghamton and providing the lone goal in a 1-0 victory over St. Joseph’s.
Harvard is looking for a spark on offense to overcome Cornell’s superb defense.
The team may look to Harrington and junior Hiroki Kobayashi, who have been the most productive offensive forces for the Crimson so far this year, with six and five shots on goal, respectively.
“We’re creating some very good chances on goal,” Lehrer said. “Sometimes just willing the ball into the goal [off the shin or forehead] is the way that starts to turn things around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last two games, the Cornell defense has given up an average of 40 points, with both ending in a loss. The Harvard football team has, in contrast, put up more than 40 points in all three of its games thus far—all wins.
This Saturday, when the Crimson (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) travels to Schoellkopf Field, it will attempt to extend its unbeaten record to four games and notch its second Ancient Eight win against a struggling Big Red (1-2, 0-1 Ivy) team.
Despite the Crimson’s unblemished record, the team has been plagued by slow starts.
“We just need to really focus and just get into a better rhythm,” coach Tim Murphy said. “There’s just focus and execution, because at the end of the day, if you execute extremely well, you tend to stay on the field longer offensively and get off the field quicker defensively.”
If not for the Crusader quarterback Peter Pujals’s propensity to fumble the ball—four times during the game, with one leading to a defensive touchdown—and last-minute heroics by the offense to tie up the game in the waning seconds of regulation, last week’s contest against Holy Cross might have ended earlier than the three overtime periods it took for Harvard to win.
After sitting on the sideline for much of the game with a hyperextended knee and then being unable to create offense after coming back in during the third quarter, junior quarterback Conner Hempel seemed to find a rhythm in the nick of time.
With three minutes remaining, Hempel kept an 84-yard drive alive by scrambling for a crucial first down before finding double-covered senior tight end Cameron Brate in the back of the end zone for the tying score to take the game to overtime.
“Through the years, I tell my quarterbacks, ‘If nothing’s open, force it to Brate,’” Brate said. “Hempel’s taken it to heart a little bit, but that was a great throw last week, and for whatever reason it landed in my hands.”
Three extra periods later, the Crimson finally emerged with a hard-earned victory, 41-35. A large part of the offense’s success in overtime—and throughout the game, while the quarterback situation remained unclear—was due to running back Paul Stanton Jr. The sophomore tallied 158 total offensive yards and scored two of the three overtime touchdowns.
But with Hempel still uncertain for Saturday due to his knee, according to Brate, the defense will have to step up again in Ithaca. While Harvard has been exceptional at forcing turnovers—racking up 11 over its three games—the passing defense has been spotty at times, most notably in Worcester, where it allowed Pujals to throw for 345 yards, four touchdowns, and no picks.
Pujals, a freshman quarterback who was in just his second career start for Holy Cross, almost certainly would have led his team to a win if Hempel and company had not converted on the final two-minute drive. Despite sacking Pujals six times, the defense was still unable to find a way to stop the freshman until the final drive.
Against Cornell’s Jeff Mathews, the Crimson will look to get more pressure on the quarterback. The senior, who is now the Ivy League’s all-time leading passer, is on multiple award watch lists and is projected to be an NFL draft pick.
“I have no doubt that he’ll be an NFL player,” Murphy said. “[Cornell has] got a good scheme, they’ve got one of the best quarterbacks in the country, and because of that, they’re a streaky, very dangerous team…. It’s one of those games where you never feel like they’re in control.”
Cornell, which hired David Archer to coach the team following last year’s disappointing sixth-place finish, has lost its last two games by at least two scores. One of those came against league rival Yale, which managed to put up 28 points in the second half to pull away from the Big Red.
One week later, Cornell gave up a halftime lead and allowed Colgate to score 24 unanswered points. The Big Red would end up surrendering that contest as well, 41-20.
But in a season where a league win can mean the difference between the championship and second-place, no team can be counted out.
Last season, Princeton, then in first place, having upset conference favorite Harvard and in control of its own destiny, was knocked off the top by none other than Cornell.
“Every Ivy League game is a tough, physical game, so we’re going to have to bring our ‘A’ game,” Brate said. “They’re 1-3 but they’ve played some tough teams to start off the year. They have Jeff Mathews at quarterback, and he’s got an unbelievable arm, so they can really put points on the board. It’ll be a challenge for our defense, and offensively, we just need to execute to our full potential.”

You walk into brain break and survey your options. If you’re faced with the choice between an apple and a brownie, chances are your instincts will guide you towards the brownie; try as we might, we just can’t stop reaching for fat and sugar.
Human evolutionary biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman '86 is an expert on the evolutionary logic behind these patterns. In his newest book, "The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health and Disease," Lieberman tells us about the evolutionary causes and effects of “mismatch diseases,” which occur as a result of long-term changes in our environment but not our bodies. 
We spoke with Lieberman about his book and what it might mean for college students in their day-to-day lives.
According to Lieberman, human beings evolved to become “adapted to eating a diet high in fiber and low in sugar, but craving fat, sugar, and salt.” This diet was suitable to our active lives at a time when our primary activities were making and using tools, hunting, and gathering, Lieberman said.
Now, take a caveman out of his cave and drop him into a college dorm. What happens? 
We’ll give you the bad news first. Our environment today is so significantly different from that of the caveman’s that the caveman would be likely, if he followed his dietary instincts, to suffer from mismatch diseases such as heart disease.
Although we, the caveman’s ancestors, live relatively inactive lives, most of us choose to consume a diet high in sugar and fat. This choice is problematic because it is not balanced out with hunting and gathering activities, Lieberman said.
So what’s the solution to this problem? Since we can’t change our genes, Lieberman told Flyby, we must change our environment.
The good news is, we can do this in three key ways—all of which, thanks to our instincts, are far easier said than done.
First, Lieberman suggested, choose a more healthy diet involving less simple sugar and carbohydrates, which we are adapted to be unable to digest quickly in large amounts. (Real question: does HUDS know this? Because they’re not making it any easier for us).
Second, get physical exercise. (Walking to the Quad doesn’t count).
Third, sleep enough; inadequate sleep creates stress in our bodies. (Unfortunately, having to study for three midterms also creates stress in our bodies and usually means less sleep).
Flyby apologizes if these problems and seemingly unattainable solutions have you feeling even more stressed. Maybe now would be a good time to eat your feelings at brain break.

This Thursday, we learned that the Cabot Science Library and the Science Center Atrium is set to undergo “renovations designed to foster technologically driven teaching and learning” sometime in the vaguely near future. This will be nothing short of a badly-needed facelift for a study space best characterized as Lamont’s ugly stepsister. While the reimagined library will surely include all the expensive touch-screen novelties that “technologically driven teaching” can justify, here are a few of our suggestions for how Harvard could go even further to make the space a happy home for p-setting students.
Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream Bar
We’ve all passed by the Churn2 ice cream stand in the Science Center plaza on our way to Annenberg, where the ice cream is free. Yet even though our wallets advise against it, there is something alluring about ice cream made with not just milk and sugar, but Science. Solution? Harvard acquires proprietorship of Churn2 and sets up a stand permanently in the new Cabot Science Library.
 
Book Checking Scanner
This is a science library. Surely there is some sort of machine we could invent that detects those pesky students trying to steal discrete mathematics journals without making the rest of us unzip three backpack pockets and expose the embarrassing collection of maxi-pads and old granola bar wrappers inhabiting the bottom of our bags.
 
Futuristic Chairs
Like this. Or these. Or even this. Those grody old chairs need to go immediately, and what better to replace them than chairs that look like something 3D-printed from Math 21a course head Oliver Knill’s Mathematica animations? Bonus: statue of John Harvard sitting on one of these chairs, levitated by the Casimir force.
 
Light Sabers
Apparently, Harvard physics professor Mikhail Lukin and MIT physics professor Vladan Vuletić are getting “closer to making…[Star Wars’] iconic lightsaber a reality.” C’mon guys, we know you got them. Hand them over... for science!
