After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you opened The Crimson on December 7, 1996, you would have discovered a news feature about a student trying to find room in his schedule to get to Boston for an HIV test. At that time, Harvard did not offer anonymous HIV testing, so students looking for anonymity while staying in control of their health were sent packing. It’s rare that health care goes backward, but University Health Services’s recent decision to end anonymous testing (instituted in 1996) is one of those times. Effective August 1, only confidential testing will be provided by UHS, meaning that test results will show up on students’ permanent medical records. This change in policy was unnecessary and unjustified and may end up worsening the sexual health of the Harvard community.One reason given by UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 for the removal of anonymous testing was a lack of use. But this trend suggests a much different course of action than elimination of the program. HIV testing is one of the most effective ways of slowing the spread of the virus and signaling to individuals to get medical help. Since testing is not particularly costly or difficult, instead of getting rid of it, UHS should have attempted to increase the use of this testing in an attempt to actively improve the health of its student body. Anonymous testing was instituted in 1996 as a result of months of campaigning by campus AIDS activists. They did this because they knew what Rosenthal seems to have forgotten: that a severe stigma existed—and still exists, albeit to a lesser extent—against HIV-positive persons. In a recent interview with The Crimson, Rosenthal argued that HIV/AIDS is no longer enough of a stigma to justify testing, a sentiment that has not been echoed by Harvard’s AIDS activists. The option for all HIV testing to remain off a person’s permanent medical record must remain.Paging Mr. Rosenthal: 2009 is not that far from 1996. If UHS wants its students to have to search for sites off campus for care, then this is a good first step. The stigma for HIV/AIDS is deeply rooted in our society and abroad, and we shouldn’t decrease students’ willingness to undergo testing, since this is one of the few ways to limit the spread of the disease. Rosenthal noted that in a few years everyone will be getting tested. But not everyone will want it on their record–nor should they have to have it there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I can’t imagine the House functioning without us,” assistant to the Adams House resident dean Otto F. Coontz remarked after hearing about the mandated 25-percent cuts to House budgets that might put his and similar positions at risk. His concern is warranted. A strong House life and academic support network are essential components of the Harvard undergraduate experience, helping to foster for students an environment of both intellectual and personal growth. FAS should not be making budget cuts that seriously endanger this core element of undergraduate life. Rather, the burgeoning administration, which has seen a staggering expansion in recent years, must take a fair share of the budget cuts and look to consolidate. We realize cuts will be felt across the board—but it would be a shame if they weren’t felt at all in the Harvard boardrooms.
Over the past 10 years, FAS has added 230 administrative staffers to its payroll, while Houses have kept their staff size steady over the same time period. Central administrators thus need to look inward for cuts. The administration’s main role should be to support the faculty and students here in pursuing their educational and developmental goals. The administration should find savings at its own expense before endangering areas that have a direct and serious effect on the lives of students—like academics and House life. Specifically, given its recent rapid growth, the administration must strongly consider salary cuts and firings as a cost-saving and efficiency measure.
Most importantly, the academic mission of the College should be its priority during budget cut season. The news that section sizes will increase next year as fewer TFs are hired is disconcerting to every Harvard student who knows that much of the learning at Harvard takes place in section. This personalized learning environment of a section is lost when students become just another head in the crowd. An 18-student section is already too large to allow for desired personal attention and opportunities for discussion, and thus 18 should certainly not be the lower limit on section sizes. As a possible remedy to these cuts, professors should look into teaching or attending sections to supplement the experience, as a few excellent teachers already do.
The assistant position to the Allston Burr resident dean, which currently exists for each of the 12 Houses, is also in jeopardy. According to House administrators, plans exist to scale back this position into a 10-month job or to consolidate the office so that one assistant provides support to multiple Houses. This assistant provides counseling and advising services, sends letters of recommendations to graduate programs for students, and maintains House alumni files. A scaling back of these services would certainly have a large impact on students and their Housing experience.
Administrative consolidations could offset such severe cuts to House life, which are worrisome and misguided and will cause major problems for both the House staff and students. This is not to say that the specific proposals above are entirely unjustifiable—simply that the community spirit and nurturing environment created by House life, should not be lost to budget cuts—especially if these cuts are meant to spare the bureaucratic central administration’s jobs and salaries.
When administrators move to the next round of cuts and speak of “department reshaping,” they must remember that academic life is the essential purpose of a university, and cuts that damage the educational experience should be made as a last resort only, especially when there is an expensive administrative personnel budget that has not yet been touched. Preserving faculty and course offerings in order to preserve the student experience should be our top priority. The administration is undoubtedly extremely important to the functioning of this school, but as a priority it is not on par with the faculty—as seems to be the mindset that has developed.
Many smart budget cuts have been made, including those to unnecessary travel and consulting expenses. Yet, as administrators review these recent cuts and look toward making more in the future, they must ensure that the core functions of both House life and academic life are not seriously harmed. Given the administration’s rapid expansion in recent years, they must look internally for savings, even if this means difficult firings or adjustments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are often thought of as possessing those characteristics that forge prominent careers in politics: leadership, charisma, high intelligence—and a dubious interpretation of honesty.
This last trait has, it seems, even infiltrated student groups with a supposed commitment to charity. Thanks to the lofty claims these organizations parade on posters, purchasers are led to believe that all proceeds from the highly priced tickets are donated. However, with an interpretation of honesty that Bill Clinton would be proud of, there are often no actual profits—and consequently, no donations. To market an event based on the assumption of charity and then fail to give away a cent is the peak of hypocrisy. Equally reprehensible is the tacit acceptance suggested by the administration’s failure to enforce these organizations’ promises. Commitments to charity must be genuine, not merely a form of image marketing. If student groups advertise a charitable cause, they should be forced to pay up.
The history of the annual Eleganza fashion show exemplifies the moral waffling many student groups demonstrate. According to a 2009 executive producer, Eleganza failed to actually donate to charity for several years, despite fundraising promises to give 100 percent of proceeds to The Center for Teen Empowerment. A 2009 executive producer acknowledged past lapses with the explanation, “We’re a student organization…we have a budget the same size as Yardfest but without any support from Harvard.” Such excuses over mismanagement are inadequate; Harvard event organizers unable to manage basic business procedures would do well to hand over management to someone who’s taken Ec 10. It’s easier to believe in financial incompetence than the alternative, however, student organizers who are aware that an event may not make a profit and still advertise a charity function demonstrate insincerity and a blatant disregard for their chosen cause.
As much as student groups who subscribe to this practice have a warped view of morality, the administration is also at fault for not enforcing appropriate standards. While Eleganza is an extreme case of failed donations and was eventually reprimanded after 13 years of misleading advertising, no firm regulations prevent the general practice. Nor has the administration ever attempted to raise awareness about the existence of false donation promises, an act that would increase public scrutiny and prevent organizers’ abilities to make false promises. The administration’s nonchalant attitude toward imaginative interpretations of the term “charity event” is unacceptable, and it is its duty to apply firmer rules and enforce greater transparency about donation practices.
This can be achieved through the simple demand that any claim to “donate all profits” must be followed with an actual donation—if need be, from the organization’s own pocket. Student groups could also follow Eleganza’s more recent example; for the past two years, organizers with a clearly different outlook from previous years have set aside a concrete donation as an event cost. Furthermore, student groups that advertise an intention to donate should also publicly announce the amount eventually given. Such policies would allow students to make accurate evaluations when considering the high price of “charitable” event tickets.
Eleganza is an impressive event in its own right, and, although the organizers’ current outlook is commendable, its past false dedication to charity is less worthy of admiration. Similarly, the absence of concrete regulations to prevent abuse of the term “donating all profits” suggests that responsibility for the lack of attention awarded charitable donations extends beyond student groups to University Hall itself. The Office of Student Life and student groups themselves must work to end this lamentable practice—Harvard may be a breeding ground for future politicians, but students should resist embracing the devious persona quite so wholeheartedly.Olivia M. Goldhill ’11, a Crimson editorial writer, is a government concentrator in Pforzheimer House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the Harvard Republican Club released the results of its college-wide student poll—on the question of official recognition for the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps—in an e-mail that capped off a weeklong campaign on the issue. The results broke down the percentage of respondents “in favor” and “opposed” to official recognition, based on the number of students who had answered “yes,” “no,” or “I’m not sure” to a single question that made no reference to the crucial controversy over the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that prohibits openly gay individuals from joining the military.
One of the main objectives of ROTC members and their supporters on campus has been to divorce opposition to DADT from opposition to ROTC, the military, and its members. However, by drawing a line between “supporters” and “opponents” of ROTC over the issue of official recognition, the HRC poll conflates the large number of ROTC supporters concerned about discrimination on campus with a small minority of staunch military opponents, much to the detriment of an open and productive dialogue. 
The poll could easily have distinguished between absolute opposition to ROTC’s official recognition and principled conditional support by adding a fourth option: “Yes, I support official recognition, but only after the repeal of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell.” But the question and available responses were likely framed under the false assumption that no such distinction exists. Shortly before the poll’s release, Caleb L. Weatherl ’10, president emeritus of the HRC, denied the claim that DADT constituted legitimate grounds for Harvard’s refusal to officially recognize ROTC. Such a stance, Weatherl argued, would be “intellectually inconsistent” because neither ROTC nor the military was responsible for instituting or overturning ROTC. 
Weatherl’s emphasis that DADT is the product of a congressional act rather than a ROTC-specific decision is useful in informing the misinformed. But wielding that fact as evidence of Harvard’s “intellectual inconsistency” unfairly ignores the logic behind Harvard’s position and suggests that it must stem from antagonism against ROTC and its members. 
The points at the heart of the debate over recognition are worth clarifying. Regardless of whether ROTC deserves recognition on the merits of its mission alone, the program continues to enforce the inherently discriminatory DADT policy. As such, pending changes to federal law, Harvard cannot officially recognize ROTC because the program enforces a policy irreconcilable with Harvard’s nondiscrimination policy. The university’s position in no way rests on a claim about who is responsible for the policy. Rather, it is the direct consequence of the reality that the “current federal policy of excluding known lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals from admission to ROTC or of discharging them from  service is inconsistent with Harvard’s values as stated in its policy on discrimination.” 
Indeed, Harvard does not (and should not) hold the military, ROTC, or individual cadets and midshipmen responsible for the policy by including this statement in its handbook for current and prospective students. And in no way does the statement imply that students who make the decision to participate in ROTC are themselves acting in opposition to Harvard’s values. 
Having made these arguments, it would be wrong to claim that there is a satisfactory status quo for ROTC at Harvard. While the aforementioned poll has stirred up a great deal of controversy (not limited to our campus), the recent HRC campaign has contributed productively to the debate over official recognition by bringing to light the struggles and concerns expressed by ROTC members on campus. If cadets and midshipmen feel “unwelcome” or even “degraded,” as Weatherl writes, by the atmosphere at Harvard—even to the extent that they feel uncomfortable wearing their uniforms to class—then there is indeed a deep moral failure here. 
But it would be a mistake to blame the university’s position on official recognition for this disgraceful fact. Indeed, the responsibility for the cool reception of ROTC cadets on our campus extends far beyond even the symbolic reach of cross-registration fees and student-handbook disclaimers to the words and actions of every member of the Harvard community. As such, while we cannot sweep these cadets’ concerns to the side by claiming a principled stance, neither can we simply ignore the deep injustice of a policy that excludes and discharges individuals for speaking a truth about themselves. 
There are principles at stake here that seem too basic to repeat. Every student should feel welcome at Harvard. Every student should feel supported in pursuing something she believes in. But until Congress repeals the discriminatory policies of the Clinton era, the university cannot and should not extend official recognition to ROTC. If the Obama administration dismantles this disgraceful legacy of the past, then University Hall should not hesitate to support the ROTC program just as it does any of the other numerous student organizations on campus. As for me, I personally fully support all the midshipmen and cadets here on campus and eagerly await the day when DADT is repealed and Harvard once again gives official recognition to ROTC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barricaded in their rooms by police caution tape, students in Kirkland House did not know how to react in the stressful aftermath of Monday afternoon’s shooting. Three types of uniforms—Harvard, Cambridge, and state police—quickly flooded the area, but they provided no information. Until an hour later, the much-publicized University Emergency Communication system was mum; the House master did not contact the residents until 5:32 PM, and the only community-wide e-mail we all received was from Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds dealing with, of all things, the shuttle service. Tired of waiting afraid in her Kirkland room, Sarah A. Sherman ’09 opened her window and asked a police officer in the courtyard what was going on. He replied succinctly: “Read about it in the newspapers.”
What happened on Monday was a tragedy; we should all mourn the loss of 21-year-old Justin Cosby, who died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital of the gunshot wound he received in the basement of Kirkland’s J entryway. Yet it is quite telling that Sherman received that sort of reply from a police officer. Proper communication is part of protection—and on Monday, the university utterly failed in that regard. Most worrisome, this is indicative of a larger trend in the way the administration has been interacting with the student body lately.
Students in the vicinity of Kirkland who heard the gunshots on Monday afternoon freaked out—and understandably so. Most of them stayed indoors and rushed to contact friends and e-mail lists about the shooting. From the Black Students Association to the Harvard Salient, rumors of the shooting spread like wildfire. Some e-mails claimed the shooting had happened outside of the Bee Club, others that more than one person had been seen collapsing from gunshot wounds on Mt. Auburn Street. Predictably, there was more misinformation than information. 
But we were supposed to be ready for this. According to its website, the University Operations Center manages the Harvard University Emergency Notification System, a “high speed notification system” to alert people of emergencies. To complement that, several e-mails in the last year have encouraged us to sign up for text-message alerts from the Harvard University Emergency Management Plan, supposedly to “facilitate rapid and effective communication should there be an extreme emergency on campus.” And, to top it all off, we have the Harvard University Police Department community-advisory e-mails, for crimes that “may pose a continuing public safety threat.” 
Despite the avalanche of acronyms, when an emergency materialized on Monday, chaos and fear spread through e-mail lists for an hour while all the above systems remained silent. The Kirkland master’s e-mail to his House residents beat the university’s “emergency” text message by almost 15 minutes. Most tellingly, when the first text message finally arrived at 5:45 p.m., it was both factually inaccurate and truncated: “Report of shooting near Kirkland House on Mt Auburn St. Police ask people to remain indoors and avoi [sic].” In the era of Twitter, it seems little to ask that those in charge of emergency SMS should know the number of characters that fit in one message. For the record, it is 160.
A second message 20 minutes later brought more truncation, urging students in the area to “await furt [sic]”. An hour later, a third SMS took a different approach—speculation: “HUPD believes assailants have left the area and says that it is safe to resume normal activities.” Needless to say, that half-baked sign of reassurance did not calm many. But at least it was not a cut-off warning.
It would be unfair to say that we received no email from the administration during this stressful time. Dean Hammonds emailed the College community at 5:10 p.m. to address the complaints against the proposed cuts to the shuttle service.  In her message, she wrote that “I would be remiss if I did not also point out that there is more to campus safety than shuttle service, and the College has worked diligently over the last five years to increase students’ safety on campus.” Then she went on to talk about blue-light phones, designated safe pathways, and the escort service—services that hardly anyone uses. Despite the promise to look into reversing some cuts, no commitments were made.
The police response to the shooting seemed prompt and adequate, so the main shortcoming was communication. This negligence comes at a bad time for the administration. Earlier this month, when FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced the first measures to fight FAS’s gaping budget deficit, student feedback was requested defensively and almost reluctantly, even when most of the cost-saving measures affected student life. This opacity does not inspire trust; it has not only spawned the Undergraduate Council’s grandiloquent “We Are Harvard” campaign but also fostered new rumors about further cuts. One of these claimed that Lamont Library would not be open around the clock next year—speculation that was summarily rejected by a College Library spokeswoman yesterday. What we need is honest and clear dialogue with the administration, both during emergencies and in everyday life. 
The irony of Dean Hammonds’s timing notwithstanding, it is commendable that President Faust went to Kirkland on Monday evening to reassure students. That night, she was visible and accountable. And yet we clearly need to reform the emergency contact systems,so that only accurate information is disseminated and such information minimizes fear and stress. In the same light, the administration must use those principles of openness and honesty to reform the way it involves students in decision-making beyond public safety crises, particularly when these decisions affect students’ lives at Harvard. Only through dialogue can the administration foster the feeling of trust that brings communities together.  
After all, the last thing we should be doing in a time of emergency is reading about it in a newspaper.

Justin Cosby, a 2005 Cambridge Rindge and Latin graduate with no known ties to Harvard University, died Monday after being shot in the abdomen shortly before 5 p.m. in the basement of J-entryway of Kirkland House Monday.
An “extremely active” homicide investigation is underway into the death of Cosby, who was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for care soon after the shooting and died there early yesterday morning, according to Middlesex County District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85.
Witnesses reported seeing between two and three suspects flee the scene. Several residents of J-entryway, located in a sector of the House known as the Kirkland “annex,” reported hearing three loud sounds resembling gunshots.
Leone said at a press conference yesterday afternoon that police were “still developing facts” about why Cosby was inside Kirkland House, and that it was unclear how precisely Cosby gained access to the building. Intent and motive for the shooting also remain a mystery, he said.
The suspects have not been identified, nor have descriptions been released.
“We’re not suspicious of any Harvard students being involved in this shooting at this time,” Leone said.
Leone said that a weapon has not been located.
State police crews collected forensic evidence at the scene of the incident Monday.
At 7:20 p.m. Monday, a line of 11 Harvard and Cambridge police officers spaced themselves out across the grassy Malkin Athletic Center quad, walking toward Kirkland from the Lowell House side with heads bent as if looking for something.
Several students in Kirkland reported hearing a series of three loud sounds.
Greta I. Friar ‘11, who lives in J-entryway, said she heard three shots, and immediately after, someone saying, “Shit, shit! Oh, shit!” Friar said she later saw bullet casings on the stairwell in the entryway.
Bryant Bonner ’09, a student in E-entryway of Kirkland, said he heard bangs while sitting at his desk around 5:00 p.m., then “saw three people running from J-entryway through [his] window. They were wearing baseball caps.”
Kirkland House Master Tom Conley, who spoke to police shortly after the shooting, also said two to three suspects fled the scene after the incident.
Cosby then left Kirkland House and travelled up Dunster Street towards Mt. Auburn Street, where he was met by witnesses who say that he struggled to keep moving and collapsed on the ground before asking for water. Cosby was bleeding from the lower torso but was still conscious, according to Dental School student Jared M. Sprague, who said he helped support the victim after the shooting.
Sprague said he was walking towards the Malkin Athletic Center from the Education School when he saw Cosby stumbling toward him. Another woman on the scene called 911 upon witnessing Cosby’s distress, Sprague said.
When paramedics arrived, Cosby was put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to Beth Israel, where his condition was “stable,” according to reports from Cambridge Police Department Spokesman James DeFrancesco over the course of the evening.
The victim’s mother, Denise Cosby, said that her son died at 3:30 a.m. at Beth Israel, where she was attending to him.
Cosby said she did not know what her son was doing on Harvard’s campus. She saw reports of the shooting on television Monday evening, she said, but went about her life with no idea that her son was involved in the incident until she got a call from a friend of his at the hospital.
Kirkland House Masters Tom and Verena Conley notified the House of the shooting in an e-mail sent at 5:32 p.m Monday. A Harvard University text message alert was sent to students subscribed to the system 13 minutes later.
“We ask everyone to cooperate with the police and staff in the hours ahead,” the House Masters wrote. “We will apprise everyone of further developments.”
Conley said later Monday evening that administrators were making preparations to extend “exam forgiveness” to students hampered by delays due to that day’s incident. The provisions would allow Kirkland residents to “renegotiate the taking of exams because people are unable to get to their things and their rooms,” he said.
According to Conley, students were “visibly shaken but very reassured” as of Monday evening.
Leone, the district attorney, said at yesterday afternoon’s press conference that police “do not believe there to be an ongoing safety or security threat” in the wake of the shooting, and a Harvard police advisory e-mailed to students on Monday that police believe the incident was “isolated.”
Around 8 p.m., University President Drew G. Faust walked into Kirkland, telling reporters that she was there to address students.
Massachusetts, Cambridge, and Harvard police were all on the scene as of 6:30 p.m. News helicopters were also hovering overhead midway through the hour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male undergraduate student was allegedly mugged at knife point Monday night, according to a community advisory e-mail issued by the Harvard University Police Department yesterday morning. The student was walking on Plympton Street between Mass. Ave. and Mt. Auburn Street at about 11:45 p.m. on Monday night, when he was allegedly approached by a man holding a knife, the e-mail stated. The armed man allegedly demanded the student’s property, and the victim handed over his Ipod and money. The alleged perpetrator fled, and the student was left unharmed, the e-mail said.The student has stated that his alleged attacker was wearing a bandana, but could provide no further description, according to the e-mail.  An individual was briefly detained for the crime Monday night, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano. Loyal B. Egan ’12 said he observed a handcuffed man sitting outside Quincy House surrounded by police around midnight Monday night. There were about four police cruisers and a police van parked on Plympton Street and Mass. Ave., according to Egan. He also observed a college-aged man entering a police cruiser with HUPD officers.“[An officer] told me that somebody was mugged at knife point right on Plympton, right outside The Crimson,” Egan said.Officers were searching the immediate area with flashlights, according to Egan. Because the incident did not occur on an area of campus that qualifies as University property, the case will be handled by the Cambridge Police Department, according to the advisory e-mail.No one has been arrested for the crime, according to CPD spokesperson James DeFrancesco.The CPD believes that the robbery is an isolated incident, DeFrancesco said. No police log entry was yet available from the CPD documenting the alleged crime. At this time there is no reason to believe that the armed robbery is related to a shooting that occurred yesterday in Kirkland House, according to Catalano. This year, the Harvard student community has received e-mail advisories about six robberies or attempted robberies that have occurred since August 2008. HUPD was dispatched for 14 robberies last school year, three of which occurred on Harvard’s Cambridge campus, according to the HUPD Web site.—Staff writer Emily J.

The General Education committee—which approved approximately 150 of 221 total classes that will count for Gen Ed credit this past spring—is readying the new curriculum for full implementation in the fall, as a new Gen Ed office prepares to move into fresh quarters in the Holyoke Center.Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Stephanie H. Kenen will serve as the administrative director of the new Gen Ed office, and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who also chairs the Gen Ed committee, will serve as its faculty director.The Gen Ed office will absorb its predecessor, the Core office, according to College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds. Gen Ed committee member and Slavic Professor Julie Buckler said that Harris told the committee at a recent meeting that the new office will be in the Holyoke Center and that the administration is hoping to have offices available for teaching fellows. Harris, Kenen, Hammonds, and Core Program Director Susan W. Lewis declined to comment further.In the meantime, the fate of Core office staffers remains uncertain as they prepare to move out of their office at 77 Dunster St. at the end of June. The Office of International Programs—which was moved from the basement of University Hall to 2 Arrow St. this year—will move into the Core Program’s office at 77 Dunster St., according to OIP Director Catherine H. Winnie.Financial constraints have prevented the Gen Ed committee from pursuing any money-intensive initiatives in the short term, including a proposed great books track, according to Gen Ed committee members.Kenen said that while the committee had been worried that the committee would not receive enough course proposals, those worries were dispelled by a flood of proposals this spring.“Faculty, like students, wait till the deadline to get their proposals in—and after,” said Kenen, who added that about 80 course proposals came in around the March 20 deadline.But former Gen Ed committee member Alexander N. Chase-Levenson ’08 said that the committee was more concerned with the variety of courses available than their number.Gen Ed committee members admit that there is still be more work to be done. While the humanities category Aesthetic and Interpretative Understanding boasts 15 new Gen Ed courses—with 36 total classes counting for credit—five other categories, including both in the sciences, have only a few newly developed Gen Ed classes.A quarter of the 221 total approved classes—174 of which will be offered next year, the rest the year after—are Gen Ed classes, while the remaining 156 courses will be departmental alternatives and Core classes counting for Gen Ed credit, according to Gen Ed Program Manager Anne Marie E. Calareso.—Staff writer Bonnie J. Kavoussi can be reached at kavoussi@fas.harvard.edu.

A campus-wide emergency text message notification system—commonly known as “Message Me”—faced its first major test on Harvard’s Cambridge campus after Monday night’s shooting, but several glitches may have hampered its effectiveness, prompting undergraduate complaints and administrative consideration of possible system modifications yesterday.At approximately 5:45 pm on Monday, Message Me subscribers received the first of several text messages notifying them of the incident “near Kirkland House on Mt Auburn St.” A later message informed them that Harvard University Police had deemed much of the campus, with the exception of Kirkland and Eliot Houses, safe enough for them to “resume normal activity.”Message Me was last used to inform members of the Longwood campus—which includes the Medical, Public Health, and Dental Schools—that classes and other activities were suspended due to suspected swine flu cases. After Monday night’s shooting, students at the College received their first emergency notification since the program’s debut last spring. But not all Message Me subscribers received the texts. Text messages reached about 98 percent of the 14,000 participants in the program, University spokesman Kevin Galvin wrote in an e-mail statement.But confusion was widespread, both among those who did not receive the texts and those who did.Many students said they failed to realize the system required them to opt in every year, even if they had signed up for the program in previous years.“I thought I was registered but wasn’t, so that was pretty surprising when everyone else was like ‘I got a text message,’” said Trevor G. Frankel ’09, who added that 15 to 20 minutes elapsed between when the messages were sent and when he learned of the shooting from other students. “We kind of got lucky that it was a kind of situation where [hearing the news immediately] wasn’t a matter of public safety.”Students have also reported failure to receive the texts due to poor cell phone reception in the Quad—an issue that the College has been working to resolve, Galvin wrote. Other delays likely resulted from the difference in cell phone service providers among Message Me users, he added.But another bug affected those who did eventually find the texts on their phones. The second sentence of the messages were truncated to read “Police ask people to remain indoors and avoi—” cutting off the two final words, “the area.”The error resulted from the Message Me system’s inability to send texts longer than 160 characters, including the message heading, according to Galvin.University officials conducted a series of meetings yesterday, discussing the performance of the Message Me system, and possible modifications and upgrades, including integrating it with Facebook or Twitter updates.Following Monday’s incident, the Cambridge Police Department did not send out text messages over a similar notification system put in place for area residents last year, since its activation requires “a series of incidents,” said spokesman James DeFrancesco.Emily J.

A day after the fatal shooting of a man in the Kirkland House Annex, students are returning to their exams amid lingering concerns over the initial University response to an incident that sent a wave of concern across campus.Kirkland students interviewed by The Crimson yesterday described a period of confusion immediately following the incident, during which a variety of sources provided inconsistent or insufficient information. The first University emergency text message alert, sent to subscribers nearly an hour after the shooting, was cut off by word-capacity constraints, reading: “Police ask people to remain indoors and avoi—” Kirkland resident Gladisley Sanchez ’09 said she was unsure when she could leave her room. The text message, she said, was unclear and the first e-mailed communications from the university were “cryptic, vague and brief.” “A lot of what I’ve learned has been through news sources,” said Kirkland Resident Elizabeth A. Cook ’10. “They should have informed us a lot earlier than they did.”But Kirkland students were appreciative of the response from the Kirkland community. “The most reassuring thing that happened was the response of our house masters,” said Michael J. Chance ’10. “Their response was a lot more reassuring than anything higher up.”But University administrators did reach out. Around 7:45 p.m., three hours after the shooting, University President Drew G. Faust arrived at Kirkland to speak with students—a decision that was lauded by House Master Tom Conley at yesterday’s meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.Conley himself held a meeting last night in the Kirkland Junior Common room for students and representatives from a variety of University services to discuss the University response.The meeting included representatives from Harvard University Police Department, the Harvard University Bureau of Study Counsel, and Institute of Politics Director and former Nashville mayor Bill Purcell, whom Conley said he invited because of his experience with coordination and dissemination of information.During the meeting, students voiced their communication concerns, according to Conley.Conley said he was working with the administration towards a better coordination of the messaging system, and a reconsideration of what sort of media might be best to communicate information in emergency circumstances.But Conley, who sent an e-mail across the Kirkland e-mail list-serv as soon as he arrived at a computer following the incident, defended the University response yesterday. “If a delay there was, it had to do with the dissemination of correct information and not speculation,” said Conley.Students and representatives at yesterday’s Kirkland meeting also discussed security methods, such as video surveillance, which currently is absent from the House.—Staff writer Noah S.

Two confirmed “swine flu” cases at Cambridge’s King Open School have not caused sufficient alarm to temporarily close the building, even as a multitude of suspected flu cases led city officials to close Boston Latin School, less than five miles away, for one week.The two cases of swine flu—known officially as the H1N1 virus—were confirmed last Friday, according to Justin T. Martin, a spokesman for the Cambridge Public Schools. He added that four students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School—the city’s only public high school—have displayed “flu-like symptoms.”  The school district’s Chief Operating Officer, Jim Maloney, said that shutting down King Open School, which is a K-8 school, was not necessary. “The guidelines from CDC are that we don’t need to shut down the schools,” he said. “Every day this week we had greater than 80 percent of the students in attendance.” In response to the cases, the school district has called parents to explain the situation, and on Friday the school sent letters home. Extra cleaning staff has been sent to the King Open School to provide additional sanitization, Martin said. Maloney said that the district was trying to contain the epidemic by emphasizing that students be vigilant in their hand-washing and that parents monitor their children for signs of illness.He added that it is difficult to contain such an illness to one building, as students share buses and go to after school programs at different schools. But yesterday, just days after the report of these two cases, Boston Latin School students were let out five minutes early due to concerns about swine flu and two strains of seasonal flu.Out of 2400 students who attend the 7-12 grade school, over 260 of them called in sick yesterday with flu-like symptoms, according to a press release from the office of Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino which was released yesterday afternoon. According to a letter sent out by Boston Public Schools’ superintendent, Carol R. Johnson, the school was closed to “prevent new infections and avoid unnecessary illness”—a decision coming with the “guidance of the Boston Public Health commission.” The 10th grade level MCAS math tests and all AP exams scheduled for this week have been postponed to next week, according to Johnson’s letter.  Additionally, the school’s junior prom, which was scheduled for this Friday, has been postponed “indefinitely,” said BLS senior Gloria T. Chin. She added that the seniors were supposed to end school this Friday, but they will now not finish school until the following week. While Chin said she thought closing the school was “a smart thing to do,” not all students agreed. Chaofan Yuan, also a senior, said he found it annoying.“I’d rather that they not cancel school,” he said. “I’m not that panicked about the disease.”—Staff writer Sofia E.

When Denise Cosby saw reports of a shooting on the Harvard campus headlining the evening news on Monday, she had no idea the victim was her son.
It was only when one of his friends phoned her from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center that she realized Justin Cosby was not in the next room.
Cosby, who suffered a bullet wound to the abdomen after a shooting in Kirkland House’s J-entryway, was declared to be in stable condition around 7 p.m. He died just eight hours later, with his mother at his side. He was 21.
“This is a shock to my entire family and all my friends,” Cosby’s mother said. “No one can believe it.”
Cosby’s presence in Kirkland House on Monday remains a mystery, but in interviews with The Crimson yesterday, those who shared a floor with Cosby and his mother shed some light on the victim himself, painting a picture of a boy always willing to lend a hand, often offering to help his neighbors carry the groceries.
“He was a mama’s boy,” Denise Cosby said, adding that her son chose to live with her and commute to Salem State College 15 miles away, which he attended part-time until this spring.
Cosby, who had completed roughly three semesters’ worth of work, officially withdrew in April, school officials said yesterday. Although he had not declared his major, Cosby said that her son had shared his post-college plans of “going into computers and looking forward to a nice, comfortable life.”
Friends posting farewell messages on Cosby’s Facebook profile paid tribute to the amateur basketball player as a strong presence in their social circle who always had a smile on his face.
Lucas R. Toffoli ’09, a resident of Mather House, first met Cosby in kindergarten. The two quickly bonded during recess, and by second grade, they could often be seen running around the King Open School playground and “terrorizing” others by pretending to be Ninja Turtles scaling the jungle gym.
Though Toffoli acknowledged that he and Cosby drifted apart the following year, he said that he saw his fellow bright-eyed Ninja Turtle become a high school senior much respected within his circle of friends as the kind of person who would “really come through for you when you needed him.”
Usually sporting carefully assembled “rapper-inspired” outfits—baggy T-shirt, baggy jeans, stylish basketball shoes, and “some bling from time to time”—Cosby was somewhat of a leader in his group of friends, Toffoli said. Or at least, Toffoli added, he was someone everyone knew and looked up to.
Having known Cosby as a “well put together kid with his head on straight” who seemed to steer clear of “gang-like crowds,” Toffoli said the news of the shooting was all the more surprising.
A Pokemon card aficionado in his childhood who once amassed an entire book of the much hyped collectibles, Cosby later channeled his energies into playing basketball and maintaining his ’95 BMW.
“He was very proud of this car,” his mother recalled.
Cosby said that she had no idea why her son, who lives with her in a high rise apartment building in Cambridge, was in Harvard Square. The current investigation has yielded neither intent nor motive, and it is unclear at this point how Cosby gained access to the basement of Kirkland House, according to Gerard T. Leone, Jr. '85, District Attorney of Middlesex County.
Cosby also leaves behind his sister, Shenita, who flew in from Atlanta upon hearing the news, and his longtime girlfriend whom he met in college.
“He was a good, young person,” said a neighboring tenant who identified himself only as “Leroy B.” and said he often played basketball with Cosby. “I hope justice is coming the right way.”

Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds presented a set of recommendations concerning the College’s primary disciplinary body, the Administrative Board, at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting yesterday. The report, the product of an 18-month review by the College Dean-appointed Administrative Board Review Committee, calls for greater attention to student needs in a process predominantly viewed as intimidating, Hammonds said at the final Faculty meeting of the year. The Dean’s remarks yesterday were meant to be an introduction to the Ad Board Committee’s findings—the  report’s recommendations will require final Faculty approval in the fall, “Students often do not have confidence in the Board, and faculty do not feel responsible to the Board or connected to the Board—even though the rules it enforces are, in fact, Faculty rules,” said Hammonds, adding that pervasive negative perceptions of the Ad Board challenge its effectiveness.Instead of requiring at least two-thirds of the full Faculty to vote on a student dismissal, the recommendations call for a small group of professors—separate from the Ad Board—to make the final decision.“The current practice, in which Faculty members are given only a summary of the case and then asked to vote, does not provide a complete review,” Hammonds said. “[But] distributing large amounts of very confidential case materials among the FAS Faculty is both unworkable and inappropriate.”Hammonds said she will be appointing additional faculty members to the Ad Board to address the Faculty’s sense of a “lack of ownership” over the disciplinary group. Greater faculty integration into the proceedings would also increase transparency and faculty awareness of Ad Board rules, according to Hammonds.“I can see all those smiles out there—people who are dying for this job,” she said.The report also recommends that students appear before a subcommittee of at most three people to ease feelings of intimidation. Currently, students are required to come before a group of at most 20 members of the Ad Board—which includes 31 standing members as well as a number of non-voting guests, and on occasion the University President and FAS Dean.Students would be allowed to bring into the room personal advisers—typically faculty members or FAS officers—who could suspend proceedings to take students out for a brief break to discuss case materials.The Secretary of the Ad Board or another College administrator—instead of the resident dean of the student’s House—would deliver all disciplinary charges from the Ad Board to the student in order to preserve his or her relationship with the resident dean.Hammonds, who said she will report to the Faculty on Ad Board proceedings at least two times a year, also emphasized the importance of bringing to light not only instances of students’ “badness,” but also their more “positive aspects.”“It can be pretty deadening to go to the Board meetings,” Hammonds said. “It would be beneficial for the Board to consider the accomplishments and interests of our students, in addition to this ordinary work, which often involves students who are in distress.”Professors who stood up to respond to the report—two of whom were former Deans of the College—expressed no disapproval for the committee’s recommendations.“When Dean Hammonds gives you the call, I hope you will all accept,” said math professor and former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 after Hammonds’ presentation. “This is really a part of your responsibility, and I hope you will respond with alacrity.”—Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors and deans converged for a final meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences yesterday afternoon, voicing optimism after a year of financial challenges and budgetary upheavals as protestors noisily rallied outside.University President Drew G. Faust said she has found herself speaking “endlessly” this past year of the anticipated 30 percent decline in the endowment. Last Monday, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith added to the growing list of reductions by announcing an array of budget cuts that primarily affected the College.“We need to focus not on what we have lost,” Faust said. “Let us try to focus our intentions on what we still have and how we can use that to the fullest advantage.”Faust urged the Faculty not to view the changes resulting from the financial crisis as mere losses, but as opportunities for the University to refine its priorities and reexamine its identity.“I think it forces us to ask who we are and who we intend to be,” Faust said. “We have to make very hard choices, we have to be willing to give some things up, and all of us are going to be finding ourselves doing things differently.”Despite all the financial constraints of the past year, the Faculty worked unhindered, Faust said, as she recited the many achievements made by members of the Faculty in the past year.“I’m sure some of you are sitting here right now, thinking, ‘Well, she didn’t mention my thing,’” Faust said when she concluded the list. “I apologize. Tell me about it. I’ll mention it next year.”THANK YOU, MADAME PRESIDENTDuring the question-and-answer session, Kirkland House Master Tom Conley complimented Faust’s actions in the wake of a Monday shooting of a Cambridge man in a Kirkland entryway.“I’d like to praise you for coming out of your way yesterday to the House,” Conley said of Faust’s visit to Kirkland after the incident. “Your work was absolutely outstanding.”“I’m very, very upset, as you can see. You can hear it in my voice,” added Conley, a professor in the departments of Visual and Environmental Studies and Romance Languages and Literatures, as he led the Faculty in a round of applause for Faust.“I might start liking question period,” she said. “Other questions?”VAGUE FAUSTWhen History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger took the podium during the question-and-answer session, he eschewed something that has become a habit for him—an expression of concern for the state of the University’s libraries.“Not about the library,” Hamburger assured the group before asking for clarification regarding the idea of “structural change” evoked by the FAS administration.Invoking the concept of “reshaping”—something of an administrative watchword in recent weeks—Faust said she did not want to “unduly constrain” the imagination of faculty members as the six working groups charged with reviewing further budget modification draw up proposals.“I don’t want to impose on you a set of approaches to these problems that might limit your ability to imagine,” Faust said.She added that structural changes could involve “better ways of sharing” administrative duties both to trim costs and maximize efficiency.—Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 150 students, workers and staff attended a rally outside of University Hall yesterday afternoon to support an effort aiming at greater transparency and inclusion in the University’s budgeting system.
The event, entitled “We Are Harvard,” came just over a week after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University’s largest school, enumerated $77 million in cuts to cope with the current financial downturn, affecting everything from athletic teams to breakfast offerings in the Houses and drawing a round of student and staff concerns. 
The organizers of yesterday’s protest had planned for it to coincide with the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that was slated to end at 5:15 p.m., but the meeting unexpectedly ended minutes before a critical mass of students had arrived. Many faculty members exited before students and staff were able to encircle the building in protest.
But by 5:15 p.m., a crowd that consisted mostly of students chanted slogans like “Hey hey, ho ho; Where did all the money go?” and held signs as they walked around University Hall. Very few workers were in attendance as many of them were unable to leave work in time for the event, according to representatives from the Student Labor Action Movement.
The rally was slated to focus on inclusion and transparency in the budget-trimming process, but some of the student and worker speeches seemed to drift off message—a number of them demanding that Harvard save jobs.
But a speech by Eva Z. Lam ’10, the president of the Harvard Democrats, refocused the group’s attention on the stated goal.
“We have the entire community here,” she said. “I’m not here to work against [Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences] Michael Smith. We can’t work with them unless they allow us to.”
“The students want to have input,” she said.
Adams House Committee Co-Chair Amol K. Jain ’10 said that Harvard students are often told they are the best and brightest. “If that’s true,” he said, “[Administrators] should really be asking us, including us.”
Judith H. Kidd, associate dean of Harvard College, said after the event that “anytime the students feel strongly enough about standing up and chanting, it gets the administration’s attention.”
“I think this was good,” she added.
Institute of Politics president Mary K. B. Cox ’10 said that even though many faculty members left the meeting early, the rally seemed to go “without a hitch.” She added that she suspected that only the event organizers noticed that the meeting had adjourned ahead of schedule.
Earlier yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m., event organizers handed out a sheet of paper containing information about the “We Are Harvard” rally to faculty members as they entered University Hall. Members of the Student Labor Action Movement also separately distributed folders with information.
In a separate event at 4:00 p.m., a group of Harvard workers convened around the John Harvard statue with members of SLAM and gave speeches in support of worker jobs.
Johnny F. Bowman ’11, a member of SLAM, told the workers present to “please keep the fight up, keep the hope up.” Bowman said that SLAM argues for a “collective sacrifice.” “We feel Harvard has a responsibility to its lowest paid workers,” he said.
Lam, an organizer of the “We Are Harvard” event, told workers, “We’re here for you. We’re not here just here for hot breakfast.”
Bedardo Sola, a staffer who was laid off and then rehired by Harvard subcontractor ABM OneSource, spoke to the crowd in Spanish. Daniel Brasil Becker, a representative for the Service Employees International Union Local 1615, interpreted Sola’s remarks.
“For Harvard we are numbers,” Sola said. “Numbers they write in with pencil—and erase as well.”
Harvard University Police Department officers stood at each entry to University Hall during both of yesterday’s rallies.
Organizers were instructed not to obstruct the entrances and the protest remained peaceful throughout the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The words “bafana, bafana” emanate from a practice room in the basement of Annenberg Hall on a Monday night this spring. Inside the room, a line of Harvard students wearing what look like rubber rainboots stomp their feet, twisting, jumping and slapping at their cumbersome footwear. One student voices commands in a foreign tongue: encouraging words in varied tones and volumes. The group responds. Such performative exchanges—not to mention the boots—are a good indication of what makes the group distinctive. But the Harvard College Gumboots Dance Troupe is about more than performance alone.  From South Africa, Gumboots is a tradition said to have originated with gold miners during the Apartheid. The dance acted as a means of expression among workers suppressed and forced to endure brutal conditions. Some were not allowed to move, kept away from their families, and shackled to their work. Rubber boots—“gumboots”—formed part of their uniform. Decades distant, and half a world away, Harvard’s Gumboots Dance Troupe aims to pay tribute to this particular period of struggle in South Africa’s history. Many former members of the group joined because of an affinity to the cultures of southern Africa, but the group has since maintained its creed while diversifying its participation, now attracting members from many different backgrounds.A MISSIONShazrene S. Mohamed ’04, originally from Zimbabwe, says she joined Gumboots her freshman year as a means of meeting other African students. Mohamed says that before coming to America, she did not know anything outside Zimbabwe. Gumboots was an opportunity to feel close to her home culture.“It was the people there,” she says. “In a lot of ways I was like the miners looking for comfort and company and something familiar.”When the group started struggling, Mohamed says she helped resuscitate Gumboots, taking over its teaching and choreography, in addition to helping with costumes.She recounts collecting bottle tops from the pubs around Cambridge, using a nail and hammer to make shakers for the group’s boots. She said that the bottle tops and shakers were supposed to represent the chains of the miners.Even though Gumboots was a part of the Harvard African Student Association when she joined, and included many African students, Mohamed says the group also represented an opportunity to expose non-African friends to African culture. She said that the West mostly perceives Africa as plagued with problems: AIDS, disease, and poverty.Now studying astrophysics as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Mohamed still sees it as her mission to share some of her heritage.Rangarirai M. Mlambo ’07, who is also originally from Zimbabwe and was a part of Gumboots throughout his undergraduate years, takes a similar persepctive. “One can take away as much or as little as one likes to form an adopted identity,” he said. “It is worth understanding the dance in context. It is a valid world historical phenomenon.”A UNIQUE SEQUENCEThe composition of the group itself suggests that the history and struggle behind Gumboots can be understood by anyone—African or not.Lisa C. Rosenfeld ’09, the current Gumboots president, is not African, and cannot claim as close of a connection with the continent as Mohamed, but her choreography maintains ties with traditions, while fusing in contemporary elements.“Occasionally we’ll create a new routine but in the most part we have a set tradition,” Rosenfeld says. “We break them up, rework them. Like a puzzle we keep putting them together, but the building blocks are fixed.”Sometimes inspiration comes from unexpected places. Rosenfeld recalls a trip to South Africa in her freshman year. On the airplane, she began speaking with a flight attendant who was familiar with gumboots. He did not believe that she, too, practiced the dance, but after performing a routine at the back of the plane, she picked up a new dance from him and the group used it in their next performance. “Little things like that is how we progress,” Rosenfeld says. Even as the group expands and diversifies itself, the dance remains true to its South African origins. Words in Zulu are repeated with every sequence.Naseemah Y. Mohamed ’12, Shazrene Mohamed’s sister, calls the language behind the dance extremely repetitive. “Even if it is very simple and basic,” she says, “there are a lot of ornaments that, combined with ululation and shouting, creates a dynamic.” Naseemah considers joining Gumboots a way to reconnect with her Zimbabwean roots and learn choreographically. For her, Gumboots is more than dance.“A lot of the rhythms are very southern African but because I understand the language, it relates to my culture—the rhythm of it all and the connection between the audience and the performer,” Naseemah says.“It is very organic and low stress,” said W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, who was born and raised in South Africa. “It connects people across years and countries.” Van Vuuren credits the Harvard Gumboots group for enabling him to discover more about his own country’s culture and history. “South Africans—in spite of our tumultuous history—are one of the warmest people. Our culture is very easygoing and accommodating to other people, and you really see that in Gumboots,” Hugo said. “Whenever a new American student showed up, it was about helping them get on board as soon as possible.” STOMPING OUT A MESSAGESometimes the simplest way to get people on board is through performance.On a Sunday night at Sanders Theatre, the diverse group takes the stage to perform for “Africa Night,” the largest collaboration between Harvard’s various schools to celebrate African music, fashion, story telling, and dance.Stomps and shouts are heard off stage. “Enyaweni shaya enyaweni shayaaa,” one Gumboots dancer shouts.Chioma M. Achebe ’10, producer of “Africa Night” and president of the Harvard African Students Association, says, “Gumboots was one of the dance groups we wanted because it is something a lot of people are not familiar with.” “Bafana, bafana.” The dancers halt, stand, and salute. “Saluti!” they ululate, as a tribute to those that inspired their dance, honoring a story about perseverance and triumph, about reaching out and looking homewards, about celebrating an African rhythm. —Staff writer Margherita Pignatelli can be reached at mpignat@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two text messages and an interview with a student obtained by The Crimson today suggest that Justin Cosby, the 21-year old Cambridge man shot in a Kirkland entryway on Monday, may have been involved in drug sales to Harvard students—a development that comes amidst continued public uncertainty over what brought Cosby to the basement of a Harvard residential dorm earlier this week. 
One of the text messages, sent to a Harvard student’s cell phone on May 5, makes explicit references to “jak herrer bud” and “CaliMIST,” both known to be popular strains of marijuana, according to an editor from the marijuana publication High Times magazine. The callback number on both messages matches a cell phone number registered to a Denise Cosby of Cambridge, Mass., according to Accurint, a subscription database owned by LexisNexis and used by law enforcement and legal agencies to trace personal information. Phone calls made to that number today went straight to a voice message that sounded like it was recorded by a young man but which contained no identification information.
Justin's mother Denise Cosby was interviewed by The Crimson Tuesday at her apartment on Memorial Drive. When she was contacted Wednesday evening to verify her son's cell phone number, she referred inquiries to the Cambridge Police Department. Two spokespeople for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, which is fielding all press inquiries for the case, did not immediately return The Crimson's request for comment Wednesday evening.
The May 5 message appears to be directed specifically to students. “Happy cinco de mayo too all my peoples &congrats on another skool year behind,” it begins. “got some crazy jak herrer bud n some caliMIST best of the best and still those 50s.”
The wording of another message, sent to the Harvard student’s phone on April 20—a date noted by marijuana enthusiasts as an occasion to smoke the drug in celebration—suggests that Cosby may have been selling something to his addressees.
“This text goes too all my peoples happy 420,” it reads. “Im gud allday today just hit me up asap stuffs gunna b goin fast.” 
The student who received the text messages, who asked that he not be named because the issue touched on questions of illegal activity, said that they were sent from a man he knew only as “Justin.” The student said he had been given Justin’s number and told that he was a person living in the area who could supply marijuana. The student also said he believed "Justin" dealt to several other Harvard students as well.
On one occasion, the student said, he arranged to meet Justin to buy marijuana. According to the terms of the arrangement, the student went to the Mather Courts and contacted the seller, who asked him to walk towards Boston before completing the transaction. Justin appeared accompanied by one other man to complete the sale, the student said.
The Boston Globe reported on its Web site Wednesday that Cosby was at Kirkland House to visit an unidentified female student there, a piece of information sourced to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the case.
