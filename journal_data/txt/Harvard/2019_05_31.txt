After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his first Commencement as University President, Lawrence S. Bacow conferred 1,554 bachelors of arts and bachelors of science degrees to the Class of 2019 during the morning exercises at Harvard’s 368th Commencement.
Bacow awarded 6,665 degrees to students across the University — including College seniors, students from Harvard’s graduate schools, and students from the Extension School — in Tercentenary Theatre Thursday. Thousands of family members, faculty, and distinguished guests crowded the Yard to participate in the traditional festivities.
Bacow also conferred nine honorary degrees at the morning exercises. The honorees include new secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and founding director of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture Lonnie G. Bunch III, New Yorker editor David Remnick, and former University President Drew G. Faust — who received a standing ovation when presented with her degree.
Kabir K. Gandhi ’19 and Genesis N. De Los Santos ’19 gave the undergraduate Latin and English speeches, respectively. Harvard Kennedy School student Lucila H. Takjerad delivered the graduate English address.
Gandhi’s speech — entitled “Bibliotheca et Hortus,” meaning “A Library and a Garden” — described Harvard as a garden and a library and urged his fellow graduates to take not only what they have learned from books, but what they have learned “about human wisdom and imagination.”
De Lo Santos recounted her childhood growing up in the South Street Housing Development in Boston, a place she said still “feels worlds apart” from Harvard. She spoke about her family’s close relationship with their neighbors who watched over them during troubling times, comparing these connections to the ones she formed during her years at the College.
De Lo Santos encouraged the graduates to “be conscious” of the privilege their degrees awarded them and give back to the world.
“Let us reflect, but more importantly, be conscious — conscious of the weight that our education holds, conscious of all those who simply do not have the opportunity that could have rightfully been someone else in our place” De Lo Santos said.
In her speech, Takjerad told the story of her illiterate mother who left war-stricken Algeria only after a man signed her name on a list, the only way to leave the country at the time. In remembering her mother, Takjered reminded the Class of 2019 that the little things in life can have a powerful impact.
“The power of little things, the least you can do, can bring real change,” Takjerad said.
Following the student speeches, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 introduced the deans of the various schools who presented degree candidates to Bacow. After his presentation of Harvard Business School candidates, Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria took a moment to congratulate his daughter Ambika Nohria ’19, a graduating senior in Adams House.
After Bacow conferred bachelor's of arts and bachelors of science degrees, several College students supporting fossil fuel and prison divestment and holding up posters began chanting “divest or this movement will not rest” and “divest, divest, divest and reinvest.” Some students at other schools soon joined the chorus of chants.
Divestment protests also decorated their graduation caps with orange fabric and signs to draw attention to their cause. Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign organized this protest as a part of a larger push to urge alumni to refrain from donating to the University while it is still invested portions of its nearly $40 billion endowment in the fossil fuel industry and companies tied to prisons.
Former United States Vice President and 2019 College Class Day speaker Al Gore ’69 joined student activists in calling on Harvard to divest its holdings from fossil fuels in his address Wednesday. Bacow has repeatedly said the University will not divest its investments in fossil fuel companies, arguing that the endowment should be not be used for political means.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking back on her time in East Germany during the Cold War and its aftermath, German Chancellor Angela Merkel assured members of the Class of 2019 that change is always possible in her address during the afternoon exercises of the 368th Commencement Thursday.
Merkel — speaking in German for the majority of her speech — described how the Berlin Wall stood in the way of freedom and how most doubted it would ever be torn down until people rose up in 1989.
“Where there was once only a dark wall, a door opened,” Merkel said. “Anything that seems to be set in stone or inalterable can indeed change.”
Merkel has served as chancellor of Germany since 2005 — she the first woman and East German to lead the European nation. She announced in October 2018 she would not seek re-election when her term ends in 2021.
A former chemist, Merkel began her career in politics in 1991 when she won a seat in the Bundestag, Germany’s federal parliament. Considered by many to be Europe’s most influential leader, Merkel is known for steering Germany through the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, welcoming nearly a million migrants and refugees into the country, and frequently criticizing United States President Donald Trump’s policies.
Merkel called on the graduates to “work together rather than alone” to find solutions to global problems. The long-standing chancellor has stood in staunch opposition to the rise of nationalist parties and politicians across Europe — a contingent that increasingly threatens Merkel’s establishment, centrist politics.
"Our way of thinking and our actions have to be multilateral rather than unilateral, global rather than national, outward-looking rather than isolationist,” Merkel said.
She listed a number of current issues — including climate change, gun violence, and racism — and told the Class of 2019 they would have to be leaders going forward.
“Your generation will be faced with the challenges of the 21st century in the coming decades,” Merkel said. “You are among those who will lead us into the future.”
Merkel used part of her 35-minute speech to highlight the relationship between the United States and Germany and praise the benefits of “transatlantic partnerships.” She referenced former Secretary of State General George C. Marshall’s 1947 commencement speech at Harvard in which he outlined his famous plan — later known as “The Marshall Plan” —for European political and economic recovery after World War II, which involved financial assistance toward reconstruction in post-war Europe.
“A transatlantic partnership based on values such as democracy and human rights has given us an era of peace and prosperity, of benefit to all sides, which has lasted for more than 70 years now,” Merkel said.
Merkel warned that going against international partnerships can be destructive.
“Protectionism and trade conflicts jeopardize free international trade and mask the very foundations of our prosperity,” she said.
Though Merkel never mentioned Trump in her address, her comments come in light of escalating trade wars between the U.S. and China. The European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom has warned European Union trade ministers that the U.S. administration may levy tariffs on billions of euros worth of European goods.
Merkel closed her speech in English, once again imploring graduates to use their actions to destroy harmful boundaries for the betterment of society.
“Tear down walls of ignorance and narrow mindedness, for nothing has to stay how it is,” she said.
Before Merkel took the stage, University President Lawrence S. Bacow gave his own address during the afternoon exercises.
He reflected on his first year as University President during his roughly 11-minute speech Thursday afternoon.
“During my brief time in office, the world has shown us how urgent our work is,” Bacow said. “I’m an optimist because I live and work among all of you.”
During the morning exercises, Bacow conferred 6,665 degrees to students across Harvard’s schools. Bacow also bestowed upon Merkel an honorary degree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Margaret M. Wang ’09, president of the Harvard Alumni Association, announced seven new alumni to serve on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second highest governing body — and six as directors of the HAA during their annual meeting Thursday.
The HAA meeting followed the morning exercises of the 368th Commencement where University Lawrence S. Bacow conferred 6,665 degrees to graduates across Harvard.
The Board of Overseers have a variety of responsibilities, including advising Harvard administrators, approving certain actions by the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — and generally influencing the school’s direction. The HAA board of directors serves as an advisory body to connect and increase alumni engagement around the world.
Thursday’s announcement follows the selection of Alice E. Hill ’81 as the next HAA president, a position she is set to begin July 1. Hill is the first Canadian and the first Australian to serve as HAA president.
Five of the elected Overseers — chosen from a slate of nine candidates — will serve six-year terms.
The new Overseers are Alice H. Chen, Janet S. Echelman ’87, Vivian Y. Hunt ’89, Tyler E. Edwards ’83, John B. King, Jr. ’96, Reshma M. Saujani, and Ryan M. Wise.
Echelman will serve for four years, taking over for Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar ’93. Cuéllar was elected to the Corporation in February. Wise will serve for one year, completing a term began by James Hildreth ’79, who resigned from the board due to professional obligations.
All Harvard degree holders, barring those in University governance positions and Corporation members, are eligible to vote in the election. This was the first year that eligible voters could cast their ballots online in addition to the traditional mail-in ballot
This year’s election saw an uptick in voter participation: Degree holders cast 36,735 ballots in the 2019 election, a 37 percent increase from the total of ballots cast in 2018.
During the meeting, Wang reflected on the “rich history” and singularity of the Board of Overseers.
“Our Board of Overseers is virtually unique among governing bodies at universities because its members are elected entirely by members of our alumni community,” Wang said.
The new HAA directors — who will each serve three-year terms — are Bryan C. Barnhill II ’08, Ethel Billie Branch ’01, Salomé Cisnal de Ugarte, Adrienne E. Dominguez ’90, Christina L. Lewis ’02, and Zandile H. Moyo ’00.
All but Edwards were endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni group that focuses on increasing diversity across the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a break with tradition, roughly 30 Winthrop House seniors opted to receive their diplomas Thursday from a member of the House’s senior common room, rather than its faculty deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson.
Law School Professor Intisar A. Rabb delivered those students' diplomas instead of Sullivan and Robinson, who have been the target of criticism for months following Sullivan’s announcement in January that he would represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as Weinstein faces criminal charges for rape and sexual assault. Activists have since called for Sullivan to step down and made several demands of the College, including that it should select an “alternate” to perform Sullivan’s Commencement duties.
Following a review of the House’s “climate,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced May 11 that Sullivan and Robinson would not return to Winthrop in the fall, though they would continue until the end of their term on June 30.
“Between now and June 30, the College will work with Deans Sullivan and Robinson to assist them with upcoming events, such as Commencement, housing, and financial administration,” Khurana wrote in his email announcing the deans’ impending departure.
Graduating seniors receive their diplomas midday during Commencement at their houses. Typically, the house’s faculty deans hand out the diplomas.
Most of Thursday’s ceremony proceeded as usual for Sullivan and Robinson, who attended morning Commencement exercises, addressed graduates and family members on Winthrop's lawn, and delivered the vast majority of diplomas.
In his comments to the audience, however, Sullivan noted the logistical change and attributed it to the size of the graduating class.
“We have more graduates this year than we have had in any year in our 10-year tenure as faculty deans, so we're going to split the workload by three,” he said. “I'm going to award some, Faculty Dean Robinson is going to award some, and our long-time senior common member Professor Intisar Rabb — professor of law, professor of history at Harvard — is going to award some.”
Sullivan and Robinson handed out diplomas first. They divided the class in half and awarded diplomas to students in alphabetical order, occasionally skipping students. Rabb then followed the pair, handing the remaining diplomas to those whom the deans had skipped.
Though he did not discuss the distribution of diplomas any further, Sullivan also noted the controversy that had encircled Winthrop over the course of the semester.
“It goes without saying that during this past semester, we have experienced at Winthrop House some disquiet and some discord,” he said. “I have enormous pride in how most Winthropians have behaved in times of challenge and controversy. It is indeed a measure of our collective character.”
A number of protests followed Sullivan’s announcement that he would represent Weinstein. Protesters staged a sit-in at the House earlier this month, and earlier in the semester, a vandal spray painted slogans on the House’s exterior calling on Sullivan to step down.
The controversy over Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein comes at the close of his and Robinson’s decade-long leadership of the house, which has previously been marred by accusations that the pair have created a toxic and retaliatory environment for House employees.
Just one day after The Crimson reported the allegations against Sullivan and Robinson, Khurana announced that he would let the pair go.
Winthrop students made up a small portion of the 1,554 College graduates who received degrees Thursday.
