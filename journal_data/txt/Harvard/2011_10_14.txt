After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A confession: I am a senior. It was bound to happen. After taking a normal load of courses for the past three years and negotiating the various academic hurdles that came my way (I see you, Core v. Gen Ed debate), I have made it to my final year at Harvard. I don’t quite know how it happened; I honestly don’t remember a few semesters tucked in there and am not sure they existed. But barring a few remaining obstacles (e.g. writing a thesis; avoiding the Last Chance Dance), I should be receiving a diploma on May 24, 2012.
I’m not particularly excited for this date, in large part because I don’t know what I will be doing after it. In high school, I knew college would follow. There: the next four years, taken care of. But now, “next year” is an abstract goal with no obvious means.
Several institutions at Harvard exacerbate this mild anxiety with constant reminders that the end of college is near. They have become even presumptuous about my classmates’ and my graduation date. In the spring, we were hounded with emails from the Harvard Yearbook, asking us to sign up for photographs a full year in advance. Believing their sense of urgency that I must take my photo at that time—lo and behold, there were additional opportunities this fall—I made an appointment.
It thus far counts among the least pleasant experiences of my Harvard career; my awkward inclinations were heightened by the photographer’s insistence that I tilt my head this way, rotate my body the other way, and put my left hand on green. After that photo-shoot ended, I thought my time was over, musing that I could have put my $10 “sitting fee” to other, better uses (e.g. blowing my nose, killing a bug, or making a quiet ripping sound). But no! I was then forced to don a cap and gown, hold a “diploma,” and do it all again. I wondered why anyone would purchase a fake photo of me holding a fake diploma in a fake cap and gown in a random office on Brattle   Street. The value of a liberal arts degree is dubious enough; it need not be amplified by a phony diploma. Couldn’t we all just hold out until May 24 and use our cameras and cell phones? Or just wait 15 hours after graduation before Facebook photos are uploaded? A daguerreotype would be a better alternative to these weirdly premature surrogates.
Class rings are another hasty reminder of graduation. Ever since sophomore year, I have received emails from the kind people over at Harvard Student Agencies informing me that I could purchase a class ring for a mere $245. That price turned out to be the early-bird special; now, class rings cost at least $295, and promptly spike to prices that could single-handedly stimulate the American economy. But buying a ring, they tell me, would be an easy way to commemorate my alma mater after I’ve left.
It doesn’t stop there: the Office of Career Services hounds seniors with emails and events about finding jobs, writing essays for fellowships, and applying to graduate schools. The registrar gently asks us to confirm the date we are expecting to receive our diploma. The Harvard Alumni Association solicits us to become involved now for post-graduation responsibilities. When friends see me in formal clothing, they ask me if I am going to an interview. I’m probably not, and nor am I, hopefully, what Professor Larry H. Summers alternatively accused the Winklevoss twins of—I’m just low on laundry.
These are all reminders of our future lives. When we graduate, we will be paying bills for utilities and Internet; hiring a plumber when we have a leak; finding libraries with the books we want to read; looking for apartments. College provides these and many other resources for us, giving us a happy ignorance of the inconveniences to come. But now that we are seniors, we receive daily reminders of our impermanence.
But what’s the rush? I, too, feel a sense of urgency to prepare for next year, when I will enter a horrible world without HUDS and Yard Ops. But right now, Harvard institutions—and we seniors—should be less concerned with graduating than with the time we have left. College is a unique experience; we ought not be so ready to leave that we waste it. Applying to jobs and graduate schools is, of course, important, but getting ready for the real world doesn’t have to come at the expense of making the most of our time here. For we may realize that one of the greatest challenges we face after graduation is not what we will do outside of Harvard, but what we will do without it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students have undoubtedly noticed, the University has a new voice—or rather, voices.  In celebration of Harvard’s 375th anniversary, speakers mounted in trees have been speaking to students with the wisdom of some of the most famed persons ever to address our fair campus.
We applaud and commend the University for this astonishing policy change that will undoubtedly proffer a plethora of benefits for students and the greater Harvard community in some of the most troubled areas of the campus life and University policy.  We seriously could not be clapping harder.
One of the most important benefits that this improvement will yield is the creation of an inclusive and safe social space for all students in the Yard.  The college has tried this once before; the party-colored chairs were an attempt at such a move, but they made the Yard look more like a closeout sale at Ikea than somewhere that college students want to hang out.
These speakers, however, are a different story.  Under the exciting influence of Mother Theresa or Colin Powell’s soothing baritone, we are confident many Harvard students will be anxious to get down in the yard.  We only worry that under the combined influence of alcohol and Leonard Bernstein, the parties might get a little too crazy.  In fact, the only people who ought to be upset about the new social space in the Yard are the members of certain misogynistic, hetero-normative clubs and other single-gender organizations that perpetuate harmful social norms, because now the rest of the college is finally going to be as enlightened as we on The Crimson have been for so long!  Their parties will probably be just as cool too.
Along similar lines, in light of all of the protests in Boston lately, we feel that it is only a matter of time until these agenda-less ruffians make their way to our gilded halls, and we feel that with the wisdom of these veritable giants guiding them they will see the impotence of their protestations.
We don’t hesitate to say, however, that the benefits of the penetrating insights booming from the arboreal phalli will extend well beyond influencing our potential protesters.  In all likeliness, a strong nor’easter will pick up some time in the next few days, carrying the lofty sounds of sage advice to Allston, where it will more than make up for any missteps in University policy towards that community.  We wouldn’t be surprised to see a sudden inflow of thanks from Allston residents in regard to what amounts to the most pure gift the University could give them—it beats the pants off of free classes anyway!
We would also like to express our satisfaction that these speeches, none of which were given by finance moguls, are being delivered right in the middle of recruiting season.  Perhaps Goldman better watch out, or T. S. Eliot will in all likelihood talk them out of some prospects!
Perhaps most importantly, the new policy is very sustainable.  The University could have mounted the speakers on poles that would have had to been placed in the ground, interrupting a tiny underground ecosystem and probably killing some bugs, but it chose instead to use trees, a true testament to how far the school has come towards real sustainability.  Green truly is the new Crimson.
While we could not think of any ways that these speeches would help with House renewal, getting hot breakfast back, or ending racism, we are sure that if we gave it some more time, we could come up with something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard, we’re constantly hearing about the importance of learning about China. Introductory Chinese language classes have huge enrollments. Large Gen Ed classes on Chinese history, philosophy, and culture continue popping up each year. University-run programs like the Harvard China Fund keep growing, including a recently opened center in Shanghai. And extracurriculars that involve China, from the Harvard College Association for U.S.-China Relations to the Harvard  College in Asia Program, are extremely popular among students.
How has this all come to be? There are a few conventional answers that explain why so many students are devoting their time to learning about China, and why American colleges and high schools are committing so many resources to these programs and projects. First, the careerist reason: People are learning about China because that’s where the jobs are, where companies are hiring and sending young people. Second, the patriotic reason: China’s economic miracle has made it the country that will be the greatest economic competitor to the United   States, so we need to get ready. Third, the adventure reason: To American students who want to experience something radically different from the country they grew up in, China seems to be one of the most “foreign” places on the planet.
As a result, learning about China as an American student has been an essentially upbeat endeavor. We’ve believed that we would be the vanguard of a dynamic future between two global powers, successfully helping to build bridges of cooperation between the two countries, and perhaps even arrogantly (but happily) helping China to modernize and emerge in a way quite congenial to Western ideas and values.
As a history concentrator focusing on 20th century Chinese history, who has been studying Mandarin since high school, I spent much of the past decade benefitting from this optimistic environment for learning about China. But this climate is changing, and the would-be vanguard of a better future for the U.S.-China relationship now finds itself on the cutting edge American cultural insecurities. Engagement with China—the activity that was supposed to place us at the presumed center of this happy dynamism—is instead entangling us in our country’s current anxieties.
Particularly because of both the persisting economic crisis and the political difficulties in addressing it, widespread anxiety and insecurity about America’s future and the U.S.-China relationship exist in the U.S. today. Our concerns range from the troubled American economy and our seemingly paralyzed political institutions to a set of China-related issues: whether the U.S. will be able to meet growing economic competition from China, what China’s strategic objectives are, whether the U.S. and China are really going to be able to cooperate, and whether an irreversible American decline is accompanying China’s rise to superpower status. The past three centuries have demonstrated that it is a mistake to underestimate American resilience (and China’s own serious problems make its own continued rise hardly inevitable), but current American anxieties are undeniable.  And this affects not only our generation’s evolving attitudes toward China but also the attitudes that surround our generation’s expanding study of China and the Chinese language.
What will be our future roles if we become fluent in Mandarin? The possible answers are becoming entangled in the growing anxieties about America’s economic future and the future complexities of the U.S.-China relationship. In place of the straightforward excitement and optimism that accompanied the dramatic growth in the study of Mandarin in the past decade, we now see more anxiety and uncertainty.  In some cases, for example, learning Chinese has become a job-finding tool instead of a reflection of fascination with China or with hopes to be part of building a historically important and mutually beneficial U.S.-China relationship. For many students, studying Mandarin stops with very limited proficiency—not enough to read a Chinese newspaper or conduct a business negotiation—and may be simply a careerist statement that signals to a future employer: I’m a twenty-first century employee.
This may be particularly understandable given the incredible anxiety that current college students feel about employment opportunities. We are confronted with incessant media reports about the difficulties that college graduates face in the job market, innumerable stories of friends with strong resumes who can’t get hired anywhere they’d want to work, and the sense that most first jobs end up being barely more than summer internships. In this context, the symbolic meaning of studying Chinese seems a form of self-soothing as well as competitive signaling.
I do not mean to say that people are studying Chinese and learning about China for the “wrong” reasons; there’s no point in trying to determine “right” and “wrong” reasons for learning about another country, culture, or language. And, to be sure, it’s preferable to be at the cutting edge of America’s challenges and anxieties than focusing on the more minor things in life. But this changing environment for learning about China matters because it will affect whether all the news that has been presented as boding well for the future of U.S.-China relations—more Americans studying Chinese, traveling to China, and so on—will in fact translate into improvements in how Americans interact with China.
If Americans come to view China as a convenient Other that they can gesture toward to get ahead, but don’t recognize that true engagement and successful cooperation with a rising China requires persistent effort, patience, and understanding, then optimistic predictions about the benefits of learning Chinese may go unrealized. Finding ourselves living in a future in which many more Americans speak some Mandarin and know basic facts about China, but have no investment in engaging with China or improving the U.S.-China relationship, would be a sad eventuality indeed. We would be missing an enormous opportunity—for our generation to help shape history for the better, and for us as individuals to live more interesting and fuller lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Certain in his statement, Mayor Menino ordered the Boston Police Department to arrest me and 140 others early Tuesday morning. We were standing in a circle around our few dozen tents, linking arms and reassuring each other. The mayor said that we and the tents had to go—we were causing a nuisance. And, as I would later be charged, we were in the park after its 11 p.m. curfew.
As hundreds of police officers lined the square, we chanted: "We are the 99 percent. YOU are the 99 percent." One of them took a picture of us on his iPhone. Then the fully suited riot police charged the Veterans for Peace, casting their flags and America's to the ground. Screams went up and chants got louder as the line was pushed back. Soon they punctured the perimeter, and I looked over my shoulder to see angry police officers tearing down our tents in the moonlight. Roze, a friend since I had linked arms with her two hours earlier, looked at me, and I looked back. Neither of us had ever been arrested before. We were scared, but we were staying.
Suddenly the cops were upon us, and one was using his hands to club those of the girl to my left. "If you don't let go, I will force you to let go," he said, and he grabbed her small wrists and yanked. She wouldn't let go. So he turned to me, grabbed the lapels of my jacket, and wrenched me to my feet. He commanded me to lie down on my stomach while two other riot police tightened plastic cuffs over my wrists. Soon, I was in the pitch-black box of a paddywagon, speeding with eight others over the infamously pock-marked roads of Boston.
I had joined the protests a few days earlier, down on Wall Street. The people I met were of every ethnicity, and a majority were employed and college educated, many with professional degrees or PhDs. Everyone was frustrated that 99 percent of Americans have scarcely shared in income gains over the last three decades. Only having been alive for two of those, I'm frustrated knowing that when I graduate from college in June I'll enter the worst job market since the end of World War II. And while things are bad for a lot of us, the richest are getting richer, vastly richer. The richest one percent of Americans own more than 38 percent of America's wealth. 
The policemen who booked us into District 7, a jail in East Boston, certainly weren't seeing any of that money. At four in the morning they were trying to find scissors that could cut the zip-ties off one of my compatriot's blue-purple hands and in the meantime hacking towards his wrist with a pocket blade.
Finally, I was booked, and my fingerprints, mugshot, and belt were taken.  Soon I was in a disgusting cell reeking of urine and worse. The toilet was brimming, the metal bench narrow, and the plexiglass over the bars had etched graffiti going back to '93.  My cellmate and I talked about our lives and about the Occupy movement. He was a drummer who played for yoga studios and movie scores until work dried up with the recession. He had lived at the park until this night in jail. I study Russian literature. When the guard threw in two chicken sandwiches and two cartons of milk, we found we were both vegetarian. Plugging our noses, we drank our milk, ignored the new yellow stains on our socks-bottoms, and tried to sleep.
No messiahs. No high-paid lobbyists. No campaign employees. No megabucks donations from the Koch brothers. No sponsorship from FOX News. No messaging bulletins from the DNC.
We're doing this ourselves, for ourselves, for each other. If we don't have all the answers yet, that's because the questions are enormous. We have been grappling with these questions for years: How can we create a society where we all have a fair shot at a good life? How is a million dollars a small sum for a few hundred thousand Americans but a staggering one for me?
The thrilling thing is that we're asking each other these questions right now, and we're listening to each other’s answers. At 6:30 a.m. the guards at District 7 cuffed us one to the next and loaded us back into the paddywagon to go to court. Delayed by a mix-up with our paperwork, one cop opened up the back and shot the breeze with us. He confessed himself an "asshole," but would let us speak for a minute before trying to shoot down our answers. Even if we couldn't convince him, we got to listen to each other. And at the end I asked the cop if he had any kids. He did, a 9-year-old girl. I asked him if she would be here with us if she was a little older. "I'm sure she would—the little rebel," he said before leading us into the small holding cell I would share with twenty-one other shackled prisoners for the next eight hours.
The cop's daughter isn't out holding signs and being arrested with us, but we're fighting for her future just as much as we're fighting for mine and, yes, yours. If we don't hang together we will surely be hanged separately, not by the hangman’s noose but by hunger on America's streets or Africa's, by war in a foreign land or your doorstep, by another killer hurricane or new-born desert or infernal wildfire. We've got a start, but this movement needs to keep building. We are the 99 percent. This is our country, our planet, our future.
When I was released around four o'clock, not having eaten or seen the sun in twenty hours, having grown accustomed to the hobbling gait of the shackled, having accepted a plea-bargain that lessened my charges to a civil one, assembly without a permit, and a $50 fine, a small group of Occupiers let up a cheer and handed me water and a banana.
We're listening to each other, talking to each other, finding common ground and new friends, standing together and demanding the fair shot at life that our elected officials have promised us but our votes haven’t gotten us. We won't go away, even if mayors who cannot tolerate civil disobedience send their sworn officers against us. I hope you'll join us.

Veronica E. Manzo ’13 conducts research on treating an aggressive type of brain cancer, but she also does what many traditional researchers do not do—she interacts with cancer patients.
“Through my volunteering at Dana-Farber [Cancer Institute], I work in hands-on care,” said Manzo, a neurobiology concentrator. “I give 10-15 minute massages to a wide variety of patients, all with different types of cancer ... It’s made my research a lot more personal.”
Manzo began investigating cancer in her freshman year at Dana-Farber, where she worked in clinical breast cancer research.
Most recently, the Leverett House resident spent the summer at DePinho Laboratory to study Glioblastoma Multiforme, the most common form of malignant brain tumor found in humans. The project, conducted through Harvard’s Program for Research in Science and Engineering, involved targeting and killing a particular type of tumor cell.
“It is a very progressive, deadly disease,” said Manzo. “For patients that have this type of tumor, we would be able to inhibit the growth of their tumor cells.”
Throughout the summer, Manzo spent over 40 hours a week in her lab, working alongside her postdoctoral fellow and several graduate students.
She said that her initial experience was challenging because there was a “steep learning curve” to the research techniques used in the lab.
But others in the lab said they were impressed by Manzo’s research abilities.
“Veronica is very diligent, “ said Rujuta Narurkar, a senior research associate who helped train Veronica in the lab. “She is good at multi-tasking and was very involved in the results.”
Currently, Manzo has moved to the second phase of her research: testing the lab’s findings on mice.
Though her cancer lab will soon move to Houston, Manzo plans to continue researching, and hopes to work on her senior thesis in the upcoming summer.
“I love working with cancer and tissue cells,” said the California native. “The fact that my research can affect a real cancer patient is the most interesting part. It provides a real motivation.”
In the future, Manzo hopes to become a doctor, and she plans to attend medical school after college.
“Doing research has helped me become a better scientist. It will play a role in my future,” she said.
In fact, through Harvard Latinos in Health Careers, she is currently planning a medical mission trip to the Dominican Republic.
Manzo said that aside from getting hands-on experience, she is excited to assist individuals without consistent access to health care.
“I’m really looking forward to helping these underserved, rural communities,” she said.

Harvard researchers have identified a biomarker for Huntington’s Disease, a discovery that may allow physicians to track the effectiveness of treatments and the progression of the neurodegenerative, genetically dominant disease.
The study, published online last week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that Huntington’s patients express the biomarker H2AFY 1.6 times as much as people without the disease.
The project, a collaboration between Harvard Medical School faculty Clemens R. Scherzer and Steven M. Hersch, identified many possible biomarkers for Huntington’s, but decided to use H2AFY, a transcriptional biomarker that can be measured with a blood test. This biomarker was isolated by testing blood samples of patients who were healthy, had Huntington’s, or had another neurodegenerative disease. These patient categories allowed the researchers to disentangle biomarkers associated with all neurodegenerative diseases from those specific to Huntington’s. In testing on mice and in a two-year study on Huntington’s patients, a correlation was found between the rise in the H2AFY biomarker and the onset and worsening of the disease.
There is no known cure for Huntington’s disease, and it is very difficult to track the success of treatments because the disease is highly variable and progresses slowly.
Phase II medication trials—involving studies of 60-70 patients for about six months—are often inconclusive. Researchers must rely on phase III trials, which are much more expensive and track hundreds of patients over a number of years.
“The problem is that the current clinical trial design is very inefficient,” Scherzer said.
Scherzer added that there is currently no medication that can slow the disease process. Physicians can only provide treatments that alleviate the symptoms of the disease, which Scherzer appear when patients are in their 30s and 40s, and include jerking movements, depression, behavioral problems, unsteady gait, and slow degradation of the mind that results in dementia.
“There are many aspects of the disease that one can intervene in and help people with, even as they decline over time,” Hersch said. In addition to his research, Hersch also treats Huntington patients clinically, addressing each symptom individually with physical therapy and medication.
Hersch said the researchers’ next step is to test this biomarker in a large-scale three-year longitudinal study performed by the Huntington Study Group. While that goes on, Hersch and Scherzer will continue to improve and refine their biomarker test, and continue to develop a “toolbox” made of “a suite of biomarkers” in conjunction with neuroimaging that may facilitate reliable drug testing at the phase II level.
Scherzer hopes that one day, he can achieve his “holy grail,” which would be to convert this research into a test similar to that for “cholesterol level,” in which Huntington’s can be monitored and treated according to test results.

Harvard scientists at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have succeeded in capturing light within diamond pillars embedded in silver, allowing them to release individual photons at a specific rate.
The research—published in the journal Nature Photonics earlier this week—will pave the way for future advances in quantum networks, in which information will be encoded and transmitted using quantum states of fundamental particles.
“Instead of using laser light to send information down optical fiber, here you would actually communicate using single photons,” explained Principal Investigator Marko Loncar, an associate professor of electrical engineering at SEAS.
“If you excite them in a certain state, they can stay in that state for a very long period of time. You can use it as a memory,” he continued.
Loncar’s research leveraged inherent defects in diamonds, called color centers, which usually just appear as discolorations on the surface of the stone. Sometimes, these color centers are accompanied by a tiny hole in the diamond called a vacancy. These vacancies can be used to emit red photons one by one, a process with great promise for the development of large quantum networks.
Loncar noted that their experiment differed from that of other researchers, since the team used standard techniques that would allow for easy scalability in the future.
“People have demonstrated one node or two nodes, which is very different from a microprocessor that has billions and billions of transistors,” he said.
Loncar said there are some aspects of the research that he hopes to improve in the near future. One issue is that a large percentage of photons are totally reflected inside of the diamond and, therefore, are essentially unusable.
He is already planning future experiments, in which he will manipulate silver in specific patterns to increase the proportion of photons than can be detected.
“To increase collection efficiency, we must essentially make a bullseye pattern on our pillar,” Loncar said. “We will have a target made of silver, and in the middle there will be a piece of diamond. Basically it is a grating which allows you to scatter photons out so they can be easily collected.”
Loncar’s research may also up new doors for the fields of data management and cryptography. Currently, ATM machines, as well as online banking and payment systems, often use extremely large prime numbers to encode sensitive data. Quantum networks may be substantially more secure.

A paraplegic woman could not weigh herself for her chemotherapy treatment. A woman with cerebral palsy had to have her arms taped down for radiotherapy because the staff did not have something as simple as Velcro positioning devices.
These cases are two of many that Lisa I. Iezzoni, director of Mongan Institute for Health Policy at Massachusetts General Hospital and  professor of medicine, highlighted in her analysis and commentary on disparities in health care treatment for people with disabilities.
Despite policies such as the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, Iezzoni reported in a paper published this month in Health Affairs that Americans with disabilities remain strikingly disadvantaged in health care, in issues ranging from inaccessibility to quality of treatment.
“Even the most basic things are often times inaccessible, like getting onto examination tables, getting into the mammography machines, getting onto the beds of  MRI scanners,” Iezzoni said.
Iezzoni said there are marked discrepancies for routine screenings as well as lifesaving operations.
For instance, women with disabilities were less likely to receive mammography and Pap test screenings, and people with disabilities are less likely to receive critical surgeries for cancers.
Behind the article is years of research by Iezzoni and her colleagues, in addition to various statistics published by organizations including the U.S. Census Bureau.
“With the article I wanted to not only capture evidence on the health care disparity but also give people who are unfamiliar with it a flavor of how we think of the word ‘disability,’” Iezzoni explained.
Iezzoni, who has used a wheelchair for 23 years due to multiple sclerosis, began her research on the issue of health care and disability after people began to approach her about the matter.
“It initially did not occur to me to do research on disabilities,” Iezzoni said. “Only after seeing that there was not much literature out there and realizing I could contribute something with my own insight, that I started doing that kind of work.”
In her article, Iezzoni broached the topic of disability in the greater context of civil rights, with hopes that her research would have a broad impact on not only policy analysts but also the research community, advocacy groups, and health care providers. Increasing accessibility and challenging erroneous assumptions and stigmas against people with disabilities are key to bridging the disparity gap in health care, she said.
“One of the reasons why the health care field is so behind on this is because they only see people with disabilities when they are sick—providers think of them as having limited lives,” Iezzoni said. “Providers see it like this: if you need to be moved, we will move you. But people with disabilities would much rather be involved in moving themselves, in being able to transfer themselves onto the examination table.”

Researchers at the Children’s Hospital Boston and the Harvard Immune Disease Institute have taken a step toward determining the mechanisms that govern the frequency and location of genetic mutations.
Their findings, published in the September 30 issue of Cell, could contribute to scientists’ understanding of cancer genomics and lead to future developments in gene therapy-based treatments for a wide range of diseases.
Cancerous genes are often the result of translocation mutations, in which parts of separate chromosomes physically break off and swap locations, forming "fusion" genes that encode for new, possibly cancerous functions.
But the rules governing the process remain unclear.
Led by Frederick W. Alt, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of the IDI, the team developed a method for mapping "hot spots" in the genome where chromosomes are most likely to break and recombine.
To do so, Alt and his colleagues developed a method called high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS), which is based on the action of DNA-cutting enzymes such as I-SceI.
Results revealed that broken chromosome segments are more likely to fuse near the beginning portions of genes, in areas called transcription start sites.
"The idea that transcription might cause breaks has been discussed for a long time, particularly from studies of bacteria and yeast," Alt said. "I think our paper shows rather conclusively that breaks do get generated widely by transcription and can indeed serve as substrates for translocation."
Alt said the next step in the research process is to determine the specific factors of transcription that cause chromosome breaks.
"There is more than one possibility," he said. "We are working on a potential collaboration with researchers from MIT to develop ways to approach the problem."
The potential impact of this research on the development of treatments for cancer and other conditions caused by gene mutation is multifaceted.
According to Alt, in its most plausible application, the research will contribute toward screening for tumors and possibly slowing their growth.
Monica Gostissa, a co-author of the paper and postdoctoral fellow working with Alt, added that the mapping technique could make it possible for researchers and companies cutting and using DNA to "better understand and prevent unwanted cuts."
While prenatal screening or diagnosis of diseases based on mapping chromosome "hot spots" is still far off, Alt said he is optimistic that the scientific community will eventually understand the rules controlling chromosome translocation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts at an Institute of Politics panel convened Thursday to discuss the Occupy Wall Street movement expressed surprise at the speed with which the movement has coalesced but expressed uncertainty about its long-term implications.
Noting that the Occupy Wall Street protests only began about four weeks ago, Columbia University Professor Todd A. Gitlin ’63 voiced astonishment at how quickly the movement has gained traction.
“It is remarkable that we have come to this point where we are actually having a discussion about strategies, about impacts, and about politicians being put on the spot,” Gitlin said.
Vanessa S. Williamson, a Ph.D candidate in government and social policy, added that the protesters have established an impressive presence nationally.
“The level of organization is very surprising. The media setup is very impressive,” Williamson said.
Panelists seemed to agree that one of the central issues of the protests is anger regarding the current state of the economy, particularly the growing income disparity between the rich and the middle class.
“Consider that 10 years ago the median income was $53,000. Last year it was $48,000,” said former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, a Democrat. “That’s not a huge difference, but what makes that frightening is that for the first time in our country’s history, the median income has gone down.”
Gitlin said that these frustrations have been brewing for a long time.
“For four decades, the plutocracy has been growing in clout and wealth. The question is, ‘What took so long?’” Gitlin said. “I don’t have a simple answer to that, but given the degree of avoidable hurt ... it is remarkable that it’s taken so long for this boiling of feeling and initiative.”
Despite widespread comparisons between Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party, panelists were cautious about identifying similarities between the two.
“The Tea Party was really concerned with stopping change,” Williamson said. “It’s much easier to stop change than to create it.”
She also added that there are different support systems in place for the Occupy movement.
“There certainly has been support for the Occupy Wall Street movement by the media, but not to the same extent as the Tea Party [by conservative media outlets], in part because the left-wing media does not have the same mechanisms for mobilization,” Williamson said.
The participants, however, were cautious about charting the movement’s future.
“Social scientists know almost nothing about how movements operate. For that matter, neither do people in movements,” Gitlin said. “There are no formulas. You can’t stir ingredients and make a movement occur.”
Occupy Wall Street is a movement that began in New York City in mid-September, with participants generally voicing discontent regarding the state of the economy, income inequality, and the prevalence of corporate interest in politics.
The occupation has inspired many similar protests nationally, including Occupy Boston, which is now in its second week and which has led to the arrest of at least five Harvard students and alumni.
Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92, a senior lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, moderated the forum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ferran Adrià, considered one of the world’s greatest chefs, launched the Global Ideas Challenge Competition Thursday at the Harvard Business School.
Adrià has partnered with the third largest telecommunications company in the world, Telefonica, to challenge MBA students from five global business schools to help transform Adrià’s renowned restaurant, elBulli, into the elBulli Foundation, a center for culinary innovation.
The elBulli Foundation, replacing the restaurant that closed in 2011, will be located in Rosas in the Catalonia region of Spain.
Students from Harvard, Berkeley, Columbia, Esade (Spain), and London Business School will compete to propose the best plan for the new foundation.
“[It’s a] project of creativity and business, a project of everyone,” said Adrià, a Catalan chef who worked at elBulli since 1983. “The competition is to improve on what I have already done.”
Students will have the freedom to draw up almost any plans for the new foundation, Adrià said.
And he said the students will have plenty to work with as they help construct the foundation from the ground up.
“How can elBulli Foundation be made economically sustainable? ... What organizational structure should elBulli adopt? ... What mechanisms should be adopted to attract the best international talent?”
These are just some of the questions students face, according to the official rules of the competition.
Adrià said that ways in which technology is incorporated will be an important aspect to consider, as will be designing an eco-friendly facility.
Since the restaurant is located in a natural park, it “needs to be ecological,” Adrià said.
Students should also propose ideas on identity, personality, and positioning—essentially the elBulli Foundation’s overall character.
Financial aspects and logistics, such as how to manage visitors, should also be determined by the competing students.
The project proposals are due in April 2012; the foundation will open in 2014.
“The final goal is the relationship between creativity. We don’t want to make profits, but we want to have enough money for the foundation,” Adrià said.
Adrià decided to close his award-winning restaurant elBulli because he was “fed up of people asking for a table,” he said. He wanted to do something through the medium of cooking in conjunction with students—hence his competition.
Harvard fits “perfectly” with the goals of the Foundation, Adrià said, because Harvard recognizes the importance of cooking—referring to the College’s popular “Science and Cooking” course.
Cooking, Adrià said, is “an amazing language.” It “is the oldest discipline in the world related to creativity,” Adrià said.
Despite Adrià’s ambitious project, he acknowledged that the Foundation will have a limited scope,
“People think you’re going to change everything—no. We have to focus on specific areas. This is a small project that cannot go all over the place,” Adrià said. “In life you must really know your limitations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A delegation of three custodians have lodged a protest Thursday over what they are calling “unnecessary” cuts in the number of hours worked.
The building manager was not in his office to receive the delegation.
Although the cuts were originally instituted in 2009, Thursday’s delegation was formed in response to the building manager’s request to reinstate some custodial hours on the morning shift without giving back extra hours on the evening shift.
Members of SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodial workers, said that the current hours plan is unsustainable.
“We feel that the reduced hour schedule is an unnecessary hardship on workers,” said Matthew Gulish, a member of SEIU Local 615. “It’s great that the building manager wants to reinstate the earlier hours, but we think the quality of the work would improve if he also reinstated the evening hours.”
Gulish said that the current system of reduced hours is an unfair and unmanageable strain on workers.
“People are getting paid less but are being pushed to work even harder than they have had to before,” Gulish said.
Guilsh also said that the significant gains in the endowment are adding to the union’s dissatisfaction with the current hours. The endowment gained 21.4 percent for fiscal year 2011, bringing its value up to $32 billion.
“We have felt even since the recession began that Harvard still has the resources to keep people employed and that none of these cuts are necessary,” Gulish said. “The new report has strengthened our argument. They’ve always had the money and the new report just reinforced that.”
Although the building manager was not in his office, Guilsh said that the mission was still a success.
“He wasn’t in his office, but it is important that we showed unity amongst ourselves,” Gulish said. “We plan on coming back until we can see the manager and get this issue resolved.”
The University declined to comment.
The complaint comes as Harvard custodians are negotiating a new contract with the University. One of the focal points of the campaign is increasing the number of hours and full time jobs for Harvard custodians. Leaders of Local 615 say that the protest should not negatively effect the negotiations.
This complaint also comes just as Harvard labor officials are preparing to present the findings of an investigation into reportedly “discriminatory” practices toward Harvard Law School custodians.

This story has been revised to reflect the following corrections.
CORRECTION: OCT. 16, 2011
The Oct. 14 article "Custodians Protest Cuts in the Number of Hours Worked" mistakenly identified UNICO as the contractor that provides custodians to the Divinity School. It is, in fact, Facilities Maintenance Operations. Additionally, the story misstated the number of custodians in the delegation. It was three, not ten.
CORRECTION: OCT. 18, 2011
The Oct. 14 aricle "Custodians Protest Cuts in the Number of Hours Worked" incorrectly stated that a delegation of Harvard custodians had lodged a protest against cuts in the number of hours worked at the Divinity School. But the Divinity School was not, in fact, a target of the complaint.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into Saturday’s non-league game against Bucknell, Harvard has yet to announce whether junior Colton Chapple or senior Collier Winters will start at quarterback.
Winters suffered a hamstring injury during the first game of the season. At the time, Winters suggested that he would only miss one or two games.
But Chapple, Winters’ backup at the beginning of the year, has started all three games since.
Both quarterbacks now appear to be healthy. But after Chapple’s stellar performance last week at Cornell—his 414 passing yards are the second-highest single-game total in program history—he might not be the backup anymore.
“It’s a great problem to have,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of having to choose between the two. “The alternative is that we don’t have the chance to be as successful as we might want to be when a guy goes down.”
Both Chapple and Murphy noted that practices this week have run differently. Normally, the starter for the upcoming weekend will take most of the number-one reps in practice, meaning that they take the majority of the snaps. But this week, Winters and Chapple have been splitting the snaps.
“Both Collier and I have played and won games for the program,” Chapple said. “We’re each getting a shot at starting this Saturday against Bucknell ... We played completely evenly during both practices, so whoever gets the nod on Saturday is going to be ready.”
Winters had an up-and-down game in his only start of the season. Against Holy Cross on Sept. 17, he threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns but also had two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown that gave Holy Cross a 16-point lead.
Murphy said in an interview before last Saturday’s game at Cornell that Winters would start as soon as he recovered from the injury. But since Chapple’s impressive performance, Murphy has indicated that the starting job is up in the air.
Winters has been Harvard’s starter since 2009, and it was widely assumed that he would continue to do so when he returned as a fifth-year senior in his final year of eligibility.
But even in the preseason, Chapple was on the radar to start, though Winters was a clear favorite.
“There’s been a lot of competition at the position, both in preseason and now during the season, and Colton’s just been very steady,” senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian said in an interview earlier this week. “He’s really taken command of the offense. He’s been making great decisions and making big plays.”
In 2010, then the third-string quarterback, Chapple filled in for an injured Winters early in the season as well, starting three games and going 2-1. Chapple is 5-1 in his career as a starter going into the weekend.
Chapple said the ongoing uncertainty has not had a significant impact on the dynamic of team practices, nor has it affected his relationship with Winters.
“You’ve got to respect [the coaches’] decision,” Chapple said. “They’re in the interest of winning, just like I am, just like I know Collier is ... I don’t believe it’s the cause of that much conflict between the team.”
Winters could not be reached for comment.
Murphy has discussed the possibility of using both Winters and Chapple, though he did not specify the roles they would play.
“It’s not outside the realm of possibility that we use two quarterbacks,” he said. “How and when depends on a lot of factors that you’re not going to really know about until you’re in the game.”
Harvard’s head coach has confronted situations in the past like the one he faces now. In 2002, Murphy had to choose between starting then-captain Neil Rose ’03 and Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05—two of the best quarterbacks in program history.
Murphy decided to start the sophomore in a number of the games that year, benching the team’s captain. Fitzpatrick is now the starting quarterback for the Buffalo Bills.
“There’s always decisions you have to make [and] you just can’t necessarily foresee them,” Murphy said. “I’ve been a head coach for 25 years—you do what’s best for the team, and you do what your gut tells you to do. And is your gut always right? No, but 80 percent of the time your gut gives you a chance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a colloquium hosted by the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review on Thursday, Columbia University Teachers College Professor Michael A. Rebell ’65 introduced his forthcoming article arguing for American children’s constitutional right to “comprehensive educational opportunity,” as the percentage of American children in families who live below the poverty line currently stands at 22 percent, one of the highest in the industrialized world.
In his article, Rebell discusses the challenge of closing the achievement gap in American education. He asserts that children ought to be provided certain services, including pre-natal care, preschool, health care, after-school care, and family support.
Thursday’s panel included Massachusetts Secretary of Education Paul Reville, who argued that solving this crisis in education is essential to improve the American economic climate.
“That which we ought to do morally becomes coincidental with that which we need to do economically,” Reville said.
Institute for Educational Leadership President Martin J. Blank emphasized that many sectors—including business, government, and higher education—must work together to provide these comprehensive educational opportunities to students.
“We keep going around in this country looking for simple answers to complex problems,” Blank said.
In addition to the panel discussion, members of the law community posted responses to Rebell’s article on the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Law Review website. Rebell expressed excitement about the interactive aspect of the program and said he was impressed that the commentators had to provide a 500 to 1,500 word essay as opposed to a brief comment about his work.
The Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Law Review also used live-blogging to involve those who could not attend the event. Alex S. Trepp, a second year Harvard Law School student, blogged throughout the entirety of the event.
“This is not only a platform to increase the profile of the event, but to engage in conversation,” Trepp said.
Lauren M. Weinstein, a third-year student at the Law School and editor-in-chief of the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Law Review, played a leading role in organizing the event. She said that the event would give Rebell an opportunity to present his argument and also to open conversation about challenges facing education in the U.S.
“Today is about moving the conversation forward,” she said.
Elayna M. Hecker-Thompson, a third-year Law School student and an editor of Rebell’s article, said she was happy with attendance at the event. She said she was especially glad that attendees came from a variety of Harvard schools, as the solution to closing the achievement gap in education will have to be a multi-disciplinary effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the University had recently appointed student representatives to a special committee to review the sexual misconduct policies of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, it has now decided to postpone soliciting student input in this process.
Citing a need to consult with the Office of the Assistant to the President and deans at schools across the University, OSAPR Director Sarah A. Rankin informed student members via email Thursday night that the committee would not immediately involve student participants.
Harvard’s decision to examine its sexual misconduct policies comes in the wake of a slew of complaints in the last year filed against institutions of higher education, including Harvard Law School and Yale University. Universities across the country have taken a closer look at their policies after the federal Office for Civil Rights rolled out stricter guidelines in April for handling sexual assault.
Given these recent events, Samantha A. Meier ’12, who intended to participate in the OSAPR review committee before Thursday’s reversal, called this year an “opportune time” for Harvard to take a look at its own policies.
The changes that may come out of the sexual assault policy review are still up in the air. Before learning that their involvement would be postponed, students appointed to the committee said that they hoped to discuss changing the definition of consent used by the Administrative Board and other University disciplinary bodies.
Under most legal definitions, forced sexual intercourse can be considered rape or sexual assault only when the victim said “no” or was incapable of doing so due to the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to Meier.
Meier said that she and other students on the committee hoped to push the University instead toward an “enthusiastic consent” model, in which an incident can be called rape in the absence of affirmative agreement.
“The only people who lose out in this model are the rapists,” said Lila S. Schreiber ’12, who had also intended to serve on the committee.
Meier said that she plans to discuss the stay on student involvement with Rankin, but she might eventually consider leading a “student protest” or “something more radical” than acting through administration-approved channels if she feels that student voices on this issue are not being heard.
Sexual assault policies fall under the purview of federal Title IX guidelines, a 1972 law which is most often associated with equal funding for women’s athletics but covers all types of sexual discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funding.
In the April letter, the OCR mandated a “preponderance of evidence” standard, which finds a student guilty if only 51 percent of the evidence points to that verdict, in contrast to the more stringent “burden of proof” standard which many universities use in sexual assault complaints.
The guidelines also require that colleges set up a system for investigating incidents promptly.
Last week, Yale University announced changes to its sexual assault policies, after the OCR began an investigation in April into what it termed the school’s “failure to eliminate a hostile sexual environment on campus.” According to the Yale Daily News, the changes include an expanded definition of sexual misconduct, a new Committee on Sexual Misconduct to handle cases, and mandatory training for student groups.
Meier expressed her hope that Harvard will let students discuss similar changes soon.
“We all care a lot about these issues,” she said, “and we want Harvard to care about these issues and take them seriously.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until Matt S. Brown ’14 walked into his first Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 26: “Race, Gender, and Performance” class in the first week of sophomore year, he says he was not aware that Harvard had a Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentration.
Brown says the course—taught by WGS Associate Professor Robin Bernstein—was highly recommended by his teammates on the football team, who described the class as “a breath of fresh air.”
Brown is among the growing ranks of non-concentrators taking WGS courses—a number that has jumped from 388 to 545 in the last two years. But despite the surge in enrollment numbers for WGS courses, the number of primary and joint concentrators has seen a much more gradual growth. As one of the College’s smallest concentrations approaches its 25th anniversary, the concentration still finds itself battling misconceptions about its nature.
“People think it’s only women, and that it’s just ‘crazy feminists,’” says Reed E. McConnell ’15, who is launching a feminist magazine at Harvard.
But feminism is only one focus of a department that has gradually taken on “the category of gender” as its field of study, according to Afsaneh Najmabadi, who chairs the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality. And as the discipline has broadened and diversified, so has the body of students who have chosen to study it.
FROM WOMEN’S STUDIES TO WGS
As academic fields go, WGS is a relative newcomer. Under the original title of “Women’s Studies,” the field first began to develop as a separate program in colleges and universities in the early 1970’s and found its way to Harvard in 1987.
Initially, Women’s Studies scholars primarily concerned themselves with the historical role of women in different societies and cultures, but it was not long before they began asking more fundamental questions about the concept of gender itself.
“The category of gender as the category of analysis developed into what became a redefinition of the field,” says Najmabadi.
Major shifts in scholarship continued with the gradual emergence of sexuality as an area of research in the 1980s, and with the rise of LGBTQ studies in the 1990s.
“By the time I arrived here [in 2001], if you went back and looked at course catalogs, the kinds of courses that were still what Women’s Studies was offering wasn’t really what the name connoted,” Najmabadi says. “It was not giving the right signal to the student body.”
According to Najmabadi, students would often approach the concentration late in their academic careers, saying that they would have chosen the field had they known it covered a broader area of scholarship that included gender and sexuality.
In 2003, the Committee on Women’s Studies petitioned to change its name to the Committee on Degrees in the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality—but still found itself suffering from popular misconceptions.
UNDERMINING STEREOTYPES
For its small size, the nature of its course offerings, and its unique academic approach, WGS has earned its concentrators a variety of stereotypes outside the classroom.
Sociology concentrator Samantha A. Meier ’12, who has taken a number of WGS classes, says she is acutely aware of how WGS concentrators are perceived around campus.
“There’s this idea that only people who already care about ‘women’ and ‘women’s issues’ would want to be WGS concentrators. That if you’re interested in the study of women, you probably are a woman, and it’s also probably your thing,” Meier says. “Gender is your thing and you can’t talk about anything else.”
Meier further describes how concentrators who identify as men are commonly assumed to be gay.
“The fact that it is ‘gender and sexuality’ leads people to believe that if you’re a guy interested in it, then probably your sexuality is not mainstream,” Meier says.
But while these stereotypes may reflect an element of truth, they do not encompass the full breadth of the discipline and the undergraduates who study it. It is true, however, that well more than half of the 19 junior and senior concentrators identify as female.
In addition, some concentrators agree that the focus on sexuality in the concentration does indeed attract students whose sexuality is “not mainstream” but say that the stereotypes regarding concentrator sexuality have become exaggerated.
“In terms of how [WGS concentrators] identify their sexual orientation, WGS is very diverse,” says Jia Hui Lee ’12, who identifies as queer.
What ties WGS concentrators together, however, is not just a spirit of feminism or interest in LGBTQ issues.
WGS concentrator Teake ’12 says that WGS has evolved from its roots in feminism to incorporate a broad spectrum of identity issues.
“It’s not just orientation that people bring to the table, but also maybe racial background or citizenship status,” he says. “People come to these classes to explore many, sometimes overlapping, issues of marginalization.”
MORE THAN A CONCENTRATION
Although the concentrators may vary in their use of identity as an academic lens, they attest to the way in which the WGS concentration facilitates a welcoming community.
By the end of four years, all the concentrators are quite familiar with one another, according to concentrator Keith W. Grubb ’13. Even WGS Director of Undergraduate Studies Caroline Light knows everyone by name.
“Our program’s faculty have worked over the years to provide a welcoming intellectual environment for all kinds of students,” Light says. “My hope is that people of all gender identities and orientations—not to mention races and ethnicities, class backgrounds, and nationalities—will recognize the value of gender and sexuality as categories of analysis.”
Lee describes the intimate nature of the concentration as one of its greatest strengths.
“It’s a very small community, so you do get a lot of personal attention with professors and your colleagues. You work together and think about questions together,” he says.
Concentrators say that WGS is different from other disciplines for the personal nature of the questions it asks about gender, race, and identity. For them, the open and tolerant way in which these questions are examined makes WGS a safe haven for individuals whose values and interests might otherwise be marginalized by traditional social constructs.
“It’s important to create a space where you’re not going to be ostracized,” Teake says. “I feel like a lot of people who do WGS are disillusioned that they can’t bring up these issues in other concentrations.”

For Harvard students in the 17th century, roasted lamb in the dining hall was a common fare, thanks to the prevalence of sheep in Cambridge 375 years ago.
But even though the sheep are now gone, the legs of lamb will be back at today’s dinner in celebration of Harvard’s 375th anniversary.
Whether a diner chooses to sip on a bowl of corn chowder or wolf down a leg of lamb with mint jelly, the Bill of Fare for the dinner will remind diners of Harvard’s culinary history.
“Our main guiding principles were to work from the menus from the 17th century through now that were borrowed from the archives, to choose dishes that we don’t normally find on the HUDS rotation and to include as many local and traditional ingredients as possible,” said Anne G. Douglas ’12, a member of a student committee in charge of developing the menu.
Chef Martin T. Breslin, HUDS director for culinary operations, said he received helpful feedback from the committee, which was composed of students involved in various food groups on campus, such as the Harvard College Culinary Society and the Food Literacy Project.
“We all eat in the dining hall, so it was a great collaborative discussion about what students like to eat,” he said.
The celebratory meal will start off with the Grand Sallat, a traditional Elizabethan salad whose recipe dates back to 1600s, as well as corn chowder and beef consommé.
The entrees include roast leg of lamb with mint jelly, chicken pie, and Welsh rarebit, an open-faced toast with a savory sauce of melted cheese and various other ingredients. The sides are buttered savory cabbage, English peas, griddled potatoes, and corn bread.
A root cellar—featuring a variety of root vegetables like turnips, carrots, beets, and parsnips—will take over the deli space in the servery.
Rebecca A. Ruskin ’13, president of the Culinary Society, said the committee spent some time developing a theme for the dinner.
“We wanted to pick things that we thought students would enjoy but would also be special and representative of Harvard’s history,” Ruskin said. “We also wanted to make sure there were things on the menu that would cater to everyone’s tastes.”
In the end, they decided to go for a traditionally themed meal that gives diners’ taste buds a retrospective look at Harvard over the past 375 years. The recipes for these dishes were collected from the archives at various Harvard libraries. Each committee member then chose one dish to research and wrote a paragraph describing it.
These placards will be printed and posted next to each dish on Friday at all upperclassman dining halls and Annenberg.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated at 3:00a.m. on 10/17/11
Journalist and author Fareed Zakaria did not wake up on time to hear the Class Day speech when he graduated from Yale College in 1986.
“I had celebrated quite a bit the night before,” he admitted in an interview with The Crimson on Friday.
Eight years later, after completing his Ph.D. in government at Harvard in 1993, Zakaria was once again unable to attend his Commencement ceremony—this time, because he had already started a job working in foreign affairs.
That summer, Zakaria received his Harvard diploma in the mail.
But on May 24, 2012, Zakaria—who is now editor-at-large of Time magazine—will be the principal speaker at Harvard’s 361st Commencement, the University announced Friday.
“There’s a Groucho Marx moment in that I don’t know that I would want to attend a Commencement speech given by myself,” he joked. “But I am enormously flattered and honored.”
After receiving a call from University President Drew G. Faust a few weeks ago inviting him to give the Commencement address, Zakaria said he “thought about it for about a nanosecond” before saying yes.
In his speech, Zakaria said he plans to “sketch the new world that we’re moving into” for Harvard graduates.
Zakaria explained that he intends to discuss what he calls the “rise of the rest”—the economic dynamism and political advancement of countries in Asia and Latin America during the 21st century.
The announcement of this year’s Commencement speaker—which traditionally comes at least several months later in the academic year—coincided with Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebrations.
“Harvard is an institution with a global reach, and the men and women who graduate next May will be going out into an increasingly interconnected world,” Faust said in a statement. “Fareed Zakaria is an unusually creative and incisive thinker in the realm of international affairs, and it will be a particular privilege to hear from him as Harvard looks toward the future from the vantage point of its 375th anniversary.”
Zakaria, who was born in India, also hosts Fareed Zakaria GPS, CNN’s flagship international relations television program, and was formerly a Newsweek columnist and editor of Newsweek International.
In 1999, Esquire Magazine described Zakaria as “the most influential foreign policy adviser of his generation.”
Zakaria described his seven years at Harvard as “the most intellectual experience of my life.”
For part of this time, Zakaria served as a nonresident tutor in Adams House.
Former dean of the Kennedy School of Government Joseph S. Nye called Zakaria “a terrific choice” for Commencement speaker.
Zakaria “has a deep love for America, but also the critical detachment from someone who has seen it from a distance as well as up close,” he said.
Nye, who was a professor of international affairs during Zakaria’s time as a graduate student at Harvard, recalls conversing with Zakaria about his thesis, remembering him as “a very serious scholar” who was “very interested in theory” and was among the “brightest of his cohorts.”
Although Nye said he expected Zakaria to touch on the problems facing the United States as it enters a phase of decline, he said he would not be surprised if Zakaria spoke about something entirely different.
“He’s a very original mind,” Nye said. “You never know what he’s going to say.”
Zakaria—who has also given graduation speeches at Brown University, Johns Hopkins University, and Yale University, among other institutions—said his role as a Commencement speaker reminds him of his age.
“I’ve always thought of myself as vaguely postgraduate. You no longer think of yourself as a bright young thing when you’re giving speeches to bright young things,” Zakaria said.
Zakaria—who is a member of the Yale Corporation—said he will be rooting for Yale at this year’s Harvard-Yale football game so as not to violate his fiduciary duties.
But if Harvard wins, he said, “I’ll be at the 50 yard line cheering them on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is hosting this weekend.  Football, men’s soccer, men’s water polo, women’s soccer and women’s volleyball are all taking on their opponents at home.  Good news, Crimson fans, you don’t have to travel far to see your teams play.  And as for our visiting opponents, we like to make you feel welcome too.
Dear Bucknell, Brown, Columbia,  Connecticut College, Mercyhurst and St. Francis players: stick around another day.  Here are the two major events happening on Harvard’s campus this weekend:
1.  Freshmen Parents’ Weekend
Freshmen parents will descend on campus to visit their sons and daughters.  Yes, it will be annoyingly crowded, but there are perks to Parents’ Weekend too.  Harvard will be stepping up its game: above-average food in Annenberg, tidy dorm rooms and a rare Mankiw Ec10 lecture.
2. Harvard’s 375th Anniversary
Who doesn’t like talking trees, free T-shirts, Yo-Yo Ma and a cake big enough to feed 4,000 people?
Football fans, here’s what you won’t be missing this weekend at Bucknell:
1. Antiquing
“Antiquing” is listed as one of the top ten things to do in Lewisburg, Penn., the home of the Bucknell Bisons.  If antiquing made it onto the top ten list, you should be afraid… very afraid.
2. Enough said.
In conclusion, thank your lucky stars that you are staying close to home this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon arriving in Cambridge in the spring of 2007, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker made a big decision: he no longer wanted the Crimson to be a typical Ivy League basketball team.
Instead, Amaker wanted to turn his program into something more, to act like a big-time player in a sport where underdogs struggle to build consistent success.
His team has recently proved itself capable of competing at a high level. In the past two years—its two most successful seasons ever—Amaker’s squad has received Associated Press top-25 votes, knocked off schools from BCS conferences, and won its first-ever Ivy League title.
The coach has also attempted to recruit at a level that Ivy schools have rarely dared to venture into, reaching out to some of the nation’s premier high school players and convincing them to consider Harvard along with national powerhouses like UConn, Kansas, and Florida.
And now, Amaker is bringing a sacred college basketball tradition, that of Midnight Madness, to Cambridge.
Midnight Madness is an annual event that celebrates the first day the NCAA permits formal practices for the upcoming season. The custom started at the University of Maryland on Oct.15, 1971, with a midnight run by Terrapins head coach Lefty Driesell.
Exactly forty years later, the Crimson will begin its own tradition. The festivities, which begin at Lavieties Pavilion at 4 p.m., will include a team scrimmage and the raising of Harvard’s first-ever Ivy League championship banner.
“We’ve always been interested in trying to grow our program in different ways,” Amaker said. “We thought if we could somehow have our first ever intra-squad scrimmage, call it the Crimson Madness, and be able to unveil our first-ever banner—which is kind of historic in its own right ... We thought it would be a neat concept, and we’re very hopeful we can get a lot of people to come out and participate in this historic day for us.”
Many schools literally schedule their “madness” event at midnight—the very first moment practices are allowed. Amaker said that was something he considered, but he wanted his players to have the chance to partake in Harvard’s 375th anniversary celebration on Friday night. Last year, the coach passed up the chance for an opening night practice and instead brought his players to see a speech by Secretary of Education—and former Crimson basketball co-captain—Arne Duncan ’87.
But with Harvard’s increased success on the court of late, student attendance and interest in the program has grown, making it clear that this year was as good as any to start a new tradition.
“It’s been so exciting for me,” Amaker said. “When I have students and fans say to me how much they enjoy coming to games and seeing the kids play, how much fun it is ... That’s meaningful to me because we always want to play in a way where our students and fans can be a part of that with us.”
Since taking the Harvard job, Amaker—who previously coached at Michigan and Seton Hall—has been active in attempting to increase student involvement with the basketball program. Last year, he helped organize fan buses to bring students to New Haven for the Crimson’s game against Yale, and this season, he has reached out to student groups such as the Kuumba Singers to sing the national anthem and participate in halftime events.
“I value being a part of this campus, not just being the basketball coach,” Amaker said. “There’s so many wonderful people and events and organizations and clubs and different things that go on. We’re excited to know that maybe our Harvard basketball team can be included in that long list of neat things that happen here ... If there’s an opportunity to have our students engaged, I’m interested.”
Amaker’s players are also excited about the opportunity to partake in the first-ever event of this type at Harvard.
“It’s going to be fun,” co-captain Keith Wright said. “After making history with the first Ivy League title, we’re making history with the first Crimson Madness. It’s going to be awesome to have everyone come out and show support for Harvard basketball.”
But to Amaker—who Wright said was the driving force behind the event—the value of Crimson Madness will go beyond garnering excitement about the team’s play on the court.
“It’s more in-line with the student experience,” Amaker said. “Being engaged with things that are happening, supporting each other ... I think that’s the unique thing about being here. There’s so much that happens, so much teaching that goes on outside the classroom, outside the textbook. We thrive on that at Harvard. This can be another way we do that. It’s not just about coming to an athletic event; it’s about being engaged with student life at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team will step onto the fairways and greens of the Boston Golf Club in Hingham, Mass., Saturday to host the Harvard Invitational in what will be the squad’s final competition of the fall season.
After its ninth-place finish out of 15 competitors in the Nittany Lion Invitational held by Penn State last weekend, Harvard plans to take advantage of the chance to resume its winning ways.
“[Penn State] was not what we hoped,” Rhoads said. “We were short on practice that week ... there was a lot going on. We had a little bit more preparation in between, and the girls are motivated.”
Prior to its relatively poor finish in Pennsylvania, the Crimson had opened its 2011-12 campaign with two consecutive tournament victories. It has worked hard in practice this week with the intention of getting back on track.
“[Penn State] helped us prepare for [the Harvard Invitational],” freshman Tiffany Lim said. “We didn’t play so well, so it really motivated us to work harder this week. We’ve been really grinding it out this week.”
Lim, the nation’s sixth-ranked incoming freshman according to Golf Magazine, will attempt to medal this weekend, as she previously did at the Yale and Princeton Invitationals, where she took first place in both. Captain Christine Cho, senior Jane Lee, sophomore Bonnie Hu—a member of The Crimson business board—and freshman Brenna Nelsen will likely round out the golfers for Harvard, which has already faced a number of the other Ivy schools so far this season and come out on top.
At the Yale Invitational on Sept. 17, the Crimson took first out of 15 teams—which included the hosts, who came fourth, and Brown, who finished sixth. Harvard also topped the Bears, Columbia, Dartmouth, and the host Tigers at the Princeton Invitational a week later. But this weekend will present the first opportunity for the Crimson to see all of the Ancient Eight’s squads in action on the same course and measure itself accordingly.
“This is an Ivy-only event,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Cornell doesn’t have a women’s team, so the seven Ivy women’s programs will be there. It’s an additional motivation; it’s kind of a fall preview as to where the Ivies stack up.”
“It’s a chance to see where we compare to the other Ivy teams,” Rhoads added. “The other teams are very competitive as well, so if we slip a little bit, the other teams can slip in and fill the spot we’ve been in this fall.”
Although the invitational is technically considered a home meet, the Boston Golf Club, located 18 miles south of Boston, is not the Crimson’s home course. The fact that Harvard has played on the course should not provide too much of an advantage over its league rivals.
“It’s a really nice course, [but] we don’t get to play there that often,” Cho said. “The course is really tricky, and we’ll have to be really sharp going into it.”
Rhoads echoed his captain’s concerns.
“It’s a great golf course, but it’s a hard golf course, so the sharper we are, the easier it will make it,” Rhoads said. “If you’re a little not sharp on this golf course, it will magnify your errors.”
Weather should not be an issue, as the forecast predicts clear skies. The recent rain may make the course a bit soggy, but the Crimson now has experience with poor conditions after dealing with precipitation at Penn State, where the competition’s final round had to be canceled due to unplayable conditions on the course.“
"The last tournament we played in was really helpful for this tournament, because the weather at the last tournament was really bad,” Cho said. “At least if it does rain, [we’ve] had [Penn State] to prepare.”
The team remains optimistic moving forward into the weekend tournament and the upcoming spring season.
“I’m confident in where we are,” Rhoads said.  “I think that we’ve been moving in a good direction in the past week and a half or so in between Penn State and now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last day of baseball’s spring training, teams finalize the starting rotation before opening day.
Before the Masters, golfers practice their short game at Augusta National’s famous par-three course.
Before a wedding, you have a rehearsal dinner—but that’s basically so you don’t forget the names of your in-laws.
That’s where we are in the Ivy League. Welcome to tune-up week.
Sure, every team in the Ancient Eight has played some meaningful games so far.
But those games have been interspersed with other matchups against non-league opponents.
This week, teams will have a chance to work out the last few kinks in their game plans and solve any lingering concerns on the roster. Because from here on out, it’s all Ivy.
Harvard, Dartmouth, Cornell, and Yale take on opponents from outside the Ancient Eight.
The other four teams in the league are already finished with their non-league games.
Well, you may ask, how are these other two games not important? Surely they mean something.
The two league games: Princeton versus Brown and Penn versus Columbia.
Princeton and Columbia are basically out of it already. And for the Bears and the Quakers?
Like I said, it’s tune-up week.
Though the four non-league games don’t have direct implications for the title hunt, they should still tell us a lot about how these teams will fare for the rest of the season.
After a heart-breaker against Penn, Dartmouth looked poised to make a dark-horse run at the crown.
Then it visited New Haven, where Yale proceeded to blow the Big Green out, 30-0.
But the biggest question of all is in Cambridge.
Junior Colton Chapple threw his way into the record book with a 414-yard game against the Big Red.
Even so, he still might not be the starter tomorrow. Senior Collier Winters, who hasn’t played since game one, might get the nod.
Harvard might be the mid-season Ivy League favorite, but we still don’t know who will be taking snaps down the stretch.
PRINCETON (1-3, 1-0 Ivy) at BROWN (3-1, 0-1)
Last week, Kyle Newhall-Caballero reasserted himself as an Ivy League threat, completing 25-of-39 passes and throwing for 229 yards and two touchdowns for Brown.
The ground game is a clear concern for the Bears, who ran for just 99 yards last week and have only 428 yards all season as a team.
Princeton actually put up solid numbers last week, rushing for 256 yards as a team, and the Tigers were within one point early in the fourth quarter. But Hampton isn’t the strongest team around, and Princeton couldn’t rally at the end.
That the Tigers have an Ivy League win already this season is nothing more than a fluke of scheduling that allows them to play Columbia in the first game of the year.
Brown shouldn’t have any problem taking this one.
Pick: Brown 31, Princeton 20
DARTMOUTH (1-3, 0-2 Ivy) at HOLY CROSS (2-3, 1-0 Patriot)
Oh, Dartmouth. You disappoint me. First, I picked you to beat Penn in my early Ivy-upset selection.
You couldn’t, but, hey, you made it close.
Then, I thought, you played so well against the Quakers that you should be able to take on Yale.
Nope. The 30-0 loss to the Bulldogs was never close.
And I’ve seen just how good a team Holy Cross can be. Even though the Crusaders lost to Brown last week, quarterback Ryan Taggart is a serious offensive threat and has the ability to change a game’s dynamic when he’s on.
Even in last week’s loss, he still completed 27 passes for 243 yards.
It probably goes without saying, but the Big Green was terrible last week. Nick Schwieger, the reigning Ivy League co-MVP, was limited to just 39 total yards.
Dartmouth just isn’t playing well enough right now. And if they win, I’ll know it’s just a conspiracy to prove my picks wrong.
Pick: Holy Cross 24, Dartmouth 17
CORNELL (2-2, 0-2 Ivy) at COLGATE (3-3, 1-1 Patriot)
Cornell isn’t the punching bag of the Ivy League anymore. Far from it, in fact.
Even though the Big Red already has two losses in league play so far, more or less taking the team out of serious title contention, it could still definitely be a player.
Sophomore quarterback Jeff Mathews, for one, is one of the most talented passers in the league, and he’s only getting better.
Colgate is on a two-game win streak, but its 3-3 record so far this season might be a little misleading. Its last two wins have come against Fordham and Monmouth, neither of whom is exactly a powerhouse kind of team.
In early September, the Raiders were blown out by Holy Cross, 37-7.
Cornell may not be making a title run—yet—but it hasn’t lost a non-league game this year. Too bad those don’t really mean much.
Pick: Cornell 28, Colgate 24
PENN (2-2, 1-0 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (0-4, 0-1)
Penn was the preseason Ivy League favorite. Columbia hasn’t won since last November.
Penn is on a two-game winning streak. Freshmen at Columbia have seen more hurricanes than Lions’ wins.
The Quakers definitely struggled early in the season.
But it looks like Penn has regained its composure. Really, this one shouldn’t be close.
Pick: Penn 38, Columbia 10
YALE (3-1, 2-0 Ivy) at LAFAYETTE (1-4, 0-1 Patriot)
Though we haven’t reached the heart of the Ivy League season yet, a few clear leaders have started emerging. And Yale is definitely one of them.
The Bulldogs have cruised in three of its four wins this season, scoring no fewer than 30 points in any of its victories.
Its only loss came on the road against Lehigh, a ranked FCS team.
Its win over Dartmouth last week was nothing short of dominant, scoring 13 points in the first quarter and never looking back en route to a shutout.
Lafayette hasn’t played since Harvard crushed the Leopards two weeks ago.
While the team is talented, it also committed a ton of mistakes that included defensive errors and a number of personal fouls.
At this point, I think that the Bulldogs are too talented, and unless Lafayette has really figured something out, this one is Yale’s to lose.
Pick: Yale 31, Lafayette 23
BUCKNELL (4-2, 1-1 Patriot) at HARVARD (3-1, 2-0 Ivy)
Harvard, in the last three weeks, has looked like a really good team, in large part to stellar play from Chapple.
And we still don’t know who will start tomorrow.
Winters hasn’t appeared since week one, so if he starts, who knows what we can expect. If he returns to mid-season form from 2010, the Crimson might be set.
If he plays like he did against Holy Cross week one, it could be a long day.
Either way, Bucknell is a tough football team, though its win-loss record might be deceptive.
One of the team’s losses came at Cornell, a 24-13 defeat. The Bisons led late in the third quarter but weren’t able to hold on.
It’s tough to make a pick when I don’t know who will be taking the snaps. But Bucknell’s loss against Cornell shows some vulnerability.
Then again, the commutative property doesn’t hold in the sporting world.
Pick: Harvard 35, Bucknell 27
RECORD LAST WEEK: 4-2 (To date: 8-4)

Picture a sleepy Sunday afternoon in Harvard Yard. There are a few people on the steps of Widener catching up on last week's reading. Freshman trickle back to their dorms from a Sunday brunch of Veritaffles. And then comes Julie C. Woods '81, and the silence is broken with the rhythmic sounds of her djembe.
"I wanted to say my drum prayers," said Woods, who was on campus after attending her 30th reunion. Today, she has the title of the Urban Bliss Shaman.
"I wanted to do a blessing and pull all the disparate pieces of my life together," Woods said.
For Woods, Harvard has been one of those disparate pieces as long as she can remember.
"I think the first word I ever read was Harvard, on the side of my mom's books," she said. Her mother, Althea L. Woods, received her M.Ed. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1955.
"I wanted to come [to Harvard] because I wanted to make my mom proud," Woods said. "There aren't that many 51-year-old women who are second generation black female from Harvard. I'm now really proud of that."
Still, at 17, Woods said, her reasons for coming to Harvard had to do in part with an attempt to avoid living in her mother's shadow.
"They're wonderful people," she said of her parents, "but I really needed out. I couldn't do anything in LA. I had to get out so I could misbehave."
While at Harvard, Woods found an outlet through music.
"Music is woven into my life and it's woven into my history at Harvard," Woods said.
Today, she continues to sing and play the djembe and guitar as part of her work as an urban shaman. A self-described griot (a storyteller in the West African tradition), her stories and insights about the Harvard experience across generations are perhaps best when left to speak for themselves.
This post has been revised to reflect the following the corrections:
CORRECTION: October 17, 2011
An earlier version of the October 14 post "An Interview with the Urban Bliss Shaman" misstated the reason for Woods' presence on campus. She was, in fact, on campus for her 30th reunion.

With music by Yo-Yo Ma, a 15 ft. by 18 ft. cake, talking trees, and the Widener steps all lit up, it's no secret that fair Harvard is going all out for tonight's festivities. But did you know that it's green not crimson, that's in at Harvard's 375th?
Nothing is expected to be wasted during tonight's festivities, thanks to careful planning by the Harvard University Dining Service, Recycling and Waste Services, and the Harvard Office of Sustainability.
"The police want a zero crime rate, firefighters want zero fires, and we want zero waste," said Rob M. Gogan, Jr., Harvard's recycling and waste manager.
Not only will desserts be served in recyclable dishware, all the leftovers from the night will be composted, according to Gogan. Keep an eye out for the 120 recycling stations located at major vantage points as well as at all entrances to the yard: green-lids are for composting leftovers and dishes and blue-lids will be for recycling paper, glass, plastic, and cans.
