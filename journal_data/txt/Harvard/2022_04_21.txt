After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By now, most pop culture and music fans know that the Korean pop icons BTS recently visited the U.S. After their explosive performance at the 64th Grammy Awards earlier this month, the K-pop sensations took to the sold-out Allegiant Stadium stage in Las Vegas for three back-to-back days of “Permission To Dance On Stage” (or “PTD”) performances.
Although they did not win the Grammy for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, the band made it clear that the awards ceremony just a pit stop onto the real destination for their trip: “We didn’t come to Vegas for the Grammys. We came to Vegas for the ARMYs,” band leader RM said during their April 9 performance. “PTD” follows a previous series of four Los Angeles-based concerts in November and December of 2021. Despite their residency lasting only four days, these concerts were so wildly popular that they achieved the biggest single-venue concert engagement by any act in almost a decade.
Amid a hectic and record-breaking year for the seven members — RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, and Jungkook — they concluded their “PTD” tour with a new album announcement. The first teaser came at the conclusion of their final concert on April 16, when RM exited the stage with the phrase “We Are Bulletproof” — the name of the 18th track from their 2020 “Map of the Soul: 7” album. These words were immediately followed by a black-and-white montage that featured the group’s previous albums. The 50-second video concluded with a date: June 10, 2022.
Sure enough, mere seconds after the announcement, BTS’s fanbase — nicknamed ARMY — blew up Twitter with trending hashtags like “BTS Is Coming.” Known for their keen perception when it comes to connecting BTS easter eggs, ARMYs cracked the code in no time at all. They were convinced a new album announcement had been made hours before BTS’ management, Big Hit Music, would officially confirm the release on WeVerse. Some fans even went so far as to use clips from BTS’s 2015 music video “RUN” to crack the mathematical code behind the album’s release date.
While Big Hit Music has yet to release any further information about the upcoming release, that hasn’t deterred ARMYs from making their own predictions. Proposed hypotheses include that the name of the album will be “WE” to reflect “ME,” and that the album’s cover will be purple to symbolize BTS’s growth.
Whatever the future may bring, BTS is sure to have their loyal ARMYs at their back — no matter which color they pick for their cover art.

New Zealand pop star Lorde has undergone a renaissance since the last time she performed in Boston in 2018. It all started in the aftermath of her sophomore album “Melodrama” and the subsequent world tour to promote the project. After months spent on the road following the release of the critically-acclaimed album that cemented her auteur status, the singer retreated from the music world and “went back to living [her] life,” as she told The New York Times in an August 2021 interview. During this self-imposed sabbatical, she turned to the natural world, sunlight, and domesticity, and it was there that she found her inspiration for her latest album, 2021’s “Solar Power.”
Now, Lorde is on a world tour in support of the album that has seen her on the road since her April 3 show in Nashville and will last all the way until March 2023 in Perth, Australia. She stopped at the Boch Center’s Wang Theater in Boston on April 12 for a show that established her as a pop icon dedicated to craft, meaning, and connection above all else. Every decision that went into the crafting of the performance — from the deceptively simple stage design to her fluorescent outfits — could only be described as intentional, conveying the image of an artist who knows exactly what she’s doing and why she’s doing it.
Though lighter-sounding and more thematically nuanced than her past works (2017’s “Melodrama” and 2013’s “Pure Heroine” are both driven by the insatiable cravings of youth), “Solar Power” showcases an artist at her best. No longer is Lorde bound to create and recreate “all the music you loved at 16,” as she sings in her self-reflective single “Stoned at the Nail Salon.” Instead, she deftly explores the climate crisis (and the fragile state of the future), satirizes white new-age wellness culture, and breaks down deep insecurities over the course of the 12-track album. Her sonic and thematic maturity is disarming throughout. All this was on full display at the Wang Theater.
The night began with opener Remi Wolf, who commanded the theater stage with her signature funk pop sound and relentlessly powerful vocals. She played hits like the mega-popular “Photo ID,” as well as tracks from her latest album (“Juno”) like “Liquor Store” and “Volkiano.” Though the set was not nearly long enough to capture the many highs of Wolf’s repertoire, it showcased her immense talent and provided a hint of what’s to come with her upcoming tour, which will see her in Boston again on Oct. 9.
Lorde first appeared behind a screen, her silhouette hidden as she sang along to an instrumental rendition of “Leaders of a New Regime,” from “Solar Power.” The theatrical entrance set the tone for the night: Lorde made every song a mini performance, complete with unique set design and staging. In between songs, the stage became cloaked in darkness as she and her band assumed positions for the next one. With each new lighting scheme or change to the set — which was made up of a diagonal staircase and a drum-like cylinder on a rotating floor — it was clear that the goal was beauty. Like the songs in “Solar Power,” Lorde’s show was concerned primarily with taking advantage of and amplifying the power and simplicity in the organic.
Throughout the show, the “Green Light” singer didn’t set aside her older music — despite how much her sound has evolved over the years — but was rather spurred on by it. “I wrote this song when I was 15, which means that some of you have been listening to it for 10 years. But tonight, I want us to dance for our 15-year old selves,” she said before breaking out into an updated mix of “Ribs.” She lent the “Pure Heroine” single a timeless glow as she jumped and danced across the stage. Though the majority of the night’s setlist was made up of songs from “Solar Power” — from the ethereal melancholy of “Fallen Fruit” to the confessional and grooving “Secrets From a Girl (Who’s Seen It All)” — her older work was allowed substantial space in the limelight, much to the benefit of long-term fans. The haunting “Buzzcut Season,” impossibly fun “Supercut,” and intimate stylings of “The Louvre” were all highlights of a night filled to the brim with artistry, and each produced thunderous roars of applause. As such, songs from “Pure Heroine” and “Melodrama” became a catalog revamped. Positioned in contrast to the musings of “Solar Power,” her older cuts took on new life.
“It’s funny doing these shows, it's sort of like having a friend who lives overseas… Everytime you see each other it’s like no time has passed, you know that type of friendship?” Lorde said during a more introspective moment in the show, bookended by “Ribs” and “Solar Power”’s “Big Star.” “I love sitting here with you. I love nothing more in the world than doing this,” she said. And indeed, such a statement rang true. The care she devoted to her audience, asking about new boyfriends and new breakups among other things, washed over her entire performance.
By the time the show ended, Lorde had taken her fans on an expansive tour of her discography. And with every aspect of the show being so carefully executed, from the choreography to the lighting, there was an undeniable artistry inherent to every single movement. “Royals” and “Team” — both hit singles from “Pure Heroine” — served as the show’s encores, reminding Lorde’s audience yet again of the incredible evolution she’s undergone as a singer-songwriter over the years, all the while serving as a testament to her unprecedented beginnings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a hiatus brought on by Covid-19, Dorm Crew is finally back! Well, sort of. In its new, post-Covid iteration, instead of hiring students to clean dorm bathrooms as it has for nearly 70 years, Dorm Crew will now hire students to do audiovisual work for houses and classrooms under the Education Support Services framework. We’re not quite sure what to call it now — Audiovisual Crew just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
While it is hard to imagine a Dorm Crew outside of cleaning dorm bathrooms, Dorm Crew has always been more than just a service that employs students to clean bathrooms. For what some may consider a service that emphasized economic inequalities at Harvard by hiring students to perform custodial work for their peers, students that actually participated in Dorm Crew did not see it as such. The Crimson reported an email from Guillaume Bouchard ’23- ’24, in which they wrote that “I met there some of the most down-to-earth, genuine people I’ve known in my time at Harvard.” Rather than feeling exploited, former Dorm Crew employees characterized their experiences with Dorm Crew as joining a community of hardworking and like-minded peers that helped start their semesters on a high note.
Indeed, while people, such as members of this Editorial Board in the past, have editorialized Dorm Crew to be a problematic organization that takes advantage of pre-existing inequalities, the students that are being “exploited” have spoken only of the contrary. Critics of Dorm Crew may come from a genuine place of concern for lower-income students performing what they perceive as degrading labor. To this, we want to make clear that manual labor is never inherently demeaning or lesser than the middle-management jobs that many Harvard students will go on to have, or the academic work that we constantly engage in at this College. Manual laborers such as custodians deserve respect — respect for the values that their work contributes and the respect of not being subjected to classist and elitist preconceived notions of worth that seek to victimize them.
Precisely because Dorm Crew has been so great in its original form, we are slightly concerned about its new form. For one, we are worried about the lesser number of students Dorm Crew (the AV Crew?) will now be able to hire in comparison to previous numbers of more than 800 students.
The work that Dorm Crew and workers at Harvard contribute is meaningful and essential to our community and campus, without which we would suffer. For this, we are very thankful. We also maintain that students should take charge in maintaining the cleanliness of their own spaces on campus as well, especially now that Dorm Crew no longer offers dorm cleaning services. After all, we all share this campus and its residential spaces. Students should do this on their own, but houses should consider launching their own programs like Dorm Crew. As former Dorm Crew employees can attest, working together to perform manual tasks can build and strengthen communities that go beyond lip service — something that houses desperately need after the social isolation brought on by Covid-19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m writing this in the cool night after my fever has broken. In these few moments of clarity I get — from the physical pain and the mental — I spiral into existential crisis.
I know that, in all reality, Covid-19 will soon pass me by and slide into the archives of wacky stories for me to tell when I get better. I know that in a week or so from now, I will be testing negative, taking finals, and grousing about how annoying it is to run between all my classes. I know that I am not the demographic to die to this. I am young, and approximately healthy, and with access to enough painkillers and vitamins to take out a horse.
I know I will be fine. It’s just that, before I slid the key into the lock of my room for what I didn’t realize until too late was the last free time in a while, before I had to question whether my nasty headache was from stress or lack of sleep or — surprise third option! — Covid, before the rapid test bled into two red lines and I sent my parents the “I think I have Covid” panic text with two minutes left on the timer, I thought I was immune.
Now, I am confronted with the fact that I am not only very mortal and susceptible to infectious disease, but also excruciatingly fragile. Six walls and a window that gets dark too early is enough to do me in. I’m a lab rat in a cage, but at least they get wheels to run on. I’m afraid of doors now. Isn’t that pathetic?
Many have written before on Harvard’s unsatisfactory spring 2022 Covid-19 isolation policy. I should know firsthand how unsatisfactory it is; I’ve dealt with every stage of it. Eighteen Chrome tabs open trying to figure out which Harvard websites are up-to-date with the new policy. The second email with additional guidance on how to isolate in place that the HUHS Contact Tracing Team promises me but never delivers. The day the Isolation Dining Pick-Up station in Kirkland House runs out of all bottled water except sparkling, so I, dehydrated and half-delirious, pour myself cups of hot water that taste faintly of coffee grounds.
Yet, what scares me most about Harvard’s isolation policy is me. As I see it, my potential to harm all the healthy, non-infected, unknowing people just happily walking around campus is massive. I venture outside my disease incubator of a room once a day to drop off a Covid test and pick up dinner from Kirkland. Every time, I want to scream at everyone I encounter: I’m a contagion! Get away from me! Put your masks on and run in the opposite direction! It’s insane that I am allowed to walk on the street amongst people who are none the wiser, stifling coughs in my double-layered masks while they turn and chat.
At the same time, I selfishly don’t want to brand myself as Covid-positive so that people veer away from me. Isolation is lonely enough. The emotional toll of being stuck in a box for days has opened my waterworks and won’t let them close. I feel it, that terrible lump of emotion and twitch of tears, whenever I get a scrap of human connection. The first time a friend called me and I picked up, I spent all 30 minutes of that call sobbing into the phone. I burst into tears at a club meeting over Google Meet, of all things.
I know my fear of infecting other people on the street, of turning them as weak and transient as I currently feel, is largely irrational. I would have to spend 15 or more minutes with anyone indoors for them to be considered a close contact at risk of contracting Covid-19 from me. But I am not a scientist with an innate understanding of my infectious period. I only know that it feels ethically wrong for me to be able to place other people in potential harm’s way, without their knowledge. It scares me how thin the barriers to known, intentional harm are. It scares me that Harvard is banking their isolation policy on the brittle moral weighings of people who are already much too fragile from Covid.
I miss outside. I miss Eliot dining hall, and lying on friends’ carpets, and unmasked laughter. I miss normalcy. If Harvard’s Covid years saw time freeze, isolation is the most hellish version of that. But come the end of my day five, I will follow the isolation policy to the best of my ability. If I’m still symptomatic, I’m locking myself in here again. This will harm me, no doubt. But crucially, I do not want to harm other people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve always been interested in fashion. For as long as I can remember, I’ve flipped through fashion magazines, ripping out pages to save my favorite looks. I started sewing clothes when I was nine, began making my own designs when I was about 12, and never stopped. I’d proudly walk the halls of my high school in my latest designs, and even now, when people comment on my outfits, I’ll often reply with “Thanks, I made it!” I love fashion—it sustains me, it allows me to express myself, and the clothes I make and wear help me to feel confident and beautiful. Thus, when I was a senior in high school, choosing a college to attend, it was essential that the school I went to had some way for me to get involved in fashion on campus.
Harvard is not exactly known as a hub for fashion. This year, I am enrolled in one of only two fashion classes that have been taught at the College in recent years. There is an overwhelming lack of institutional support for students who are interested in fashion as an academic or career path, but students are working to overcome this by creating their own spaces for fashion on campus. I am a member of FIG Magazine, Harvard’s first fashion publication, which was founded in 2018 to create a diverse space for Harvard students interested in fashion. I am also the founding Editorial Director of the Lavender Room, an upcoming BIPOC fashion and arts publication. My dream is to run a fashion magazine, and both of these organizations have given me the opportunity to build skills and create work in alignment with that dream.
Fashion organizations at Harvard are essential spaces for students who are interested in fashion and the arts, and none have been around longer than Eleganza, which was founded in 1994 by cultural production organization Black C.A.S.T. Eleganza’s annual show is Harvard’s largest student-run event, and it provides an opportunity for a diverse cast of students to celebrate expression through fashion and dance. I watched last year’s virtual show, and was impressed by the high production value, vibrant dances, and beautiful outfits. The 2022 show takes place next Saturday, April 23, and I am so excited to attend my first in-person Eleganza.
I had the opportunity to speak with Eleganza’s Executive Producer in charge of Fashion, Finance, and Publicity, Salena Prakah-Asante ’23, and she explained that since its founding, Eleganza’s mission was to focus on Black representation, as well as diversity and inclusion more generally. This diversity is reflected not only among the show’s cast of models and dancers, but also in the featured brands and designers. While Black people make up 13.4 percent of the United States population, we account for only about 4 percent of American designers. Shows like Eleganza are trying to change that by highlighting the diverse work of Black designers and brands, including FUBU, Washington Ave, Bless by Bless, House of Aama, and Savage X Fenty, among others.
Prakah-Asante described some of the challenges that Black designers face, including the fact that Black designers are often not taken seriously, and many are “siloed into the streetwear area, because that’s just something that in media and entertainment, we really associate with Black creativity.” Brands like Savage X Fenty are doing creative and transformational work in the fashion industry, in “showcasing the diverse range of bodies and faces that we have through their shoots and through their website.”
Diversity in fashion is more than a numbers game or a PR stunt; it’s important to represent a wide range of identities and experiences within the fashion industry because, as Prakah-Asante explains, “Fashion is not this kind of superficial thing where we’re just putting together outfits or trying to make ourselves look nice, it’s really a full industry that is so integrated into people’s lives.” For me, the clothes I wear reflect my family history, my Black and queer identities, my approach to art, and my definintion of beauty. I think many others would say the same, and Prakah-Asante hopes that Eleganza attendees will reflect on their personal relationships with fashion and fashion brands.
Salena Prakah-Asante says that fashion has always been an important part of her life, and that Eleganza was one of the reasons she decided to attend Harvard. “I think seeing the level of creativity and freedom of expression on stage when I was visiting pre-frosh really excited me,” she said.
Fashion is an integral part of so many people’s lives, and Eleganza helps to show that there is a space at Harvard for people who value fashion. The show takes place during Visitas each year, and it helps expose incoming freshmen to the amazing creative community that exists at this institution.

Martha H. Mauzy — a co-chair of the Cambridge Plant and Garden Club Committee of Garden History and Design — says that the garden club is so much more than just “ladies in white gloves arranging peonies.” The more than 130-year-old nonprofit organization is a community that both shares a love for gardening and advocates for conservation in the Cambridge area. For example, they have spent decades protecting the sycamore trees by the Charles River from being cut down to make way for infrastructure.
Mauzy stresses that the club is “very active about protecting open space.” She adds: “We’re a small little club, but we’ve always had a public-facing mission, which is to try to make things nice in Cambridge for those of us who live here.”
One of their most recent projects encompassing these goals is the “Cambridge Community Gardens Today” book, produced by the club’s Garden History and Design committee. This publication showcases Cambridge’s 14 community gardens — their histories, plot layouts, gardeners, and plants. These community gardens are open to all Cambridge residents who rank their top three plot choices in an application.
Compiling the book took two years. The club worked closely with Jennifer K. Letourneau, the Cambridge Community Gardens project coordinator, who met with the team every month for over a year and helped them reach out to individual gardeners. The book also draws from the work of Catherine M. Fleming, a former Harvard graduate student whose 1996 research paper proved useful in telling the early history of these gardens. Her work explains how people moving from industrial England to a crowded Cambridge wanted to continue the English tradition of community gardens with individual plots.
One of the club members biked across town, taking pictures of all 14 gardens on her iPad. The club also hired a drone photographer to take overhead photos to show how the gardens fit into the larger surrounding community.
But for Mauzy, the people behind the plots are what ultimately make the read so compelling. “What makes this book is the gardeners,” Mauzy says. She adds: “The point of the book is to show the diversity and the skill and the love that these different people all throughout Cambridge have in these little plots.”
Through the gardeners, the garden club also got to know about the variety of plants grown in the community gardens themselves. Mauzy says one of her favorite parts of the book is seeing so many different cultures represented in these gardens.
“People will plant vegetables or fruits that are from their own cultures, like from India or from Bangladesh or from South America,” she says. “So there’s different kinds of styles and different produce that's grown that reflects the culture of the gardeners, and we wanted to really highlight that.”
In creating this book, the club hopes to bring awareness to and advocate for this unique resource that the city of Cambridge has for its residents. They also want to continue securing funding for the gardens, because many of the gardens are on public land and need resources like water and soil. “There’s always a competition for services and dollars,” Mauzy says. “So we just wanted to make sure these [gardens] were getting their fair share of attention.”
The book will be featured in the Community of Gardens section of the Smithsonian’s archives, which hopes to bring awareness to local gardening efforts. Something special to Mauzy about the community gardening scene is the ability for people to learn from each other. She describes how grandparents bring their grandchildren to share their love of gardening, maintaining a generational tradition that will keep Cambridge’s plots alive for years to come.
Reflecting on this project, Mauzy says, “We just wanted to make sure that with all the different priorities that the city has [and that] people have in their lives, that these gardens were recognized for that treasure that they are. I mean, it sounds trite, but it really is true. And they were even more amazing than we ever imagined.”

In April 2021, Cambridge became the first city in New England to adopt a guaranteed income pilot program for low-income, single-caretaker households.
The program, called Cambridge Recurring Income for Success and Empowerment, provides $500 a month to 130 single-caretaker households for 18 months beginning in September 2021.
RISE was spearheaded by Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon and Councilor Marc C. McGovern in cooperation with community organizations like Just A Start and Cambridge Community Foundation. “The hope is that once people gain a little bit more security, they can use that financial security to then help them move forward,” McGovern says.
Khalida G. Shepard, who was recently laid off during the pandemic, is one of the participants in this program. Raising two kids as a single mother — one of whom was born during the pandemic — Shepard has found it a challenge to “keep food on the table, keep the lights on, keep [her children] happy.”
Shepard used the extra money to support both herself and her children. She was able to pay for necessities like food and gas as well as her daughter’s track and basketball extracurriculars. The added financial security gave her the breathing room to continue her education and enroll in an online mental health program.
“It was a blessing to me to have $500 coming in. It helped me to keep on going,” she says. According to the program’s organizers, other participants have reported similar positive changes in their lives.
The program organizers say that two major obstacles in implementing the program were making sure that people had access to the increased income without losing government benefits and combating the stigma against people utilizing these benefits.
Mallon says that they had to work with various state-level agencies to ensure that participants in the program would be able to receive the $500 a month benefit without losing the access to their SNAP benefits or Section 8 housing choice voucher. This way, participants would be able to use the $500 for extra breathing room, not as a replacement for existing benefits.
According to Geeta Pradhan of the Cambridge Community Foundation, another benefit of giving people cash rather than vouchers “tying down their money” is that it gives them “more agency, more control” over their lives.
“You need to trust in families, and believe in them, and know that they will make the best decisions for themselves,” Pradhan says.
“It has been an assurance of knowing that I have support and that there is somebody telling me that they have faith in me and that they believe in me,” Shepard says of the program.
However, some governments are reluctant to implement guaranteed income programs, which Pradhan attributes to stereotypes rooted in classism and racism. “It’s these misconceptions that are floating around in the world about people in poverty, people of color, immigrants,” she says. According to her, opponents of these programs assume the money is being spent irresponsibly, when it is actually used on essentials like bills, food, and housing. Being able to cover these necessities allows people access to other opportunities, like continuing education or a new job, she says.
Miriam Ortiz of JustA Start, an organization that helps families attain economic stability, adds that misconceptions surrounding these programs stem from misconceptions surrounding the nature of poverty itself. “ I think it’s just from this capitalistic, globalized society that values … pulling yourself by your bootstraps,” she says, “and sometimes thinking that poverty is some sort of moral [indicator], something that is of the individual nature.”
Shepard notes the stigma she has to confront as a low-income, single Black mother. “People feel like they know you because you’re on assistance and they talk down on you, belittle you, and treat you like you’re not human,” she says.
Siddiqui believes that the government has a duty to address poverty. “People are against types of policy antidotes to poverty and rising wealth and they think that isn't the responsibility or role of government, but I think it is,” she says.
Similar initiatives have gained traction throughout the United States. Siddiqui is involved in Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, and Cambridge RISE is one of the many pilot programs sprouting up all over the country that receive support from this coalition.
According to McGovern, RISE proves that these programs have a future, in Cambridge as well as other cities. The data describing the effects of RISE so far “build[s] the case that these programs are important,” he says.
Siddiqui sees RISE and other programs like it as a model for other cities. “That’s success in itself — that there’s more communities and more individuals that are benefiting,” she says.

What are you supposed to wear to a Seder? The question hits me just hours before I go. I didn’t even know the meaning of the word “Seder” until (at best) last year. I’m not Jewish, and I’ve never attended any Jewish ceremonies. In Hebrew, I learn, Seder means “order” — in this case, the order for conducting rituals and eating specific foods during the Passover dinner. The Hebrew words for those traditions — pesach, haggadah, karpas, maror, and charoset — I don’t learn until this week, frantically doing online research for this article.
So it’s not without some imposter syndrome that I enter Lowell House’s private dining room in my blue polka dot button-down to see an imposing, impeccably set table. This year, Harvard Hillel is sponsoring students to host their own Passover Seders, providing dinner and haggadahs (prayer books) but leaving the rest up to them. For the next two hours, despite my inexperience, I will participate in a Seder for the Lowell House community, learning what a student-run religious ceremony can look like, and what it can mean to its attendees.
At the door, Zachary J. Lech ’24 ushers me in with a warm smile, and as I take my seat he bustles back and forth, making sure everything is ready before we begin. The host of tonight’s Seder, Lech tells me he decided to organize the event because he wanted to continue the tradition from his childhood.
“I don’t feel a particular religious connection to the feast, but it’s a crucial part of my cultural heritage,” he says. Beyond celebrating the holiday with his family, he sees tremendous potential in sharing the ritual with peers at Harvard.
“As a person coming from a small town in Poland, I really lacked a vibrant Jewish community growing up,” Lech says. Hosting a Seder for Lowell was a chance to fill that absence: “to give something back,” as he puts it.
In the last two years, his appreciation for the event has only grown. As a sophomore living off-campus last spring, Lech couldn’t celebrate Passover the way he was used to, making this year’s Seder with his friends all the more special.
Back in the dining room, we begin the festivities with an invocation in Hebrew, and I look around the room. There are around 15 participants, including friends of Lech, Lowell Faculty Deans Nina Zipser and David I. Laibson ’88, a smattering of Lowellians, and a couple other freshmen.
We take turns dipping karpas (parsley, to symbolize springtime and rebirth) into saltwater (to symbolize the bitterness of tears shed during enslavement) and eating it. Everyone else seems to know what they’re doing, but I can’t tell if I’m messing something up. Are we supposed to drink the first glass of wine before or after the prayer?
I’m not used to this unfamiliarity, both of the rituals and the people around me. All the Catholic traditions I’ve celebrated — Christmas dinner, Fat Tuesday, Easter brunch — have been among family, and I suddenly realize how much meaning I’ve derived from that. Without people I know and love around me, it’s hard to appreciate the holiday. Moreover, I’ve participated in Catholic ceremonies since before I can remember; if there is a script, I know every line.
Fifteen people taking turns reading and making ritual gestures around a table — I realize Seder is not unlike a discussion seminar, and it feels like I’m the only one who hasn’t read the book.
But it does get easier. After Lech leads us through a series of chanted Hebrew blessings, we take turns reading, in English, the story of Moses and his liberation of the Israelites from bondage in Egypt. The story goes that when they fled their homes, the Israelites didn’t even have time to let their bread rise. We break matzah — unleavened bread, and the only Passover food I knew the word for beforehand — and eat it with pickled maror — horseradish.
A freshman to my right offers to pour me a cup of grape juice (a substitute for wine, which the upperclassmen hog). She, her friend, and I gulp it down, only to hear the beginning of a blessing for the beverage. We exchange glances of commiseration. It turns out I’m not the only one who hasn’t been to a Seder before.
Shriya S. Yarlagadda ’25, whose friend poured my grape juice, had been wanting to attend a Seder for a while. She and her friend will both live in Lowell House next year.
“I grew up Hindu and so I’ve been to a lot of Hindu ceremonies, but I think in coming to college I’ve wanted to branch out and explore other traditions as well,” she says.
Yarlagadda’s friend, who has attended Seders all her life, graciously begins to whisper explanations to us.
Although this ceremony, from what I can tell, largely follows tradition, it’s not without its bumps. Sometimes we flip to one page only to immediately turn back to the previous one. After some murmurs of discomfort, we replace the ritual handwashing in a communal pail with squirts of hand sanitizer. When Lech suddenly pronounces “We’ve failed,” I’m not the only slightly bewildered participant, looking to my neighbors to see if they know what went wrong.
But it’s all part of the night: As we learn a minute later, the test we failed was whether the Messiah would come in through the door, bringing the end of times. One of the better exams to fail this semester, someone quips.
I realize that maybe this is how it’s supposed to be. People’s reasons for attending range from religious obligation to social curiosity, and despite that variance, we all attempt to perform the same rituals. It’s awkward, it’s confusing, it’s intimate. And somehow, that oddly charming mix turns the strangers around me into a community.
After the other freshmen and I drain the last cup of grape juice, in unison at least with each other, it’s time to close out the ceremony. Lech starts singing “L’shana haba’ah b’Yerushalayim,” and after a couple repetitions we’re all singing, softly at first, but then Lech is dancing, raising his voice, and so we do too, the song growing rowdy, raucous, until it’s all I hear, until I know all the words, until my voice is their voice too.

After watching the esteemed rapper Swae Lee at Yardfest declare, repeatedly, that he’s at Harvard University because he’s “teaching a course on how to get lit,” I was perplexed. As a tenured professor at this esteemed university, I asked myself: “ What department does this course fall under? Why haven’t I seen Professor Lee at faculty meetings? What does getting ‘lit’ even mean?”
After extensive research and hours-long calls with my 27 grandchildren, all of whom attend Harvard, I learned that “getting lit” is synonymous with “turning up,” a term with which I am familiar. After some peer review, I realized Swae Lee was just pulling my leg and was not actually teaching a class.
If no one will teach Harvard students “how to get lit,” I, at the ripe age of 87, will. Created in conjunction with Swae Lee himself and the elusive owner of the Harvard State Instagram account, GENED 42069: How to Get Lit will approach the most important question of Generation Z from multiple lenses: legal, psychological, and field research.
GENED 42069: How to Get Lit
Head Preceptor: Swae Lee
Every Friday at 9 a.m.
Legal:
There are no laws when drinking claws. There are, however, laws when ingesting everything else. In this portion of the course, we hope to teach our students how legal systems aid, or prevent, people from partying. We will analyze the U.S. Constitution, specifically the Third Amendment, and how you can use it to prevent the ROTC kid you hooked up with from spending the night. We will analyze court precedents regarding the devil’s lettuce, indecent exposure, and graphic DFMOs at Tasty Basty and apply them to Harvard life.
Psychological:
Do you get F.O.M.O.? Hangxiety? A nagging feeling that all of your friends hate you after a night out?
We will analyze these extremely common feelings and test popular psychological theories in the process. Can we study deferred gratification with burritos on the Jefe’s line on Saturdays at 2 a.m.? Does classical conditioning work with Fireball? Do most Harvard undergrads have an Oedipus complex? The answer is yes. To all three.
Field Research and Capstone Project:
As a requirement of the class, we expect all students to go out at least once over the weekend and complete a task each time based on the previous lecture. Examples of tasks include: grinding on at least three strangers in one night, creating false identities and using fake accents to introduce yourself to strangers, and watching your best friend hook up with your crush in a dark basement. Each week in lecture, students will learn about different ways to “throw it back” and experiment with those methods over the weekend. Then, they will report back during section and receive feedback from me.
Though Harvard was named a “Top 10 Party School” by Barstool Sports, we still have a long way to go. This course will force Harvard students to put down the books and — finally — get lit.

Route 128, formally the I-95, is known among Massachusetts residents as a freeway plagued by frequent stop-and-go traffic, potholes, and ever-changing exit numbers. But Steven J. Tringale sees the highway, which spans from Gloucester to Canton, as the perfect setting for a community-based health care system.
As the president of AllWays Health Partners, the health insurance organization of Mass General Brigham, Tringale has worked with hospital administrators and clinicians to devise a new plan, called Allies, for businesses and employees in towns adjacent to and around the freeway.
Allies offers its members several perks, including $0 copays at virtual appointments and access to five specialist doctors within 72 hours of referral, at a relatively lower cost. Allies originally launched at Newton Wellesley Hospital in October of 2020 and plans to launch this June at Salem Hospital with plans on the way to add South Shore and North Shore Hospitals. Members enrolled in the Allies plan use these community-based hospitals and other care centers for all their appointments and medical needs, while those requiring more complex procedures or specialist consultations can go to Mass General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Mass Eye and Ear.
“We don’t want to make it more affordable just by cutting benefits or cutting access,” Tringale says. “We want to make it more affordable by delivering the right care at the right place, to the community sites whenever appropriate.” In doing so, Allies lowers the costs associated with most appointments and procedures, which drives down prices for customers.
Gregg S. Meyer, a primary care doctor at MGH and the vice president of Value Based Care at MGB, helped create the relationship between AllWays Health Partners and the hospital. He notes that Boston’s many research and teaching hospitals are among the nation’s best, with enormous research endowments.
“These are wonderful, wonderful hospitals,” Meyer says. “But the reality is that we actually have wonderful resources out in the community which often can meet folks’ needs.” He says that Route 128 offers a bedrock for Allies because underutilized resources along its span, like the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, can parallel the care of a well-endowed hospital for a fraction of the cost.
According to Meyer, an overreliance on the research hospitals created a bottleneck that has contributed to higher costs and inefficiency. “We have, in some of our major academic centers, incredible capacity challenges where we’re having trouble getting really sick people who need that care into the hospital,” he says. “Part of it is because there’s care that’s being delivered in those hospitals that could have actually been shifted to the community.”
Allies has had trouble entering the market due to the limits of its radius. “If you’re a small business in Newton Center with five employees and they all live in Newton or the surrounding five, six, seven, eight towns, it’s a perfect opportunity for you,” Tringale says. However, for a larger business in one of the office parks on the 128, he says, “you’re more likely to have employees who are driving all over from Eastern Massachusetts to get there. That's where we ran into that equity issue, where you couldn’t provide the same benefit to everyone if they lived outside the area.”
Tringale says that collaborating with clinicians like Meyer, hospital administrators, and insurance executives on the leadership of the initiative is a part of their plan to grow and eventually deliver care to a wider radius.
Meyer’s own practice informed the rationale behind the features Allies prioritized, like $0 virtual care copays. “I can tell you as a primary care physician, somewhere between 15 and 35 percent of the care I deliver can absolutely be delivered just as we’re interacting here right now, with the same quality,” he says, referencing our Zoom call. “It’s a whole lot more convenient than you having to drive downtown, find parking, take time off work, find childcare, waiting in the office, right?”
As a primary care physician, Meyer says he sees firsthand how frustratingly slowly the referral process moves, and so he has worked to speed up access to dermatology, cardiology, and other key specialties. “It’s a real pain point,” Meyer says. “Despite the fact that there are lots of physicians in Eastern Massachusetts, getting access to those specialties is not often as fast as it ought to be.”
Although Boston has a unique medical infrastructure that AllWays Health Partners took advantage of as it created the health plan, Tringale is optimistic that Allies is paving the way for other cities.
“I’m probably a little parochial because I’m from here,” Tringale says. Still, he promises that “a lot of what you see going on here will be adopted by a significant part of the country.”

Ah, Remy: the iconic but elusive “Harvard cat” who is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. With over 12,000 followers on Instagram, Remy has undoubtedly become one of the most popular animals on campus. But his celebrity obscures all the questionable actions that cast doubt on whether we should uplift him in the first place: is Remy really the friendly cat that he purports to be, or is he “purr” evil?
On his Instagram bio, Remy claims to be the “Unofficial Yard Guardian,” but this could merely be a euphemism for the heinous acts that he commits against our other furry friends. Look beyond his adorable eyes and charming purrs, and you will see his feral fangs and vicious claws — weapons that pose a significant danger to the birds and squirrels that are just as integral to our campus. In fact, domestic cats like Remy kill 2.4 billion birds every year and have contributed to the extinction of 63 species of wildlife! Harvard has done enough environmental damage by investing in fossil fuels; why are we contributing to the disappearance of so many innocent lives at the hands of one cat? By supporting Remy, we are disregarding the lives of other creatures that make up our campus ecosystem.
Not only is he an ecological disaster, but he’s pretentious too! With a Twitter bio that claims he is working toward his “doctorate in judicial science at a small College in Cambridge MA,” Remy the Cat is the manifestation of the worst of this elite institution: feigned humility and presumptuous pomp.
Remy is far from a native to Harvard’s campus. In fact, he belongs to a family that lives almost a mile away. As he ravages the helpless creatures of the Yard, he carries on the legacy of Harvard’s founders to pillage and plunder. Colonizer or not, Remy’s place on campus is troublesome. The coverage that is afforded to him is a luxury that less visible members of the Harvard community are not given.
What’s more, for a cat who is planning on pursuing a doctorate in judicial science, Remy spends an exorbitant amount of time in the Barker Center amongst History and Literature and English concentrators. According to his Instagram, his most recent ventures have included dorms around the Yard and the Graduate School of Design — exploring all that Harvard has to offer … except for the very classes that he should be taking. At this point, is he even working toward a degree, or is he merely exploiting our affections as a way to stay on campus?
Furthermore, I question if he even underwent the admissions process like the rest of us. What did he do to earn a place alongside members of the Harvard community? What are his qualifications? Where did he prep? What’s his SAT score? We have always assumed that Remy has always been an integral part of campus life, but as Harvard grapples with issues of access and privilege in its admissions process, this furry, four-legged friend should be right up there with athletes and legacies.
Besides his dangerous demeanor and questionable qualifications, Remy continues to perpetuate a system of unethical investments that have become all too common on campus. By monopolizing all our love and social media feeds, Remy creates an unequal distribution of social wealth, starving other pets (including his own brother Gus) of the love that they deserve. As a parent of an orange cat myself, I am constantly irked by comparisons between my cat and a “superior” Remy.
Harvard has just divested from fossil fuels, and up next are feline fools. Show your support at our protest to #StopRemy.

“Did you forget your name?”
I feel myself deflate as I hear that familiar phrase.
Nevertheless, I laugh it off, shaking my head. I hear some excuse come tumbling out of my mouth as I try to remain the epitome of poise and casual coolness.
This is why I never go to parties. Some variation of this interaction always happens and makes me remember why I wish I didn’t stutter. Sometimes it’s easy to forget, like when I’m talking to my mom or to my high school friends who have known me forever. But I am slammed back into reality by expectant stares and sarcastic comments.
I have been bracing myself for them since the moment I was diagnosed with childhood onset fluency disorder. I was five when it happened, but I can’t remember a time when I didn’t stutter. I can’t remember a time when words were easy, or when I didn’t feel embarrassed every time I opened my mouth. My life has been dominated by remaining silent, or, when it is unavoidable, scrambling to find words in my head that I won’t stutter too badly on. Ironically, though, the one phrase I have always had the most trouble with is the one that is the most unavoidable.
Chloe Elizabeth Gambol. My name. Sometimes I want to get it tattooed on myself just to feel like it’s actually mine. To look down and always remember that no matter how difficult it is to say, or how the sound of someone asking for it is a trigger for my palms to begin sweating and my heart to start racing, it belongs to me. Maybe some subconscious part of me is looking to mend our broken bond. My name has seldom felt like a blessed identification given to me by my parents, but rather a burden I was unfairly asked to carry.
It’s not just fellow students at parties that send my head spinning and make me force fake smiles and lifeless laughter. It’s dreading my 18th birthday because I knew I would have to pick up my own prescriptions and make my own doctor’s appointments, or freaking out when I discovered I would have to speak my own name at my high school graduation.
I remember the first time my mom told me to go to Giant Eagle by myself. Her betrayal felt like a knife to my heart. How could she make me humiliate myself? I remember the screaming, crying fit and hiccuping as I got in my car and drove to what felt like my very own circus: I am the clown, the star of the show. Everyone, start laughing.
My memories are littered with these moments. Passing comments, raised eyebrows, questions from people asking about my abrupt pauses that amount to the misshapen me: a girl whose words are trapped in her head. A girl who could never say what she wants to, could never be understood for who she is. Never seen for how she sees herself. My real personality is so buried beneath the weight of those words that were never said.
Most of my time since beginning college has been spent just trying to dig her out.
College social life is defined by the parties I am too anxious to go to, or the dates I am too scared to go on for fear that people will find out I stutter and decide I’m not worth the extra time and effort it takes to talk to me. It is defined by the clubs I’m too scared to join, or the leadership roles I’m too scared to take for fear that I will be seen for who I am: a fraud. A pretender. The Harvard student who can’t talk like a Harvard student.
Harvard is filled with people who know exactly what they want to do. Future politicians, confident pre-meds, mad computer scientists, ambitious world-changers. Sometimes I feel like I’m getting somewhere, that maybe I can finally be like them, but then I’m in my bedroom pulling my hair out as I struggle to say, “Hello, I’m Dr. Gambol,” and I’m back to the beginning.
I want to go out and make those ever-important connections, but the notion of having to introduce myself and then somehow appear smooth and unflawed, makes uneasy churning scramble my stomach. If I say upfront that I stutter, though, that I’m achingly vulnerable every time I open my mouth — that’ll be it. I won’t be someone defined by my accomplishments, or my interests, or my character. I will be defined by my stutter. I will be the girl who can’t say her name. At least when I laugh it off at parties I can pass it off as having too much to drink, or the music being too loud. I can hope that they will forget, and by the time I stutter substantially around them again they will have deemed me worthy enough. They will have deemed me worth the extra time, the extra effort, the extra patience.
Each first day brings me back to those moments. Each introduction, each icebreaker, each time I have to say my concentration or where I’m from. Each time I order a coffee, or the french fries from the Adams House Grill. Each time I say my name.
How do we then recognize ourselves when our name escapes us? When the syllables refuse to roll off our tongue? When nobody will give you the time to say it?
I think back to that devastating question. “Did you forget your name?”
No. I didn’t. I didn’t forget my name.
Don’t worry, though. I’ll smile and laugh and pretend I did — for both your sake and mine.

My mother dragged me to my fair share of museums as a child, so in college, I decided to even the scales by avoiding them at all costs. That is, until I was assigned to cover the Mythical Creatures Scavenger Hunt at the Harvard Museum of Natural History — an adventure that tasks visitors with identifying fossils, artifacts, and replicas that resemble famous fantasy figures.
The Mythical Creatures Scavenger Hunt runs from April 15 to May 30 throughout the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture’s four locations. Visitors participating in the self-directed experience follow a provided guide that directs them to specific artifacts. On the third floor of the Peabody Museum, for example, eagle-eyed participants can find a tapestry of a colorful bird resembling the ancient Greek phoenix. Other creatures on display include a cyclops, mermaid, genie, and centaur.
As I walked through the museum’s brick entrance, my first priority was to locate my fellow scavengers. I knew I was in the right place when I saw a pre-schooler in the lobby holding a crisp manila worksheet emblazoned with gothic font.
“I’m here for the scavenger hunt,” I told the man at the front desk. He raised his eyebrows. I figured it was either because he didn’t expect the program to draw many visitors at 11 a.m. on a Friday, or because I was an eighteen-year-old about to embark on a quest for mythical creatures.
In any case, I set off to track down my first target, a cyclops lurking on the third floor. After I made my way through the “Painting the Deep.” exhibit — a hallway of sea creature paintings with lighting reminiscent of a nightclub — I arrived at the Cenozoic mammals room. While I was unable to identify any one-eyed monsters, I did find a giant turtle shell and a stressed child in a graphic tee. “I just need to find the cyclops!” she moaned as she paced back and forth between ancient fossils.
Other participants were similarly engaged with their craft. As I ventured into a dim room filled with glass flowers, I chatted with nine-year-old Anya. “I really like learning about new animals and plants in nature,” Anya told me as she searched for an ancient, carnivorous flower that likely inspired the Super Mario franchise’s mythical Piranha Plant. Her mother added that the scavenger hunt clues had guided the duo to several wings of the museum that they had never before explored.
This is precisely why Wendy Derjue-Holzer, the education director of the Harvard Museum of Natural History, is excited about the program. She writes in an email that she hopes the adventure exposes visitors to new parts of Harvard’s museums and allows participants to “think about the origins of various myths, stories, and legends,” through a medium that is both “fun and playful.”
Arielle Ascrizzi Moon, an educator at the museum, says that the theme of the scavenger hunt fits neatly with artifacts already on display. Plus, museum-goers tend to respond positively to interactive programming. “We have done similar cross-museum hunts in the past and our visitors really enjoyed them,” Moon writes. “We have seen families and even adults using it to explore!”
From what I observed, the scavenger hunt drew particularly eager engagement among siblings. For example, as I stood in a somewhat disturbing room of taxidermied animals, I watched a child below the age of scavenger hunt comprehension trail her older brother in search of the Chupacabra, a mythical dog-like creature said to drink the blood of animals.
Unfortunately for both my enjoyment of the activity and my public image, my 12-year-old sister was not present to help me locate mythical creatures. After several failed attempts to navigate from Great Mammal Hall to the Arthropods wing, I called it quits on my scavenging career. Amid my retirement, I ran into a few of my interviewees, many of whom could not empathize with my deep confusion at the layout of the museum. Five-year-old Ari, for example, had already managed to find both the cyclops and the merfolk.
Defeated yet inspired, I made my way back to the lobby. As I exited the museum, I saw a family approaching the front desk. “Wow! A scavenger hunt!” one of the children exclaimed, as he set off with his brother to explore the mythical creatures hiding throughout the halls of the Harvard Museum of Natural History.

The Adams Seance Society goes by the acronym “ASS” — a name that “lends itself to a lot of fun,” says Vice President Charlotte R. Moses ’24. In spite of the club’s eerie subject matter, it’s often difficult to talk about ASS with a straight face. The puns are irresistible. A seance that failed to summon any spirits but cultivated a sense of community was an exercise in “building ASS up,” says Moses. Its members are called “ASScheeks.” Moses entered the society as a total skeptic and admits to “doing it for the meme.”
President Palis “Fresh” Pisuttisarun ’24, on the other hand, has always been an effusive and unrelenting spreader of the ASS gospel. They periodically stop our conversation to make their rounds of the Adams dining hall, trying to convince strangers to attend the upcoming seance. Of course, they don't think of themself as a naive believer. “You have to be discerning,” they say, legs bouncing under the table. “I think the thing about ASS that’s so interesting is that we’re always balancing that fine line between skepticism and an openness to the unknown.”
“Everything is silly, and that’s great,” says Moses, the calm counterpart to Pisuttisarun’s boundless energy. “But who thought we would ever actually have another seance? To be honest, I never thought we’d ever make contact with anyone. And I kind of think we might have heard a tap.”
By a tap, Moses means a disembodied, otherworldly tap — the tap of a Harvard spirit communicating through a ghostly portal and reaching the halls of Adams House. One tap for “yes,” two taps for “no.” At their first seance, the members didn’t hear taps for every question they asked, and sometimes the taps were easily attributable to the usual creaks and shudders of an old wooden building. But several of the taps were “loud and clear,” Pisuttisarun says.
As the acronym might betray, ASS began as a lighthearted joke between friends. The founding members, including Moses and Pisuttisarun, met last semester on the fifth floor of Fairfax Hall, where they each live with a different blocking group. As they grew closer, they developed a tradition of Sunday “circle time,” Pisuttisarun says.
“We would just sit around in a circle and talk, play games, stuff like that,” they say. “And then one day, I said, ‘Wow, the way we’re sitting in a circle, it feels just like we’re having a seance!’”
Of course, no one thought anything of it — there was no way that Pisuttisarun would seriously want to hold a seance, Moses says, recalling her thinking at the time. But a month-and-a-half later, her phone lit up with a surprise summons to a Tuesday seance. Pisuttisarun wasn’t joking after all.
They’d done some research into the mechanics of summoning spirits, because “it’s not everyday knowledge,” they say. In addition to finding spells and chants, they also looked into the stories of people who have died at Harvard — according to Pisuttisarin, spirits remain stuck wherever they die.
“We take safety very seriously at ASS,” Pisuttisarun explains. “We definitely don’t want to upset people, and we don’t want to summon any evil spirits, since that’s dangerous, of course. It can possess you and it can lead to anything ranging from paranoia to shock to death.”
With that cheerful disclaimer aside, the club has recently opened its spiritual gatherings to the entire Harvard community — or, as Pisuttisarun puts it, “getting ASS off the ground.”
At their inaugural open seance, Pisuttisarun pushes the door open, allowing its creak to ring out to the attentive audience, revealing the Adams House music room. The only light in the room flows from two windows, each marked at the top with a shield of patchwork stained glass. On the far wall stands a piano, half-covering the red brick which seals an imposing fireplace with the Veritas crest carved into its mantle.
The group crams into the space and sits down in a circle, cross-legged on the cracked marble floors. Facial features merge with darkness, but voices cut through clear as day as one by one, they introduce themselves. They each answer an ice breaker — What were you in a past life? — with answers ranging from “a tree” to “a Victorian boy.” Food offerings, most of them stolen from Adams Brain Break, are arranged in the center, encircled by battery-operated flickering candles.
At Pisuttisarun’s cue, neighbors join hands as they detail the Seance Society’s practices. When they begin speaking of malevolent spirits, their demeanor changes. In a solemn voice, they warn that if anyone feels a malevolent presence, they should break the circle of hands to dissipate it.[
One member of the circle, after tossing in a bag of jelly beans, begins the chant:: “To all the ones that came before, knock upon the spiritual door.” Everyone closes their eyes, and the group repeats the incantation three times in unison. A heavy silence follows as each member prepares questions for the spirits.
A voice pierces the silence, inquiring if there are spirits there with them. They wait with eager ears. Suddenly, it comes — a tap on the walls — faint and indistinct, but enough to send the room into an uproar.
Someone asks if the spirit is non-binary. Two taps respond. The spirit is definitely not non-binary. Another person chimes in to inquire if the spirit had attended the first Thanksgiving. Two taps again.
After a small period of silence, someone asks if the spirit had ever been in love. From somewhere within the walls, the sound of two taps rings through the room.

The year is 2013, and roommates David F. Sackstein ’14 and Jose A. Bengochea ’13 are facing the prospect of a broken doorknob in their Adams House double.
In the spirit of Adams House quirk, rather than calling anyone, they decide to tinker around with it themselves.
They toss the knob to the side. Take out the screws. Remove the bronze panel.
They peer inside the dark cavity. An idea arises.
Sackstein takes a piece of paper off his notepad, writes a few sentences, then folds it up and scrawls a title on the front: “A Gift from the Past.” The two of them take a pair of pliers and slip it into the crevice. Place the panel back on. Tighten the screws. Reinstall the knob. Their very own message in a bottle has just set sail.
Right after, Sackstein made a Facebook post, playfully telling his friends about the note he had left to future residents. They didn’t expect anyone to ever read it. Why would anyone bother to look inside of a doorknob?


Nine years later, Alexa C. Jordan ’22 and Sophie M. Woodward ’22 finally decide to do something about their pesky doorknob.
On the morning of the first day of spring classes, Carlos Miranda, a custodian in Adams House, is in the room dismantling the device when Jordan, standing by the fireplace in her common room, spots scraps of paper littering the rug on her bedroom floor.
She immediately walks over to investigate. Reaching inside, she pulls out a small folded piece of paper.
“A Gift from the Past” is written on it.
She unfurls the letter.The paper is littered with dirt and holes, disrupting the text, but she is able to decipher most of it. It reads:
“Dear friend,
In January of 2013, David Sackstein, one of the inhabitants of a Harvard College dorm room, B21, attempted to repair a broken door mechanism in his room. By this assumption, this mechanism was [indecipherable] close to 100 years old at the time. Due to upcoming development, he does not expect his door to remain much longer. However, he is still [indecipherable] to contacting [indecipherable]. Sorry for the [indecipherable].
Love,
David Sackstein”


Jordan and Woodward couldn’t believe what they had found.
“It was a gold mine, you know? This is something that doesn’t happen. It was a gift from the past,” Jordan says. “It was like the ecstasy you feel on a Christmas morning when you find something so surprising, so fun.”
The next weeks of her and Woodward’s life were dominated by searching for the writers.
With only Sackstein’s full name and graduation year, Jordan tracked him down on LinkedIn, where she reached out to his company email.
“Once again, it felt like a jackpot, and I felt like a sleuth,” she says. “It also reminds me that we are able to connect with alumni much easier than we might think, and it’s up to us to utilize those connections and really a fantastic network that we are so blessed to now be able to benefit from.”
Sackstein responded immediately to Jordan’s cold email. “We never expected in a million years anyone to find it, but when Alexa reached out and Sophie reached out, it was a real treat,” he says.
Westmorly Court, the Adams dorm where Jordan and Woodward live, is the next Harvard dorm building in line for renovation, so they discovered the note in the nick of time.
“We’re both kind of sentimental people,” Sackstein says. He adds: “We weren’t sure what little Easter eggs and marks and time capsules we might be able to leave behind, thinking that house renovation was on the horizon.”
Adams House’s legacy of historical and artistic traditions inspired Sackstein and Woodward to create their note. For example, beneath the dining hall run tunnels painted with art and poetry and filled with introspective musings and hopeful messages from generations of Harvard students past.
“We just thought, ‘Oh, this is our little way to add to the history of everybody who’s had a chance to have a relationship with this institution and has been shaped by it but has also shaped it in their own way,’” Sackstein says.
In the grand scheme of things, the nine-year lifespan of Sackstein’s letter does not seem so long. Yet, it’s half a lifetime for many Harvard undergraduates. “It felt like it was bridging two generations,” Jordan says. She adds: “I was 13 years old when this letter was being written, and I’m now at Harvard. I had no idea I would be at Harvard nine years ago, right? That wasn't on my radar.”
Nine years after writing the note, Bengochea now lives in California and works for his own company, while Sackstein is currently a tutor in DeWolfe but plans to step away next year to further his law career. The email they received from Jordan, however, was a pleasant reminder of their time as undergraduates. Sackstein was touched to know that “there’s two people living in that suite again, and that they’re enjoying their time there.” He adds: “I think that’s one of the more touching parts of what’s happened, for me at least, to know that this is something that maybe helped make two undergrads who are just returning to campus feel a little bit more at home and a little bit more a part of things.”
The discovery of the note also sparked a friendship between Jordan and Miranda, the custodian. When they see each other in the hallways of Westmorly Court, they stop to chat like old friends who share a secret.
For Jordan and Woodward, finding the letter has sparked a conversation about what it means to exist here at Harvard — an institution that often seems too old for current students to comprehend.
“I think we all want to leave something behind at Harvard. It’s just such a big place and such a big institution in which sometimes it feels hard to make our mark,” Jordan says. She adds: “I will never forget when I found a hidden note inside of my dorm.”

I can take on a cockroach. If I saw one crawling around my room, I would be disturbed, but capable of disposing of it. Ethically, of course.
But the few times that I’ve encountered a Cambridge rat — which, I swear, are more robust and vicious-looking than any rodent you’ve ever encountered before — have sent me shrieking, spiraling, and begging for mercy on the cold, red-brick sidewalk.
So that’s why I was immensely relieved when the city of Cambridge announced that it plans to install $50,000 worth of high-tech rat traps around town. These “Smart Boxes” will electrocute their victims after luring them inside, and some will even be placed in “Smart Pipes” that flush the grisly remains away.
I dream of a college experience where I can walk the streets of Mass. Ave without the fear of encountering one of these monstrous creatures careening toward me during a late-night CVS run. Even so, I know better than to underestimate what the rats around here are capable of, and I worry that our little friends here might be clever enough to evade the devices poised to eliminate them.
Much like the students they scamper amongst, Harvard rats are a diverse and exceptional crop. Take the Kirkland rats for example, who live in a building that stands almost exactly as it was built in 1931. The few times I’ve walked through Kirkland’s crumbling (charming?) halls, I’ve heard the rodents scurrying across the ceilings and walls around me — an unmistakable heavy pitter-patter. After living in this painfully “historic” building, those rats have become scrappy. Like all Kirkland residents, they have learned to settle for less, and with such resourcefulness and grit, it would take more than a Smart Box to capture them.
And don’t even get me started on the Adams rats — they’ve probably built empires down in the tunnels. Having recently won The Battle for the D-Hall over encroaching an fruit fly offensive, Adams rats have undoubtedly developed an advanced, tactical military force, unlikely to be stopped by a Smart Box.
Here at The Crimson, too, I fear we may have trained our rats to be too smart for our own good. Lounging safely within the archaic walls of 14 Plympton St., these rats have certainly learned a thing or two from the writers, reporters, and editors whose leftover Jefe’s they enjoy in the wee hours of the morning. I worry that they’ll hear news of the latest method to outsmart a Smart Box before it even comes to print. At least they’d definitely fare better than the Lampoon rats, though. Poor fellas over there haven’t slept a lick since construction started over a century ago.
Across the river is an elusive bunch. The athlete rats are tough — maybe even strong enough to withstand the electric shock promised by the inventive Smart Box technology. But capturing a rat on a scooter? Impossible. Our rodent friends at the Business School are quite clever as well. Maybe the traps were just part of their scheme to get Cambridge to spend more money on an unfeasible venture.
So as the rat trap installation comes under way in June 2022, you’ll see me walking through campus with a new stride in my step — as long as we remain one step ahead of these pestilent critters at all times. Maybe then we’ll reach the vermin-free Harvard experience we all dream of.

The first time I met Muriel Morisey ’69, Jeff P. Howard ’69, and Wesley E. Profit ’69 was under the fluorescent lighting of the Harvard University Archives, while hunched over a hefty, leather-bound yearbook from 1969 flipped open to page 88. It was the 333rd edition printed in the history of Harvard-Radcliffe, but the only one with a 24-page section titled “BLACKS.”
At the time, the yearbook’s managing editor was Lee S. Smith ’69, who’d enlisted the help of his fellow Black seniors to capture the unique experiences of their class. When they started college in 1965 at the height of the Civil Rights Era and heightened integration efforts, they were the largest population of Black students ever admitted to Harvard at the time — a grand total of 40 men and seven women. Their subsequent four years on campus were defined by constant unrest as they grappled with the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. during their junior spring, a rising Black Power movement, and several Vietnam War protests, including an infamous University Hall takeover.
The result of Smith’s effort was eight editorial essays written by Black students with various backgrounds and experiences, but all asserting their right to tell their own stories in their own way. Each of them were vibrant, with powerful voices that leapt off the page. As I read about these students who’d navigated Harvard’s campus 53 years before me, they put words to the internal struggles that I’d brushed off as my own over-exaggerations: misogyny within the Black community, the ever-present shade drawn over Harvard’s inner workings and how to navigate them, or the seemingly unbreakable fortitude of an unchanging institution.
The essays in that yearbook were proof that what I was feeling was real — providing the kind of comfort that can only be found in the affirming voice of an elder.
I was able to get in contact with three of the original authors. But to my (admittedly naive) surprise, the 20-something-year-olds I’d met on the worn pages of that yearbook were drastically different from the 70-something-year-olds I had the opportunity to speak to. After 53 years of life outside of Harvard’s gates, they were more detached.
They approached the relatable struggles that seemed to consume them in their personal essays with light chuckles, soft nods, and knowing smiles. I couldn’t help but feel a bit alienated. The three students I met in the yearbook wouldn’t have brushed off our shared burdens as distant affairs of the past. It was as real to them then as it is to me now. But I was beginning to realize that those versions of them were long gone.
Because Morisey’s essay was the only one written by a woman at Radcliffe (a “Cliffie,” as she affectionately refers to herself), I gravitated toward it immediately. In it, she discusses how maddening it is to be both Black and a woman — often feeling forced to sacrifice one or the other for her survival.
“Radcliffe does not yet understand her black students, and Harvard does not yet know what to do with its women, and as a result the black Cliffie does not yet know what to do with herself,” Morisey wrote back in 1969.
When I had the opportunity, I was eager for her to elaborate on what it was like to be a Black Cliffie during such a contentious time. “Because we were Harvard students, we were absolutely convinced we were in a position to change the world,” she says. I nod in awe.
“Fifty-three years later, that strikes me as ludicrous. No offense to you,” she says.
We laugh together, and I assure her no offense was taken — but it definitely deflates my ego a bit. I came onto this campus with the exact mindset she described, an increased sense of self-importance and a one-track mind that is a trademark of Harvard change-makers. I wouldn’t say I’ve become more pessimistic. I still believe that the ability to radically reimagine the world around me is essential to who I am, but I have come to realize that there are many different routes to changing the world, in both big and small ways. I’m still figuring out where I fit into that.
Beyond world-changing or the lack thereof, Morisey looks back on her experience at Radcliffe with bittersweet pride. Even as she reminisces on the difficulty of being a Black Cliffie, I sense that she sees a bigger picture, one beyond each negative moment she experienced as an undergraduate. This doesn’t necessarily mean ignoring pain and strife or dismissing her 1969 self’s experiences, but Morisey refuses to let these moments define her.
While keenly aware of the historical and institutional oppression of Black people, and especially having experienced it firsthand at Radcliffe, Morisey still finds herself exasperated by the narrative of victimhood. “I need the protection of the Civil Rights laws, I need the protection of a constitution that’s honored, but I don'’t need to be protected from the presence of white people,” she says.
My mother has told me something similar many times, which I’ve always dismissed as wrongfully placing too much of the blame on the mindset of Black people. But thinking about what Morisey (and my mother, for that matter) has been through, I begin to understand where they’re coming from. To be called a victim can feel like an insult to the resilience they’ve displayed by making it this far. If I made it out of “hell,” as Morisey once described her Radcliffe experience, I’d also get pretty annoyed if other people said I still needed protection. Even if some people sort of do.
In 1969, Morisey wrote, “Hopefully this situation is a temporary one. Today, however, it is at best a greater psychological challenge than one usually bargains for and at worst a kind of particularly feminine hell.”
But after our interview, it appears that hell doesn’t seem so hot from where she stands now, 53 years later. It makes me wonder just how much of my own personal hells are created for me — and how much of the flames are courtesy of my own ignition.
I ask her what she’d say to her 1969 self. “You’re going to be okay. None of the painful things stopped you. None of the bad moments set you back,” she says. “No one can take it away. The world can never undo what you’re achieving.”
It is beautiful, and it probably shouldn’t be as mind-blowing as it is.
So perhaps I don’t need to wait another 53 years for my hell to freeze over. Maybe it’s all relative to where I choose to stand.
Howard’s essay was a survey of his class’s intense organizing efforts to create an Afro-American Studies departmentn. As he described their experience, Howard boldly refused to accept civility and the rational nature of the “Harvard man” as a justification for inaction. He wrote with passion and fervor in the defense of Black rage. On the page, Howard sounded much like other Black radicals of the time period.
But he answered the Zoom call poised in front of a pristine background with the reflection of a ring light glinting on his glasses — all business, and clearly not his first rodeo. He didn’t look like the fierce 20-year-old I met on paper.
As president of the Association of African and Afro-American Students (more commonly known as Afro) during his junior year, Howard says he was “kind of in the center of everything.”
His involvement in political activism on campus felt natural. “It wasn’t like a choice was made,” he says. In 1969, Howard wrote, “At Harvard, black student anger was well-directed from the beginning.”
Now, Howard thinks differently.
“I think I was harder on [Harvard administration] than I would be from my perspective at age 73. They were doing what they were supposed to do. They were operating the way they had always operated,” he says. “It blunted the immature, somewhat irrational emotionalism of 20-year-olds.”
It sounded like hell didn’t seem nearly as hot from where Howard was standing, either. The fire which flowed through his pen at 20 years old had cooled significantly.
Will I look back on my own radical ideas and chuckle someday? Is hell really that hot, or am I blinded by the burning flames of youth?
For the most part, I think hell really is that hot. This institution is built on oppressive forces that are resistant to changing their ways — which I don’t believe can be so easily justified by chalking up every student’s concern to irrationalism. But Howard is probably right in some ways. I am an emotional 19-year-old, with views that are constantly developing as I experience more of the world. The problem is figuring out in which moments I should be more like Morisey and trust that things will be okay in the end, and in which moments I should demand immediate action.
Profit’s essay explored the shifting attitudes toward leaving one’s Blackness at the door while integrating into white student organizations, and how his class eventually found ways to let it inform and enhance their work.
Profit recalls that before officially moving into Harvard, he’d decided to stay in Cambridge a couple weeks early to get a lay of the land. One day, he found himself in the North End of Boston exploring a historical site in a cemetery.
“I look up, and there are a bunch of white kids from the North End that are calling me everything but a child of God, and threatening me, so I hurry up, got out of the cemetery, and left,” Profit says.
While I am initially startled by the racial violence of this anecdote, Profit seems unfazed and chuckles heartily — he places more value on the fact that the racist incident gave him something to contribute to the dinner table of fellow Black classmates at the Freshmen Union, which then served as a freshman dining hall. It makes me wonder if his 1969 self would’ve regarded the incident with the same lightheartedness.
Profit recalls a fond memory of one of his friends at this Freshman Union table.
“He sat down at the table, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a bottle of Tabasco sauce,” Profit says. “And everybody thought he was great because in the condiments that were available when you came through the line to get your meal, there was no Tabasco sauce. There’s no hot sauce whatsoever. And here, [he] had brought it in.”
He regards this as a tiny example of adjusting to Harvard, and he notes, “You know, eventually, Harvard did the same. By the time of my sophomore year, there was Tabasco sauce among the other condiments that you found in the house.”
Profit embodies the idea of joy serving as an act of resistance, choosing to find humor in the microaggressions he routinely experienced at Harvard rather than dwelling on the hurt. He appreciates the small changes in the world, like adding Tabasco to the dining halls.
He taught me that hell didn’t have to feel so hot if you could laugh your way through it.
By the end of this experience, I can’t help but think back to those 20-year-olds I met in the University Archives, to the heat of their experiences that resonated with me so deeply. I’m not sure if the wisdom gained by time and perspective is truly powerful enough to cool the hells they vividly described 53 years ago.
Is it possible that the forces causing me to doubt my own struggles enough to seek out the guidance of dusty old yearbook pages are the same ones that make the bad memories and strong emotions seem so dull for the class of 1969? Personally, I’m no stranger to downplaying past experiences — it’s a defense mechanism that desensitizes me from painful reflection.
Regardless of how they perceive it now, Howard was an emotional 20-year-old that also happened to be right, Profit still proudly shares his tiny Tabasco story of change, and everything was okay in the end for Morisey — even if she didn’t change the world in college.
For now, I think that’s enough for me. But give me another 53 years, and that answer might change.

They say that history repeats itself, that all great empires must one day fall. And that in their wake, new empires will rise.
The year was 1991, and the Soviet Union had just dissolved. Large state assets and parts of the Russian economy were up for grabs, and they quickly became privatized by Russian oligarchs lucky enough to have political connections. Factories, offices, you name it — those wise enough to see the opportunity were able to buy up state infrastructure for their own good.
Dear reader, I am here to ensure that this part of history does in fact repeat itself. No, no, I’m not preying on anyone’s downfall. It’s already happened! After 40 years, the Harvard Undergraduate Council has fallen. And I will certainly take advantage of this momentous opportunity to acquire some of the UC’s most coveted assets.
First up: the acquisition of the @HarvardUC Twitter account. At almost 2k followers, it’s looking pretty sexy, and I’d like to streamline my access to the proletariat.
Unfortunately, the UC Twitter account did not respond to my request for the current bidding price. However, due to my spectacular investigative skills, I found that I am not the only Harvard student on a hungry power grab (shocker!!). Some budding entrepreneur named Hurrsun has already tried to acquire the means of production (of the Tweets). Hurrsun's messages with the UC suggest that the price may be higher than one Student Activities Fee. They haven’t named the exact price point, but they’ve scoffed at the idea of a mere $100.
I’m a college student on a budget. And $100? That’s already pushing it. It looks like buying the *actual* UC Twitter account might not be within my budget. Of course, I could probably make a GoFundMe and everyone who contributes could own a share of the account — but that seems complicated, and I have psets to go work on.
The next best option? Posing as the UC Twitter account. After changing my profile picture, name, bio, and cover photo to be the exact same as the UC’s, no one will know the difference.
Next up: the infamous UC Patagonias. Those things look really cozy. I want them. But, friends, I have no interest in having “Harvard Undergraduate Council” emblazoned across my chest. Let’s think: what letters can we remove from the Patagonias to create a better message?
HARVARD
UNDERGRADUATE
COUNCIL
How about HARVARD NERD COUNCIL? That sounds about right. Might as well embrace it. I will make sure to distribute the Nerd Council Patagonias as soon as I acquire them. First-come-first-serve basis, besties, and I expect them to go faster than a lacrosse player scootering across the second floor of Cabot Library.
What about the old UC office space? Located in the Smith Campus Center, this is prime real estate, so it’s fit for one thing and one thing only — another Clover cafe. God, those are so hard to come across these days. And you know I’m absolutely craving that parsnip lemonade. It takes forever for me to walk to the other Clover in the Square already. Or the one in the Science Center. Or the other, smaller one also in the Science Center.
Man, if only I had won the UC’s lottery to get a discounted BlueBikes subscription. As revenge, I will be taking all of the BlueBike subsidies to enable my HARVARD NERD COUNCIL coalition to get across Cambridge effectively. Why would you take the Quad shuttle when you could work out your actual quads with a nice bike ride? This is a health campaign, too, people. Let’s get Harvard ripped.
And with that, go. Go take on the power you know you want. I hope that this inspires you to acquire your own assets that have been left behind by empires past.

Before embarking on my spring break trip to Istanbul with the Harvard College in Asia Program, I had been warned: You can’t fully trust the weather forecast, and the city runs on its own time. Still, in retrospect, I did not know what I was getting into.
It’s March 12, ten hours after a packed red-eye flight. Wearing wet rain boots soaked in the cold snow, three other Harvard students and I carried our suitcases up the hilly, snowy streets of Bebek. A spring break escape from the Boston snow turned into a deeper dive into even more snow in Istanbul.
After safely storing our belongings at the Boğaziçi security office, we made our way down the street to Harvard Cafe, a small restaurant filled with Harvard-themed decorations and photos. Hungry, tired, and sore from the grueling uphill strength training session, we devoured the entirety of our manti, a dish of Turkish ravioli covered in butter oil and yogurt. The Boğaziçi University students welcomed us with radiant smiles on their faces, and the cafe staff even gave us discounts for being HUID holders. Little did I know that this was only the beginning of an 11-day sleepless adventure in this historic city.
Istanbul and its rich histories are truly unique. Sprawling across the European and Asian sides of the Bosphorus Strait, this lively metropolis is home to more than 15.6 million people. From the Topkapi Palace’s mystifying harem and the Dolmabahçe Palace’s impressive Ceremonial Hall, to the glittering chandeliers in the Hagia Sophia and the bustling labyrinth of Grand Bazaar, this city breathes history. During our afternoon strolls down the old city center in Sultanahmet, we were taken back through thousands of years of culture and civilization. In every corner of the street, the mosques, kebab kiosks, and palaces that we visited carry bits of memories from the Byzantines, the Ottomans, and the current Republic of Turkey.
Though imbued with history, Istanbul and its people seem to have forgotten about time in other ways. Whenever we entered any mosques, museums, or historical landmarks, the Boğaziçi students would patiently and thoroughly share detailed stories about the history behind these buildings. It’s been six years since the last in-person HCAP Istanbul conference – punctuated by three years of holding remote Harvard conferences – making this a much-needed trip with a little more time spent here and there, a few more questions asked, and several spontaneous detours.
By the fourth day, two or three more cups of boiling hot çay (Turkish tea), extra Turkish 101 lessons taught by our friendly hoca (teacher), and three-hour long conversations were a part of our normal routines. In the next two days, we traversed the Asian side of the city, tried bountiful serpme (traditional breakfast with over six different types of cheese), sampled eight different types of Turkish delights at the Grand Bazaar, watched our new friend Ekin tell fortunes with coffee grinds, and climbed the Galata Tower for nighttime sightseeing. It was 10 p.m. when we finished dinner, but our night continued at Meyhane — a Turkish night club, with more tapa-style food, Raki (the national drink made of distilled grapes and anise), and high-energy belly dancers.
At Harvard, I used to have everything scheduled to the minute. Yet, in Turkey, time became more of a guideline than a steadfast rule. If we didn’t get through our itinerary, no one freaked out; there was always tomorrow. Because of this freedom from stringent, self-imposed schedules, I spent the majority of my time capturing all the moments from this trip. My iPhone, not surprisingly, ran out of storage after I took over 5000 photos and videos of the neighborhoods we visited, friends I made and got closer to along the way, and over 30 different Turkish dishes we ate.
Even though it has been more than a month since we returned, I still think about the day we first arrived in Istanbul and walked up those hilly paths to reach the Boğaziçi dining hall. I still drink çay every morning before going to class; it has become one of my habits now. I still fondly share every detail about the trip with all my close friends at Harvard when we reunite over a meal.
And every time I flip through my 5000 videos and photos, I imagine strolling down the street side by side with our Turkish friends, reliving my days in Istanbul, a city that time forgot.

Ditch the yogurt. Toss out your sauerkraut. Chuck your kefir, your kombucha, your kimchi. There’s a new probiotic in town — Ara P. Katz and Raja Dhir, co-founders of Seed Health, claim that taking just two of their forest green capsules daily on an empty stomach will support digestive function and make you feel strengthened gut barrier, healthy skin, and of course, more regular shits, all for a $50 monthly delivery subscription.
The world of probiotics is a Wild West, dominated by nutritional companies that often make unregulated, hyperbolic claims. Seed Health, however, purports to be driven not by sensational promises but by scientific testing and clinical trials.
The company, informed by an advisory board that boasts many Harvard Medical School affiliates, including Maurizio Fava and George M. Church, employs a hybrid structure at the intersection of academia and biotech. Early developmental research is published in peer-reviewed publications, while translational work is conducted through randomized clinical trials. This unique approach has garnered attention from investors — in April 2021, Seed Health procured $40 million.
“Our philosophy and model has always been to seek out the best science in this space and to collaborate from the point of discovery with the scientists,” Dhir says.
Harvard Human Evolutionary Biology professor Rachel Carmody, who conducts research in nutritional microbiology and is unaffiliated with Seed Health, finds reassurance in the company’s commitment to science. “I approach probiotic companies with a skeptical eye,” she says. “The way that they describe the microbiome [on their website] is, coming from a scientist’s perspective, more responsible than what I’ve seen from other companies. It gives me faith that they will communicate what they do and do not know.”
Katz echoes concerns about probiotic companies making false claims — she realized this trend during her pregnancy and breastfeeding experience, which served as a catalyst for starting the company.
“Between the algorithms of the internet and all the unsolicited advice, I was very fascinated by how ungrounded so much of the products and information that I was receiving [were], even, in some cases, from practitioners,” Katz says.
The start-up has been working tirelessly ever since, in what Dhir calls “total immersion,” to create the technology to put its probiotic supplement DS-01 Daily Synbiotic, short-handed “DS-01,” on the market.
Unlike traditional probiotics, DS-01 contains two nested capsules. The nucleus holds 24 bacterial strains that the team believes mirror the function of most bacteria in a human gut microbiome, while the outer shell is filled with a prebiotic formula designed to boost the bacteria’s activity once it enters the gut. This precise construction is supposed to deliver the bacterial cocktail to the right spot in the gastrointestinal tract.
The company also recently launched the PDS-08 Pediatric Daily Synbiotic, or just “PDS-08”, a powder parents can stir into their kid’s’ food that contains nine strains of bacteria and five grams of fiber.
Carmody emphasizes the importance of consumer transparency, remarking that “You want to make sure that the company actually is giving you the actual strain that they say they are giving you on the label,” she says. “Historically, in the probiotic sphere, that has not been the case.”
Pieter A. Cohen, a general internist who directs the Supplement Research Program at the Cambridge Health Alliance, says he’s not easily convinced by any supplement company’s claims about what’s inside their capsules.
“​​You’re completely at the mercy of the manufacturer,” he says. “The FDA does no testing of these products; the stores do no testing of these products.” Through his research, he’s found serial incidences of companies falsifying information on labels, causing harm to consumers.
To be labeled true “probiotics,” rather than nutritional supplements, products must demonstrate health benefits. Seed Health was granted FDA acceptance to move forward with clinical testing in patients — demonstrating promising signs of its products’ efficacy.
Currently, it’s running a Phase 2 clinical trial at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to see if patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome feel any symptom improvement from taking the DS-01 supplement. Another study explores whether DS-01 could restore healthy microbiota after disruption by antibiotics. The results from both of these trials are expected to be released later this year, according to Dhir. Aside from DS-01, Seed Health has also completed a promising trial of PDS-08 in constipated children.
For Dhir, the end goal of these studies is to gain FDA approval, which would elevate the product’s status to a drug with proven clinical benefits.
When DS-01 launched, Seed Health was not initially planning on conducting clinical trials, but they started to explore the possibility of testing efficacy upon receiving positive feedback from their consumers with IBS who had seen improvement in their symptoms.
“Normally we would never have spontaneously thought to put a consumer probiotic consortia into an RCT [Randomized Control Trial] for IBS. That’s just not typical,” Dhir says. He explains that it was “partially motivated by knowing the mechanism of action, but partially motivated by some strong feedback that we got voluntarily from people who had tried many, many different interventions with that condition, and this was the one that was efficacious.”
While Seed Health markets DS-01 for all “humans ages 18+” regardless of health status, its FDA status as an investigational new drug is to evaluate its impact on patients with IBS. Though it is also being studied in other clinical trials, this raises concerns for Cohen, who says trials for such an early stage and small sample size demonstrate little about the product’s true nature.
“In the normal drug development stage, [a Phase 1 trial] that would just be like a very, very, very preliminary thing before it was seeing the light of day,” Cohen says.
Still, Cohen notes that studying the impact of the supplement is important to expanding the field.
“I really applaud any high-quality studies of probiotics, because there’s definitely big potential for health benefits,” he adds.
According to Gyorgy Baffy, chief of gastroenterology at the VA Boston Healthcare System and associate professor at HMS, dietary supplements are often band-aid solutions to symptoms that would see greater resolution with changes in diet, exercise, and other lifestyle habits. In his experience treating GI issues like IBS, Baffy has observed that patients are drawn to medication and supplements.
“They say, ‘Pill, pill, pill, because then I don’t have to change anything. Then I just sit back and relax, and give me that pill and it will take care of everything for me,’” he parodies. “Rather than thinking through what you don’t do well in your life.”
He approaches supplements with low expectations when patients inquire about them. “I usually tell my patients, when they come up with probiotic therapy, that this might not work. It's worth a shot; it probably won’t hurt,” Baffy says.
Recognizing the importance of people getting more involved in their personal health, two years ago, Seed Health launched a digital campaign called #giveashit where people sent pictures of their poop as a citizen science initiative to advance research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the gut microbiome.
While Seed Health adopts a more “biotech” structure, as Dhir calls it, in the research and development process, this campaign is evidence of a marketing strategy that encourages an intimate connection between humans and science.
“One of the things we always wanted to do is really shapeshift how science can show up in the world in a way that can feel really humanistic, spiritual, beautiful, accessible, and digestible — no pun intended,” Katz says.
Seed Health also used its social media presence to bolster recruitment for its clinical trials.
“In combination with the native and existing network, as well as us using digital marketing techniques to actually access and recruit patients directly that are geo-located within the Boston area, we were able to leverage one of our company’s core capabilities to increase clinical trial recruitment,” Dhir says.
The results of the trial will need to show major improvement to prove that the placebo effect is not responsible for improvements in IBS symptoms. Background influences like their doctor’s bedside manners or messaging in advertising might prime patients for a certain clinical response to the treatment.
“You really have to shoot something big to surpass that 40, 50 percent placebo effect that we see, which happens just because you care, because you listen to the patient, because the patient is selected for something that potentially might help,” Baffy says. “That is actually paralyzing many randomized control trials in the field.”
In its description of the trial, Seed Health and its collaborators at Beth Israel acknowledge that the potency of the placebo effect ranges from 16 to 71 percent in the IBS population.
Instead of addressing these concerns about clinical trials, some probiotic companies forgo the process altogether, exploiting their status as an unregulated nutritional supplement to avoid proving their claims. Though they cannot be labeled as “probiotics,” current U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations allow nutritional supplements to be sold over the counter and online without undergoing testing. In fact, they’re classified as a “food” by the FDA, says Aaron S. Kesselheim, a professor at HMS and former member of the FDA advisory committee.
“You can go to Whole Foods or CVS or whatever, and you’ll see rows and rows of nutritional supplements and products that are sold without clinical testing,” Kesselheim says. “As long as they’re not making trumped up or puffed up claims about what the product can do without having demonstrated that in any kind of rigorous way, then it’s allowed.”
Recent advances in the potency of nutritional supplements may be a call to action for the FDA to rethink how it regulates probiotics and other supplements, as well as help patients and physicians wade through the muddle of claims to find products that really work.
Regardless of how far Seed Health gets in its mission to reimagine human health and environmental systems through probiotics, Baffy is certain that biotech and supplement companies like it have set the course in motion for a field that’s only getting started. Baffy, who finished his medical training in Hungary in 1980, remembers a time before the concept of microbiota entered into clinical and scientific jargon. Now, he says, knowledge of the field is spreading.
The future looks good for prokaryotes: as it’s growing and developing DS-01 and PDS-08, Seed Health is initiating Phase 1 trials this year for a new probiotic for vaginal health that prevents sexually transmitted infections. If it is successful, Dhir claims it will be “one of the greatest breakthroughs in women’s health and reproductive biology.”
Beyond DS-01 and investigating the vaginal microbiome, Seed Health is also invested in saving bee colonies and exploring how the gut microbiome recovers after alcohol consumption, which Katz postulates is “top of mind for college students.” From its clinical trials to its consumer connections, Seed Health bills itself as a company committed to science, and its niche is only expanding.
“I find it difficult to believe how for so long, we ignored the microbiota, and it’s refreshing to see that over the past 15, 20 years, [we] made this recognition that, ‘Hey, these little bodies are there for a reason, and we really should pay more attention to them than what we have been,’” Baffy says. “I think it’s very exhilarating.”
Corrections: June 11, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the company Seed Health claims its DS-01 product will lead to improved digestive support. In fact, the company claims only that its product will support digestive function, not lead to an improved or changed state. 
A previous version of this article misstated the names of Seed Health’s PDS-08 Pediatric Daily Synbiotic product and its DS-01 Daily Synbiotic product.
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that clinical testing of Seed Health’s DS-01 product has centered around observing its effect in IBS patients.

I did not come to Harvard for the party scene.
I am reminded of this fact often — particularly when I find myself caught up in the frenetic current of freshmen looking for a party — any party. This current might pull me, barely a minute after I arrive, toward the exit of a sparse HUFPI-sponsored gathering in a random Dunster common room. It might carry me to the porch of a faraway rugby mixer, only to find buff, irritated upperclassmen too distracted to tell us that we won’t get in.
And without fail, the current will take me to Tasty Burger. There I stand, on the corner of Mt. Auburn and JFK St, in a pool of my slightly inebriated peers, all of us fidgeting with our phones, eavesdropping on the bouncer’s conversation with the group that’s arrived just before us. Turns out we can get in by Venmoing some guy five dollars.
We’ve had a long week. It’s Friday night. Isn’t this the time for us to get wasted and partake in classic college debauchery? Haven’t we outgrown loitering in throngs along the river? So we press “pay” and descend into the Tasty Burger basement.
We breathe in the thick, sweaty air, our chests thumping to the beat of Rae Sremmurd’s “Come Get Her.” At first, the whole scene feels novel— a secret party underneath a nondescript burger joint. “The first few times, it was something I just didn't expect — for a club to be in the bottom of a burger place,” says Kai H. Reed ’25. It’s dark enough that the 2010s-era hipster murals adorning the walls are barely visible. The hot ambiance and bass-heavy music almost give you the sense that you’re in a club.
As Alexandra D. Lenzo ’25 recommends, “you just have to get prepared to get sweaty and into the dancing mood.” And I absolutely am. I clasp my friends’ fingers as we drag ourselves into the crowd. We snatch drinks from friends, move our hips and tip our chins up to belt out the song lyrics. Soon, our hair is slicked with sweat, our shirts stick to our skin, and our eye makeup somehow transfers onto each others’ cheeks. Those first few Tasty Burger nights, we’d ascend those steps breathless, feeling like we’d done it: we’d finally found a good party.
As masses of freshmen began flocking to Tasty Burger each week, the space became a dependable party spot. “If I didn’t have anything to do, there was always something at Tasty,” Alma C. Russel ‘25 says.
Christian D. Marinez has been a bartender at Tasty Burger since last fall. To him, the events of each weekend “look like a simulation.” He laughs, “It’s seeing the same faces over and over again. And seeing them do the same thing over and over again.”
But as the year went on, freshmen crowded the basement with such frequency that its luster started to fade. Gabe C. Hostin ’25 reflects, “I’m not gonna lie, after the first three times, I realized, why do I come here to get sweaty and jump around?” To Oreck N. Frazier ’25, the experience of going to Tasty Basement deteriorated “like an overplayed song.” He continued, “People would hear ‘Tasty Basty’ and then be like, ‘What? No, I’m not going to that.’ And they would try to find better things to do.”
At some point toward the end of the fall, the Tasty Burger basement was dubbed “Tasty Basty,” a term uttered with a tone of irony and self-deprecation.
“Tasty is just a gathering of people looking for somewhere to party, but no one really has a purpose. Why Tasty? No one knows. You just go to Tasty,” says Raquel E. Segars ’25. “Then you get downstairs and it's just the same underwhelming group of people not doing anything.”
Kingston H. Herbert ’25 agrees: “90 percent of the time, I don’t enjoy it.”
Evelyn J. Carr ’25 attributes some of her dissatisfying party experiences to her peers’ approach to partying itself. “Everybody has a vision of what they think a college party is going to look like. They want to be seen in a certain place, and they want it to be better than other people’s nights,” she says. “Then when they get there, and it isn’t fulfilling every single expectation that they had, they feel embarrassed to be there and disappointed that it wasn’t what they were hoping for.”
The vast majority of freshmen that I interviewed described that when they first came to college, they harbored unrealistic expectations about the party scene, influenced by the movies they saw growing up or stories from friends at other schools. But even as those expectations are disappointed, we still hold out the hope that we’ll find something fun, so we allow the current to take us to dud parties. When the clock strikes 12, Tasty Burger’s doorway is a bottleneck of shiny-faced, swaying party-seekers desperate to cap off their evening with something.
One or two of my Tasty evenings have passed by in a multicolored, tequila-tinted haze. Others I’ve spent weaving through the greasy mass of predominantly white bodies vertically hooking up. I’ve found myself standing at the bar, bearing witness to yearning eyes darting to various corners of the room, hands running through hair. Side hugs and selfies, swerving hips, and “did we really just pay $5 to be here?”
***
The Tasty Burger basement’s reputation as a dependable party spot for freshmen is a new phenomenon. While an occasional function was held there in the past, upperclassmen never considered it “the move” during their freshmen years.
“I would hear of one-off events there, but now, I hear about it all the time,” Menat N. Bahnasy ’22 says. “I have PAFees who’ll tell me that they're going to Tasty Basty, and the first time I heard that I was like, ‘What on earth is Tasty Basty?’”. When they explained it to her, she recalls, “I was definitely shocked … I had no idea so many events took place there.”
“Tasty Burger definitely wasn’t the spot. I never went to the basement once,” David G. Hill ’23 says. He remembers that the Harvard freshman social scene centered around dorm parties, with the occasional trek to The Pfoho Igloo or The Cabot Aquarium, and he found out about parties held at other schools through the Black community.
Skander K. Fourati ’24 chalks this shift up to Covid policies changing the culture of social life. “The tradition was lost,” he says. “I think freshmen just want to party anywhere, and if there’s no Quad, they end up in Tasty Burger. It just makes sense.”
Reed notes that the inaccessibility of on-campus spaces contributes to his frustration with the freshman social scene. “I feel like Harvard doesn’t have that many great spaces to party at,” he says. “Freshmen obviously can’t get into final club parties.”
Tomi J. Webber ’25 expressed similar dismay. “All of the parties are pretty exclusive in that they’re not widely shared. You have to know someone who knows someone who’s going somewhere and that’s how you get your information,” she says. “Everyone’s always asking around for a move. That whole experience of working to find a party is super underwhelming for me.” Tasty Basty becomes the inevitable fallback.
Hill believes, though, that the freshman party scene has always been underwhelming, pandemic or not. “But if you know where to tap into — if you’re a part of, for example, a club sports team, a cultural organization on campus — there’s definitely a way to have a good time.” Hill highlighted the many successful parties held by cultural organizations such as the Black Students Association.
One Tasty Burger party was enough for Norah R. Ostin ’25, who gravitates toward parties more intentionally advertised to the cultural groups she’s a part of. “I know that they’re the parties I'm looking for, just because there’s a lot more dancing,” Ostin explains. “I’m not going to put myself in the position where I might have fun for, like, five minutes, and then be bored and sitting in the back because they’re playing a song I don’t like.”
By contrast, Segars appreciates the intentionality that goes into BSA parties — the themes, advertising, and hired DJs. “They make real events out of every party,” she says.
Hill agrees and says that the wider Harvard culture pays less attention to the social events of specific cultural groups. “A lot of the cultural orgs on campus do a good job of providing a fun space as well as a fun atmosphere, and I wish more people were able to tap into that,” he says. “But I just think it’s not the focal point of the culture of the institution.”
Maybe the frenetic freshmen current only guides us to the places we’re aware of —the spots we’ve heard about through word of mouth in our fairly insular circles.
Frazier finds that on some Friday nights, “you’re just in a common room with your friends talking, having deep talks. That’s really how I got close with a lot of my friends, instead of going to the parties that I expected to go to.”
And while I’ve had my fair share of raucous, drunken evenings, and I’m sure I’ll have many more, when I look back on my twenty-and-change weeks here at Harvard, those nights don’t even come close to ranking among my most fulfilling experiences.
The more time I’ve spent resisting the current’s pull, the more I’ve found myself in wonderfully random and far more memorable situations. Lightly imbibing and smack-talking my Bananagrams competition in my common room. Flitting about Cambridge Common’s playground to Bobby Womack’s “Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words).” Sitting on a roof and beholding the skyline, imagining the complex, beautiful lives playing themselves out inside of each window.

Estela Lacombe França ’23 spent two years waiting to go on Israel Trek. During her freshman year, she happened to befriend a Trek leader, applied for a spot, and was accepted. When the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the annual trip was forced to take a hiatus. This spring, França was finally able to visit the country she has “always been extremely curious to get to know.”
But this year, the Harvard College Israel Trek, a subsidized spring break trip to Israel and the West Bank, faced backlash from student organizers alleging that Trekkers are “complicit in apartheid and settler colonialism.”
According to Israel Trek’s organizers, the week-long program “aims to engage a diverse cohort of Harvard undergraduate student leaders of all faiths and backgrounds with Israeli history, culture, and politics.” Over spring break, about 100 Harvard students went on the Trek and participated in discussions with high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian officials, including the president of Israel. Participants visited Jerusalem, Bethlehem, the Dead Sea, Nazareth, Tel Aviv, the Sea of Galilee, and the Golan Heights.
However, Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine — a student organization led by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, which advocates for Harvard’s divestment from its holdings associated with Israel’s presence in Palestine — disputes the Trek’s claim that it provides a balanced perspective on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Israel Trek is no stranger to controversy. In 2019, the PSC sponsored a petition to boycott the Trek, prior to its cancellation due to Covid-19 the following spring. In February, HOOP again hung flyers across campus urging students to boycott the Trek, prompting pushback from students and faculty alike — including Harvard Hillel’s executive director, Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg.
During a March 2 sermon at Memorial Church, Steinberg discussed the “war of words on campus,” decrying “the anti-Israel stickers appearing on Sabra hummus in the dining halls, the tearing down of Harvard Hillel posters all over campus, about which the Dean of Students Office had to issue a statement just this past week, and the black-colored posters everywhere against the Harvard College Israel Trek.”
Quoting the PSC’s posters, Steinberg continued, “Maybe you saw the posters on the way here this morning: ‘How about Spring Break without Breaking International Law?’, ‘Your Trip Is Free; Palestine Isn’t,’ and ‘Would you go on a trip funded by South-African Apartheid?’ So far as I know, not one of those posters has been torn down – and let me take a moment here to say that reflects some admirable restraint on the part of Harvard Hillel students.”
“I promise, there is a homily here,” he added, referring to the fact that a considerable portion of his sermon had been devoted to denouncing anti-Trek activism on campus.
Nadine S. Bahour ’22, a representative from the PSC, the group that posted the hummus stickers, says the Sabra boycott stickers were not “anti-Israel.” Rather, she says, they were intended to show that “by purchasing Sabra and providing it to students, Harvard is supporting a company that invests money in the Israeli Defense Forces — specifically in the Golani Brigade,” describing the combat brigade as a historically deadly force that “wipes out villages in Palestine.”
“[The stickers] were asking Harvard students not to eat that hummus to show students that Harvard shouldn’t be supporting ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,” Bahour says.
On Feb. 25, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana released an emailed statement condemning the “disappointing news that posters put up by the Harvard Students for Israel organization were being taken down, and some had additionally been ripped up.” The posters, created by Harvard Students for Israel, included a QR code that linked to an eight-page “Israel Education” document, explaining why the authors “stand with Israel, and why you can, too.”
“The most important thing on this campus is freedom of speech and freedom to put up any posters that you want,” Bahour says. “We obviously did not take down any posters. It’s more powerful to even have all the perspectives that are placed for students to read.”
And despite Steinberg’s assertion that “not one of those [PSC] posters has been torn down,” Bahour says many of her organization’s anti-Trek posters were also removed — sometimes mere hours after they were posted. Neither the DSO statement — nor Steinberg’s sermon referencing it — made any mention of PSC posters being torn down as well.
“When it comes down to the posters, I think [Steinberg’s sermon] really elucidates the bigger topic at hand: that you have an institutionally-backed staff member that’s writing a whole speech about something so minor that a student organization is putting [up],” Bahour says.
She believes that Steinberg mischaracterized the PSC’s actions in his sermon, which “puts PSC at a disadvantage, because we don’t have the resources to be able to have a similar statement or hold a similar event where we share our perspectives,” she says.
Bahour sees this tension as “just another reflection of the reality on the ground, but at a Harvard level.”
“I think that the power imbalance that is lying between Hillel and its backing, versus PSC as a student organization, is only another example of the power imbalance that lies in the region between Palestinians and Israelis, and between attempts of Palestinians to share information and the power that IDF soldiers in the military occupation in Palestine have,” she says.
Steinberg maintains the importance of his platform as a way to share information with the Harvard community.
“Students come to Harvard seeking knowledge and in search of truth, or Veritas, to the degree it is attainable – if it is a ‘power imbalance’ for those here who have knowledge to teach from our learning and experience, so be it,” Steinberg wrote in an email.
After the posters went up, Israel Trek student leader Ty L. Geri ’23 sent an email to the members of the Trek addressing the situation.
“I assume many of you have seen the posters regarding Trek around campus,” he wrote. “We respect their concerns and where they are coming from but disagree with their conclusions about Trek. I reached out to the people who put up the posters and asked to meet and discuss their concerns but unfortunately they have declined my offer.”
Bahour, who is also an organizer within HOOP, says the PSC “didn’t decline talking to the organizers out of not wanting to have a conversation.” Instead, she says their reasons for declining the invitation were twofold.
First, Bahour points to the fact that those extending the invitation were Trek organizers, but the PSC’s campaign was not directed at them. Instead of attempting to educate the people who created the Trek agenda, the PSC aimed to “talk to the students who may not be as aware of what the problems in the agenda are, or what the problems with the trip are,” she says.
But the primary reason that the PSC declined to speak with Geri, Bahour says, was to preserve “the comfort level and safety of the Palestinian students” who would be involved in the discussion.
Bahour says the “power imbalance” stemming from the fact that some organizers are former IDF soldiers was one of the driving factors behind the PSC’s decision to decline his offer to discuss the posters.
“As someone who was born and raised in Palestine in the West Bank, it’s always hard for me to remember that the power imbalances that lie between me and IDF soldiers and me and settlers in the region still exist here today,” she says.
“When we go back [home], the IDF has the power to deny any Palestinian student the right to enter the West Bank,” Bahour says. “We both might be dressed the same and sitting in a dining hall — it does not mean that our experiences and the power that we hold is removed from reality just because we’re in the United States.”
Geri wrote in a statement that “it is really sad” the PSC raised concerns about the safety of Palestinian students in response to his “attempts to listen to them and hear their direct feedback over a coffee.”
“Unfortunately, leaders are too often unwilling to speak to each other and reach compromises in order to ensure mutual dignity and success,” he wrote. “I tried to meet them because I hoped it would be different here at Harvard between fellow students - apparently it is not.”
He added that his invitation to meet about the issue “will always be open.”
In his email to Israel Trek students regarding the posters, Geri also addressed potential concerns from Trekkers who may have been considering dropping out due to the backlash. “Israel Trek is a peer-led and organized trip, and coming on the Trek is not an endorsement of the Israeli government’s policies,” he wrote.
Indeed, some students attended the Trek despite being uncertain of their own stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict — or even because of this uncertainty.
“For me, the backlash served as a jumping-off point to learn more and drove a desire to understand both sides better,” says Trek attendee Elizabeth K. Roosevelt ’25.
França says she believes the Trek did an excellent job of showing participants “how complex the issue is.” Still, she says she respects those who decided to drop out of the trip. “I think people are entitled to make their own determinations about what aligns with their moral views and their opinions of the world,” she says.
Michael Montella ’21-’22, another Trek attendee, says he never considered dropping out.
“The world is full of complexity, and there are things that are challenging to deal with,” he says. “But I don’t think the response to that is to not engage and to not treat things as a learning opportunity.”
It baffles him that “some people think they can understand the complexity of the world without engaging with views they disagree with and find offensive,” he says.
In response to this sort of claim, Bahour says, “I don’t think that you have to visit the region to see the injustice that is happening there.”
“A lot of my friends at Harvard have stances on political situations and on injustices and on humanitarian crises that exist around the world, and we’ve never been to those places,” she says. “It just always seems that when it becomes about Palestine-Israel, it becomes the exception, or it becomes the one place where all the other rules that we have for how we view conflict or where our morals tend to take a backseat.”
Some students dropped out soon after HOOP organizers began protesting the Trek, though their individual reasons for dropping out may have differed. Nonetheless, Geri refutes claims that the Trek offers an imbalanced perspective on the conflict.
“The amazing thing about Trek is that we’re not trying to push an agenda. We’re showing a place as it is,” Geri says.
However, França says that while she believes Palestinian perspectives are included on the Trek, they are not the focus.
“It is Israel Trek,” she says. “I think it’s inherently a trip that is showing you Israel’s position in the world, but the Trek leaders do an absolutely phenomenal job of also showing you what Palestine was like.”
The 2022 Harvard College Israel Trek Resource Guide reads, “In choosing speakers for the program, we try to identify people who will represent dominant narratives in Israeli society. We engage with Palestinians, settlers, left-wing
politicians, right-wing politicians, musicians, activists, and every day people.”
On the Trek, students attended speaking events with: Isaac Herzog, president of Israel; Amir Yaron, governor of the Bank of Israel; Ali Abu Awwad, a Palestinian peace activist; Aida Tome, an Israeli Arab politician; Nasreen Hadad Haj-Yahya, director of the Arab Society in Israel Program at the Israel Democracy Institute; Ofer Shelah, an Israeli journalist and politician; Sabah Mustafa Issa, a professor of human rights; Ronen Manelis, former Israeli Defense Forces Spokesperson; and several Israeli business leaders.
Montella describes the Trek as a valuable “learning opportunity.”
When I ask him whether he believes that hearing from the president of Israel, but not Palestine’s foremost political leaders, reflected a bias on the trip, Montella says that my question implied “there would be a Palestinian president to speak with.”
“It’s not like there would be necessarily an equal counterpart to meet with,” he adds, stating that the Palestinian Authority is “frankly a lack of authority.”
When I inform him that the state of Palestine has a president — Mahmoud Abbas, who has served as the president of the State of Palestine and the Palestinian National Authority since May 2005 — Montella says hearing from the Israeli president “really wasn’t that big of an event.”
“I’m inclined to think that the President of the PA might not have wanted to meet with us,” he then adds.
Montella did not respond to a request to explain the basis for this speculation.
“I don’t believe they would have wanted to engage with the Harvard Israel Trek just like the people boycotting Israel Trek did not want to speak with the leadership of Israel Trek,” he later says.
“I did not create the speaker list,” he adds, and referred me to Trek organizers.
Beyond speaking with towering figures in academia, politics, and industry, it wasn’t all business. Trekkers had the chance to partake in leisure activities throughout the trip, including spending a night in the desert, folk dancing, attending Purim street parties in Tel Aviv, and riding ATVs in the Golan Heights — a region Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981, a move condemned by the United Nations Security Council later that year.
“Camping in the desert was fun. ATV-ing in the Golan Heights was really cool,” says Trek attendee Blake L. Koerber ’24.
Besides spending a semester abroad in Mexico, this was Koerber’s first time out of the United States.
“There were buildings that were abandoned and there were some bullet holes from past conflicts over the years,” he says. “I’ve never been in an area where there was war recently. So that was really cool to me.”
Bahour described the issues she sees with hosting a spring break trip with “fun” activities interspersed with visiting a region with settlements — housing units inhabited by Israeli citizens established on lands occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, a practice the UN deemed illegal under international law.
“Growing up in Palestine, I see what settlers do. And I see the oppression and the colonialism that is enacted by the IDF and by settlements on a daily basis,” she says. “To think that my fellow students are going on a trip where they’re experiencing that reality in a glorified way — where it’s fun to go and visit the region, and it’s totally normal to go and visit a settlement — is definitely something that doesn’t sit well with me, because all that I experience is the oppression of settlements.”
In April, the PSC held an informal roundtable discussion for Trek participants, who had returned from the region three weeks prior. Only five Trekkers showed up.
“How could they use that experience — now that it happened — to better understand the reality on the ground and the reality that the Trek didn’t let them see?” Bahour asks. Though PSC organizers were “disappointed” by the low attendance, moving forward, the PSC hopes to continue outreach efforts to educate students about the conflict.
Bahour has a final request: “For anyone who went on Israel Trek, really spend time thinking about the trip.”

UPDATED: April 26, 2022 at 6:41 p.m.
In late March, we walk into what will be the Harvard Undergraduate Council’s last official meeting — though, of course, we don’t know it at the time.
We find several dozen student representatives gathered around a cluster of faux wood tables in a conference room on the top floor of the Smith Campus Center. Late afternoon light floods in through the floor-to-ceiling windows and lands on furrowed brows. A small group of spectators has come to watch what’s sure to be a contentious meeting of a Council now well-known for its colorful interpersonal conflicts.
The President of the Council, Michael Y. Cheng ’22, looks as though he’s just stumbled into the meeting by chance, with his Harvard Rowing Team t-shirt and slightly ruffled hair. He sits at the front, often getting up to pace as council members debate items on the agenda — or, more often, air their grievances about perceived slights.
There’s scattered applause as Samuel H. Taylor ’24 is voted in as the new Rules Committee Chair; he ran unopposed for a position that had sat vacant for several months.
But mere seconds after he takes office, another council member is already looking to unseat him.
“I move for a vote of no confidence,” they blurt out, to a chorus of groans and giggles. “In the UC constitution, you — ”
“Please don’t use ‘you,’” Michael interrupts, flatly. Under UC rules, personal pronouns are not to be used in floor debate.
The vote of no confidence dies on the floor, and the Council moves on to the first bill on its agenda.
Secretary Jane J. Oh ’24 points to the representatives one at a time to count their votes for the motion. “I got you! … I got you! … I got you!” she says, becoming increasingly frustrated as several inattentive council members fail to put their hands down.
“Please don’t use the term ‘you,’” Michael interjects for the third time in 15 minutes. The room erupts with laughter.
Forty-five minutes of debate later, decorum has dwindled and the sun has set. Michael and Jane are now embroiled in a heated argument.
Some representatives duck out of the room, hoping to catch dinner. Michael and Jane continue to bicker above the smacking of a gavel as the parliamentarian attempts, rather fruitlessly, to maintain order. A council member holding a microphone cuts them all off.
“My d-hall closes in 13 minutes,” the disembodied voice reverberates throughout the conference room. “Y’all are so disrespectful, it’s incredible.”
Michael doesn’t catch the personal pronoun.
With seven bills still remaining on the agenda, including some of his own, Michael decides to call it a night. “You have a right to exercise your First Amendment speech rights. Thank you, and goodnight,” he says. He drops his microphone and exits the room.
The remaining council members raise their hands in incredulity. Some laugh uncomfortably. Several glance at us as if to say, “yeah, it’s that bad.”
Following a history of infighting, inefficiency, and general chaos among the Council, this UC meeting was far from the first of its kind. But it was soon to be the last.
Less than 24 hours later, a referendum question would land in the inbox of every student at Harvard College, asking them whether the school’s 40-year-old student government ought to be scrapped entirely in favor of a new system. Students would turn out in historic numbers to dissolve the Undergraduate Council.
It was the result of months of campaigning by an unlikely actor: the Council’s own president.
***
Everyone at Harvard seems to know Michael Cheng, even if they don’t know him.
You might have received one of his emails updating you on his initiatives, usually signed off with a “Be well, Michael.” You might have heard that he’s a Math and History joint concentrator, a concurrent master’s student in Computer Science, and a Rhodes scholar to boot.
You might also have walked past him in the Science Center Plaza last semester, campaigning for the UC presidency by shouting through a megaphone as Speedo-clad athletes danced beside him. You probably recognize his signature bushy mustache.
And you’ve almost certainly heard other people talking about Michael. What you’ve heard, though, depends heavily on who you’ve asked.
“He was never really leading the UC. It was always him doing whatever he wanted to do to get the job done,” Jane, the Council’s former secretary, says.
“He’s a builder, he’s a creator, and he’s a visionary,” says LyLena D. Estabine ’24, a former Council representative.
“He is someone that has been extremely divisive, and he’s someone that has been extremely hurtful toward the members that he claims to want to work with,” says former Representative Laila A. Nasher ’25. “I don’t think he’s a good leader.”
“Michael Cheng is one of the most conscientious, gentle, and hardworking individuals that I know,” says his close friend, Sam S. Detmer ’20.
“Renaissance man!” says Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of Michael’s professors.
Everyone at Harvard seems to know Michael. Few accounts match up.
“With a lot of people on the UC, they’ve been trying to make controversy around me,” Michael says. “I don’t feel like I’m an inherently controversial personality type.”
In February, we meet Michael for our first interview. He’s slouching on his bed in his Quincy dorm room; we’re at his desk. He speaks in slow, lilting sentences, often pausing to leave a thread hanging in mid-air before picking up another. What was supposed to be a 30-minute interview turns into a two-hour monologue. Conversations with Michael tend to do that.
He tells us how he’s frustrated by the “wackiness” of the UC. He shows us dozens of emails and screenshots, taken by him as well as other members, which he says serve as evidence of the Council’s misconduct.
In later interviews, he would contrast the behavior he saw on the UC with the Harvard motto of “Veritas.” Michael, we quickly learn, has little tolerance for anything he views as dishonest. He prides himself on being a straight shooter, even if that has ruffled some feathers.
“If you’re telling the truth, what do you have to fear?” he asks.
***
Growing up in West Philadelphia as an only child, Michael had to navigate the world largely on his own. His parents “weren’t really involved,” he says.
Michael’s parents, who grew up in poverty during the Cultural Revolution in China, sometimes had trouble adjusting to their new lives after immigrating to the U.S. “There’s a lot my parents didn’t know about,” Michael says, so he had to figure certain things out for himself. In eighth grade, his friend invited him to cross country practice after school. Michael showed up in a collared shirt, thinking he was attending a geography bee.
His parents struggled to make ends meet. They bounced between jobs and often fought over money, sometimes as little as $10. “I didn’t like being at home,” Michael says.
To escape these stressors, Michael made origami, read books, and played fantasy video games — hobbies he still enjoys today.
During an interview, he booted up one of his favorite childhood video games, “Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance,” and provided commentary for our benefit as he played.
A poster of “Fire Emblem” is one of the few decorations that hang on his dorm room wall. The others are a torn map of Pennsylvania and, above his desk, a printed copy of “The True Harvard,” William James’s 1903 speech.
The rest of Michael’s room is similarly sparse; his belongings are stored in cardboard boxes, as though he’s never bothered to unpack. His book collection, on the other hand, is vast — we spot “Mastering Blockchain” and “Famous Origami Boxes” wedged between Hobbes’s “Leviathan” and Plato’s “Republic.”
Though Michael has always excelled at reading, he’s struggled with speech impediments for most of his life. He took speech classes until his junior year of high school, and he made a habit of writing down words and phrases he picked up from conversations and books.
Even now, Michael says, he occasionally mixes up a phrase or two. (He would later tell us, describing Harvard’s pre-professional networking culture, that “some people are trying to make friends with benefits.” We sent him an Urban Dictionary screenshot afterward.)
At home, Michael’s parents primarily spoke Chinese. “My parents really tried to learn English, but it wasn’t that great or helpful,” he says. “But it’s not their fault.”
Kids would call him “ching-chong Cheng” and make fun of his lisps in elementary school, he says, though he quickly adds, “I don’t think they were trying to be malicious. I think it was representing the broader world. That’s what kids do; they soak up the world around them. Even in college life, it influences you.”
For most of his life, Michael says, many saw him as “basically an Asian nerd.”
“Granted, maybe my appearance didn’t help that much,” he adds, telling us that he was obese and wore thick glasses.
At the end of middle school, a friend convinced Michael to take the SAT. His scores attracted the attention of the Drexel High School Scholars program, which invited him to take night classes for free. At Drexel, Michael took courses ranging from health care regulation to water policy to multivariable calculus. It was there, Michael says, that he “came of age.”
Despite his early academic success, Michael says that he’s always “recoiled” from high-achievers. He applied to Harvard, he says, after learning that his tuition would be entirely covered by financial aid if he was accepted, adding: “it was the logical next step if you’re more academically minded.”
Once on campus, Michael took classes “pretty lackadaisically” — “I’ve never been much of a planner,” he says. Rather than follow a particular academic track, he chose a varied and unconventional courseload based on personal interest, including his joint concentration in Math and History. He researched topics ranging from 20th-century Japanese energy history to ancient DNA.
While he excelled at academics, other aspects of college life didn’t come so easily to him. Michael tells us that in freshman year, he was “so socially awkward.”
In one of his first attempts to make friends on campus, Michael didn’t think he’d made the best impression. Later, when he asked someone else for feedback, she told him, “It’s kind of weird to be like, ‘play Settlers of Catan with me’ after 30 seconds of meeting someone.”
Michael says he “wasn’t very happy, to be honest” during his first two years at Harvard. He found himself unequipped for what he calls the “elite” culture on campus. “I remember freshman year, it’s day two, and I’m crying right behind PBHA, in that little courtyard, because it was just so overwhelming.”
One day in his freshman fall, Michael stood in the Science Center Plaza holding cardboard signs that read “Smile! It’s going to be a great day :)” and “YOU ARE INCREDIBLE!” He offered free hugs to passersby. Only three people took him up on the offer.
“Maybe it’s just this kind of area, but it feels kind of cold sometimes,” Michael says.
Although he often had a hard time fitting in among his peers when he was younger, Michael always had a community he could return to. He grew up going to a local African American church. “I have really fond memories from that service,” Michael says. “People from a community singing together, believing in something, having hope.” That sense of community, he says, was something he felt Harvard lacked.
Part of that feeling came from his experience on the UC as a freshman, which Michael joined as a representative in hopes of connecting with others. “It was not a good place to make friends,” he says. “I never went to UC social events, never got invited.”
By the spring of his freshman year, he had started the process of petitioning to transfer to another school. He eventually decided to stay at Harvard, only to be forced off campus at the start of the pandemic in March of 2020. “I was pretty happy to leave, really,” he says.
Michael took full advantage of online school, loading up his schedule with seven classes per semester. However, his home environment wasn’t conducive to his studies, so he petitioned to return to campus — and to his surprise, he found that the reduced-density campus had a much more welcoming culture than the one he’d left.
“I have been infinitely happier during Covid-era Harvard than pre-Covid Harvard,” Michael once wrote in a letter to The Crimson’s Opinion section. “March 10, 2020 is when my stressful, snobby Harvard died.”
It was then that Michael decided it was time for a change. He traded his glasses for contacts and started growing a mustache. “It started because I was too lazy to shave. It just grew out in a month and I was like, ‘Whoa.’”
After a chance encounter with the novice crew coach at a virtual student activities fair, Michael spontaneously decided to walk onto Harvard’s lightweight crew team, despite not knowing how to swim. He taught himself breaststroke through video tutorials and trained with his fellow walk-ons, and he eventually made the cut.
“I was so surprised that I made the team,” he says. “I didn’t think I hit any of the varsity standards — and I didn’t. Obviously, with Covid, it was a flexible year.”
Michael often frames his relationship with the team in terms of gratitude or surprise: “They could have said, ‘Here’s this random Asian guy who walked on. He’s not going to be as good as us at rowing.’” Instead, he says, they “accepted me for who I am.”
That season, he trained as hard and as frequently as he could. “I got near where a lot of the people who got recruited had their times at,” he says.
As one of Michael’s coaches, Dan Boyne, describes him to us: “When he sets his mind to something, he’s like a dog with a bone.”
Michael now spends over 25 hours a week rowing and says that he’s found his closest friends and greater confidence through the sport.
“During that Covid year, there was this idealism that I had,” he says. “It was this idealism that things could be different.”
Michael had served on the UC twice before, once as a freshman representative and again as a junior representative. However, when the November 2021 UC presidential elections rolled around, he had no plans to run.
Several tickets featuring established UC members seemed likely to prevail. Carrying the most momentum was Esther J. Xiang ’23 and her running mate David Y. Zhang ’23, whose campaign Michael had agreed to support. He wanted to see the success of an Asian American woman, he tells us.
However, Esther and David quickly became mired in controversy. Just days before voting was set to begin, their ticket was disbanded by the UC’s election commission, which ruled that they had committed “serious” violations by campaigning early. (Their ticket was eventually reinstated on the eve of voting after the Harvard College Dean of Students Office intervened.)
Michael cited Esther’s disqualification as a personal “turning point,” saying it solidified his view of the UC as an institution with “wacky tricks” and arbitrarily enforced “little rules.” He’d pushed for several adjustments to the UC constitution in the past, though “fundamentally, not much changes,” he tells us. Now, seeing the Council as irreparably “broken,” he was driven to act.
Eleven hours before the application closed, he tossed his hat into the ring to run for president of the body. “I don’t want to go into politics,” he later told us, “but I’ve kind of been thrown into the lion’s den.”
Michael recruited Emmett E. de Kanter ’24, his teammate from crew who had never served on the UC, as his running mate. In his campaign, Michael claimed the UC had lost over $100,000 in grant funding it could not account for (citing a Harvard Open Data Project report), overspent on its retreat to New Hampshire, and took over $2,000 from a grant for diversity, harassment prevention, and mental health initiatives to fund Patagonia sweaters. (A financial audit would later confirm the latter two instances but, due to “unavailability of financial records or inconclusive data,” could not reach a definitive ruling on his claim of the lost $100,000.)
Michael blanketed Harvard’s campus with flyers promising that, if elected, he would “defund” the UC and form a more effective, transparent alternative in its place.
The UC had long suffered from a perception that it was an impotent body made up of slick wannabe politicians, opening it up to satire. This winter, the body’s approval rating rested at a lowly 9 percent, according to a Harvard Political Review survey. Unsurprisingly, then, the Council had seen myriad prank and protest tickets across its 40 years of elections.
“We typically always have a ticket who has some sort of suggestion about a new student government or dissolving the UC,” says Kate T. Colleran, assistant dean of student engagement and leadership and longtime advisor to the UC. “The students don’t often vote for them, but they voted for Michael’s, and I couldn’t tell you really why.”
In 2013, a junior who ran on a platform calling for Harvard to stock thicker toilet paper and serve tomato basil ravioli soup on a daily basis was elected UC president — then resigned immediately, leaving his running mate to lead the Council.
When Michael was a sophomore in 2019, a platform to “abolish the UC” had come very close to winning. Andrew W. Liang ’21 and Aditya A. Dhar ’21 had run satirically, promising to “refill the perpetually empty condom boxes,” “move the Quad back to the Yard,” and sit on Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow’s desk until he agreed to serve their agenda.
“It was a way for us to have a lot of fun,” Liang tells us. Students played along enthusiastically — “I think the majority of the UC at the time actually voted for us,” he says. The pair lost by a thin margin in the ranked-choice election despite garnering the most top-choice votes.
Andrew and Aditya’s platform may have been ironic, but “it planted a seed,” Michael says.
As the election neared, that seed sprouted into a full-fledged platform to dissolve the Council, redistribute its funds back to students, and rewrite its constitution to create a “New Student Government.” Their logo depicted a phoenix rising from a broken UC crest.
After a fraught campaign that saw a slew of allegations ranging from tax fraud to embezzlement — slung against individual candidates as well as the UC itself — Michael and Emmett emerged on top, narrowly beating Esther and David.
Michael, now a senior, was set to graduate at the end of the year. He had just one semester to dismantle a body with four decades of tenure.
The Council, however, wouldn’t go down without a fight.
In late November, closely following Michael’s victory, lame-duck President Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 introduced a constitutional amendment that raised the threshold for a binding referendum, the method by which Michael had proposed to dissolve the Council during his campaign. Instead of requiring a simple majority vote for a referendum to be binding, Noah and Jenny’s amendment stipulated that one half of the total student body, 3,458 students, would have to vote in favor for a measure to pass.
To Michael, the amendment was an inexcusable, “profoundly anti-democratic” move. In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, he labeled it an effort to “undermine the election results.”
The amendment was subsequently replaced by another proposal that set a slightly lower bar: a two-thirds majority in a referendum where two-fifths of students cast a vote. This would require 2,766 students to turn out for the vote — still a high number for a generally apathetic student body. The proposal was adopted on Dec. 3 at an emergency meeting.

“Harvard University claims to produce future leaders,” Michael had written in his op-ed. “But constantly telling young people they’re leaders seems to bring out some of their worst qualities.”
Several weeks later, on the day Michael was inaugurated as the UC’s new leader, he was publicly accused of voter intimidation. Laila, a freshman council member, claimed that he had told her in a private meeting that he would not promote her to a leadership position if she voted for Noah and Jenny’s constitutional amendment.
“Immediately after he said that, I was like, ‘Michael, this is wrong.’ And he told me, ‘Well, I'm being honest about it,’” Laila says.
At the inaugural meeting, Michael had replied, “These allegations are false, and I really apologize if my words have given them the appearance that they are true.”
Yet in an interview, Michael concedes that he did encourage Laila to reconsider her vote, calling it “intellectually inconsistent” for her to join his cabinet after voting for an amendment that would make his primary goal — dissolving the UC — more difficult.
It was around this time, Michael says, that he sought to shield himself from the “he said, she said” attacks levied by his opposition.
Shortly after his inauguration, Michael withdrew from the UC Slack channel, instead opting to communicate with council members through email and only selectively responding to their messages. The divide between Michael’s executive board and the other UC representatives quickly grew.
“Michael seemed absolutely disinterested in working with anyone who didn’t completely align with his worldview,” says Samuel, the former UC rules chair, who, true to his reputation as one of Michael’s loudest critics on the Council, punctuates our interview with colorful expletives. “In fact, I think he was someone who had no interest in being a leader. I don’t think he exhibits any sort of leadership characteristics.”
“One time I tried to speak to him after a meeting,” Samuel adds. “I said ‘Michael!’ and he looked me in the eyes and turned away.”
“I think a few UC members have said that I’ve ignored them. I think that would be accurate,” Michael says matter-of-factly.
Instead of focusing on passing UC legislation, Michael proposed policies directly to Harvard administrators; in the month after his inauguration, he and Emmett met with 36 different school officials.
“I like doing stuff for students. I like talking to administrators about policy,” Michael had told us. “I hate my job on the UC … I don’t care if any of the bills they bring up pass or not.”
His meetings with administrators would eventually contribute to the introduction of several policies, he says, including the proposed expansion of dining hall offerings and the introduction of “Research SnackChats” between thesis writers and students interested in research. He was also a vocal supporter of double concentrations, which students and faculty had long advocated for and were finally approved this April.
But his critics claim that Michael purposefully bogged down the club funding process, citing his decision to shorten the body’s general meeting duration. “At the end of the day, the most important thing the UC ever did was fund clubs,” says Samuel. “For him to deliberately try and to prevent the Council from passing the club funding pack was pretty shameful.”
“We have clubs that have members that have literally thousands of dollars in credit card debt,” says Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23, a former UC representative, regarding the undisbursed grants.
But Michael maintains that the delays in club funding was a structural issue that has long been part of the UC. In a written statement, he blames the backlog on the inordinate burden put on the role of treasurer and the consistently late opening of grant applications.
Even as Michael led the UC through unilateral action, he publicly declared his commitment to representing the student body through direct democracy. This paradox became particularly apparent when he launched Crimson OpenGov, an app that solicits anonymous opinions from the student body to help propose actions to administrators. The app had initially died as a bill within the UC, so Michael chose to independently develop the platform with some of his friends, drawing the ire of other UC members.
“Oftentimes, I felt he tried to circumvent UC input, feedback, or collaboration,” says Jane. He made her job as secretary particularly stressful, she says, as she was forced to mediate between Michael and the other UC members.
“Michael will do anything it takes to get what he wants done. And he’s really good at that; it’s really effective,” she says, adding, “I don’t think the ends justif[y] the means.”
At the heart of Michael’s solo approach was his belief that he had been fundamentally wronged by his peers on the Council, who’d voted to pass Noah and Jenny’s amendment. “They made the choice to try to undermine the election results and play games, and so if they’re willing to make up, I’m happy to work with them — but they’ve got to do that,” Michael said in February after launching the OpenGov app.
“There’s been a bit of a disconnect between Michael’s team and the rest of the council,” Owen O. Ebose ’25 said at the time. “I liken it to being two councils, almost.”
Emmett, like Jane, often played the role of mediator; he presided over the end of the UC’s last-ever meeting after Michael walked out, earning praise from some other council members. Emmett believes that the conflict between Michael and the other council members largely stemmed from Michael’s “strong ideals.”
“I think he can be especially upset and surprised when people don’t hold themselves to [his] standard,” Emmett says.
Others take a less sympathetic view.
“His political goals were always ahead of the student body, and always ahead of the Council,” Ivor says.
On February 14, Michael woke up to find two flyers posted on his door that called him an anti-Asian slur. “SAVE THE UC,” they read.
That afternoon, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association released a statement of solidarity. Twenty-four student organizations signed on in support, followed by 12 pages of students’ names.
The Council sent a private statement of support to the leader with whom they had so often clashed. The incident might have been an opportunity to start anew, to reconsider the stakes of their past discord.
But at their meeting the following night, Michael made it clear that unity was out of the question.
“I don’t support the statement of solidarity,” he said in his opening speech. “I think we need to have some tougher conversations first before I would support that statement.”
He went on to lay out a series of grievances against the Council — chief among them his belief that in characterizing him as “competent but cutthroat,” they were perpetrating similar racist stereotypes as the ones they claimed to condemn.
“We’re now supposed to take seriously that the Undergraduate Council is offended by anti-Asian racism, with many of its members engaged in a multi-month harassment campaign that was influenced by anti-Asian stereotypes,” he said.
Near the end of his speech, Michael aired a suspicion he first shared with The Crimson the day before: “The person or people that are responsible for yesterday’s hateful attack, as well as the multiple kinds of other attacks targeting me, are potentially in this room right now.”
Michael offered no corroborating evidence for the accusation, which did little to endear him to his critics on the Council. “Very disappointing reflection on whoever did it,” Samuel says of the perpetrators who posted the flyers, “but I think the way that he immediately turned around and tried to use it was also disappointing.”
The Harvard University Police Department investigated and has since closed the case, though it did not disclose its findings.
Later that week, Michael tells us he’s been making an effort to attend more Bible study groups on campus. “I’m trying to learn to forgive people,” he says. “I think my initial reaction was definitely not really as forgiving.” All he wants, he tells us, is an apology.
Michael’s proposed replacement for the Undergraduate Council was called the Harvard Undergraduate Association, whose constitution was cobbled together by a randomly-selected “Citizens’ Assembly” in about 2 months. While the UC was composed of 54 representatives of different dorms, the HUA constitution calls for just two co-executives and seven officers leading teams of student volunteers. Each team would work on initiatives relating to a specific area of college life — an issue-focused approach, Michael says, that would reduce infighting and serve as a “breath of fresh air” to the toxicity of the UC.
Others criticized the proposed constitution, citing a lack of checks and balances as well as reduced representation of the student body.
Michael largely dismissed these concerns. While he admits the document isn’t perfect — “there are gonna be issues; you’re gonna have constitutional amendments” — he says, laughing, that “it couldn’t be worse than the UC.”
The decision on whether to dissolve the UC and replace it with the HUA was put up to a school-wide referendum at the end of March. As Michael ramped up his campaigning, he decided to apologize for a criticism that he’d received over the previous months. Some argued that his use of the slogan “defund the UC” co-opted language from the Black Lives Matter movement, conflating the importance of an effort to dismantle systems of racial oppression with that of the dissolution of a student government.
“I do remember being a little bit put off by the term ‘defund’ used in a student government election context, especially as a Black woman,” LyLena tells us. “It made me uncomfortable, and I think it made other people uncomfortable.”
Michael changed his slogan to “reimagine Harvard,” and he released a public apology video with Emmett. But this time, it was Michael’s turn to have his olive branch rebuffed. The apology — conveniently timed right as voting on the referendum was set to begin — largely failed to address his opponents’ criticisms.
“That is one of the most disingenuous apologies that I have ever seen,” former UC Representative Jada Pierre ’25 said of the video.
***
Once the referendum officially opened, Michael and his opponents geared up to focus on its biggest obstacle: meeting the 2,766 voter threshold.
Hoping to suppress voter turnout to below the required 40 percent, an anonymous Instagram account, @HarvardKnowYourVote, urged disapproving students to boycott the vote. “Voting ‘No’ on the HUA referendum could help it pass,” one post reads. “Don’t let it.”
Michael campaigned aggressively, personally handing out flyers and sending frequent emails to the student body with updates on the vote count: “Never want to hear about UC drama again? Vote Yes!”
We met up with Michael for an interview for this story a few days after the referendum opened. Erg season with the crew team was in full swing, and he was significantly thinner than the last time we’d seen him, his hands blistered and raw.
We asked him about the prospects of the referendum passing. He was confident that it would, citing several statistics he’d gathered himself. “Realistically, if this doesn’t pass, both Emmett and I are gonna resign that night, and they can figure out what they want to do,” he tells us. “It’s like, we tried. Thank you, Harvard. We’re leaving.”
The night before voting closed, Michael sent us his prediction: “I expect 55-58% turnout with 70-75% voting yes.”
Shortly after 5 p.m. the next day, the results were out — and Michael’s estimates were almost exactly correct. Turnout was a historic 57 percent of the student body, 76 percent of whom voted to dissolve the UC. The Council’s 40-year reign had come to a close.
Just one week before, Michael had told us that he would resign if his core campaign promise failed. Now, he was triumphant.
***
But on April 5, one week after the UC’s dissolution, Michael resigned anyway.
He told us it was because he didn’t think that the HUA elections “should be about me,” adding, “I am the past. The HUA is the future.”
But what exactly that future entails is still unknown. At the time of writing, the HUA’s first elections are just now taking place. The body lacks any bylaws to organize its day-to-day operations, which filled a significant portion of the UC’s 21,682-word governing document. All that is truly known is that the new body will be led by nine officers elected by ranked-choice vote — and that they have a lot of work ahead of them.
“When students voted on this referendum, they were more focused on ‘the UC is annoying. The UC is toxic,’” Jane says. “The question that really should have been asked is, ‘is the HUA a good replacement?’ and not, ‘is the UC bad?’”
In his parting email to the student body, Michael writes that he is looking forward to “getting lost in used bookstores, playing video games like Tales of Symphonia and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and spending time with friends and teammates.” The email is titled “Our next chapter.”
“I have this sense of destiny,” he later tells us. “It’s like my life is like a book that’s already been written. And I have no idea what the pages ahead are. I’m not allowed to flip ahead. But I live through the pages, the words on each line, very viscerally.”
He concludes his resignation email with a quote from William James’s “The True Harvard,” the speech that hangs above his desk:
“As a nursery for independent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Harvard still is in the van. Here they find the climate so propitious that they can be happy in their very solitude. The day when Harvard shall stamp a single hard and fast type of character upon her children, will be that of her downfall. Our undisciplinables are our proudest product. Let us agree together in hoping that the output of them will never cease.”
Below the quote, Michael attaches a pensive portrait photograph of himself looking off into the distance.
For our last interview with Michael, we returned to his room. Again, we sit facing him as he reclines on his bed.
Two months ago, he’d shown us screenshots of emails and Instagram posts, periodically going off on tangents about the function of democracy. This time, he’s eating ice cream cake from his resignation party. “Yesterday was the best day of my life,” he tells us.
Michael reflects on his UC presidency. Initially, he says, he had a lot of hope. “There are a lot of cultural things I wanted to do,” he says, “like consensus-based agreement or giving hugs when you come in.” There’s not a hint of irony in his voice.
“But the culture that had been on the UC for so long was completely negative,” he continues. “Once you already have [an] established culture and established system, it’s really hard to actually change that culture.”
And yet, many of his peers claim that it was Michael himself who perpetuated much of that negative culture. “I think that Michael did contribute to the toxicity and divisiveness of the UC,” Jane says. “There was a lot of mistrust.”
“Michael, to me, is someone profoundly driven by pride and reputation,” Samuel says. When we ask Samuel why he thought Michael was so dedicated to the UC’s dissolution, he says, “truth be told, I think Michael wanted to leave a legacy behind.”
But whatever legacy Michael may leave has come at the expense of others’.
“As plain as it may sound, I’m very sad,” Daniella M. Berrospi ’24, the UC’s former finance committee chair, tells us the night the referendum results came out. She sighs. “I’m trying to come to terms with the fact that the job that I’ve put so much time into for about a year and a half now is gone. It’s just wiped away.”
We ask Michael if all the strife was worth it.
“Yeah, I would think so,” he says, citing the remarkably high voter turnout for the referendum: “I think we got students to actually care about their university.”
He adds, “Obviously, I think there were mistakes made. There were decisions I definitely would have thought about differently.”
He doesn’t elaborate on what these are.
***
Thirty minutes after Michael resigns from the UC, we join him on his way to crew practice, making small talk as we walk to the boathouse. There comes a lull in the conversation, but after so many hours of interviews over the past couple of months, it isn’t awkward.
After a while, Michael breaks the silence. “I feel so free,” he says.
Michael is the stroke, a technically demanding position in front of the rest of the rowers. From the front of the boat, he sets the pace and the others must match him — “even if I’m wrong,” he chuckles.
As his group gets ready to get in the water, they walk over to a boat resting on the ground. Michael is hunched over, his arms wrapped around the bow, ready to lift the boat at any moment. “Mike, you can relax,” his coach tells him. Michael grins sheepishly and releases his grip.
The rowers are largely silent throughout the two hours of practice on the water. The setting sun outlines their silhouettes and casts the tips of their oars in an orange glow.
They paddle with Michael in the front, their backs to the direction they are rowing. As the boat moves steadily onward, disturbing the stillness of the Charles, it leaves trails of ripples in its wake.

On March 7, when Harvard College announced that it would suspend its indoor mask mandate a week later, Melissa M. Shang ’25 feared for her life. Shang was born with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited disorder that impacts her lung function. If she contracts Covid-19, her case will likely be severe and potentially fatal.
For Shang and other immunocompromised students, campus policies have much higher stakes than just comfort. “The most frustrating part that I’ve had conversations about with people who don’t want the mask mandate has just been me being like, ‘I have this condition. I would basically die if I got Covid,’” Shang says. “And then people are like, ‘Yeah, but that’s your issue, not ours.’”
In January, a Harvard University Health Services Covid guidance update stated: “By continuing to mask, distance, test regularly, and minimize close contact, we can maintain a safe academic, research, and work environment for everyone.” Less than two months later, the University’s messaging changed. Masking is now a personal decision, and while vulnerable individuals “should continue to wear a mask,” others might choose to do so only if they are worried about their own well-being or that of someone close to them.
In the March 7 email, administrators cited declining case rates and the concurrent relaxation of Covid restrictions at state and local levels in their decision to suspend the mask mandate. “There have been very few hospitalizations and no Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions this year,” the email said, adding that the risks posed by Covid “can be managed effectively with less intrusive measures than before.”
Harvard’s Covid policies are informed by the University Coronavirus Advisory Group, which comprises public health and medical experts. In response to a request for comment, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton referred to several previous Covid guidance updates, as well as a Harvard Gazette interview with two members of the UCAG, following the University’s April 25 announcement that it would transition to optional Covid testing over the next few weeks.
In the Gazette interview, Harvard Medical School professor Michael Klompas cites successful vaccine mandates and the “large number of community members” who have recovered from Covid as factors in the Advisory Group's decision to recommend optional testing.
“The things that we did during the early stages of the pandemic to save lives, that made perfect sense at the time when there was a much higher threat of hospitalization and death, turned out to be onerous and obstructive to community life, to education, to research, to the social mission of the University,” Klompas says.
Newton did not directly respond to a question about whether disabled or immunocompromised people are represented in or consulted by the UCAG.
This rhetorical shift — along with the conversations Shang described and the mantra that everyone is going to get Covid eventually — symptomize the transformation of pandemic safety from a communal question to an individual one, leaving the responsibility to fall on immunocompromised students. Of course, studies consistently show that wearing a mask protects others from Covid; and some people cannot afford to get Covid eventually, because they will die.
More than 7 million Americans are on immunosuppressive drugs to treat diseases like cancer, and countless more have underlying conditions that weaken their immune system or make vaccines ineffective. This means that Covid safety is also an issue of disability justice. It complicates the picture of classrooms in a newly unmasked world, particularly since it may not be possible to tell that someone is immunocompromised just by looking at them, and students who are at high risk may not be willing to share that information.
One immunocompromised student, who requested that he not be named, keeps his condition private and managed it on his own for years, saying that his condition is not “immediately apparent” to people. Now, he is at a standstill with Covid making it even more unmanageable to deal with on his own.
“If this were a thing where you could entirely protect yourself individually, that’s fine,” he says. “But it’s a transmittable virus. It’s not like that.” He describes having to maintain a limited circle of small social groups: “It’s fine like that. That is what it is.”
Under the new policies, instructors can choose whether to require masking in their classrooms. Professor Bethany A. Burum says she has asked her psychology seminar to continue wearing masks, since she is pregnant. Students have been “gracious” about honoring the request, she says.
By contrast, in professor Jennifer L. Hochschild’s class, General Education 1052: “Race in a Polarized America,” masking is optional. For the first few weeks, she says, most students continued to wear masks, but many of them have stopped. Hochschild does not wear a mask when she lectures, since she finds it harder to speak effectively, and she believes some students have moved farther back in the classroom as a result. She has given students multiple channels to express discomfort with the policy, including anonymously through a teaching fellow. No one yet has done so.
Shang says that regardless of the existence of a mask mandate, but particularly in its absence, Harvard needs to offer some kind of virtual option for students who do not feel safe attending class in person, because they are more vulnerable to Covid or need accommodations for a different reason. This kind of adaptability should not be hard to come by, she says; Harvard was almost entirely virtual for about a year and a half. “Once the pandemic started, virtual options suddenly became the norm,” Shang says, but now, “disabled students and people with disabilities who have jobs are once again struggling to get the flexibility and the virtual options that we need.”
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers president Koby D. Ljunggren, a Ph.D. student, says the flexibility they were given during this time to work or attend classes from home was vital. “I finally felt like I had access to education, and I didn’t have to miss out on education because I experienced life a bit differently,” they say.
But as Harvard has tried to return to normal, in the newfound absence of a campus wide policy requiring remote classes, such options vary. Students in Burum’s seminar have joined via Zoom if they are sick, which works for occasional absences but inhibits participation: “I don’t have a special microphone setup or anything,” she says. “It’s literally just my computer.” While recordings of Hochschild’s lectures are made available to students taking the course concurrently through the Harvard Extension School, HES policy prevents her from allowing her own students blanket access to the recordings. Students who miss a class may request individual recordings through the Extension School. During past Covid waves, Hochschild says, this “bureaucratic” system was overwhelmed by the sheer number of absences, so she asked her head Teaching Fellow to start emailing the videos directly to students.
Generally, students with accessibility needs register through the Accessible Education Office, which works with them to provide accommodations. In response to an interview request, the AEO forwarded a written response from Harvard spokesperson Alixandra A. Nozzolillo. “While it is the case that Harvard College transitioned, temporarily, to remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic, that transition took place across the entire curriculum for all students,” Nozzolillo wrote. “This meant that pedagogy was tailored to remote instruction for all participants, whereas now it is again tailored to in-person learning.”
Some disabled students have criticized the AEO as sluggish or unhelpful. “When you have a disability and you ask for accommodations,” Ljunggren says, the AEO can often “outright” deny requests.
“There are occasions where folks will ask for accommodations, and they’ll say, ‘That’s too extreme, maybe you should take a leave of absence,’” they say.
Shang, who is the co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Disability Justice Club, describes having asked a professor to provide a virtual class option and being told she should go through the AEO. When she asked the AEO, she says, she was told virtual options were up to the discretion of professors. “You’re just constantly passing me to other people who also can’t do anything,” she says. “What do you expect me to do?”
Nozzolillo wrote that the College cannot comment on specific requests for accommodations.
In response to the lifting of the mask mandate, six Harvard organizations, including the Disability Justice Club and HGSU-UAW, and more than 170 students signed onto an open letter arguing for the mandate to be reinstated within classrooms. It was distributed to multiple student organizations and student house mailing lists.
Tessa Green, a biophysics Ph.D. student who co-wrote the letter, expresses frustration over the mask mandate being lifted, saying it seemed the decision was made based on the desires of a “pool of low-risk individuals” rather than prioritizing an “open access to campus for anyone who wants to be there,” leaving campus less safe for individuals who are high risk or disabled.
Ljunggren says the decision was made without consulting “folks on the ground,” but rather by “stakeholders at the top of the university”; the announcement of the end of the mandate came during a large spike in positive Covid cases among undergraduates.
Though several student organizations signed the letter, many others, including advocacy groups, did not. .
For Shang, what she sees as the disregard for the lives of disabled and high-risk peers has not gone unnoticed. “You have to be concerned about this,” she says. “Because if you aren't then I and my friends and other at-risk people on campus are being left to possibly die.”
With the relaxed mask mandate, other pandemic policies have been changed as well. In March, Harvard announced it would end its Coronavirus Workplace Policies, limiting the number of days employees can use to care for dependent family members who are ill or need to isolate. Harvard also no longer provides additional time off benefits that can be used to care for immediate family members whose care or school schedules are affected by Covid. Family medical leave and paid sick time remain.
Ljunggren says that they are not asking or expecting people to wear masks indefinitely. But Harvard’s accomodations — flexible work, remote classes — should be treated as permanent steps toward accessibility, rather than as temporary concessions to a pandemic, they say. “From the union angle, a lot of these positive changes that have taken place in our workplace are more accommodating,” they say. “We don’t want to see this go away. We should reckon with the old normal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Child psychiatric epidemiologist Tamsin Ford discussed Covid-19’s impact on childrens’ mental health at a virtual research presentation hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health on Wednesday.
Based out of the University of Cambridge, Ford researches the effectiveness of mental health services and interventions aimed at children and young adults. Wednesday’s event was part of the Population Mental Health Forum Series hosted by HSPH professor Karestan Koenen.
Ford began by highlighting the drawbacks of three systematic reviews conducted by McGill University, which screened the abstracts of over 90,000 research papers. The reviews examined changes in mental health throughout the pandemic, factors driving these changes, and intervention strategies.
“The McGill team were more focused on adults at the beginning, and they are only looking at emotional disorders,” Ford said. “I think there’s a real issue about behavior, peer relationship, and prosocial skills.”
Ford continued by explaining the results from a systematic review conducted at the University of Cambridge, which identified 51 studies helpful for understanding children’s mental health amid Covid-19.
“Children who were doing really well pre-pandemic experienced a drop in prosocial skills and peer relationships, whereas those who were struggling prior experienced better peer relationships and more prosocial behavior, which is really intriguing,” Ford noted of the review.
Ford also discussed similar findings from a report published by the Harvard School of Public Health that collected mental health data from 13- and 14-year-old students across 17 schools between 2019 and 2020. The report found improvements among students struggling with depression before pandemic.
“Overall, there was no difference on their mental health measures between the two times in the whole population,” Ford said. “But when you split it by mental health pre-pandemic … you can see that those who were struggling are doing better.”
She observed a similar trend in measures of anxiety and well-being.
Shifting focus to the impact of Long Covid — recurring health issues after Covid-19 — on children’s mental health, Ford introduced the preliminary results of a study that tracked over three months the physical and mental health of children aged 11 to 17 in England who tested either positive or negative for Covid-19. The study aimed to see if Long Covid impacted the health of children who tested positive compared to their peers who tested negative.
“These young people who were struggling were more likely in both groups to be girls rather than boys, to be older teens rather than early adolescents, and to have had poor baseline physical and mental health,” she said.
Referencing the Mental Health of Children and Young People national surveys in England, Ford also described overall patterns in mental health metrics across gender and racial groups.
“Young women seem to be doing particularly badly and had a particularly sharp deterioration initially,” Ford said. “There was a sharp sudden deterioration that’s maintained amongst the white population, whereas ethnic minorities are experiencing a more steady deterioration.”
Ford concluded that the rise of mental health issues in children are concentrated within particular groups, such as those who are struggling financially or have pre-existing mental health conditions.
“One in six may be struggling in the UK, but that means five in six are not,” she said. “So we shouldn’t panic, and we should think about universal indicated and targeted responses.”

A research team led by Harvard scientists discovered triggers for the hyperinflammation accompanying severe Covid-19 cases in a study published in Nature on April 6.
Scientists at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital collaborated to produce the findings, which revealed connections between infected immune cells, respiratory problems, and organ damage.
Judy Lieberman ’69, a co-author of the study and HMS professor, said no prior research had explored the link between inflammation and Covid-19.
“It’s well recognized that inflammation, and something called cytokine storm — which is an extreme form of inflammation — is at the root of severe Covid, but nobody knows how it got triggered, or why,” Lieberman said.
The study found that Covid-19 infects monocytes and macrophages, white blood cells that respond to infection by identifying antibodies surrounding the virus and, afterward, taking up the virus — a process that results in programmed cell death, or pyroptosis.
Pyroptosis releases inflammatory molecules that are linked with organ failure and excessive blood clotting, especially among older patients or patients with comorbidities.
Caroline Junqueira, an HMS researcher who co-authored the study said these bodily responses could best be characterized as “immunopathology,” in which the body “becomes the disease itself.”
Junqueira added that despite the negative effects of pyroptosis, it can still be a protective mechanism through warding off viral replication because it is faster than the replication process.
“Cell death is really fast,” she said. “It’s much faster than virus life cycles.”
Although not every viral infection leads to pyroptosis, pyroptosis in Covid-19-infected cells is a “dead end for the virus,” according to Junqueira.
Junqueira added that future studies could tackle the relationship between immune response and Long Covid, in which symptoms persist long after infection.
“[Long Covid] is a persistent inflammation — a systemic inflammation,” Junqueira said. “What we are planning to do now is to try to understand if [these] inflammatory monocytes are actually playing a major role.”
Lieberman added that the study could be important for designing future Covid-19 treatments.
“People designing both vaccines and antibody therapies should really consider not only whether the antibodies block or neutralize infection, but they should also consider the other functional properties of the antibody,” Lieberman said.
These “functional properties” could inform decisions about Covid-19 health policy and therapy going forward, Lieberman said.
“People have to really understand the science and what’s known, and keep working to understand more in order to devise the best therapies and not be prejudiced without understanding the data,” she said.

Author and journalist Peter B. Hessler spoke about his experiences as a Peace Corps volunteer in China while delivering the 2022 S.T. Lee Lecture at the Harvard Institute of Politics on Wednesday evening.
The lecture, named for Singaporean businessman and philanthropist Lee Seng Tee, was introduced by Kennedy School professor Fredrik Logeval, who described its focus as exploring how “geopolitical developments might shape global approaches to policymaking.”
Hessler, a staff writer at the New Yorker who has authored several bestselling books on China, first traveled to the country with the Peace Corps in 1996. He taught English in Fuling, China, for his two years in the Corps before joining the New Yorker, eventually leaving China in 2007.
Hessler returned to China in 2019 to teach nonfiction writing at Sichuan University.
Throughout the event, he spoke about the changes between his two stints in the country — many of which he said were manifested by his students, reflecting China’s rapid urbanization and the effects of the one-child policy.
“Even from the very beginning, the difference was so striking,” he said. “In the old days, almost all of my students came from the countryside. For example, I taught my nonfiction class, not one of them was from a rural background.”
Similarly, only one of Hessler’s students during his time in the Peace Corps was from a one-child family, he said, but “there was only one kid with siblings” when he surveyed a class of freshmen in 2019.
Hessler also described the upward mobility that has allowed for the growth of a new middle class in the country over the last two decades. Graduates could expect to make about $500 a year back then, he said. In years since, that has dramatically changed.
“In 2014, when I surveyed them, the median household income was nearly $18,000. And last year, when I asked the question again, it had risen to $35,000,” he said.
Still, when Hessler asked his former students in 2014 to define their social class, many “defined themselves with terms like proletariat, low-class, down-class, poverty class, poor,” he said.
“One wrote, ‘we belong to nothing,’” he said.
Hessler attributed the responses to the long-term impact of poverty.
“I think that the experience of being poor stays with people,” he said. “They don’t feel necessarily as prosperous as we might expect.”
Hessler said the United States’ current diplomatic relationship with China is “pretty terrible” but said he was glad to see Chinese students still coming to the U.S.
“We should be more confident about being open with exchanges,” he said. “I don’t think we have anything to lose.”

Experts in neuroscience and law discussed the legalization of cannabis and highlighted its implications for public policy at a virtual panel hosted by Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics on Wednesday.
The event, jointly hosted with Massachusetts General Hospital’s Center for Law, Brain and Behavior, featured neuroscientist Yasmin Hurd and was moderated by forensic psychologist and attorney Stephanie Tabashneck. Petrie-Flom Center Executive Director Carmel D. Shachar introduced the panel.
Hurd began by describing the science of cannabis and cannabidiol, speaking on the potential adverse effects of marijuana use by young people, whose brains have not fully developed. She also discussed the future of treating substance use disorders, advocating for a shift away from the criminal justice system.
In an interview after the event, Shachar criticized the reliance on the criminal system to regulate marijuana in the United States, saying it “was too one size fits all” and “too harsh on certain people.”
“It really burdened communities of color in ways I think were unjust and inequitable,” she said.
Shachar added that in “an era of more individual choice around marijuana,” it is important for people to rely on experts to understand how the drug will affect their body.
“You want to be a really good custodian of your brain,” she said. “You want to be a friend to your brain.”
Tabashneck said in an interview after the event that neuroscience can be a useful tool to humanize those who practice substance use. She noted displaying brain scans has helped her to change the perception of substance use disorders in the courtroom by underscoring their validity as medically-based illnesses.
“It seemed to shift the way that lawyers and judges were understanding addiction and led to more compassion and empathy,” Tabashneck said. “So I see neuroscience as a vehicle for understanding.”
Tabashneck added that neuroscience provides a sense of hope for those facing or trying to treat substance use disorders.
“I also really like neuroscience because in this field, in particular, I think there’s a lot of hope,” she said.
“We know that for people who have substance use disorders 一 that the brain can heal over time,” Tabashneck added. “And I think that message is really important: those people who have an addiction get better.”
Tabashneck said she hopes to help reduce stigma around addiction and stop “unnecessary cruel” attitudes towards those struggling with substance use disorders.
“What we know from the research is we get better outcomes when we treat people with substance use disorders with respect and dignity,” she said.

When Harvard released a set of proposed changes to its sexual harassment, non-discrimination, and anti-bullying policies two weeks ago, a new definition of consent was one of the key changes.
The new policies, if adopted by the University’s highest governing board, would define consent as an “active, mutual agreement” — a stark departure from the University’s current policies, which require only “agreement, assent, approval, or permission” through words or actions.
But two weeks into an open comment period in which affiliates are invited to give feedback on the proposed policies, some have taken issue with the word “active” in the new definition.
The proposed changes are the product of a set of working groups convened by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in January 2021 that sought to assess Harvard’s interim Title IX and sexual misconduct policies and draft new anti-bullying and non-discrimination procedures.
Some student advocates on campus welcomed the proposal as a step in the right direction but said the school should adopt a standard of “affirmative” — not “active” — consent.
Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization, said in a statement the “language within the definition is unclear and troublesome.”
“Our concern is that ‘active,’ while it may make intuitive sense to people for a model of healthy sexual interaction, does not have as clear a definition as affirmative,” William M. Sutton ’23, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, wrote in a follow-up email. “Specifically, we’re concerned about the term’s reversibility. ‘Not affirmative’ means communicating ‘no’ through words or actions, while the meaning of ‘not active/inactive’ is less clear.”
But Brett A. Sokolow, the president of the Association of Title IX Administrators, said the wording change would make little substantive difference. The dispute over “active” and “affirmative” consent, he said, creates “a false juxtaposition.”
“If you already have a consent-based policy — and you just revised the consent-based policy — then your consent-based policy is already affirmative,” he said.
“I don’t object to it, but I just don’t think it’s necessary, because [affirmative] is a modifier that already is baked in,” Sokolow added.
The proposed definition of consent also includes a new provision stating that “consent is not voluntary if it is obtained by coercion,” defining coercion as conduct “that would reasonably place a person in fear of immediate harm, and that is employed to compel someone to engage in sexual activity.”
Max G. Ehrenfreund, a History of Science Ph.D. candidate who served as a member of the working group on interim Title IX and other sexual misconduct policies, said the coercion definition is “too narrowly defined.”
“Forms of sexual misconduct that obviously violate the spirit of this policy would have to be regarded as acceptable by the University,” he said.
Ehrenfreund also took issue with the proposed definition of quid pro quo harassment, which only encompasses Harvard employees as currently written. The policy, he said, would not apply to students who may hold leadership positions in extracurricular organizations, but are not employed by the University.
Some affiliates also criticized the draft policies on discrimination and bullying for being too constrained.
Researcher Kelsey M. Tyssowski, a member of the anti-bullying working group, said she hoped to see the policies elaborate more on informal conflict resolution given that many affiliates who allege misconduct do not file formal complaints.
Bailey A. Plaman, a Chemical Biology graduate student who serves as a co-chair of the graduate student union’s Feminist Working Group, said she was “disappointed” to see the anti-bullying and non-discrimination policies modeled off of Harvard’s interim Title IX policies, which are required to meet federal regulations. The union has long argued Harvard’s policies for sexual harassment and misconduct are opaque and ineffective.
Harvard put in place interim Title IX policies in August 2020 after the Trump administration rewrote federal guidelines. The Biden administration has signaled that it will soon roll back the Trump-era changes, leaving individual schools’ policies in flux.
“A lot of the reasons the policies are the way they are, at least Harvard argues, is because of Title IX law — but anti-bullying and non-discrimination are not subject to Title IX,” Plaman said.
Harvard affiliates will be able to comment on the proposed policies through September.
“The University welcomes robust dialogue and conversation around all aspects of these proposed policies to continue to shape how they are finalized,” University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain said in a statement.

In its storied history, Harvard has played 1,342 football games, winning roughly 68 percent of the time it takes the field. Of all of its opponents, it has lined up against Yale the most times, facing the Bulldogs 137 times in the rivalry known as The Game. But, starting in 2023, it will add a new opponent to its ledger; the team announced via its Instagram account on April 12 that it will play a home-and-home series against the University of St. Thomas, beginning with a clash at Harvard Stadium on Sept. 16, 2023, and ending at O’Shaughnessy Stadium in St. Paul, Minn., on Sept. 15, 2029.
Although few teams have a history as long as the Crimson’s, the Tommies first competed in 1904 and have also taken the field more than 1,000 times. St. Thomas was one of the inaugural members of the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in 1920 and, since then, has won twenty MIAC championships, including seven in its last ten seasons. It achieved its pinnacle of success in 2012, when it finished as the national runner-up in Division III, repeating its feat in 2015. The Tommies have produced quite a few notable alumni, including Seattle Seahawks general manager John Schneider and Vince Lombardi Jr, the eldest son of the late NFL legend. Head Coach Glenn Caruso took the reins at St. Thomas in 2008, and has since been named National Coach of the Year six times at the Division III level. After winning 35 out of its 36 home games between 2014 and 2019, it joined Division I prior to the 2021 season.
After making the leap to the top flight, St. Thomas found success in its first season at the Football Championship Series (FCS) level. Last year, it claimed a 12-9 victory at Michigan Tech in its first top-level game on Sept. 11. Overall, it finished 7-3, with its 6-2 record within the Pioneer League good enough to tie for third in the conference. The Tommies won on the strength of their defense, which allowed opponents to score just 17.80 points per game in 2021, 0.40 points more than Princeton’s 12th-ranked unit.
“They went right into the Pioneer Conference and played at a very high level,” said Harvard head coach Tim Murphy on his initial impressions of St. Thomas. “[They] were in virtually every single game, and they’re a big, strong, physical team. They’ve got a lot of typical or stereotypical big, strong offensive and defensive linemen.”
The series will benefit both teams. For the Tommies, playing the Crimson allows them to prove that they can compete with top FCS programs after they lost, 44-3, to their lone ranked opponent, No. 15 Northern Iowa, in 2021. It will give St. Thomas exposure to competition in the Ivy League, a defensive-oriented conference that saw three schools – Harvard, Princeton, and Dartmouth – enjoy national top-25 rankings for portions of last season.
“The opportunity of having both home and away contests with the Crimson allows us to highlight two programs that take both education and football very seriously at the FCS level,” said Caruso in a story posted to the St. Thomas Athletic Department’s website.
The series also marks a drastic shift for Harvard. In Murphy’s 27-year stint at the helm of the Crimson, which has seen him become the winningest coach in conference history, he has never coached a game in the Midwest. In fact, when the Crimson travels to St. Paul in 2029, it will be the first time it has played in the region since a 14-12 loss to Michigan on Nov. 9, 1929. Murphy is hopeful that through the series, the Crimson will be able to strengthen its recruiting efforts in the Midwest after it rostered just one Minnesotan, junior linebacker Matt Cavanagh, in 2021.
“Just the opportunity to give us some more national-type games,” said Murphy when asked what he was most looking forward to about the series. “Now we’ve played on the West Coast, we’ve played in the Midwest, and we’ve certainly played most of our games on the East Coast, just to give our players, fans, alumni, the opportunity to become a little more national.”
The game will serve as the season opener for Harvard in both 2023 and 2029, with the Ivy League’s conference schedule slated for the latter half of the season. All time, the Crimson is 120-25-2 in its season openers, including 19-8 under Murphy. Meanwhile, since the Pioneer League starts play earlier in the year, the Tommies will be playing their third game of the campaign. As part of the comprehensive 10-year deal struck by ESPN and the Ivy League in 2018, the 2023 contest will be broadcast on ESPN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 13 Crimson stayed hot in Ivy League play as it extended its win streak to five after securing two victories in Cambridge this weekend. After a tough-fought 5-2 victory over No. 39 Princeton and a dominant 5-0 victory over No. 42 Penn, Harvard remains a perfect 5-0 in Ivy League play and 6-0 at home this season.
“We’re feeling good,” said junior Steven Sun. “They were two really good teams. We're feeling like we’re in a good spot to secure the [Ivy League] title right now.”
The Crimson (15-4, 5-0 Ivy League) returned home after a road trip to face Columbia (12-6, 2-1) and Cornell (16-6, 3-1) in New York last weekend. Harvard handed both teams their first conference losses of the season.
“Beating Columbia and Cornell was huge,” said Sun. “Columbia has been one of our biggest rivals for the past few years, so beating them especially after a few years without Ivy play was big. Cornell is a great team too, so [the weekend] was really big for our standing in Ivy play.”
The Crimson had a strong start to their Saturday match against Princeton (17-7, 3-2) as it won the first point of the match in doubles play. The second-seeded doubles team of sophomore Ronan Jachuck and junior Harris Walker got Harvard’s first win of the day with a 6-3 victory, and sophomore Henry von der Schulenburg and Sun secured the first point for the Crimson with their 6-3 victory at the three seed.
Jachuck added Harvard’s first point in singles play with a 6-2, 6-3 victory at the four spot. Von der Schulenburg, the top-seed, grabbed another point for the Crimson with a 7-6 (2), 6-3 win. The Tigers managed to stop the bleeding, securing their first point of the day at the five spot in a 6-4, 6-4 victory over first-year Daniel Milavsky. Sun sealed the victory for Harvard with a well-fought 6-0, 3-6, 6-1 win in his sixth-seeded matchup. Princeton senior Karl Poling got the Tigers their second point of the match in a 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 win over senior Brian Shi. Walker tallied the final point for the Crimson in an exciting 6-1, 7-6 (12-10 tiebreaker) as the two-seed.
Less than 24 hours later, Harvard handled business in a decisive 5-0 fashion against a strong Penn (17-5, 4-1) squad. Heading into Sunday’s match, the Crimson and the Quakers were the only two teams in the Ivy League without a conference loss this season.
“The mindset heading into the match against Penn was to take care of business,” said Sun. “ It’s always hard to come off of a big win and get it done again, but I think we did a really good job of taking it one game at a time.”
Again at the three seed, von der Schulenburg and Sun started the action for Harvard with a 6-2 win over the Quakers. While the top-seeded team of Shi and Milavsky fell 4-6, Jachuck and Harris secured the doubles point for the Crimson with a close 6-4 win.
Singles play for Harvard was smooth sailing as von der Schulenberg, Walker, Jachuck, and Sun all won their matches in straight sets to seal the match for the Crimson.
With its victory over Penn, Harvard is left as the sole undefeated team in the Ivy League. Its recent win also marks a five-game win streak. The Crimson looks to tap into that momentum as they conclude regular season play in the coming week and prepare for the NCAA Regional Championships on May 6 through May 8.
“We’re really excited,” said Sun. “We have a great opportunity, if we win these next two, to end the season undefeated. We’re gonna keep taking it one match a time and keep taking care of business every day.”
Harvard wraps up regular season play this weekend against Brown (9-13, 0-5) in Providence, RI on Friday, April 22 and Yale (9-11, 1-4) back at home in Cambridge on Sunday, April 24.

With the return to campus, we’ve seen the return to our favorite Harvard lingo that we know and love (and hate). From “Berg” to “paff” to “basty” to “HUA,” not even Harvard students can keep up with the new vernacular, let alone the class of 2026. If you’re a pre-frosh or even just a Havard student who’s a little lost, look no further — we’re proud to present to you Flyby’s annual Harvard lingo breakdown: Class of 2026 edition.
The Yard
An abbreviation for the famous Harvard Yard. As a first-year, you’ll be randomly housed in one of the dorms facing the Yard, greeted with a beautiful view of the greenery and slightly less beautiful view of the tourists each morning.
The Houses
While first-year students reside in the Yard, upperclassmen at Harvard live out their next three years in one of the 12 Harvard Houses, each complete with their own dhall (see below), gym, library, and amenities such as art studios and gaming rooms.
The Quad
Home to three of the Harvard upperclassmen houses, the Quad boasts a beautiful lawn, cute dogs, and great eateries. Oh, and a fifteen minute walk to the Square, which Quadlings (Quad residents) will tell you really isn’t that far, no seriously, especially if you take the Shuttle or that shortcut.
The SEC
Short for the Science and Engineering Complex, the SEC is located across the Charles River and houses many computer science and engineering classes and labs. Though the distance can be daunting, Harvard provides shuttles to and from dorms to the SEC and there’s even a Trader Joe’s (<3) across the street to make up for the distance.
Berg
An abbreviation for Annenberg, the first-year-only dining hall. Imagine paying hundreds? thousands? hundreds of thousands? to have a building named after you, only for students to give it a heinous nickname. Oh well, we do it anyway.
Dhall
Short for dining hall, staffed by Harvard University Dining Services workers, some of the nicest folks you’ll meet on campus!
Quoffice
Located in Thayer basement, the Quoffice is Harvard’s official resource for queer students. The Quoffice strives “create a community where BGLTQ students can thrive and where all students are well-equipped to engage knowledgeably and compassionately with regard to gender and sexuality.”
Women’s Center
Located in Canaday basement, the Harvard College Women’s Center puts on awesome programming related to women and gender and is also home to very cozy couches, incredible staff, and a wide collection of teas for when you just want to relax!
Lamont
Harvard’s most famous 24/7 library. At any hour, you’ll find students cramming problem sets, writing essays, or enjoying a cup of coffee at Lamont Café.
Widener
Harvard’s most famous library, period. For those aspiring to the dark academia aesthetic, Widener’s got your back with beautiful art, marble floors, and people who will glare at you for checking your phone.
Cabot (AKA NOT CABOT HOUSE)
The 24/7 Cabot Science Library is located within the Science Center and is the home of late night group psetting (see below), not to be mistaken for Cabot House, one of the upperclassmen houses located in (see above) The Quad.
Entryway
15-30 students that are your main residential community your freshman year – typically either a portion or floor of a first year dorm. You’ll be getting oriented together and have frequent study breaks with lots of free food and your first year advising network (see below)!
PAF
Peer Advising Fellow. PAFs are upperclassmen who don’t live with you but offer great advice about classes, extracurriculars, and general Harvard life.
Proctor
Proctors, usually graduate students who live with you, lead your first-year entryway, hosting orientation events, study breaks throughout the year, and can continually serve as a great resource for all things Harvard.
Office hours / help room
A place to gawk at your hot TF A place to get help on your homework or get your questions answered by course staff
MQC
Math Question Center. Your social life if you take any math class. Typically a classroom with about 1 desk for every 3 people where you can ask all your questions about your pset (see below) due tomorrow.
Psets
Problem set. A series of questions assigned by STEM classes that will probably be significantly harder than any homework assignment from high school.
Section
Also known as “recitation” at other universities. Held for larger lecture classes, section is a smaller group setting led by a TF to review or expand on lecture material.
Section Kid
That one kid in high school who corrects the teacher when they’re talking? In college, we call them Section Kid. The respectful ones may have pretty strong triceps from raising their hand all the time. The less respectful ones won’t raise their hand at all. They’ll always say a lot without saying anything at all and they’ll have something to say about everything. Don’t be Section Kid.
ARC
The ARC or Academic Resource Center is Harvard’s peer tutoring center, offering one-on-one support in most big classes at Harvard, many of which you’ll take your first year. And if you do well in a class, you can get paid to work at the ARC as a tutor too!
Canvas
The app that ruins your day when you find out your midterm scores have been released. Canvas is a central platform (both a website and a mobile app) where your instructor will post course-related documents including assignments and syllabi and where you turn in your homework (and find out how well you did on it).
TF, CA, PSL
TF: Teaching fellow. Can be a grad student, sometimes a fellow undergrad, responsible for grading homework, hosting office hours, and teaching section bailing you out when you’re lost about what’s happening in class after you decided to skip every lecture that week.
CA: Like TFs, but they only grade your homework and host office hours. Make use of them.
PSL: Not your favorite Starbucks drink. Short for Peer Study Leaders, who are undergrads who previously took the course, did well, and now volunteer to spend their time answering your questions about the pset the night before it’s due.
Comp
The Harvard-way of saying you have to do some stuff (attending events, meeting members, and doing small projects or assignments) before you can officially join a club. A “completion” comp means you can join a club as long as you finish the comp! A “competitive” comp means that a club only takes a certain number of people and may make cuts during the comp process. Don’t worry, most comps are completion-based, and for the ones that aren’t, you can always try comping again if it doesn’t work out the first time!
When2meet
A futile attempt to coordinate students to schedule a 30 minute meeting that probably could have been an email
HUDS
Harvard University Dining Services. Pronounced “Hudds”. Harvard students secretly don’t mind HUDS but will pretend not to like it.
Tasty Basty
Abbreviation of “Tasty Burger Basement” Some may call it “lit,” some may call it “cursed”. Regardless, you’re guaranteed a good time if you’ve got an event there.
"Are you rolling Tasty Basty tonight?"
"Maybe."
"LAX is throwing tonight."
"Maybe not."
Flyby
Shameless self-promo: The people who wrote this article. Flyby is The Blog of The Crimson (Harvard’s student-run daily newspaper), which means we’re like Buzzfeed, but for Harvard. So make sure to check out the rest of our Visitas feature and other #relatable content! And if you want to join us in the fall, our comp (see: comp) is a chill, completion-based process!
The UC / HUA (?????)
Sorry for all you incoming class presidents hoping to continue your legacy at Harvard with starry eyes. Here’s the trainwreck that is Harvard’s student government: until a few months ago, we had the UC, a.k.a the Undergraduate Council, but people always complained that IT didn’t really do much. So this guy, Michael Cheng, ran for president on the campaign of “defunding the UC.” And what do you know, he won. So a few days ago he not only “defunded” the old student government, but annihilated it and started a new one — the HUA or Harvard Undergraduate Association. And then he resigned. Most people are either amused or enraged, but that’s where we’re at.
Consulting
The profession that roughly one in seven Harvard undergraduates end up in immediately after graduation. Basically, it involves working at one company that works for a bunch of other companies. In the process, you make a lot of money and travel a lot. No one knows what consulting is as a freshmen, but everyone eventually learns. When someone who has plans to change the world decides they want to do consulting instead, we call it selling out.
“Hey man, I wanna tell you something but you can’t judge.”
“What? Is everything okay?”
“Yeah.. I just realized…I wanna do consulting this summer.”
“But what about your big dreams of educating children?”
“...Nah I’m selling out”
“...”

To the lanyard wearing, (hopefully) not Jefes headed, class of 26-er:
Welcome to Visitas!
You did it — hoorah!
You made it into Massachusetts’s very own “small-liberal-arts-school-just-outside-Boston” school. your parents couldn't be prouder;your friends can’t stop posting you on their IG stories. And somehow your Tik Tok has finally blown up (spoiler alert: it definitely was your reaction video). You’ve been following people non-stop on IG, and have a draft of “Hey everyone! My name is….[insert name and hometown here]” in your Notes app for when you’re finally ready to make your debut on @Harvard2026. If you’re anything like I was, you’ve been cruising through second semester senior year since your decisions came out: aka showing up to first period 20 minutes late everyday with Starbucks in hand and no f*** left to give. Life is good and you “can’t wait for the next 4!” ;)
But as a seasoned second semester first-year whose transition to college put them through hella character development, I will tell you this NOW (and save you some money on plane tickets —more on this later): it is OKAY to be unsure of going to Harvard.
Not-so-surprising disclaimer: everyone and their mom (and maybe even your own) will tell you otherwise. Maybe not so directly, but with so many future “You can’t turn down Harvard!” and “You got into Harvard?!?!?” coming your way, the message is hard to miss: you just can’t get into the world’s best school and NOT go.
Spoiler alert: it's not. The legend is true: it is SO important to consider your options and choose the school that is truly best for YOU.
Harvard was my dream school. When I got in early, there was no way in HELL that I was going to a) give up my winter break to do a hundred other applications or 2) go crazy and give up a spot at MY DREAM SCHOOL?!?! So instead, I did the only sane, medically approved option: slept in till noon everyday, finally binge watched all eight Harry Potter movies, and went out for boba with my parents every night.
Do I regret it?
That's a difficult question to answer.
Overall — key word here — I've loved my time at Harvard. I have great friends, the best roommate I could ask for, advisors and proctors who have done more for me than their paychecks probably require of them, and I've found classes and clubs I'm truly passionate about. Though I’ll be on the first flight to Los Angeles post-finals, I have to admit: I’ll miss my first year.
But that doesn't mean it was easy. This is probably definitely oversharing, but in the spirit of complete and total honesty, I was ready to pack my bags two weeks into the fall semester. I was homesick, heartbroken, and depressed. What I had spent my entire life looking forward to — the dream I had dedicated nights and years and time and effort to — had let me down entirely.
There's a lot of reasons for this — the culture shock, leaving home for the first time, adjusting to college life — but for the sake of brevity, I’ll only focus on one: I hadn’t allowed myself to have options besides Harvard.
The minute I opened my acceptance letter and read the words “Congratulations!”, it had ended for me. All of the late nights and tears and sweat had finally paid off and transformed into a dream come true—how could I ever let it go?
I didn't allow myself to imagine a non-Harvard future. I didn't give a thought to any of the other schools that had accepted me. When I was unable to visit other schools, I comforted myself with the idea that visiting was pointless. Like everyone around me, I thought to myself, What's the point? It's not like you're going to go anywhere else. From the very first day, I convinced myself that to go down any path other than the Harvard path was not only impossible, but incredibly silly.
After succumbing to a crippling homesickness and visiting home after only two weeks of being in Cambridge, I realized that contrary to what the world around me said, I had been wrong. I should have considered and explored other schools. I should have visited the towns and campuses where I would commit to spending the next four years of my life. I should have given myself the chance to choose the school and future and life that was truly right for me, instead of just thrusting myself into a decision.
Do I blame myself for being unable to do so? No, for the same reason I could never blame any pre-frosh for doing the same. This may sound like the epitome of “first world problems,” but saying “No” to Harvard is hard. The world tells you you're crazy and ungrateful and that to do so would be not only foolish, but the biggest regret you’ll ever have. No instruction manual exists on how to tell your parents that you’re rejecting the dream you spent your entire life working for and that they sacrificed so much for.
But as I quickly realized after setting foot on campus last fall, maybe I should have. It's hard to say “No” to something a) you love b) have worked your entire life for and c) is objectively an amazing academic and professional opportunity. But if there's anything I learned last year, it's that the right choice is too, too often the most difficult one.
As someone who didn’t think they’d make it past September 2021, trust me when I say that things get better, they do. Have I loved my time and the relationships I’ve created at Harvard? Absolutely. Will I most likely (knock on wood here) continue to do so? I know I will. But do I know that I’d just be the taddest bit happier at UCLA or Stanford—somewhere not literally across the country from home? Yes. Can I say Harvard was without a doubt the absolute best choice for me? No.
We all make our own decisions and choose our own paths. I firmly believe that everything happens for a reason and that it all works out at the end. My path has brought me to Cambridge and it seems like I’ll be — happily, don’t worry — spending the next three years of my life here. But the best advice I can give any indecisive pre-frosh is to do what's right for YOU.
The world may tell you you’re crazy and your mom may cry and you may hate yourself when you look in the mirror for a while, but at the end of the day, who’s life is it? If you’re going to be stressed over adulthood and fighting for your life in chemistry courses, why be so in a place you hate? If you’re going to go through the character development that is college, at least get that character developed in a place like California, where the palm trees sway and the temperature never drops below 70 degrees. As I say to myself prior to making too many life decisions, you only live once—make sure to make the most of it.

Visitas is definitely one of the busiest and exciting events at Harvard. It’s a chance to meet the wonderful people you will potentially be spending the next four years with and an opportunity to get a glimpse of what life at Harvard is like. In hopes of providing some insight on things you might not want to forget during your stay on campus, we’re equipping you with a few things we wish we had or had done during our Visitas experiences.
Actually Analyzing the Campus
Yes, many people will tell you don’t judge a book by its cover, but it’s simply not true when it comes to college campuses. The weather, the atmosphere, and the vibes are all incredibly important in determining your happiness, especially because you will be attending classes, eating, and sleeping on campus for four years. While walking around the Yard make sure to note the layout of class and dorm buildings as well as the surrounding areas (i.e. Harvard Square) to figure out if the environment is right for you. Also, don’t forget to imagine these things walking through snow, ice, and freezing temperatures.
Actually Talking to People
We had a virtual Visitas, so that really influenced our somewhat shallow interactions with future classmates (cameras off, ALWAYS). Because your Visitas will be in person, make the most of your time here and reach out to people! Don’t feel pressure to meet your best-friend-for-life-til-death-do-you-part, but make an effort to talk to people at the club events you go to or even just getting to know someone better during a meal. And this applies to talking to upperclassmen as well! For the most part, all the upperclassmen you’ll meet, especially those moderating and holding club events, will be super happy to talk to you and give you frank advice.
Actually Asking Questions
Look, we get it. You don’t want to look stupid. You don’t want to ask a question in fear that everyone else will know the answer and you’ll receive some eye roll and a snide comment about pre-frosh.  We promise you, no one will really care if you ask a basic question (and if they do, they probably have bigger problems to worry about). You aren’t expected to know everything about Harvard, and the point of Vistas is to learn more about it! If you don’t ask any questions, whether it be about a club or to your host or even to faculty, then it will be harder to get a true sense of what Harvard is actually like.
Not Stressing Out About Extracurriculars
Clubs and extracurriculars will definitely be a huge part of your life at Harvard and are a  great segway to meeting new friends. You’re probably eager to search for organizations that suit your interests which is really great, but as you dive deeper and deeper into the sea of the many on-campus clubs, keep in mind that Visitas is not your only opportunity to get information. There will be another large club fair during your orientation period in the fall where you will be able to sign up for extracurriculars. So please, please, please don’t feel like Visitas is the end all be all in terms of finding your niche at Harvard. The point of the Visitas club fair is to give you a taste of what you will have access to for the rest of your undergrad experience. Take the time to explore your interests but don’t feel pressured to find all the clubs you want to be a part of during your short visit.
It’s true, Visitas can be overwhelming and stressful at times, but remember that college is not only about what you can bring to the school but also what the school can provide for you. So, have fun, be adventurous, and we hope to see you soon!
