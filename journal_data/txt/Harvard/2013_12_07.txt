After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team was slow out of the gates against Brown and, despite multiple chances to fight back, was never able to make up the lost ground.
Brown (4-6-1, 2-4-1 ECAC) rode two first period goals to victory on Friday night in Providence, defeating the Crimson, 2-1.
Harvard (4-7-1, 2-6-1) was able to tally a goal less than two minutes into the third period, as sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey put a shot past Brown goaltender Tyler Steel to cut the deficit to one.
The goal marked Vesey’s team-high eighth of the season and Hart’s team-leading seventh assist of the year.
But the Crimson was unable to register a goal on any of its other seven shots in the final frame to force the game into overtime.
Brown maintained high offensive pressure throughout the contest, out-shooting Harvard in every period and recording a total of 32 shots to the Crimson’s 18.
Freshman forward Kyle Kramer opened the scoring for Brown less than six minutes into the match-up. The rookie took a feed from junior defenseman Joey de Concilys and sophomore defenseman Bradon Pfeil and rocketed it into the back of the net. The goal was the first of Kramer’s career.
The Bears followed this up later in the period by capitalizing on its first power play opportunity of the game. After a Harvard freshman defenseman was called for roughing, Brown junior forward Matt Lorito and sophomore forward Mark Nacierio helped move the puck and set up senior defenseman Dennis Robertson, who was able to finish past senior goaltender Raphael Girard. With the assists, Naciero and Lorito lead the Bears in points with 14 and 12, respectively.
Despite allowing two goals, goaltender Girard managed to turn away 30 shots on the night.
Girard left the net with 1:12 remaining in the contest in favor of the extra man on attack, but the move was unsuccessful as Harvard was unable to score a goal before the buzzer sounded.
The Crimson had two man-advantages in the first frame on boarding and tripping calls, but the team was unable to tally a goal after these minor penalties. Harvard finished the game 0-for-3 on the power play.
The Crimson has struggled all year on the man-advantage, only managing to score once on the team’s 14 attempts. Harvard ranks second-to-last in the Ivy League in power play conversion, leading only Yale who has yet to score man-up all season.
With the loss, just one point separates the Crimson from the bottom of the ECAC rankings. Only Dartmouth and Princeton are below Harvard in the current standings.
Friday’s contest also marks the team’s second straight loss and seventh in its last nine games. The Crimson is 1-2 thus far on a four game road trip, which concludes Saturday at Yale.
Harvard has struggled in Providence in recent history. The team has lost three consecutive match-ups against the Bears in Meehan Auditorium, with its last win coming in Feb.2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a Boston University turnover led to a coast-to-coast layup for Harvard sophomore guard Siyani Chambers—giving the Crimson a double-digit lead with 6:20 remaining in the game—Saturday afternoon’s contest seemed to be in the bag.
When Crimson junior guard Wesley Saunders caught the ball on the left wing, took two dribbles, and lobbed a pass to a streaking Kyle Casey—who finished with an emphatic dunk—the game seemed to be all but over. Harvard had once again extended its lead with only 1:38 left to play.
And, when Chambers intercepted an errant Terrier pass on the subsequent possession and sped up the floor, it seemed that Harvard, too, was coasting.
But, as Chambers rolled his ankle on the ensuing lay-up attempt, it was not just the point guard who came crashing down, but the Crimson’s lead as well. In a span of 17 seconds, two consecutive Boston University three-pointers—including one bank-shot—brought the home team within one for the first time in over 12 minutes.
Thirteen seconds later, a split trip to the charity stripe from Harvard junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi instigated a chaotic fast break. Terrier sophomore guard Maurice Watson Jr. took the ball up the floor, splitting the Crimson defense and laying the ball into the hoop, tying the contest in the process.
A game that was in the bag, sealed, and all but over, was suddenly headed to overtime.
“[BU is] a team that has a great deal of confidence in late game situations,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think this year they were terrific [and] prepared…. You see that with experience.”
However, in the extra period, 11 straight Harvard free throws gave the Crimson a lead that, this time, it would not relinquish. And when the final buzzer sounded, Harvard came out on top, 79-68, at Case Stadium on Saturday afternoon.
“It was a big relief,” Chambers said. “[W]e thought we had it in regulation. Coming down the stretch, they made tough plays to get back into it and tie it up. The momentum was changing and [it was huge] for us to go out there and work as a team, get buckets, and get stops.”
A strong first period performance from Saunders, supplemented by efficient second halves from Chambers and senior Kyle Casey, led the Crimson to its fifth straight victory. The trio put up 51 of the squad’s 62 total field goal attempts, and shot 12 out of the team’s 16 free throws. Saunders finished with 25 points, five rebounds, and four assists, whereas Chambers and Casey tallied 19 and 16 points, respectively. On the boards, Casey corralled a game-high 12 rebounds.
On the day, the Crimson had one of its worst shooting outings of the season, hitting field goals at only a 41.9 percent clip.
“We didn’t finish as well as we would have liked,” Amaker said. “I want to think that there are some things we should have done that we were not doing—making the extra pass, finding the open man off of penetration, and not forcing [the shot]…I don’t think that we played as efficiently as we could offensively.”
While in the second half it was a battle between teams, in the first period it was largely a battle of coasts, as Los Angeles native Saunders went head-to-head with Philadelphia’s Watson. The two traded offensive tricks for most of the half, with one guard’s crossover being bested on a subsequent possession by the other guard’s spin-move.
After Terrier John Papale missed a jumper with 14:27 left in the opening period, Harvard co-captain Laurent Rivard fired a pass to teammate Saunders on the left wing. Saunders caught the ball and immediately changed directions, heading towards the paint. Three dribbles later, Saunders stopped on a dime, dribbled between his legs, and pulled up at the right elbow. Both his defender and the shot went down.
On the next play, Watson grabbed the ball on the right wing, took two dribbles, and nailed a jump shot. And on it went.
Watson finished the game with 14 points, eight assists, and four steals, shooting over 58 percent from the field.
“Their guards are very crafty,” Amaker said. “They do a very good job creating for others….Watson is good, he is very difficult. He is quick and can go either way. He is a terrific finisher and a guy who can make shots around the goal over bigger players.”
Watson was helped on the offensive end by senior forward Dom Morris, who notched 15 points and nine boards, while committing five turnovers.
One of the Crimson’s biggest scares of the night was the rolled ankle Chambers suffered towards the close of regulation. After remaining on the ground for nearly a minute, Chambers was able to return to action. Meanwhile, co-captain guard Brandyn Curry and junior forward Kenyatta Smith still remained sidelined with foot injuries.
However, about five game-minutes after Chambers rose from the floor, the focus on the team’s scares turned into a focus on the teams’ scores, as the Crimson had officially put away its Boston counterparts.
“I like big challenges and I know our team likes big challenges,” Chambers  said. “We are going to get everyone’s best shot and those are the games we want to play in. That’s how we prepare and that’s how Coach prepares us. It is fun to play against…a team like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two seasons ago, senior forward Kyle Casey was the Harvard men’s basketball team’s leading scorer, complementing his post game with the ability to step outside and knock down jumpers. After a year away from the team, Casey has struggled at times to recover that offensive identity, especially with the emergence of sophomore guard Siyani Chambers and junior guard Wesley Saunders as scoring threats. But during Saturday afternoon’s contest against Boston University, Casey put all the pieces together again.
In an intense battle of Boston-area foes, Casey was the Crimson’s most efficient player, scoring 19 points on 13 attempts from the field and grabbing 12 rebounds to help his team outlast the Terriers in overtime, 79-68. From a three-pointer at the top of the key to a powerful finish of a late-game alley-oop, the Medway, Mass., native had his full offensive arsenal on display.
“[Casey] was a big-time competitor for us this afternoon,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “If you look at his numbers and his work on the backboard, he certainly came out and was a rock for us.”
Though he struggled with foul trouble in the first several games of the season, Casey also turned in a solid defensive performance, committing only three fouls in 36 minutes of action and tallying ten defensive boards.
“Kyle is the back line, the voice of our defense, and we rely on him to give direction to our guards and rebound the ball,” Amaker said. “You look at his stat line, and certainly being a local kid, I know how meaningful the game is for him.”
Saturday’s victory must have been even sweeter for Casey given the rough treatment he received from the crowd. The BU student section seemed to single out Casey in particular, hurling taunts about his involvement in the Government 1310 scandal.
RAISING “THE ROOF”
The environment in Case Gymnasium rivaled any the Crimson has seen so far this year, with a capacity crowd coming out to watch the intra-city rivalry. The intensity reached a peak in the last minute of regulation, when a pair of threes by Terriers sophomore guard John Papale shaved a seven-point Harvard lead to one in the span of 23 seconds. The roof almost came off “The Roof” when a lay-up high off the glass from Terriers sophomore guard Maurice Watson Jr. tied the score at 66 to send the game into overtime.
But the Crimson responded calmly in the extra period, hitting the first bucket and then converting 11 of 12 free throw attempts to quiet the crowd and secure a hard-fought victory.
“In the overtime, we stayed together and cut down on the stupid mistakes that we made at the end of the game," Saunders said. “We stuck to the game plan and didn’t do anything beyond ourselves.”
Harvard also locked the Terriers down in the extra session, forcing three turnovers on three consecutive possessions to ice the game.
“I felt like, after John [Papale] hit the first shot after they scored in overtime, they turned up their defense, and we played a little timid,” Terriers forward Dom Morris said. “It was like we didn’t play with confidence.”
SOPHOMORE SHOWDOWN
The tight finish was reminiscent of last year’s matchup between Harvard and BU, which was decided by a game-winning floater from Chambers with four seconds remaining that put the Crimson ahead by the final margin of 65-64.
Though Chambers and Harvard prevailed once again, Watson got the better of the individual matchup between the two sophomore point guards. Watson consistently broke down the Crimson defense with his penetration and scored 14 points on seven-of-12 shooting, including the game-tying lay-in, to go with his game-high eight assists.
“It’s fun, real competitive,” Watson said. “Me and [Chambers] jawed at each other a little bit. He’s a good player, and I’m a good player, and I always look forward to playing against good guards.”
Though Chambers struggled from the field overall, hitting five of his 14 shot attempts, he did connect on three three-pointers and directed the Harvard offense for all 45 minutes, as well as sticking with Watson on the defensive end.
“You have to rely on your help behind you as an on-ball defender,” Amaker said. “Siyani had the bulk of the work today, but Watson is good; he is very difficult. He is quick and can go either way. He is a terrific finisher.”

The end of the semester is a stressful time, and we all need to remember to relax every now and then. Flyby is here to help! This is the third installment in our Seven Days of Reading Period series, inspired by "The Twelve Days of Christmas." Stay tuned for more!
 On the third day of reading period, Flyby gave to me three trailers of movies you can look forward to seeing after finals are over.
Anchorman 2: The Legend ContinuesRelease date: December 18The intensity with which you're pining for the end of the semester is equaled only by how much you're pining for the Anchorman sequel. Both are within reach.Saving Mr. BanksRelease date: December 13You have an idea for your final project, your final paper, or your final presentation. You have to work hard to make it happen. At least you don’t have to fight with Walt Disney about it.The Secret Life of Walter MittyRelease date: December 25It happens to all of us: you're studying or finishing a paper and for a minute (or 30), you zone out and imagine a glorious life free of finals. Walter Mitty can relate, except his imaginings are a little more exciting!
A deferral, in my opinion, is the most unsettling decision an early applicant can receive.  By the time early action decision day arrives, all students really want is a definitive answer—whether that was a yes or a no. Being deferred would just drag out the suspense for another three months.
If you are deferred, the college has essentially thrown your application back into the fire.  A deferred application will be reevaluated with the regular decision applications and receive a yes or no decision sometime later in the year.  The only good news is that there’s still hope.  It is by no means an entirely negative thing and you shouldn’t think that it is.
At this point, your primary concern should be what to do with the extra three months you’ve been given.  There are basically two approaches to choose from: to sit idly and wait, or not.
The first approach adopts a strategy of least resistance. Someone in this camp would tell you that the admissions office already has all the information they need to decide on your application, and to pester them with further information about yourself would just annoy them and decrease your likelihood of acceptance.
I acknowledge there might be a grain of truth behind this: bombarding the admissions office with mountains of information about yourself might actually do more harm than good in the end.
Advocates of the other approach, on the other hand, would say that waving your name and accomplishments in the face of your admissions officer can only give you more exposure and increase the likelihood of your acceptance. If you have extra time, it is probably best to take advantage of it.
I, however, believe the right answer lies somewhere in the middle.
If you have a meaningful accomplishment or experience before the regular application results are released, by all means, let the admissions office know.  The most important thing, though, is that these successes are meaningful.  You wouldn’t necessarily send out news about the A you got on your calculus test, and you probably wouldn’t need to report that your lacrosse team has a 4-1 win-loss ratio so far this season.  Think carefully.  If you catch yourself saying “I really wish this happened in September so I could’ve used it for my Harvard application,” then by all means let the admissions committee know about it.
The only other piece of advice I have for those deferred is to stop worrying about it.  If you let yourself think about it too much you’re just going to torture yourself.  The email will come one way or another, regardless of how much time you spend worrying about it.
And no matter what that email says, you’re going to be alright.
