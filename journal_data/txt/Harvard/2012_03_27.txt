After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations, theatergoers. You’ve scored an exclusive look at the making of the hottest television show in the country! Welcome to the world of “The Hunger Games,” based on the eponymous best-seller by Suzanne Collins, in which a post-apocalyptic nation plays host to a brutal teenage death match. With Gary Ross’ relentlessly fast-paced direction, Jennifer Lawrence’s subtle portrayal of rebel hunter Katniss Everdeen, and cinematography as overwhelming and urgent as the book itself, “The Hunger Games” proves to be that rare triumph: a compelling adaptation that captures the spirit and atmosphere of its source material without sacrificing originality or pandering to its audience.
In the land of Panem, the impoverished struggle to survive while the ruling citizens bask in a utopia of endless cosmetic alterations and decadent fashions. The film opens in District 12, a hopeless landscape of poverty-stricken Appalachian coal mines. Accompanied by James Newton Howard’s mournful bluegrass score, porches creak under the stunted bodies of the district’s skin-and-bones inhabitants. For Katniss, this is home—though not for long. In punishment for a rebellion 75 years prior, the ruling Capitol requires each of its 12 oppressed districts to annually furnish a male and female tribute to fight to the death in a massive televised spectacle whose slogan is a glib “May the odds be ever in your favor.” Fiercely protective Katniss enters this lethal gladiator contest to replace her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields), who is selected in the “Reaping.”
The entire film thus becomes an exercise in tension. Taut silence breaks with sonic ringing during the competition’s opening bloodbath. Jerky hand-held cameras add realism and a strong element of claustrophobic fear to the film. The unrelenting action veers from dread to heartbreak to all-out pandemonium, which Lawrence navigates perfectly. She is a deer in headlights as she is sucked through a tube into the arena; she is a horrified and disdainful outsider as she is paraded in front of thousands of blood-lusting Capitol citizens; and she aches convincingly as she is separated from everyone she holds dear.
Ross interprets Panem through re-imagining totalitarian icons. Third Reich symbolism abounds as the two tributes are selected from the bedraggled herd of District 12 teens. Replete with an ominous blood test and a propaganda film in the style of Leni Riefenstahl, the Reaping resembles a death camp. And the Capitol’s architecture stands as a bizarre melding between the Roman Coliseum and the enormous scale of dystopic Los Angeles in  “Blade Runner.”
Unlike the books, however, the burgeoning romance between Katniss and her fellow District 12 tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)—all played out while her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) watches—is underdeveloped and thus less devastating. In an already stuffed two-and-a-half hour adaptation, some things must inevitably fall by the wayside, yet a deeper exploration of Katniss’ ethical dilemma—to appeal to the show’s audience or maintain integrity?—would have been a powerful complement to the rebellion she inadvertently ignites across the nation. Yet Ross makes up for this shortcoming by fleshing out settings and events which occur ouside of Katniss’ limited perspective, such as the pristine technological game room where adults engineer children’s deaths, the political machinations of diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland), and violent riots that begin in the district of a tragically fallen tribute.
Film allows Collins’ masterful commentary on modern society to ring truer than in the book. “Are you excited? Let me hear it!” encourages the host of the spectacle, Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), to the audience’s rabid cheering. “This is the moment you never forget—when a tribute becomes a victor,” he narrates in a recap of previous Hunger Games as one teenager pummels another to death with a bloodied brick. If not for the perfectly-placed footage, he could easily be commenting on the finale of “Survivor.”
Narrative arc alone is not enough to drive this adaptation. Through its realistic character portrayals, the movie succeeds in the difficult feat of encapsulating its precursor with grace. Powerful directing and Lawrence’s perfect embodiment of Katniss ensure that the odds are ever in favor of “The Hunger Games.”

The most interesting part of William Kentridge’s first Charles Eliot Norton lecture last week concerned the effects of a solar eclipse. He described how to watch an eclipse take place without looking directly at it: If you cut a small hole in a piece of paper and hold that paper flat above a table or other flat surface, you can see the circular spot of sunlight gradually become overtaken by the shadowy reddish crescent of the eclipse.
Kentridge had a revelation when he discovered that each and every spot of sunlight in his studio, including the irregular patches that had filtered through leaves, had its own red crescent—for 65 patches of light, there were 65 differently contoured crescents. Of course, he knew that anyone in Johannesburg with a paper viewer would see the same effect. But the unexpected manifestation of this omnipresence in his studio set Kentridge on a flight of realization about the endless proliferation of views and angles and projections that each object we encounter implicitly offers to the world.
This point brought to mind the role of the cosmos—that is, the universe—in art. On the one hand, it seems absurd to ignore the fact that the earth is a tiny thing occupying a negligent part of something mind-bogglingly vast. On the other hand, trying to include some sense of the universe in artwork seems like a fool’s errand, even willfully blind to art’s essential task, which is to grapple with human experience. But to focus only on the latter, by far the historical preference, is to lose the opportunity for a real challenge of form and scale.
Say what you will about Damien Hirst’s simultaneous international showing of his assistant-manufactured spot paintings (some critics called it a facile prank), but that exhibit does address the universe, proposing a vast new world of identically random spots, one painting with many windows across the globe. In a similar category are the earthworks of artists like Robert Smithson, or Nancy Holt, his lesser-known collaborator, whose tunnels and tubes for viewing the sun or the scenery are right in line with Kentridge’s eclipse experience. Christo and Jeanne-Claude, of the giant environmental installations, modify the landscape by more ambitiously material means.
The extremely active French street artist JR brings an exciting synthesis of these ideas—all the more appealing because his pieces are up in major cities everywhere, and you can easily find them if you look. (He just completed a collection of pieces in Los Angeles for his “Wrinkles in the City” project, and he is responsible for the huge black-and-white photograph of squinting eyes that occupied the prime mural location on Houston at Bowery in New York City all of last summer.) Like Hirst’s spots, JR has found a style that he uses everywhere, making a single, global-scale artwork. He celebrates the texture and expression of the human face with huge black-and-white photography that he tightly pastes onto buildings, his images wrapping over drainpipes and sills like a projection.
His best work may be in the favelas of Brazil, where an entire neighborhood would become a dynamic, multi-layered canvas, with hundreds of photographs of eyes spanning across even more buildings. His work is about transformation on a huge scale, a kind of urban earthworks—but it also has a humanitarian mission, a desire to draw attention to neglected people and places, earning him praise and the prestigious TED prize in 2011. In its sense of community responsibility and activism, JR’s work represents the best of a certain kind of street art.
Kentridge’s eclipse-inspired revelation provides not only a lesson in perception and assumption, but also a further look into how art and everyday life are intertwined. Those little bits of light in the studio, each reflecting a distant solar event, are a powerful reminder of our relationship to the universe. Conversely, JR’s artwork starts at the large scale, entire cityscapes, and shrinks down to focus on individual human faces. Both make a case for expanding the context of art, its reach, and its display and demonstrate once again the heightened consciousness that comes from seeing art as the elemental structure of life.

In the months leading up to its release, Disney’s “John Carter” seemed to have a lot going for it.  The film’s director and critics’ darling Andrew Stanton was fresh off “Toy Story 3,” the latest in a long line of mostly Stanton-written Pixar hits. The source material, a sequence of stories written by early twentieth-century novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs, boasted an author also responsible for “Tarzan” and a long series of sequels providing ready-made material for an ongoing fantasy franchise. It looked like Disney had set the stage for another “Pirates of the Caribbean”-sized hit.
And “John Carter” is, for the most part, the film its source material and creative team promised it could be: a light-footed fantasy with Pixar charm and Tarzan cheese. And that’s enough to make it one of the most fun—and, if early receipts are any indication, likely one of the most under-appreciated—films of the year.
John Carter himself, in danger of suffering from faceless-hero syndrome at the hands of the relatively unknown Taylor Kitsch is at first as blandly heroic as he is generically handsome. However, “John Carter” comes to life when the protagonist travels from a cave in the Wild West to the plains of Mars, where he quickly discovers the superpower that makes him a hot commodity among the kingdoms of the red planet: jumping really, really high. The movie makes light of this talent—especially laughable because of over-powered superheroes made famous since the time of Burroughs’s novels—and so shows some good-spirited self-awareness.
But self-awareness should not be confused with self-parody. “John Carter” can be taken seriously to the extent that any playful sci-fi fantasy—think the mournfully romantic reunion of Princess Leia and the blinking, groping, newly unfrozen-from-carbonite Han Solo—can be taken seriously. It is a resolute, tight-lipped fantasy that only flirts with self-parody in asking us to treat a interplanetary war film as if it were a Vietnam documentary and a catalogue of mankind’s future calamities to boot.
“John Carter” has none of that severity and all the sense of going gleefully into the stars that books’ title “John Carter of Mars” would have suggested: the film’s strength is its joy in imagining another world with enormous, four-armed, double-tusked tribesmen called Tharks who make Carter an honorary species member just for being able to—you guessed it—jump really high.
Director Stanton reveals a deft touch in crafting a spirited sense of adventure. Shots linger on vast Martian landscapes, creating a sense of space and scope; a swelling score akin to “Lawrence of Arabia” teaches the audience to take the thing seriously but, for God’s sake, have some fun with it; Carter’s love-interest and Martian princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) is given a ceremonial wedding get-up so sexily scanty it makes slave-girl Leia look like a self-conscious, kinky prep-schooler. The movie plays to its strengths: Mars is cool, sweeping fantasy scores are cooler, and Collins is so outrageously hot she makes young Carrie Fisher look like old Carrie Fisher. Really.
That’s not to say everything in “John Carter,” unexpectedly fun as it is, is all hilarity. Some scenes feel like rehashes of tropes done better elsewhere. The white apes unleashed to dispose of Carter and Thoris provoke that sense of anticlimax every effects-driven epic since “Star Wars” has had to grapple with—What galactic beasts could scare us in this post-”Star Wars”-Rancor world?—and the war between the two great kingdoms of Mars never seems to matter much beyond the truly pressing question of whose bed Thoris will be gracing with her presence by picture’s end.
But that question, the question of star-crossed lovers separated by that romantic vacuum called outer space—the question driving everything from “The Empire Strikes Back” to “Thor”—is more than enough to carry the film. Near the end of the movie Carter turns to nephew ‘Ned’ Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) and advises the young aspiring author to shoot for the stars: “Fall in love. Write a book.” Or, we might say, watch a movie. It is a great credit to the joy of “John Carter” that at its best—franchise or no franchise—it can convince us that those three things aren’t so different after all.

Who knew the CIA had such an extensive real-estate portfolio? In “Safe House,” rookie CIA agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), armed with an Ivy-League pedigree, gets to baby-sit off-the-grid, international “safe houses,” where key witnesses and other agents can stay under protection. One day, bureaucrat David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) decides that Weston has had enough experience “staring at four walls all day” waiting for something to happen. Fortunately, with a combination of Reynold’s and Washington’s superb acting and an unconventional setting for an action flick, “Safe House” provides adrenaline of the type Weston would crave.
Agent Weston is played with focus and intensity by Reynolds—who redeems himself from the glowing green ashes of his 2011  “Green Lantern” fiasco. He runs a safe house nested in downtown Cape Town, South Africa, where he is bored beyond belief until rogue CIA operative Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington) arrives after a daring escape from mercenaries. Denzel Washington, who is best remembered for quiet, measured performances in movies like “Remember the Titans,” and “The Great Debaters,” plays a different type of quiet: dangerous. He commands the screen by deftly fashioning a character whose stoicism creates lasting suspense over whether or not his character is truly “rogue.”
Weston is forced to rise to the occasion as the mercenaries shoot their way into the super-secret, high-tech abode. Their too-easy entrance also provides the first clue that most likely no one is safe, no one can be trusted, and everyone—including Weston—has been targeted for elimination by a “mole” on the inside. Abandoning the safe house with Frost, the James Bond of CIA operatives, in tow Weston is on the run and equipped only with office skills. But, Weston believes if he can deliver Frost to his CIA bosses, he’ll get a promotion out of house-sitting and be able to follow his smoking hot girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) to Paris.
“Safe House” follow the mold of the modern, violent action flick. Bullets fly and cars crash, which performs an intense urban renewal upon Cape Town. The carnage that ensues is breathtaking, and the body count, blood, and gore accumulate rapidly as a large cadre of faceless bad guys joins the hunt. While these elements of the film provide only the bare minimum requirement for its genre, the semi-urban Cape Town setting  provides an unconventional setting for an American action film. Weston and Frost run through both shanties and modern office buildings, with plenty of open space for director Daneil Espinosa to choreograph well-shot violence.
For example, the gunfight among the boxy shanties of the slum is well-staged as Weston and Frost use the geometrically-convenient space for a dramatic shoot-out, using people’s homes as cover. Thus, the film avoids overdone city locations and clichéd, running-and-shooting gunfights.
Weston and Frost’s repartee also provides a tense atmosphere of witty and fresh dialogue. ”[When the CIA says] ‘You’ve done a fine job, Son. We’ll take it from here.’  That’s when you know you’re screwed,” Frost says to Weston, advising him to be wary of the platitudes of his CIA bosses.
Much of the plot follows a formulaic mash-up of “24,” “Die Hard,” and “True Lies”: the rookie learns from and bests the experienced mentor, the government agents are shady, and the bad guys somehow magically know where the heroes are going. However, in the same vein, the action flick formula can also provide the chance for a great villain to shine—such as “Die Hard” and the legendary Hans Gruber. The reveal of the ultimate villain in “Safe House,” the CIA that Weston and Frost serve, creates an unusual antagonist that prevents the film’s more cliched elements from overwhelming the new ones. This choice for a genre that loves a singular supervillain may not be safe, but it is ultimately sound.

“She does represent a new breed of artists and a new breed of working,” Pedro H. Alonzo, adjunct curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art, said about Caledonia D. Curry. Curry—better known as “Swoon”—is featured in a new installation, “Anthropocene Extinction,” on exhibit at the ICA until December 30. This work represents an unusual break from the street and performance art for which she has gained prominence in the contemporary art community.
Swoon began her career with an extensive background in drawing and portraiture at the Pratt Institute. While she always loved drawing, she struggled to find larger significance in it. “I [had] no idea how it interacts in the actual world,” Swoon says about her college days. Her classical training provided a foundation for her to explore other artistic outlets in the city.
Swoon was inspired by her surroundings in New York City. “I felt really attracted to the energy of the city…. I just wanted to connect with it in this, like, visceral, physical way,” she said. Swoon said that it was difficult to stay true to who she felt that she was in the city. It was at this point that she began to explore a new vehicle of artistic expression in street art, specifically, “ad jamming,” in which artists modify public advertisements as a form of expression and commentary. “[There is an] unspoken rule that your mind can be trafficked through but that you can’t speak back,” Swoon says in reference to the cause behind her collective. This rule bothered Swoon, so she acted against it.
One of her first projects was called “Toyshop,” a collective that modified hundreds of billboards that crowded the streets of Brooklyn. From there, she has gone on to participate in a number of public performance projects. These activities range from a relief project constructing reinforced adobe structures in post-disaster Haiti to the “Miss Rockaway Armada,” which consisted of a group of artists that constructed a raft from reclaimed materials and sailed it down the Mississippi while making stops and giving performances along the way.
“Anthropocene Extinction” seems to be a break from Swoon’s trend of direct involvement—an opportunity with both advantages and disadvantages. “The reason why street artists are street artists is because they want an unmediated relationship with the public,” says Alonzo. This relationship is compromised when the art is exhibited at a museum. “What you make on the street becomes associated with commoditization, so people will steal it and want to sell it,” Swoon says. “For me, always putting stuff outside was always about making it not an object and making it free to every person.” Swoon began to see more potential in having her art in a gallery. “I really understood it as not something that was a reduction of ‘This used to be on the street, now it’s stuck on a wall, and it seems less alive.’ It was more, ‘I get to go through another whole level of thinking, and I get to enact another whole thought process.’”
For Swoon, this different process involved engaging with her pieces more symbolically and less directly than the work with which she has been typically associated. “This is a piece that is really about the environment and the devastation of the environment,” Alonzo says about “Anthropocene Extinction.” He goes on to point out that this particular exhibit is a more symbolic commentary because Swoon is not interacting directly with nature. In one space is a temple with germinating creatures that spill through the mouth of a temple. These creatures are suspended above the audience between this temple and a large wall where the second component of the piece resides. Here, there is what Swoon descibes as a “hillock of demons” that are sucking the  other animals into their mouths.
Alonzo offers an interpretation of Swoon’s work by adding, “This demon really represents humanity’s need to devour, consume, and destroy.” But the installation is not entirely pessimistic. “On  top of the demons sits a depiction of…one of the oldest living Aborigines…to have lived in her traditional lifestyle as a nomad in the [Austrialian] outback, and possibly one of the last people on Earth who actually lived in a society [who] lived in communion with their environment,” says Alonzo. The title of the piece comes from what scientists are call the new geologic era, according to Alonzo.  “[For] the first time…humanity’s impact on the Earth is so vast that scientists are thinking, ‘Okay, well now we have to call this the Anthropocene,’” Alonzo said. “Our impact is just so huge.”
Swoon’s latest piece is neither street nor performance art, but still manages to relay a powerful message. Her artistic purpose and practice is one that is mobilizing the contemporary artistic community in a new direction and changes the game for artists who traditionally take a more passive approach to their artwork.

There’s something very odd about Solomon Kugel’s mind, and it’s not just that he thinks Anne Frank is hiding in his attic in present-day rural New York. He’s also paranoid that his aging mother is listening to him through the house’s vents, that another Holocaust is imminent, and that he must always prepare for the worst. Throughout “Hope: A Tragedy,” Kugel grows increasingly convinced that the Nazis are about to bang down his front door. What would any normal person do? He makes a list of necessities, stocks up on matzah and Zyrtec, and asks everyone he knows if they would be willing to hide him in their attic.
This kind of hyperactive paranoia persists throughout Shalom Auslander’s first novel. The premise of a resurrected Anne Frank is an interesting idea, and the various characters are odd enough to pique the reader’s interest. The novel falters at times, however, due to repetitive syntactical choices—incessant swearing, for one—and a few questionable decisions concerning punctuation that distract from the central action of the book. Yet the story does end up succeeding through the humorous and persistently abrasive voice that Auslander delivers through Kugel.
Auslander provides a unique perspective on the era of World War II from his disgruntled narrator’s experiences and interactions. “Hitler was the most unabashed, doe-eyed optimist of the last hundred years,” says Kugel’s equally dark-humored psychologist. “Have you ever heard of anything as outrageously hopeful as the Final Solution?” It’s a peculiar way to look at history, but this novel unearths a part of history that, in most peoples’ minds, has been resolved or exhausted years before. Kugel’s feelings about the Holocaust are obsessive and guilt-ridden. Yet his mother, who haunts the house like Anne Frank haunts the attic, won’t let him forget. “Ever since the war,” is her constant refrain, as she berates her son for a lifetime of perceived disappointments and wracks him with guilt over an experience of which he has no memory.
But Kugel’s mother, surprisingly, was never in the Holocaust. Like her son, she led a happy, privileged childhood in New York. Once this bizarre revelation comes to light,  a major premise of the novel—the pervasive cultural presence of Jewish  guilt—becomes yet another manifestation of exaggerated paranoia. So when Kugel’s mother points to a lampshade and says, “That was your grandmother,” Kugel’s endless frustration with her guilt-tripping antics is finally understandable. He never was disregarding her experience in a genocide, but rather was fed up with her constant stream of lies. Yet Kugel soon comes to connect with his Jewish heritage in heretofore unseen ways: “A Jew can’t throw Anne Frank out of his house,” he realizes with a mixture of horror and somber acceptance when he discovers the elderly escapee in—where else?—his attic.
Reading Auslander’s novel is like living in another literary dimension where the world is riddled with endless obscenities and even inanimate objects battle against the main character. At one point Kugel has a heated conversation about his gluten intolerance with the toilet he has just mercilessly used. Sarcastic and pessimistic descriptions abound in his life: “Kugel awoke early the next morning, turning his face from the harsh rays of intruding sunlight that stretched across the room like some goddamned thing that stretches across some other goddamned thing.” This is his world view: Everything opposes him, and even if it doesn’t, he convinces himself that it does. There’s a lot of farting, defecating, and even repeated references to Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, whom his mother reverently holds up as a paragon of manliness. This sarcastic approach to life and religion is not new to Auslander. In fact, his other published works—a memoir and a book of short stories—are equally peppered with offbeat and dark musing on what it is to be Jewish. This engaging and consistently blasphemous view of the world ends up becoming the book’s most compelling aspect. Even to put words into Anne Frank’s mouth, the girl whom everyone thought died a martyr in a death camp, verges on becoming sacrilegious—is it a tribute to her memory, or a mockery?
The only barrier to complete absorption into Kugel’s paranoid mind, however, is the unnecessary choice of eliminating all quotations marks from the text. Perhaps this is a choice made to lure the reader more completely into Kugel’s head, but it ends up distracting from the actual salient events of the book by confusing perspectives and ideas. Other authors, such as Cormac McCarthy, have successfully enhanced the dramatic depth of their novels through eliminating punctuation. Here, however, the multitude of voices makes this choice fall flat. The novel is not quite simplistic enough in structure to take on a minimalist approach to grammar. Despite its original plot, the writing style itself is not particularly striking and does not benefit at all from attempts at artistic embellishment.
Ultimately, the labored yet creative way that Auslander writes about the Jewish experience stays with the reader more than the characters or plot. It’s a depressing view of religion and culture, and Auslander’s Anne Frank sums up one peculiar view of Jewish history toward the end of the novel. “I have been the blessed beneficiary of sixty years of humanity’s guilt and remorse,” she says sarcastically to Kugel. He is paralyzed by his inability to relate to the genocide of his people—and this, more than anything else, may best hint at his disdainful and angry outlook on life. Though it happened decades ago, the atrocities of the Holocaust are very real to Kugel, and throughout the entire novel, he cannot be rid of his remorse and paranoia. This guilt—and the dichotomy Auslander establishes between Kugel’s imagination and real life—drives forward a novel that is relentlessly offensive and intriguing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For my spring break, I exchanged drunkenness for drizzle and returned to my hometown, that gloriously unprepared host of the 2012 Olympic Games, London. I spent much of the week catching up on the blockbuster art exhibits around the capital, as any self-respecting artsy would.
By far the most remarkable show I saw was a retrospective of Lucian Freud’s portraits at the National Portrait Gallery. Freud, who died just last year, was by far the most influential British painter of his lifetime, and as far as I know, no one has stepped up to fill the admittedly enormous shoes he has left behind. The exhibition charts his work chronologically, moving from the far more whimsical and stylized portraits of his first wife, Kitty Garman, to the remarkably luxuriant depictions of the obese social worker Sue Tilley, who famously came to be called “Big Sue.”
Toward the end of the exhibition comes the last of many self-portraits in the show, “Reflection (Self-portrait)” from 1985, which is featured on the banner and paraphernalia, as well as on buses and billboards all around London. It is an arresting work that depicts Freud’s distant gaze, naked shoulders, and chest in full face view. I spent a solid five minutes in front of it, which, in an art gallery, feels like a lifetime.
The exhibition guide claims that this work marks a departure from the “youthful arrogance” of earlier self-portraits and is instead a harsh, introspective look at an aging subject. I beg to differ. I think the extraordinary care that Freud lavished on this work—the precision with which he rendered every wrinkle of his furrowed brow, his fastidious use of light—shows a skill and attention that are noticeably absent from many of the other portraits, as if to showcase his mastery of both the form and his own likeness. Its almost excessive technical flourishes, compared to his earlier self-portraits, makes it a supreme display of arrogance. This is not to say that the other works are anything short of extraordinary. They just don’t have the special something that this self-portrait has in abundance—that something that makes you forget how many more rooms there are to go in the show, and makes you stand for what seems like hours in front of it.
Self-portraiture is a funny thing. You have to try to be objective about a subject you cannot possibly be disimpassioned about—your very own person. Freud grasped this when he said, “The way you paint yourself, you’ve got to try and paint yourself as another person.” But it is impossible to paint yourself as another person.
Facebook is a kind of digital canvas for self-portraiture, and who can claim that their Facebook pages are utterly unbiased self-portraits? If any of your friends make this claim, this is your cue to de-friend them instantly—it’s bollocks. No one is honest about what he or she looks like on Facebook, least of all artsy people so concerned with aesthetic representation. No one puts up pictures of himself or herself that are physically compromising. Sure, you might be making a silly face. Your hair might be out of place. You might be cowering from the camera. But you still look good. Or at least you think you look good enough to be seen by the world.
Artsy people love to affect a demeanor of nonchalance about their physical appearance. “Posing for pictures which you know will be visible to your 1,000 friends and then some is so lame,” their devil-may-care expressions and tussled hair seem to say. And yet, their photos are arguably as staged as anyone else’s, complete with all the enhancements that iPhoto and Instagram can muster. The phenomenon of “muploads” is the single most galling offender of staged self-depiction. These photos masquerade as candids—snapped and uploaded to Facebook without any forethought—and yet muploads are most likely to be staged. They are often “mirror pics,” quick snaps of one’s reflection in a bathroom mirror or some other horrendously contrived setting. And this is not strictly a female vice; men are also liable to upload a self-glorifying picture via Instagram.
This all brings me back to Freud. His self-portrait, which had such an effect on me, was as much of an exercise in self-effacement as a “mirror pic,” in which the subject is flexing for the camera. How could the exhibition guide claim that it was less arrogant than previous portraits?
Perhaps the very act of painting one’s own portrait is intrinsically an act of egotism. Freud was making the most of his medium to exhibit his extraordinary skill in rendering a likeness. Yes, he looks drawn and wrinkly in the portrait, but that’s not the point. The point is that it is a painting of such consummate skill that it cannot but glorify its maker.
I said earlier that Britain has yet to fill Freud’s shoes. I sincerely hope that in this age of digital depiction the art of painting portraits has not died with Freud. Self-glorification in a portrait as phenomenal as Freud’s is permissible, even admirable. In muploads, however, it’s revolting.

“What does a slave look like to you?” one character asks another in “A Walk Across the Sun.” “Appearances can be deceiving.” The central focus of Corban Addison’s debut novel is the covert and pervasive influence of human trafficking around the world; this hidden trade comes to light through an American lawyer’s exploration of the disturbing world of modern slavery. Addison’s novel is an admirable attempt to depict slavery in both developed and developing countries; across the novel, he explores sexual exploitation, forced labor, and drug dealing. By dint of his own life as a lawyer with a strong interest in international human rights, Addison’s experiences position him well to write this story. In the novel, he takes real-life reports of human trafficking, constructs a compelling narrative from these accounts, and infuses a troubling subject matter with victims that display human vitality and love. Yet for all these emotional components, his writing ultimately cannot overcome a trite plot and stereotypical character representations.
After a tsunami destroys a coastal town in India, sisters Ahalya and Sita are left to fend for themselves when their family perishes. Despite their best attempts to escape danger, they find themselves trapped and enslaved, and repeatedly witness the monetary exchanges that dictate their next affliction as they are passed between various slave owners. They are initially sold together as prostitutes to a brothel, but are later separated when Sita is sold as a drug mule to transport heroine from India to France. Across her harrowing journey, she witnesses various incarnations of human slavery, like the prostitution of Eastern European women and forced labor at an Indian restaurant in Paris. The novel alternates between this narrative and that of Thomas Clarke, a Washington, D.C.-based corporate attorney who is struggling to come to terms with his failing marriage and professional dissatisfaction.
Addison’s prose style often leaves much to be desired. His writing tends to be clichéd, like his depictions of the emotional trauma of a failing marriage, the death of loved ones, rape, and enslavement. As he tries to resurrect his marriage, Thomas’s moment of epiphany emerges in rather trite prose: “Thomas felt as if he had been cleaved in two. He was still in love with her, he realized. He had never stopped loving her. Even when their child had died. Even when her eyes had become cruel and her tongue had cut him. He would marry her all over again. She was the best thing in his life.” More troubling is the way in which this linguistic simplicity impinges upon the characters’ psychological depth: harnessed to such conventional language, the characters are denied the complexities of full consciousness.
In addition, the majority of people that populate the novel are often purely stock. Though these characters are believable and sympathetic, this connection is largely because of cultural access to their stereotypical depictions. Thomas, for example, is a well-meaning, socially-concerned lawyer. He feels trapped in a commercial law firm ever since his father, a distinguished judge, pushed him along a career path he never desired for himself. He marries an affluent Indian girl from Mumbai, but her father resents Thomas’s cultural insensitivity, which paves the way for discussions of cultural conflicts throughout the novel.
The idea of “serendipity” also recurs throughout the novel, but in many cases the coincidental events seem overly artificial and undermine the realism of experience. All too often, the novel’s dialogue and plot resemble a Hollywood thriller, with witty but insubstantial conversational exchanges between its characters. Thomas meets his wife Priya in Cambridge, but she returns to her home in Mumbai after their marriage—strained by the death of their daughter and Thomas’s demanding job—disintegrates acrimoniously. Thomas is forced to take a sabbatical from his law firm and decides to work for the legal non-profit CASE (The Coalition Against Sexual Exploitation), which deals with trafficking and sexual violence issues in the developing world. The only available position is, of course, in Mumbai, and Thomas moves there. He initially lives with his roommate from Yale, who fortuitously enough also works in Mumbai. The parallel narratives only intersect when CASE arrives at Ahalya’s and Sita’s brothel—also conveniently in Mumbai—at the same hour that Sita is sold as a drug mule. If that coincidental chain of events was not sufficient, Thomas finally tracks Sita down in Paris at the very minute that she is being driven to an airport, bound for New York. The scene plays out as a cinematic trope: as Thomas arrives outside the house, the car leaves the driveway. Thomas recognizes the face of Sita’s captors, and chases after the black car as it turns the corner. At the same time, Sita looks out of the darkened car window and sees an unknown man running after them.
However, despite its stylistic deficiencies, “A Walk Across the Sun” is engaging and narratively well paced. The novel’s final result is commendable and successful: in relating the shady world of human trafficking and slavery, Addison shows how quickly life can descend from the commonplace into complete helplessness and hopelessness. Addison’s exposure of the world of modern slavery seems, however, unnecessarily didactic, for while he attempts to show the variations of human trafficking, his simplistic narrative and literary construct divest the novel of complexity. Though he initially claims that there is more than meets the eye in the stories of modern slaves, the novel crafts a world where individuals are instantly recognizable and do not develop psychologically. There is no moral ambiguity, and the narrative ends on a note of complete resolution. While satisfying, the dénouement deprives the story of the realism of human slavery, a complex social phenomenon, and as a result, the novel ultimately fails in its attempt to create believable narrative from authentic accounts.

“If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker,” Albert Einstein famously lamented after his own contributions to physics led indirectly to the creation of the atomic bomb. Einstein was not alone in seeing watchmaking as an innocuous, peaceful profession; Joshua Joseph Spork, the protagonist of Nick Harkaway’s latest novel  “Angelmaker,” goes into watchmaking, his grandfather’s profession, in part out of a desire for the quiet life and a desire to escape the legacy of his father, Mathew “Tommy Gun” Spork, a notorious London gangster. Yet, as he discovers to his immense chagrin, a humble watchmaker can find himself in a web of chaos that even Einstein could scarcely have conceived.
Nick Harkaway’s new novel is a striking hybrid of Victorian swashbuckler and the post-modern absurd. Its combination of exuberant and ridiculous characters and situations, with old-fashioned adventure and a preoccupation with machinery, calls to mind writers as disparate as H. Rider Haggard, the master of the implausible Victorian adventure, and Salman Rushdie, whose frenetic recent works span continents and centuries within a single novel.  It is consistently engaging, occasionally thrilling, and often amusing. But it is also prone to the pitfall that is common to both Victorian and post-modern fiction: excess. The action and characters that burst from the pages are usually an asset to Harkaway’s storytelling; only occasionally does their farce threaten to distract from the main action at hand.
The novel traverses multiple continents and continually switches back and forth between the 1940s—when Mathew Spork was in his prime—and the present day. That is not to say that it is disorganized: there is plenty of well-crafted plotting in this 500 page tome. At the beginning of the novel, Joshua Spork’s simple life of watchmaking is upended when, having taken on the assignment of fixing a vintage clockwork book, he inadvertently repairs an early Cold War weapon of mass destruction. Soon he is thrust into the paths of many shady individuals who desperately desire this device.
The scenario of an unsuspecting innocent at the mercy of dark international forces is familiar, but Harkaway manages to make it work through a narrative that reflects the work of Victorian writers like Charles Dickens. First, his array of characters, though mostly mere plot devices rather than genuine developed humans, is dizzyingly colorful. From the civil servants with the whimsically Dickensian names Mr. Titwhistle and Mr. Cummerbund—“Those are our actual names, I’m afraid,” says Titwhistle by means of introduction—who first arouse Joshua’s suspicion that something is amiss in his world, to the outrageous Asian drug lords Opium Khan and Shem Shem Tsien—“A man who likes, after taking his pleasure, to sleep with his hand upon his conquests”—the characters arrive in a series of vivid caricatures. This method allows the novel to maintain the rambunctious and exciting spirit of a Victorian caper.
Harkaway’s prose is tautly ironic, as befits a novel that takes place almost wholly in the realm of the absurd. Many of these outlandish observations are genuinely funny and ridiculous, such as the comment “The great treat of robbing a bank…is looking in the safety deposit boxes and seeing who had what squirreled away, then arguing over whether to hang it on or sell it on, and very occasionally uncovering something truly special or bizarre.” His habit of alternately referring “Joe Spork” or “Joshua Joseph” for comic effect is highly effective. Harkaway’s instincts let him down badly, however, with the character that is essentially the female lead—Edie Banister, a nonagenarian superspy. Frequently described as a “girl” and just as eccentric as the other characters—at one point wearing a false moustache “which tastes of tiger flank and erotic dancer”—Edie is clearly supposed to be the most absurd character of all, but her characterization is more tastelessly misogynistic than anything else. She employs the needless self-deprecation of being an “old cow” repeatedly, and this description is jarring in a book that is otherwise so enjoyably frivolous.
Like Joshua Joseph Spork, Nick Harkaway has himself acutely felt the need to distinguish himself from a famous father, the spy novelist John le Carré—both Harkaway and le Carré are pseudonyms—the author of “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy”. When Harkaway’s first novel, 2008’s “The Gone-Away World,” appeared in Britain, Harkaway emphasized how unlike his father’s work it was. “It’s an adventure without the faintest attempt at realism. It’s a love story. It’s a serious novel. And it has ninjas in it,” he said in his article in the British newspaper The Telegraph. Ninjas aside, this refreshingly clear-eyed piece of self-evaluation applies just as accurately to his second novel: “Angelmaker” has no more pretensions to realism than its predecessor. This style emancipates the novel from an expected need to reflect upon its various physical and temporal settings. Yet the novel is grounded in the sense that a story of such zany, freewheeling diversity could only be set in a city such as London or New York—global cities that effortlessly combine history and the present, and in which almost any manner of eccentric character or outrageous scheme is plausible.
Thoroughly unlike his father, Nick Harkaway is best understood as the literary equivalent of his fellow Londoner Guy Ritchie, the film director. Like Ritchie, Harkaway is keenly attuned to the surreal potential of London’s underbelly—and as with Ritchie’s films, “Angelmaker” is a wild ride through that underbelly in which every scene and character is memorable. “It is the magic heart of the city,” Harkaway writes of the Night Market, Matthew Spork’s criminal hub, “the greatest and most magical on Earth.” These compelling descriptions, equal parts fantasy and reality, create a novel singularly raucous and commanding in ambition.

“We aim to articulate ideas for which there are no words.” So wrote Office for the Arts Dance Director Jill Johnson in the program notes of this year’s Harvard Dance Program Spring Performances, a presentation of three original works at Farkas Hall on Friday.
Undoubtedly, the programming—which included choreography by Johnson and OFA Artist-in-Residence Christopher Roman—was conceptually ambitious. At its core, the repertoire was an effort to examine choreographic design. But at times, the effort to manipulate space and sound felt overdone, emphasizing provocative ideas rather than showcasing the movement that truly makes dance emotionally and aesthetically engaging.
“The Sum of Missing Parts,” choreographed by Roman in collaboration with his cast, was innovative in its use of space. Incorporating a pedestrian feel reminiscent of Jerome Robbins’ 1983 “Glass Pieces,” Roman arranged his dancers in single file lines that ebbed and flowed across the stage in intricate patterns. But the emotional weight of Roman’s choreography was lost in stretches of silence and overstated in passages of spoken words. Anxieties of self-worth professed in exclamations of “It’s my life!” and “Is this it?” could have been crafted more sensitively into the movement itself.
Roman and Johnson’s “Third Rail” investigated ideas not of space but of sound in choreographic design. While the audience listened to a steady electronic beat, the dancers performed to soundtracks of their own—many donning headphones plugged into a music player. Throughout the piece, the dancers removed their headphones and pressed them against microphone stands to reveal their songs. Though the idea was novel, it came at a cost: a great deal of distracted fidgeting onstage.
Johnson writes later in her program that the Harvard Dance Department aimed “to design motion and organize space in ways that resonate in at least one individualized moment with each member of the audience.” And indeed, moments certainly caught the attention. In “The Sum of Missing Parts,” Melanie J. Comeau ’13, Shayna Skal ’13, and Boston University student Samantha Stockman graced the stage with a seamless dance for three. Later, Halimeda Glickman-Hoch ’12 and Irineo Cabreros ’13 performed a touching duet with fluid weight transfers and intricate floorwork, while Tsung-Yun Tzeng, a Harvard Extension School student, opened “Third Rail” with shoulder oscillations that blended a balletic grace with the power of krump.
If “The Sum of Missing Parts” was an exploration of space and “Third Rail” of sound, the evening’s final work was a union of these choreographic ideas: a piece that aimed to “measure” the music using the stage as ruler. “The Sound of Distance in Itself”—a choreographic collaboration by Jill Johnson and Harvard students enrolled in Music 103r: Dance Masterwork Class: Forsythe—was inspired by the choreographic process of William Forsythe. As a revolving spotlight traced one beam of light across the theater, Johnson’s piece began with the emergence of an eerie buzz that evoked the sound of an approaching plague of locusts. Only when the sound reached a fevered pitch did the lights brighten to reveal that the dancers were producing the cacophony, each flinging a tangle of metallic yellow measuring tapes.
As the thunderous, cascading first notes of Gavin Bryars’ “String Quartet No. 1” began, Johnson’s choice to clad her dancers in black rain gear and goggles became clear: they were preparing to weather a storm of sound. With a sharp pulse of music, one dancer would lunge forward while another stepped back; with a distinctive bow stroke, a dancer would run across the stage as if to chase the length of the instrument’s sound. The flurry of movement—each motion unfolding beautifully in a spiral around the body’s vertical axis—wholly embodied Forsythe’s style.
As Johnson’s dancers flung their tangles of measuring tape a final time, the lights dimmed until only the flurry of glinting metal was visible against the black—an intriguing depiction of “sound” in the space where Johnson’s dancers stood. It was this finishing touch that revealed most clearly the aim of Spring Dance Performances 2012: to deconstruct the use of sound and space for both student dancers and their audiences. The Harvard Dance Program’s effort to pursue provocative choreographic design is laudable, though the balance between novelty and the quality of movement was not fully reconciled. Nonetheless, the challenge is a worthy one, for the most breathtaking moments in a performance happen when dance steps cease to be classroom exercises and become–as Johnson notes in the program—“ideas for which there are no words.”

Some months after the release of “The Joshua Tree” in 1987, U2 received a cassette from its label, Island Records. On it was a gospel recording made in a small brick church on West 124th Street in Harlem of “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For,” the second song off that album. When the band made its pilgrimage to America—captured on its 1988 album “Rattle and Hum,” along with its eponymous  documentary—band members stopped by the church to play the song. And if U2’s gospel sound was first introduced in “Still Haven’t,” it ran so deep that the gospel choir didn’t need to do much searching to find religion in the song’s three chords.
When the group began writing the song, it was an unremarkable reggae number called “Under the Weather Girls.” The bass-and-drum groove sits at the back of the pocket, pushing confidently forward with the rolling pace of a long-wandering caravan, gleefully propelled by the eighth notes on the bass drum at the end of every phrase. As the group struggled to finish the song one day in practice, the Edge handed Bono a small slip of paper on which he’d written, “Still haven’t found what I’m looking for.” Bono read the sheet and sang the chorus as it is on the record.
The lyrics crystallize that simple idea of searching. Bono answers the album opener’s wide-eyed first line, “I want to run,” with the more pensive “I have run,” recounting his character’s endless search. Yet his pilgrim is neither worn nor weary—to him, the searching is an act of steady, joyous faith. At the end of each chorus, when Bono sings the titular line, his voice unfurls on that first high note, folding down again in calm faith on “What I’m looking for,” while the group settles back to a steady pulse.
Each verse begins with a bold assertion—“I believe in the Kingdom Come”—always conveying the same idea of confident searching. This repetition is one of the most deeply religious aspects of the song. Its spare lyrics settle with the simplicity of a religious hymn over the rhythm section’s comfortable pocket, but the Edge’s lead-guitar line perhaps best conveys its religious tone. He anchors the song with the same clear, open interval. Behind the recurring line, he laces droning root notes. When the group plays the song live, it frequently begins with a long introduction of that same pure, unadorned ringing, repeating continously like a religious chant. The chant is essential to religious music both because it allows for communal singing and because it serves as a musical route to transcendence. In the repetition of a phrase, its meaning and duration disappear, allowing the performer and listener to rise above their immediate reality. Between those echoing, repeated notes, time collapses as the song becomes a limitless wash of feeling and faith.
While writing the 1984 album “The Unforgettable Fire,” Bono became fixated on the line from Jewish poet Paul Celan’s “Meridian” speech, “Poetry is a sort of homecoming.” This prompted him to write “A Sort of Homecoming,” but that same sentiment is evident throughout U2’s most religious music. “You don’t become an ‘artist’ unless you’ve got something missing somewhere,” Bono once said. “Blaise Pascal called it a God-shaped hole.” In this equation, music and religion form the otherwise absent parts whose discovery make someone whole. A home is a place where everything can be understood, a place made by people so they can know and love each other. Coming home, then, is a joyful experience, and it is this sort of conflated physical and spiritual fulfillment that “Still Haven’t” describes—a yearning for a place that will make the searcher whole and for the love he’ll find there.
Yet in the song, it’s not clear if such a place can be reached. If Bono’s character runs, crawls, and climbs but still can’t find what he’s looking for, then it is miraculous that the song seems so free from doubt. The unfulfilled journey and quest are so central to U2’s joy because they are at the core of faith: a journey from the known into hopeful unknowables. In the search, all possibilities remain—those of returning, of starting anew, of changing one’s self or one’s world.
The simple act of looking for something means that it is real, if not yet tangible to the searcher. Optimism, hope, persistence, and joy are the motives of an endless searching that can become itself a fulfillment and arrival. So it is that a chorus of “I still haven’t found what I’m looking for,” can be raised with such hope, such a joy of searching. Even if there is no end to this journey, only within the search do all outcomes remain—blessed by eternal angels, made real through faith.

Rappers Stasia Irons and Catherine Harris-White come straight from the Seattle rap scene, but judging by their latest album, it wouldn’t be surprising if they had roots in outer space. Irons and Harris-White make up the rap duo THEESatisfaction, and their first official album, “awE naturalE,” blends space-age tones and extensive use of synthesizer with cooing, fluid vocals to create 12 tracks that sound at once comforting and alien. Irons and Harris-White define their music as being “funk-psychedelic feminista sci-fi epics.” However uncanny that may sound, they succeed effortlessly in the genre that they themselves have coined.
The group’s older projects, including work with Seattle-based rap collective “Shabazz Palaces,” show the group’s ambitious trajectory, which leads into the rich atmosphere where “awE naturalE” floats—buoyant with passionate croons, smooth grooves, and richly intelligent lyrics. At points in the album, the work becomes too dedicated to being spacey and mystical and wanders away from its true treasure—Harris-White’s and Irons’ uncanny knack for funny, moving lyrics that deal with everyday moments of both frustration and beauty. The two rappers assert this skillful lyricism early on, and “awE naturalE” is enthralling as a result.
The album opens with a short track marked by heavy use of synth and beeping tones. The deep, low repetition of a single word, “yeah,” in pulsing, wave-like crests of sound, leads beautifully into the second track, “Bitch,” which is one of the best on the album.  Here, Irons and Harris-White are at their sharpest, playing off one another’s vocals over a bed of deceptively simple drumbeats. The lyrics are sharp and stylish as they tell a concise story, “Five bitches sitting next to the rug / They were flying on that carpet, and they needed some love.” The song breaks with a delicious exclamation, “Oh! I am the bitch on the side,” as each word is suspended in its own breathy bubble. The song is infectious but not sugary.
“QueenS,” the first single on the album, and potentially a stand alone in the rap genre for including the word “cardigan,” is a brilliant, rippling track that begins with a line that can be read as THEESatisfaction’s mission statement: “Leave your face at the door, turn off your swag...Don’t funk with my groove, whatever you do.” After the electronic tones of “QueenS” melt the listener down into a puddle of dance, the album takes a turn for the darker, with muddy, pensive tracks like “Existinct,” and “God,” which introduces a throaty horn accompaniment to the duo’s standard synth production.
However, several songs toward the end of the album are weakened by heavy-handed use of esoteric imagery. The song “Enchantruss,” much like its name, reaches slightly too far into the abstract with lines like, “Twirling towards destiny...An adventure to explore, perhaps a way to soar.” These lyrics fall flat in comparison to earlier biting, funny lines like, “When you look at the surface the world is flat / Flatter than your ass.”
However, the few songs in which Harris-White and Irons delve too far into their “empresses of time” personas, one of the duo’s many monikers, do not present any real threat to the quality of the album as a whole. The lyrics, which are passionate and sharply intelligent for the better part of the album, are complimented surprisingly well by the cool, futuristic tones of synthesizer and understated drums. THEESatisfaction is charting a course for outer-space, and its members have the raw talent and drive to pull listeners, as well as other artists, up with them.

Perhaps more than any other space at Harvard, the Barker Center’s Thompson Room epitomizes Old Harvard. Wood-panelled walls, leather chairs, and a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt contribute to the room’s aristocratic air. Because of this atmosphere, it was quite strange to hear the throbbing bass and pornographic lyrics of Prince’s 1980 song “Dirty Mind” echo through the room last Tuesday. Songs like “Dirty Mind” blared throughout the week, as cultural critic Touré delivered three talks on Prince as part of the Alain LeRoy Locke Lectures series. These lectures are centered around African-American culture and history, and as Touré argued, Prince is a massively important figure in these fields, although he hasn’t received as much scholarly attention as other contemporary stars like Michael Jackson. Touré delved into how Prince’s background and influences shaped his distinctive image and how his persona captured the imagination of Generation X.
Touré, a celebrated public intellectual who writes on topics from hip-hop to the concept of “post-blackness,” might be considered the critical equivalent of the musically prodigious Prince. In addition to music journalism, Touré has written novels and short stories, worked as CNN’s pop culture correspondent, contributed to MSNBC’s “The Dylan Ratigan Show,” and served on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominating Committee.
Touré’s skills as a journalist were shown through the various interviews he weaved into his lectures. His interview subjects included band members, Prince’s ex-manager Alan Leeds, and Prince himself. Through these diverse voices, Touré painted a vivid depiction of the artist’s past which allowed the audience to understand the genesis of Prince’s identity.
Touré argued, for instance, that Prince’s religious upbringing, which included services at Seventh-day Adventist churches, informed his use of gospel sound. He referenced the distinct-if-subtle influence in songs like “Let’s Go Crazy,” which includes a quasi-sermon at the beginning, and “Do Me, Baby,” which seizes on the call-and-response vocals and euphoric climaxes that are typical of gospel music.
Based on his notoriously lewd lyrics, Prince seems like an extremely unlikely Christian rocker. However, Touré argued that Prince’s frank sexuality on songs like “Do Me, Baby” were used to make his frequent religious references more palatable. “It was like hiding vitamins in chocolate cake,” Touré said, citing Prince’s apocalyptic overtones in the song “1999” or self-deification on “I Would Die 4 U.”  The most memorable use of lyrical evidence, however, came when Touré passionately recited the numerous times Prince has referenced the number seven, an important number in the Bible and Seventh-day Adventism.
In the second lecture, Touré examined the implications of Prince’s culturally diverse music. For Touré, Prince’s varied sound is key to understanding his multifaceted persona. “It’s interesting that he is pulling from multiple sources, and that allows him to sort of slide between multiple areas.  He sort of seems to be black and white and also seems to be male and female,” Touré said in an interview after the lecture. “That’s a huge part of his success.”
Touré, a Gen X-er himself, used his knowledge of societal trends to argue that Prince successfully captured the fears and desires of Generation X. At the beginning of the lecture, Touré gave a brief history of the VCR, noting how its popularity allowed pornography to enter American homes and thus become mainstreamed, triggering an abundance of sexual imagery in pop culture. According to him, Prince epitomized and fueled this trend. Significantly, American teenagers were also having more sex than ever before, even as the spread of AIDS made sex a frightening proposition.Through his music, Prince appealed to both sexually active teenagers and abstinent ones, as his explicit lyrics allowed listeners to experience sex vicariously.
Though such social details were prevalent in the three lectures, Touré focused most on the music itself. To convince the audience that gospel influences were prevalent in Prince’s music, he played Prince’s “Do Me, Baby;” as the song drifted through the room of scholars and Prince enthusiasts, Touré gently swayed and quietly grooved to the song’s beat. With its blatant erotic content, the song seemed out of place in the Harvard Faculty Club, where the final lectures took place, but it was clear that the song, as well as Touré’s movements, were necessary to help prove Prince’s spirituality. Once the call-and-response vocals, a hallmark of gospel music, could be heard in the song, Touré gave a slight bow; his point had been made, and with it a potent reminder of the power of Prince’s music.

During the Blind Boys of Alabama’s performance at the Berklee Performance Center Friday night, frontman Jimmy Carter was constantly laughing. When he walked onto the stage and was greeted tumultuous applause, he let out a velvety chuckle. “All right,” he exclaimed, “I wish everybody felt like that.” Carter and the rest of the Blind Boys of Alabama maintained a high level of good-humored ease until they exited the stage giggling, each with one hand placed on the shoulder in front of him.
The Blind Boys of Alabama has existed for more than 70 years, and the group’s career has been characterized by the infectious joy it exhibited on Friday night. The Blind Boys seemed to enjoy their performance just as much as their delighted audience and swayed, jived, and chuckled through their energetic set.
The group performed many songs from their new album, “Take the High Road,” and the group’s strong harmonies belied their storied history. The Blind Boys of Alabama has existed since 1939, when the group formed at Alabama Institute of the Negro Blind. The group was heavily involved in the civil rights movement, performing at benefits for Martin Luther King, Jr.,  and has since played all over the country, including at the White House. The current band consists of three blind singers, one blind drummer, and three sighted instrumentalists.
The group showed its abilities in new and old songs alike. “I Know A Place,” one of the strongest songs on “Take the High Road,” sounded powerful because its dense harmonies evoked the mood  of the protest marches in the early ’60s. The eponymous title track shone through in its simplicity: the song began with a confusing conglomeration of sound, and then all excess noise fell away so that the richly harmonized voices shone through.
The group’s rendition of the classic hymn “Amazing Grace” highlighted one of the group’s unique strengths: adding bluesy funk to traditional gospel. The prescene of a groovy synthesizer and Carter’s prolonged groans that seem to strain his voice resulted in renewed exuberance on stage and in the audience.
Needless to say, the performers seemed quite comfortable with each other and displayed their chemistry and camaraderie throughout. Visual clues are not possible with this group, but each performer is able to sense when the other is finished and jump in. Sometimes the singers literally jumped up from their seats in their exhilaration, only to be guided back down by one of the other sighted performers. Carter gave each instrumentalist a solo to “tell us how they felt,” and the singers acknowledged the musicians’ skill by bowing their heads, tapping their feet, and occasionally turning their faces transformed by admiration to the stage lights above.
Although the group formed and has had much more of a social impact in the South, Carter assured his audience that Boston was one of his favorite cities. Towards the end of the concert, he walked up and down the aisles, causing the women to genuflect and swoon and the men to thump him affectionately on his shoulder. When he got back on stage, Carter chuckled again into the microphone—a fitting end to such a joyful performance.

UPDATED: March 27th, 2012, at 3:02 PM
Last Wednesday, rap collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All performed for a raucous sold-out crowd at the House of Blues in Boston and featured songs off of their latest album, “The OF Tape Vol. 2.” Before they could finish, however, the show was shut down by the police, and one of the members was arrested. Such occurrences are not unusual for Wolf Gang, a highly antagonistic group that has sparked many debates over its offensive lyrics. Below, Caleb J. Thompson and Indiana T. Seresin engage in their own dialogue about Odd Future’s aggressive lyrical content.
POINT: Caleb Thompson
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All is an L.A.-based rap collective whose output is marked by the profane, the misogynistic, and the ultra-violent. The lyrical content of the group’s songs frequently rejoices in stories of homophobia, rape, murder, and cannibalism, but despite—or because—of this shock value, they are arguably the most talked-about group in contemporary hip-hop. While the originality and impact of their work is undisputed, the group’s attitudes toward police, women, and homosexuals have dismayed some and outraged others. Can we not reconcile this with the brilliance of the music, or is it, in fact, an integral part of what makes Odd Future so compelling?
We permit theatrical, cinematic, and literary violence a leeway that we do not always in popular music. Certainly Odd Future has written nothing more graphic than the rapes, murders, and mutilations that populate the poetry of Dante, the plays of Shakespeare, and the films of Quentin Tarantino, and yet we regard those works with a much more lenient eye. A close listen to Odd Future will reveal that the rappers who make up the collective very clearly assume lyrical personae that are far removed from their actual personalities. Tyler the Creator, the group’s talismanic frontman, raps about snorting cocaine and womanizing despite actually being a teetotaler with a long-term girlfriend. In the same sense, we can infer that his lyrics about rape and human flesh consumption are probably also fictitious. Odd Future is playing out fantasies of violence and sexual conquest just as artists in all media have done for centuries.
The same can be held for the group’s apparent treatment of homosexuality. Lyrics about queers and faggots are designed to shock, not offend. In fact, Odd Future member Syd Tha Kid is one of the few openly gay women in hip-hop and has said on record that she has never been made to feel in any way uncomfortable or “less than an equal.” The idea of censoring Tyler and his cohorts like some suggest is an attack not just on this specific group, but on the freedom of art in contemporary society to express itself. The lyrics may shock you—indeed, they are designed to—but they are simply the continuation of an artistic tradition that goes back to depictions of animal cruelty in cave paintings.
Moreover, the shock value is one of the reasons Odd Future is so important. Popular music has a long history of shock, from the first parents appalled at the sexual licentiousness supposedly encouraged in their children by the music of Elvis Presley and the Rolling Stones (a dislike often founded on racial prejudices toward rock’s origins in African-American blues music) to today. When was the last time you were really shocked by a song and really made to sit up and take notice? The magnificent blast of hatred and evil that constitutes an Odd Future record is the child of the Stones and the Sex Pistols and Public Enemy. In a world of bland, banal Rihannas and Chris Browns, Odd Future is a raucous, primal validation of what made rap so exciting in the first place.
COUNTERPOINT: Indiana Seresin 
Few critics of Odd Future actually advocate for the censorship of their music. But there is a crucial difference between fighting for censorship and generating dialogue that will make listeners think twice about the music they consume.Odd Future’s music is problematic because the rappers present rape in a way that is too close to reality.
Eminem’s “Stan” depicts a grisly suicide and murder, but the song’s letter format and “Dear Slim” introduction clearly establish the fact that Eminem is not rapping as himself but as a fictional character. In contrast, “Luper” by Odd Future rapper Earl Sweatshirt begins with a narrative that could be a realistic account of the rapper’s 16-year-old life: “Ma said, wake up son, good morning / I rolled out of bed, greeted mamma with a yawn”. What follows is a story about an unrequited high school romance that, at the end of the song, suddenly swerves into a kidnapping, rape, and murder narrative. The implication is that Earl–ordinary, teenage Earl–would be capable of, and perhaps even justified in, raping and murdering the girl at school who rejects him.
Odd Future’s fans suggest that the collective serves as an electric charge to the music industry. But this is clearly a false dichotomy. Despite the tedious homogeny of much contemporary pop music, there are many artists whose work is both lyrically and musically thrilling. And­—astonishing as it may be­—most of them still manage to achieve success without any mention of the abuse of women.
POINT:Indiana Seresin
My sister is the kind of hip-hop lover who has to post a new song to Facebook within an hour of it dropping; anything afterward is considered too late. Unsurprisingly, she was the one to introduce me to Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All. In 2008, before the group erupted, she played me tracks from the Odd Future Tape, pausing whenever the lyrics veered into a graphic description of rape.
“They’re so good,” she said. “But I don’t know if I can listen to their music.”
Three years later, the internet is bursting at the seams with blog-based arguments about whether Odd Future is “actually” misogynistic and homophobic, whether the members rap about rape to generate publicity, or whether they are simply immature and therefore harmless. This last strand of thought is most alarming because it implies that rape is something inherent to the domain of juvenescence. But these debates are irrelevant. We should be less concerned about judging whether the artists themselves are homophobic misogynists than we should be about turning a critical eye to ourselves, the listeners, and seeing how we might be implicated in the violence and hatred that fill Odd Future’s music.
One of the most alarming aspects of the group’s overnight ascent to international fame last year was the propelling role of the liberal media. Journalists writing for hip and progressive newspapers, magazines, and blogs—even the kinds normally devoted to bands with guitars and whose readership might find Kanye West controversial—fawned over the collective. In a 2010 article for the indie music website Pitchfork, Sean Fennessey delivered a cringeworthy tribute to the group, describing them as “talented,” “stunning,” “sophisticated,” “impeccable,”  “hilarious,” and “the vanguard of modern hip-hop”.  Odd Future rode the wave of these rave reviews and catapulted into the mainstream.
These articles not only fuelled the group’s success but also normalized the messages in its music. While blog writers were busy squabbling over whether Syd tha Kid’s lesbian presence in Odd Future disqualified it from being misogynistic and homophobic (I’ll make it easy: it doesn’t), nobody paid any attention to whether or not their fans were, by implication of listening to and adoring their music, misogynistic and homophobic themselves. But this transformation is exactly what has happened.  Buying an album in which the word “faggot” is said 213 times is an act of homophobia. Listening to a song where women are reduced to the dehumanized category of “bitches” is misogynistic. And yet it is almost impossible not to participate in this kind of culture.
The influence of porn, the perpetuation of rape culture, the glamorization of abuse, and the persisting presence of homophobia and heterosexism are so integrated into our society that they can often seem unavoidable and so dominant within hip-hop that they are shrugged off as normal. No wonder listeners are excited by the shock of hearing rappers describe the kidnapping and rape of a woman; within the realm of hip-hop (and, thanks to its influence, society at large) robbing a woman of her agency is both presented and perceived as sexy. And hence, we have the success of Odd Future, whose music is undeniably sexy, cool, and exciting, but for a very awful reason.
COUNTERPOINT: Caleb Thompson
The suggestion that the purchase of an Odd Future album is a homophobic act in itself because the group’s use of the word “faggot” is both risible and vaguely insulting. Women are “reduced to the dehumanized category” of shrews in Shakespeare, to say nothing of his treatment of Jews and blacks. The former are not portrayed particularly flatteringly in the works of Dickens, Dostoyevsky, or T. S. Eliot. Does performing in “The Merchant of Venice” or buying a copy of “The Brothers Karamazov” make one an anti-Semite?
Ultimately, those who choose not to listen are well within their rights to abstain—and to not be criticized for their abstention—but do not have the prerogative to condemn those who do. The liberty of artists to express themselves is one of the absolute freedoms of a democratic society, as is the freedom of the listener to decide whether or not he is offended. Any attempt by a third party to contravene either of these—to suggest that the artist is objectively homophobic or misogynistic because he or she has produced a work that apparently expresses these attitudes, or that the listener is objectively homophobic or misogynistic because he or she choose to listen to such a work—is not just anti-democratic, but intuitively wrong.

Shamrocks? Clovers? Leprechauns riding magical marshmallows across a rainbow? You’d be out of luck looking for these at the 13th Annual Irish Film Festival, Boston, where depictions of the Emerald Isle instead included a champion boxer, a soccer-crazed altar boy, and a drug-transporting lamb. The festival, held at the Somerville Theatre and Brattle Theatre last weekend, featured a medley of shorts, feature-length films, and documentaries.
Boston Irish Film Festival Productions, a nonprofit organization, has been working since 1999 to showcase Irish cinema in the Boston area. This festival is the largest of its kind outside of Ireland, and the organization means to provide a gateway for Irish films into American cinemas. Guests at the festival were invited to attend the screenings, chat with filmmakers and actors, and, of course, attend after-party pub outings in the local area. “I like to tell people in Boston that after they go to the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, [they should] come here to see a real bit of Ireland,” festival co-director Dawn Morrissey says. The Roving Reporter visited the festival to do just that.
John McIlduff, director of “Behold the Lamb”
RR: Your film includes a dead dog, drug trafficking, and a disabled child. It has been said to have a fetish for misery—any thoughts on that?
JM: Honestly, I don’t think it’s that dark of a film. I mean, yes, it does have its darker parts, but there’s also that element of hope that you’re left with in the end. If you thought this was dark, you should have seen my first drafts…. I sort of gave it the Disney ending here [laughs]. But in many ways I consider this more of a Norse film. Now, those guys are dark. No sun there. I think it does something to their brains.
RR: Norse, huh? So what, then, makes the film Irish?
JM: The things that make this film Irish are very non-explicit. For me, it was textural, as far as color quality, the textures. I wanted to make something very much like Northern Ireland, where I come from. We’re very cold people—we’re very closed. I don’t know whether it was the problems or the conflicts we had there, but I wanted to have a film that talked about that.... I mean, I lived through all of that. That’s where I think it’s Irish—on that deep fundamental level, as opposed to it being something you can pinpoint.
RR: In your movie there’s a pretty large role played by a drug-smuggling lamb. Will I find one if I visit Ireland?
JM: I hope not, because I actually patented that [laughs].
Aoife Duffin, actress in “Behold the Lamb”
RR: Your character is pretty dark. How was it fitting into that role?
AD: It worked, really, just right from the beginning….  [My character,] Liz, she doesn’t do very much. She’s quite closed, doesn’t give you that much…. Irish films are like that sometimes—a little slow, something you really have to think about…. The humor, it’s a little dark, yes, but also refreshing here in Boston—you know? The humor here seems to be on the same level as that as Ireland. Like when I tossed the lamb over that wall, everyone responded pretty well here, but in France it was more like [gasps], “Oh no!”
RR: So, just how Irish are you?
AD: How American are you? Of course, I’m 100 percent. We got top hats, the leprechauns, and a little pot of gold at the end of the rainbow by our home. The leprechaun suits, too. I got one of those. Make sure you get one if you come visit.
RR: How could I not?
Edward K. Crawford, film producer
RR: What keeps you coming to the festival?
ECK: Just the nature and the quality of the films…. Even with the internet, we’re not always able to see shorts, 15-minute films…. Some of the shorts here are phenomenal. We just watched one here with an altar boy who was very into football.
RR: “Pentecost,” right? What does that mean?
ECK: It’s a—a Christian feast. Not quite up on my Catholic [traditions]…. The other thing, as well, “Pentecost” has so many big names. Just shows you the health of the industry in Ireland, you know? You got to pay five, ten thousand dollars a day for big names. Burt Reynolds, fifty thousand, I hear. It’s great just to see actors of that caliber just working for something that doesn’t offer immediate remuneration, but doing it for the pleasure…. To see quality work that’s pleasing to not just an Irish audience but those outside it too—it’s a real source of pride.
RR: So what are you going to do now?
ECK: We’re going to get a pint, of course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“When I was trekking across Brooklyn, looking for emcee battles—and believe me, there were plenty of those—I would never have dreamed I would be standing at this podium,” said Gary Grice, better known by his emcee names GZA and The Genius, in a talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday. “I must say, it feels very intimidating,” the emcee added. MIT Associate Professor of Comparative Media Studies Ian R. Condry ’87 moderated the lecture and discussion, entitled “GZA @ MIT: Hip-Hop as Civic Media.” In the talk, GZA focused on his growth as an artist and, in parallel, the development of hip-hop as a worldwide cultural unifier. He spoke softly and slowly, rapping excerpts a capella throughout the talk to a hushed audience.
GZA is a founding member of the seminal hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan and a widely acclaimed solo rapper in his own right. He visited MIT in December to learn more about the school’s scientific research, which he has used as a source of lyrical inspiration for his forthcoming album, “Dark Matter.” At the talk, GZA gave shout-outs to the MIT professors and students who showed him their research. However, he did not discuss the new material further. 
Instead, GZA delved into how his adolescence in New York gave him respect for the craft of hip-hop lyricism. He described growing up in the burgeoning hip-hop scene with a series of vignettes, such as his attempts at making graffiti art with a ruler and the trips he took by “bus, boat, train, then bus” from Staten Island to battle other emcees with cousins and future Wu-Tang members RZA and Ol’ Dirty Bastard. “I remember going to the park and seeing these young poets, and I was blown away,” he said of visiting the Bronx. “I found my calling, and I said, ‘This is what I really want to do.’” 
GZA claimed that Wu-Tang had built one of the largest brands in all of hip-hop and recounted that he had met people who had tattooed the Wu-Tang symbol on their body in shows of dedication. “I’ve seen a dude who had the Wu logo tatted on his face. I mean his whole face was tatted, but the Wu was the biggest thing on his face,” GZA said. “That is a statement, something that means a lot to us.” 
Though he discussed his youth and Wu-Tang’s later international success, GZA spoke little about the formation and early rise of the group. “RZA had this idea—form Wu-Tang, ‘Protect Ya Neck,’ ‘Enter the 36 Chambers,’ you know—and now we’re here. Boom,” he said, quickly condensing the group’s history since their 1993 breakthrough song and album.
He emphasized that as hip-hop’s popularity had exploded, the genre gathered devotees worldwide. He noted that Wu-Tang’s success, from the group’s rise to mainstream acclaim to its current status as elder statesmen of hip-hop, has been international. “We’ve never toured in Africa, and yet, I’m constantly being told that people have visited certain countries in every corner of the continents, and seen people wearing Wu-Tang t-shirts all over.” With its global spread, he claimed, hip-hop was also adopted as a medium for discourse and resistance. “Hip-hop became the voice of rebellion and the youth, as rock music did in the ’60s,” he said.
GZA also claimed that the Wu-Tang Clan was responsible for introducing the world outside of Asia to kung fu. “You will see that samurai movies were sampled [by hip-hop artists] much later in Japan than in the U.S,” said Condry, who has written a book on Japanese hip-hop. “It was not seen as too cool. It would be like American rappers sampling cowboy movies.” Only recently, Condry said, have these Asian artists adopted such native cultural signifiers. “It kind of makes sense if you think about it, a dynamics of [what becomes] cool. It’s so dependent on context and history and what you already know,” Condry said.
GZA has rapped about such diverse and nontraditional subjects as chess moves, swordsmanship, and now cutting-edge science, but he seemed at a loss for words when asked why rap lyricism has not moved away from misogynistic and homophobic content. “I really can’t answer that,” he said, pausing. “It just hasn’t.” He went on to clarify that he believed there needed to be a more positive and uplifting paradigm in rap music, but says he is reluctant to address such themes in his own works.
Condry elaborated on that outlook. “It’s a mistake for us to look for politics entirely in the artists. The politics of hip-hop has to be with us, the audience, the fans,” he said.
At the end of the lecture, GZA was presented with an MIT hoodie, which he quickly discerned was too small for him. “That ain’t hood!” he jokingly shouted. It seemed an apt reflection of the unlikely partnership between MIT and himself—another sign of how widespread and widely respected hip-hop has become.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am in the basement of the Natural History Museum at Harvard surrounded by glass jars of eerie creatures, some of which died 150 years ago. There are encased shrimps to my right and left. “This label was written by Louis Agassiz around 1850,” says Adam Baldinger, curatorial associate and collection manager in the invertabrate zoology department at the museum. He takes me to his office and points to a shelf of specimens wrapped in cotton balls and submerged in vials of 70 percent alcohol. “You see that shelf up there? There’s about a dozen new species waiting to be identified.” The possibility of new species seems exciting, even if the creatures are pale, many-legged things that died quite some time ago. Yet for Baldinger, who cares for multiple collections at the museum and can discover up to a dozen unidentified species per year, it is just another part of his job.
On the surface, it may seem that museum curators just manage collections. Curators do oversee the finer points of their exhibits, such as arranging the space so that visitors do not trip over misplaced Indian headdresses, but their role encompasses much more. They must pick the pieces for the exhibit and organize them in a conceptually engaging way.
It is the curator’s job to maintain the immediacy of the work of art or preserved specimens; they must attract visitors even when photos of most artworks and historic objects are available as high definition images online. They bear immense knowledge of the past, but they are also able to present this knowledge in a way that conveys the passion that drew them to the field in the first place. Ultimately, curators’ appreciation for objects allows them to elucidate these artifacts for the public.
UNRAVELING THE FLAG
A curator, according to the Online Etymology Dictionary, originated as a word used to describe managers, overseers, and caretakers, usually of minors or lunatics. The definition of curator that we know today emerged in the 1660s when churches recognized the need for a position to maintain relics and other fragile and aging parts of cathedrals and monasteries. Today, curator is a word sometimes used too broadly to refer to any person who is involved in the behind-the-scenes workings of a museum. In reality, there are archivists, curatorial associates, special collections librarians, and exhibit designers who work to put together the layout and content of exhibits.
“We think through what is going to happen at a show, where people will passage, how to make sure people don’t trip over things, what to do with pedestals, what to do with lighting, and all those kind of superficial things about a show,” says Kathy Caraccio, who owns a small gallery in New York City. But curators are also responsible for collecting the works of art, sometimes flying to multiple countries to acquire works from other museums. Their tasks also include  compiling catalogs, keeping track of the history of the pieces on display, and organizing their exhibits in a way that engages the public.
Archivists occupy the niche that most closely resembles the original definition of the word “curator.” They assess, collect, organize, and preserve objects of value. “Sometimes it’s things the alumni brought back from World War II, like an 18-foot Nazi flag, but also objects such as a brick that marked the grave of our first African-American graduate,” says Diane Shaw, the director of special collections and archivist at Lafayette College.
Universities can collect an amazing breadth of objects in their lifetimes; at an institution as old as Harvard, some collections are older than most universities. “What you see on exhibit here is less than one percent of our collection,” says I. Castle McLaughlin, associate curator of North American ethnography at Harvard’s Peabody Museum.
 DINING ON CASSATT 
The word “curator” is not a word that a child generally learns to speak before age ten. Therefore, it is tough to imagine a kid saying, “I want to be a curator when I grow up,” with the same sincere enthusiasm as a child might say, “I want to be a firefighter,” or, “I want to be a rock star.”
And indeed, curators arrive at their careers in a variety of ways. Caraccio is primarily a master printer, which means she receives etchings from professional artists and produces their prints by manually rolling a large metal wheel over paper, pressing ink into the indentations. Caraccio became a curator because she needed to display prints in an attractive, coherent manner for her customers. Now artists contact her from all over the world to ask if she will display their work at her gallery. Caraccio also teaches student interns at the National Academy School of Fine Art how to curate in her “hit-and-run tutorial program.”
Some curators start as history majors in college. Shaw became a curator and archivist by working at her alma mater, Emory University, in the Special Collections department. Then there’s Barbara Shapiro, who arrived in her line of work as a curator for the Boston Fine Arts Museum by offering to volunteer at the museum.
There are paintings and prints covering every wall of Shapiro’s apartment, many from artists she had worked with in the past. One wall is devoted to her alphabetized collection of art books and art catalogs. She also has an impressive collection of painted bowls and plates, some by the artist Mary Cassatt. Shapiro is able to recall without pause the story behind each object. One print was purchased at an auction; another was a gift from a friend. Judging from her devotion, it is hard to believe she was nearly barred from entering the field.
In the 1950s, Shapiro asked Harvard’s Fogg Museum if she could volunteer; she had a longtime love of prints and paintings. At the time, Shapiro, a mother of three, was turned away and was advised to stay at home with her children. Undeterred, Shapiro volunteered at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, took print-making classes at Radcliffe College and eventually got a masters degree in art history from Wellsley College. “By the time I went to Wellesley, Harvard was opening up for women, both married and single,” she says.
Shapiro’s story stands in marked contrast to how people—male and female—become curators today. Harvard is now a very welcoming place for curators to learn. Jennifer Quick is a Ph.D. student here and interns at the Fogg Museum, the same place Shapiro tried to volunteer 50 years ago. In fact, the Fogg Museum is primarily a teaching museum.
Quick has been working on a student-curated show on Jasper Johns that will open on May 22 in the Sackler Museum. Quick hopes to go into academia rather than purely curatorial work, but like Shapiro, she appreciates learning about the technical aspects of curation.  “What prints should we put there to really draw the viewer in? When a visitor is standing at the far side of the gallery, how can we generate visual interest from that distance?” she asks, gesturing with her hands to communicate spatial orientation in a gallery.
LIVE EXHIBIT
Curators have to be excellent storytellers and capable of remembering an impressive amount about the works and specimens on display. It is all about the way a story is told, and in an exhibit, the plotline of an artist’s life, or the history of a group of people, progresses visually as one walks through the space.
Curators tell their stories by choosing pieces that compliment each other and illustrate the theme of the exhibit. As for more pragmatic concerns, curators must organize the gallery in a stress-free, logical manner. “One of the main challenges of curation is trying to get the pieces to fill a space,” Caraccio says. For example, if a curator wants to maintain the intimacy of certain pieces of art in a very large, open space, he or she might put a small piece of art in the corner of a huge room so that the visitor must walk over to the piece to see it.
If a curator works in the same space for a long period of time, as often is the case with curators employed by a university or an art gallery, he or she has to employ diverse methods to make the space feel different for each exhibit. Some curators choose to work with moveable parts. Caraccio hangs prints on magnetic wires so visitors may purchase particular pieces on display. Shaw uses freestanding vitrines, glass-paneled cases, which she can move around the space to change the organization of the room.
Most significantly, a curator must consider the atmosphere of an exhibit, which entails many aspects a visitor may not consciously notice. It is small things like the texture of the floor that matter when your job is ensuring that visitors are in a comfortable position to receive and appreciate information.
THUNDER AND BIRD SONG
McLaughlin, an associate curator at Harvard’s Peabody Museum, walks through “Wiyopiyata,” the exhibit on the Lakota people. First she points out a large mural over the entrance to the exhibit, drawn by Lakota artist Butch Thunder Hawk. “We wanted to have this here to let the visitors know they’re entering a Lakota Place,” McLaughlin says. Walking further into the exhibit, peals of thunder and bird song pour out of speakers above her head. The sound of the rain and wind creates a hush over visitors. The audio was actually collected from Lakota territory by McLaughlin’s colleagues.
McLaughlin points out other subtle decisions about the exhibit’s organization. The spears and arrows are set into a wall that is painted with a landscape of the Midwest plains to create a sense of a three-dimensional environment. A map of Montana and bits of surrounding states is on the floor, providing an interactive element to the exhibit; a visitor can walk over the site of General Custer’s battle or part of the Oregon Trail.
McLaughlin’s ability to create larger stories from specific artifacts is crucial in curation and particularly evident in this exhibit. The “Wiyopiyata” exhibit focuses on a specific object, a ledger found in Houghton Library’s archives. The ledger, lost and rediscovered in largely unknown circumstances, contains rare paper drawings of the Lakota warriors’ martial exploits.
McLaughlin tells detailed stories while highlighting the important aspects of each portion of the exhibit. There is a group of spoons displayed in a circle in front of a decorated elk hide. When she describes the common Lakota practice of sharing meals and stories, McLaughlin’s voice becomes melodic; she is weaving the story now. She makes sure to mention the specific choice of arranging the spoons in a circle to mimic how the Lakotas would sit during these evening gatherings.
The exhibit has a technological component as well and this raises significant questions for a curator. If an exhibit incorporates technology, the curator must consider where to place the TV or computer so that it is easy to access but does not become the central aspect of the exhibit. For McLaughlin, the answer was putting the TV screen, which shows interviews she conducted with modern-day Lakotas, in a room slightly off to the side of the main exhibit. This way, visitors could sit on a bench to watch the interviews and rest their legs before walking through to the next exhibit.
LABELS VERSUS LINKS
According to urbandictionary.com, “museum legs” is defined as “the aching legs one develops after a prolonged period of slow walking interspersed with standing still, especially when going round a museum.” Instead of a tiring bout of museum legs, we can now effortlessly peruse magnified photos of the masterpieces or click on links to Wikipedia bios of the artists.
As in every profession, there is concern when it comes to keeping up with an increasingly digital world. “I have said, you know, everyone is going digital, so let me hold on to my traditional knowledge,” Caraccio says. “Every student now has the ability to think through a computer, and what they don’t have is the ability to think through their hands.”
A curator’s livelihood is based on preserving a certain awe of objects and presenting them in a particular fashion that, from his or her knowledgeable standpoint, seems most appropriate. The accessibility of the internet allows viewers to look up the objects themselves. Though this means the museum’s reach is greatly extended by this technology, it also changes the nature of typical visitor-exhibit interaction. But perhaps technology does not have to destroy the sanctity of a museum space. Quick, the curatorial intern at Harvard, worked on an exhibit that incorporated an iPad into the display. The iPad was open to the museum’s online catalog so that visitors could scroll through the archives with their fingers. This form of integrating technology brings the internet into the exhibit rather than the exhibit onto the internet.
But some people like Baldinger, curatorial associate at Harvard’s Natural History Museum, whose job includes preserving historical data, find it best to leave technology out of the picture. “The best way to preserve a piece of data is a good piece of paper and a good pen, provided you have neat handwriting,” he says, touring the shelves of preserved species. Thanks to curators, information like this will be available for the next few centuries. Though the labels inside the glass preservative jars in the basement of Harvard’s Natural History Museum may have different handwriting, the knowledge is ultimately preserved along with its artifact.

As music director for the Lowell House Opera’s production of Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Snegurochka” (“The Snow Maiden”), Lidiya V. Yankovskaya brings an interdisciplinary approach to an unusual opera. A conductor and Russian native trained in piano, voice, and violin, Yankovskaya studied music, philosophy, and language at Vassar College and then received a master’s degree in conducting from Boston University. “Snegurochka” is the third Harvard production for which she has directed music; previously, she served as music co-director for LHO’s production of “Candide,” by Leonard Bernstein ’39, and as music director for the Harvard Yiddish Players’ staging of Avrum Goldfaden’s operetta “Shulamis.”
Under Yankovskaya’s baton, LHO presented the first fully staged, Russian-language U.S. production of “Snegurochka,” Rimsky-Korsakov’s personal favorite of his operas. According to Yankovskaya, she and cast vocalist Irina Petrik also translated the first English supertitles for the opera. The show opened on Wednesday and will run from March 28 to 31. 
 
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you start directing music for opera rather than pursuing only singing and instrumental performance?
Lidiya V. Yankovskaya: In opera, you have this amazing combination of so many elements. I get to work with instrumentalists, which I love to do. I get to also conduct choirs and work with individual singers. I get to play piano and accompany singers and coach them in rehearsal. What’s even more exciting is the ability to work with the production team, to work with the stage directors and designers to really bring [the opera] to life, to really delve into its core.
 
THC: What is your vision for “Snegurochka?”
LVY: Many of performances take a very early-20th-century Romantic approach to the piece and often ignore things that the composer writes. This was the style back then. In Russian conservatories, they used to teach that anytime anything is louder, play faster, and anything softer, play slower…. Always, as a conductor, it’s hard to know what part of the tradition comes from the original, from the composer, and what of the tradition got added on over the years. I try very hard to find a balance between those traditional interpretations and sticking to what the composer wrote.
 
THC: Why do you think this particular opera had yet to be fully staged in the original Russian in the U.S.?
LVY: I think part of it is just that Russian operas in general haven’t been performed that much.… [“Snegurochka”] relies very heavily on Russian folklore. So the entire opera revolves around a pagan festival that a Russian audience would [understand]…. And I think, especially until recent years, people shied away from exploring artistic works of any type that really delve deeply into unknown cultures…. Also, the music is challenging, so you need strong fingers and a full orchestra. In Boston, of all the professional opera companies, there’s no pit that could fit this opera. It’s not ideal to have an orchestra in front of a stage, but we’ve managed to make it work.
 
THC: Did you want to stage “Snegurochka” because it is less frequently performed?
LVY: I actually did not realize how few performances it had received in the United States when I was looking at it. In Eastern Europe it’s a staple, a standard, and much more popular. I do a lot of new music, and I am drawn to rarely performed works, so that certainly appealed to me when I realized it, but it certainly wasn’t the main factor…. This opera really lends itself to younger voices. It also involves the chorus in really interesting ways.
THC: What was it like teaching Russian, in which most of the vocalists have little training, to the cast?
LVY: Almost all of the Russian-speaking singers have helped in teaching the American singers. I paired them up, and we worked from there. I’ve done a lot of coaching myself in the past.
 
THC: Have you been able to include your knowledge of language and philosophy in your musical career?
LVY: I studied literature as part of language studies, and opera is also literature. It’s music, but it’s also literature, and it’s also theatre, visual arts, and many different things. So, certainly, as I interpret these libretti and go through them, that is something that I really apply and inevitably think about…. Basically, studying philosophy made me think about things in a creative way. I apply it to interpret the meaning behind a certain opera or try to think about the philosophical, social, and ethical implication of what’s on stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Olympia J. Snowe’s sudden and unexpected announcement that she was retiring from the Senate sent shockwaves throughout the nation that went well beyond the electoral calculus. The retirement signaled a recognition that something had been lost in American politics, that the political moderate was part of an era that had passed. Following her announcement, Snowe criticized the Senate for failing to be a body “that ensures all voices are heard and considered.” In the wake of her statement, many fingers were pointed—at the Tea Party, MoveOn.org, and other political organizations—to explain the loss of respect within politics. Yet, by design, the Congress represents the nation and people that elect it. When Americans stop respecting opposing opinions, we can’t expect Congress not to follow our lead. Unfortunately, Harvard, too, is far from innocent in America’s race to incivility. We can’t turn around what happens in Washington without first changing what happens in the Yard.
As the “Kremlin on the Charles,” Harvard is famous for its liberal reputation and infamous for its intolerance of dissenting opinions. When prospective freshmen arrive at the activities fair each year at Visitas, the most common question they ask at the Harvard Republican Club’s table is not “What activities do you have?” or “How many members do you have?” but “Can I be conservative here?”
Posters from the Harvard Republican Club, Harvard Right to Life, and True Love Revolution have all been targeted recently. The vast majority of all three groups’ posters are consistently torn down within hours of being put up. HRL’s “Cemetery of the Unborn”  display outside of the Science Center was even vandalized in 2008. One instance of missing posters could possibly be explained by other, non-malicious factors, but multiple years of vandalism against Harvard’s three main conservative groups cannot.
Posters may cover the surface of Harvard’s campus, but the lack of respect within the institution runs deep. Students participating in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps have reported that some professors “exhibit hostility toward students who wear their uniform to class.” Members of the Class of 2014 reported to the Harvard Republican Club and its mentor faculty that their faculty advisers and Peer Advising Fellows had discouraged them from taking classes taught by conservative faculty members, not because the classes didn’t fit within their interests or schedules, but because the instructors were conservative. The destructive ripples of such   interactions extend far beyond a course schedule.
When freshmen arrive on campus, they are encouraged to begin discussing topics both big and small during mandatory Community Conversations with their entryways and proctors. They are told to appreciate diversity and understand different perspectives but are then marginalized and isolated by the very community and staff that are meant to welcome then. When freshmen mentors criticize professors for the sole reason that they are conservative, the message sent to freshmen is clear: those who disagree with us are not welcome here. It leaves the freshmen that disagree with Harvard’s liberal mainstream two options: Hide their beliefs for the next four years or take the risk and challenge the status quo. To freshmen attempting to find their way and determine their identity as lone adults for the first time, the intolerance is terrifying and paralyzing. Many elect at this moment never to reveal their true opinions throughout their entire time here.
For students here who break with the liberal majority, taking the road less traveled requires accepting much more than just fewer travel companions. The road also involves the personal attacks, the vandalism, the constant judgment, and the discrimination. Conservative freshmen arrive on this campus with the expectation that they will be challenged, and they should. As former HRC President Mark A. Isaacson ’11 pointed out last year, being challenged in intellectual dialogue can be an immensely rewarding experience. But such debate requires an initial respect for opposing viewpoints, which we have lost.
As a result of the culture that students and the administration have built at Harvard today, real intellectual discussions occur in increasingly isolated circles among blockmates and friends. Trust that should naturally exist between students and mentors requires time to build before students are willing to reveal their true beliefs. Debates do not occur or become increasingly one-sided, and those honest discussions that are supposed to lead to further enlightenment in seminars and in common rooms never occur. When conservative groups are driven from public debate and ROTC students are driven from the classroom, we all lose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year my earnest freshman self published an article with the inflammatory title of “Liberals vs. the Constitution.” This article will present a more moderate argument, yet I couldn’t resist the opportunity to become an equal opportunity exasperator with another inflammatory title.
My previous piece endorsed originalism, the doctrine that constitutional law should be based solely on the original meaning or understanding of the Constitution, including its amendments. For this I received flak from Sam Barr at the Harvard Political Review, who argued, “the Constitution enshrines principles and goals, not only means.” Barr suggested, for example, that though the Constitution only specifically authorizes establishing “Post Offices and Post Roads,” airmail is constitutional because the clause was actually meant to provide for mail delivery in general.
Quite right. Besides specific provisions such as those designating the minimum age for running for Congress, the Constitution embodies national principles and goals. Furthermore, the substantive meaning of these principles and the best means of achieving these goals change over time. Flogging was once a common method of discipline in America. Now, however, virtually all Americans consider flogging “cruel and unusual punishment,” and even the originalist Antonin Scalia says he would hold flogging unconstitutional out of deference to evolved public opinion, though the “cruel and unusual punishment” clause has never been amended.
The framers intended the federal government to have the power to regulate all matters of a national dimension, so they granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. Prior to the 1930s, “interstate commerce” was generally interpreted as meaning only the movement of goods and services across state lines for sale. Local production and intrastate commerce were considered outside the reach of Congressional regulation, not because of a conviction that Congress should never regulate such activities, but because they had no substantial effect on interstate commerce and thus on the general welfare of the nation in 1787. In today’s interwoven national economy, they do. Thus, a principles-and-goals originalist reading of the Commerce Clause can easily endorse measures such as the Clean Air Act or the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Originalism need not be stuck in 1787.
Unfortunately, this is not the style of originalism practiced by most self-professed adherents today. Most originalists diligently search only for the framers’ intent or the public’s original understanding of Constitutional text in the sense of what they thought or would have thought about specific issues, like the 1964 Civil Rights Act, gay rights, or the Environmental Protection Agency. This, when they should be searching for the goals or principles Americans enshrined in 1787 (like equality, personal autonomy, and a commitment to the general welfare) and what those mean to Americans today as applied to the modern world.
Conservative originalists of this stripe threaten the Constitution’s ability to adapt to a changing nation. While in an ideal world all changes in constitutional interpretation would come through amendments, we now have a long history of changing our constitutional law more by judicial reinterpretation than by amendment. Trying to change that now would destabilize our constitutional law and do more harm than good.
But neither do we need untethered liberal constitutionalism. While we need an evolving Constitution in the sense that its interpretation changes as Americans develop new consensuses on its principles, there is less apparent value in the so-called “Living Constitution” that could better be described as a “Rubber Band Constitution.” Rubber band constitutionalists see our founding document not as an expression of national consensus on fundamental principles, but as a vehicle for imposing, as far as possible, the morality of a minority on the rest of the country. They realize the Constitution can only be stretched so far to fit their agenda, or the rubber band will snap and the Supreme Court will lose its legitimacy and power, but they have no principled qualms about making decisions that clash with the consensus of the people they are ultimately supposed to derive their power from.
Of course, such adherents do not admit as much. Their public arguments sound very much like mine here. The crucial difference, however, is that I believe changes in the interpretation of constitutional principles should only come after the formation of a new broad national consensus, difficult as that point may be to determine. Rubber band constitutionalists believe changes should come whenever moral (in their opinion) and feasible. Though the morality they seek to impose on America may in some cases be more just, as a constitutional doctrine it is an attempt to transform the judiciary into a super-legislature that governs with little consent from the people.
Rubber band constitutionalism takes too much power away from the people. Shoddy originalism leaves us stuck in 1787. Our best choice is principles-and-goals originalism, or what some might call common law constitutionalism, which allows our Constitution to adapt to changing times while assuring that it still remains the unifying document of our sprawling and diverse nation.

A few weeks ago, a chart by Fox News titled “Unemployment Rate Under Obama” appeared on my Facebook newsfeed. It consisted of a line graph intersecting a dozen or so data points, each representing the unemployment rate for a given month. It showed what appeared to be a plateau in unemployment in recent months.
At first glance, the chart seemed utterly unremarkable: each axis is labeled, there is a title, a source is credited, and each axis does not appear immediately misleading. Upon closer examination, however, you’ll notice that the 8.6 percent unemployment rate cited by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in November is actually above the 9 percent axis gridline. Although the numbers clearly suggest that the unemployment rate has decreased from 9 percent to 8.6 percent, the trend line shows no change.
I don’t want to target Fox News as the sole perpetrator of misinformation. To be fair, left-leaning news sources have published misleading or inaccurate charts, and it’s unclear whether such inaccuracies are accidental or deliberate. Yet the question of bias in the news media is a larger issue; right now my concern is with the way popular media sources present data.
In 2010, I wrote an article that called for new standards for defining news versus opinion programming.  In that piece, I highlighted the dangers of the public misunderstanding news from opinion, and offered a potential solution: new standards, much like television ratings, that are displayed at the beginning of a program to highlight whether that particular programming is news or opinion programming. Those standards, I argued, should be determined by an unbiased third party, and continually revised if deemed appropriate.
The Fox News chart I described above, however, got me thinking. Is there any way we can make the manner in which televisions programs display their data more transparent?
We could, for example, require that a broadcast actually show a source’s data rather than just displaying a citation. For example, should a broadcast display a chart based on a source’s data, they would also display the chart used in the source document (or, if a chart is not used, a table of the source’s data). This way, broadcasts can avoid instances such as the one above. With such changes as this, viewers would clearly see that a source’s chart would look different than the one provided by the news source. Sure, there would be many more redundant charts broadcast on news programming, but I suspect that many “simple” errors would be eliminated this way.
A more interesting and advanced way to improve the reliability of data on news programs involves the use of smartphone technology and audio tagging apps such as Shazam. Shazam identifies songs based on a few seconds of audio input. Now that there are more there are more American adults who use smartphones than more basic “feature” phones, broadcasts could incorporate Shazam technology whenever they present data from a source. Viewers could audio tag that data through their Shazam app, taking the viewer directly to the source information that was used in the broadcast or related links based on the source information. Thus, viewers would have nearly instantaneous access to the source information right on their smartphones (or tablets, etc.), and can make their own decision as to whether the data was used accurately. Yes, this would require viewers to be more proactive, but it is an innovative way to improve media transparency radically.
While these solutions do not get to the root problem of media bias, they are positive steps toward a more transparent set of guidelines for data usage. At a minimum, these solutions encourage a broader public debate on media transparency and how we can encourage more accurate use of data in broadcast programming. In their most powerful form however, these solutions represent the first steps towards a more factually accurate and transparent media industry that engages its viewers in a meaningful way.

News last week that Das Racist and the Cataracs will be the main acts performing at Harvard’s 2012 Yardfest is unlikely to excite die-hard fans of the Top 40. After The Crimson confirmed the line-up from the groups themselves, some online reaction was swift. On Harvard FML—great arbiters of students discourse its commenters no doubt are—the most discussed post on March 21 was the following: “Cataracts and Das Racist? Who are those people? Why do we let disgusting indie hipsters run our lives? FOL.” “Indie hipsters” is, of course, only partly fair to Das Racist and the Cataracs, both of which are hip-hop groups, based in respectively in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. True, these are not the “most mainstream” acts, but equally they hardly qualify as the most indie, alternative choices that Harvard’s event board could possibly select. More to the point, performances that are a little out-of-the-ordinary should always be welcome at an annual “festival” like Yardfest.
Neither group should feel any pressure to prove their credentials to skeptical Harvardians. Das Racist, perhaps most famous for its 2011 single “Pizza Hut Tacco Bell Combination” that has come to epitomize its refreshing blend of rap and humor, achieved broad recognition and plaudits for its first commercial album, “Relax,” released last September. The Cataracs’ work, much of it well known on campus, includes “Top of the World,” viewed over 23 million times on YouTube, and cannot be dismissed as an esoteric indie-alternative group without broad appeal. The group produced and wrote 2010’s “Like a G6,” which was sung by last Yardfest’s headline act Far East Movement. So while one group continues a sharp rise to fame, the other will no doubt continue to produce its own interesting content while working with some of the most talented artists in the industry.
That these groups have not quite, or not yet, reached the same level of superstardom as some of their peers is a good thing. With each season’s newest (or “freshest”) and most listened-to hip-hop, R&B, and occasional electronic singles on perpetual repeat cycle at college events and parties, America’s most popular songs can hold a monotonous grip on daily life. At parties, in the dining hall, in stores, the music is always the same. Some kind of audio stimulation that Harvard students might not have been exposed to three times a day for the past two months is hence very welcome.
While other universities meanwhile spend large sums attracting the most in-demand acts, Harvard can avoid such extravagant expenditure on performances that really aren’t worth it. Note, for example, the extra sums Columbia University shelled out for last year’s Bacchanal, its own equivalent of Yardfest, to pay for Snoop Dogg’s appearance. Without doubt, recruiting T-Pain and Tiësto respectively for Yale and the University of Pennsylvania’s Spring Flings must not come cheap either. Detractors of indie groups should also consider that mainstream rap and electronic dance music often prove the most divisive of all styles in campus communities.
Aside from the main point that constantly played “mainstream” acts are often very expensive to hire, Harvard students should conversely bear in mind that they do not pay for Yardfest, or at least don’t pay for it directly. No one has exactly been forced to buy an expensive concert ticket for something they don’t want to see. Instead, this can be an opportunity to embrace choices that push many toward music they don’t habitually listen to or, in this case, fast food combinations that may initially sound unappetizing.
More importantly, it is not obvious how much the presence of well-known but not universally loved hip-hop groups over a generic Top 40 artist will do to change Yardfest’s core function on campus. Again, Yardfest is not a concert to which individuals have bought tickets in order to see a specific artist. The event is instead about celebrating on a boozy Sunday, while pretending that (likely non-existent) hot spring weather is here to stay and Harvard students are always convivial in each other’s company. So if you like hip-hop with a twist, then celebrate. If not, admit the music is probably not the main factor you consider when choosing whether or not to go to the annual spectacle that is Yardfest.

Winthrop’s Senior Common Room Speaker Series will receive funding from the David B. Perini and Robert W. Woods Memorial Endowment Fund, established by Winthrop House alumni John J. Cullinane ’86 and William N. Thorndike ’86 to commemorate their deceased roommates.
The series will feature congressional candidate Joe Kennedy III as its inaugural speaker and has been renamed in honor of Perini ’86 and Woods ’86.
“Stephanie and I wish to extend a special thanks to John Cullinane and Will Thorndike for their generosity and for their dedication to and love for Winthrop House,” Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. wrote in an email to Winthrop residents. “We pledge to work diligently to ensure that this endowed speaker series well serves the memory of David Perini and Bob Woods.”
The SCR speaker series was a major project undertaken by Sullivan and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, during their tenure as Co-House Masters, and has featured many prominent speakers.
“We’ve had everyone from politicians to magicians, quite literally,” Sullivan said. “We’ve had everybody from Noam Chomsky to one end and Grover Norquist at the other end of the political spectrum.”
Kennedy, a graduate of Harvard Law School, is grandson of Robert F. Kennedy and son of former Congressman Joseph Kennedy II. His campaign in Mass. Fourth District marks the first foray into politics by the youngest generation of the famed Massachusetts political family.
According to Winthrop House Committee Co-Chair Lauren E. Tiedemann ’13, Winthrop’s SCR speaker series are highly popular amongst undergraduates. Although the events are capped at fifteen attendees, they are frequently over-enrolled.
Sullivan said that the endowment will allow for greater flexibility within the speaker series. Brian Wright O’Connor ’78, who has worked with Winthrop House tutor Luke A. Leafgren to organize the series, shared these views, adding that the endowment would allow Winthrop to give speakers overnight lodging.
“Not everyone we want is here on other business or has the resources to travel independently. It’s nice to have a budget,” O’Connor said. “That’s very generous of Messrs. Cullinane and Thorndike.”

“Finding Your Roots,” a new PBS series developed by Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, launched Sunday.
The series aims to uncover the tales underlying the genealogies of a diverse group of accomplished guests ranging from the influential newswoman Barbara Walters to beloved actor Robert Downey, Jr. to former United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Gates, who has also produced the series “Black in Latin America” (2011) and “Faces of America” (2010), said “Finding Your Root” aims to spur discussion about the complexity of the American identity. He said he endeavors to challenge viewers to reconsider notions of identity and re-evaluate what they think they know about themselves and those around them.  The show investigates people from all backgrounds in order to impact the greatest number of people, according to Gates.
“[“Finding Your Roots”] deconstructs the notion of race—forces us to ask what is an American identity and what is African American identity or what is Jewish identity,” said Gates.
In the inaugural episode, Gates investigated the ancestry of Grammy and Emmy award winner Henry Connick Jr., and Grammy award winning saxophonist Branford Marsalis. Gates revealed that Connick’s ancestors waged naval warfare against the British during the Revolutionary War.  On the other hand, Marsalis’ ancestors included an interracial couple during the mid-1800s—a statistical rarity.
Gates said that he wanted to make sure to gather an impressive group of guests, stating that he wanted, “people [he admired] or wanted to meet, of different ethnicities as a cross-section of America.”
Gates’ latest venture differs from his earlier works in its scope, format, and focus on the complexity of individual identity. Gates is scheduled to produce 10 episodes of “Finding Your Roots,” making it more than twice the length of his earlier series.
Gates said that his focus on genealogy reflects a passion he has had since his youth. As a child, Gates said that he would ask his parents about their experiences and history in order to build a family tree.
With today’s advanced technology in genetic testing, he is now able to take his passion further, exploring genealogies in “new and exciting ways.”

Professor Bradley S. Epps, director of undergraduate studies in romance studies and director of graduate studies in women, gender, and sexuality, will leave Harvard next year to chair the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at Cambridge University starting in 2013.
Epps said that he was elated to be elected to the position.
“It is a very respected chair, arguably one of the most in Hispanism, my discipline,” he said.
He cited his academic passion for Spanish as the primary reason for his forthcoming departure and said that after 21 years of teaching at Harvard, “it’s a good time for me to face new challenges.”
Epps, who formerly chaired the WGS department, teaches classes in the disciplines of both romance studies and WGS, but will focus more closely on Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan at Cambridge.
“I will indeed be going back to my first love, my base, which is Spanish literature and culture,” he said.
Susan R. Suleiman, acting chair of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, said that she “feel[s] extremely sad that he’s leaving us but full of congratulations and pleasure that he got this prestigious position.”
According to Suleiman, Epps is a “charismatic teacher” who was “singlehandedly” responsible for bringing Catalan to greater prominence in the department. In addition, Epps spearheaded the creation of the romance studies concentration track, where students can combine studies in two or three romance languages. His academic interests include 19th and 20th century Spanish and Latin American language, culture, and urban studies, and recently, he has conducted substantial research on Spanish cinema and visual arts.
“He has been an outstanding citizen of the department,” Suleiman said, calling Epps a “prolific scholar.”
Although he said he is excited to be a short plane ride away from Spain, Epps said he will miss the close interactions he had with students at Harvard.
“I love my students, my undergraduates and my graduates,“ Epps said.
Itziar Rodriguez de Rivera, who has taken several classes, including an independent study, with Epps and is currently one of his dissertation advisees, said that Epps is “very approachable” and “very enthusiastic.”
“He puts a lot of passion into his work,” she said.

Advising Fortnight began on Monday night with a kickoff event in Annenberg Hall. As freshmen sampled finger food and pamphlets filled with concentration requirements, representatives from every academic department at Harvard engaged them in conversations regarding their future studies.
“For the freshmen, this is one-stop shopping,” said William J. Anderson, a human developmental and regenerative biology adviser. “It’s very easy for them to ask a particular question and move onto the next department.”
Over the next two weeks, freshmen will have many opportunities to attend more focused events geared toward helping them choose a concentration next year.
Anderson said that freshmen who have interests in fields without much overlap would be best served by the kickoff event. However, freshmen who were choosing between several closely related concentrations also said they found the concentration fair helpful.
“It’s tough for students who are into social studies or history because they’re so interconnected,” Andrew D. Talbot ’15 said. “Events like this are good to get a better sense of the concentration.”
Freshmen who were set on a concentration had mixed reactions.
“I probably can’t get as much out of this event as most people because I’m already pretty decided,” said Marina Molarsky-Beck ’15, a  Crimson magazine comper. She said that she plans to concentrate in history of art and architecture.
But other freshmen who consider themselves mostly decided found a use for the event.
“I’m using this event to explore my secondary options because I don’t know very much about requirements for that,” said Andrew S. Flesher ’15, who has set his sights on a primary concentration in economics.
The event’s large size may have worked to the advantage of small concentrations. Representatives from these departments said that this event gave them a chance to better explain their disciplines to freshmen who otherwise might not seek them out.
“Many seniors come to me and say they wish they had known about hist and sci,” said Alice J. Belser, manager of student programs for the Department of History and Science.
The talks that students had with faculty members at the event did not count to satisfy the required advising conversation that each freshman must document on the Advising Network Portal.
“This is meant to start the conversation,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “There are opportunities throughout the week to meet with people in less frenetic settings.”
Deborah D. Foster, head tutor for folklore and mythology and director of undergraduate studies for special concentrations, said that such crucial conversations could not be had in the busy atmosphere of Annenberg.
“I think it’s good for students to actually talk to someone in the department to see what it’s about,” Foster said. “Without that kind of exchange, you’re not going to get the full range of what’s possible.”

Although Harvard Law School student Matthew P. Gelfand knew he wanted to attend law school before graduating from Brown University in 2008, he did not know he wanted to be president of the Law School’s student body until Friday, March 2—five days before the election. His platform: to eviscerate and rewrite the current student government constitution, and then resign.
On Wednesday, March 7, Gelfand—who is in his third year and set to graduate in May—won an election that had been mired in controversy and gained national publicity. Less than a week after the election, he emerged victorious in a fight against four last-minute proposed amendments that would have hindered his ability to implement his vision. An opinion piece in The Record, the Law School’s student newspaper, called this last ditch effort “the Student Government equivalent of the Midnight Judges Scandal.”
On April 1 Gelfand will assume office and take on the ambitious project of overhauling the student government and rewriting its foundational documents in their entirety for the first time since its creation.
“WIN. FIX. RESIGN.”
Spending most of his time outside of class as managing editor of the Journal of Law and Technology for the past two years and as a board member for the Harvard Law Entrepreneurship Project, Gelfand said he only considered the presidency after hearing from friends in student government that it was spending an “inordinate” amount of time amending its own constitution and bylaws.
When Gelfand looked at the constitution, he found that not only did it permit such internal editing and restructuring without student input, but also that it did not require that student government meetings be made open to the student body or release their minutes.
“People should not be allowed to hide behind some kind of weird privilege and not take ownership about what they say in student government meetings, which is sort of [a] no brainer for me,” Gelfand said.
Gelfand said he decided to declare his candidacy with the intention of rewriting the constitution to address structural and transparency concerns.
During the four days permitted for campaigning, Gelfand told students that he would rewrite the constitution and have it ratified by the student body before he and his appointed board would resign in time for commencement this May.
Gelfand spread the word about his platform through postering, tabling in Harkness Commons, and a Facebook page bearing his campaign slogan: “Win. Fix. Resign.”
He said that never expected to win, but hoped that his campaign would draw attention to the issues publicized in his candidate statement.
CAMPAIGN CONTROVERSY
Gelfand’s unexpected victory was the result of a bizarre string of events that included alleged racism, emergency meetings with the Dean of Students, and the involvement of gossip blog Above the Law.
The two other candidates for president—student government representative Daniel B. Vargas, and current vice president Rachna Shah—became embroiled in a heated exchange after Vargas condemned a bylaw passed during Shah’s tenure as vice president that made it more difficult to form groups based on a national, regional, or state identity.
Shah responded to Vargas’s criticism with a 1,600-word letter to her 79 sectionmates that she asked them to distribute widely among the Law School student body. Her letter stated that Vargas’s claims were false and that he misrepresented her when he called her “discriminatory” and “racist.” Vargas claimed that he never used the word “racist.”
When Above the Law—a website that publishes news and drama in the legal world—caught wind of the controversy, it published and mocked Shah’s letter, calling her “’Joanne Galloway’ (after the character from A Few Good Men who is a total drag).” The blog also introduced Gelfand as “The Joker” and predicted that everyone who agreed that Vargas and Shah had acted “like little babies” would vote for Gelfand.
To prove it, they administered a poll. Gelfand received 90 percent of the 1,162 votes.
“It of course cannot be denied that I was helped by what happened between the other campaigns,” Gelfand said. “As that stuff sort of developed, I realized that my chances might be considerably higher.”
As the campaign spun out of control, Vargas and Shah attended several emergency meetings with Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove, including one the night before the election to discuss postponing voting.
Gelfand sent an email to the Dean stating that the campaign had stressed the student body enough and that the election should go forward. She agreed.
The election took place the following day, and Gelfand won.
“THE MIDNIGHT JUDGES SCANDAL”
After the election some members of student government did not welcome Gelfand with open arms.
A week after the election, a series of last-minute amendments were proposed that would significantly impede Gelfand’s ability to enact his reforms.
For example, one amendment would have given current officers—including the Vice President Shah—a continued role after the official turnover on April 1.
Another amendment would have allowed students to attend meetings, but forbid them from speaking or participating in any way.
In an email to The Crimson, Shah wrote that the amendments had been “meant to allow for the transfer of institutional memory and aid in the transition process.”
A note written next to a provision giving the outgoing president and vice president a role reads “expire Commencement 2012?,” implying that the policy was crafted to apply specifically to Gelfand’s presidency.
“There is no way for me to read that amendment as not being motivated by at least somebody backing it with an interest in retaining power for themselves to prevent me from doing what I wanted to do,” Gelfand said.
Shah was listed as first signatory of the proposed amendments, followed by a list of nine other representatives of student government.
Gelfand publicized the proposed amendments on his Facebook page and inspired about 10 people—“Ten times the number of people who have ever attended [a student government meeting],” Gelfand said—to protest the amendments with him and his running mate, second year law student Jordan B. Roberts, at the meeting the following day.
All amendments were voted down.
Following the meeting Shah told Gefand that there were no vindictive motivations behind the amendments.
“Upon discussion in the student government meeting, however, it became clear (and I agree) that there are better ways to deal with transition outside of the constitutional realm, particularly given that Matt Gelfand intends to rephrase the Constitution anyway,” Shah wrote in an email. “Student government is glad that this important concern could be resolved through open conversation with incoming leadership.”
LOOKING FORWARD
Though Gelfand’s presidency does not officially begin until April 1, he said that he is already laying the groundwork for a new constitution.
Gelfand said that next week he plans to send a survey to the student body to gauge student opinion about potential changes to the constitution and will likely publish the results, depending on the amount of feedback he receives.
Gelfand will also solicit applications from students who wish to serve on his board of directors, with the condition that they will resign when Gelfand does.
In the next four to six weeks, Gelfand said he will roll out a draft of the constitution so that it can be voted on by student government and then ratified by the student body before commencement. The student body never ratified the current constitution.
Though Gelfand plans to resign by commencement, he said that he would remain in the role after graduation—which is permitted by the current constitution—if the new constitution is not in place by May.
Gelfand was awarded a fellowship to work in the general counsel’s office of New York University next year. After, Gelfand said he plans to work as an in-house legal counsel for a non-profit, or on the business side of a non-profit charter school that may be launched by one of his close friends.
Gelfand said he hopes that in the future student government will be less dependent on the Dean of Students office, since its current close ties prevent student government officials from challenging the administration.
Administrators have expressed support for a fully independent student government, according to Gelfand.
In addition, he said that he would like to support the many student groups and student journals on campus that were fostered by former Dean of the Law School and now-Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.
“I am so glad I am at Harvard Law, rather than a place, even like some of our very close peer schools, where you can’t really participate on the journals as a 1L, and where there’s not a whole lot outside of class to do,” Gelfand said. “I am eternally grateful that that was not my experience and I think that most important of all is making sure that continues.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Sept. 23
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Rachna Shah, who ran for president of the Harvard Law School student government, sent an email during her campaign to the entire student body. In fact, she sent that email to her 79 sectionmates and asked them to forward it widely. In addition, the article incorrectly stated that Shah called meetings with Law School Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove during the campaign. In fact, though she attended meetings, she did not request them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although Harvard College saw 1.9 percent fewer applications this year, the acceptance rate looks likely to decrease nevertheless. Since the admissions office plans to count on a yes from the vast majority of students accepted through its renewed early action program, Harvard may admit as few as 3 percent of the students waiting to hear their decisions this Thursday.
Overall, Harvard might admit about 5.5 percent of students who applied under early action and regular decision to the Class of 2016—a drop from last year’s record-low 6.2 percent.
If the admission rate does fall this year despite the slightly reduced applicant pool, it will be due to a new calculus in the admissions office centered on predicting the number of students accepted in the early round who will choose to come to Harvard.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that those who were accepted in December under the early action program will be more likely to matriculate. “In the past, the yield for early admission students has been higher than the yield for people applying regular admissions—in fact, 15 to 20 points higher typically,” Fitzsimmons said.
Last year, 77 percent of students accepted—all regular decision, before the return of the early action program—decided to come to Cambridge. If early admits choose Crimson at the rate Fitzsimmons predicted, then as many as 92 to 97 percent of them might matriculate.
Fitzsimmons said he speculates that early action applicants may have a stronger interest in attending Harvard, thus leading to the higher yield rate for those students.
Bev Taylor, founder of college consulting practice The Ivy Coach, said the students she advises typically attend Harvard if they are admitted early. “When they apply early action to Harvard, yes, they go to Harvard,” she said.
Expecting these eager admits, Fitzsimmons said that his office will be conservative in the number of students it admits this year to avoid overcrowding.
Though Harvard has not yet announced the number of acceptance letters that will go in the mail on Thursday, the College will look to roughly replicate the size of this year’s freshman class—1,661.
Already, 772 acceptance letters for the Class of 2016 went out in December.
From this point, anyone with a pencil and paper can approximate the math going on in the admissions office. To be safe, assume that the admissions office, behaving cautiously, makes room for every student who has been accepted early to attend. That leaves about 900 freshman beds open to regular decision candidates. If the yield for that cycle is high as well—say 80 percent—Harvard can admit just over 1,100 more students on Thursday to count on 900 of them showing up.
In total, that means that about 1,900 acceptance letters will go out this year, plus perhaps more to waitlisted students after the first crop of accepted students make their decisions by May 1. Last year, Harvard initially accepted 2,158.
If the number of admitted students is indeed this small, the overall acceptance rate for the 34,285 students who sought admission this year would be 5.5 percent. But that number, already tiny, belies the even smaller odds that an applicant who is waiting for his decision on Thursday hears good news.
The 772 students who were selected in December were picked from a pool of 4,245, leading to an acceptance rate of 18 percent.
This time, 32,967—all regular applicants plus early candidates deferred to the regular round—are competing for just about 1,100 spots. In the regular cycle, a student’s chance of acceptance would be 3 percent based on these calculations.
That these numbers are so small is due to the renewed early action program. “I really believe that would tax on the overall acceptance rate,” Taylor said of early admissions.
But despite the daunting figures, Don McMillan, president of an educational consulting firm in Boston, predicted that students will keep applying to Harvard in similar numbers.
And that means the acceptance rate will not climb much higher. Michael Goran, director of IvySelect College Consulting, said, “There’s still a finite number of seats in a class and there’s a limitation to how much you can expand.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Councillors along with Salvadoran officials commemorated the 25-year anniversary of the Cambridge-El Salvador Sister City Project on Wednesday.
The event inspired State Representative Alice K. Wolf to attend the Council meeting.
“It was very moving to hear over the years the humanitarian and political results of having had this relationship,” said Wolf, who spoke at the end of ceremony prior to the meeting’s official start.
Wolf served on the Council when Cambridge established a relationship with San Jose Las Flores.
The Council passed a resolution for a series of commemorative  events to be held throughout the year.
“I think this is a two-way learning relationship. We are pleased and grateful that you let us learn about your city,” said Vice Consul of the Consulate General of El Salvador Ena U. Pena.
After Salvadoran representatives filed out of the chamber, five residents spoke out against the process of the fast food zoning variance for a Dunkin Donuts to be established at 1678 Mass Ave.
Residents argued that the Board of Zoning Appeal’s public notice was inaccurate. The public notice, which was posted at 1678 Mass Ave., referred to the business as a “café/coffee shop.”
“I’m mostly bothered by the lack of appropriate process,” said Gordon Moore, a Cambridge resident who said that Dunkin Donuts is not a café. “They should redo the process and announce exactly what it is—a coffee shop that sells donuts and light sandwiches.”
Moore added that he does not oppose Dunkin Donuts categorically and is a frequent customer of the fast food chain.
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. has requested that the Board of Zoning Appeal redo the variance process by the order of the city manager.
The Council voted unanimously with one absence to allot $25,000 to help pay for the cost of participating in the 2012 Biotechnology Industry Organization International Convention. The Convention will take place at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center from June 18 to 21.
City Manager Robert W. Healy said the full participation cost will be discussed at the next economic development meeting.
Councillors discussed several applications for the posting of signs, three of which will be erected in Harvard Square.
Pinkberry requested permission to add another sign to its Mass Ave. store front. Curious George, which has planned a reopening for April 28, requested permission for two signs.
Propark Inc. requested three sandwich board signs.
The orders were all passed by the Council.
Councillors concluded the meeting by thanking Wolf for her many years of service.
“She will certainly be missed, and I’m sure she’s going to be around in many different facets,” said Toomey. “I’m looking forward to continuing our relationship.”
City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, who announced her candidacy soon after Wolf declared that she would not seek reelection, reminded councillors that Wolf is not yet out of office.
“She is here for another good year as our state rep. It is time to reflect her time as being a changemaker and an activist,” Decker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students are largely dissatisfied with hook-up culture, Dr. Lisa Wade revealed on Monday at “Sex Lives and Sex Lies: Hooking Up on Campus.”
The event, one of the many comprising Harvard’s first annual Sex Week, was sponsored by Sexual Health Education & Advocacy Throughout Harvard College and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Wade, an assistant professor of sociology at Occidental College known for her popular website “Sociological Images,” presented a mass of statistics on the college hookup scene culled from her own studies. She complimented data with quotes from students about their experiences with casual sex and the intense cultural pressure surrounding it.
Wade repeatedly called for the opening up of restrictive hook-up culture to alternative viewpoints on sex. Wade—who did not condemn the hook up in itself—said that while hook ups are prevalent on college campuses, the majority of people engaged in hook-up culture are “deeply dissatisfied” with their experiences.
“The three things students were looking for in hook ups were pleasure, connection, and empowerment,” Wade said. “Just one of those would have been enough.”
Hook-up culture, Wade said, rarely realizes any of these goals and leaves students disappointed because of their hopes for emotional connections.
“Hookup culture insists that you must enjoy casual sex and have an active disinterest in your partner,” Wade said. “It must be careless.”
Wade said that hook-up culture exemplifies “pluralistic ignorance,” which occurs when the majority of the population fails to realize the truth of a situation. In this context, Wade said, pluralistic ignorance insists that everyone is satisfied by hook ups when they actually fail to meet many of their most basic desires.
Wade also noted that hook-up culture is “rabidly heterocentric” and marginalizes non-heterosexual sexual orientations.
Wade’s presentation drew a large crowd of students from the College as well as graduate students from across the University and underclassmen from other schools.
Matilda G. Sokolov ’14, a long time fan of Wade, said that “hearing these ideas in this open form is what really gets people talking, and changes the conversation.”
Alessandro M. La Porta ’09 echoed Sokolov’s sentiment. “In every big sex talk I’ve ever had, communication is always the core element,” La Puerta said. “But in hookup culture, communication is usually thrown out the window.”
At the end of her talk, Wade offered students a solution to hook-up culture dissatisfaction.
“You are Harvard’s sex culture. Just you. No one else owns it,” Wade said. “Challenge hookup culture out loud, and in doing so disrupt the pluralistic ignorance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When outgoing Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson came to Harvard in 2005, she brought with her almost two decades of administrative experience overseeing student life and Greek organizations.
Immediately before taking her post at Harvard, Nelson had spent the past seven years at Cornell University, where she managed 3,500 students in 67 Greek organizations as associate dean of students for fraternity and sorority affairs.
At Cornell, Nelson—who had been a member of Kappa Alpha Theta in college herself—launched the “Creating Chapters of Excellence” initiative, which increased administrative oversight over Greek organizations through mentorship, programming, and financial resources.
Nelson brought her administrative hand to Harvard, where she increased dialogue with student organizations as head of the Office of Student Life after its creation in 2009.
Now, after six-and-a-half years at Harvard, Nelson will be moving on once again in June to become vice president and dean of the college at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y.
Nelson’s departure comes at a pivotal moment in the evolution of the OSL, which is closely involved in the first stage of the House Renewal project, the launch of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the crafting of a new alcohol policy expected to be drafted by the end of this semester.
In the midst of these developments which will come to fruition without the guidance of the dean who helped launch them, reviews of Nelson’s tenure at Harvard are mixed. While administrators and student leaders universally praised Nelson for striving to involve students in the OSL’s decision-making process, some said they thought Nelson was perceived by undergraduates as overbearingly involved in student organization governance—or conversely, not known to many students at all.
EAR TO THE GROUND
When Nelson came to Harvard in 2005, she wrote in an email to The Crimson that she would seek to “actively engage students in shaping their campus experience and to provide them with support and guidance” in her new position as dean of residential life.
Administrators and student leaders said they thought Nelson succeeded in these goal as dean of residential life and, later, as Harvard’s first dean of student life.
Former Undergraduate Council President Senan Ebrahim ’12 lauded Nelson for fostering “a much more accessible, student-friendly approach, with more incorporation of the student perspective” through initiatives like meetings to solicit student feedback on alcohol policy. He also praised her involvement in the Task Force on Student Voice, which brought together a group of students, staff, and faculty to examine students’ input in Harvard policy.
Assistant Dean of the College for Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña wrote in an email that she thought Nelson “helped enhance an environment that really supported student development and engagement.”
But Ebrahim admitted that Nelson’s efforts to listen to students’ voices may have sometimes gone unnoticed by the student body.
“I’m not sure to what extent students around the College know all she’s done for us,” Ebrahim said.
WITH A STRONG HAND
Faced with issues like underage drinking and off-campus partying which frequently bring students and administrators into conflict, Nelson has served as a mediating figure in the fray.
Each semester, she has held training meetings for the new officers of unrecognized student organizations—fraternities, sororities, and final clubs—to discuss hazing, safe parties, and sexual violence.
“I didn’t get the impression that she was an opponent of the final club system,” said Eddie S. Alfred ’13, president of the Delphic final club.
But Alfred said that Nelson’s meetings with Delphic members after past incidents at the Club—including police complaints about alcohol or noise—led some Delphic members to question Nelson’s interference.
“The fact that we had to have these meetings led to the perception that she was being heavy-handed when, in fact, she was being diligent and involved,” Alfred said.
Former president of the College Democrats Jonathan L. Newmark ’12 said that while he thought the OSL’s oversight increased during his time as a member of the Dems, he never felt policed.
“We grew to be more dependent on the Office of Student Life in a positive and beneficial way,” Newmark said.
TURNING A BLIND EYE?
As fraternity and sorority membership surges on campus, Greek leaders have clamored for recognition from the administration.
Phillip Morris ’12, former president of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said that he had the impression that Nelson would have recognized Greek organizations at Harvard if she had the power.
“I’m confident that if the decision were solely hers, Greeks would be recognized,” Morris said. “But unfortunately things take a long time at Harvard.”
For her part, Nelson wrote in an email that although she has “a good understanding of the positive—and negative—aspects of hosting a Greek system on a campus...Harvard has chosen not to recognize fraternities and sororities because of our specific residential model.”
It is a model she has come to know well in the past six-and-a-half years. “I will miss many things about Harvard, including my many friends and colleagues and the tremendously talented Harvard students with whom I’ve been fortunate to work,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since fall 2011, North Allston has witnessed a spate of businesses open in Harvard-owned properties lining Western Ave.—many of which had sat vacant for more than a year. Harvard’s new tenants say that they have found an advantageous and profitable home in the Allston community and an exemplary landlord in the University.
Stone Hearth Pizza Company owner Jonathan Schwarz, whose restaurant opened last November, praised the Allston community for its “overwhelming” support of his business.
“The locals have been really amazing and supportive,” Schwarz said. “Without their enormous generosity, we would not be faring anywhere near as well as we are now.”
Schwarz praised the prominent Western Ave. location of the newest outpost of his small restaurant chain.
“Harvard leased us this really visible space, and that’s been really important,” Schwarz said. “People can see the restaurant when they’re driving or walking by. It makes a huge difference.”
Gregory Salvucci, whose company, Signal Graphics, opened earlier this year, echoed Schwarz’s sentiments on the importance of community support and a conspicuous spot for attracting new business in the area.
“Some of the local companies have been really great about getting involved,” said Salvucci, who has done work for Harvard Business School, the Graduate School of Education, and the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team. “And I have people who live close by who also come in. I think that good visibility to the traffic flow on the street is responsible for that.”
Harvard’s original master plan for development on its Allston lands, released in 2007, included the creation of a vibrant “main street” on Western Ave. in addition to the construction of a $1 billion Science Complex. When the University halted construction on the Science Complex in 2009 due to financial trouble, many Harvard-owned properties on Western Ave. were left empty.
In Dec. 2009, University President Drew G. Faust voiced the University’s new focus on “aggressive and effective leasing of vacant or partially vacant Harvard properties” in Allston. At the time, 65 percent of Harvard’s leasable holdings were occupied.
Since then, the University has signed 19 leases—increasing its occupancy rate to 92 percent. The first months of 2012 alone have seen five new businesses open in Harvard’s holdings in Allston.
The new businesses that have filled those spaces applauded Harvard as a landlord.
“Harvard has been incredibly helpful and supportive as a landlord,” said Ed LaVache, who runs Boston Boxing & Fitness. “We’ve had a great relationship, and I think that’s been really important for the club.”
Djelassi said she appreciates Harvard’s security personnel circulating near her business, a benefit she might not receive from a smaller landlord.
“Because Harvard is such a big corporation, they are able to offer much more security,” she said. “I really feel safer than I did at my old location.”

The Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents many of Harvard’s library workers, began meeting with Library management on Wednesday and Thursday of last week in three Joint Councils.
In the wake of Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton’s Jan. 19 announcement that the library’s reorganization would include staff reductions, the Joint Councils were announced in late February to facilitate communication between the library and the union, HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said at the time.
In a letter sent to HUCTW members early last week, HUCTW leaders announced the specific members who would comprise the union teams for each of the three joint councils. Each team was made up of five to seven union members. According to the letter, one union team was formed for each of the Joint Councils: Access Services; Technical Services; and Preservation, Conservation, and Digital Imaging.
The letter to union members noted that before any worker is laid off, the University must undergo a “process of consultation” with the union, and that these Joint Councils do not take the place of that process.
“It is our hope that through this Joint Council process, we can prevent a need for those [layoff] conversations,” the letter said.
Although Jaeger, a member of one of the union teams, declined to comment on the specific topics discussed at the first Joint Council meetings, he said that he thought they were “a serious, energetic exchange.”
“It was a way better tone on all sides than in some of the public forums back in January and February,” Jaeger said.
“I think it’s important for staff to have a hands-on experience to be part of that thinking and planning.”
A University spokesperson called the first Joint Council sessions “positive and productive” in an email statement.
In addition to representatives from the Harvard Library and HUCTW, each Joint Council included officials from Harvard’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations, according to the spokesperson.
“The Library is committed to participating in a constructive dialogue with...HUCTW over the next several months,” the spokesperson wrote.
Susan D. Radovsky, a library assistant who was a member of the Technical Services Joint Council, wrote in an email that she was hopeful that the Joint Councils would lead to a more open discussion.
“Our hope is that this engagement will produce an atmosphere of transparency about strategic goals and plans that will lead to greater staff involvement in the shaping of the new Harvard Library,” Radovsky wrote in the email.
Though Jaeger said that he is optimistic after the first sessions, he said that it would likely be “some weeks or months” before the Councils make concrete progress. Groups will continue to meet every two or three weeks for at least several months.
“There’s a lot more talking to be done,” Jaeger said. “For our union, it’s a hugely important goal that we protect jobs and the kind of staffing levels we need to have a great library, but it’s clear already that these Joint Councils are going to be about a lot more than that.”

One win away from receiving a bid to the NCAA Fencing Championship game, co-captain sabre Valentin Staller calmly stared down his opponent, No. 1 Max Stearns of Ohio State, and defeated him 15-13 for the upset victory.
Staller has had an illustrious career with the Crimson. He has been the calm, composed leader of a Harvard team that finished sixth at the NCAA Fencing Championships and second at the Ivy League Championships this season.
“He is very disciplined with his training,” said freshman epee Peregrine Badger. “He makes sure we are always working hard.”
Saber events are different from epee  and foil events in that points can be scored with touches from the top and side of the blade to any target from the waist-up, excluding both hands.
The Old Field, N.Y. native started fencing when he was in middle school.
“On Long Island, there happens to be a high school league,” Staller said. “When I was in middle school I just decided to try out for the team. I made the team and then I got really into it. I got pretty competitive and I started going to national tournaments, and then I ended up here.”
With each passing year, Staller’s fencing accolades have only increased. As a freshman, he placed 15th at the NCAA Championships and as a sophomore, he placed ninth. At the Ivy League Championships during his freshman and sophomore years, Staller was chosen as a first team All-Ivy saber.
Last year, as a junior, Staller received All-American honors and All-Ivy second team honors. He finished ninth individually at the NCAA Fencing Championships and helped the Crimson to a fourth-place tie with Ohio State. This year, he was chosen as a first team All-Ivy player, finishing sixth in the saber field at the NCAA Northeast Regional event at Boston College. Staller was also featured in CollegeFencing360 as a “Primetime Performer.”
His sophomore teammate Lucas Lin attributes much of Staller’s success to his composure and unflappable personality.
“I think his success is largely a part of his mental game,” Lin said. “His ability to stay focused under pressure is a huge part of what the college game is about.”
Staller says that this season he has learned to better control his emotions on the strip.
“The nature of the sport can be pretty mentally draining,” Staller said. “It can be pretty stressful. When you are fencing for a team, you are really putting the team on your back. I’ve been working on just staying cool, keeping a clear head, and sticking with my decisions.”
Although Staller has been highly competitive throughout his time fencing sabre at Harvard, the biggest match of his fencing career was against No. 2 seed Aleksander Ochocki of Penn State in the championship bout of the NCAA tournament.
Staller would finish in second place individually in the men’s saber championship, falling to Ochocki, 15-11.
“It was a tough matchup for me,” Staller said. “I thought that I had a game plan that I could beat him with, but he kept willing himself that extra half inch.”
While Staller wasn’t able to claim the individual title in saber, his teammates insist that the senior sabre put forth a valiant effort.
“I think the [NCAA] Championships are the most competitive event of college fencing,” Badger said. “Our expectations are always down to earth. You have to put it all into perspective. Valentin coming in second was really incredible. You have to remember that [we] are playing some of the best people in the country, and in some cases some of the best people in the world.”
Staller hopes to continue fencing after graduation at the international level and is currently training to attend the USA National Championships in April.
“Overall, this tournament was rather bittersweet for me. I’m really sad that my fencing career here at Harvard has come to a close,” Staller said. “I’ve definitely had my ups and downs, but I was really happy to have finished my career with my strongest result. Fencing has definitely been one of the best parts of my Harvard experience, and I cannot imagine what my time here would have been like without it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 17 Harvard sailing team had all hands on deck this weekend and came away from its three regattas with three top-ten finishes. This marks the first consistent, across the board performance from the sailing teams in the spring season.
BOSTON DINGHY CLUB CHALLENGE CUP
The 83rd Annual Boston Dinghy Challenge Cup, college sailing’s oldest trophy race, is a highly competitive three-division regatta hosted by No.18 MIT.
The Cup combined a wide variety of boats, including the Engineer’s FJs and fireflies and the Crimson’s FJs, which allowed for 18 races in every division. This regatta debuted MIT’s new docks and new fleet of unique firefly boats, both of which received positive reviews.
“Fireflies are sailed primarily by the British team racer and MIT is the first American college to have a fleet of fireflies and sail them in a regatta–It was a very unique event,” senior Alexandra Jumper said. “We had the chance to practice in them for a couple hours on Friday afternoon, but it’s a pretty steep learning curve.”
In addition to the difficulty of adjusting to new boats, the Charles River did Harvard few favors.
Winds started between six and eight knots from the east on Saturday morning and tapered throughout the day. Sunday, breezes stayed between five to eight knots from the east-northeast.
“The conditions were pretty shifty and fairly light throughout the weekend,” Jumper said. “It was a fairly competitive event and the conditions were fairly challenging.”
The Crimson finished in 10th place of 18 teams. The A and B divisions came in only one point apart at 134 and 135 points, finishing fourth and sixth respectively, and the C division finished with 181 points leaving Harvard with 460 points.
“I think that all of us that went in this weekend came out with lessons learned. During every race we would learn something, and the next race we would go back and apply it,” freshman skipper Michael Drumm said. “It was a learning experience.”
OWEN, MOSBACHER AND KNAPP TROPHIES
The Owen, Mosbacher and Knapp Trophies two-conference regatta combines three coveted awards and triples the stakes, especially for the Crimson and its Ivy League brethren.
The Mosbacher and Knapp trophies have special relevance to members of the Ancient Eight. Sailing does not hold an official Ivy League Championship and so the Mosbacher trophy acts as a rough equivalent. Independent of that, the Knapp trophy goes to the winner between Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
The Crimson won the Owen, Mosbacher and Knapp trophies in 2011 with rival Yale, now ranked No. 1 in the country, coming in second. But this year the Bulldogs hosted the regatta right in their backyard at the Branford, Conn. McNay Family Sailing Center. Sailing at its home course, Yale took the titles back from the Crimson. The Bulldogs breezed past all other competition, coming in 25 points ahead of the field.
The races began on a gusty Saturday, with between 10 to 15 knots from the east. The first sets of the A and B division faced waves, but by the final B division race the wind settled to five knots.
The teams expected a blustery Sunday, but despite the forecast, Sunday brought less wind than Saturday and the regatta completed with a wavering five to 10 knots out of the east-northeast.
Harvard finished in sixth place out of 15 teams. The A and B divisions, both composed solely of underclassmen, pulled their weight, coming in with 83 and 82 points, respectively.
Despite the disappointing finish, the young Crimson learned a lot for the future.
“Our coach was out in the water with us in a motor boat and after every race he gave a lot of constructive feedback,” Drumm said. “He helped us figure out and improve on what was going on in the water.”
BOSTON UNIVERSITY BRIDGE INVITE
Not far from home, another group of Harvard sailors competed at the Boston University Bridge Regatta.
Saturday, the winds blew east-southeast at a gentle three to seven knots. And although the wind ramped up slightly, the wind conditions Sunday were similarly mild.
The A boat of sophomores Caitlin Watson and Jacquelyn Cooley came in ninth with 106 points. The B boat of sophomore skipper Ames Lyman, junior crew Nicholas Gordon and freshman crew Rebecca Frankel also managed a ninth-place finish, giving the co-ed team a combined 206 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday night, the Crimson men’s lacrosse team wants to mess with perfection.
Harvard (4-3, 2-0 Ivy) travels to Amherst to face the undefeated No. 3 University of Massachusetts (7-0, 1-0 CAA) under the lights at Richard F. Garber field at 7 p.m.
Following a 2-0 start in the Ivy League, the Crimson returns to non-conference play for the latest installment of this intrastate rivalry game. Harvard has won the past two years, but trails the Minutemen in the all-time series by 16 games.
On March 17, UMass notched its third straight one-point victory, a 9-8 overtime win on the road against Penn State to stay unbeaten. It has not played since, giving the Minutemen  ten days’ of rest and preparation.
Meanwhile, Harvard is preparing for a quick turnaround after defeating Dartmouth, 15-10, at home on Saturday. To ready itself for the playing conditions on UMass’ synthetic turf field, the Crimson has been practicing on Jordan Field, the home of Harvard field hockey.
When it hasn’t been adjusting to the speed of synthetic turf, the Crimson has been studying film of its opponent—with eyes on one athlete in particular: Minutemen junior attackman Will Manny.
Manny ranks third in the nation in points per game and leads his conference in points, goals, and game-winning goals. His performance this season has landed him a spot on the Tewaaraton Foundation’s watch list for the Tewaaraton Award, given annually to the nation’s best college lacrosse player.
“He’s really quick and a special offensive guy,” said freshman goalie Jake Gambitsy of Manny.  “We’re going to do our best to contain him and make them work as a team on offense, so it’s not just him showcasing his abilities.”
While the Harvard defenders prepare for Manny, their UMass counterparts are certainly well aware of the Crimson’s own high-powered offensive weapon: senior attackman Jeff Cohen.
Cohen, the reigning Ivy League co-player of the week, has scored five goals in three straight games and is tied for second in the nation in goals per game. Harvard’s fourth all-time leading scorer is a familiar foe to the Minutemen, netting three goals in last year’s matchup with UMass, two his sophomore year and one as a freshman.
Cohen leads a Crimson offense that has posted double-digit points in all but one of its games and is coming off a season-high 15 goals on Saturday.
“[Freshman midfielder] Keegan Michel is winning faceoffs in bunches and allowing us to have fast breaks, [sophomore attackman] Danny Eipp is doing a phenomenal job behind the cage, and Jeff Cohen is shooting the ball as good as anyone in the country,” co-captain attackman Kevin Vaughan said. “It’s easy to score goals when those guys are playing well.”
If this season is any indication, though, that ease of scoring may not translate so smoothly against Minutemen senior goalie Tim McCormack. McCormack has held all opponents to single-digit scores this year and ranks fourth in the nation in save percentage.
McCormack anchors a solid Massachusetts team that, according to Harvard head coach Chris Wojcik ’96, has no conspicuous weakness.
“They’re very good everywhere,” Wojcik said. “They score, they play excellent defense, they’re strong in goal. There isn’t a particular area we’re looking to exploit. We’re going to have to play really well in every phase of the game to win.”
Last year, after his squad downed UMass, 11-9, Wojcik told The Crimson, “This game was all about bragging rights for being the best team in the state of Massachusetts.”
The claim to the top spot in Massachusetts may not be on the line against the undefeated Minutemen this year, but Harvard can certainly make an impactful statement on a national level with a win on Tuesday night.
“It could be a great win for us to knock off a top 5 team and improve our resume going into the second half of the season,” Vaughan said.
And for those who will be in Amherst, there is no doubt that the atmosphere will be charged with the competitive energy that has characterized each matchup between these two teams for the past 42 years.
“UMass is always one of my favorite games to play every year,” Vaughan said. “I’m pretty excited for the game. I’m sure they’ll have a rowdy crowd at their home turf. It’s a great in-state rivalry for us.”

Advising Fortnight began this evening with a kick-off event in Annenberg. The next two weeks promise a plethora of events catered to (and catered for) freshman eager for wisdom about concentrations (and cupcakes).
With pithy, often alliterative, food-oriented titles, the department workshops are aimed to help freshmen gauge their academic interests.
 Acknowledging the overstimulated and chronically indecisive nature of this generation, Flyby makes the concentration decision easy. Just go for the food.
If you like donuts, for instance, you might want head to the East Asian Studies "Donuts and Daoism" undergraduate open house on Tuesday, March 27 from 10 a.m-12 p.m. If you prefer dim sum, the department is also hosting an undergraduate dim sum party on Thursday, April 5 from 2-4 p.m.
On Wednesday, March 28, the Anthropology department will be serving up "hot munchies and cool cupcakes" in William James Hall from 6-8 p.m.
Don't miss out on monkeybread from the Physics department this Sunday, April 1, from 9-10 p.m. in the Leverett Masters' residence.
Those of you who really like pizza can enjoy pizza every day this week—up to three times a day, in fact—and pursue a special concentration in Literature-SEAS-Economics-Astrophysics-Applied Math-VES-and-Earth and Planetary Sciences.
The full schedule of events can be found here.

Harvard’s first annual Sex Week, now in full swing, drew a crowd of enthusiastic students to Science Center last night for "Hooking Up on Campus," a talk by sociologist and cultural critic Dr. Lisa Wade.
Wade, who is a Professor of Sociology at Occidental College in California, drew upon both her own research and previous studies to paint a grim picture of what she calls, "the cultural dominance of hooking up."
In her talk, Wade pointed out that she does not think college students are having too much sex. In fact, she said, our parents’ generation was actually more sexually active than ours is—a remark which elicited a flurry of groans from the audience.
Wade argued that today's culture of casual hook ups actually prevents many college students from having enjoyable sex. While some of the students Wade surveyed described casual sex as liberating, many others seemed to find it lacking. "They wanted to be not in love," Wade said, "but in like." However, she went on to explain, hook up culture can result in sex that is devoid of communication and compassion.
Wade's talk seemed to ring true with students, many of whom stuck around for a raffle of sex toys and t-shirts. "I was a little shocked by how what [Dr. Wade] said was very true of what I’ve experienced here," said  Bay B. McCulloch '12. "It was quite enlightening to hear that this inability to express emotions about sex is something other people are experiencing, too."

This week, there's a special reason to stop by the Cabot Science Library (and no, we don't mean to study.) It's the yearly Science Book Sale! The library is selling a variety of books from Harvard's collections at a low cost—in this case, just $4 a piece, or less.
Though most of the books are science related—with topics ranging from biology to the social sciences—there is a wide selection across disciplines. "We have an odd group, [including] about a shelf of popular histories of World War One battles," Allen Bourque, the library's Head of Collection Management and Circulation, wrote in an email.
Offering even more than just a wealth of scientific and historical information, the books on sale are useful for students who know which courses they will be taking in future semesters. "It's really a gold mine," said Rumbidzai C. Mushavi '12, a Cabot Science Library employee, as she gestured toward some brand new Statistics 100 books. "I highly suggest that students come and get their textbooks now."
While some of the books are duplicates or older versions of books that are currently available in the library system, visitors to the sale had many different reasons for loving what they discovered among the myriad of bound volumes.
"In some cases they'll be books that are directly related to our research, and in other cases they will be classic books that are just nice to have," said Noa E. Corcoran-Tadd, a graduate student in the Anthropology Department who purchased several books. "We're creating our own private library."
Revenue from the sale will be used to purchase new books for Harvard's collections. Administrators are also discussing donating any leftover funds to Better World Books, an organization to which Harvard libraries have sent books in the past.
The book sale is open through Thursday, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Be sure to stop by and get 'em while you can!

Mt. Auburn Street offers so much more than Boloco and final clubs. Tucked beside a parking lot, a large red brick building with the hanging sign "Harvard Square Shiatsu" goes unnoticed. However, this overlooked site is actually a historic gem. A bronze plaque immortalizes the building as the former home to one of the stranger trends in fashion. Welcome to the Reversible Collar Company Building.
What exactly is a reversible collar? According to a 1956 Crimson article, a reversible collar is made of paper and "attached to a neckband shirt, worn once, turned over, worn again, and then thrown away." Initially inspired by a shortage of cloth during the Civil War, the company, affectionately known as "The Reversible," was created by a Harvard alumnus in 1866. At the height of their business, the Reversible was producing about 3,000,000 items monthly. Though the trend gained popularity when it became a staple in the Navy Uniform, it was doomed to ultimately fall from fashion grace—think Crocs and knit ponchos.
The determined company persevered until they were the only surviving reversible collar factory. Shockingly, there was not much of a market for the collars in the late 20th century, and the company was forced to shut down. For those holding on to the trend, Amazon Drygoods Collars in Davenport, Iowa still produces paper collars, using the same machine from our very own Harvard Square Reversible Collar Company. They may be on to something. Fashion trends repeat themselves: boho skirts, flapper dresses, neon leggings. Why not the reversible collar?
