After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Christmas film is a tawdry form — glittery and overwrought, it asks its spectators to indulge in the largely secular, late capitalist spectacle of the holiday season, which has more to do with sugary maxims about gift-giving than the act of charity itself. Borne out of this genre is a veritable cadre of bauble-decked monstrosities that long to be enshrined in the glimmering vault of Christmas classics.
Still, all that glitters is not gold, as is unfortunately the case with Paul Feig’s heavily-marketed rom-com, “Last Christmas.” Starring a post-“Game of Thrones” Emilia Clarke and a post-“Crazy Rich Asians” Henry Golding, the film situates itself somewhere at the nexus of Hallmark holiday schmaltz and Paul Feigian black comedy, saccharine romantic comedy fare and posthumous George Michael publicity material. The result is, to borrow Henry James’ term for the novel, a “baggy monster.” Or perhaps more season-appropriately, a baggy Grinch with a shoddy heart — a muscle that “Last Christmas” only wishes it could borrow.
Katarina (Clarke), who prefers the anglicized moniker “Kate,” is a human trainwreck who spends her days stationed as a professional elf (yep!) in Yuletide, a year-round Christmas shop run by “Santa,” a severe taskmaster in the form of Michelle Yeoh. Poor Kate balances her day job and her aspirational evening auditions to become a West End singer, all the while fending off a nagging mother (a greying Emma Thompson with a hokey Slavic accent) and an uptight lawyer sister (Lydia Leonard). An itinerant Kate wanders idly from household to household, burning one bridge after another, until she meets Tom Webster (a dashing Henry Golding, who dials the charisma up to 11). Tom’s life is a crash course in goodwill, as he meanders on bicycle from volunteering at a homeless shelter to conducting therapy sessions. The ensuing romance between Kate and Tom is less an affair of the heart, and more a philosophy lesson that maneuvers Kate gradually from selfishness to altruism, plucked imperfectly from “The Good Place” and refitted for the holiday season.
As a feel-good, Christmas rom-com, “Last Christmas” delivers until it doesn’t. For two-thirds of the movie, Emma Thompson’s writing shines. The repartee between characters is exactly what a movie of this type calls for: Nearly anything can, and will, be played for laughs. Whether Kate is getting “pooed on” by a bird or her Yugoslavian mother is discovering new English slang (“But Dick is our neighbor! His name means penis?”), the punchlines land consistently. This movie is full of precisely the sort of banter that rom-coms are expected to have, and to Thompson’s credit, it nicely positions this movie in the sweet spot between hilariously entertaining and easily digestible.
Still, though the film’s cast speaks endearingly in Thompson’s signature energetic quips, decent screenwriting struggles to mask the awkwardness of occasional, fumbling gestures at societal critique — particularly when elsewhere, the film has yet to resolve its own complicated political leanings. The same film that overtly criticizes Brexit-era racism also repeatedly costumes Michelle Yeoh in pastel qipaos (as if Chinese women don’t own other clothing) and opportunistically employs a coming out storyline as a subplot without delving into its complexity. These oversights are admittedly minor and narratively insignificant, but for a film that stylizes itself as politically aware, the tonal inconsistencies and imbalances strike a strange chord.
Unfortunately, despite Thompson’s best attempts, politics aren’t the film’s only flaw. While Golding does a wonderful job portraying a charming romantic lead, certain moments exemplify how the movie’s emotional vocabulary feels over-articulated. In a scene meant to be emotional, during which Kate is lamenting life while Tom cradles her in his arms, Tom recites a number of overwrought statements, which leaves too little unspoken. “There’s no such thing as normal, it’s a stupid word,” he says, then continues, “Just being a human is really hard.” Sometimes, it’s the moment of silence that says it all.
But “Last Christmas” can’t stay silent. Much like last year’s campy “A Simple Favor,” also directed by Feig and starring Golding, the last-act plot twist of “Last Christmas” is enough to undermine even the best of Thompson’s abilities. The final 20 minutes descends into a chaos of too-neatly resolved problems, a festive charity talent show that puts every single character into the same room, and a far-too literal reading of the titular Wham! song. The ending recategorizes the movie in the catalog of films with gratuitous melodrama, instead of branding it a delightful holiday movie. Without spoiling the final twist, it’s safe to say that the final moments of the movie rob the film of any possible emotional resonance.
Emma Thompson said it herself: “This wonderful producer, David Livingston, said, ‘Do you want to write a screenplay, kind of a rom-com sort of thing, because we need a great new Christmas movie, based on ‘Last Christmas.’ And I said, ‘Not really.’” And she’s right, we did not need a holiday film that weaves George Michael’s discography and social values into a gimmicky plot. But in the end, that’s what’s left: a movie we grin and bear, with hopes of regifting. Surely by next Christmas, we’ll have given it away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to love the idea of history. For a long time when I was younger, the only thing I would watch on TV was the History Channel. No cartoons. Just programs with old dudes. (Some were probably Harvard professors?) It fascinated me. The crazy stories about rulers of old, invasions, wars, ancient people that lived what seemed completely different lives provided a fountain of realities that existed outside of my day to day life. In a way, the History Channel marketed some of its programs as if they were plots from a blockbuster movie. I loved it. I believed in those programs with my heart and soul.
Yet as I’ve grown older, I’ve developed an estranged relationship with history. It’s not that I don’t enjoy learning about other people, other cultures, civilizations, or accomplishments. It’s the fact that a lot of what has been told to me seems like a half-truth, or that the authenticity of the history I’ve learned, read about, or even witnessed through primary sources is so far away from the present that I automatically question if what I’m being told or telling myself is actually authentic. What’s the point of learning, analyzing or even discussing this gray area between what we think occurred and what we know has occurred? Can we ever get to the truth?
Now I know it seems very idealistic, and almost utopian to desire pure truth from every conversation I have, from every class I take, from every professor I talk to — people even lie sometimes. Many would say that higher education brings us closer to these truths. Harvard’s “Veritas” markets this very well. Yet what Harvard does not advertise is that perhaps the hardest part of education is ciphering through what we are told, and to convince ourselves which truths we should begin to apply to our own lives; how we can use them to change the world, all the while trying to discover the people who we really are and desire to become.
But we shouldn’t worry too much. There’s a comfort in analyzing the truths we choose to carry along with us. I would argue that what happens in my own life, the events I know pretty well, the things I tell myself, have no more or less significance for me than those who founded calculus or discovered the earth was round. They are at least as real to me as anything else I would read in a book or watch on TV as a little kid. In our search for truth, we should find this comforting. We are still very much in control of how we perceive things. Stories are always shifting and secrets that used to be hidden for others are often at some point revealed. The world’s a little less black and white than it sometimes seems.
It’s our own truths, the ones that we can write down from our own minds that matter the most. We own them. We are the only ones that can inhabit them. The only ones that can advocate for them. And we can’t neglect the power this holds. How we see the world individually is an amalgamation of our truths. This is important. This dictates how we interact with it. The truths we create for ourselves dictate how we view outside influences in day-to-day life.
When we’re ready, if we so desire, we should document our own truths. This could mean literally anything, but you may find it more valuable if it’s something that matters to you. Truths can be fleeting. We can document them if we write them down while we are interacting with them. Sometimes they make sense, sometimes they won’t. But that’s okay. What we consider to be our truths have the power to connect us with others, to improve others’ lives, to worsen others’ lives, to transform us, and to transport us into new perspectives. They don’t have to bind us. They can be flexible — we can call them ideas.
Furthermore, we may discover more about the truths we inhabit through sharing them with others. Through this, commonalities will be found, and differences too. From my experience, sharing my truths and listening to those of others provides a sense of community. It leads to a feeling of being more “human” regardless of who I’m interacting with. More importantly, it leads to a more authentic education, something that is undeniably tangible in my own mind.
An important aspect of the journey for truth is that we have the space in our minds to explore. Small efforts to allow ourselves some headspace each day, such as meditation or journaling provide good ways to engage with ourselves. More importantly these practices allow us to think about how things have rolled out for us in our lives, and how we choose to interact with what we believe to be our own histories.
If anything can be taken away from this article it’s this: Buy a notebook and start writing. You’ve only got so much time to find some truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What goes on outside Harvard’s gates affects us within. When the housing bubble burst in 2008, kicking off the Great Recession, so did our own.
At the same time, while Harvard students were not immune from the ensuing job struggle, 10 years later it is clear that the Harvard name cushioned us from the worst effects of the crisis. That cushion may be what has allowed many students who struggled in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis to derive silver linings and life lessons from the uncertainty they experienced.
We must acknowledge that the protection Harvard affords us will likely be just as powerful when the next recession comes, which might be soon. We cannot ignore how the perceived prestige of the Harvard name plays a substantial role in both formal job application processes and the informal ways people score jobs by using the Harvard network.
Nevertheless, the Great Recession did change the way some students thought their careers. Consider Harvard students’ relationship to the finance and consulting sectors. In 2007, 47 percent of seniors entering full-time employment did so in those sectors. By 2009, that percentage had dropped to 20. In the following years, the Office of Career Services saw more students exploring different, perhaps more personally fulfilling, paths.
A decade out, it appears that the trend is reversing. Of last year’s graduating class, 35 percent of those entering the workforce went into those sectors. While we cannot presume to speak for individual students’ motivations, we continue to encourage students to look past finance and consulting as default career choices. If nothing else, the Great Recession should have demonstrated to our more mercantile classmates that these sectors are not guaranteed tickets to wealth and success. And in general, considerations of future employability should not influence our college decisions too heavily, since too often we have overly narrow views of what exactly future employability means.
Nor should we need another crisis to remind ourselves that the economic concerns the recession brought to the forefront of national dialogue are ones that many college students across the country, including more at Harvard than might be assumed, have long cared about. The stresses of working to secure one’s economic future and balancing a job with studying, for example, have already been pressing concerns for some Harvard students long before the recession. (Who do you think likely cleaned up that Adams House faux-memorial party for the late Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers?)
Of course, it is inevitable that there will be another recession, and Harvard should be ready whenever it comes. To that end, we hope the OCS continues to expand the industries in which it offers students programming so that more students can take advantage of the resources Harvard offers to find jobs in careers that they actually want to pursue. We also reiterate our hope that University leaders continue to plan proactively for the next downturn.
Ten years later we can see that the recession shook, but did not destroy, the foundations undergirding the system that allows the elite — of which Harvard is an integral part — to maintain their socioeconomic status. How are we to reckon with that?
Perhaps here is a start: The counterpart of the idea that what goes on outside Harvard’s gates affects us within is, of course, the more familiar and flattering (but not false) idea that we can affect what goes on outside Harvard’s gates. As we seek to build a more egalitarian world, perhaps we should start with that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two bullets: One from a handgun, the other from an assault rifle. In the former, the bullet will cleanly pierce through the body. Its precise trajectory will knife through the interior vitals, entering suddenly and exiting abruptly.
The AR-15 is not so kind.
With three times the speed, this high velocity compound of lead and alloy is intended for the sole purpose of damage. It crashes through the unsuspecting victims in its path, moments before exploding in fragments of metal and tissue and blood. Maybe it’s a mercy that it happens so fast, that a hit by one of these bullets is so instant that the victim doesn’t have to process the “pulverizing bones, tearing blood vessels, and liquefying organs.”
The diagnosis of a handgun bullet wound is clear, a neat path of injury that can be traced by any radiologist. For an assault rifle there are only “shreds of an organ” left in the aftermath of the collision. It is this assault rifle model, the coveted AR-15, that is most commonly used in mass shootings in the United States.
As I write this, there have already been 358 mass shootings according to Gun Violence Archive in just 2019 alone. For perspective, today is day 312 of 365 in the same year. When you explore these statistics further, you’ll see the numbers in nicely curated visuals, each casualty mapped out with tiny red dots that scatter across this noble land of the free, and home of the brave.
Even staring right at the dots though, it’s hard to humanize them — to remember that each one is a representation of a fellow human who was once living and breathing, with favored clothing styles and specific music tastes, quirky habits, ridiculous memories, and of course dreams, so many of them. They were all people you see day to day: a Walmart shopper on a casual morning, community members celebrating on the Yakama Indian reservation, even just a 15-month girl, who probably didn’t know what a gun was before being killed by it.
I won’t lie and say I’ll remember all these names and cases, it’s not quite possible in a news world drenched with violence. But I thought of these numerous, faceless victims everytime I see a pro-gun stand on campus. It’s common for campus space to be used by a myriad of causes, but it was the first time I’d seen one advocating so proudly for the elimination of limits and regulations on the sale and use of firearms. Small as the stand was, its message was bold along a banner draped across the front, spelling out “COEXIST” with drawings of different gun models.
For a moment I considered stopping, struck with an earnest want to ask these people why they valued these weapons enough to take up shop on a college campus to demonstrate their commitment. I wanted to ask them if they knew was a gun wound looked like, if they’d ever seen the impact of an AR-15 and how it can make an “organ look[ ] like an overripe melon smashed by a sledgehammer, with extensive bleeding.” Did they still assert their pro-gun slogans to grieving mothers and fathers, thinking it would somehow comfort people to know that even if their loved ones were killed, at least they still had their unregulated gun usage?
I wanted to tell them about how I shouldn’t have, but still forced myself to watch the Christchurch shooter’s livestream. It might’ve been so wrong to do so, but I had to see it for myself — to witness the destruction and devastation of one twisted person in possession of such a weapon. My screen had blacked out with the end of the livestream but I sat for several moments afterward, stricken, raging, grieving — unable to understand what drives a human to kill. To let hatred and animosity and bigotry fester so deeply within the heart, and then to release it so violently.
I did not engage with those people on that day, and if that makes me a coward, you’re right: I am scared. I’m wary of how a conversation can escalate into an argument, the skewed dynamic of talking with someone who can acknowledge the weapon being advocated for has killed, will kill, was originally intended to kill, and still stand by policies to not regulate it.
For anyone who argues that’s a matter of constitutional right, that the Second Amendment is for all Americans — I would like to remind you that the law has been wrong. Rules and codes try their best, but they are not always just and moral, we’ve seen this in American history where slavery was once legal, and in the present where concentration camps are legal and used to hold immigrants. How do we prevent an American future where gun deregulation and violence are still legal?

Harvard Law School’s Animal Law and Policy Clinic sued the United States Department of Agriculture Wednesday on behalf of several animal rights groups for allegedly ignoring a 2014 petition calling on the federal agency to protect non-human primates used in lab research.
The animal welfare groups — New England Anti-Vivisection Society, Animal Legal Defense Fund, and International Primate Protection League — called on the USDA several years ago to widely disseminate standards promoting the psychological well-being of primates used in research in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. In particular, the plaintiffs are calling for standards similar to those adopted in 2013 by the National Institutes of Health for chimpanzees used in federally funded research, according to court documents.
The suit was filed with the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts under the Administrative Procedures Act. The Administrative Procedures Act requires federal agencies to respond to rulemaking petitions within a “reasonable” amount of time. The plaintiffs in the case claim that the USDA violated the act.
Judge Richard G. Stearns will hear the case, according to Animal Law and Policy Clinic spokesperson Sarah J. Pickering.
The USDA declined to comment, citing the fact that the case is pending litigation.
International Primate Protection League founder and board member Shirley McGreal said that monkeys are “totally capable” of experiencing suffering and discomfort and must be treated humanely.
“We've always had a terrific concern about these wretched monkeys. They're on the top of the animal world and they're so close to us. The kind of suffering that's inflicted on them is totally beyond belief,” she said. “We hope to see USDA really work on getting some proper standard to make life a little better.”
Harvard Law School students Brett W. Richey and Boanne R. Wassink are serving as counsel in the case. The two work under the supervision of the Director of the Animal Law and Policy Clinic Katherine Meyer. The animal law and policy clinic is one of the law school’s 22 in-house clinics. The clinics provide law students with the opportunity to work on cases as they complete their education.
Richey said the lawsuit’s immediate goal is to get a response to the petition, but that they have additional longer-term goals.
“We’re really hoping that through this lawsuit and maybe future action in the clinics that we can get some better, stronger regulations in place to promote the psychological well being of primates because primates have a lot of psychological, mental, emotional needs,” Richey said.
Wassink added that in addition to the case’s value, the work also provides good experience for law students.
“There’s real substantive work that the clinic’s doing for animals,” Wassink said. “Also for law students, it’s a chance to get real world litigation experience.”

Fewer than 40 percent of college students trust news sources, according to Project Information Literacy researchers Alison Head and Barbara Fister, who presented on the relationship between students and digital media at an event held Thursday at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
The event, titled “Information Literacy in the Age of Algorithms,” focused on strategies for educating students on critical reading skills in the modern information age. During the event, Head and Fister shared the data they collected from across the country on student attitudes toward media sources.
Head serves as the Director of PIL, a nonprofit organization that studies how students interact with information in the digital age. Fister serves as its inaugural scholar-in-residence, analyzing the link between technology, libraries, and society. Since 2008, more than 20,000 students have participated in PIL studies on issues like information access and media trustworthiness.
Head noted that this event was the first public discussion of their most recent survey of more than 8,300 university students from diverse educational and political backgrounds. She said that the study aimed to gauge how individuals and institutions have responded to the proliferation of information on the Internet.
“How aware are students, and how can they be better prepared? That’s how we started this study,” Head said.
She noted that a minority of the college students assessed trust in their news sources and that the public perception of news has entirely changed.
“Thirty-six percent is really damning. We had ten colleges and universities in that sample, small and large,” Head said.
Head said that they had not finished analyzing all the data from the survey.
She also elaborated on the decline of privacy in the digital age, which she said has bred further mistrust in students. Fister also noted that data is used in many contexts, beyond just media, that individuals have no control over.
“Our data is going into various places. We have no idea where it’s going really, and it’s being mined in a variety of ways, and the capacity to mine has never existed in the past. That’s being used not just to advertise to us in this very tailored way, but also to begin to predict and to nudge to push us into different directions. That’s happening in social settings where we aren’t even aware of it,” said Fister.
Head said that students have responded by becoming “very indignant” about violations of privacy. She said that many students now engage in defensive practices, such as installing ad blockers and using VPNs to access the Internet in order to protect their own privacy.
“They’re kind of proud of how skeptical they are," Head said. "They don’t trust their social institutions."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the United States Department of Education enters its tenth month of reviewing comments on a prospective Title IX enforcement rule, Harvard’s own policy-making processes remain stalled without federal guidance to direct their efforts.
U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos proposed a new Title IX rule in November 2018 which led a public comment period that closed in January. The rule would place additional restrictions upon colleges and universities that receive federal funding, including requiring live hearings with cross-examination for formal sexual misconduct investigations. The proposal received more than 100,000 comments, and federal law requires the DOE to review every comment before issuing its final rule.
Harvard’s enforcement of Title IX — a federal anti-discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s gender and sex-based harassment policies — is run by the University Title IX Office, which provides resources, and the Office for Dispute Resolution, which oversees formal investigations.
As the University awaits the federal rule’s finalization, its own policy-making efforts have ground to a halt. Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Donald H. Pfister, the chair of Harvard’s Title IX policy review committee, said the committee has been unable to consider substantive changes in the meantime.
“We are kind of waiting to see what the Department of Education comes back with, and how Harvard might relate or have to work on policy related to what the federal government is asking,” Pfister said in an interview last week.
“I don't know that there's anything we can seriously undertake until we know what we're dealing with, with the regulations,” he added in an interview Thursday.
In February, experts predicted it would likely take between three and 12 months for the DOE to read through all of the comments. A spokesperson for the Department of Education wrote in an emailed statement that the Department is still on track to release the new guidelines this fall.
For now, Harvard has turned its attention to its own campus climate. Earlier this year, the University participated in the 2019 iteration of the Association of American Universities survey on sexual misconduct. The results, which were released in October, showed that the prevalence of sexual assault on campus has largely remained the same over the last four years.
Pfister said that because the Title IX policy review committee is largely tasked with policy questions, they have not been significantly involved in efforts to evaluate the survey results.
When the federal rule eventually becomes codified — in a form that is not yet certain — Harvard may have to revise its current policies and procedures. Most of the University, for example, uses a single-party investigator model to adjudicate Title IX cases, whereas the rule will likely require a multi-party hearing. Harvard and a coalition of other colleges and universities submitted comments to the DOE criticizing the rule in January, specifically addressing the cross-examination provision and the mandated standard of proof in adjudicatory proceedings.
Once the policy review committee knows the final rule’s provisions, Pfister said they will get to work bringing Harvard into alignment.
“I think when the new guidelines come out, we'll be working hard,” Pfister said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives from the Federal Highway Administration discussed an upcoming project to rebuild a large stretch of the Massachusetts Turnpike with Allston and Cambridge residents, local activists, and elected officials at a public meeting at Brighton High School Wednesday evening.
The Highway Administration conducted the meeting in conjunction with MassDOT, which is supporting the project. In the meeting, officials went over a draft of an environmental impact scoping report for the $1.1 billion project, which will lower the Mass. Turnpike to ground level in Allston and elevate Soldiers Field Road along the Charles River onto a new viaduct.
The meeting began with an overview of the draft scoping report, which detailed several aspects of the project relevant to local residents, including information about how the project would affect the Allston environment and possible tweaks to the project’s design.
The dilapidated Allston viaduct — an elevated highway built in the 1960s — costs $800,000 to maintain every year, according to MassDOT. The project may take up to eight years to complete and will impact travel in Allston and radically change the western border of the neighborhood.
After the slideshow, presenters opened the meeting to comments and questions from attendees.
Mass. State Representative Kevin G. Honan, whose district covers much of Allston and Brighton, commented on the volume of traffic already present in the neighborhood.
“You mentioned that there are 150,000 cars coming through our neighborhood here, through Allston and Brighton,” Honan said. “And there's so much more development, obviously, proposed once the Turnpike, I-90, is straightened out.”
“It's going to be a lot more people working in this area, living in this area, so it's pretty critical... to really upgrade public transit in our neighborhood,” he added.
Several other residents and task force members came forward after Honan to share concerns about the permanent and temporary changes the project may impose — until comments were cut short by a power outage.
In an interview after the meeting, attendee Jordan C. Meehan said he is apprehensive about the project, particularly when it comes to how the traffic may impact Allston.
“There's already a lot of people who cut through the neighborhood to beat traffic on the Pike, and it's only going to get worse by exponentials,” he said. “I'm not sure what the way around that really is — doesn't seem like there really is one.”
Meeting organizers asked attendees to participate in a public comment period on the report, which closes Dec. 12. The Highway Administration will hold another public information meeting for the project on Dec. 4 in Framingham.

A panel of immigration experts discussed the impacts of the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals policy and shared concern about its future at a Harvard Law School panel Thursday night.
The event, called “What’s Next for DACA?,” highlighted the findings of the National UnDACAmented Research Project — a report exploring the impact of DACA on undocumented immigrant families.
DACA, a policy implemented under President Barack Obama that allows children brought to the United States as children to live and work in the country, was ended by the Trump administration in Sept. 2017. The president’s decision brought several legal challenges, and the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments on the end of the program Tuesday.
Roberto G. Gonzales, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the principal investigator of the National UnDACAmented Research Project, said that DACA is “inarguably is the most successful policy of immigrant integration we’ve seen in the last three decades.”
Gonzales opened the event with a summary of the findings from his research, in which he surveyed more than 2,700 undocumented young adults and performed 500 in-depth interviews after the institution of DACA.
“DACA has provided hundreds of thousands of young people and their families opportunities to experience social mobility in ways that they had not,” Gonzales said.
After presenting his findings, Gonzales sat on a panel that included Rhodes Scholar and DACA recipient Jin K. Park ’18-’19, Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office lawyer Jonathan B. Miller, Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition Executive Director Eva Millona, and Welcome Project Executive Director Ben Echavarría.
During the panel discussion, Park described the uncertainty that DACA recipients face.
“Those are seemingly questions that are very narrow in some ways, in scope, but have immense impact on how I live my life and how I think about the future,” Park said, referring to the arguments that the Supreme Court will hear next week. “The way that I’m thinking about it is to just do what I’ve done — it’s the only thing that I really know how to do — which is to just take things one day at a time and to kind of just hope.”
Park, who was the first-ever DACA recipient to receive a Rhodes Scholarship, testified before the House Judiciary Committee in March. At the panel discussion, he spoke about the challenges that immigrants face in the U.S.
“We ask immigrants all the time, what are you going to do for us? We don’t ask those questions to people who are U.S. citizens,” he said.
Miller, who heads the Office of the Attorney General’s Public Protection and Advocacy Bureau, described the current legal challenges facing DACA. Citing the lawsuit that Massachusetts and multiple other states filed in New York after the Trump administration’s announcement of DACA’s termination, Miller said he appreciated the timeliness of the event and Gonzales’s report.
“I think this was an incredibly inspiring event,” he said. “The report does an amazing job of explaining the impact of the DACA program for the recipients and their families, and it shows how work authorization [and a] social security number are incredibly powerful tools for economic opportunity, educational opportunity, and pathways for greater participation in civic society.”
“These stories are just so incredibly powerful and moving,” he added.
Echevarría said after the event, that he enjoyed his experience as a panelist.
“I thought it was important to be part of a conversation on, really, you know, a good portion of our youth who are affected by what’s about to happen,” he said. “I was excited to be able to speak about that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Increasing interest among students in artificial intelligence has prompted administrators in the Computer Science department and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences more broadly to grow its AI program.
Over the past 10 years, enrollment in introductory artificial intelligence course COMPSCI 181: “Machine Learning” has more than quadrupled from 35 students in 2009 to more than 150 in recent years. Computer Science Area Co-Chair Edward W. Kohler said the growing student demand has led administrators to focus not only on supporting existing faculty members who teach courses in artificial intelligence, but also on recruiting additional faculty members.
“I would say that we come close, but we are not able to meet the demand,” Kohler said.
Roughly 20 faculty members across SEAS and related departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences currently specialize in artificial intelligence — a number that continues to grow with recent and upcoming faculty appointments.This fall, SEAS welcomed Computer Science Professor Milind Tambe, whose work aims to tackle societal problems — such as wildlife conservation — using artificial intelligence. Ariel D. Procaccio, an associate professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who will join the Computer Science faculty next spring, applies artificial intelligence to problems in economics and education.
In addition to faculty appointments, several current Computer Science faculty members said they are planning to offer new courses in the coming semesters that focus on various aspects of artificial intelligence, from its basic foundations to its ethical usage.
Associate Computer Science Professor Yaron Singer, who studies the “intersection between algorithms and machine learning,” said he will teach a new course on the foundations of machine learning next semester.
In a September interview with The Crimson, Tambe said he will take over teaching COMPSCI 108: “Intelligent Systems: Design and Ethical Challenges” and hopes to develop a course at the intersection of public health and artificial intelligence.
In light of rising student interest in artificial intelligence, Computer Science faculty members are looking towards SEAS’s upcoming expansion into Allston as a means of growing their program.
Several Computer Science faculty members pointed to the current lack of space at SEAS as a constraint on further expansion of faculty research and teaching in artificial intelligence.
Kohler said the upcoming move will minimize the “dispersal and overlap” faculty members currently experience with limited office space. For example, Kohler said they share an office with Assistant Computer Science Professor Finale Doshi-Velez once a week to allow Doshi-Velez, who is primarily based in the Science Center, to have a space that is “close to the rest of us.”
“In Allston, we’ll be able to hire more faculty, hopefully, and great faculty in all areas, including AI,” they added.
In addition to increasing space for faculty, SEAS’s expansion into Allston will also support the development of new and existing courses.
“There’s going to be some really great new classroom space that I’m really excited about and many of my colleagues are also really excited about and that will transform all our classes, including our machine learning classes,” Kohler said.
Computer Science Professor Krzysztof Z. Gajos said the increase in space will enable faculty members to better accommodate the growing student demand.
“Teaching a 300-person class is neither pleasant nor effective, so I think for everyone’s benefit, it would be better if we had more classes, smaller classes, or some more specialized classes,” Gajos said. “Right now, people who take CS 181 come with very different preparations and very different expectations, so there’s definitely room for more courses."
Doshi-Velez said she shared Kohler’s optimism about SEAS’s upcoming expansion into Allston.
“It’s going to allow us a lot more space to grow our faculty, and growing in these AI areas is definitely something that is part of our future growth plans,” she said.

Bluestone Lane, an Australian-inspired café chain with locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, will open its new Harvard Square location Friday morning. The restaurant replaces Crema Café, a beloved Harvard Square fixture that closed last December.
The company manufactures its own coffee grounds and sells $29 matcha powder on its website. The café — with white walls, plants, and pillows in assorted blue and green hues —offers coffee and lattes and food such as salads, toasts, and potato wedges.
Andrew Stone, vice president of brand marketing and events, said Bluestone Lane, which was founded by his brother, Nicholas J. Stone, aims to provide customers with a personalized in-store experience.
“The sort of impetus of why the brand started was that longing for home, that connectedness — something in the area that you feel like a local instead of going to a mass chain,” Stone said.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she was happy to see the storefront filled after a nearly year-long vacancy.
“We're really glad that it's activated because it's been way too long already. These things just take such a long time between going through the permitting process in the city of Cambridge, and then doing the build-out, and then getting all of the final approvals,” Jillson said.
Bluestone Lane’s Harvard Square property is owned by North Carolina-based real estate company Asana Partners. Bluestone Lane currently operates more than 30 cafés and plans to expand to 100 locations in the next several years.
The new restaurant is opening in a landscape of extensive commercial turnover. Since the fall semester began, Square hallmarks including Out of Town News, Flat Patties, and Black Ink have announced that they will close by the end of the year.
Stone said Bluestone Lane is excited to join the Harvard Square business landscape and plans to host events in the café.
“We're invested, and we want to be part of the small business community,” said Stone.
Bluestone Lane hosted a “soft opening” for friends and family of store employees on Thursday afternoon.
Ashleigh D’Mello, an Australian-born, Boston-based lifestyle blogger, said Bluestone Lane’s offerings reminded her of home.
D’Mello said avocado toast was her favorite of the dishes she sampled.
After all, as D’Mello pointed out, avocado toast was invented in Australia.

Sexuality educator Isy E. Abraham-Raveson, who specializes in consent, body image, and gender as it relates to children, discussed the history of reproductive rights and advocacy with roughly 20 attendees in Fong Auditorium Thursday evening.
Harvard College ReproJustice Action and Dialogue Collective hosted the event as part of programming for Harvard Sex Week. The discussion focused on how reproductive health issues have affected people of color throughout U.S. history.
Abraham-Raveson opened the discussion by asking attendees how they defined the phrase “reproductive justice.” Audience members responded with answers relating to abortion, consent, menstrual products, and the landmark 1973 abortion rights case Roe v. Wade.
She then asked attendees to reflect on their experiences related to reproductive health. Audience members spent several minutes writing down their thoughts, which they later shared in small groups.
Abraham-Raveson led participants through an exercise in which they constructed a timeline of historical issues related to reproductive violence, like sterilization and eugenics, as well as modern legal restrictions on access to abortion.
In another exercise, she asked attendees to categorize reproductive health issues that particularly affect certain groups, like immigrants, racial minorities, and BGLTQ people. Participants wrote down their ideas on posters and then shared them with the rest of the attendees.
Toward the end of the event, Abraham-Raveson led the group in a discussion on advocacy for reproductive health.
Isabel MarionSims ’23 said she believes one of the most important parts of reproductive health advocacy is education.
“It would act as inspiration for a lot more people to join in advocating, which would work as a catalyst for change in general,” she said. “The more people who know and think it’s a problem, the easier it is for things to change.”
Guadalupe M. Jacobson-Peregrino ’21 agreed with MarionSims and said education enables people to understand their rights and medical options available to them.
Many of the attendees said they found the event to be very educational. Maria Keselj ’23 said she enjoyed learning about the history and context behind reproductive health issues.
Jacobson-Peregrino said she learned a lot from this event, even though she has taken a number of classes on the subject as a Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentrator.
“Now, I’m thinking about it as the colonization of women’s bodies and how, in order to reverse it, we need to decolonize the female body,” she said. “How do we decolonize the female body? It brought a whole new jumping-off point for my mind.”
Abraham-Raveson said after the event that her goal was to educate attendees and encourage them to share their experiences with one another.
“I like to think of myself more as a facilitator than a presenter,” Abraham-Raveson said. “My mission is to get people excited about something important, get them in conversation about it, provide them with some knowledge that they may not have already had, and direct them towards action steps.”

Harvard administrators relocated several Dunster House affiliates into temporary accommodations after discovering an outbreak of mold in September, according to several affected students.
Kazi Tasnim ’22, who lives in Dunster, said House administrators moved residents of two separate suites to “emergency singles” and empty spots in suites throughout the house for more than two weeks. Harvard brought in an outside contractor to clean up the mold during that time, according to Zachary M. Gingo, associate dean for physical resources and planning for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“We were out of the room for like two and a half weeks,” Tasnim said. “They initially said it would take like a month, but they fixed it — they got rid of the issue sooner.”
Maintenance staff discovered the mold — located on the east side of Dunster’s second floor — while investigating a “minor leak” in the ceiling Sept. 3, Gingo wrote in an emailed statement. They found the fungus growing between layers of the walls after opening them up to make necessary repairs.
The College and the University’s Environmental Health and Safety department contacted an outside contractor that stripped wet material and mold out of the walls, according to Gingo. After the completing the clean-up, maintenance staff repaired and repainted the walls so residents could return.
Tasnim said that knowledge of the mold situation was “just between us” — the affected students, Resident Dean Michael S. Uy, and other Dunster staff — and not shared with fellow House residents.
“Our tutor had, I think, emailed the entryway … construction’s going on, it’s going to be a little loud,” Tasnim said. “But I don’t think anyone said anything to the House.”
Dunster Faculty Deans Cheryl K. Chen and Sean D. Kelly, Building Manager Lucia Baldock, and Uy did not respond to requests for comment.
Though mold and mildew can have adverse health effects, Gingo noted that Harvard was not notified of any health issues related to the “isolated incident” of mold in Dunster.
Exposure to mold can cause cold-like symptoms as well as itchy eyes or skin for some people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those with allergies to mold or asthma may experience more severe reactions, which can include fever and shortness of breath.
Mold spores are likely to grow indoors in moist areas, and standard building materials form a particularly nutritious breeding ground, according to the CDC.
Gingo added in his email that mold is common in buildings and that the University is focused on mitigating mold and water damage. He noted that though residents were displaced, the clean-up is complete and will not need any follow-up.
“It is important to know that mold and mildew are present in virtually all buildings,” Gingo wrote.
Mold, however, is not the only public health hazard plaguing Harvard’s undergraduate houses. Seveal students say they have faced pest infestations in their suites.
Quincy House resident Keshav M. Rastogi ’21 said that toward the beginning of the semester, one of his suitemates’ singles was “sort of infested with mice.”
“I think he spotted probably four to five different mice over the span of two weeks,” Rastogi said. “They captured a few and let them out at various places that were far away from Quincy, and they still kept getting more.”
Rastogi said house maintenance staff responded quickly and set up glue mouse traps around the room. Though these traps didn’t catch any mice, he and his roommates set up a device that emits high-frequency sounds that deter rodents.
Eliot House resident Kaitlyn M. Rabinovitz ’20 said she has noticed a number of cockroaches in her suite this semester.
“Eliot's known for having a lot of roaches,” she said. “We've seen quite a few of those even though we don't keep any food or anything out.”
Rabinovitz said she blames insect-related dust for serious respiratory problems that began when she moved into Eliot.
“Since living in Eliot, every single semester I’ve been at Harvard, I’ve been diagnosed with bronchitis or pneumonia, which is, like, not normal,” Rabinovitz said.
Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe wrote in an email that she had not been made aware of the pest issue.
“No one has brought this to my attention, nor to the attention of our building manager,” she wrote.
House administrators and resident deans for Eliot and Quincy did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Quincy Faculty Deans Deborah J. Gehrke and Lee Gehrke.
Gingo wrote that, despite concerted efforts to eradicate rodent and insect populations in the houses, such uninvited guests are inevitable in Cambridge.
“In an urban environment, pests are always present,” Gingo wrote. “Our maintenance practices focus on excluding them, and we have been making steady progress on this front both through routine maintenance and House Renewal.”

Captain Natasha Gonzalez ripped a vicious cross-court forehand at her opponent, Erica Di Battista of Boston University. Di Battista was unable to handle the shot and missed the return long: once the ball landed beyond the baseline, Gonzalez turned towards her teammates and let out a triumphant roar.
With the point, Gonzalez had won the finals match and the flight A singles bracket for Harvard at the Harvard Invitational last weekend. Her performance highlighted the team’s outstanding showing at the event, which included teams from Boston University, Cornell, and Georgetown. The Crimson won 15 of its 20 singles matches and nine of its 13 doubles matches en route to five flight victories. Gonzalez, who also won the flight A doubles alongside sophomore Rachel Eason a day prior, ended the invitational with a first-place finish in both flight A singles and doubles.
“We’ve been training really hard all fall,” Gonzalez said. “So it's really exciting to get to put what we've been working on in practice in matches, and to see the hard work pay off. The whole team did very well which is very exciting.”
On the first day of the event, Harvard won six of its eight doubles matches and seven of its nine singles matches. In the flight A doubles bracket, Gonzalez and Eason powered through opponents from Cornell and Boston University to reach the championship round, which took place on day two of the invitational. Sophomore Rachel Lim and freshman Sophia Ho also won their matches against Cornell and Georgetown to set up an all-Crimson clash in the flight A championship match. In their singles matches, the team swept all six matches across flight A, flight B, and flight C.
“I think we were really excited for this weekend because we've been putting in a lot of hours on court and also on fitness. So I think everybody was really ready training for this weekend,” Lim said. “And I think the results this weekend are just a really great reflection of all the work that we're putting in.”
The Crimson women responded to tougher competition on the second day of the invitational with another set of strong performances. In the flight A doubles finals, Gonzalez, Eason, Lim and Ho put together a fantastic match that eventually ended with a hard-fought 7-6 victory in favor of Gonzalez and Eason.
In the flight B doubles finals, first-years Demi Snyder and Mihaela Marculescu posted a dominating 6-2 victory over their Boston University opponents to secure the doubles crown. Harvard also performed strongly in singles play, with Gonzalez, Marculescu, Lim and Ho all winning their semifinal matches to advance to finals on day three.
On the third and final day of the invitational, the Crimson continued to shine by winning the flight A, flight B, and flight C singles championship matches. Gonzalez, Marculescu, and Ho each secured titles for Harvard to conclude an incredible weekend for the hosts.
The Crimson does not have another competitive match until next March, when it squares off against Rhode Island at home on March 7th. However, the team will look to keep working hard and avoid complacency during the offseason.
“We are lifting a little bit more now. And we’ll keep practicing. And we'll just be doing practice matches with ourselves, probably play a tournament over winter break, and then come back in January sharp and ready to go,” Gonzalez said. “There's still things [we] want to work on that [we] are going to work on now. And we're going to build on so that when we come back in the spring will be stronger.”
“We're really happy with [the results from this weekend], but even more so it's motivation for us to keep working hard to get to the level where we want to be as we head into the spring season,” Lim added. “[We’ve] been working out in the gym, we've been doing a lot of hard work like increasing the weight of everything, we've been getting faster and stronger. And I think we've been focusing a lot on like holding each other accountable, trying to get each other to be really focused on pushing each other and having that immense team support.”

This past weekend, the Harvard men’s soccer team continued to struggle in conference play as it fell against Ivy League rival Dartmouth 3-1 at home. After keeping it tied up at 1-1 for a majority of the first half, the Big Green pulled away with goals late in the first and early in the second.
Having yet to win a game this season, the Crimson (0-12-1, 0-5-0) was a heavy underdog who had the opportunity to spoil Dartmouth’s (6-6-1, 3-1-1 Ivy) chances at an Ivy League championship. The team came into this game ready to give its home crowd an upset by rejuvenizing its lackluster offense that hadn’t scored since October 4th.
Having been outscored 14-1 in conference play, the Crimson could have been underestimated by the Big Green. It was necessary for Harvard to take advantage of this mentality by scoring early and seizing control of the game from the start. Once the Crimson found the goal, it could maintain a strong defensive presence that would allow it to dictate the pace for the rest of the game.
However, as has been the case for most of this season, Harvard ceded the early momentum by letting Dartmouth score in the first three minutes. The Crimson was playing catch-up from the beginning and allowed the opposing team to find an early rhythm in its offense.
Unlike its previous games, Harvard was able to strike back and score to counteract any early momentum gained from its opponents. In the ninth minute of the game, first-year forward Willem Ebbinge had his first career score on a penalty kick after he was tripped from the left side of the goal. The goal was the quick response the Crimson needed if it wanted to get back into the game.
For the rest of the first half, both teams played stalwart defense, with neither side conceding a goal for thirty five minutes. It looked like Harvard would enter the half with the game tied up, and the momentum to pull off the upset in the second period. However, the Big Green would turn the tide of the game as first-year forward David Alino would send a cross to senior midfielder Zach Kalk whose strike would land the ball in the back of the net.
Scoring with just over thirty seconds left in the game allowed Dartmouth to regain momentum and go into the half with a 2-1 lead. This momentum would carry on into the second period as the Big Green took the field with new energy. Five minutes into the half, sophomore midfielder Ohad Yahalom scored his first career goal giving Dartmouth a 3-1 advantage.
The score would remain the same for the rest of the game as the Big Green used its momentum from the end of the first half to seize control early in the second period, and cruise for the rest of the game. Although Dartmouth came away with a victory, the Crimson significantly improved its offense from its previous conference games. Sophomore forward Alfred Perez put four of his five shots on target as the team outshot the Big Green 12-11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There's not much solace but in any endeavor in life — something you really pour your heart and soul into — if you've given it everything you possibly can, you have no regrets. The problem is you have plenty of pain. But you can have no regrets.”
These were the words of Harvard coach Tim Murphy following the Crimson’s devastating last-second loss to undefeated Dartmouth last weekend. Playing on home turf, a dominating defensive performance ended in a loss as the Big Green secured a wild Hail Mary as the clock expired. Both squads will be heading to New York this weekend. The Big Apple offers a possible Ivy League crown for Dartmouth and a bounce-back game for Harvard.
“That will be a game that some of us probably won’t forget for a long time,” senior offensive lineman Liam Shanahan said. “You just have to move on, it’s college football season and we have another game this week.”
This weekend, the Crimson hope to bounce back to what Murphy referred to as “one of the absolute historic gut wrenching losses.”
“It's a day by day process, but the leadership has been great,” Murphy said. “This week, the attitude has been great. Now, and now as I said many times, how well we played isn't diminished by loss. It just makes it more painful.”
Harvard’s defense clearly had one of its best performances of the year. Before the final play, the stout Crimson defense had surrendered only three points on 229 yards, highlighted by a stingy run defense that held the Big Green to only 51 yards throughout the entire game for an abysmal 2.0 yards per carry.
“We're going to analyze this to death,” said Murphy of the Dartmouth game. “And then we're going to bury it, and we're going to move on.”
If the analysis highlights the strong defensive performance, then the moving on must look relatively positive for Harvard. The Big Green offense that was stymied by the Crimson had not previously failed to top 28 points in a game this season, leading the Ancient Eight heading into last week, and Harvard broke an impressive streak of three-straight games in which the Dartmouth offense topped 40 points. This week’s offensive unit lining up across from the Crimson does not have the same resume.
Last week’s defensive matchup between Harvard and Dartmouth meant points were at a premium. For Columbia’s offense, points have been just as hard to come by this season. The Lions are second-to-last in scoring among Ivy League teams, averaging only 20.4 points per game this season, a full touchdown below the sixth-ranked Penn. Finding the end zone has not been the only offensive problem. Columbia ranks dead last in both rushing and passing yards, setting them well behind the pack offensively. The Lions are the only Ancient Eight team to average less than 340 yards of offense per contest, sitting at a low 271.6 total yards per game.
It is doubtful that the Crimson defense will serve as a remedy to these woes if recent games are any indication. Harvard trails only the powerhouses Princeton and Dartmouth in yards allowed this season, and the Crimson’s defensive front paces the Ancient Eight. Harvard has allowed a miniscule 499 yards rushing this year, easily tops in the conference, as the next best rushing defense in Princeton has allowed 675 yards. Columbia is the only team averaging less than 100 rushing yards per contest, making for a difficult ground matchup for the Lions.
This is not to say that there will be another single-digit scoreboard this weekend. While the Columbia offense has struggled throughout the season, it has still shown an ability to put points on the board. Just two weeks ago, the Lions dismantled Penn 44-6 in a dominating performance. While its drubbing of Penn gave hope to a turnaround, Columbia has followed the victory contest with back-to-back losses in which the defense gave up a combined 104 points. It is on the offensive side of the ball that the Crimson hope to attack and improve.
“We’re trying to look at their defensive schemes and see where we can try and find where they’re vulnerable,” Shanahan said. “But ultimately it will come down to us being ready to play on Saturday.”
Harvard is sure to follow the lead of Shanahan and the rest of its offensive line. In last weekend’s slugfest, junior running back Devin Darrington doubled Dartmouth’s rushing offense with 102 yards on the ground, firmly keeping him in second in rushing yards among Ivy League backs.
Last weekend, the stagnant Crimson offense was unable to match its incredible defensive performance. This week, however, that is the last thing on anyone’s mind.
“We have no other choice to reach our full potential and get ready to beat what we think is a good Colombia team,” Murphy said. “And that's what we've done.”

After 16 seasons as an assistant coach for one of the nation’s most consistently competitive Division I men’s lacrosse programs, Gerry Byrne had no shortage of offers once he started fielding calls about head coaching positions.
When push came to shove, though, Byrne wasn’t lured away from his assistant coaching job at the University of Notre Dame by one of the already-established D-I powerhouses that he entertained offers from. Instead, it was Harvard — a team that finished with a sub-.400 winning percentage last spring — that got him to leave South Bend, Ind., the town where Byrne attended graduate school and raised his family.
The decision, on its face, is somewhat perplexing. Byrne said that he “ultimately would have been the head coach” of the Fighting Irish “at some point.” Notre Dame has appeared in the NCAA tournament for 13 straight years and made a run to the quarterfinals last season. But he opted to leave for a program that has made it to the national tournament just twice over the same timespan.
Why?
“This was unbelievably appealing,” he said. “It’s Harvard.”
In an interview in his still-under-renovation office inside Dillon Fieldhouse, the former UMass Amherst standout made clear that he is excited about the challenge of bringing Harvard men’s lacrosse back into the national spotlight.
“It’s a much more interesting to take this opportunity now because Harvard’s not happy with where they are,” Byrne said. “There’s a belief — I would say almost an expectation — that Harvard should be in the national conversation in lacrosse when they see teams in their league already in the national conversation. I have been fortunate to have been offered every really good job over the last 10 years and said no for different reasons — family, or timing. And this one, which is the furthest away from being in that [national] conversation, was the most interesting.”
Byrne acknowledges that there is work to be done in order to get the Crimson to compete on a national level. Harvard finished last season 5-8, with just one win over an Ivy League opponent.
“They lost big in a lot of games,” Byrne said, “which is big by lacrosse standards — almost big by football standards at times.”
But still, he says there isn’t a large talent gap between the Crimson and the rest of the Ivy League.
“The difference between a team that's 10-5 and one that's 5-10 is usually not as wide as it would appear to be,” Byrne said. “I don't believe there's a massive talent gap between Harvard and the other teams in our league. The presumption from maybe your perspective would be, ‘Wow, what do you have to fix.’ And part of it is just a kind of a clarity of goals — a clarity of expectations, and clarity of the pride and the privilege of being a student-athlete at Harvard.”
Captain Kyle Anderson says that the team has practiced with an urgency this fall that he hasn’t seen in past years.
“When we came back to school, there was a different intensity and a different tenacity, especially out of our upperclassmen, who have done an amazing job,” the senior said.
Anderson interviewed the final six candidates for the head coaching job on the phone.
“I was kind of keeping guys in the loop as much as I could and giving some feedback to the other seniors,” Anderson said. “Honestly, everyone was really hoping that Coach Byrne would take it. ... We're just really happy that he took it.”
The team was without a coach for more than two months over the summer. During that period, upperclassmen organized workouts and ensured that players stuck to a program given to them by the strength and conditioning coach in the spring.
Byrne, who Anderson describes as a coach who is “really well-known in the small community of lacrosse” as a “defensive genius and a cultural driver for the Notre Dame team,” has brought a new coaching style for players to adjust to.
“His coaching style is definitely different from our previous coach, but I think teams adjusted pretty well,” senior midfielder Nigel Andrews said. “He’s definitely a coach who demands respect from his team.”
Andrews said that Byrne is more outspoken in practice than former coach Chris Wojcik ’96, whose contract wasn’t renewed in early May.
“Previous years, if we messed up in practice or something, most of the times it would be assistant coaches or us stopping practice and getting on guys,” Andrews said. “There wasn’t a lot of yelling, you could say. But I’d say Coach Byrne is definitely more vocal during practice, getting on guys and making sure everybody’s doing drills in such the right way.”
Anderson described the changes that Byrne has brought to practices as “refreshing.”
“Byrne is definitely a much more intense presence on the field, and I think that's something that we have needed as a team,” Anderson said. “People are starting to understand, even though you’re getting criticism and you're getting instruction, it doesn’t really reflect badly on you as a person, he just wants everyone to get much better.”
Players also said that Byrne sets forth few off-the-field rules for the team.
“He expects us to basically hold each other to a high standard, which has definitely been awesome so far,” Andrews said. “It has definitely made the team closer and I think it’s worked out pretty well.”
Despite last year’s disappointing results, the men’s lacrosse team hardly sees itself as in the midst of a rebuilding phase.
“Since I've been here, our team has always had tremendous talent,” Andrews said. “It’s just about organizing ourselves right away and utilizing our talents correctly. I definitely think that Coach Byrne is somebody who will be able to utilize us — utilize the guys that we have — the right way. So I definitely think that this year we could make a deep run into Ivy League tournament and the NCAA tournament.”
For Byrne, the challenge of cultivating a winning culture for a struggling Harvard team was what brought him to Cambridge.
“The excitement of creating something that’s never been before — what's more romantic than that?” Byrne asked.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the no. 18/15 Harvard men’s hockey team and the Princeton Tigers had something to prove Friday night, meeting for the first time this season at Bright-Landry. After a back-and-forth opening game, the Crimson wanted to stabilize its defensive play and pocket more league points; the Tigers, coming off a strong weekend against St. Cloud State, surely hoped to stick it to another ranked team. Add to this mix a freshman goalie for Harvard, and you have a fascinating ECAC showdown.
Nevertheless, the result was dramatic. Despite several offensive pushes, Princeton (1-1-1, 0-1-0 ECAC) was unable to fend off the Crimson (2-0-0, 2-0), whose quick-strike play and stellar goaltending led the way to a 3-0 victory. Rookie net-minder Mitchell Gibson is the only Harvard backstop to post a shutout in his NCAA debut in the 15 seasons Ted Donato ’91 has been head coach.
“[The Tigers] play with a lot of energy,” coach Donato said. “...I think we needed to elevate our game to play the same pace that they were playing at. I thought as the game wore on we were better with the puck, and put it into some areas where we could play fast.”
The first period was by and large the Tigers’ show, as the visitors wrested control of the game after a 4-on-3 opportunity early in the frame. Though it was unable to capitalize, Princeton continued to pile on the shots, but Gibson fended off the onslaught.
With time trickling down, sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone found freshman forward Nick Abruzzese with a stretch pass. Abruzzese had a step on the lone Tigers defender still in his own zone, and fired the puck into the top corner, beating junior net-minder Ryan Ferland. His score came with just five seconds left on the clock. The Crimson left the ice after the first having been outshot, 12-7, but holding the 1-0 lead.
“I knew there was probably 20 seconds left when I got the puck,” Rathbone said. “That’s just Nick finding the seam. He can skate, so I just knew I had to get him the puck and then he did the rest.”
Princeton’s physical style and fast pace meant Harvard could not afford to sit back, however. The squads traded chances through the first half of the middle frame; Ferland had a particularly strong save on sophomore forward R. J. Murphy, who attempted to tap in a centering feed from junior forward Henry Bowlby only to be stumped by the net-minder’s pad. But the Crimson added to its score 13 minutes into the second frame, courtesy of Bowlby himself. Another long pass from Rathbone caught Bowlby cheating behind the Tigers; the junior turned on the jets and shot the puck right past Ferland for his first of the season.
In contrast to its relatively low shot volume in the first frame, Harvard found several opportunities in the second, particularly on odd-man rushes. One such chance saw sophomore forward Jack Drury with linemate Abruzzese in a 2-on-1; Drury’s shot attempt met neither net-minder nor net, but rang off the far post.
When the Crimson found another such chance, though, it did manage to bury the biscuit. This time junior forward Jack Badini was the puck-carrier. His initial five-hole shot was stopped by Ferland, but the puck pinged off the near post, carrommed into Ferland, and slid back over the goal line. Badini’s first tally of the year comes on the heels of a solid performance last weekend, when the center picked up three assists.
Though no goals were scored thereafter, the third period was not uneventful. Harvard’s man-advantage squad had two separate powerplay opportunities; though the first of these featured promising puck movement, with the top unit staying out for an extended shift, the Crimson was unable to capitalize.
“We’re doing everything but putting the puck in the back of the net,” Rathbone said. “...I don’t think we need to change anything, actually, I think it’s just a little bit more perseverance, just knowing that once one falls it’s probably going to be floodgates.”
Despite this, the four minutes of penalty-killing forced the still-threatening Princeton squad onto its heels, and that may have made the difference. Ultimately the Tigers were unable to muster enough momentum to break Gibson, leaving Harvard with two points and the rookie with a record for recent history at least.
Gibson’s 31 saves tell only half the story; throughout the game, the freshman’s poise and rebound control kept his team steady even when the Tigers came in wave after wave. After senior net-minder Cameron Gornet’s victory last weekend, it was unclear if Gibson would see ice time so soon — nor is it an indicator of who will be in net for Saturday’s game, coach Donato said.
“Coach Donato told me [about the decision] at the end of practice yesterday,” Gibson said. “...Felt good going in before the game, felt confident. First period was a little bit shaky...but [I] got settled into the game and the boys kind of took care of business… Just wanted to finish it off in the third.”
Several skaters have emerged as early contributors for the team. Rathbone’s seeing-eye passes and playmaking abilities earned him three assists, and he paces the Crimson in points (2–3—5). Badini, known last year for his remarkable faceoff win percentage, has also been putting up numbers (1–3—4). Among the freshmen, Abruzzese (2–2—4) seems perfectly at home playing on the top line and the top powerplay unit.
Of course, the weekend’s second challenge still looms. Tomorrow the Crimson must face no. 15/- Quinnipiac, its first ranked foe of the young season. With more ECAC points on the line, Harvard will have to clean up its play and bring another offensive push to the dangerous Bobcats.

Now that it’s cuffing season, you may have been persuaded to shoot your shot a few times, but there’s a line between going for it and pursuing a dead end. Here are some ways to know if that Harvard student you’ve got your eye on just isn’t into you.
They Look Board When You Mention You Have Extra BoardPlus to Blow
This may be cheesy, but if your crush turns down free mozzarella sticks, they might have been stringing you along. On the plus side, the grille you’re at will never grill you about your past relationships or break your heart.
When You Tell Them You’ll Save Them a Spot in Lecture, They Ask You to Take Notes
I’m not here to lecture anyone, but if you attempt to get more face time in by saving them a seat in lecture and they take that as an offer to take notes for them as they sleep in, they’re unfortunately sleeping on you. You might be hearing “notes,” but what they really mean is no-tes.
They Give You the Cold Shoulder
If your attempts to use the cold weather to flirt fall flat, that’s your cue to move on. If you offer her your Harvard Athletics sweatshirt and she tells you she’s not cold, athlete or not, you’re out of the running. And if you say you’re cold and he says “I can’t control the weather,” it’s time you dropped the man and get yourself a jacket.
The Dhall Default
If you invite them to eat in the Square and they consistently default to Harvard University Dining Services, that’s dhallmark of disinterest. In other words, if you’re looking for hugs but get HUDS, it’s time to digest the hard truth: They’re just not into you.
The Phony
If they’re always on their phone when you see them but you get hours of radio silence to your “How was your day’s,” it’s time to call it quits. While it’s possible that they just are that busy, chances are, you’re better off dialing it back.
It’s a tough world out there, and finding love is hard. But rest assured, the earlier you know when to cut your losses, the more time and energy you’ll have to expend on the right person.
