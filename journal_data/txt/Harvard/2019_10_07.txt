This review contains spoilers for the premiere of “The Good Place” Season Four.
Season Four of “The Good Place” opens exactly where Season Three left off, at the onslaught of an interdimensional experiment to determine the overall structure of the afterlife humans are placed into — whether a soul is sent to The Good Place or The Bad Place. If that sounds overcomplicated and confusing, that’s because it is. The very premise of the show is confusing. For a moralistic show that examines the ethics of behavior, this is par for the course.
Season Four is no exception to this general rule of overcomplication. Though this is because the show uses the absurd plot for the sake of comedy. The experiment, devised by former Bad Place demon Michael (Ted Danson) aims to prove to the all-knowing Judge Gen (Maya Rudolph) that humans are not inherently bad, and can even improve their morality within the afterlife. The group of Bad Place residents from Season One — Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), Tehani Al-Jamil (Jameela Jamil), and Jason Mendoza (Manny Jacinto) — with the help of Michael and the embodiment of all universal knowledge, Janet (D’Arcy Carden), hope to convince the Judge that the point system explored in prior seasons is flawed and makes it impossible for anyone to achieve entry into the real Good Place.
While distracting, this overcomplication doesn’t lead to a net negative. It turns out to be the perfect tool to focus the audience on what is most important in the show: the characters and their development across multiple episodes.
After the twist in the Season One finale that reveals the main characters to actually be in The Bad Place, the show ventured into new territory by continuing to create its own mythological interpretation of the afterlife.
Each subsequent season adds more bits of information about the structure of this afterlife, and the absurdity, complexity, and asininity of its rules are the butt of many of the show’s jokes, such as the numerous nonsensical names of the restaurants in the background. While this choice to add complexity produces some chuckles, for the most part, it’s not the greatest source of comedy in the show.
Rather, the heart and soul of “The Good Place” comes from its most central characters and the actors who portray them. With a plotline that derives its humor from its complexity, this complication can get in the way of the show’s appeal to its audience. For this reason, the performances by the main characters are what keep the show captivating, especially the show’s main focus: Kristen Bell.
Bell has an innate ability to bring humor to any joke the writers give her, no matter how dull or dry it may seem: Her delivery and mannerisms give life to the character and to the show itself. In the premiere of Season Four, Eleanor takes on the role of the architect to the experimental afterlife they have created. Overall, Eleanor has progressed over the four seasons from being a deplorable, narcissistic, and selfish living human being to an understanding, compassionate, and kind dead one. This slow-burn evolution of Bell’s character reflects perfectly what the show is meant to prove: that people can change. Although Eleanor is mainly a comedic and entertaining role, Bell executed the change in her character admirably.
It’s these character arcs, perfectly crafted by the writers and the actors, that keep the audience watching for four whole seasons and anxiously awaiting to see what comes next. The other actors in the show all bring their own unique take on this transformation from “bad” to “good.” Even Michael, a literal demon, was able to change into the major proponent for the reconstruction of the afterlife in favor of giving humans a chance to prove their worth.
While the show’s storyline gets more complicated throughout the seasons, the characters and their true natures become clearer with every action they make. The real focus of the show is to portray the growth of a person. By creating a world so incredibly convoluted and difficult to follow, the writers are able to bring a greater spotlight to what is most important and central to the themes of the story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a decade ago, Zach Galifianakis began interviewing celebrities on what would become the Emmy-winning online talk show, “Between Two Ferns.” Now, with an absolutely star-studded cast, "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" takes on Netflix for a cross country comedy with more interviews, more awkward stares, and of course, more ferns.
Basically an agglomeration of “Between Two Ferns” episodes, the movie follows Zach Gallifianakis and his ragtag crew across the country as they attempt to complete 10 interviews in two weeks for a chance at his own network talk show. Who do they interview? Try Matthew McConaughey, Brie Larson, Keanu Reeves, and Chance the Rapper for starters, but the list goes on.
The online show first aired on Funny or Die in 2008 and took off a few years later through YouTube. Some of the most viewed guests include Brad Pitt, Justin Bieber, and Barack Obama. In each episode, Galifianakis asks his guests degrading but occasionally hilarious questions without giving them time to answer. His rolling insults and gawky stares fuel the show, but the awkwardness that “Between Two Ferns” thrives upon produces mixed results. Viewers find themselves caught in a three-way staredown, feeling as uncomfortable as the celebrity interviewee, or howling at Galifianakis’ crude humor. There’s no in-between.
Fortunately for "Between Two Ferns: The Movie,” there are more ridiculous comedic moments than awkward stares — at least in the interviews. Outside of the “Between Two Ferns” interviews, there is little to no substance or consistent humor in this film. The characters have rather bland personalities and count on their random behavior for punchlines. When Carol Lauren Lapkus walks in lugging a 1998 Apple iMac and introduces herself as Galifianakis’ “right hand woman,” it’s easy to laugh at the absurdity of her job. But by the time she pulls a trumpet from her purse and says she never learned to play because she thought she’d be too good, the gag doesn’t convey anything about her character — it just relies on shock factor for laughs.
The entirety of the film depends on the interviews, and for good reason. If you didn’t know of the online show before, you watched "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" because you knew every actor! It’s the same tactic “Movie 43,” starring Hugh Jackman, Dennis Quaid, Kate Winslet, and so on, used in 2013. A laundry list of actors is sure to capture anyone’s attention, but unlike “Movie 43,” the actors starring in "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" don’t act. They aren’t supposed to. They’re supposed to sit and be berated by Zach Galifiankis while withholding their laughter, and that’s supposed to be the source of comedic tension. But people who haven’t seen the online show wouldn’t know that, and so would be disappointed.
What’s the big deal? If the movie is funny, it shouldn’t matter how much the bankable stars act. Unfortunately for Netflix, it does. "Between Two Ferns: The Movie” is a Netflix original. The laundry list cast is more than a marketing tactic — it’s a last ditch effort. According to Forbes, this year Netflix is expected to spend $15 million on original programming, but they’re already $10.4 billion in debt. Their massive push in original content comes from rising competition, most notably from Disney. Without original content, Netflix no longer sets itself apart from other streaming services. Not only does Disney have years of highly popular original content, but they’re pulling that content from Netflix’s platform. The imminent domination of Disney on the streaming market seems to have pushed Netflix into producing content as rapidly as possible. On top of original content, Netflix has been buying access to big name films like Scorsese’s “The Irishman” coming out on Netflix just weeks after the theater premiere. Netflix can’t afford to disappoint their viewers.
"Between Two Ferns: The Movie" is a critical movie for Netflix in this battle for a unique stake in streaming services. And while the film did have hilarious moments, it was just an extension of a short YouTube talk show — not movie material. In fact, the funniest part of the whole movie was the credits blooper reel. Was it enough for Netflix to draw in more subscribers before the launch of Disney+? Probably not. But if you’re a true Netflix supporter, "Between Two Ferns: The Movie" is a gem for a quick Friday night viewing party.

Last week, William A. McConnell ’21’s opinion column criticized Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — of which we are members — for three reasons: our platform prioritizes optics over effective strategy; our tactics are too abrasive; and we are responding to unfounded climate alarmism.
McConnell’s first flawed assumption is that we operate purely on “optics,” not strategy. Divestment is one of many solutions to the climate crisis, based on a belief that we cannot create necessary systemic change while continuing to reinforce broken systems. Harvard would join $11 trillion worth of already-divested funds, helping to remove the social license of companies profiting on the destruction of our planet.
The second critique is of our tactics. Blockades and protests may rub people the wrong way, but that’s the point. Disruptive protest opens conversations around marginalized and oppressed ideas. We draw inspiration from a long history of activism that has driven the University to take necessary action in the past (similar tactics led to the creation of African and African American Studies department in 1968-70). Before our campaign, Harvard largely refused to even engage in conversation about divestment.
Finally, we don’t have time for minimization of the climate crisis. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change gives us until 2030 to drastically cut emissions or hundreds of millions will face extreme poverty and despair. Our fears are founded by internationally accepted, consensus-based science, not unfounded panic. We seek urgency because right now, we’re not doing enough. On this point, even University President Lawrence S. Bacow agrees.
At the end of the day, Divest Harvard is fueled not by fear, but by hope. The climate crisis is not a lost cause. It’s an overwhelming challenge and that’s why we’re starting at home. We can turn inwards, towards our own University, the world’s richest, and do our best to ensure that when it comes to the climate crisis, Harvard lands on the right side of history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council has begun considering scheduling options for the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston, due to open next fall. Unfortunately, past significant logistical changes, such as last year’s implementation of the new academic course schedule, cannot be said to have gone especially smoothly. Given that, we hope the administration has taken special care to learn from and avoid the mistakes of that process as it turns to scheduling for the Allston campus.
Integrating Allston into the College next year will require a number of complex logistical maneuvers to function well if it is not to worsen the learning experience of students attending classes there. As many students’ aversion over the distance to the Quad demonstrates, geography is not a problem to underestimate or under-plan for. And the Allston campus raises other problems, like guaranteeing students timely access to food and minimizing the number of trips necessary in a given day.
But ultimately, our biggest worry is that the College and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is spreading itself too thin. The geographic divergence of campuses, residential facilities, and disciplines runs counter to the liberal arts commitment that students have access to a broad range of opportunities and experiences by encouraging siloing between the various geographic spaces.
We are concerned the University has not adequately considered the possibility that the physical separation of the SEAS campus from the rest of the school will lead to a deeper psychological one as well. Scheduling choices will not just determine the times when students take classes; they will have effects on academic philosophies. To that end, the new scheduling system should not operate under the assumption that all SEAS students will necessarily spend most of their time in Allston, even if the faculty hope to arrange classes such that travel time between the two campuses is minimized.
It would be a shame if timing and logistical issues discouraged technical students who want to pursue and integrate other non-technical disciplines from doing so. Diverse combinations of classes and disciplines are exactly the ones we should encourage — combinations that would not be easily anticipated by a proposed new predictive easing algorithm to calculate conflicts between popular courses. Indeed, we have previously stated our support for initiatives which seek to join disparate fields together, as they fulfill the College’s professed mission of offering a premier liberal arts education.
That said, this proposed predictive easing algorithm is a positive indicator that FAS is looking to take these challenges seriously. It aims to anticipate pairs of courses SEAS students might take in the same semester and control for time conflicts. Such a tool would in fact be valuable not just for classes taking place in Allston, but all classes across FAS. Since the new scheduling system allows for fewer time slots in the day than the previous system, it appears that students of all disciplines are facing more conflicts between classes that prohibit them from taking courses they would ideally take together.
However, given the University’s prior technological fiascos, most recently with my.harvard during shopping week, our optimism for this algorithm is tempered with a healthy dose of caution. And of course, technological stopgaps that help alleviate the problem of geography, such as this predictive analysis tool or a desperately needed more timely shuttle system, can only be that — stopgaps.
As Allston’s opening date nears, the administration naturally must turn to these thorny practical issues. But we urge FAS and the University to keep in mind that effective scheduling for Allston is about more than logistical integration.

The journey through studying your own communities leads to desensitization. You learn how to swallow your pain to produce writing. Your identity and experiences become intellectualized. You find a sense of control in advocating for yourself through your research, fluctuating between feeling overwhelmed by your personal connection to your topic and your detachment in turning it into a research project.
We learn to give presentations about topics so closely linked to our own marginalized identities and traumatic experiences without flinching. Rehearse and rehearse until you perfect it. The audience wonders how you do it. Some thank you for your contributions. Others invalidate your work as “me-search,” putting it on a lower rank and overlooking its importance as academic work.
While there is a joy in feeling like your fingers are running on autopilot on the keys of your laptop as you get your message across, there are also stark reminders that the trauma doesn’t leave you when you pour it out onto the pages in neat sentences and citations. There are also times when the words don’t come because you feel burnt out.

When I took my first immigration class, I felt seen. I felt validated. I felt recognized.
I saw it as my first “fun class” mixed in with my math and science classes at the time. I appreciated the balance it brought to my STEM focused schedule my first year of college. But one class did not feel like enough. It felt like I was drowning in STEM, so I dropped that path and followed my passion: studying immigration. Because I had only ever taken an immigration class as a “fun class,” I was under the impression that life would be easier now that I had steered away from my intended chemistry concentration.
My first semester studying immigration, I declared a concentration in History and Literature for the Ethnic Studies track and finally felt like I was where I belonged. I took on more and more immigration classes throughout several departments. Though I felt happier with all that I was learning, I noticed the effect these personal topics had as I began to feel like my own personal experiences, my classes, my relationships, and my extracurriculars revolved around immigration.
I noticed the intense anxiety as I felt trapped in my studies and wondered if I made the right decision. Reality was setting in that this was not going to be easier than STEM. The passion kept me going as I got more and more hopeful for what I was studying, but the occasional stress still found its way in. This stress is different from academic stress. This one is personal.
Once I finally figured out a balance with my life and research when it came to immigration, my work took another turn as I encountered more readings in my class on social movements that forced me to come to terms with my confusion around my sexuality. I learned about my own sexuality as I studied gay liberation and became more interested in the Undocuqueer Movement. I felt like I was able to come to terms with my sexuality thanks to academics like Gloria Anzaldúa and Audre Lorde. Figuring out my sexuality became a new research project. Their work became a driving force for me as I hoped my own writing could one day have the effects theirs have.
I added Women, Gender, and Sexuality as a joint concentration, took four WGS classes my junior spring to catch up, and found myself feeling a similar overload to when I took on too many immigration classes. Outside of class, I experienced a homophobic microaggression that resulted in me shutting down one weekend. Readings were piled up for me to complete, but I didn’t feel like I had the capacity for them. How was I supposed to do any readings when I still had so much of my own internalized homophobia to work through? How could I read about immigration law and detention when my own future felt so out of my own control?
***
There have been many instances when I need to step back from my work because my personal life gets in the way. It becomes hard to separate the two. The anxiety is recurring as this work becomes complicated. We risk burnout. We worry we’ll be seen as imposters in our own communities. We open ourselves to negative feedback from academics who don’t have a personal stake in our work the way we do. We have to stand up for ourselves as we try to carve room for ourselves in the academy.
In thinking about going on to grad school after college, I worry about how to make this work sustainable. It is important to find a balance. We have to learn how to take breaks from it. We need constant reminders that we are more than our research and the parts of us that fuel it. We need to constantly remind ourselves the purpose and worth of our contributions when we feel like we can’t escape our research or when people try to invalidate it.

Harvard Extension School welcomed around 350 recently admitted degree candidates at its second annual convocation on Saturday at Memorial Church.
This year, the Extension School admitted over 1500 students to its various degree programs, Dean of Academic Programs Suzanne C. Spreadbury said in her speech. Students at the convocation have been taking Extension School courses for several semesters already. Completing two to three degree courses is required before students can apply for program admission.
In her address, Spreadbury said the recently admitted students came from 54 countries and included more than 100 US veterans or active military members. She also said most of the students were full time professionals in their thirties.
Other speakers at the event highlighted the sacrifices that students and families make to accommodate classes while working full time. Michael F. Fabiano, the president of the Harvard Extension Alumni Association, acknowledged the difficulty of balancing classes with a family, job, and other commitments.
“You have to be the biggest advocate for your time, and you have to make it all work — kids’ soccer games included,” he said.
The last speaker, Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert, urged students to feel like they belong at Harvard, a sentiment that other speakers expressed, too.
“One of my most proud accomplishments since I’ve been here is, for the first time in history, the rest of Harvard — all the professional schools, the Corporation, Board of Overseers, and senior management — all understand who the Extension School is and what it does, and why it’s earned a place at Harvard,” he said. “Anybody who tells you you’re not really at Harvard, correct them. They’re wrong."
Bachelor of Liberal Arts candidate Colton S. Eicher said some of the speeches’ focus on inclusion stuck out to him.
“It is kind of weird coming in through this door and trying to find a community within the Harvard community. I found that somewhat difficult, but I could imagine if you’re not on campus it’s even harder,” he said.
Jennifer H. Devine, who is pursuing a masters in management at the Extension School, said she thought acknowledging family members' roles in students’ lives was significant.
“They are the often all too silent heroes,” Devine said. “It was very important and poignant for me to make sure that they got that public acknowledgement.“
The Extension School serves students around the world, and the audience members hailed from many different cities. Keysha W. Taylor, a recently admitted Bachelor of Liberal Arts candidate, said she had traveled to Cambridge from North Carolina, and had met other audience members from Alaska and Canada.
A livestream was available for students too far away to attend, like Arohi J. Bangera, who lives in Dubai and is pursuing an A.L.M. in Digital Media Design. In an interview two weeks ago, she said she planned on watching the event.
“The tickets are really expensive, and I'm going to be there for like two days,” she said. “But I will tune into the livestream. I saw the highlights from last year's convocation, and I thought that it was really beautiful.”

Ten of 22 candidates for Cambridge City Council made their case to voters Sunday night at an open forum, discussing issues from affordable housing to the state of businesses in Harvard Square.
The forum, held at Lesley University, was sponsored by the Cambridge Citizens Coalition and was the third candidate forum in the past several weeks.
Keeping in line with the most recent forum directly related to environmental issues, many candidates spoke about climate change, and how the city can reduce its impact. Candidate Nicola A. Williams said she believes any new building in Cambridge should have to be certified as a net zero emissions project. Candidate Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 addressed the city’s ongoing issue with the loss of its tree canopy, arguing that its continued degradation presents a “real danger” to residents.
“For us to pretend that trees are not as important as people that is a false dichotomy, because everybody needs trees,” she said.
Candidates also touched on the state of Harvard Square, which has recently seen a number of closures. Williams called the area “pathetic,” citing constant construction and high vacancy rates. She did, however, say that she has worked with the neighborhood association to address the issue.
“There is hope folks, I’m part of the neighborhood association, we got together and did planning the right way,” she said, citing recent efforts to address the Square’s issues.
Some challengers also criticized current councilors — two of whom attended Sunday evening — for how they have chosen to address challenges across the city. Candidate John Pitkin said the city council cannot “micromanage” every issue affecting Cambridge residents, and called for the city to work more closely with neighborhood associations.
“They’re essential conduits of information from people to our government,” Pitkin said.
The candidates also addressed affordable housing in Cambridge, focusing on the contentious affordable housing overlay, which has been hotly debated since it was introduced in March. The proposed zoning reform seeks to incentivize developers to build affordable housing units in Cambridge by streamlining approvals processes and reducing costs.
In a September meeting, the city council unanimously voted to table the proposal until the next council could address it after it became clear that it would not have enough votes to pass the measure.
Charles J. Franklin said that though he supported the idea of an overlay, he did not approve of the city’s proposal.
“The thing that really killed it was that the city did not respect existing neighborhoods and neighbors when they came up with this plan,” he said. “It's the same theme of city doing what they want and alienating people.”
City councilor and candidate Craig A. Kelley, who opposed the overlay in the council, reiterated his stance at the forum, saying the plan would have done “basically nothing” to increase the supply of affordable housing. With a one vote margin of defeat in the current council, he said, the elections could decide whether it passes the council.
“I would like it fixed before we decide to move forward with it if we ever do,” he said. “Make no mistake, this next election is a referendum on the affordable housing overlay.”

Winthrop House residents say the House’s atmosphere has improved this semester after the departure of former Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., who attracted controversy for his decision to represent Harvey Weinstein in court.
Interim Faculty Deans Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan, who were appointed in July, will continue to lead Winthrop until the College finds a permanent replacement for Sullivan and co-Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson.
Roughly a dozen Winthrop students said House life has become more active this semester; those who lived in Winthrop last year said they experienced a marked contrast when they returned to the College after the summer.
Winthrop resident Audrey E. Pettner ’21 said she thinks the House’s atmosphere is “so much better” under Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s leadership. She said the two have spent more time in the dining hall and invited students to the faculty dean residence more regularly. She added that she hopes the next set of faculty deans will follow their lead.
“I'd hope [to have] someone that would uphold similar principles of community involvement,” Pettner said. “I don't even think I realized how absent our other faculty deans were until this semester. I don't know if maybe they're just extra involved because of how crazy it was.”
Sullivan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on student criticisms of his tenure.
Sullivan announced in January that he would serve as part of Weinstein’s legal team as the Hollywood producer faces criminal charges including rape and sexual assault. Months of student outcry and protest followed the announcement.
After completing a months-long “climate review,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced on May 11 that he would not renew Sullivan and Robinson due to the “untenable” situation the pair had created in the House. The College has stated that their dismissal was not directly related to Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein.
The day before Khurana’s announcement, The Crimson reported allegations made by a dozen current and former Winthrop tutors, students, and staff that Sullivan and Robinson fostered a toxic environment in the House over the course of their ten years there. At least 13 tutors threatened to quit at one point, though they ultimately stayed. Sullivan and Robinson have denied allegations that they contributed to a negative climate while they led Winthrop.
Immediately after Khurana’s announcement, Sullivan and Robinson released a statement saying that they were sorry that the controversy surrounding them had contributed to “stress” among Winthrop residents.
Winthrop resident Noah Y. Epstein ’21 said he hopes the permanent faculty deans will prioritize student interaction like Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan have, adding that he thinks improvements in House culture began at the end of the spring semester.
“Already last semester, by the end, I felt like there was a lot of positive energy for hope for growth and hope to move past whatever had happened to get us back to being a functioning house,” Epstein said. “Because when the national news is writing articles about you, no matter what, it's not really functioning.”
Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers wrote in an emailed statement that she thinks the House’s climate is, and will continue to be, positive.
“Winthrop House is great, the students know what's up and we're going to be just fine,” Chavers wrote.

The Undergraduate Council voted to allocate funds for its Cultural Celebration Week and a bike subsidy program for low-income students at its general meeting on Sunday.
The UC allocated $5,100 to fund the Cultural Celebration Week. The event will comprise a discussion forum on Oct. 24 and a Cultural Celebration Night in the Smith Campus Center on Oct. 26, according to the legislation. Both events will be open to all College students.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 co-sponsored the legislation to fund the programming.
The cultural week is in part a response to the fact that “several cultural and affinity organizations have noted the need for events that bring together these various groups,” according to the legislation.
The Smith Campus Center allowed the UC to rent the space for Cultural Celebration Night at no cost, according to the budget breakdown. As a result, the majority of the funds will be used towards catering services during that event.
The event will feature a student DJ and a playlist with songs requested by various cultural groups on campus, according to Palaniappan.
Madison A. Trice ’21, the Council’s Director of Inclusion and Belonging; James Mathew ’21, the Council’s Chief of Inclusion and Belonging; and the Harvard Foundation Student Advisory Committee Chair, Adinawa D.M.A. Adjagbodjou ’20 will lead the discussion forum. The Student Advisory Committee is a group of representatives from student organizations that have a mission of “improving race relations and promoting intercultural awareness and understanding,” according to the Harvard Foundation website.
Huesa said that she and Palaniappan reached out to student cultural organizations on campus to help plan the event.
“This event looked pretty different a few weeks ago than what it is now,” she said
The UC also voted to allocate $6,000 for a bike subsidy program for students that are Student Events Fund-eligible.
The UC first piloted a bike subsidy program in 2018 for SEF-eligible students living in the Quad and quickly expanded the program to include students living in Mather and Dunster Houses after it received significant student interest.
This year, all SEF-eligible students at the College, including freshmen and students residing off-campus, will qualify for the program.
While freshmen were not eligible for subsidies in the proposed legislation at the meeting, Oak Yard representative Ethan J. Johnstone ’23 submitted an amendment to include freshmen, which the Council passed.
The program will provide a $50 subsidy to a maximum of 120 eligible students to purchase a bike, scooter, or skateboard.
Students living in the Quad, Dudley Community, or off campus will receive priority for the bike subsidies over students living in River Houses and freshmen, according to the legislation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 100 Harvard affiliates participated in roundtable discussions at the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response’s day-long conference on gender-based violence Friday.
The conference featured multiple panels of experts and activists who work to prevent gender-based violence. Keynote speakers Global Executive Director of No More Pamela Zaballa and Latinos United for Peace and Equity Co-Founder Ruby White-Starr highlighted the global nature of the issue, arguing that people must work to overcome their biases to combat the problem.
“Prevention for gender-based violence needs to be truly a global effort. It can’t be what we do in our office every day,” Zaballa said. “It has to be a collective effort.”
White-Starr said people cannot fully comprehend issues of oppression until they recognize their privilege and “increase cultural capacity” to understand others’ experiences.
“Increasing our capacity includes being aware of our own biases,” Starr said. “It’s not about learning why that person is that way. It’s about learning why you are the way you are and why you believe what you believe.”
The panels gave activists and professionals in the field an opportunity to share their work and discuss the healing process for survivors of gender-based violence. In between the panels, participants took part in workshops ranging in topic from “Recognizing and Responding to Violence Against Students with Disabilities” to “The Whole System Approach: Global Perspectives on Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention.”
Several panelists spoke about the impact of gender-based violence on historically marginalized groups.
Panelist Eileen Hudon (Mashkawaziiziibiikwe) — founder of Mending the Sacred Hoop, the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition, and Women of Nations — said she started a sexual assault advocacy training program for Native women of all ages. The program’s weekly meetings incorporated drums, which Hudon said are symbols of healing.
“Every graduate of our sexual assault advocacy program made a drum,” Hudon said. “Now, that is a very powerful thing because through assimilation and altercation we are told as Native women that we shouldn’t bang on a drum or have a hand drum.”
Filmmaker and activist Aishah Shahidah Simmons shared details about her work, which has compiled stories from people of diverse backgrounds who have experienced gender-based violence. Her latest project, an anthology titled “love WITH accountability,” encompasses 43 stories and explains how accountability is a necessary form of love needed to address child sexual abuse.
Simmons said she faced challenges while working on the 2006 film “No! The Rape Documentary,” which explores issues of sexual assault through personal testimonies by black women, because her project challenged stereotypes.
“There was a lot of resistance and anger about presenting patterns and assessments,” Simmons said. “It didn’t follow the stereotypes of the narrative that people had.”
Some of the panelists had done work in higher education institutions and drew from those experiences.
University of Michigan Director of Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center Kaaren Williamsen said it is important to meet the needs of victims of gender-based violence by allowing them to tell their stories without interruption or hostile questioning.
“My goals have shifted along the way in my career to figure out how can we create institutional responses that do these things,” Williamnsen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A weekend set of home games brought some familiarity and some unknowns. The two matches had little in common: Ivy play and interleague play, unranked rival and top-25 opponent, a history of wins and no history at all. The games themselves were similarly different - a fast start and a slow start, a blowout and a forced overtime.
There was, of course, one constant: Harvard’s ability to walk away with the win.
HARVARD 2, LIBERTY 1 (OT)
For the second consecutive game when facing a ranked opponent, the Crimson headed to overtime against No. 13 Liberty (7-2, 3-0 Big East). The last time, the extra session had proved too little, and Stanford defeated Harvard on penalty strokes. On Sunday, the Crimson (7-2, 2-0 Ivy) undoubtedly sought a different outcome.
Only five minutes of extra time were needed for that different outcome to emerge. After back-and-forth play to open overtime, sophomore midfielder Kiley Allen arched a pass over a defender’s stick and into the possession of senior forward Maddie Earle. A Liberty defender quickly covered Earle, who settled, dodged, and passed to junior co-captain Mimi Tarrant. Tarrant ripped the ball to the left corner, just past the reaching leg of Flames goalie Alison Schaefer, to end the game.
After a tired first half, Harvard took to the field not with the slump of a team down by a goal and with only two shots in the game, but with the vigor of a squad on a five game hot streak. Seven minutes into the third quarter, the Crimson earned a penalty corner. Sophomore midfielder Kiley Allen corralled the pass and settled it for co-captain Bente van Vlijmen, who took a step to the left and - as she has done on penalty corners all season - drilled it home.
The fourth quarter saw little production from Harvard but continued domination, with the Crimson’s defense shutting down Liberty’s powerful offense. A diving save on a Flames penalty corner from sophomore goalie Ellie Shahbo late in the fourth preserved the tie, giving Harvard’s offense the time it would need to score again.
Liberty entered the game with one of the nation’s best defenses - the Flames held the highest goals against average, allowing opponents only 0.57 scores per game - and an offense with the sixth-highest number of goals per game, at 3.71.
When Liberty junior forward Jill Bolton ripped in a rebound in the eighth minute of play, a distinct possibility emerged that the single score had already nailed the coffin shut. The Flames had allowed more than a single goal only once the whole season, giving up two in a win against Yale where Liberty always led.
Although plenty of play remained in the first half, the Crimson was unable to notch a single shot, offering little encouragement that Harvard could overpower Liberty’s robust defense once, let alone twice.
A second half turnaround put all the woes of the first behind, as the Crimson doused the Flames to dominate on both sides of the field. In the end, Harvard emerged with a win over one of the nation’s top defenses for its highest-ranked victory of the year.
HARVARD 6, PENN 2
Quakers are not famed for their aggression, and the performance from Penn (3-6, 1-1 Ivy) against the Crimson on Saturday did little to adjust this notion.
Riding the momentum of a four-game win streak and eleven-game win streak in regular season games against Ivy opponents, Harvard leapt out to an early lead, preserving the same offensive speed and efficiency from its last match, a five-goal shutout of New Hampshire.
Six minutes into the game, junior forward Natalie Sicher - who scored the game-winner in last year’s 2-1 win at Penn - rushed the ball downfield from near the Crimson goal to Quaker territory, and quickly passed to van Vlijmen in the shooting circle, who tapped the ball by Penn goalie Ava Rosati.
“We know that Penn likes to get a lot of [players around] the ball,” said Harvard head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “As long as we transfer and find that quick, easy pass, we should find some space…. As soon as we find that space, we have a lot of quality that can go to that space with speed.”
Twenty-four minutes later, another two goals - from sophomore forward Rachel Greenwood on an assist from van Vlijmen, and a Tarrant goal on an assist from freshman midfielder Emily Berlinghof - had been added to the board, and the Crimson was on the right side of a 3-0 lead. The Harvard defense - a freshman-heavy unit that has coalesced effectively in recent weeks into a machine that stops opponents with the reliability of clockwork - had held the Quakers to zero shots.
“Our back four defenders [were] really tight on the opposite players, just keeping them outside the circle, and [there was] a lot of communication coming from the back,” junior defender Hannah Pearce said. “Our goalkeepers chat a lot to us - where to push them [and] keep them out wide.”
The second half saw no additional mercy from Harvard. Eight minutes in, sophomore midfielder Olivia Hoover scored on a second van Vlijmen assist, and a pass from Greenwood to senior forward Casey Allen five minutes later extended the Crimson’s lead to five.
Penn junior forward Erin Quinn managed to find long and straight path to the goal in the opening minutes of the final frame to put the Quakers on the board, but Harvard responded soon after when freshman defender Mazarine Broze tapped in a rebound off Rosati on a penalty corner.
By the end of the day, six different Crimson players had contributed goals in the 6-2 win.
“It’s a really good reflection of where we are as a team, in that we don’t rely on any one player,” Tarrant said. “We’ve got a squad of 24 who… can score goals. That’s really great going into future games, because other teams won’t just be marking one player, and we can rely on our whole set of forwards and midfielders to be scoring.”
Harvard travels to Newton, Mass., to face No. 13 Boston College on Thursday before returning home to continue Ivy League play on Oct. 13 against Brown.

Mentally cursing yourself out because you didn’t check your class’s midterm schedule? Looking at your Google Calendar and freezing with anxiety?
We’ve all been in that place where we have back-to-back (or back-to-back-to-back) exams, but these next few weeks don’t have to be filled with soul-crushing sobbing in Lamont. Here are some tips for studying when you have a totally packed midterm schedule.
Start Early
Yes, we consistently plan to do things much earlier than we actually do. But for every time you’ve pulled an all nighter grinding out that pset due at 9 a.m., this is the one time when studying in advance matters. Plan out your week and block out time for each subject so you’ll be ready when exams roll around.
Procrastinate with Other Subjects
Tired of your calculator screen? Turn your attention to some supply and demand graphs instead! By avoiding organic benzene structures with other materials, you’ll keep yourself engaged — and keep the grind going.
Ditch Cabot, or Anywhere You’re Likely to See Your Friends.
Everyone knows that Cabot Science Center Library at night is more busy than any final club party on the weekend, and that’s even more true during midterm season. You’ll plan on grinding out three chapters of Statistics 111: “Introduction to Statistical Inference,” but will end up chatting with the cute kid in your 9 a.m. instead. The Smith Campus Center is usually pretty quiet, but if you need real privacy, the Widener stacks are great!
Sleep!
For those of you who force yourself to study until the sun rises over the Charles: Stop lying to yourselves. No information has entered your brain since you left to grab El Jefe’s. Your brain makes memories as you sleep, so all-nighters do more harm than good by hurting your recall skills during an exam. Make sure to grab at least seven hours of sleep the night before your exam for maximum retention.
Actively Study
Although rereading the textbook four times may seem more appealing than redoing your psets, passive studying never really helps. To really master concepts, we suggest making a study guide for yourself, quizzing yourself with practice problems, or explaining it to a friend.
Get Some Pretty Study Materials.
If you’re like us, Zebra Mildliners and Muji pens keep you going through a tough time — nice stationary gives us the illusion of productivity. With fun colored pens and highlighters, you’ll be more excited to beautify your notes and somehow learn in the process.
While a lot of these tips may be tough to absorb, choosing just one and sticking with it will relieve stress in the coming weeks. And if not, Harvard’s grade inflation will hopefully save the day — and your grade.
