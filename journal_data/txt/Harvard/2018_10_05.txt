After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was just as shocked as the next person to learn that “The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” exists — not as a college student-written, “A Very Potter Musical”-esque parody, but as a genuine professional, off-Broadway show, set for national tour in 2019. But I was even more surprised when I discovered that the musical is actually good. Really good.
It is not just the energetic score, clever lyrics, and talented cast that makes this show so enjoyable. It is the all-too-rare lack of a romance at its core. Based on the first book in Rick Riordan’s “Percy Jackson and the Olympians” series, which follows the paths of modern Greek demigods, the musical is remarkably faithful to the novel. In the book, the main characters are 12 years old, and unlike the writers of the widely panned Percy Jackson movies, the creators of the musical didn’t choose the pandering, lazy tactic of making the leads five years older and including a romance. Instead, the serious abandonment issues of the characters — most of whom have never met their godly parent, let alone been raised by them — are given the spotlight, alongside themes of forgiveness, morality, and what it means to be a family.
This decision breaks a long tradition of injecting romances into stories to ensure commercial success. One of the most well-known examples is the recent Broadway version of Disney’s “Newsies.” The Tony-winning show, like the Disney film it’s based on, takes its inspiration from the newsboys strike of 1899 in New York City. Protesting a harsh price increase, child newspaper hawkers — known as “newsies” — stopped buying and reselling papers to convince the publishers that they deserved fair pay. The leader of the historical strike, Louis “Kid Blink” Baletti, was described by the New York Times as “an undersized boy” who was blind in one eye; when the story was adapted by Disney, Kid Blink was replaced with the clichédly charming dreamer, Jack Kelly, and a female character was added as his romantic interest.
The writers of the musical did a much better job than those of the film at creating a three-dimensional young woman who plays a key role in the strike, but the romance between the characters is unnecessary in both iterations. The heart of the story is teamwork and righteousness, underdogs rising up to demonstrate the power of their collective voice. If the writers wanted to add female characters to the narrative — which in fact they should — they could easily add young women as fellow strikers. Instead, they reduce the only woman in the rebellion to the object of the male lead’s infatuation.
“The Lightning Thief” is a model example of how to showcase strong women in their own right without tying their worth to men. Annabeth, one of Percy’s companions on the quest, is a fully fleshed-out character with her own motivations, backstory, and personality, a crucial member of the trio. The token love song is not missed on the cast recording. Instead, its absence leaves room for the regretful ballad “The Tree on the Hill,” which takes details familiar to readers of the book, reframes them, and creates a new narrative that is compelling for both established Percy Jackson fans and first-time audience members. Rather than celebrating the union of a couple like so many finales, “Bring on the Monsters” is a triumphant closing in which the characters choose to face the monsters — both mythological and metaphorical — in the real world over the easy route of remaining in their safe haven.
In a society where everything from comedies to car commercials flaunts happy couples, there is something special about a musical that does not treat romance as the only indicator of success. “The Lightning Thief” highlights the values of friendship, bravery, and believing in oneself when no one else does. It provides a much-needed respite from an otherwise hyper-romantic culture, reminding the audience that there is more to life than dating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to doodle on church pamphlets. Each service was a competition between my friends and me. We stifled giggles, drew cartoons, passed notes, mocked the pastor — whatever we could get away with in the few feet of pew space we were allotted. Only the first notes of the organ could move my eyes from my pamphlet to the hymnal, and, without hesitation, I would sing at top volume. I didn’t always know what the words meant, or to whom, if anyone, I was singing, or why, like so many others, I didn’t just stand in silence and leave the singing to the choir. When we prayed I kept one eye open. When we learned about Jesus in Sunday School, I daydreamed about the food waiting downstairs. But when we sang, I felt like someone was listening. I do not know if I believed in God, but I always felt like he could hear me better when I sang.
I walked into the crowd for Julien Baker’s set at the 2018 Boston Calling Music Festival with no context save for a Google search, a quick skim of her music on Spotify, and some second-hand—and by second-hand I mean from Tumblr—knowledge that she was queer and Christian and made music that many described as “healing.” That combination was enough to pique my interest. On a day with a lineup headlined by Eminem, the primary interest of the two friends from home who flanked me on either side, Baker seemed like a bit of an anomaly. She entered to as much applause as the crowd could muster before hands were shoved hastily back into pockets and ponchos — the day was decidedly chilly and rainy — and gave a soft introduction:
“Hi guys, my name is Julien Baker and I’m gonna play you some songs.”
Clad in a black button-down and pants, her rainbow guitar strap the only burst of color on an otherwise dark stage, she opened her mouth to sing. It immediately became clear that her introduction was an understatement. She began her set with “Turn Out the Lights,” a song about self-confrontation in moments of solitude, but it wasn’t until the chorus that she let her higher register go. She sang the line “When I turn out the lights,” raw and repeating again and again into a rapid decrescendo into “Between myself and me.” Her vocals are a far cry from anything other than a far cry, defined as much by their desperation as their beauty. When she sings, she opens her mouth as wide as it can go, as though she’s trying to project her voice far beyond the festival crowd.
At the song  “Rejoice,” whatever facade of objectivity or “okay-ness” I had constructed to get me through my third day without sleep fell to pieces. “But I think there’s a god and he hears either way / when I rejoice and complain,” she howled, placing all her emphasis on the extended vowels of “rejoice” and “complain.” Again she fell into a repetition, this time of  the word “rejoice,” each time projecting her voice into our ears and up to the sky. In the gasping, vocal tipping point, she asked “Why did you let them leave and make me stay?” and I stopped taking notes. My mother likes to tell me that she has seen God. That years ago, at the intersection of unspeakable loss and grief, what she felt in that moment convinced her to keep going. In listening to Julien Baker that afternoon, I felt something similar.
In watching Baker sing to God, my own days in church didn’t seem so far away. At the sight of my tears, a friend from home (who had come to the festival solely to see Eminem) wrapped her arms around me and said, “I love you, Allison,” and home didn’t seem so far away either. In the song “Shadowboxing” Baker sang, “But there is a comfort in failure / Singing too loud in church / Screaming my fears into speakers.” What Baker knows, and what I can only remember, is that music amplifies sound far beyond where it would otherwise go. By singing hymns on Sunday mornings, I felt that someone beyond the rows of people in pews could hear me. When Julien Baker sang to us all that day, we stood in silence, listening, but we were not the only ones.
When I woke up the next morning, the festival was gone. I walked down Massachusetts Avenue, alone in the drizzle and the haze, wondering how the streets around me could be so empty. I watched Cambridge disappear behind me through the window of a commuter rail train. At my stop I dropped my suitcase and fell into the arms of a person I love and who loves me. As he starts the car I say, “I have new music for the rainy day,” and we listen to the opening notes of Baker’s “Appointments.” I don’t say a word and neither does he. We both listen.

The metro ride home was more crowded than usual on the day that I died. Resting my head on the window beside me, I couldn’t help but feel guilty as I watched an elderly Asian woman board the train and stand by the doors. I struggled to find a comfortable position for my head against the window, and I continued to watch the woman as she threw accusatory glances towards the indifferent businessman seated in front of her.
“Step back, doors opening. When boarding, please move to the center of the car.”
Pushing my backpack onto my lap, I squinted and tried my best to make out the current stop on the red LED monitor towards the middle of the train car. No luck. Crowds of passengers made their way on and off the red line as the train came to a stop, obscuring the monitor from view. After a while, my eyes made their way back to the doors, and I watched a group of young professionals fight their way inside, each furiously sending emails with one hand and pushing with the other.
When I boarded the train, I was not aware that I was going to die that day. Yet there was no denying that the pressure of the air around me was different as I made my way to the station. Perhaps it was the fact that it was the first rainy day of April in D.C. and I was feeling nostalgic. Or maybe it was simply the fact that I was going home from work unusually early. Whatever it was, I could feel it following me, tenderly breathing down the nape of my neck as I made my way to my seat.
“You can be so useless sometimes. You know that?”
My eyes pushed past the woman fast asleep next to me to the young couple seated across the aisle from us.
“I keep looking at you and thinking about how I could do so much better.”
The woman, dark-haired and wearing a neon pink raincoat, crossed her arms violently and turned to face the window. “I’m done talking to you.”
Upon hearing this, her partner, a muscular man in his early 30s wearing a Washington Nationals baseball cap and t-shirt, sighed and threw his face into his overly large hands. I felt a sense of guilt again — this time for allowing myself to intrude on what was clearly a private argument. After a moment, the man looked up and briefly glanced my way. He turned his baseball cap backward in frustration and then began staring blankly ahead.
“You can be so useless sometimes. You know that?”
“I keep looking at you and thinking that I could do so much better.”
The woman’s words ran through my mind like a load of laundry, spinning in a never-ending cycle.
“I never really thought you were the one for me anyways.”
A new but familiar voice rang in my head. Slowly, it drowned out the woman’s words, as the laundry cycle in my mind grew faster.
“I’m happy you’re breaking up with me. To be honest, I’m not sure why I even dated you.”
Soak.
“I mean I liked you, but I wouldn’t tell my parents about you or anything.”
Rinse.
“You’re so annoying.”
Spin.
“Look, I know you’ve been sad and all because you were sexually assaulted or whatever, but everyone has problems.”
Repeat.
Suddenly, I am standing outside of a once familiar apartment door, my short dark hair dripping from the rain outside. From behind the doorframe a tall brooding figure examines the drained expression on my face.
“I want to break up, Peter,” I let out.
The figure furrows their brow and rubs their temples. For a moment it allows its face to express weakness before quickly composing itself and sighing.
“I never really thought you were the one for me anyways,” it says nonchalantly.
I look at the figure with the vulnerability of a child. It’s July of the previous year, and I’m standing outside of my now ex-boyfriend’s apartment. I’m back to the day we broke up.
“I know that you might be hurt,” I begin. “It’s really not about you. I’ve just been going through,” I pause. “A lot.”
“This again? Look, I know you’ve been sad and all because you were sexually assaulted or whatever, but everyone has problems. My parents are getting a divorce.”
“This again?”
I feel a wound form in my heart. Painfully, I count the times that I had mentioned the sexual assault to Peter.
One.
Two.
Three times. I had only mentioned it to him three times, always in passing and never in detail. Three times. And somehow that was too much? I had never felt so insecure before.
“That topic is outside the scope of this breakup,” I finally respond. “Can we please just talk about —.”
“Step back, doors opening. When boarding, please move to the center of the car."
As the overhead announcement blared across the loudspeaker, I was jolted out of my memories and back to the metro car. I turned back to the young bickering couple across the aisle, but they had already made their way to the train door. Disappointed, I squinted towards the red LED monitor which now read “METRO CENTER.” Closing my eyes, I rested my head against the window once more. Four more stops to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dakzen, a new Thai restaurant in Somerville, aims to present the tastes and textures of authentic modern street food. The location is small and casual with only a handful of tightly packed tables. Diners are handed paper menus on clipboards upon arrival and order at the counter when they are ready. The bright yellow color scheme and the chopsticks-wielding hungry monster mascot (the universal spirit animal) contribute to a youthful and vibrant energy.
The restaurant’s name breaks down to “dak,” a term used to describe enjoying food so much that “eating” is not sufficient to describe the experience, and “zen,” meaning noodles. True to its name, noodles are at the heart of Dakzen. The soft opening menu features an array of street noodles, including “khao soi,” one of their specials. As with any soup noodle, the key is the broth, simmered on low for four to five hours to develop a creamy and complex blend of traditional Thai flavors — sweet coconut and umami bone broth cut with a consistent yet subtle spice.
This dish is also made unique by the mix of boiled wide egg noodles and crispy fried egg noodles. With a bit of both in each bite, each mouthful has a unique texture. The dish comes together with tender shredded chicken, pickled mustard greens, raw red onion, scallions, and a soft boiled egg. (Beware, the onion does come on strong.)
The khao soi is Dakzen at its best, but some of their other dishes do not quite live up to it. This includes the “hoi joh,” crab croquettes wrapped in fried tofu skin. The taste is reminiscent of pork meatballs — seasoned, but with minimal complexity. The flavor primarily comes from a sweet and sour sauce on the side. Crisp tofu skin lends itself well to the twist on a croquette, with water chestnut in the filling to diversify the texture even more, yet the end result does not amount to much more than a generic spring roll.
The “khao grapow” also stumbles in its execution. This dish is another of Dakzen’s specials: Spicy fried rice dish with minced meat and oyster sauce. While it comes with a choice of several meats or tofu, the menu recommends crispy pork belly and the addition of a fried egg. I took their advice.
Pork belly is by far the most interesting element of the dish. Some bites are chunks of pure delight with a hefty ratio of crispiness to chewiness and crackling bursts of flavor, but others are overcooked to the point of becoming tough and dry. Each piece is different, and this inconsistency makes the dish a gamble. The meat and white rice are bathed in a thick and savory oyster sauce with a spice that kicks you in the throat and is best tamed with rich Thai iced tea. The heat is to be anticipated, as the menu does have a warning of two whole chili pepper symbols with this dish. Overall, the khao grapow gave the impression that it had definite potential, but with its overcooked egg and inconsistent pork belly, it did not hit the mark.
All in all, Dakzen is a solid and affordable place to take a chance on new Thai cuisine. While there are some more familiar options like pad thai and tom yum soup, the menu and mission of the restaurant encourage culinary adventure. But to make the most of the experience, I would recommend heeding the name and choosing their noodles when deciding what to “dak.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 20, 2016, I exited my last final in Science Center B, ran back to Weld, stuffed one last pair of shoes in my overstuffed suitcase, and hurried to the Harvard Square T stop to catch the Red Line to South Station. Over the course of the next 48 hours, I would find myself in Miami, Frankfurt, and finally in my grandparents’ apartment in Alexandria, Egypt. Teta and Gido greeted us with nectarines and sweet guava fruits, which they had just bought fresh from the vendor who ran a shop right under the balcony in their apartment building. It was the first time my family had stepped foot on Egyptian land since we emigrated to Miami in 2001.
I didn’t remember Egypt at all. I was only three years old when we relocated. It came to me in dreams sometimes, through fractured images of crowded marketplaces selling hijabs and abayas, cold water on my small hands, washing the butter and honey off after stuffing my face with more feteer than my stomach could handle. But in a state of consciousness, the country was a story my parents told me to remind me that the palm-lined streets of Miami, no matter how reminiscent they were of our m0ther land, were not home — not really.
In 2000, when my parents decided that life in Egypt was not sustainable, they began their visa application, hoping to move to the United States. After a year of drawn-out paperwork and immense amounts of luck, we finally received our golden tickets. From there we didn’t waste any time. Within a week we had packed up our essentials and cleaned our apartment. We were, as Gloria Anzaldúa describes in her collection of essays and poetry “Borderlands/La Frontera,” turtles, carrying home on our backs. When we finally left for the airport, we simply locked the door behind us as though we’d be back after a long vacation. That “vacation” lasted 15 years.
When we finally came back to the apartment we left behind, it was like opening a time capsule. Besides the layer of dust that had settled on every surface, it looked exactly as it had on the day we left it. As I surveyed the apartment I had once called home, I found puzzle sets and card games that were presumably mine on the shelves of a bedroom that I had supposedly called my own. The bed was made, and remarkably well considering it had not been touched for over a decade. As I ran my hands along the spines of books my three-year-old self had collected, small dots of tears rolled down my face. I did not know the person who these objects belonged to. I didn’t remember her at all. She was me, and simultaneously not.
Throughout my time in Egypt, I was continuously confronted with moments like these — of a life I would have lived had my parents not been granted a visa. I met another version of myself. I saw the school she would have attended, met the cousins she would have befriended, walked palm-lined streets her parents would have permitted her to call home. And I came to realize very quickly the arbitrary nature of the identities I myself held: “Muslim-American,” “Arab,” “Black,” “justice-oriented,” “activist.” All the parts of me that are so central to who I am today may never have developed had we stayed. The people we build ourselves up to be depend so much on where we do that building and what raw materials are available to us in that endeavor.
I struggled, then, with the discomfort I felt in Egypt. Despite my parents’ insistence that this was the place our family originated from, the place we truly belonged, Egypt was still a foreign world for me. It belonged mostly to the other Salma. And my Arabic betrayed me. Any claim I made at Egyptian identity was automatically suspect when I could not remember the Arabic words for “freedom” or “hunger”. When I, in a moment of wishful thinking, attempted to lay claim to my Egyptian identity once and for all by proving to myself that I could, like any other Egyptian, drink water from the tap, my body betrayed me, too. Despite the arbitrary nature of identity, I had built a self in a different place, one that was not compatible with the home I was supposed to claim.
And yet, my brown skin, my Muslim prayers, and the syllables in my name disallow me from making the U.S. a home either. I am faced with rejection at every turn. There are no homes I can call my own.
I was introduced to Anzaldúa’s “Borderlands” this past summer in a moment of intense loss of home, both literal and metaphorical, and her writing served as salve on deep cuts. Her ability to live in the Borderland, the space in between, so confidently and with such wisdom has given me guidance, hope, and resilience. She has given me the language I need to understand my own narrative. I think, like her, I’ve been a turtle since the day we moved, endlessly carrying home with me. She writes to me: “I have no country, my homeland cast me out; yet all countries are mine.”
While Anzaldúa speaks to these experiences, she is five steps ahead of me in a process I’m still working through. I am still struggling to make sense of the parts of myself that do not fit together. I feel grief and heartbreak towards the destruction of one version of myself to make room for another. I resent migration for creating rifts in my family that do not feel reconcilable. Each day my inability to claim a home leaves me feeling lost and ungrounded, like a balloon that will float away. The Borderland is “una herida abierta,” an open wound, a “thin edge of barbed wire.”
I don’t have many answers, but Anzaldúa has given me some: There is no need to pick between countries, spaces or identities. The in-between world can be home, too. And the pain I feel here is valid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One in five students at Harvard could be in danger, according to a new study by Harvard Medical School Professor Cindy Hsin-Ju Liu. She and colleagues found that 20 percent of college students reported suicidal ideation — defined as thinking about, considering, or planning suicide — based on a national survey of over 65,000 undergrads. This is twice the rate of the general population.
Suicidal ideation was, unfortunately, just the tip of the iceberg: One in four students reported being diagnosed with or treated for a mental health disorder in the prior year, one in 10 reported having attempted suicide, and one in five reported self-injury. Mental health problems were more prevalent in some non-heterosexual and non-cisgender groups, prompting Liu to write of the urgent need for strategies to reduce student stress.
A bachelor’s degree does not fix these issues. The University of California surveyed graduate students across its 10 locations. Using a random stratified sampling of 13,400 students, they received over 5,000 responses. They found that 35 percent of students had symptoms of clinical depression, far higher than the general population. Students rated mental health as the highest priority for the administration to address, even above career development.
These studies clearly indicate that mental health must be taken more seriously on college campuses. As a member of the Harvard Chan Mental Health Student Alliance at the School of Public Health, I have seen improvements, but more must be done. Harvard should be a global leader in addressing student mental health, just as we are a global leader in academics.
Each of the last two years, MHSA has surveyed students to identify mental health problems. We then used the findings to recommend changes to the school. Our most recent survey, in Spring 2018, mirrored the national results: About 50 percent of Harvard Chan students reported poor to fair mental health. We also found high rates of negative experiences, such as feeling disrespected or overwhelmed. However, as budding social scientists, we know that extrapolating our findings is tenuous because of a low response rate (15 percent) and a self-selected sample.
Nevertheless, we made three recommendations. First, we recommend promoting a culture of wellness that prioritizes healthy habits. Over 70 percent of students reported having challenges in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It is difficult to put your wellbeing first when you are pulling all-nighters to finish papers or eating leftover pizza at 3 a.m. But these “rites of passage” can be harmful to mental and physical health and should be identified as such.
Our second recommendation is to hold open discussions with students about structural barriers and how to overcome them. We live in changing times. Previous support systems, such as chaplains, may no longer work. The school has offered innovative solutions to meet student needs, such as Let’s Talk and iHope. But less than half of students knew of them, according to our survey. (Are you aware?) Open forums would allow the school to hear directly from students and better adapt existing resources to meet students’ needs.
Finally, we recommend institutionalizing a mental health survey managed by the school. Harvard must take responsibility for measuring mental health needs, rather than relying on student-led surveys. Fortunately, there is a solution. Harvard University Health Services offers a mental health survey available at any Harvard school, if the dean, or department chair, approves it. However, only a few places have offered it. We urge every Harvard school to work with students to implement the HUHS survey and use the findings to create change.
Members of the Harvard community are starting to pay attention. The 2018 Harvard Presidential Task Force’s report on inclusion and belonging recommended adding resources to enhance mental health services. It was one of three high-impact recommendations. Moreover, MHSA has worked with the Chan School of Public Health’s administration to make changes. In response to our first survey, the school added a mental health professional to our Longwood Campus and supported our second survey. Finally, the Harvard Graduate Student Union is advocating for additional mental health resources as part of their union agreement.
These current efforts are promising, but more needs to be done. The research has found a large mental health burden in higher education. If you believe the adage, “you can’t manage what you don’t measure,” then a single survey across Harvard institutions would be a great start to design evidence-based interventions. Students need more mental health support. There are too many lives in danger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent attempt to better accommodate students whose class schedules overlap with Harvard University Dining Services’ lunch hours, HUDS announced that it would adjust its lunch hours by opening 30 minutes earlier on weekdays. The need for an altered lunch schedule became salient in light of the College’s new 2018-2019 schedule, which eliminates Harvard Time and features longer classes with 15-minute breaks between each. Despite allowing for more time to travel between the Yard and Harvard’s Allston campus, which is set to open in 2020, the new schedule overwhelmingly wreaked logistical havoc on the lives of students. Many were forced to opt between lunch and attending class. In light of student complaints, this development on the part of HUDS is a good first step towards restoring order to the lives of Harvard students.
While we appreciate and welcome the new change HUDS has made to the lunch schedule, this solution does not alleviate everyone’s problems. As students seek quick alternatives to skipping lunch altogether, the lines at Fly-By remain staggeringly long. Bagged lunches, while convenient for a time-pressed schedule, consistently do not provide enough sustenance for students who rely on them due to the time pressures of the new schedule. Extending meal hours by a half an hour does fix some students’ problems, but many remain unable to eat lunch. A better solution is needed. However, the onus should not be on HUDS to address the insufficiencies of the College’s new schedule.
Harvard needs to understand that its choices are not made in a vacuum — that they affect students’ lives and the operations of other University organizations. In addition to soliciting student input on future logistical changes to student life, such as the proposal to eliminate shopping week, the University should coordinate with other organizations to orchestrate these changes. If Harvard wants to sidestep student input on proposed changes, it should at the very least fully align all operations prior to the start of the school year to ensure that students’ qualities of life does not suffer.
For the time being, Harvard should collaborate with HUDS to ensure that all students have access to lunch. If the most the dining halls can do is open for lunch a half hour early, then Harvard and HUDS should consider more unconventional methods to facilitate student meals. For example, the University should consider expanding Fly-By, potentially to new locations, to combat the intensified frequency and long lines it has witnessed this school year. Not only would this alleviate foot traffic in the Memorial Hall basement location, but it would also allow for students whose classes are not near Memorial Hall to receive a quick dining solution in the midst of a jam-packed schedule.
Alternatively, Harvard should consider expanding its bagged lunch program by making the meals more nutritious and plentiful, so that students do not feel as though they need to supplement their HUDS-provided meal with snacks using their own money. A more innovative solution Harvard could explore is expanding the BoardPlus amount given to students. In this way, students can eat meals at one of the cafes across campus that accept BoardPlus. If the nearest dining hall is prohibitively difficult to reach in 15 minutes, students could use the cafes as an alternative.
Ultimately, we ask that as Harvard moves forward in instituting changes that affect the lives of its students, it thinks about these changes in a holistic manner rather than as isolated updates. In the meantime, we urge Harvard to continue proactively addressing student concerns with the new class schedule, primarily those related to meal access.

Following the release of the final report of the University's Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging last March, John S. Wilson, senior adviser and strategist to Harvard’s president, said he is working to implement the reports' recommendations — including assembling teams of faculty and developing a University-wide survey.
Former University President Drew G. Faust announced Wilson’s appointment in March, writing that he would serve as the “point person” for the implementation of the task force’s recommendations. Wilson says that over the past few months, he, along with several other faculty members, have been strategizing about putting the task force's recommendations into action.
Wilson said that one of his first steps in the implementation process was assembling a team of individuals from around the University. Among them are Vincent Brown, professor of History and African and African American Studies, and Mayra R. Rivera, Divinity School professor of religion and Latinx studies, who are overseeing the task force’s call for an interfaculty initiative on “identity, politics, and culture.”
In addition, Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji; Khalil G. Muhammad, Kennedy School professor of history, race, and public; and Sociology Professor Frank Dobbin are spearheading an additional interfaculty initiative on “higher education, inclusion and belonging, and organizational change.”
“Among the first things we set out to do was to establish who around Harvard University is already in this space, and there are many people, particularly in the schools, so we established a committee,” Wilson said.
Wilson noted that while the second interfaculty initiative is, “at a slightly earlier stage in terms of its formation,” the first one on identity, politics, and culture has been discussing methods by which the wide range initiatives focusing on these themes around the ‘University can potentially work together.
“They may remain decentralized, but they’re looking at ways in which a greater awareness of who’s doing what might create some new synergy,” he said.
Wilson said he and his teams are planning for the release of a University-wide survey intended to gather data about inclusion and belonging — one of the task force’s recommendations.
“That’s a little more complex because the timing is absolutely critical on that, and we are aware that there are several other major surveys going on this year,” Wilson said. The Association of American Universities will administer a survey about sexual assault and misconduct on campus to Harvard students in the spring.
He said that he is in “active conversations” with a committee led by Andrew D. Ho, an Education School professor, to administer the survey.
When it comes to implementing the University-wide report at each of Harvard’s 12 schools, Wilson said that the decentralization of Harvard, while often considered a disadvantage, also has benefits.
“A lot of this inclusion and belonging work or the pursuit on inclusive excellence ties to, is grounded in relationships,” Wilson said. “It’s logical that the relationships that have to be formed have to be formed in smaller communities first, and then you build up.”
Wilson said that he is soliciting strategic plans, a set of guidelines for each of Harvard’s 12 schools curated by each school’s dean. Those plans are slated to be submitted to Wilson at the end of October.
“We’re going to assess all of the separate plans, and then we’re going to look for common themes and figure out what an overall strategy has to be,” he said.
Wilson encouraged further input from students throughout the implementation process. He said he has spoken with Claudine Gay, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Katherine G. O’Dair, the College’s dean of students, and about how to best reach undergraduates.
Wilson and his team’s ultimate goal is to create a model for inclusion and belonging in a university setting, he said.
“If we can get this right, if Harvard can be the model for inclusion and belonging issues and for what inclusive excellence means in higher education or in any sophisticated organization, that would be a good thing. That’s the goal,” Wilson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will once again join colleges and universities across the country in conducting a campus climate survey on sexual assault and sexual misconduct next spring — four years after it first administered the questionnaire in 2015 and found that 31 percent of female undergraduate seniors had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact.”
The 2015 survey results, which former University President Drew G. Faust called “troubling,” prompted Harvard to reform its approach to preventing sexual misconduct and handling these cases when they do occur.
Four years later, Harvard is now preparing to undertake the survey for the second time. The Association of American Universities — which administers the survey — announced Thursday that Harvard would be one of 33 schools participating. The AAU will administer the survey during a currently unspecified time period in spring 2019.
The second installment of the survey will take place as Harvard — and the country – undergo a reckoning over sexual misconduct allegations brought about by the #MeToo movement. The announcement by the AAU comes amid national turmoil surrounding the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, who at least two women have accused of sexual assault.
The survey also comes in the wake of a tumultuous year at Harvard; sexual misconduct allegations against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez and Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer surfaced last spring. The University is currently investigating those claims, while facing three ongoing federal investigations into its compliance with Title IX, the anti-sex discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s approach to sexual misconduct.
Apart from the national climate, much has changed at Harvard since the AAU first administered the survey in 2015. The University has grown its administrative branch charged with Title IX compliance. Harvard now employs more than 50 Title IX coordinators up from 35 in 2014, and the University’s central Title IX office was split in two to better distinguish its investigative unit from its training and resources.
Harvard’s central Title IX Office has also launching a number of new initiatives this semester, according to University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill. The office is working to administer mandatory faculty and staff online trainings and a new bystander training program currently in its pilot stage, among other measures.
When the original sexual assault climate survey was first completed in 2015, the results prompted Faust to convene a task force dedicated to devising recommendations for sexual assault prevention and a committee charged with reviewing Harvard’s Title IX policy.
The task force released a report in 2016 detailing numerous recommendations for changes to school practices. The committee’s work is ongoing.
The results of the 2015 survey found that 31 percent of female undergraduate seniors at the time had experienced “nonconsensual sexual contact.” Sixteen percent of female seniors reported they had experienced sexual penetration or attempted penetration without their consent during that time.
Merhill said that participating in the survey again is a way to compare the school’s climate to 2015.
“The intent was to to administer again with AAU during the next survey cycle so that we can gather comparative data on the progress that we’ve made and what programming is needed and how to continue our efforts in addressing this issue,” she said.
Regular surveying was one of the sexual assault prevention task force’s recommendations in 2016. Merhill said the four-year gap between the surveys is based on best practices for survey administration and administrators’ desire to prevent survey fatigue and allow for the results to reflect the impacts of new initiatives.
Even though this survey only takes place every four years, Merhill said there are many ways the school continuously collects data on the school’s sexual climate and the efficacy of its programs. These methods include tracking the Title IX website’s analytics to see which resources visitors utilize the most, conducting focus groups for new initiatives, and collecting feedback on online training modules and other programs.
“There’s ongoing data collection in all of the practices that we engage in across the University,” Merhill said. “The climate survey is one piece of that puzzle that’s critically important.”
In addition to the climate survey, the Title IX office is also rolling out a mandatory online training module for staff and faculty this fall, Merhill said. University administrators announced the program — which is still in its final stages of development — in May. There is no date set yet for its release, and Merhill said she doesn’t know at this point how administrators will make the modules mandatory for faculty.
The College instituted its first-ever mandatory Title IX training this year, reaching a 100 percent completion rate among degree-seeking undergraduates enrolled for the fall semester. By tying module completion to the ability for students to enroll in classes, the revised training saw a large jump from last year’s 71 percent completion rate.
Merhill said the Title IX Office is also piloting a new voluntary bystander intervention training meant to teach participants how to recognize and respond to harassment.
“This customizable, in-person workshop will examine the roles of power, privilege, and peer influence across an array of social, academic, and professional contexts,” Merhill said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since assuming the deanship of Harvard’s flagship faculty, Claudine Gay has visited biology labs filled with contaminated materials, released a comprehensive annual report of the University’s largest unit, and started planning a party for the entire faculty — all in just the first six weeks since she’s taken office.
Gay, who had previously served as dean of social science, took office on Aug. 15, replacing Michael D. Smith who served for 11 years as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Smith announced in March that he planned to resign as soon as recently appointed University President Lawrence S. Bacow found his replacement.
As FAS dean, Gay oversees more than 700 faculty members, including professors at the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Division of Continuing Education. She is the first woman and the first person of color to hold the position.
Gay said that she spent much of her first few weeks walking around FAS and talking to different people.
“My motivation has been, if I can understand the people and where they're coming from, and what their aspirations are, that my priorities will kind of emerge organically out of those conversations,” Gay said.
These conversations have ranged in topic from surface archaeology to the mathematical formula that describes tying a ribbon around a donut, she said.
One of her conversations brought Gay to the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, where she toured the lab of a faculty member, who warned her not to touch anything at the start of their meeting.
“For the next 10 minutes while we stood in that lab, and he was just in a very relaxed tone and matter of fact and chatting away, I literally was just frozen,” Gay said with a laugh. “But that was a lot of fun.”
Beyond the lab, however, Gay said she’s embraced the freedom of dropping in to learn about people across FAS and their work in her new role.
“I'm being exposed to all sorts of pockets of energy and innovation that I didn't know existed and yet they're really important to contribute to what is overall really vibrant on campus,” Gay said.
Gay praised her predecessor, Smith, and said she thinks they are both “data-driven” in their decision making processes. Gay also added that through her years of working with Smith, she’s learned from him to recognize the pros and cons in every decision.
“We acknowledge that a tradeoff is being made and that some people will be unhappy,” Gay said. “And I feel like that's something that Mike was always unafraid to do and in my three years working with him, I feel like I've built up my confidence and ability to do that as well.”
Like Smith, Gay intends to continue developing the tenure track and providing support for junior faculty members.
“I feel like we've made very important practices on that front especially around strengthening our practice around mentoring and also kind of just more professional development but I know we can always go further,” Gay said. “That's something that was important to me in my role as social science dean and will remain important to me going forward.”
Although Gay said she shares many similarities with Smith, she was also quick to point out a key difference —  her appreciation for parties. As the former dean of social science, Gay would throw semesterly parties for all the faculty members in the division, which she said she always loved doing. Gay said she hopes to plan a party for all the faculty members in the spring.
“I might like parties more than Mike,” Gay said. “I haven't been able to get myself organized enough to plan one for the entire faculty this semester, but I want to do one in the spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some experts say the parallel federal probes into the admissions practices of Harvard and Yale — both investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants — indicate the Trump administration is preparing to launch future attacks against affirmative action programs at universities across the country.
Yale University President Peter Salovey confirmed Sept. 26 that the school is facing a Department of Justice and Department of Education investigation. Harvard has faced a similar investigation from the Justice Department for roughly a year.
Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at the University of North Carolina, said the investigations into both universities show the federal government is “trying to expand the scope and breadth” of their challenge to affirmative action policies.
“They won’t stop here. They can set a good precedent, from their perspective,” Shaw said.
Vinay Harpalani, a professor at Savannah Law School, agreed with Shaw and said the Trump administration might pursue further inquiries into other institutions to promote its political goals.
“The U.S. could put more resources, open up more investigations,” Harpalani said. “I think it’s part of a more broader political strategy, political movement by the Trump administration to promote those lawsuits, try to eliminate the use of race in college admissions.”
The Justice Department’s investigation into Harvard began in August 2017 as a response to a 2015 discrimination complaint filed by 64 Asian American groups led by the Asian American Coalition for Education. The complaint alleged Harvard held Asian American applicants to higher admissions standards than students of other races.
The Yale investigation, which began in April 2018, is based on a similar complaint filed by AACE with 132 other Asian American groups in 2016.
Both complaints were filed with the civil rights offices of the Justice Department and Education Department — which were then under the supervision of the Obama administration. At the time, the Education Department dismissed the complaint against Harvard, while the Justice Department took no action. Neither department took action on the complaint against Yale, which also implicated Brown and Dartmouth.
Over the past year — and under a new presidential administration — the federal government chose to pursue both complaints.
The two ongoing investigations represent only a portion of the federal government’s challenges to affirmative action. In July, the Trump administration rolled back Obama-era guidelines on race-conscious admissions policies.
In August, the Justice Department directly criticized Harvard’s policies as part of a separate lawsuit, which an anti-affirmative action group brought against the University in 2014. In a memo to the judge presiding over the case, the Department of Justice wrote that it feared the College’s admissions process may be “infected with racial bias.”
Roger Clegg, who served as deputy assistant attorney general of the civil rights division of the Justice Department under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said affirmative action opponents — bolstered by the Trump administration’s actions — are likely to file more complaints against universities.
“Once it becomes clear that the administration is interested and willing to investigate these matters, then I think more complaints will be filed, and there will be more investigations,” Clegg said.
David B. Oppenheimer, a law professor at University of California, Berkeley, also said he believes further investigations are likely in the future.
“I assume that as long as President Trump is president, and Attorney General [Jeff] Sessions is attorney general, that we will see an increase in number of challenges through investigation, through litigation, and through administrative action against university affirmative action programs,” Oppenheimer said.
Harpalani agreed that, with the addition of the Yale investigation, many institutions of higher education may re-evaluate the use of race in their admissions policies.
“Ultimately, maybe what it could do is pressure other universities to reduce their reliance on race or stop using race altogether. That’s probably more the target of the Yale investigation specifically,” Harpalani said.
While Harpalani said the Yale investigation has the potential to affect other universities, Clegg also said the investigation will make an impact at the institution the Department of Justice first examined: Harvard.
“I’m sure that what the lawyers and government agencies have learned in respect to Harvard will be useful to what they do with Yale and vice versa. As they learn things in the course of the Yale investigation, that [information] might be useful in respect to Harvard,” Clegg said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of on-campus disciplinary actions nearly doubled in 2017 from the previous year, according to Harvard University Police Department’s annual security report released  Monday.
According to the 2017 report, there were 33 reported on-campus rapes and 47 reported cases of on-campus burglaries. The 47 burglary reports represents a significant decrease from 70 reported cases in 2016. HUPD reported 27 and 34 cases of on-campus rapes in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano announced the report’s release — which was accompanied by the University’s annual fire safety report — in an email to University affiliates on Oct. 1.
While there were no on-campus arrests last year, there were 56 cases of on-campus disciplinary action, up from 33 in 2016. Offenses include weapons violations, drug law violations, and alcohol law violations. The 2017 spike in enforcement comes primarily from an increase in drug and alcohol law violations, which increased from 32 to 56 from 2016 to 2017.
The annual security report, titled “Playing it Safe,” is published by HUPD and includes “information about the HUPD, how to report a crime, HUPD’s crime prevention programs, substance abuse, sensitive crimes, emergency notifications, and other important information about security and HUPD services on campus,” Catalano wrote.
The report outlines various crime awareness tips, guidelines for reporting crimes to HUPD, and information on the University’s crime policies, which encompasses hate crimes, harassment, drug and alcohol offenses, and missing persons.
Consistent with last year’s previous report, there is a stark difference in the crime rates between Harvard’s Longwood and Cambridge campuses. While the Longwood Medical Area campus in Boston only saw 5 total criminal offenses in 2017, the Cambridge campus saw 191.
The University Environmental Health and Safety Department publishes the annual fire safety report, which was also released on Monday. This report includes fire safety polices, evacuation procedures, and fire statistics.
According to the data released in the fire safety report, no fires occurred in Harvard undergraduate dorms in 2017. However, the report detailed two small fires that occured in Harvard University housing, which is largely inhabited by graduate students and researchers.
The fire safety report also outlines various fire safety training techniques, resources for students, as well as data showing the fire safety measures installed in each one of Harvard’s buildings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of criticism over a lack of diversity at the Harvard Kennedy School, the school has begun “unconscious bias and micro-messaging” training for senior administrators, school leaders said in an interview Tuesday.
The Kennedy School also plans to issue a second report on the status of diversity initiatives at HKS; the first report was released in May 2017 by the school’s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion, a group of students, staff, and faculty that gathered data about minorities at the school and presented a list of recommendations to Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf.
The data indicated trends that sparked much student activism and conversation surrounding diversity at the school. The draft report showed a steady decline of African American, “Hispanic-American” and Asian students at HKS within its largest degree program — the two-year Masters in Public Policy program — between 2005 and 2015.
The report revealed similar trends among minorities at the faculty and staff level, especially those who had received tenure or a senior administrative position. According to the report, HKS had only two tenured African American professors and two tenured professors who were classified as “Hispanic” out of 55 total professors in 2017.
The Kennedy School also saw a number of high-profile departures of women of color at senior administrative levels; one woman, former assistant dean for diversity and inclusion, Alexandra Martinez, specifically cited the “lack of support” she received from other school leaders as the reason for her exit.
One of the main recommendations of the task force report called on the school to hire an “associate dean for diversity, inclusion, and belonging.” After an eight-month search process, the school hired Robbin Chapman, who assumed the role in April 2018. Chapman has begun meeting with senior staff, leaders of the school’s various research centers, and students.
“A part of what Robbin has done so wonderfully is to work with everyone around the school, and the whole leadership team is very committed to working with Robbin,” Elmendorf said.
Another recommendation of the task force was to regularly collect and analyze demographic information about Kennedy School affiliates in order to mark progress. Elmendorf said another report will come out next week.
“This report is meant to have the framework for presenting information that we hope to use in future years as well,” Elmendorf said. “We've been busy.”
Chapman has begun to run trainings with senior leaders, department heads, and directors of the 11 research centers at HKS. These trainings — centered around topics like unconscious bias — require participants to complete homework in preparation for future sessions to “understand how to better support the community as it begins its learning,” Chapman said.
“Whatever learning that we have the expectation for the community to be involved in as part of their being able to contribute to making the Kennedy School more diverse, inclusive and belonging, is first understood and undertaken by senior leadership,” Chapman said.
The training has also been extended to several “student-facing” departments or roles, including faculty assistants and degree program directors, according to Chapman.
Chapman also addressed how admissions affects the diversity of the Kennedy School — a point raised in the first task force report. According to the report, from 2005 to 2015, the yield rate of African American students dropped from 85 to 66 percent. For students who identified as Latinx, the yield dropped 92 to 71 percent in 2015. Asians saw their yield rate increase from 67 percent in 2005 to 77 percent to 2015.
Chapman said she has been “working very closely” with the admissions office; she has met twice thus far with the entire staff.
“We are focused on outreach,” Chapman said. “What is our footprint, where are we known to be, and where are we not known to be and how do either redistribute — what do we do strategically around that.”
Elmendorf said in order to remove bias from the hiring and recruitment process, the school has started developing “new guidelines” for faculty search committees to “ensure they are casting the widest possible net” to find people interested in joining the faculty.
“One of the things that we're really focusing on as well is developing and growing the additional networks, or the wider networks that will give us the kind of footprint we need to have with the groups that we are interested in, the talent we want to attract,” Chapman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lofting signs and bellowing chants, members of the Harvard International Socialists rallied in Harvard Yard Thursday afternoon to protest the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court — continuing a string of demonstrations against the judge at Harvard over the past week.
The anti-Kavanaugh “speak out” was part of a nationwide day of action organized to oppose the embattled nominee.
The rally was the Harvard Socialists’ second event protesting Kavanaugh’s nomination; last week, around 35 members of the group rallied in the same location. Sasha E. Scott — a Harvard Socialists member who organized Thursday’s rally — said the group chose to demonstrate again to make sure Harvard affiliates had a way to participate in the nationwide action.
“We wanted to, in solidarity with all the people who are protesting across the country, give people an opportunity to protest here at Harvard, too,” Scott said.
President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh in July to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. The judge’s confirmation seemed all but certain until roughly three weeks ago, when women began to come forward with allegations that he had sexually assaulted them decades ago.
First, Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh had forced her onto a bed, pressed his body to hers, and tried to take off her clothes at a party the two attended in the 1980s, when both were enrolled in private D.C.-area high schools. Just a few days later, another woman — Deborah Ramirez — told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while students at Yale. Then, a third woman, Julie Swetnick, said in a sworn affidavit that Kavanaugh was present while a group of teenage boys drugged and raped her at a D.C.-area party in 1982.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly and unequivocally denied all three allegations in the press and in a high-stakes and nationally televised hearing last week. The F.B.I. concluded an investigation into the allegations this week, and senators plan to vote on Kavanaugh’s confirmation on Friday or Saturday.
At the Harvard rally Thursday, around 100 people crowded around the steps of University Hall to listen to students and Boston-area locals give speeches and lead chants through a megaphone. Some onlookers shook noisemakers and banged a tambourine. Speakers often competed with the sounds of rehearsals for University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s upcoming inauguration.
While Scott railed against the “vile racism, sexism, and transphobia” she believes politicians have displayed during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process, the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum practiced its rendition of “America the Beautiful” for the inauguration. The song filtered over the protest via speakers set up throughout the Yard.
Kavanaugh has taught at Harvard Law School for nearly a decade. After weeks of student outcry over his continued employment, The Crimson reported on Monday that he will not return to teach his usual course at the Law School, a three-week-long course held in January titled “The Supreme Court Since 2005.” On Tuesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow confirmed that Kavanaugh decided on his own to leave his position.
Law School student Samantha E. Rodriguez said she believes the pressure that students have been placing on Kavanaugh contributed to his decision to depart HLS.
“It was the vast number of emails that he was getting, the calls he was getting — from not only folks that go to the school, from people all over the country,” Rodriguez said. “They’re outraged.”
“I think it exactly, for me, really shows the importance of really organizing and making our voices heard,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the U.S. Senate prepares for a showdown vote on Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court, two Harvard alumni traveled from New York City on Thursday to hand-deliver a petition condemning the nominee to the D.C. office of Sen. Ben E. Sasse ’94 (R-Neb.).
The petition calls on Sasse to vote “no” on Kavanaugh, urging him to “demonstrate the bravery and commitment to the American democratic principles you have so often celebrated on the Senate Judiciary Committee.” The two alumni — Allison A. Hill-Edgar ’94 and Melissa A. Bender ’94 — graduated from Harvard in 1994, the same year Sasse did.
“If you vote in support [of] Judge Kavanaugh, it is a political choice about the meaning of the constitution and our vision of democracy; a choice that will have real consequences for real people,” reads the petition, available online and signed by roughly 350 Harvard affiliates as of Thursday evening.
At least two women have stepped forward in recent weeks to accuse Kavanaugh — whom President Donald Trump nominated to sit on the nation’s highest court over the summer — of sexual assault perpetrated decades ago. The FBI completed an investigation into the women’s allegations late Wednesday, allowing the Senate to proceed with a vote.
It is unclear what the outcome of that vote will be; the Senate has split over Kavanaugh along partisan lines, with most Republicans vowing to support the conservative judge while Democrats promise to oppose him. The votes cast by four key undecided senators — Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) — will likely determine Kavanaugh’s fate. Sasse, who hails from a deep-red state, is all but certain to vote for the embattled nominee.
Bender said she and Hill-Edgar were unable to meet with Sasse in person Thursday, though staffers in his office took the printed-out petition. The two women said Sasse’s staff told them the senator had left D.C. for a “family commitment” earlier in the morning.
“They kindly accepted the petition but said, ‘No, sorry,’” Bender said.
After the two women waited around D.C. for several hours, Bender said, one of Sasse’s staffers agreed to meet with them. But the staffer was unable to offer any response to the petition on the senator’s behalf, the women said.
Sasse’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Hill-Edgar and Bender said they were willing to make the hours-long trip from New York to Capitol Hill because the issues raised by Kavanaugh’s possible confirmation are crucial — not only to them personally, but to women across the nation.
“This is a really historic moment where the Senate could serve as a model for the world of showing people what this powerful body of men does when women come forward,” Bender said in an interview Thursday. “And if women come forward and nothing happens, there’s no consequences, then what does this say for certain individuals in this country and for people all over the world?”
“This was really important to us,” Hill-Edgar said.
Aren R. Cohen ’94, who helped organize the petition to Sasse, said she, Hill-Edgar, and Bender repeatedly tried to coordinate a meeting with Sasse by emailing and sending LinkedIn messages to his staffers throughout the day Wednesday and Thursday.
Eventually, Cohen said, she received a response from Tyler Grassmeyer, Sasse’s deputy chief of staff: Grassmeyer wrote that the senator would have to decline a meeting.
“The reality of it is that it was incredibly short notice,” Cohen said, adding that she thought Sasse’s office was on the whole “very considerate.”
Hill-Edgar said she hopes the fact that she and Bender hand-delivered the petition to Sasse’s office might spur the senator to actually read it “instead of it just being a stack of papers that he ignores.”
“We’ll just have to see what will happen,” Hill-Edgar said. “I’m very much hoping that people will think about this outside of just picking along their traditional party lines.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched a survey Thursday that will assess the culture of the Government Department — a survey the department vowed to undertake following allegations of sexual assault against a prominent Government professor that roiled campus last semester.
The survey, which will remain open from Oct. 4 to Oct. 18, includes questions asking whether affiliates feel included, whether they have experienced harassment, and how they would rate their professional well-being. All responses will remain anonymous.
“We’re just trying to understand more about the climate of the Government Department, and what people’s concerns are, and what their particular experiences are with issues like harassment and discrimination and understand what the levels of those are in the department,” said Ryan D. Enos, an associate professor of Government who is helping lead the survey.
Though it will be administered through the University’s Office of Institutional Research, the survey is the brainchild of the Government Department’s Climate Change Committee, which administrators formed in March 2018 after at least 18 women stepped forward to accuse Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment that spanned nearly four decades.
It was not the first time Dominguez had been accused of sexual misconduct — after women came forward with similar allegations in the 1980s, administrators slapped sanctions on the professor. But he was allowed to remain at Harvard and ultimately rose through the ranks to hold ever-higher positions of administrative power. After the 18 women spoke up this year, many department affiliates said they were frustrated Harvard had allowed Dominguez to remain on campus for decades.
At the time of its creation, administrators tasked the committee with understanding how the “Dominguez situation” came to be — and with addressing concerns over “inappropriate power dynamics” and “gendered interactions” in the Government department. The 15-member committee, which includes faculty, staff, and students, released a preliminary report over the summer outlining agendas for each of its seven subcommittees.
One of the agenda items comprised a climate survey that the “inclusive climate” subcommittee will use to conduct a “review of the department’s performance on issues of sexual harassment,” according to the summer report.
Enos, who chairs the inclusive climate subcommittee, said in an interview Thursday that the group will produce an initial report based on the survey results and will deliver it to faculty members by Oct. 23.
Though Enos said he does not yet have an exact timeline, he said the full report will be released to the general public by the “end of October.”
In addition to questions on the general climate of the Government Department, the survey asks respondents for a variety of demographic details including their gender, political affiliation, and whether respondents identify as racial minorities.
Enos said that OIR — and not members of the Government Department committee — will handle and analyze all data collected. Enos and his fellow subcommittee members will examine only the finalized OIR report, though they can request certain kinds of analysis from the University’s research arm.
“We don’t ever touch the data, and we have no way to identify individuals that way because we don’t see the individual data,” Enos said. “We have no plans to censor any of the data.”
Enos said he hopes for a high response rate from Government affiliates. He said a larger number of replies will assist the committee and the department in making future reforms.
“The more people that take it, the better data we have,” Enos said. “The better data we get, the more we can accurately reflect on what [the data is] and the more we can do on it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a win against Yale in its first conference matchup, the Harvard men’s soccer team (3-6-0, 1-0 Ivy) is looking to nab another victory in its next Ivy League contest against Cornell (7-2-0, 1-0) this Saturday.
“Every game is [like] a final in the Ivy League,” junior midfielder Taner Dogan said. “And that’s exactly what we want.”
Harvard certainly brought that mentality to the match against Yale last week. Despite starting the game on its heels, the Crimson jumped ahead with a 59th minute goal netted by freshman forward Alfred Perez and didn’t look back, securing a one-nil victory at full time.
The shutout victory against the Bulldogs extended Harvard’s win streak against its archrival to five games and was the Crimson’s first clean sheet of the season. This marked a significant defensive improvement over the first seven games of the season in which Harvard allowed an Ivy League high of 19 goals. And the turnaround could not have come at a better time. With the home win versus Yale, and another victory at home against Boston University in the game before, the Crimson snapped a four-game losing streak.
Freshman Havard Hjermstad credited the defensive success to the formation changes that new additions to the coaching staff implemented this year.
“We’re playing a new formation this year, and it takes time to adapt to the new formation, but we’re taking steps each game,” Hjermstad said. “We’re doing our thing and staying loyal to the plan given by coach.”
The Harvard squad will have to keep that defensive prowess rolling against a rather formidable opponent this weekend. The Big Red has the best overall record in the Ancient Eight, and is currently ranked 25th in the country, the highest ranked Ivy League team on the NCAA list.
Cornell is also coming off a 1-0 shutout victory against Penn in its first Ivy League win. That victory prolonged what has become a four-game win streak for the Big Red, with alternating home and road contests.
Cornell’s high-powered offense has put up 18 goals this season, leading the Ivy League by a long shot. The offense has been led by freshman midfielder Emeka Eneli, who has put up a goal in five of the Big Red’s nine contests this season, a team high.
When Harvard matched up with Cornell last year in Ithaca, the game was a nail-biter. If not for a ninth-minute goal scored by George Pedlow, a forward hailing from London, England, the game very well might have ended drawn, as the remaining 81 minutes were scoreless. Pedlow, now a junior, is another player on Cornell’s team to watch. He has found the net three times this season, putting him behind Eneli with the second most goals scored on the team.
On the Harvard side, senior forward Cesar Farias Jr., Perez, and Dogan have been leading the offense with two goals apiece. Additionally, sophomore midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso has recorded three assists on the year. After dropping an excruciatingly close 1-0 contest to New Hampshire on the road, these players are hoping to lead the team to a bounce-back victory on home turf.
Jordan Field has seemed to electrify Harvard this season. The team has an 0-5 record in away games this year but is sitting at 3-1 at home.
“We’ve played a lot of really good teams away from home, which has definitely influenced it,” Hjermstad said. “Of course, it’s always nice to play home where you have your own fans and you’re on a field that you’re used to.”
Adding to the significance of this particular matchup is that it is being played during alumni weekend.
"There will also be a lot more support from alums of the program,” commented Dogan. “We’re excited to play in front of them.”
All in all, an Ivy League matchup on alumni weekend makes for a meaningful game for the Crimson unit. As Dogan said, “With that attitude, it brings intense games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two.
That’s the number of games Harvard has played since its last Saturday contest. The number of games Harvard has played since playing under the sun. The number of consecutive years Harvard will have traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., to challenge Cornell at its home Schoellkopf Field.
Two is a significant number for other reasons too. Last year, the Big Red was the Crimson’s second loss. This year — with Harvard (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) entering the grudge match on the heels of its first loss of the season to Rhode Island — history could repeat itself.
A loss this weekend would be the second divisional defeat for Cornell (1-2, 0-1). In the Ivy League, two losses is for all intents and purposes the kiss of death. A team with two or more in the loss column hasn’t so much as shared the Ancient Eight crown since 1982, and that was only one of two such instances since the formation of the Ivy League.
The Crimson’s rushing defense bucks the two trend, ranking number one in the nation allowing an average of just 50.0 yards on the ground per game. If you extrapolated that out to yards per carry, opponents average just 2.1 each snap.
“Those guys up front are absolute beasts,” captain safety Zach Miller said. “Those guys set the tone. When we can control the line of scrimmage like they do, and absolutely dominate, it makes everybody else in the second level and third level’s job easier. It forces them to play left-handed because this team’s going to want to run the ball. If we can stop the run...then we get them passing and that’s great for us.”
Leading the defensive front is senior Richie Ryan with 2.5 sacks, senior Wes Ogsbury with two interceptions and sophomore Jordan Hill with 19 tackles.
And it is at the line of the scrimmage, with the Big Red in possession and Harvard on the defense, that this weekend’s game is likely to be won or lost. Cornell enters the afternoon tilt averaging 165.7 rushing yards and 155.3 passing yards per match — by all means a balanced offensive attack.
The Crimson doesn’t think the Big Red will come out so balanced on Saturday.
“We’re expecting them to run the ball 60 times,” Miller said. “So we’re going to have to bring it up front, especially going down there to Cornell. They’re going to be juiced in Ithaca.”
If past precedent is any indication, Miller will likely be proved correct. When the two squads met at Schoellkopf Field in 2017, the Big Red put the ball on the ground 59 times. The strategy was ultimately successful, earning Cornell its first win in the series in 11 seasons. Cue the obligatory quote about fixing things that aren’t broken.
Last year’s win invigorated the team from Ithaca, as it went on to win the next two consecutive divisional matches and pushing itself into Ancient Eight title contention in November for the first time since 2000.
Harvard’s defensive line isn’t the only strong facet of the team. Senior wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley is tearing up defenses. The senior currently leads the conference in receptions per game (7.7) and all-purpose yards per game (132.0). The performance is historically significant as well, ranking third in program history for career receptions (147) and fifth in reception yards (1,894).
While the Smith to Shelton-Mosley connection has earned the Crimson yards through the air, coach Tim Murphy will tell you a good pass game is predicated on a team’s ability to run the ball. Harvard has that ability. One of the three sophomore running backs taking snaps, Aaron Shampklin leads the conference in rushing with 112.0 yards per game.
Overall the visiting team — like the Big Red — is very balanced with an average of 210.0 yards through the air and 201.3 rushing yards per game.
“We have a lot of run-pass option in our offense this year,” senior half back Jack Stansell said. “On any given play, a running back could be getting the ball, a wide receiver could be getting the ball, a tight end could be getting the ball or a quarterback could have the option to run. Having those different options will help you pass the ball and run the ball effectively.”
But this isn’t the Cornell team of years past, back when the Crimson could essentially sort this match into the win column before the season had even started.
Last week, the Big Red won its first game of the season. The team didn’t just win, it trashed Sacred Heart — an unbeaten Sacred Heart team. Prior to last week’s matchup, The Pioneers had allowed exactly 34 points total in their preceding three games. Cornell scored 36 in the first half. It was the Big Red’s first win ever in the series.
“It’s always tough...whenever you play Cornell,” Murphy said. “Always tough...up in Ithaca. We have a small sample size to gauge where they are right now. They had a very tight game with Yale, they had a relatively tight game with Delaware and then they blew out a good NEC team team. They certainly have our attention.”
The team’s offense is led by junior running back Harold Coles. Averaging 7.8 yards per carry, the back has 217 yards on the season. Defensively, the team boasts eight players that have double figure tackle counts, with junior Jelani Taylor leading the crew having put 21 people on the turf.
For this perennial underdog, a real point of pride has been the special team core. After last week’s thrashing of Sacred Heart, the Ivy League honored junior David Jones with the division’s Defensive Player of the Week award. Jones intercepted two passes, taking one all the way back for six and returning a kick for a touchdown as well.
In Harvard’s loss to Rhode Island, the team’s only points of the second half came on a 97-yard kickoff return for touchdown. The six-point play ultimately determined the game as the Crimson lost by seven.
Saturday’s game will be the most recent rendition of a long and storied series. The match will be the two squads’ 83rd game. Harvard leads the series 47-33-2, but the Big Red’s win is still fresh in the minds of the Crimson.
“We’re out for revenge, we’re out for blood this year,” Miller said. “Espcially because they sucker punched us last year, and played a really good hard-fought game against us and they came out with the win. I definitely think we’re a little pissed off and we’re ready for revenge.”

October 7th is National Frappe Day, so we’ve selected our four favorite frappe recipes to observe the holiday. All the portions below are what we recommend for a venti size — because go big or go home.
Cinnamon Toast Crunch 
This taste-alike frappe takes us back to the good old days of Sunday morning cartoons and sugary breakfasts. Start with a white mocha base, add two pumps of cinnamon dolce syrup, ask for cinnamon sugar to be blended in, top with whipped cream, and sprinkle even more cinnamon sugar on top. Breakfast really is the most important meal of the day.
Piña Colada
Did somebody say spring break? Transport yourself to any tropical destination with this crème frappe. Just ask for coconut milk filled to the first line, pineapple juice filled to the second line, add three scoops of vanilla bean powder, and pump one and a half squirts of both classic and vanilla syrup. You didn’t even have to pay for a flight to go on this vacay.
Chocolate-Covered Banana
Banana and chocolate have always been a dynamic duo, but put them in a frappe, and suddenly it’s a whole new world. This vanilla bean frappe (with three less scoops of vanilla bean powder) is totally transformed when you line the cup with a mocha drizzle, add a banana, splurge for java chips, and obviously top it with whip cream. This has fruit in it, so it’s healthy, right?
Chunky Monkey
It may be cuffing season, but the only men we need in our lives are Ben and Jerry. Order a crème frappe, blend in a banana, add two scoops of vanilla bean powder, pump two squirts of mocha syrup, hazelnut syrup, and toffee nut syrup, and garnish with a light caramel drizzle. Dating’s never been this sweet and easy.
*Pro-Tip: Use the Starbucks mobile app to skip the lines and earn delicious points with every purchase.
Don’t worry, be frappe-y, and a happy National Frappe Day to you!

Happy October! In case it has escaped your notice, we finally have our first three-day weekend! An extra day off should give you all the more reason to put down your books for a second and hit the streets of Boston! It’s okay — go ahead and procrastinate a little bit...this weekend you can just suffer from the Monday scaries instead of the Sunday scaries (or not, if you want to hit up the featured Monday event!). In the meantime, though, check out the best of Boston happenings this weekend!
Friday:
SoWa First Friday
Have you heard of SoWa, the arts district in South Boston? Every first Friday (which is this Friday!), from 5 to 9 p.m., the shops and galleries of SoWa open their doors to the public. You can shop in cute boutiques, meet the artisans who make the whole thing happen, and round the evening off with a fancy dinner at one of the restaurants in the district. Everything in SoWa is within walking distance, so once you get there on the T, your feet will take you everywhere you need to go.
Saturday:
Chocolate Tasting @ George Howell
If you’re here for chocolate, specifically free chocolate, then you’ll want to stop by George Howell Coffee between 3 and 4 p.m. this Saturday. They will have chocolate from local chocolatiers on display, featuring cocoa from around the world. This Saturday, learn more about your favorite treat in the best way possible: by eating it.
Sunday:
Greenway Open Market
If you’re a SoWa veteran looking to check out something new, head to Greenway this Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. At the Greenway Market, you can find art, local products, fountains, food trucks, and, if you’re lucky, maybe even some sunshine! To turn your jaunt into a full-day Boston adventure, explore the New England Aquarium (no, not the Cabot Aquarium) located nearby!
Monday (bonus day to burst the bubble!):
The Institute of Contemporary Art
A bonus event for art lovers: “The Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston” is offering free admission for the whole day off (from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Special events running throughout the day include hands-on art making and showings of short films made by women and curated by the appropriately-named Grrl Haus Cinema. Tickets are usually $10 for students (unfortunately, it’s not one of those Boston museums where Harvard ID gets you in free), so take advantage of this freebie while you can!
We hate to burst your bubble, but Harvard isn’t the entire world. Go forth and burst the Harvard bubble with these Boston events!
