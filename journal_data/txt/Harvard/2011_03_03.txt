After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The travel bug is highly contagious to Harvard undergrads, as 60 percent of students have international experiences during college. While these four years are certainly an opportune time to expand our horizons, learn a new culture, and use our interests and skills working in other parts of the world, we forget sometimes that there are domestic opportunities that provide valuable experience, and teach us about overlooked populations and other cultures within the United   States.
There are great ways to contribute aid and volunteer time to important projects across the world that carry with them the promise of travel to exotic countries and nature. With air travel increasingly rapid and affordable in the 21st century, it also becomes easier and easier to jet across the world for a week. Sadly, we are faced with the externality of less attention being given to the scale of suffering that takes place across our own country on a daily basis. As the government faces up to the prospect of budget cuts over the next few years, it may very well be that social welfare and development aid comes under fiscal attack—a threat exemplified by the proposed cuts to Americorps. With this in mind, it is more important than ever that young people get involved on an active basis and that institutions like Harvard help us to do so.
This past J-term, a group of ten Harvard students travelled to New Mexico to deliver health care to people that are historically more ‘American’ than most of us, the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation is the largest tribe in America with over 250,000 people, and it spans the states of Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. In spite of the expansive territory they occupy, the Navajo have a very low standard of living. Over 56 percent live below the poverty level, and unemployment rates are ten times as high as other parts of America. The infrastructure within the reservation is largely underdeveloped, leaving many people isolated in their homes, with infrequent means of transportation.
The Harvard students went to the Navajo Nation with a pediatrician and an epidemiologist to screen children for developmental problems, and they also delivered firewood and canned food to people who lived in remote locations. The students spent a substantial amount of their time on the reservation traveling on terrible roads. The firewood and canned food they distributed was essential to some of the Navajo people who who had no other means of getting around. “Traveling through the reservation is reminiscent of traveling through a third world country,” Shalini Pammal ’13, observed in an interview. “Its very striking to see how impoverished a community like the native reservations can be within America because you typically aren’t made aware of it on a day to day basis.” She also noted that alcoholism seemed to be very prominent among the Navajo people, as some would leave the reservation to buy alcohol at surrounding gas stations at 8 a.m. in the morning. Quality education was also a struggle as the Head Start (federally funded preschools for low-income families) preschools were frequently closed due to impassible mud after rain. Many Navajo in the area where Pammal and the other students worked live in small, shoddy houses with no electricity, unsafe drinking water, and outhouses for toilets. In some cases, there were very large families living on unsustainable wages.
There seems to be some disconnect and strife between the Navajo and the authorities because the government will give them a checklist of standards and things to do, but they are not provided the tools necessary to do them.  The government has also been slow to respond to the health risks of the Navajo, including radiation from 520 open uranium mines. The radioactive material from these mines increases the risk of developing lung and bone cancers, as well as kidney problems. The government is starting an assessment - not a cleanup - of the damage done by the mines, but it isn’t expected to be completed until 2019.
While Pammal and her group were only in the Navajo Nation for a week, she admits it was “very disheartening to feel like you are only able to do so much, when they have so many issues that need to be addressed and brought to the attention of the rest of the country.”
This trip, organized through Philips Brooks House Association is one of many opportunities through different organizations on campus that allows students to explore domestic areas of need, and perhaps more students should look into opportunities like this that allow them to get to know relatively overlooked populations within America. While many of us have great ideas and intentions to ‘save the world,’ we forget that in addition to identifying problems outside our borders, sometimes we needn’t look farther than our own backyard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent call to the Harvard Disability Van Service went something like this:
“What time do the disability vans start operating on weekends?”
“12 noon.”
“So are there any other options before noon?”
“No, that’s the only service we offer.”
This conversation is typical of what disabled students have been hearing from the Disability Van Service, whose website states that it “is designed for persons who, because of physical impairment or medical condition, find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the regular fully accessible shuttle bus.” Disabled students can make appointments to have the vans pick them up when they need to get across campus—but appointments are available only at certain times.
The University’s shuttle service has been the subject of much controversy over the past two years, especially when--along with hot breakfast—it became one of the most reviled cuts in the administration’s $77 million budget slashes in 2009. However, one of the stories that has gone unnoticed in the controversy over shuttle schedules is the situation that disabled students face. Currently, many disabled students have no way of traveling between the Quad and the River on weekend mornings, and the University needs to do more to accommodate their transportation needs.
For most students, the cut in shuttle service on weekend mornings meant a 15-minute walk to Harvard Yard, as opposed to a five-minute shuttle ride. But for disabled students, this 15-minute walk is often difficult, if not impossible to make. Disabled students who need to get to campus for weekend meetings, religious services, or study sessions often can’t do so until the shuttles start running at noon. This obviously isn’t an equitable solution to the transportation dilemma posed by Quad life. Quadlings shouldn’t be excluded from participating in groups that meet by the River on weekend mornings, but that’s exactly what the absence of a disability shuttle at those times means for handicapped students living in the Quad.
The situation isn’t made better by the limited options for disability transport at night. After 7 p.m., the disability shuttle becomes the night shuttle, meaning that it is no longer easily accessible to handicapped students who need it for transportation. Students can call to arrange for the shuttle to pick them up after 7 p.m., but some have reported waiting for the van for over 45 minutes. It’s important for the College to ensure that disabled students have the same opportunities as others to study late in Lamont, accept nighttime jobs, meet with friends on the river, and participate in extracurricular activities, many of which meet late on weeknights. By making transport between the Quad and the River inconvenient or impossible at certain times, the College isn’t fulfilling its obligation to accommodate students with disabilities.
One of the most disconcerting elements of administrative and student responses to the disability van situation is the lack of attention it receives. While students protested the loss of hot breakfast and freezes in faculty pay—budget slashes that affected all students or professors across the board—the transportation options for disabled students were often ignored. If students are going to protest for different budget allocations, we should first be demanding that money be put into the disability van service so that handicapped students have the same opportunity as others to travel between the river and the Quad at all times. Hot breakfast can go, but the disability vans cannot if we intend to call ourselves an equal-opportunity university.

In 2009, the Reverend Peter J. Gomes—Harvard’s beloved chaplain for over three decades—was asked to describe how he envisioned his legacy. In response, Gomes said he wished to be remembered as a “thoughtful preacher,” one who “took the life of the mind very seriously,” and who “worked very hard at trying to find the right words to convey the right ideas.”
“I’d like people to think that that’s what I did and that I did it well and that I did it over a long period of time in a wide variety of places,” he said. “It would please me to be thought of as effective both in an exalted place like the Memorial Church at Harvard University and in a very modest pulpit like South Pond Chapel in the dark woods of Plymouth, Massachusetts—that I was able in those remarkably different settings to make people think and to cause them to react and to respond, that’s what I’m interested in, and I would hope that would be the legacy that I would leave behind.”
Unsurprisingly, even in his absence, his words come far closer to articulating the depth of emotion we feel in coming to terms with his passing much more powerfully than our own ever could.
Nevertheless, now is an opportune moment to explore and celebrate the legacy Gomes left for us all. At Harvard, he was an institution within an institution. His weekly teas at Sparks House, his rumbling and inspiring sermons, his popular Harvard history class, and even his wily antics on the Colbert Report make for fond personal memories that bring us all together in this time of loss, in the midst of immeasurable sadness. Although Harvard has lost a titan, Gomes’s legacy continues, both in our community and around the world, in the spirit of positivity, tolerance, inclusiveness, and humble kindness that he embodied through and through.
It is remarkable that even in his absence, Gomes’s words can still inspire us with the eternally glowing power of goodwill.  Above all else, Gomes extended his heart and his hand to every member of this community through an immediate pact of profound personal trust. In many ways, his words as well as his actions broke the silence for the underrepresented and those not able to speak for themselves. With striking courage, for instance, Gomes came out as a homosexual in 1991 in response to the gay-bashing plaguing the Harvard campus at the time, largely as a result of a short-lived student publication that decried the “bad alternative” to heterosexuality. In later years, his bestselling books, including “The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart,” advocated against the use of the Bible as fodder for discrimination against minorities.
Over the course of his life, his advocacy for increased tolerance on an impressively wide spectrum of social and spiritual issues gave a strong voice to the underrepresented and lent indelible courage to their cause. We are unmistakably fortunate that his enlightened words can live on both through our memories and through the impressive collection of written works he leaves behind, ranging from collections of sermons and newspaper editorials to interviews and meditations on the Bible and faith in the modern world.
Notably, Gomes was an outspoken advocate of spirituality in an age often hostile to any sort of religion. In 2007, he wrote a memorable piece for The Crimson in which he argued—in response to polemical atheists such as C. Richard Dawkins and Christopher E. Hitchens. “We may not be a godly place but we are anything but godless, and that is what makes the place so interesting,” he wrote then of the Harvard community. “It is no accident that our most significant ceremony, commencement, occurs in the space demarcated by the rational bulk of Widener Library and the spiritual aspirations of Memorial Church. If we are shaped by the space in which we live, we are better and richer for being shaped by the stimulating and complementary forces of faith and reason. No university or college worthy of the name need fear either.”
Gomes was a living archetype of pluralism and acceptance who will never be forgotten. In Harvard Thinks Big 2010, Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies, bolstered Gomes’s well-known opinion on the relevance of the study of religion when she said “‘Pluralism requires that we share a world, though not a worldview.’”  It is this sentiment that we must keep in mind when we remember Gomes and try to cope with the loss of this shining light in our community. The sheer number of decorations on his commencement gown attested to his ability to bring together a vast rainbow of different flags, causes, and beliefs under the umbrella of a single, peaceful identity. As a man who embodied a graceful coexistence of tradition and innovation, his presence has been, and will always be, integral to understanding and moving forward in the pluralism of our time.
In the same 2009 interview, Gomes said that “‘He made us think’ would be a very nice epitaph.” We could not agree more.

Mark Zuckerberg’s legacy looms large here at Harvard University. Student enrollment in Computer Science 50 spiked by 56 percent last fall, and the number of campus organizations dedicated to the cause of student entrepreneurship seems to be increasing by the day. A partial list of the clubs, collegiate societies and yearly events available to the tech entrepreneurs among us—to those coders and business executives here at Harvard who want to harness the disruptive power of digital technology to change the world, or those who just want to “build something cool” (as Mark Zuckerberg once said about Facebook)—includes: the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Society; the Kairos Society and Quincy House’s Q-Combinator; Hack Harvard and the Harvard College Innovation Challenge; Harvard College Venture Partners; The Harvard Innovation Lab; and TEDxHarvard.
Yet despite its rapid growth—or perhaps precisely because of it—the tech start-up community here at Harvard seems to be missing something important: namely, a mission. Tech entrepreneurship isn’t just about “building something cool”—it’s about building things that matter. The challenge of Zuckerberg’s legacy of entrepreneurship here on campus is not whether we can produce another Facebook (because surely we can); the challenge is whether our start-up community can translate its creative energies into the production of real solutions to the toughest problems our world really faces.
Last Wednesday evening, technology and the promise of public service converged at the CS50 Lounge in Maxwell Dworkin, where the Institute of Politics organized a meet-and-greet event with Code for America. Code for America is a new non-profit organization that helps web developers come together and build tech solutions to civic problems facing local government. Members of its Boston team, who have spent the last month interviewing more than 100 city agencies and officials around the city, presented their findings to the crowd and laid out their vision of public-private partnerships between local governments and start-up communities all across the country—a vision captured by the term “Gov 2.0.”
Gov 2.0 is based on the idea that government can be a “platform” more than a “service provider”: Instead of simply providing services to citizens in exchange for their tax dollars, the government becomes an enabler of direct action by citizens on behalf of their fellow Americans (“citizen-to-citizen”). In this model, the government sponsors competitions or sets up fellowships, encouraging private sector entrepreneurs to utilize public resources—like open data—in order to solve public problems. The government doesn’t build the crime report app or the commuter rail timetable—you do. And the result is a government that spends less money, fosters more great ideas, and one which incorporates the voice of the citizenry more directly in the process of democratic self-governance.
We at the Institute of Politics are proud to announce the first major Gov 2.0 initiative here on campus. The IOP Gov 2.0 Summer Grant, which is soliciting one-page project proposals by Friday, March 4, will provide $5,000 of support funding for the individual or group that submits the most innovative idea to reshape American civic life through technology. Inspired by Hack Harvard’s incubator, the program will also connect finalists with experts from an array of fields who will help them to develop their project ideas. It is our hope that this effort is the beginning of a lasting Gov 2.0 community on campus.
Gov 2.0 presents us with an alternative model of active citizenship—“citizens as entrepreneurs,” “public service” as the imagining of new, creative solutions to old, intractable problems. Active citizenship is not just about rallying and it’s not just about voting—it’s also about building things. And here techies are uniquely suited to be the best types of citizens. Gov 2.0 is thus more than just an alternative mission statement for the Harvard start-up community. At its best, it challenges a whole new generation of techies—those in the Harvard start-up community and beyond—to engage their work in the task in rebuilding our democracy.

From 1993 to 2011, Bartholomew “Bart” T. Stupak served as the U.S. Representative from Michigan’s 1st congressional district. The pro-life Democrat came under national scrutiny in 2009 for opposing federal funding for abortions with the Stupak-Pitts Amendment to President Obama’s Health Care bill. Now retired from the political arena, the Institute of Politics Spring Fellow spoke to FM about his life experiences, his hair, and his future.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You have been a state trooper, a practitioner of law, member of the State Legislature and a Congressman. Where does IOP Fellow rank among these positions?
Bart T. Stupak: Right up on top. I look at it as like the capstone of my political career. They recognized that I had something to contribute to the world of politics, and I was asked to share it with young students. I was really honored.
2. FM: What was your experience as a state trooper like? (My mother is a police officer but I’m pretty sure she’ll run for the hills at the sight of a fight.)
BTS: Actually, most of my time was spent doing investigations. I was the only attorney in the Michigan State Police so I did special assignments. I led a team of six troopers and we were the mobile strike force, so if there’s a demonstration, we’d be the first team to go. We did murder investigations, the Ku Klux Klan. We did all kinds of things, and at the end I was investigating members of the Michigan State Legislature. Four years later, I was a member of the legislature. So being a police officer for me was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, I was injured and retired from the state police in 1984.
3. FM: What was the transition like from the Police Department of Michigan to Congress? Which one is scarier: Michigan’s crime scene or Capitol Hill’s battlefield?
BTS: Michigan’s crime scene. In between I practiced law for a couple of years, then went into politics. But no doubt, some of the cases I worked on were much more intimidating than members of Congress.
4. FM: What’s the best and worst thing about Michigan?
BTS: The best is the lake and the outdoors. The worst? Right now, it’s the economy. The auto industry hasn’t recovered, and we’re still struggling.
5. FM: After having seen and interacted with Harvard students, do you wish that you had come here instead?
BTS: No. Harvard for me, at that time in my life, would probably be a little intimidating. So I was happy where I went, a small community college in Michigan. There, I got to play sports and really enjoyed college life. After that, I started working, so Harvard wouldn’t have been for me.
6. FM: Have you had a chance to sit in on any undergraduate classes?
BTS: Yes I have, a couple in communications and speech writing. I’ve been to public speaking clinics, the JFK Forum, and the other fellows’ workshops. I believe that whenever you have the opportunity, you should try to learn. If I didn’t, when I was injured at the police department, I’d have been in a rough shape. When I went to the state police, I only had a two-year degree. While there, I earned my bachelor’s degree and got my law degree, never knowing what was going to happen. I ended up getting injured, but I was already an attorney so I had a good career to fall back on. The moral of the story is, whenever you can, you must grab an education. You’re never too old to learn.
7. FM: Do you miss being a college student?
BTS: I’m sort of a college student again, and I find it exciting. I’ve read three books since I’ve been here. I love to read, but in legislature you’re always reading memos, briefing papers or testimonials. So I’ve really enjoyed the opportunity to read books.
8. FM: Has anyone told you you kind of look like Anderson Cooper? Do you have any secret to great hair?
BTS: No, they usually tell me I look like Sam Waterson [from “Law and Order”]. Great hair? It grays really easily. When I went to Congress, I had a white spot only, and the guys called me Spot. I’m tall, so when we had events on the House floor, people would ask, “Where should we look for you?” and they would say “Always look for the guy with the white spot, and I’ll be two rows behind him.” So I was like the beacon. Anyway, I’ve got a full head of hair with a white spot. I told my wife I got that the day I walked down the aisle. Joking, of course. She doesn’t think it’s funny.
9. FM: Having been through three administrations, do you have a favorite President? (Don’t worry, we’re bipartisan.)
BTS: Bill Clinton by far is my favorite President. I went in with him in 1992, and you always have a special bond with the president you went in with. We did a lot of things together, like golf or other social occasions. When I see him now, it’s always a friendly reunion. I like Bill Clinton.
10. FM: Could you describe each of the three presidents in one word?
BTS:  Clinton: Brilliant. Bush: Quick-witted. Obama: Too serious.
11. FM: In 1992, you won in a traditionally Republican district, and you’re a pro-life Democrat. What’s it like, always being the minority?
BTS: That was a reason why I was never home, because you always had to attend these events because you had to build relationships within the district so people’d vote for you. So being a minority required you to put in extra effort. So there’s the sacrifice there.
12. FM: What is the best and worst thing about being a politician?
BTS: The worst thing for me was the constant travel and never being home. The best thing is the opportunity to serve our country.
13. FM: What advice would you give to students who aspire to pursue a career in politics post graduation?
BTS: Do it. It’s a noble profession. Don’t let anyone tell you differently.
14. FM: Can you finish the sentence? If Sarah Palin becomes President of the United States in 2012 ...
BTS: I will leave the country.
15. FM: What do you hope to be remembered as?
BTS: Honest.

This spring break, the hottest Harvard party will be relocated from Mt. Auburn St. to Punta Cana, a popular (and rowdy) beach destination in the Dominican Republic.
The Barcelo Punta Cana hotel, advertised on its website as an “elegant Mediterranean-inspired all inclusive beachfront resort boasting a long stretch of dazzling powder-soft beach,” will soon play host to 118 Harvard students, according to the unofficial Punta Cana Spring Break 2011 Facebook group administered by Charles A. LaCalle ’11 and Kathleen Ma ’12. This crowd includes final club bros, sorority sisters, and various other members of the party-hopping species.
“Some social leaders on campus decided to go there this year, and then everyone followed suit,” said Jeffrey J. Lee ’11, one member of the bandwagon, in an attempt to explain the mass exodus from Cambridge to the Caribbean.
“We wanted to go somewhere tropical and warm, somewhere spring ‘breaky,’” said Bret A. Voith ’11, whose “unit” of four guys decided on their destination in January. “Punta Cana is surprisingly easy to get to and cheap, as far as the Caribbean goes,” he added.
“[The Dominican Republic] is catering especially to students in terms of prices,” said Sociology Professor Orlando Patterson, a native of Jamaica whose area of expertise includes Caribbean studies. “It’s the best time of the year to visit the Caribbean.”
And it’s possible that for spring break, Punta Cana will turn into a collegiate town. Aside from Harvard, other colleges such as Arizona State University and George Washington University are also headed in that direction, according to Punta Cana bound Evan J. Zepfel ’13, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
The predicted pack of Punta Cana partiers is exciting for Lee, who spent last year’s spring break in Antarctica by himself. “The Harvard Hoochies are so ubiquitous on campus that I feel like I party at a state school every time I go out,” he said. “But maybe these state schools’ girls will actually live up to the stereotypes.”
For Voith, the purpose of this trip is clear. “General goals are to not get food poisoning, get a tan, and enjoy the last trip where ‘I’m in college’ is a legitimate explanation for how everyone behaves,” he said.

The new Au Bon Pain is a lot like one of my grandmother’s Mrs. Doubtfire-style hugs—it’s hard to leave. Just like the forceful embrace of my grandmother—or a veral 40-year-old Robin Williams—ABP’s new facade doesn’t allow a quick escape. Instead, you have to march past the pastries and the coffee station and the salad bar and the register and the dining area before coming up for air. But I love it, and it loves me back.
People tell me I’m an independent person, and ABP approves. The new design allows me to create my own meals at the soup and salad bar and prepare my own Vanilla Roast at the expanded coffee station. I do what I want. Independence isn’t a burden, it’s a feature of the ABP experience.
In terms of ambience, the dining area has become remarkably more intimate. Opportunities to rub elbows with strangers abound. Just one left-handed person seated next to you is all it takes to turn brunch into a brawl. Who wouldn’t want the opportunity to adjust the nose of that enthusiastic kid in section, or to throw on your best Kiwi accent and swing like Russell Crowe?
The new design also does a pretty good job of turning away anyone who was part of the grab-and-go crowd. Nobody likes someone who eats and runs; those people can take their frosting-covered faces to Dunkin’ Donuts.
But in the end, it’s comforting to know that my fellow patrons and I are the illy to other establishments’ McCafe. It’s reassuring that the scruffy gentleman to my left and I share the same dedication to our sandwiches, and that he takes this meal as seriously as I do.

I remember the halcyon days of my freshman year: I would walk through the glass doors into the dim entryway of Au Bon Pain, clutching my bag in front of me as I put in my order. Then, when it was filled, I would bolt back out to the world of red-brick formality, my heart still racing from those few furious moments of proletarian life.
But those days are over! The only place in Harvard Square that had not been remodeled to match its bourgeois neighbors is officially no more—and I hate it.
ABP is now yet another café where students and professors whip out their laptops and novels while drinking black espresso and eat a turkey sandwich with light mayo, American cheese and no bread. Instead of talking to themselves, everyone is now whispering sweet nothings to their iPhones. There are no more sparrows tapping on the glass as they try to escape. And the bathroom—wait for it—is clean.
Au Bon Pain used to be the ironic twist in a town where every other café has its own special name for a Café au Lait. With the fanciest name—because it’s French—and the grungiest clientele, ABP was a pithy contradiction. But it too has fallen into the trap of the middle-upper class university town.

This weekend, the College will be invaded by the nosy, embarrassing, and oh-so-lovable parents of the Class of 2012. Yes, it’s the long-awaited Junior Parents Weekend, when juniors are sure to get some free meals and plenty of free advice—while everyone else gets a headache from the old people speaking up in lecture and crowding the dining halls. In preparation for the impending arrival of your parentals, here are a few surefire conversation topics to turn to in times of need:
1. “No Mom, I swear that condom/bong/hooker is my roommate’s.”
2. “History of Art and Architecture concentrators get an incredible amount of job offers right out of college, Dad. For example, [prior research required for this topic].”
3. “So when I said girlfriend, I kinda meant boyfriend ....”
4. “When you flip the cup, the idea is to make it land upside down. Yes, I know this means some will spill. No, you can’t do it the other way. Yes, everyone is waiting on you. No, I don’t have a summer job lined up yet.”
5. “Why aren’t you rich or famous or both like everyone else’s parents?!”
6. “That book may look like it’s never been opened, but it’s actually just because I take such good care of my things. Knowledge is precious.”
7. “The dining hall’s going to be pretty crowded, we should probably just go out to eat. Well, we could go to [insert any restaurant that does not serve burritos, pizza, and/or hamburgers].”
8. “3.0 is the new 4.0.”
9. “Alright, let’s try this one more time. Facebook is a so-called social networking site where I can keep track of my friends. Yes, I do know that I can talk to them on the phone. Yes, I also know that identity theft is not a joke. Look Dad, a museum!”
10. “Ah yes, of course I remember the parents of my freshman-year roommate that I haven’t talked to in two years. Sure, I would love to go talk to them.”
BONUS (Not for Parents): Is your friend’s mom a tiger mom or cougar mom? Clearly no argument about which kind is better in this case.

Harvard claims that housing assignments are completely random, but FM has searched long and hard for the real story. Never mind the bollocks; here’s the Veritas!
* Blocking with an athlete guarantees you a river House, because Harvard needs its recruits to be near to the athletic fields. This rule does not apply to the crew team, because crew is not just a sport: it’s a way of life.
* If you have a serious allergy, you will be placed by the river because it is closer to UHS. “Green Is the New Crimson” also applies to saving ambulance gas.
* Children of celebrities will get put in Currier House, because it has the best security. (Fun fact: Harvard closed all but one of the ways into Currier when Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 was housed there.)
*Members of the squash team get to choose what House they’re in.
*If you enter your blocking form at precisely 3:17 a.m., you will enter a special group that gets first-rate housing in the secret House under the Yard.
*The Oak Club actually dictates the housing lottery, ensuring all its future members are together by the river and banishing un-cool blocking groups to the Quad—a safe distance from the members’ mighty awesomeness.

Aticus A. Peterson ’14 is an active member of the Mormon community at Harvard, and he will be spending the next two years not at school but instead in Taiwan, doing missionary work. Two of his blockmates will also be going on missions next year, making blocking a more complicated experience for them than it is for most students.
As Peterson stirs his hot chocolate with whipped cream, he talks about the time he spends tutoring underprivileged children, teaching English to Chinese students, and giving piano lessons. He goes about his weeks and weekends without consuming alcohol or caffeine—thus the hot chocolate. Two of his blockmates are other Mormons whom he met through church: “Great guys,” he explains, “who understand where I’m coming from.”
Yet Peterson also made a concerted effort to meet students outside of the Mormon community at Harvard. Three of his new blockmates are non-Mormon, the roommates and entryway-mates of a Mormon friend. “It’s so easy for me to gravitate towards other Mormons just because we’re all having similar experiences. So I made an effort to come out of that group when I came.” He does acknowledge the existence of Mormon clusters in every Harvard class—“Although which class am I really in?” he wonders aloud. The ambiguity of his position at Harvard when he returns in two years, when he will technically be a sophomore, makes blocking with other Mormons, who will also return to campus after a two-year mission, that much more attractive.
Peterson, however, says that Mormons are no more divided from the rest of the Harvard community than many other cultural, even other religious, groups. Speaking about homogeneity, Peterson says, “I feel that it exists at Harvard. People tend to group together based off of interest or whatever else makes them click. A lot of times it’s those student groups that bring people together, and a lot are based off of race or religion.” For instance, he notes that many Jewish students on campus seem to spend time together.
Peterson’s conflict between diversity and familiarity isn’t uncommon among freshmen. Nkechinyerem U. Iko ’14, one of his classmates, puts it plainly: “Opposites don’t always attract.” After all, she says, “If you like yourself, you’re obviously going to have friends who are very similar to you, that have the characteristics about yourself that you enjoy.” The statement begs the question: when searching for our future blockmates, are we looking in the mirror?
THE SYSTEM
This is Suzanne M. Watts’ sixth year as the Pforzheimer House Administrator, but before that she had the same job at Quincy, and she has also worked as what used to be called the “housing officer” in what used to be the “housing office” (now the Office of Student Life, which oversees the freshmen lottery process). By now an expert on blocking groups, Watts speaks about general trends over the lull of soft classical music in her bright, cozy office in the Quad. She says she isn’t aware of too many commonalities within blocking groups, other than athletes—“But that’s sort of a given,” she says. They have the same hours, and they’re very team-oriented, she explains.
Otherwise, there is the freshmen roommate/entryway tendency to stick together in some cases. But because Harvard makes a concerted effort to mix up the freshmen suites, especially in terms of geographic background, blocking groups exhibit diversity, Watts thinks.
And once the groups move into the Houses, more stick together than don’t in terms of rooming groups for junior and senior year. If they are going to break up, they usually do so sophomore year, “when they come into their own a little more and realize it’s not a perfect match.” But some groups are loyal. Watts is a fan of the linking system—which has only been around for 10 years or so—because having more friends at least in the neighborhood ties students to their Houses. According to Watts, inter-house transfer requests have lowered since the introduction of the option of linking. Even before that, students used to be able to block with up to 16 people. “It became a little disruptive because you found that you got the whole football team in one House,” she says. The goal of each House is to be a microcosm of the college in terms of student diversity, and having smaller blocking groups has helped reached this goal.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67  has been a member of the Harvard community for decades and has overseen numerous efforts to make blocking a more positive experience for students. Countless focus groups and surveys later, Dingman and other members of the administration have come to the same conclusion: “While the process is stressful for many, there really is no better system.”
Dingman, with an affable, friendly demeanor, speaks earnestly about blocking in a way that contradicts the stereotype of the rigid, inaccessible Harvard administrator. He emphasizes again and again how much he hates to see students get hurt during the blocking process. A pained expression becomes evident when he recounts the e-mail he sent to the freshmen class advising them to be open and honest in their conversations with their peers, after becoming aware of several instances of freshmen unexpectedly finding themselves the “odd man out” in a blocking group.
Dingman corroborates Watts’ theory about blocking group formations. The entryways, he believes, are “reflective of the overall diversity of the school.” Some people, he concedes, will not end up forming a close relationship with their roommates or entryway-mates and have to look outside of that community for blockmates. In those cases, more groups will form based off of extracurriculars or sports teams. Still, he cautions against labeling a group as “homogenous” just because all its members share a common interest. It does not seem fair to him to label a group of all-male lacrosse-players “the same,” simply because they practice a sport together every afternoon.
BUILDING A HOME AWAY FROM HOME
Cagla G. Seten ’13, who goes by her middle name, Gamze, lives in Leverett House but hails from Turkey. She grins as she announces that her blocking group is locally famous for its makeup of eight different nationalities, none of them American. Among the represented countries are France, Germany, Cambodia, Peru, Italy, Ireland, Israel, and of course Turkey.
The eight international students met before freshman week, during the Freshman International Program (FIP). Gamze acknowledges her attachment to these very first people she met at Harvard, the ones with whom she learned how to draw money from American banks, and other such cultural concerns. After FIP was over, they would often frequent events held by Woodbridge, a society devoted to international students at Harvard. Although there was some drama with not having enough room for other friends in the group (“Like every blocking group,” she muses), it worked out and everyone has been happy with the decision. Gamze notes that hers is certainly not the first group of Woodbridge people to block together. This year there are at least two such groups, she says.
“It’s cute in a way,” Gamze comments about her all-international blocking group. “Internationals understand each other better.” They are all experiencing life in a foreign culture: “It’s more like a secure bubble for us.” On American holidays attached to three-day weekends, they try to do something together, like go skiing.
There are other advantages: “We have inside jokes about our countries that would be inappropriate outside our blocking group, like Turkey not being able to enter the EU,” she says. “They wouldn’t do that if it wasn’t just the intimacy of the eight of us. And that applies to all the countries we have, because obviously all countries have their own issues.”
Six of the blockmates are FIP leaders, and all are very involved with Woodbridge—also in the blocking group are the social chair and the organizer of FIP. But beyond that, they have different interests, especially academic—VES, psychology, government, economics, social studies and philosophy, to name a few. Gamze pauses and jokes: “We probably don’t have anything in common to live with each other.” But she likes it. “We never get bored because we always have something to talk about.”
Not all of her blockmates spend all their time together; they’ve found a balance that works for them. Gamze has a lot of American friends, as do her other blockmates. “We love them,” she says. Gamze feels guilty at times that there’s no “American culture” in her blocking group, since they are in the U.S. after all. But their blockmate from France has been living in the states for the past 10 years, “so it kind of makes up for it,” she notes.
THE RACE FACTOR
Most Harvard students will say that they did not consider race to be a factor in creating their blocking group, but some end up being more racially homogenous than others.
Ijeoma B. Eboh ’11, with her blocking days long behind her, is the president of the Association of Black Harvard Women (ABHW). She found her best friends and blockmates through her involvement in the black community on campus, she says. Ijeoma confirms the trend that Watts and Dingman have noticed, of students either blocking with their freshman year roommates or looking outside of their rooms and finding blockmates through their extracurricular activities. These groups are naturally more homogenous, she says, because they are generally based around a shared activity or identification with a certain culture.
“People are attracted to people who are like them. It’s how people naturally develop friendships. You’re probably not going to meet some random person unless you’re doing an activity with them,” explains Ijeoma. From Ijeoma’s perspective, unless you are the type of person who puts your tray down with a group of strangers at Annenberg every day, you will find the people you connect with most at Harvard through on-campus extracurricular groups.
Ijeoma held a blocking group meeting for members of ABHW during which students ranging from sophomores to seniors reflected on their blocking experiences. Part of the discussion centered around racially homogenous blocking groups.
Nkechinyerem, also a member of ABHW and a freshman in the midst of blocking, attended the meeting and found it helpful to hear about other black students’ experiences. Nkechinyerem is not blocking with other black students at Harvard, and says that she never felt any pressure to do so, although she adds, there is a blocking group of all black girls in the freshman class. “Just because an entire blocking group is black doesn’t mean it was a conscious decision,” says Nkechinyerem, “They all just could have been good friends, or maybe they met at an ABHW meeting.”
Ijeoma sees some problems with blocking groups composed entirely of members of the same race and sometimes wishes her own blocking group was more diverse. “I always advise ABHW girls that if they are in an ‘all black’ blocking group that they do other activities and are not only immersed in the black community,” says Ijeoma. “Sometimes you can get sucked into your blocking group and it ends up being hard to make friends outside of it.” When a student came to her who was deciding between blocking with her roommates and blocking with other ABHW girls, she advised her to block with her roommates because ABHW events would always keep her in contact with the other group.
And is a blocking group composed entirely of ABHW girls any different than one composed of rowers or English majors? Amber A. James ’11, another member of ABHW who is in an all-black blocking group, believes that a so-called “black group” can contain groups of people with more diverse personalities and interests than one that seems diverse racially but actually consists of all the same “type” of person.
“My group may be all black, but we’re all so different and we’ve had such different experiences growing up. We’re such different people. We’re also socioeconomically very different. Some of us are on financial aid, some of us aren’t,” Amber explains. Race, she continues is only one factor to look at in a blocking group. It may seem to be the most salient factor if you take a snapshot of a group, but once you look past the faces, groups that look similar might not be similar at all.
And perhaps Harvard is so full of different types of people that forming groups composed entirely of one kind of person can be challenging, if not impossible. “I haven’t really noticed a racial trend here,” says Amber. “Because Harvard is such a diverse place we don’t have that many people that are cut from the same cloth.”
Benjamin J. Marek ’14, for example, is in a racially diverse blocking that includes students from Texas, New York, Florida, Minnesota, California, and England. “Maybe there are some groups where kids are really similar, have the same backgrounds, but what binds my group together is that we all just get along really well.” His group consists of students from entirely different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Racially homogenous blocking groups, he believes, are “the exception, not the norm.” Indeed, about 10 years ago, Dean Dingman recalls that the Office of Student Life collected data on a number of measurements of diversity such as race and academic interests, and at the time did not find “anything to be alarmed about.”
CONCENTRATION OVERLAP
At an institution so thoroughly concerned with academics, it shouldn’t be surprising to find that a common thread within blocking groups is excellence in a specific academic area.
Kevin Lee ’12, in his Kirkland sweatshirt, leans back all the way in his chair and recalls his days in Math 55, the notoriously fast-paced honors abstract algebra course taken mostly by freshmen, where he met three of his blockmates. Greg, Winston, and Alex were two of Kevin’s fellow warriors in the Grays Basement “war room,” as it was known among the Math 55ers, where the nine students in the class would meet eachnight first semester. Kevin remembers spending 40 hours in the “war room” per week, sustaining his classmates with his and Winston’s snack runs to CVS. (Second semester, the class “cared less” and would pull a collective all-nighter before the problem set was due each week instead of working on it in advance, Kevin recalls.)
The other blockmates met each other in Physics 16, the most challenging of the introductory physics classes for potential concentrators. Sway, Ruby, Joy, Herman, and Alex (who also took Math 55) spent 10 to 15 hours per week on problem sets together. Kevin points to Winston H. Luo ’12 as the main link between the groups. Kevin remembers that Winston was proactive about forming a group of his close friends, so everyone in the group is pretty close with him. Winston says he knew Ruby through Chinese class, and she lived in Matthews Hall with Herman and Joy. After they decided to block, the group, which is currently made up of students of Asian origin, stayed on campus between terms their freshman year and started bonding. Winston remembers playing a lot of cards that week.
In reality, the ties go back further than that. Sway, Kevin, Winston, and Alex met during the summer of 2005 at the Math Olympiad Program (MOP) in Nebraska. MOP is a training camp that funnels students into the selection pool for the US math team, which is a team of six high school students that represents the US in the International Math Olympiad. Out of the four, Alex made the team.
Harvard’s Advanced Standing program, which gives students the opportunity to graduate in four years with a master’s degree under undergraduate housing and financial aid, also links the group together. According to Winston, who is getting his master’s in applied math, Ruby is getting hers in engineering, and Kevin and Joy are getting theirs in computer science. Kevin says this extra academic load has linked four or five of his blockmates throughout—technically three or four now, because Greg transferred to MIT and then dropped out of college altogether (“When he spontaneously decided it wasn’t just Harvard that wasn’t for him, it was school,” Kevin says with a laugh). Greg is now working for a start-up (the details of which are confidential) in Silicon Valley. In Greg’s absence, they’ve adopted another Kirkland resident to join their suite of eight, and Kevin said Greg’s leaving probably has caused him to spend less time with his blocking group as a whole, since Greg had been part of his main social circle. “I think this is true for the others; it’s certainly true for me: our primary social group is not our blocking group. But we are still good friends.”
Sway P. Chen ’12 feels the same way as her blockmate Kevin. She admits that it is a little unusual at Harvard to be surrounded by all CS and physics people, but she has friends outside the room from all different concentrations, so it balances out. One such group is their linking group in Eliot, which is “all over the map” in terms of concentrations.
Sway is a chemistry and physics concentrator, and Kevin and Winston are CS. Their other blockmates also study math, physics, or chemistry and physics, math being the common ground. “We have this habit of calling each other out on statements that are false in a strict sense,” he says, though he explains that they do this more as an inside joke than anything else. “There’s this sense that we are all on the same page when we talk and it’s this very precise, like mathematical or logical kind of way.”
PUZZLE PIECES
Thus the common language of the Math 55ers is of course this hyper-logical attitude towards reasoning. The blockmates had a white-board in their suite last year where people would draw Rebus puzzles, as in writing “back” in the far bottom corner, signifying the expression “backed into a corner.” “Those puzzley, mathy things we can all do pretty well,” says Winston.
In order to figure out who among them would live in doubles their sophomore year, furthermore, the boys came up with a double blind preference voting system. After a four-stage process, the two people who rated each other the highest ended up in the double, but no one had to know whom anyone else had rated. Kevin speaks quickly and easily: “At some point it was more just a, ‘we think that such a system must exist, let’s try to find it,’ rather than an actual, practical thing.” Obviously they don’t know for sure if it worked, because no one knows whom anyone else rated, but they’re fairly certain. They came up with a proof that showed that it worked, so it probably did.
Fitting people together for three years can be similarly enigmatic. For some, common experience can help to keep things together.
“I just feel that blocking becomes so stressful because it seems so permanent,” says Nkechinyerem, “At the end of the day you don’t have any control over what happens besides those eight people that you choose to live with.”  In a situation with such little control, it can be attractive to turn to constants.
But for some, of course, it’s simple. “The moral of the story,” says Marek, “is that you room with who you like and who you get along with and who you want to live with. Everything else, dorm, race, city or origin, socioeconomic status” he concludes, “is just a piece of the puzzle.”

Nazism, in the United States, is not commonly associated with the word “patriotism” other than in the context of loyalty to a debased credo. It may be surprising to learn, therefore, that during WWII the U.S. Army had an active duty unit comprised of pro-Nazi sympathizers, stationed at Camp Hale, Colo. According to Thomas E. Ricks, Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, the theory behind forming this pro-Nazi group was that putting them all together was “much better than kicking them out into society and losing track of them.” It was also far more lenient than punishing them.
One such member of this unlikely unit was Harvard alumnus Dale H. Maple ’41, Phi Beta Kappa and Magna Cum Laude. Accepted to Harvard with a full scholarship in 1937, Maple was a good-looking, intelligent, tall, blonde teenager from San Diego High School in San Diego, Calif. where he graduated first out of 585 students. While at Harvard, he concentrated in Declarative Phylogeny and joined a number of student organizations including PBHA, Glee Club, the German club, ROTC, and the Boylston Chemical Club, for which he served as treasurer. However, after voicing pro-Nazi beliefs and acting hostile to all forms of democratic government, Maple was promptly kicked out of many of these organizations. He also displayed a martial streak that compelled him to join ROTC and later enlist in the U.S. Army as a private. On Nov. 15, 1940 he was quoted in The Crimson as saying “even a bad dictatorship is better than a good democracy.”
On campus, Maple was a model of academic achievement, breezing through his classes. There were, however, a slew of signs suggesting that he was no model American. The German club discharged him for insisting on singing Nazi songs. Following his expulsion from the club, he was also kicked out of ROTC for “not being fit material for an officer.” The Colorado Heritage Newspaper reported that he attended only one party while at Harvard, a costume gathering where he showed up as Adolf Hitler.
While Maple spoke 23 languages, he always had a particular fascination with everything German. During his senior year Maple focused his studies on the German language, culture, and literature. He also bragged to all who would listen about fabricated trips to Germany. Then, only a few months after graduation, on Dec. 7, 1941, Maple telephoned the German Embassy in Washington to alert them that if the U.S. and Germany went to war and the German diplomatic staff in the U.S. returned to the Reich, he wanted to join their entourage.  He did not receive an encouraging reply.
Despite all this, in 1942, Maple enlisted in the U.S. Army, where, according to Ricks, he was placed in the 620th Engineer General Service Company, which despite its impressive title was actually a holding unit for about 200 GIs of suspect loyalty. Although Maple was himself an American citizen by birth, many of the others serving in the 620th were German-born. Members of the 620th unit were kept unarmed and given mostly busy work such as making tents, digging ditches, and sawing wood, according to the Colorado Heritage. Camp Hale also happened to be home to a detachment of about 200 German prisoners of war on a work program.
Although fraternization between soldiers and prisoners was forbidden at Camp Hale, the men of the 620th quickly discovered a common bond with the German prisoners. Maple was no exception to this illicit bonding and once, while allegedly on a three-day leave, snuck into the POW compound where he found he fit in nicely, even wearing a borrowed uniform.
Many men of the 620th, despite enlisting voluntarily, were constantly looking for ways to undermine the American war effort, through espionage and guerrilla warfare. The administration at Camp Hale during this period was remarkably inept, which allowed the prisoners to amass a number of contraband items, including extra Army uniforms. By the winter of 1944 the friendship between the soldiers and prisoners had metastasized to a point where they conspired overtly to sabotage the war effort and help some of the Germans escape. Ever-ambitious, Maple took charge of the plan.
According to Time Magazine it was decided that Maple would report for sick leave, then he and two prisoners would sneak away by bus on Feb. 12, 1944 to Salida, Colo., a city 60 miles to the south. In Salida they purchased a .22 caliber revolver and a 1934 sedan. After driving south for a few days their sedan broke down near the Mexican border. They had hoped that in Mexico they would be able to find help getting to Germany via some sort of “underground railroad.” At 4:30 p.m., on Feb. 18, 1944, Mexican customs inspector Medardo Martinez came across the odd-looking trio in US military uniforms trying to cross the border and arrested them.
Maple was charged with aiding the enemy and desertion—both capital offences. After a three-week court case, he was found guilty on all counts.  At age 24, Maple was sentenced to death, but this punishment was later reviewed by President Roosevelt and changed to life imprisonment. Maple was a model prisoner; teaching, leading a church choir, and writing for the prison magazine, and his sentence was shortened.
Roosevelt was acting on the recommendation of the Army’s judge advocate general, who wrote, “On the face of the record there appears to be little or nothing to suggest mitigation. But the accused is only 24 years of age, and is inexperienced ... I feel that the ends of justice will better be served by sparing his life so that he may live to see the destruction of tyranny, the triumph of the ideals against which he sought to align himself, and the final victory of the freedom he so grossly abused.” After his release in 1951, he disappeared from the public record and led a quiet life until he died of natural causes 50 years later.

For the past two years, Professor Elisa New would turn off the lights and close the door to Barker 148 around five o’clock on Wednesdays, then take the T to Logan Airport to board a six o’clock flight, getting back to her Washington D.C. apartment in time for dinner at eight.
The daily journeys of Harvard professors to and from campus differ as widely as the subjects they teach, but even within the same department, mileage varies. In contrast to New’s 450-mile weekly commute, English Department colleague Professor Leland de la Durantaye enjoys a 10-minute bike ride to campus from his home in nearby Huron Village.
So why for two years would New subject herself to such travel—twice-weekly, thrice-monthly flights—up and down the East Coast? According to her, she did it for family and for country. At the time, her husband, former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers ’82, was serving in the White House as the Director of the National Economic Council.
“I wanted him to be able to serve our country, but we also wanted to see each other,” said New.
She acknowledges the consideration of the English Department, which permitted her to condense her teaching schedule into a three-day block from Monday through Wednesday, allowing her to live in Washington from Wednesday nights through Sunday evenings to see her husband and 14-year-old daughter while balancing full-time teaching duties.
“It turned out to be highly productive. Having an artificial division between different kinds of work—I’d leave teaching on Wednesday so Thursday and Friday would be writing days—as well as fewer commitments at the Washington apartment created a fertile writing environment,” said New.
And yet, the best part of the entire experience was not that she became more productive but that she enjoyed living a more stable domestic life.
“Larry has always traveled a lot, and this was a feature of our life already. However, when you work at the White House, you really stay there all the time. We were living a calmer, more domestic life, and that meant more dinners together at home and more quality time with my family,” said New.

I write to you, dear reader, not with an update quickly scribbled within the storied stacks of Lamont or Widener, but in absentia: I am far from Harvard’s hallowed halls, tucked instead in the comfortable confines of my home in New Orleans. This weekend, as New Orleanians the world over will happily remind you, marks the highest of holidays on the social calendar of a city known for its ability to rage: that massive city-wide party of “Girls Gone Wild” fame—Mardi Gras—is once again upon us.
Although the annual bacchanalia of beer, beads, and boobs constitutes a seemingly sacred and unchanging ritual ’round these parts, many of the area’s staunchest traditionalists are apt to comment how markedly today’s celebration of Mardi Gras has departed from the historical origins of the solemnity. New Orleans’ Mardi Gras has its roots in the older European festival of ‘carnival,’ in which widespread public feasting was meant to prepare pious Catholics for a subsequent fasting in observance of Lent. Incorporating elements from earlier pagan ceremonies (the Roman Saturnalia comes to mind), carnival was not only a time of raucous indulgence: its carefree and satirical character created a designated space for the inversion and subversion of social roles, performing a sort of societal bloodletting, if you will, that restored a careful equilibrium to the medieval cosmos.
This year, as I celebrate Mardi Gras from home, the festival’s celebration of upheaval and ordered chaos seems particularly apropos, as the unexpected necessity of taking a break from my studies in my penultimate semester as an undergraduate has certainly thrust upon me its own brand of confusion and chaos. How exactly have I responded to this confusion, you ask? While I continue to work on my thesis project at a leisurely pace that many a thesis-writing senior would venomously envy, I’ve also benefitted from a different sort of eduction as I scrappily scramble to earn my keep here at home.
Things I’ve learned include the acknowledgement that working in your aunt’s chocolate shop is probably not the best way to avoid looking like Augustus Gloop by the time Commencement rolls around. Here’s another: given the unpredictability of contemporary life, one finds that talents and abilities are often put to vastly different uses than might have originally been intended or expected. I, for example, have put my own wordsmithing skills to use writing cheeky product descriptions for the line of children’s watch accessories that my neighbor markets wholesale. After three and a half years of training in the liberal arts, behold, dear reader, the scriptural fruits of a Harvard education:
“Rrrroar ... let your inner animal run wild with Popocho’s Be Wild line! Available in striped or leopard fur and in blue or fuchsia scales, these skins are guaranteed to make you king of the beasts!”
As you might easily discern, my ample wit finds an appropriately sophisticated exercise in the creation of such gilded verse; in any case, at a rate of $15 for every 250 characters, it’s an easy way to make a truly quick buck, which, as I’ve learned in my five weeks at home, is as close as it comes to a poor college student’s ‘bottom line.’
A more unexpected lesson drawn from my experiences crafting shamelessly campy commercial prose might be my discovery that confusion and chaos serve a very definite purpose in life: renewal. They say that you can never really know what you’ve lost until it’s gone; I would like to think that I haven’t, in fact, really lost anything, but have simply been given an opportunity to find again those elements of my life at Harvard that make me most properly myself.
Perhaps that lost-and-found-again quality is expressed in the simple pleasure that I find in exercising skills and talents that I previously took for granted. Tying bows on boxes of Valentine’s Day chocolate may not be what I imagined myself doing my senior spring, but it has had its advantages: recall the famous episode of “I Love Lucy” in which the iconic redhead can’t seem to get the candies in her mouth fast enough, and you’ll have some idea of how I’ve spent many an afternoon this past February.
Too often as an undergraduate, I’ve found myself forgetting that what motivated me to get to Harvard—nevermind what (or better yet, who) is motivating me to finish—was a genuine sense of enjoyment derived from the hard and at times mundane work of being a student. As I release myself of the illusion that life will always go exactly as planned and continue to bounce happily from odd-job to odd-job, I have begun to recognize the oft-overlooked value of finding enjoyment in anything and everything you do, whether that be wrapping candy or writing response papers. My time at home has proven to be an education in confusion, a valuable time to learn that most experiences in life are exactly what you make of them, and that you’d damn well better make something entertaining out of them if you plan on staying sane.
As a local, the influx of obnoxious tourists and the piles of grimy parade debris that attend Mardi Gras’ festivities grow irritating and tiresome at times; but if the spirit of the season is what’s reminded me of the productive and life-sustaining value of shaking things up and turning them upside-down, I think that I’ve certainly found a reason to celebrate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the deadline of a 20,000-word thesis is approaching, sometimes Katy Perry covers are the only place to turn.
“Listening to Glee versions of popular songs, particularly [Glee’s version of] ‘Firework,’ was oddly inspiring,” said Shaun T. Vigil ’11, who credits music in his ability to get through his History and Literature senior thesis. “Also, Kelly Clarkson winning American Idol [is the] most inspirational video of all time.”
To freshmen whose chief concern before spring break is the outcome of housing day, this might sound a bit outlandish, but for seniors whose thesis deadlines are looming, this race to the finish is a fact of life.
But it could be worse. Rebecca L. Gruskin ’11, a history concentrator, is still waiting to receive translations of key thesis materials. Her deadline is March 10.
She traveled abroad last summer to conduct interviews for her thesis, which focuses on Jordanian reactions to the Israel-Jordan peace treaty of 1994.
A professional translator helped her throughout her research and sent her most of her data, but she is still waiting on certain interviews. After calling the translator on Tuesday, she learned that he hadn’t checked his e-mail since he got married last fall.
“He told me, ‘Inshallah I’ll get them to you by Friday or Saturday,’” Gruskin said.
And as Vigil, the History and Literature concentrator, learned, there’s more to a thesis than simply writing it.
Because Vigil wrote about the transformation from adolescence to adulthood over the course of the Spiderman comic series, he needed a color printer to showcase images sprinkled throughout his thesis.
His thesis was due Tuesday at 4 p.m. in the Barker Center, but he didn’t finish printing in Hilles Library until 3:41 p.m., he said.
“The shuttle had already left so I sprinted to the Barker Center in 11 minutes after sleeping an average of two hours a night during the thesis process,” he said. He had never run faster in his life.
But not everyone’s thesis experience reads like a horror story.
Beatrice E. Liem ’11, an applied mathematics concentrator, said she is not terribly stressed about her thesis.
“I’m not far enough along to have that panic craze since I’m still doing data collection,” Liem said. Her thesis is due in April.
Michael A. Baskin ’11, a Social Studies concentrator, also took an optimistic view on thesis-writing, saying he was enjoying the comfort of his House.
“Writing a thesis is great as long as you have the open and inclusive community of Dunster cheering you on,” he said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: MAR. 3, 2011
The Mar. 3 article "Seniors Face Looming Deadlines" incorrectly stated the length of Shaun T. Vigil's thesis. It is 20,000 words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Munching on a bountiful spread of sandwiches, sushi, and lightly fried portobello mushroom dumplings, staff and faculty from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences packed into the Faculty Room of University Hall for a cocktail event to recognize the service of 38 of their colleagues.
The event—in its second year, after FAS Dean Michael D. Smith established the program last year—salutes staff members throughout FAS for their commitment to the school. Staff members are anonymously recommended for the award by their other colleagues, who submit a letter of recommendation.
The 38 members, who Smith said “represent the full range of Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” were presented with a small, silver picture frame, and stood with Smith to receive applause from FAS staff members.
“I want to express my gratitude for many things the staff has done,” Smith said.
“It’s such a simple thing to take a minute to say thank you [yet] it’s such a rare thing that people [do it],” said Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, FAS dean of administration and finance. “We want to be able to take this time to say thank you to all the people here in FAS.”
Kirwan also acknowledged Smith for establishing the event.
The recipients of the award came from a wide array of divisions across FAS, including information technology, the Registrar’s Office, the Observatory, and the Harvard Forest.
Recipients said that it was not only a personal distinction, but also a recognition of the department at which they work.
“For me, it’s recognition of the Information Systems Department,” said Director of Information Security Jay Carter, who received an award. “We’re making sure that all the data is protected.”
Carter received the award for having “furthered the customer service and leadership image of FAS IT” at a time of IT transition.
The award recipients had served Harvard from as short as two years to at least 20 years.
Jessica R. Martin, sponsored programs portfolio manager at the Department of Physics, said that she was at first “shocked” when she heard she received the award because she has worked at the department for only two and a half years.
Last June, Smith honored 50 FAS staff members with the Dean’s Distinction Award in a similar ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard community gathered yesterday in the Barker Center to celebrate the inauguration of the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library, a new translation series produced and distributed by Harvard University Press that will make the written achievements of medieval cultures more readily available to scholars and general readers in the English-speaking world.
The Medieval Library formally debuts with the publication of three works: a volume containing two separate manuscripts of secular Latin poetry, the full “Beowulf” manuscript, and The Pentateuch of Saint Jerome’s Latin translation of the Bible paired with the 17th century Douay-Rheims translation.
Three more volumes are scheduled to be published later in the spring.
The inauguration coincides with the 10th anniversary of the I. Tatti Renaissance Library and the 100th anniversary of the Loeb Classical Library.
The Medieval Library is modeled after the 512-volume Loeb Classical Library and was born from the initiative of Classics Professor Jan M. Ziolkowski.
When Ziolkowski was named Director of the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in 2007, he expressed his desire to fill an existing gap in the collections of the I. Tatti and Loeb libraries and create a defined space for medieval literature within the academic community.
Ziolkowski was in attendance at the celebration event.
He expressed his gratitude to the Harvard University Press for their support and vocalized his vision for the Medieval Library.
“I would like [the Medieval Library to give hope to scholars just starting their career and help them generate ideas for their research,” he said.
“I hope that [this series] will foster an environment in which the works can be read and appreciated for their beauty.”
Ziolkowski also noted that the creation of this series is an affront to the belief that the humanities are in danger.
“I sometimes worry that we are living in dark times for the humanities,” he said.
“But this cannot happen, because if we lose the humanities, we lose our humaneness.”
Director of the Harvard University Library Robert C. Darnton ’60 and Founder and General Editor of the I Tatti Renaissance Library James Hankins were also in attendance. Both praised Ziolkowski’s initiative and the collection’s significance within the academic community.
“[This new collection] is making classics live again to become part of a growing world,” Darnton said.
Hankins also addressed the longevity of humanities studies and the contribution that the Medieval Library presents.
“The entire Renaissance is built on the belief that the classics were going downhill and in reviving Latin and Greek [works] you’ll have [another] Renaissance, I hope,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have provided loose guidelines to departments for long-term financial planning that foresee a growth in the distribution from the University endowment to pre-2008 nominal levels by 2018.
The guidelines plan for 2 to 3 percent yearly growth in the distribution to FAS, or the amount the school receives annually from the University-wide endowment, according to department administrators in FAS.
Administrators in FAS caution that the timetable is tentative, requiring a consistent increase in the endowment for the next ten years. The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, adjusts the amount withdrawn from the endowment based on its performance.
But a distribution increase would relieve some of the financial pressure on FAS, which receives roughly half of its budget from the endowment and is still recovering from an original $220 million deficit.
“It means that we can take a deep breath instead of holding our breath,” Department Administrator for History of Art and Architecture Deanna Dalrymple said in an interview last week.
“It’s not a cut. It’s not a static situation. And it’s at least a number in the positive column,” she added.
In the wake of the financial crisis, the University endowment fell about 30 percent, putting pressure on the budgets of schools across the University which depend, in part, on funds from the endowment.
At the time, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith asked departments to cut 15 percent of their respective budgets, which were followed by additional cuts the next year. During that period, more than 75 staff positions were eliminated and faculty hires were greatly reduced.
FAS is still facing a $35 million deficit, which Smith has said he expects to close by the end of fiscal year 2012.
“We’re not out of it yet—and we still need to feel pressed to maintain our cut budgets,” said another department administrator, who asked to remain anonymous to preserve her relations with the administration. “But the increase is certainly a positive step.”
Dalrymple, the History of Art and Architecture administrator, said that an increased FAS budget could “mean more opportunities for academic enhancement” that might include lectures and symposia.
The departmental budgets should be concerned about more than “buying paper clips,” Dalrymple said. The growth in budget will support “putting more focus on the academic ambition,” she said.
The recent planning guidelines follow reports from last fall that the University has advised schools to plan for a 4 percent rise in the value of the endowment distribution for the 2012 fiscal year, marking the first yearly increase since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008.
The distribution fell 8 percent in the 2010 fiscal year, dropping another 12 percent for the following 2011 fiscal year, reflecting the precipitous drop in the value of Harvard’s endowment between June 2008 and June 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson will be a Spring Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Politics during the week of March 28, the IOP announced yesterday.
During his time at the IOP, Richardson will deliver the 2011 Corliss Lamont Lecture, which features a leader who has played a role in diminishing the likelihood of nuclear war.
He will also meet with students and speak in several public policy classes both at the College and the Kennedy School.
Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, president of the IOP, said that he thinks Richardson’s diverse experiences will give students first-hand exposure to a wide variety of state, national, and international issues.
Richardson began his political career as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, where he represented New Mexico’s third district from 1983 to 1997.
He then went on to be the United States Ambassador to the United Nations from 1997 to 1998. Due to his diplomatic work, Richardson has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize five times.
In 1998, he was appointed Secretary of Energy by former President Clinton. After the end of the Clinton administration,
Richardson became the governor of New Mexico in 2003, a position that he held until he reached the term limit this year.
Richardson made another bid for the national stage when he was a candidate for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination before ultimately dropping out of the race due to a lack of support.
Richardson was also a nominee for the position of Commerce Secretary in President Obama’s administration. He withdrew his name from the candidacy due to a federal grand jury investigation, although ultimately Richardson did not face charges.
Richardson’s spring fellowship will not be the first time he has been involved in life at Harvard. He served as a member of the IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee from 1999 to 2005.
C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, director of the IOP, said that Richardson’s depth of experience is unparalleled even in the world of politics.
“What’s exciting about him is that he is an expert in so many areas and has such a diversity of experiences,” Grayson said. “I’m hard pressed to think of anybody else who has been a cabinet secretary, UN ambassador, member of Congress, governor of a state, and a presidential candidate.”
Members of the IOP community said they thought Richardson’s presence on campus would inspire students to get involved in politics.
“Governor Bill Richardson is a very dynamic and charismatic figure and he’s going to energize the program and bring a lot of excitement about politics to campus,” said Cyrus B. Kornfeld ’12, co-chair of the Fellows and Study Groups Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following Harvard’s announcement last week that its early action admissions program would return next fall, undergraduates—except for seniors—at the College seemed to react with a collective shrug, never having an opportunity to apply early to Harvard themselves.
But members of the senior class—the last class that was able to apply to Harvard College under early action—tended to celebrate the program’s return, often arguing that it made the college admission process less stressful.
After Virginia Ng ’11 was accepted to Harvard, she submitted applications to only five of the original 10 schools to which she had planned on applying. Mallika Khandelwal ’11 submitted no other applications.
Ng said that she saw both advantages and disadvantages in the early action program, saying that her high school had provided her with the resources necessary to apply to Harvard early.
“Boston Latin was very special,” she said.
In contrast, Ng mentors a student at a different public school in Boston who met his guidance counselor for the first time during September of his senior year of high school.
“If you haven’t met your guidance counselor until September and have to take the SAT and apply by November, it becomes a big rush,” she said. “It is a disadvantage for people with fewer resources and are of lower socioeconomic status.”
Harvard eliminated the program starting with the Class of 2012, expressing concern that early action unfairly disadvantaged students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
Members of the freshman, sophomore, and junior classes expressed varying degrees of disinterest in the return of early action.
“You apply early, you apply regular, it’s the same,” said Gavin D. Pascarella ’13.
Other students felt that the absence of early action removed pressure to finish applications in November.
Douglas M. Bright ’13 said he would not have applied early, even if he had the opportunity.
He cited the desire to perfect his applications to top-tier schools as a reason to apply during the regular cycle.
“I only applied early to what, I guess, would be the safety schools that I had on my list,” he said.
Other students saw early action as a way for applicants to convince the admission committee that a particular school was his or her top choice.
“I think [early action] will only be a good thing. I think you will get a more passionate student body,” said Jordan A. Feyko ’14.
Bryan Cortez ’13 said he thought the Class of 2016 would be more competitive as a result of the change, making the student body stronger overall.
“If you have a more competitive class, you have a more excellent class,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He’s a best-selling author and teaches one of the largest introductory courses at Harvard. But Psychology Professor Steven A. Pinker says that during his office hours, he finds himself awaiting the knock of an intrepid student.
Pinker says that over the course of the semester, only one or two students will show up at his scheduled office hours. Another five to ten will make appointments.
The administration of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, coming away from a debilitating budget deficit, has returned its focus to strengthening the school’s commitment to teaching and learning—a campaign that includes building student relations with the top faculties in the world.
But Pinker isn’t unique in his situation at the College. Harvard professors interviewed, who teach some of the largest introductory courses, say they often spend their office hours alone.
EMBARASSED TO JUST GO
“When I’m standing on the stage in Sanders, I do feel very distant,” says Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who teaches Ec 10, the introductory economics course.
He says that this perceived distance may keep students from approaching him outside of class—only two or three come to his office hours each week.
“I suspect there is something of a divide,” says Pinker, echoing Mankiw’s comment on large courses. ”Some students just feel bashful.”
Many students say they are concerned that their understanding of the material is not advanced enough to engage in a worthwhile discussion with their professor.
And in courses that break out into a multitude of sections, students acknowledge that reaching out to the sole (and often high-profile) professor can be intimidating.
“I’d be embarrassed to just go and ask questions about reading I was confused about and waste the professor’s time,” Ec 10 student Celestine E. Warren ’14 says.
But Economics Lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron says that professors are prepared for even the simplest questions, and he encouraged students to ask basic questions so that they might be able to learn to ask harder ones.
Ec 10 student Paul A. Leroux ’14 says he once stopped by Mankiw’s office hours, but his section leader is still his go-to source for questions about class work.
“Mankiw has always been pretty approachable. He couldn’t have been friendlier,” said Leroux, who said they had a two hour conversation.
“I just haven’t had relevant enough questions,” he says. “I would like to go again in the future, but if it’s between that and finishing a problem set, I’d be more inclined to finish that problem set,” he says.
YOU AND US JUST TALKING
But departments across the College are brainstorming how to draw students to their faculty.
The lack of interaction between overworked students and busy professors troubles Psychology Professor Mahzarin R. Banaji, the head tutor in the Psychology Department
“I know [students] are all running in many different directions, but what Harvard would like to do is to create much more interaction between undergraduates and faculty,” says Banaji.
“I do want to see more of you and us just talking together,” she says.
While the office hours system is unlikely to change in the near future, Banaji says the department has developed new programs to foster communication between concentrators and faculty.
The Psychology Department now hosts monthly dinners with a faculty member and ten to fifteen students in an undergraduate house.
Banaji says both faculty members and students are “having a blast” at these dinners.
While some departments have found methods to foster student-faculty relationships, Miron says large class sizes remain a fundamental problem behind poor office hours attendance.
“For me, the ideal way to promote student/faculty communication is to have smaller classes, so students and faculty interact in a way that is natural, important, and useful. This then provides a foundation for additional discussion, friendship, and collaboration,” Miron says. “It just becomes the norm for students and faculty to interact.”
Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell says that the department is currently offering an increasing number of small classes through the recently reinstated junior seminar program, which was cut in the wake of the financial crisis.
ALTERNATIVE ENCOURAGEMENT
Some professors have undertaken their own creative adjustments to ensure students come to their office hours.
Biology Professor Robert A. Lue, who teaches the introductory course Life Science 1b, says that holding office hours in Annenberg has helped encourage students to stop by with their questions­—attendance last semester ranged from four to fifteen students per session.
Biology Professor Daniel L. Hartl says that he hangs around after lecture, and that’s when he gets most of his face time with students.
“I was told when I arrived here that there was a genuine, palpable lack of students at offices hours,” says Government Professor Eric A. Beerbohm, who teaches Government 10: “Foundations of Political Theory.”
But he says that he maintains a steady stream of four or five students per week.
The philosophical discussions of the class overflow into office hours, but he says that reminders and encouragement to come may be the strongest motivator.
“I found that what really changed it, was all you really have to do is ask them to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomores and juniors who applied to transfer from their current residence to a different House were notified of the outcome of their petitions last week. While some were assigned to their first-choice Houses or another of their top preferences, others were told that they will remain—at least until the next application cycle later this spring—in their current Houses.
Gina D. Burke, director of housing in the Office of Student Life, said that her office sets a cap on the number of students who can transfer into each House and the number who will be allowed to leave.
According to Lowell House Administrator Elizabeth G. Terry, these figures are based on the gender and class year breakdown in each House.
“It’s really frustrating that I can’t choose to live somewhere else,” said Naor E. Brown ’13, a Crimson business editor whose petition to transfer from Winthrop to Quincy was denied. “They say it’s a random process, but obviously it kind of sucks.”
Joshua R. Wortzel ’13, who sought unsuccessfully to move from Pforzheimer to Lowell, said that his application was denied because of “a disproportionate number of sophomores” currently living in Lowell.
“It’s not that bad to [commute],” said Wortzel, who had hoped to be closer to the Harvard Community Garden and the research laboratory where he spends much of his time each week. “It just would’ve been convenient.”
Some River Houses also had more would-be emigrants than they could accommodate.
Terry said that of the 11 students who wished to leave Lowell, only seven were approved.
Quincy House Administrator Larry J. Peterson estimated that 80 to 90 percent of the “around a dozen” students who wanted to exit Quincy were approved. Peterson said that approximately the same number wanted to move into the House, and the acceptance rate for entrants was the same.
Burke declined to provide the overall number of students who applied for interhouse transfers or the specific caps for each House.
Though the transfer application lets students select from a dozen reasons for desiring a change—including such unlikely options as “Do Not Want a Single” and “Be Closer to the Student Organization Center at Hilles”—administrators said that for most students, the cause is social.
“It’s more about where your friends are than what House it is,” Peterson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Reserve Officers’ Training Corps will be formally recognized by Harvard Friday after an almost 40-year hiatus, the University announced Thursday. University President Drew G. Faust and Navy Secretary Ray E. Mabus are set to sign an agreement Friday that will recognize Naval ROTC on campus.
“Our renewed relationship affirms the vital role that the members of our Armed Forces play in serving the nation and securing our freedoms, while also affirming inclusion and opportunity as powerful American ideals,” Faust said in a statement. “It broadens the pathways for students to participate in an honorable and admirable calling and in so doing advances our commitment to both learning and service.”
Although ROTC will be officially recognized, a unit will not necessarily be established on campus, and Harvard cadets will continue to train at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Previously, University officials said that they would not recognize the program until “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military policy which banned gays and lesbians from openly serving the military—was lifted. Since Congress repealed the ban in December, Faust and other officials have been in discussions with the Pentagon about bringing the program back to campus.
According to the agreement’s terms, a director of Naval ROTC will be appointed at Harvard, and the University will provide some funding for the program.
The University is also pursuing talks with the other services about resuming official relations, according to a press release.
“We are going to get aggressive about reaching out to the other services,” said Kevin “Kit” Parker, chair of the newly created ROTC implementation committee. Parker is an associate Professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Military budget concerns are the biggest barrier preventing the return of other services. Army ROTC programming around the country may contract in the future, said Parker, who served as an Army major for three tours in Afghanistan.
While this may make it difficult for the Army to establish a presence on campus, Parker said he believes “Harvard should reach out and make the Army an offer they can’t refuse.”
In 1969, Harvard expelled ROTC amidst a wave of student and faculty anger over the Vietnam War. Later, the University justified its continued split with the military on the basis of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which Harvard considered in violation of its non-discrimination policy.
In recent years, relations with the military have warmed significantly. Since 2008, Faust has attended the spring ROTC commissioning ceremony, continuing a precedent set by her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers. During a campus event with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael G. Mullen in November, Faust made clear that ROTC would be welcomed back when the military changed its policy on gays and lesbians.
But until Thursday, that recognition had not been made official.
SHORT-TERM BENEFITS
For the last several decades, cadets have had to overcome a number of obstacles in order to participate in ROTC. The recognition of the program will result in increased access and benefits for current cadets at Harvard, including use of facilities, according to Parker.
“Students have had to struggle against adversity to serve the nation and also get a degree from Harvard, and I am so proud of them,” Parker said.
Previously, a group of alumni had provided financial support for Harvard cadets. Now, Harvard will step in and provide funds for the program.
The University will also provide transportation to MIT for cadets, who will continue to take military science classes there. In addition, Harvard facilities can now be used for physical training and drills.
Chris W. Higgins ’11, an Army ROTC cadet, said that access to Harvard athletic fields for physical training is especially important and will make training more convenient for cadets.
Phillip A. Acevedo ’13 said that even though training at MIT has posed a number of challenges, “the cadets in ROTC make it work.”
“They don’t really complain that they have to go to MIT. They have their heads on right,” he added.
Most importantly, recognition of ROTC is a powerful symbolic gesture toward the military and could open the door to the establishment of an ROTC unit on campus.
“The symbolism of Harvard recognizing ROTC is huge, and so is cooperation between the nation’s finest university and the military,” Acevedo said. “We need bright leaders in the military. It is how we win and how we maintain our safety and that of our allies.”
Higgins added that he feels that recognition of ROTC is “great for the military, great for Harvard, and great for the country.”
STUDENT INTEREST?
Still, a unit will likely not be established on campus unless student interest in participating increases. As of now, just 20 students at the College are enrolled in ROTC.
“I think the big question is: As the relationship between Harvard and the military becomes closer, will more students see the military as a viable career path?” Higgins asked.
But many students said that recognition of ROTC may increase the program’s exposure on campus, potentially leading to more interest.
Victoria L. Migdal ’12, an Army cadet, said that she hopes the recognition will increase awareness of the program.
“I don’t know if it will have that much of an impact initially,” Acevedo said. “Hopefully interest will increase and eventually we will have our own unit,”
The issue of lack of interest is a “chicken and egg” problem, according to Anne D. Neal ’77, president of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, a group that has sent a letters to the Harvard Corporation pushing for recognition of ROTC.
Higgins said he believes there should be “some sort of marketing campaign” to increase awareness of the program on campus and that current cadets can play a major role in this effort.
“Recognition makes the military a viable career track,” Higgins said. “This is something that Harvard students can do apart from just banking and consulting.”
Capt. Paul E. Mawn ’63 (Ret.), chairman of Harvard Advocates for ROTC, has suggested that Harvard retool its admissions focus to target and recruit students who would be interested in the military.
But Parker said he believes that “we have to hunker down and build this program first.”
“We have to put Harvard’s assets on the table and say it is worth your while to train your cadets here,” he added.
Parker said he believes that with recognition, the admissions office will have more traction in communities where the military is highly valued. “It is time to scoop that talent,” he said.
Higgins said he believes that Harvard already has strong ties to the military that make it an appealing choice. Higgins—who said he was choosing between West Point and Harvard as a high school senior—said that he has been surprised by the opportunities he has had to interact with top members of the military through Harvard’s graduate schools.
“When I was a high school senior I didn’t understand what a great breeding ground Harvard can be for the military,” he said.
CONCERNS REMAIN
But members of the Harvard queer community have expressed concern that the University will violate its non-discrimination policy by recognizing ROTC. Currently, the military does not allow  trans and intersex individuals to enlist as it considers gender identity disorder—the psychological classification that describes transgenderism—and intersexism to be medical disqualifications. Some opponents of recognizing ROTC contend that this policy is discriminatory.
Though openly gay and lesbian individuals are expected to be able to serve after top government officials certify the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the new policy will not apply to trans and intersex and individuals.
“Here’s the fundamental question the administration has to answer: Given our non-discrimination policy, what if a trans student wants to serve?” said Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11. “We all know what the outcome would be—they’d be disqualified. How does the school answer to that? How does the school answer when a student cannot join a recognized activity because of their gender identity? We can’t debate that this is a violation of our own non-discrimination policy.”
“I’m very disappointed,” added Jia Hui Lee ’12, a member of the Trans Task Force. “Now, the least the administration can do is admit that they have and will continue to ignore its trans students.”
Lee and other students plan to protest against this decision outside Massachusetts Hall tomorrow from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. The agreement between the University and the Pentagon will be signed this afternoon at Loeb House.
Chan, Lee, and other student leaders met with Faust’s staff to discuss their concerns earlier this week. Both Chan and Lee said that while the staffers were very receptive to their input, they said they felt in the meeting as if the administration had already decided it was going to recognize ROTC.
“It didn’t feel like there was ground to compromise,” said Chan. “For me, that’s disconcerting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One thousand fifty minutes played, 1870 points scored, and 873 rebounds grabbed. After 26 games, the final outcome of a remarkable season will rest in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s own hands.
After overcoming an 11-point halftime deficit to snatch a thrilling comeback victory against Brown and enduring a heartbreaking one-point loss at Yale on last weekend’s two-game road trip, the team returns to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend, where it is 12-0 this season.
There the Crimson (21-5, 10-2 Ivy) will take on conference foes Penn (12-13, 6-5) and Princeton (22-5, 10-1) Friday and Saturday night, respectively.
Dropped to second place in the Ivy standings after being snakebitten at Yale, the Crimson will guarantee itself at least a share of the Ivy League title if it wins both games.
“As a team, I believe we got ourselves ready,” said junior co-captain Oliver McNally, who hit the game-winning shot with 11 seconds remaining the last time the team played the Quakers. “We need to keep charging forward. The season is coming to a close, and we need to be at our best this weekend.”
Penn is coming off a loss against Cornell, but it will be visiting with a chip on its shoulders, after losing to the Crimson by only one point in a double-overtime thriller on Feb 5. The Quakers are led by starting point guard Zack Rosen, who ranks third among all Ivy League players in scoring—averaging 14.8 points a game—and second in assists—averaging 5.5 assists a game.
Rosen will pose a tough matchup for Harvard sophomore guard Brandyn Curry, who has been very effective as the Crimson’s starting point guard this season.
“[Rosen] has really good handles, and he’s also very good at getting to the free throw line,” Curry said, “So I’ll have to stay out of foul trouble and try to make things difficult for him.”
The Crimson will also have to defend against Quakers’ senior forward Jack Eggleston, who is one of the best in-and-out forwards in the league, averaging 8.2 rebounds a game while shooting 43.8 percent from beyond the arc.
“Eggleston is one of the best bigs in the league,” McNally said. “But I think the most important thing is containing Rosen, and not letting him get into the lane and make plays for others.”
Provided that the team can hold its own against Penn, Saturday night’s regular season finale against Princeton will be a tougher challenge.
“Princeton moves the ball very well,” Curry said. “We’ll have to defend the whole 35 seconds against them—not give them any easy buckets on backdoors.”
According to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the key to playing the Tigers is defending the post.
“We’re going to have to do a better job of defending them in the post,” Amaker said. “[Kareem] Maddox and [Ian] Hummer did a great job against us [last time]. They got to where they wanted to get to and were very efficient around the goal.”
Maddox and Hummer combined for 31 points on 13-of-21 shooting last time the two teams met.
In addition to its two inside threats, Princeton also has two guards, senior Dan Mavraides and junior Douglas Davis, who average double-digits in scoring. Given such a balanced Tigers offense, Curry said it’s important that the Crimson dictate the tempo of the game.
“We want to push the ball,” Curry said. “Princeton likes to run it slow, but we definitely want to keep the tempo fast-paced.”
The first time Harvard met Penn and Princeton this season, the team was able to jump out to first-half leads. But it had difficulties closing out both games in the second half. With an NCAA tournament birth at stake, it will be important for the Crimson to shake off last Saturday’s loss early, and keep its feet on the pedal all weekend.
“We have full confidence,” Curry said. “We’re ready to take care of business at home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After sweeping St. Lawrence last weekend in the ECAC quarterfinals, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team will square off against Dartmouth tonight at Bright Hockey Center for a chance to advance to the championship match.
The Crimson (17-10-4, 14-5-3 ECAC) comes into the game having won three of its last four games, but the Big Green (21-10-0, 15-7-0) is streaking too, having won seven of its last eight.
“They are playing well. We are playing well,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It should be a great game.”
This match is important for both teams, because it gives them a chance to compete for the ECAC championship and the accompanying automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which both teams likely need to make the tournament.
The Crimson and Dartmouth are also huge hockey rivals, and they have faced each other 76 times. Harvard trails the Big Green with a 35-39-2 head-to-head record during those games.
The Crimson won both of the teams’ previous matchups this season, but since that time, both teams have made significant changes and improvements.
“It’s hard [for us] to use those games because we played them back in November,” Harvard tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “You just always know it’s a big rivalry. Beating them three times will be tough.”
The match features two of the highest scoring teams in the ECAC, so a defensive push might prove to be the deciding factor.
The Crimson will look to keep up its recent offensive success, having tallied 24 goals in the last four games. Harvard’s offensive attack has been led this season by Buesser and sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey who have recorded 15 goals and 14 goals, respectively.
In the quarterfinal matches, both forwards played well as Buesser recorded 3 goals and 2 assists while Dempsey notched 4 goals of her own.
Dartmouth’s offense has been paced by junior forward Kelly Foley and sophomore forward Camille Dumais, two of the top ten scorers in the conference.
Both teams will be featuring ECAC All-League selections, which were announced on Monday. For the Crimson, Dempsey and sophomore forward Josephine Pucci were named to the second team while tri-captains Liza Ryabkina and Leanna Coskren were named to the third team. Freshman defenseman Marissa Gedman was also named to the all-rookie team. For the Big Green, Foley and sophomore defenseman Sasha Nanji earned second and third-team honors, respectively.
Playing at home will be beneficial to the Crimson as it has posted an 8-3-1 record at Bright.
Harvard will look to jump on top early; the team has posted a record of 13-1-0 when scoring first and a 4-9-4 mark when it falls behind early.
“We want to come out fast in the first period…and take away the team’s momentum,” Buesser said.“It’s worked well in the first two games.”
The Crimson was penalized 17 times in the two quarterfinal games and seven times in its regular season finale, so it will be looking to reduce the number of penalties.
“These games should be decided 5-on-5, but we’re still going to be ready with our power play and penalty kill,” Stone said.
Even with the number of penalties that Harvard has recorded, it has only given up three power play goals in the last three games. This could be important, as Dartmouth has the second-best power play in the conference.
In practice this week, the team has focused on battling against the mobile defensemen of the Big Green and polishing up its game.
“We have been working on our neutral zone forecheck to run them out of time and space and force turnovers,” Buesser said.
The winner will either play Cornell or Quinnipiac who face off on Thursday night in Ithaca. The loser will be eliminated, most likely without an NCAA tournament berth.
“We just need to play our game and be ready to go,” Stone said. “At the end of the day, it is all about executing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard squash looks to repeat its sweep of the men’s and women’s national individual titles at the Collegiate Squash Association (CSA) Individual Championships this weekend at Dartmouth College.
The Crimson women’s team finished up its regular season two weeks ago, coming away from the CSA Team Championships ranked No. 2 after losing to No. 1 Yale in the finals.
The men’s team hosted the tournament last weekend, earning fifth place while Trinity claimed the title for the 13th straight year.
As the regular reason ends, there is one last tournament for individuals that qualify and want to participate: the CSA’s Individual Championships.
The tournament allows nine players from a single team to compete for the individual title. The Harvard men’s and women’s teams both have enough points for everyone to qualify for the tournament, but not everyone will compete due to injury or illness.
“It’s up to the individual whether they want to play or not,” said first-year Harvard coach Mike Way. “Because both sides are so strong, [everyone is] eligible to play if they so wish.”
The top eight on the men’s side and the top seven on the women’s side have decided to compete.
Last year, the Crimson came away with both the men’s and women’s Individual Championship titles, as Colin West ’10 won for the men and sophomore Laura Gemmell took home the women’s title.
Gemmell will be returning this year as the No. 1 seed and still undefeated in her college career.
“Laura will absolutely be intending to win the tournament,” Way said.
On the men’s side, look for freshman Gary Power who is Harvard’s highest seed for the tournament. Power will be looking to make the semifinals or better.
“Maybe finals, if I play really well,” Power said.
In the tournament, each player can play up to five rounds. The weekend is divided into two draws, A and B. The top 32 seeded players are in the A draw, and the remaining players who qualified and want to participate are placed in the B draw.
“It’s gonna be really tough,” captain Alisha Mashruwala said. “The A draw is all of the top seeds. You can play people you’ve never played before. You’re trying to play your best squash, see what you’ve got, and try to compete.”
“If you don’t [play against] a top seed early, then you can move your way through [the tournament],” Way added.
If players meet the No. 1 seed in the first or second round, it is more difficult to get into the later stages of the tournament.
Both teams took some time off from training after team nationals, but they are beginning training again to keep their fitness up and to have a good performance.
“I think it goes without saying that you’ve got to be bloody fit and have a lot of belief,” Way said. “If you’ve got the game and you’ve got the fitness, then it’s about where you are on the day mentally.”
Different players have different expectations. Mashruwala hopes to make it into the top ten players, which are named the All-Americans.
Gemmell has her eye on the prize and expects to meet the same opponent in the finals as last year, then-junior Pamela Hathway of Trinity.
“It was really exciting to win it last year as a freshman,” Gemmell said. “This year, I know exactly who the competition is. Having that experience last year has prepared me more for this year, and I’m really excited.”
Coach Way thinks the individuals slotted to compete are prepared, but emphasizes the importance of the mental side of play.
“Getting your head into the fighting spirit is a given [for success],” he said.
The Crimson players’ individual rankings certainly stand for themselves. Power and Gemmell look to be the leaders as they enter the tournament, but other players, both from Harvard and other schools, are looking to compete and play their best squash, and hopefully bring home the titles.
“When it comes to individual Nationals, you’re still representing Harvard,” Power said. “Of course, you are hoping to get the best for yourself, but you also want to win for Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the men’s basketball team’s regular season wrapping up at home this weekend against Penn and Princeton, the Back Page gives you an opportunity to meet junior co-captain Oliver McNally, one of the team’s starting guards. In this exclusive interview, McNally reveals his pre-game playlist, a time when he was posterized by a high school player, and his apparent resemblance to a character in “The Social Network.” Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Oliver McNally
Year: 2012
Stats: This season, McNally has started all 26 games and is currently shooting 91 percent from the free throw line, putting him at fifth in the NCAA. McNally is averaging 9.8 points per game, 3.3 assists per game, 3.5 rebounds per game, and 1.2 blocks per game, while averaging 32.0 minutes.  McNally is shooting 48.3 percent from the field and a team best 43.8 percent behind the arc.
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
I usually eat pasta with a mix of marinara-alfredo, a chicken salad, vegetables and a mix of Powerade and water.
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I'm pretty weird with my pre-game music and could be the only one without Drake blaring through Beats by Dre headphones. But two songs I listen to before every game if I remember to charge my iPod are “Iris” by The Goo Goo Dolls and “Daylight” by Matt and Kim.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
At Columbia—being from San Francisco, I don't have many friends in the Northeast, but my brother and a lot of people I know live in NYC so playing there in front of them always is a fun time.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
I don't think I can let you in the privacy of our locker room but there's a lot of music, so too many guys feel the need to rap and sing a long. Keith Wright is guilty of this, but he is actually talented so I guess it's okay (listen at theeKDub on Youtube).
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
I got dunked on really badly in a pick-up game by a recruit last year. For those of you who have never played basketball, there is nothing worse in life then getting dunked on.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I guess I'm most like a pterodactyl. At a game earlier in the season, there were fans right behind our bench that yelled that I looked like a pterodactyl version of Justin Bieber. Bigtime hit to my self-confidence.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Since the Social Network came out, a lot of people yell at me about looking like the actor who plays Eduardo.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I played lacrosse until 8th grade and had a lot of fun playing it so probably lacrosse. If you add the fact that Christian Coates is on the team, it makes it a no-brainer.
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
Whatever position would make Hermione want me.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Jeremy Lin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Good news keeps rolling in for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
For his big role in last week’s wins over Brown, Clarkson, and St. Lawrence, senior goaltender Ryan Carroll earned the title of “MLX Skates Goaltender of the Week,” given weekly to the top netminder in the ECAC. Carroll’s award comes just a week after sophomore forward Danny Biega took home the prize for ECAC Player of the Week.
In each of last week’s contests, the senior came up big, doing just enough to lift the Crimson to victory.
Carroll’s best performance of the week might have been his first. In the final period against Brown, as Harvard held onto a 2-0 lead, the Bears fired a flurry of shots, tallying 20 in the period as compared to Harvard’s one. But Carroll held strong, only letting one shot find the back of the net en route to a 2-1 win.
Over the weekend, the senior continued his high level of play, allowing just four goals on 60 shots to beat Clarkson and St. Lawrence.
In the three games, Carroll saved a whopping 95 percent of shots that came his way.
He and the rest of the Crimson hockey team will be in action again this weekend, as the squad heads to Potsdam in upstate New York to face off against Clarkson in the first round of the ECAC playoffs.

Picture Harvard in late April. Annenberg is overcrowded, red folders abound, and an unusually large number of dull lectures and presentations are advertised across campus. It all adds up to one thing—prefrosh weekend.
This year, Visitas, formerly called the April Visiting Program, is taking a new approach to planning those annual lectures designed to entice prospective students. Instead of letting professors pick the topics of the talks which they deliver to introduce students to the academic offerings at Harvard, the Undergraduate Admissions Council is asking current undergraduates what "big questions" they would like faculty members to answer.
The student who suggests the three best questions will win a $10 gift card to J.P. Licks. Since there's a prize on the line, Flyby tried to think of a few ideas. What's going on the Middle East? Where is the Middle East, actually? How do WikiLeaks happen? Why is Charlie Sheen still on TV?
If you think you have ideas that are better than these, submit them before noon today!
