After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's a classic dilemma: You've finally turned in that take-home exam and you sense that the occasion calls for a celebration, but all your blockmates are busy and the trek to Berryline seems daunting. Before you turn to the time-honored solution of logging into Netflix, Flyby has a few suggestions for celebrating in a more functional way—here are beautiful, alternative creations that you can make yourself.
We talked to Harvard's resident crafting queen, Marjorie Lacombe '13. Founder of the student-run i like fall, Lacombe also runs The Kipi Blog, a personal site for chronicling her creative endeavors.
Think Harvard students are too busy for DIY projects? Lacombe would want you to think again.
"While DIY projects are a great way to take a break from schoolwork, it's not actually a complete departure. When you're writing essays, you have to analyze evidence and construct arguments from that. When you create a project, you think about the materials you have to work with and how you can construct a beautiful, one-of-a-kind project from them," Lacombe says.
So take those analytical skills you've been honing all semester and give some of these Marjorie-approved projects a whirl:
- Greeting cards: great for blockmates, graduating seniors, and friends of any kind.
- iPad case: elevating its pedestrian materials to a cute, functional accessory
- Jewelry organizer: because you've been promising to "do something" about the top of your dresser for a full year now
- Kaleidoscope earrings: using just two materials, likely ones you have lying around your dorm room!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s recent announcement that the New England Primate Research Center run by Harvard Medical School will be shut down by 2015 leaves us with mixed feelings. Certainly, the center was not without problems. Last February its track record of animal mistreatment earned it a citation for violations of the Animal Welfare Act by the United States Department of Agriculture, following the deaths of two monkeys. It goes without saying that the careless handling of test subjects was highly problematic, and doubtlessly warranted a change of practice and a newfound commitment to animal safety.
However, a complete shutdown of the center signifies that Harvard will be barred from participating in crucial efforts in basic scientific research in the years to come. One of only eight primate research centers sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the NEPRC is the sole research facility of its kind in the whole of the northeastern United States. If we are to take the University’s declaration that the center is to be closed because of financial uncertainties at face value, that further highlights the adverse outcomes of reductions in funding, and is especially relevant in light of the recent debate on sequestration.
Harvard’s ability to participate in a number of scientific endeavors will be crippled by the closure of the NEPRC: An example of this is the federal BRAIN Initiative recently kick-started by NIH, a large-scale effort in Brain Activity Mapping research whose stated goal is to build a functional map of human neural circuits by complementing the creation of a static connectome of the brain—that is, a map of the firing patterns of all neurons in the nervous central system under the effect of diverse stimuli. President Obama announced the nationwide launching of the brain initiative at the beginning of April in a speech that he gave at the White House.
Obama remarked how the BRAIN Initiative was partly inspired by the Human Genome Project in its approaches, and asserted that the deeper understanding of the brain’s system-wide dynamics to be acquires in the course of this large-scale endeavor will be “transformative.” Obama maintained that the BRAIN Initiative would possibly herald new advances in the treatment of diseases like Parkinson’s or autism. Indeed, other scientists have agreed with Obama’s enthusiastic stances, from Society for Neuroscience President Larry W. Swanson, to the group of scientists who initially proposed the initiative. Among these was Harvard Medical School Professor George M. Church, who made clear in a seminal collaborative paper published in Neuron that primate research would be a fundamental step of the BAM research efforts.
The very reason for which primates are crucial test subject—their evolutionary closeness to us—warrants extreme care in their treatment. The NEPRC has been run reprehensibly in the past, and future primate research efforts must be handled with greater care. However, it is regrettable that research tools are being powered down because of financial difficulties, especially on the eve of such pivotal research endeavors as the federal BRAIN Initiative. The closure of the NEPRC will mean that Harvard’s contribution in a project that might prove as important as the mapping of the human genome will be limited—a great misfortune for a large research university.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the 533,042 individuals stopped and frisked by the New York City Police Department last year, 87 percent were either black or Latino and 89 percent were completely innocent. If this is not considered racial profiling, then I don’t know what is.
Ever since the Supreme Court’s decision in Terry v. Ohio, NYPD officers have had the authority to stop people on the streets when there is reasonable cause to suspect that that individual is about to commit a crime. Officers have the power to frisk an individual when they suspect that he or she possesses a weapon.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NYPD continue to defend the stop and frisk policy as a way to keep the city safer, but because the overwhelming majority of those stopped are both minorities and innocents, there is a real cause for concern. To NYPD officers, every stop represents an insignificant and forgettable part of the day. If they find no criminal activity, as occurs the vast majority of the time, they move on and stop the next individual they deem suspicious. But the dehumanization that comes with being treated like a criminal can haunt the person for life.
With as many at 1,800 individuals stopped per day, one must wonder what each of these individuals did to be considered suspicious. Was it the type of clothes they were wearing? Did their skin color simply not match the neighborhood they happened to be in at the time? Or maybe, they just gave off some type of vague, subjective criminal vibe. The problem with the NYPD’s stop and frisk policy is that it is completely based on presumption. All one has to do is look like someone who might commit a crime in the eyes of an officer, and one can be legally stopped and frisked under the current status quo.
With such a broad definition of suspicious and with so much discretion in the hands of NYPD officers, the potential for abuse is boundless. For a long time, it’s been difficult for the public to sympathize with victims of stop and frisk since no personal stories of maltreatment had come to light. But in 2011, a young teen named Alvin, who had already been stopped earlier that day, decided to record the incident. Like the Rodney King video that broadcast to the world what police brutality meant in Los Angeles, this 17-year-old’s audio recording, which marked the first public recording of a New York stop and frisk in action, revealed troubling truths.
When listening to the audio, the first thing you might realize is that the ordeal is not as harmless as the name “stop and frisk” may mislead you to believe. The police officer shoves Alvin and proceeds to call him “a piece of shit” and “a fucking mutt.” He also threatens to arrest and “break [Alvin’s] fucking arm off.” This is what the city of New York calls a stop and frisk. If you ask me, this sounds more like a “stop, harass, intimidate, belittle, and abuse.”
It is time for Mayor Bloomberg and NYPD Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly to put an end to this cruel practice. New York’s stop and frisk policy is just one of many ways America continues to perpetuate institutional racism. We often like to think that our country is post-racial, but if you asked any minority who has been stopped in New York or any other major urban city, they’d tell you otherwise.
As cities continue to underserve public schools, black and Latino dropout rates will continue to remain high. Without a high school diploma, these young people must survive in a country that dedicates more resources to putting them behind bars than seeing that they can find a good job or pursue higher education.
The culture of mass incarceration endemic in cities such as New York can be compared to what Arizona tried to do with Senate Bill 1070. Signed into law in 2010, it gives law enforcement similar powers to detain an individual if  “reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States.” It made me proud to see President Obama strongly criticize this bill and the rest of the nation stand with him against it. They understand that what Arizona is doing violates both the 4th amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure and the 14th amendment’s equal protection of all people under the law.
We cannot stand idly by as 1,800 New Yorkers continue to racially profiled every day. I call on the president and defenders of civil liberties everywhere to stand up again, this time against the NYPD and its stop and frisk policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is much Harvard is good for: awkward conversations at the dentist, amping up your street cred with the Cambridge townies, procuring a wider showing at National Alcohol Screening Day than any varsity sporting event—the list goes on. Debatably one of its most enduring qualities, however, is its affinity for rejection.
Like me, you may have been under the ludicrous assumption that after surviving the college application process, the act of validating oneself through open-ended, unimaginative essay prompts would cease to be a core extracurricular. For incoming freshmen worried you may have to stop talking about how feeding needy children in Tanzania helped you discover the meaning of life, do not fret. The application process is here to stay. But if you thought applying to college was selective, try signing up for the overnight shift at the homeless shelter—who knew there were too many people trying to feed the hungry?
Harvard’s one-of-a-kind aptitude can turn any seemingly benign or inclusive endeavor into a chance to dull out another application and receive some much-coveted rejection. Take, for example, the friend-making process. If you thought meeting people was an individual-agency, anyone-can-do-it sort of thing, think again. Unless you’ve actively chosen to avoid popular American culture, you’ve probably heard of the Greek system—for those non-conformists out there, it basically entails excessive platonic flirting and a few numbers tacked on to your payments for the semester, in exchange for a contracted friend group, some Greek letters, and a chance to sport that original hand sign in any and all future photographs. Like most schools, Harvard has its own version of Greek life on campus. But, as this is Harvard, we’ve one-upped this semi-exclusive institution with one of yet greater exclusivity and prestige: Final Clubs. While anyone can rush a sorority or fraternity for a chance to be judged by one’s peers, one must first receive an invitation for the privilege of later being rejected by a Final Club.
Want to make friends the old fashion way? Don’t worry; there are plenty of other activities where rejection remains an option. Popular choices include Crimson Key, PAF, and First-Year-Outdoor Program. Their wide appeal allows them to take only a small portion of their applicants, leading students through an obstacle of application steps only to deny them in the end.
So you have no ready-made friends, no activities to drown your sorrows in, and a growing sense that you’re not as cool as you once thought. I’d say you have it pretty good. (Seriously.)
For a sizable portion of the student body, rejection is not a conceivable experience prior to stepping onto Harvard Yard. Sure, we may have been cut from the cup-stacking team or asked to lip sync during the sixth grade choir concert, but most of what we worked for, we got. Perhaps a life of moderate and largely unquestioned success leads to a false sense of pride and thus a subconscious belief that we will ultimately be rewarded for our efforts. By thoroughly acquainting us with rejection, Harvard crucially reminds us that this isn’t always the case.
Rejection’s intrinsic incorporation into every aspect of Harvard life can be a bit excessive. While being surrounded by so many passionate and over-qualified individuals is humbling and inspiring, it can also perpetuate serious feelings of inadequacy. As diverse as our backgrounds and interests may be, there is no denying the Harvard mold. Prior to arriving on campus, I was under the impression that J.Crew was a furniture store for old people. Now the only time I can walk outside without being immediately greeted by pastel and tweed is during finals week. The desire to find our place among the khakis and boat shoes can be overwhelming, and in a culture defined by judgment and competition, it’s impossible not to compare yourself to others. In doing so, we often end up substituting the activities that make us happy for ones we think we’re supposed to be doing.
But buying a pair of Sperrys and joining the most prestigious organizations won’t always help you find your niche. The quality of an organization isn’t defined by how exclusive it is, and surprisingly enough, joining activities for the sake of padding a resume isn’t very conducive to self-discovery.
Rejection’s essential benefit is that it forces you to try something else; while it may be a slap to your ego, it can lead you to new opportunities you may have otherwise overlooked. Contrary to popular belief, there are many great organizations at Harvard that are quite inclusive and simply don’t get as much attention. Go visit the Dudley Co-op for Naked Brunch if you don’t believe me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty-two percent of students accepted into Harvard’s class of 2017 have decided to attend Harvard—the highest yield in 44 years. The record yield comes despite the College’s cancellation of its Visitas program for admitted students in the aftermath of a security lockdown in the Greater Boston area.
According to a University press release, this year’s record yield means that all spots in the class of 2017 have been taken, although a “small number” of students may be accepted off of the waiting list later this month or in June.
In an interview with The Crimson, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 affirmed his commitment to bringing back the admitted students’ program, although he said his office reevaluated Visitas after observing the yield increase.
“It would be easy for people to perhaps wrongly conclude that Harvard cares less about its admitted students than the other institutions,” he said, explaining that canceling Visitas could send the wrong message to prospective students.
“In a way, our visiting program has become industry standard,” Fitzsimmons said.
This year’s Visitas program, which was scheduled to take place the weekend of April 20, was canceled after a massive manhunt for one of two marathon bombing suspects shut down Cambridge and the greater Boston area.
Fitzsimmons praised the Harvard community for coming together to talk to admitted students in the aftermath of the cancellation.
He said he believed that despite the sorrow and grief, tragedy “brought out the truth about how deeply Harvard students feel about their institution in a way that’s unprecedented.”
Students and faculty alike contributed to different social media outlets to present YouTube videos of dorms and welcome videos to prospective students. To replace the canceled panels, the Admissions Office also organized Google+ student panels where students discussed experiences, perspectives, and advice.
“The dedication, the creativity of the student body, and just the sheer inventiveness really, was very, very much on display,” Fitzsimmons said of student and faculty efforts to ensure that accepted students were still able to get an idea of Harvard life.
The unique circumstances of the week demonstrated that “an interesting combination of head and heart” gave prospective students “a much clearer sense of the soul of the institution,” Fitzsimmons said.
The “unscripted” and “unguarded” nature of the videos and telephone discussions was “much more from the heart, much more real than any sort of scripted video or really any kind of programmatic kind of event,” he continued.

University President Drew G. Faust signed the “Cambridge Community Compact for a Sustainable Future” on Monday in an official gesture of Harvard’s commitment to working with other public and private institutions to address the threat of climate change in Cambridge.
A Monday morning signing ceremony in MIT’s Barton Auditorium marked the end of more than a year’s work on the agreement, whose other signatories include MIT President L. Rafael Reif, Cambridge Mayor Henrietta J. Davis, and City Manager Robert W. Healy.
“We have much to gain from continuing to work together to confront climate change,” Faust said, according to the Harvard Gazette. “And I hope other leaders across the city are inspired to join us—and our partners in the private sector—in creating a healthier and more sustainable Cambridge.”
The four-page document outlines a number of steps that leaders at Harvard and MIT have already initiated to harness Cambridge’s intellectual capacity and high-tech private sector in the service of furthering local sustainability projects. For example, University representatives will sit on a number of Cambridge committees, such as the Cambridge Climate Protection Action Committee and the Green Building/Zoning Task Force. Harvard and MIT will also help to expand the Hubway bike-sharing program and create more green spaces and farmers’ markets in the city.
“The Community Compact is a living and voluntary document that will evolve over time to maximize local impact and enhance the sharing of ideas and solutions beyond Cambridge, and will be used to invite stakeholders throughout Cambridge to participate in building a better future together,” the compact states.
The agreement establishes a steering committee of representatives for each of the signatories, who will meet four times a year to coordinate projects and compile an annual progress report for the community.
Davis announced at the signing ceremony that the partnership has already garnered the support of several businesses, including Internet content delivery company Akamai Technologies, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, and Whole Foods.
Harvard spokesperson for sustainability Colin B. Durrant said that connecting the public and private sectors is a particularly important feature of the compact. A potential collaboration, for example, might partner Harvard with Akamai Technologies to develop environmentally friendly information technology services, Durrant said.

Tweeting can be a high-stakes activity for History department chair David R. Armitage. When asked to recount his most memorable Twitter experience, his response is simple: “Competitive live-tweeting a conference last semester.”
Armitage is just one of many professors who have taken to Twitter to join the growing space for academic discourse online. From publicizing their work to exchanging ideas with colleagues, faculty members at Harvard are trying to keep up with the new landscape of social media.
“[Twitter] is like having a private army of people that are collecting information that might be relevant to you,” says sociology professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis, who signed up for a Twitter account after many of his colleagues had already started using the platform.
While most students and younger Twitter users utilize the platform as a way of posting small jokes or lighthearted material, professors generally use Twitter to share and receive knowledge.
When asked about their fondest Twitter moment, most professors recall a new or interesting piece of information they learned through a retweet or tweeting at a conference.
“I originally went on Twitter just as a way to send the word out when I published something,” says Stephen M. Walt, professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School.
Now, as more and more professors sign up for Twitter handles, the exchange of academic information has accelerated to match the rapid-fire pace of online social media. But not all faculty members are as enthusiastic as Armitage, with some cautioning that the informal and open network of the “Twittersphere” may not be the best space for scholarly discourse.
CHANGING SCHOLARLY DISCOURSE
People do not often think of Twitter as a venue for mature academic discourse. On a social platform that hosts young people broadcasting events in their everyday lives and sharing everything from personal photos to funny memes, it seems unlikely that a professor would fit in.
But the growing popularity of Twitter among faculty members shows how the new medium may actually change the way that scholars of today define their academic network.
Indeed, bringing Twitter to the academic sphere could revolutionize how information is broadcast. The platforms offers a way for scholars to share 140 characters worth of information, link to other online resources, and engage in rapid-fire discussion with other users.
“I think absolutely scholarship is changing,” said Christakis. “Twitter is a mechanism to disseminate information of scholarly interest and also to acquire information.”
But not all professors agree that Twitter is the best forum for such exchange.
“People are people. We still need time to think about things. We still benefit from talking things through with another person,” says economics professor Jeffrey A. Miron. “But it won’t change the nature of the discourse.”
Whether or not Twitter will change the academic landscape, it has already changed how many scholars access and distribute knowledge or news from a variety of sources.
“Occasionally people say to me, ‘You’re department chair, you must be incredibly busy. How do you have time to do Twitter?’ and I say how do I have time not to do it?” says Armitage. “It’s such a wonderful way to bring information to yourself. I find it absolutely indispensable.”
DOWNSIDES AND DANGERS
Professor Walt’s Twitter account is peppered with links to articles, commentary on contemporary issues, and also the colloquial “u”—shorthand for the second person.
The abbreviated language is just one of the restrictions imposed by the 140 character limit.
“A downside, an obvious one, is having to shrink everything to very brief, pithy 140 characters,” says Armitage. “Sometimes, it can be very constraining. You can’t lay out complex arguments in such a short space.”
The character limit can also prompt users to post speedy, but unfiltered, content.
“One downside is it encourages sort of snap reactions to things. We see that in response to big events like the Marathon bombings,” says Walt. “It facilitates a lot of uninformed speculation in ways that couldn’t really happen 30 years ago.”
Professors also note that posting on Twitter raises privacy concerns.
“My motto for everything I say and do is: before you say it, you should assume it’s going to be on the front page of the paper,” Miron says.
Christakis agrees. “If you really wanted private communication I think you would use email, and even that’s not private,” he says.
Additionally, Twitter provides an alternative to face-to-face interaction that could lead users to assume an entirely different—and potentially harmful—cyber-persona.
“When people think that they are talking to a machine rather than to another human, I think a lot of misery can come from that,” says Christakis. “A lot of feelings can get hurt.”
“WHERE STUPIDITY REIGNS”
Like their professors, some students think faculty forays into social media have significant academic benefits.
“I really like the idea of professors being on Twitter because I think it will allow research and thinking to be more accessible outside of the classroom,” says Cary A. Williams ’16. “It’s a really good vehicle for making what was once very private knowledge more immediately accessible.”
But not every student can relate to a faculty member’s use of the medium. While some students keep their Twitter accounts private in order to express themselves without being seen by parents or potential employers, most professors have public accounts because their main objective is to disseminate their work to as many people as possible.
“I don’t want my professors on Twitter,” says Hanna Evensen ’16, who is taking a class with a professor with a Twitter account.
Evensen explained that a professorial presence thwarts the carefree and expressive discussion that many Twitter users prefer.
“It is the one place where stupidity reigns,” she adds. “Let stupidity have its place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Gathered Tuesday for their final meeting of the semester, members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences complained that their voices are not being heard on a number of important issues affecting the University and the way it is governed.
In an hour-long discussion that touched on a variety of topics ranging from the expansion of HarvardX to development in Allston, frustrated professors questioned the consultative mechanisms currently in place and the degree to which administrators are willing to listen to the faculty.
“The common question that we all have is this: how effectively do the forums that we have available to us achieve the consultation and communication that we need?” said history professor and vice-chair of the Faculty Docket Committee Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, who initiated Tuesday's discussion.
The docketed exchange comes at the end of an academic year rife with administrative decisions that have angered faculty and left administrators, professors, and students struggling to communicate. But the unusual move to dedicate a portion of the faculty’s monthly meeting to the subject came only after news that administrators had authorized secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts—a revelation that intensified concerns about faculty-administration relations.
“I do believe that some of my colleagues, and this includes me, do feel that there may be a proliferation of members of the administration who are not members of the faculty,” history professor Alison Frank Johnson said at the meeting. “I think that may contribute to some of the alienation that some may feel—that we have a more corporate management structure than we used to.”
Faculty members said that structure, in which administrators often seem to outnumber faculty in the decision-making process, discourages their participation. Several professors noted the experience of sitting on or chairing committees whose recommendations are never really considered by administrators, while others pointed to the difficulty of substantively engaging with administrators during the highly structured faculty meetings.
“I would welcome us to consider the ways in which even consultation falls short of governance,” Johnson said.
Though the discussion was itself initiated by the Faculty Council, FAS’s only elected body, a number of professors suggested the Council is not serving its purpose as a mechanism to raise faculty concerns to deans.
But History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, a member of the Council, said the group has taken large strides in the past year to better represent the faculty as a whole. He alluded to Jasanoff’s point that the Council has helped facilitate a number of alternative discussion tools in the last semester, including town hall-style meetings and online discussion boards. If faculty members are dissatisfied with their relationship with administrators, he added, they need to do something about it.
“I think that we have to practice what we preach,” Hamburger said. “If we are concerned about communication, if we feel that no one loves us and nobody is listening, then we should take those opportunities we have to be heard.”
The conversation over Faculty Council quickly shifted to HarvardX, an initiative about which faculty said their opinions have largely been ignored. HarvardX is Harvard’s segment of EdX, an online learning platform launched by Harvard and MIT one year ago.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith disagreed, saying that faculty have been included at various points along the way. The University, he said, is actively working with professors to determine how they can best use edX to complement their work.
“The world is moving in this way, and we should be part of this conversation because we are looked at as a leader in higher education and our voice matters,” Smith said, adding that the faculty has had and will continue to have chances to offer input.
But faculty pushed back, suggesting that they should have a hand in influencing not just the EdX curriculum but also its intellectual infrastructure. Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall, who serves as chair of the Committee on General Education, said that he hears from many professors worried about the implications of EdX.
“Within [certain groups] there is widespread concern about how HarvardX is proceeding,” Hall said. “And many of my colleagues notice that meetings happen that are devoted to implementing HarvardX, but not meetings where faculty are consulted.”
History professor Charles S. Maier ’60 echoed that concern, cautioning that although online education may be the model of the future, it still merits thoughtful consideration.
“These things may be taking place in the world, but my own sense is that there is a great fast train at the station, and we’re rushing to get on without knowing where it is going,” Maier said. “We might think about which train we want to take.”
Though the governance discussion took up nearly two-thirds of the meeting, faculty did vote to approve a number of procedural proposals, including new rules in the Handbook for Students that would change the way reading and exam periods work. Beginning in 2014, Reading Period will be shortened and all final papers and projects will be due during the newly named Final Project and Examination Period.
Tuesday’s meeting was the last regularly scheduled faculty meeting of the year.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification and correction:
CLARIFICATION: May 11, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger quickly refuted the claim that the Faculty Council is not serving its purpose as a mechanism to raise faculty concerns to administrators. To clarify, Hamburger did not directly refute this claim.
CORRECTION: May 11, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Hamburger enumerated several alternative discussion tools recently facilitated by the Council. In fact, Hamburger alluded to comments made by history professor and vice-chair of the Faculty Docket Committee Maya R. Jasanoff ’96.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and members of the Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guard Union rallied outside of Widener Library on Monday to call attention to the union’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University.
Attendees interviewed at the rally said that their goal was to draw attention to the negotiations, and that they were still hopeful about reaching an agreement with the University.
“We definitely want to work together with Harvard, and that’s why we’re here,” said Aldo L. Campodonico, a guard at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum. “We just want people to know that we are here, we are a part of Harvard, and that we have our little corner, but we take care of it.”
His voice booming across Tercentenary Theatre, HUSPMGU President Daniel Meagher urged passersby to sign the union’s petition. The group, chanting “Fair pay for the 54,” then marched to Mass Hall.
Founded in 1996 after it split from the Service Employees International Union, HUSPMGU currently represents museum attendants and parking guards employed by the University. According to Meagher, the union’s workers are among the lowest-paid at the University.
Meagher said that 62 percent of the union makes less than $16 per hour, adding that he believes the wage increases proposed by the University are not enough.
“We’re not looking to become the highest-paid employees here,” Meagher said. “We’re looking just to accomplish wage and benefit equity with the other service and trade unions.”
A University spokesperson, in an email to The Crimson, affirmed the University’s commitment to negotiations but pointed out that the union’s wages are competitive already.
“Wages for HUSPMGU members are consistently at or higher than the level of wages for workers in similar positions in the local area, and we are committed to reaching an agreement that is fair and equitable to HUSPMGU members,” wrote the spokesperson.
The last contract that the union negotiated went into effect in July of 2010, and is set to expire at the end of this June. It included a minimum wage increase of three percent in the first year, followed by increases of 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent in the next two years.
The union and management of both the museum and parking guards recently implemented a training program for employees, and the extra value added by this training justifies higher wage increases, according to Meagher.
“Harvard has cultural treasure in terms of the art museums and it’s really something that the University holds and trusts for all mankind,” Meagher said. “And now the force of guards they have now are some of the best-trained guards in America.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at the Harvard Law School voted in support of a referendum calling on Harvard University to divest from fossil fuel companies, becoming the second student body after the College to vote in support of divestment.
In a five-day vote that took place last week, 67 percent of voters cast a ballot in favor of the divestment initiative, which calls on Harvard to divest from direct holdings in the top 200 public fossil fuel companies and to cease any future investment in those companies.
According to an email sent by the Student Representative Board—the student government at the Law School—the referendum drew 782 voters—approximately 40 percent of the Law School’s total enrollment.
“Frankly, the urgency and the congressional inaction when it comes to fossil fuels deserves singular, driven, concentrated action by students,” said Sean Hamidi, a second-year law student who is part of the group that is organizing the divestment push at the Law School.
Hamidi added that he was excited by the result of the referendum.
“It’s really exciting and inspiring because law students get so much flak for not caring about things or for being removed from the broader student community,” Hamidi said. “I think that the referendum went a long way in demonstrating that Harvard law students recognize how important global warming is.”
Hamidi, along with several peers, started the referendum process in mid-April when they gathered over 250 signatures to present to the SRB. The SRB and the divestment group then presented the finalized referendum question to the general student body on April 22, which Hamidi said was chosen because it was Earth Day.
According to the same email from the SRB to law school students, the SRB will be sending a letter to University President Drew G. Faust and the Law School administration “encouraging them to work with the student leaders to effect this change.”
While Hamidi was happy with the success of the referendum, he said that he recognized that it was only the first step in what will be a longer fight to get the University to divest.
“Our goal for the summer is to plan, organize, and build power, because in the fall, we’re going to come back stronger, and we’re going to push for more direct action calling on the University to divest from fossil fuels,” Hamidi said. “We’re really looking to work with other schools at the University to build the movement and to apply pressure on the administration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ inaugural Harvard Horizons initiative—a program designed to highlight some of the best work of Harvard Ph.D. students­­—culminated in a TED Talk-style symposium on Monday.
The event, which took place in Sanders Theater, consisted of a series of five-minute lectures during which the eight Horizon scholars presented their work and ideas. The students’ talks spanned a variety of topics, including applied physics, music, psychology, and English.
The eight scholars were selected from 55 applicants at the end of March and attended weekly workshops where experts coached them on communication skills such as voice, presence, and the use of visual aids.
Shigehisa Kuriyama, Chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, said the symposium presented snapshots of “the most interesting and cutting-edge research projects going on around campus” in just one hour.
“Looking at the intellectual return compared to the time investment, [it is] one of the richest events of the year,” said Kuriyama, who proposed the initiative in collaboration with GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng.
The eight students will form the first class of the Society of Horizon Scholars, a fellowship that seeks to “offer opportunities for community, mentorship, and professional growth,” according to the Harvard Horizons website.
Through the fellowship, previous scholars will be encouraged to communicate with new ones, said Visual and Environmental studies professor Laura A. Frahm, who co-directs the mentorship aspect of the program.
“We really want to gain an ongoing process and dialogue with [the scholars],” Frahm said.
According to Meng, Harvard Horizons began as an idea to create a platform for students to talk to each other across different disciplines and across different schools, but soon grew to showcase research achievements and offer mentoring and professional development resources for its scholars.
Kuriyama and Meng agreed that the program is important because graduate students often do not have the opportunities that undergraduate students or outside researchers have to showcase their work.
“Harvard has extremely talented students—we need to provide them with a venue,” Meng said.
Meng also said that because of large graduate student interest in the program, the team is considering scaling it up in the future, possibly through a J-Term program.
Graduate student Hansun Hsiung, who explored the history of the textbook and the rise of distance learning, said the program offered him the dual opportunity to understand academia and to improve his own communication skills.
Hsiung and other scholars also cited the opportunity to interact with and learn from each other.
“I’ve been really focused on my research—it was really great to hear what else has been happening on campus,” said Ph.D. candidate Alexander L. Fattal, whose research deals with the demobilization of FARC rebels in Colombia.
Stephanie Dick, a Ph.D. candidate in the History of Science department who covered the history of mathematics and computing, emphasized the community-building element of the program.
“We have truly bonded as colleagues and have become invested in each other’s work in a way that is still uncommon across disciplines,” she said in her closing remarks at the symposium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a three-part series on gender disparity issues at the Law School. Part I ran on May 6, and Part III ran on May 10.
Among the top students in their graduating classes, men and women entering Harvard Law School earn similar undergraduate grades and LSAT scores. But as soon as students step into Wasserstein Hall, a dramatic gender disparity emerges.
Indicators suggest that female students participate less and perform worse than their male counterparts over the course of their three years at the Law School.
“For better or worse, when women come to law school, they feel their gender more strongly than they may have in undergrad,” said third-year law student Stephanie E. Davidson, outgoing president of the Women’s Law Association. “I still barely have words to describe why that is or what that means. But you feel like a female lawyer instead of a lawyer.”
Davidson is not alone. Hundreds of students and faculty gathered this spring for Shatter the Ceiling, a new coalition whose goal is to address gender disparities at Harvard Law. The issue of imbalance in the classroom has emerged at the forefront of their discussions, prompting reactions across the campus and the nation over how women and men stack up.
IS SOCRATES SEXIST?
Harvard Law student Jessica R. Jensen hates the Socratic method. “It’s the worst thing in the world,” she said. “It forces you to talk like a man.”
“It made me feel really uncomfortable and incompetent at first, and it really impacted my performance in classes the first year,” Jensen said. “You feel like you don’t know the material really well because you feel like an idiot in class.”
Employed in some form across most classrooms at Harvard Law School, the Socratic method, a teaching style that relies on cold-calling, lies at the heart of the debate over gender issues and serves as a focal point for the Shatter coalition.
Today, many students and faculty have raised concerns over the teaching method, saying that men are more likely to participate voluntarily in Law School classes than women.
In a 2004 study on gender issues at Harvard Law School, a then-third-year law student Adam M. C. Neufeld found that men were 50 percent more likely than women to volunteer at least one comment during class, and 144 percent more likely to speak voluntarily at least three times. The study also showed that 10 percent of students accounted for nearly half of all volunteered comments in first-year law classrooms.
“I think the big point is that many men weren’t talking too,” Neufeld said. “There was a small number of people who account for most of the comments.”
More recently, according to a 2012 study at Yale Law School, men made 58 percent of comments in the classroom, while women made 42 percent.
Yet the root cause of this disparity remains contested, as professors, students, and administrators debate whether the Socratic method—the traditional form of legal pedagogy—needs to be adapted to account for gender disparities in the classroom.
For many in the Law School, the Socratic method is an outdated teaching style that reinforces gender imbalances in academia.
“Women take longer to process thoughts before they feel comfortable to say them out loud than men do,” Jensen said, adding that men feel more natural in that kind of classroom atmosphere.
Because of this disparity, the Shatter coalition hopes to encourage changes to the Law School pedagogy.
“If you can show that the Socratic method makes us better lawyers, then fine, but we need to see that data,” said Lena M. Silver, a third-year Law School student and the co-chair of the Shatter the Ceiling coalition.
Harvard Law professor Lani C. Guinier ’71, who has authored several articles on legal pedagogy, said that the problems described by Silver and her group highlight potential issues with legal education today.
“In short, women’s reaction to law school is an important warning sign, but a warning sign that the problem will not go away simply by focusing on helping the women think more like their male counterparts,” Guinier wrote in an email, saying that the faculty should reevaluate their pedagogical techniques.
Others suggested that the pressures of the classroom environment contribute to women not raising their hands as often as men. “Women are more likely to be called ‘gunners’ or ‘teacher’s pets’ if they participate in class,” said Jean N. Ripley, second-year Law School student and co-chair of the Shatter coalition.
In his study, Neufeld, who said he supports the Socratic method, found that women assessed themselves significantly lower than men did, suggesting that different confidence levels may account for the disparity in classroom participation.
“Volunteering is a fairly socially aggressive act,” he said. “You are making all the other students listen to your comment, you think it is unbelievably important and something that no one else has thought of.”
Yet supporters of the Socratic method discount the existence of inherent gender disparities and argue that it is an essential part of the legal education.
“It’s an extreme form of sexism to say that essentially women in general aren’t capable of dealing with the demands of the Socratic method,” said Harvard Law professor Alan M. Dershowitz.
Dershowitz noted that some of the best Socratic students in his classes have been women. “You cannot generalize about men and women when it comes to their ability to be law students or practice law,” he said. “We have to keep inquiring as to why this disparity exists but we have to do it without divulging into stereotypes.”
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow pointed to an ongoing debate over the possibility of gendered dimensions of certain forms of argument and reasoning, saying that it “can’t be the case” that “certain types of reasoning are beyond the reach of a group of students.”
And many professors, including Dershowitz, defend the Socratic method as a critical component of the Harvard Law School education.
“The whole practice of law is Socratic,” he said. “You can’t be an effective advocate without mastering the Socratic method.”
Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk, who graduated from the Law School in 2002, said she agrees that this pedagogy is critical to teaching students how to think.
“I love to see students grow more comfortable as I did and see how fun it is,” she said. “I believe a hard push from a trusted teacher is necessary.”
Supporters of the technique also argue that the Socratic method in its purest form, with no voluntary participation component, elicits an equal number of comments from men and women. Minow, who has held workshops on different pedagogical techniques to ensure faculty reach every student, recommends cold-calling as a teaching technique to balance participation.
“It turns out that many of the women who would think they would not have something to contribute find out that they do very well,” Minow said.
Although Harvard Law professors do still incorporate opportunities for voluntary response into their courses, some are relying more often on cold-calling to keep their students talkative.
Harvard Law professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said that he consciously calls on more women than men “just to move closer to gender balance.”
Suk said uses a similar strategy in her first-year criminal law class. “I find that the more students are called upon to speak the more likely they are to volunteer,” she said.
Overall, there is no right way to teach, according to Harvard Law Professor Gabriella Blum. Blum said she encourages students “to expose themselves to different professors and teaching styles so as to enrich their experience,” she wrote in an e-mail.
THINKING LIKE A LAWYER
Early in his teaching career, one of Dershowitz’s star students approached him with an essay she submitted for another class. In other classes, she had received an A from not only Dershowitz, but also several other first-year teachers—yet she had received a D on her latest exam. After reading what he considered to be a stellar piece of academic writing, Dershowitz asked the student’s professor if an error had been made.
“He said, ‘I didn’t make a mistake, she just didn’t think like a lawyer,’” Dershowitz repeated. “It was clear he had been biased by her gender.”
This exchange prompted Dershowitz to push for anonymous grading at Harvard Law, a policy change that resulted in a dramatic increase in women’s grades.
“But they’re still not high enough,” Dershowitz said.
Though Minow has refused to release data on the gender breakdown of grades, professors said that indicators point to a dramatic disparity between men’s and women’s performance despite blind assessment.
Neufeld’s 2004 study found that women earned lower grades in first-year courses across three years of data, though the disparity varied in part with the content and gender of the professor. The form of assessment, by contrast, did not increase or decrease the grade disparity.
In the study, men were also more likely to receive graduation honors than women, a disparity frequently cited by the Shatter coalition.
“We haven’t created a situation in which women are doing as well as we’d like them to be,” Law school professor Christine Desan said. “Part of that is surely societal, both social and political.”
But the gender grade disparity is not the same at other law schools, according to visiting professor Laura Rosenbury.
“It’s interesting because I’ve been teaching at Washington University in St. Louis, and we don’t have this problem,” said Rosenbury in a video released by the Shatter coalition. “In fact, women outperform their male colleagues both in terms of grades and in terms of law review competition. And so what makes Harvard different?”
Faculty and students alike have struggled to find an answer.
Minow said there is “unequivocally” no difference in undergraduate grades or the LSAT scores of men and women coming into Harvard Law.
“They are at some level puzzling, because the grading in the big classes are completely anonymous,” Tushnet said. “And yet there must be something about the style of a writing or arguing that the faculty prefers that tilts in favor of men.”
Others said they believe that levels of confidence and self-perception may play a role.
“The main argument for this one is the stereotype threat,” Neufeld said. “If you are a high school girl who’s taking a math class, and there’s a general perception that women do worse, you, no matter what your inherent ability, are going to be more anxious because you don’t want to do poorly and reflect that stereotype, and you will end up doing worse because you can’t relax and focus.”
While the cause of these issues remains unknown, in many ways the extent of the problem is also uncertain.
No new grade data has been released since the administration changed the grading system from the standard letter grades to an honors, pass/fail system. A key goal of the Shatter coalition has been access to that data, but Minow has declined to share it.
“We don’t need to have a study, we need to work on making this better,” Minow said. “Do I think there are issues about whether or not Harvard Law School or any law school is conducive to learning for any student? Yes. Might there be gendered dimensions? Possibly. You don’t have to prove anything to me; I’m already committed to addressing these issues, as is the faculty.”
Desan said that as long as she and her colleagues continue to grade, they must take responsibility for the marks they give.
“If those grades suggest that there may be a problem with our teaching or our testing, then we should try to figure out what that problem is,” she said. “We have data that we haven’t explored yet, and I think it’s time that we explored it.”
While Minow said she hopes to diminish the role of grades in the community, some students have raised concerns that beyond the Harvard Law campus, grades remain critical to success.
“I think that potentially a barrier Dean Minow has to face in deemphasizing the prestige of those things is that the legal profession and the academic world still values them,” President of the Student Representative Board Lisa M. Lana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seeking a spot in the team racing national regatta in Florida later this month, the Harvard co-ed sailing team raced for the Fowle Trophy this weekend.
The regatta served as the team racing regional qualifier for New England, and of the twelve teams racing, four would qualify for a spot in Florida. With Harvard hosting the regatta, despite the squad’s lack of experience with team racing, hopes were high that the Crimson would have been able to exploit home field advantage in some capacity.
However, these hopes were shot as Harvard crashed out in the first round. It finished fifth in its division of six teams, narrowly missing out on one of the top four spots that went through to the next round of competition.
“It was our last chance to qualify for any of the three [different types of national championships] in the spring,” Harvard coach Mike O’Connor said. “It’s the first time we haven’t done that in a while, so I’m pretty disappointed.”
Harvard showed early signs of promise as early on it beat the eventual champion Brown squad, which was otherwise undefeated in the opening round.
A win over hapless Boston University, which failed to record a single win, coupled with losses to Boston College and Connecticut College set up a crucial encounter with Dartmouth.
Defeating the Big Green would have seen Harvard advance, but a slow start derailed the team’s plans.
“We were losing off the line pretty badly,” sophomore skipper Gram Slattery said. “Then we just weren’t able to pass them. It was a case of a very bad start.”
The defeat consigned Harvard to a 2-3 record, tied with Dartmouth for fourth place. But the Big Green held the tiebreaker on account of the head-to-head win and advanced to the next stage.
“It wasn’t our day,” Slattery said. “Everyone was a little off their A-game.”
For the Crimson, it was a case of missed opportunities and errors adding up which cost the squad. The team was extremely competitive in all of its races. As shown in the win over Brown, there is talent on the roster and on another day it could have been a very different story.
“Almost every race we sailed in, at one point we were in,” O’Connor said. “We [often] had a chance to solidify a convoy, and sometimes we were able to do it, other times we weren’t. Sometimes we could convert but couldn’t hold on.”
Lack of experience with team racing played a role in Harvard’s weekend. The team was skippered by a trio of sophomores, and the crew members consisted of two juniors and a freshman.
“It’s rare to start three sophomores in a conference championship, especially in team racing,” O’Connor said. “There was no question that that was a factor in the performance.”
The Crimson has traditionally been more focused on fleet racing. Only after failing to qualify for nationals in that discipline two weeks ago has Harvard’s training been concentrated on team racing. For sophomores with only limited time spent as team racers, the level of competition proved a difficult challenge.
“Against that level of competition, you can’t make mistakes because once you make it, the other team will act on it [and] solidify it,” O’Connor said. “There’s not much you can do unless you can outhandle them, and we’re just still too young to be able to not mistakes and comeback against a very good team.”
With the season now over, Harvard is now looking forward to next season. While inexperience may have cost the squad this season, no starters are graduating this year.
“I actually think we’re in a very good position for next season,” Slattery said. “Once we have more experience, we will definitely have a good chance of making team race nationals.”
Outside of team racing, it may have been a disappointing season for Harvard sailing, but next year brings with it some serious promise. The sophomore trio of Slattery and brothers Brian and Michael Drumm have the potential to develop into a dominant leading corps, while co-captain Isabel Ruane and classmate Sarah Pierson will also return.
“I think the experience these guys got this year has been valuable,” O’Connor said.” I would have liked them to have got some more experience, particularly sailing in the nationals, but we’re excited about the work these kids are doing. They’ll continue to work hard and we’re going to get in a couple more good players next year, so we’re pretty excited about next season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 2:51 remaining in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s third-round NCAA tournament matchup with the University of Arizona, senior Christian Webster launched a three-pointer from the right wing.
The shot clanged off the front of the rim. It didn’t matter—at least, not for the outcome of the game. The Crimson was trailing by 21. But the shot mattered to Webster.
Before he pulled up from that spot on the right wing, Webster had taken 796 shots in a Harvard uniform. Some of those shots had helped the Crimson earn its first Ivy League title back in 2011, some had helped the Crimson reach the NCAA tournament in 2012, and some had helped the Crimson win its first postseason game in 2013. But shot No. 797 mattered only because it was Webster’s last—not just the last of his Harvard career, but also, maybe, the last of his basketball career.
***
Since the fall of 2009—when Webster arrived in Cambridge as a member of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s second recruiting class—only three Harvard players have scored 1,000 career points: Jeremy Lin ’10, Keith Wright ’12, and, now, Webster.
Like Lin and Wright before him, Webster met with Amaker after his final game to plan his future. Lin, currently with the Houston Rockets, and Wright, currently with a professional club in Sweden, had told Amaker they wanted to extend their playing careers professionally.
But when Webster met with Amaker, the senior had a different attitude.
“The one thing I told him was that—with how well the season went this year and everything that we’ve accomplished and I’ve accomplished—I feel like I can be at peace with my basketball career,” Webster said.
In the weeks since the Crimson bowed out of the NCAA tournament, life has been different for Webster. The buzz surrounding the Crimson’s victory over the third-seeded University of New Mexico has died down. Fewer and fewer strangers are stopping him on the street. When his former teammates walk across the river to lift at Palmer Dixon, Webster stays on the Cambridge side of campus.
“It’s definitely really weird being without basketball in the springtime,” Webster said. “All the guys are heading down to their lifts and their workouts. I think it really hit me when they went to go work out and I didn’t. It was tough to deal with.”
But while Webster is transitioning out of one role, he seems to be fitting into another quite nicely.
***
“You look at that picture,” Webster said, referring to a team photo from his days playing in a Washington D.C. pee-wee league as a seven-year old, “and I’m the only one that I think is about to graduate from college right now.”
One of Webster’s former teammates in the picture was murdered. Another is in jail. The rest, Webster said, all dropped out before completing a degree.
That’s a fate Webster is now trying to help others avoid.
Since Harvard’s season came to a close, Webster has begun traveling to Boston-area schools, speaking about the importance of education.
“I’ve always been interested in education, and I love being around kids.” Webster said. “Education can open so many doors. It opened so many doors for me.”
As a kid growing up in Washington, D.C., Webster never imagined he would end up at Harvard. Until he was 14, Webster attended Deal Junior High School in the city.
He was planning on enrolling at a private school in D.C. until a family friend showed him the Landon School, in Bethesda, Md.
Webster applied, and soon he was traveling nearly an hour each morning from his home in D.C. to the small prep school.
“At first I was like ‘I cannot be here, I don’t know any of these people, they’re not from where I’m from,’” Webster recalled. “They were talking about things I didn’t even know about.”
But Webster’s parents, a social worker and an accountant, insisted he stay at the school, and soon enough he adjusted to his new environment.
“My parents were like, ‘You need to stay here; this is going to be good for you,’” Webster recalled. “I listened to them, so now I’m at Harvard. It all paid off.”
Webster hopes his story can serve as an inspiration.
“I feel like with my background in basketball I feel like I can maybe touch a kid or two and hopefully change their lives,” Webster said.
***
This summer, Webster will travel to Cuba with Full Court Peace, an organization founded by former Harvard basketball graduate assistant Mike Evans.
Along with seven other Americans, Webster and Evans will build a court in Alamar, Cuba, over the course of six days.
While playing professional basketball in Northern Ireland in 2007, Evans founded the organization with the goal of  “unit[ing], strengthen[ing] and educat[ing] local and global communities through the creation of youth basketball teams.”
Since then, Evans and his organization have regularly worked in Juarez, Mexico, Bridgeport, Conn., and—for the past four summers—Cuba.
“We’re so not political, and we just don’t care about all of the stuff associated with Cuba. We just go down to play basketball and to meet people. And there couldn’t be anyone better than Christian,” Evans said. “He’s always there for other people. It’s never about him.”
The annual trip concludes with a tournament between the Americans and Cuban teams. Despite bringing Division I talent with him each year, Evans and the Americans have yet to win a championship.
This summer, though, with Webster serving as the focal point of the offense, Evans believes that will change.
Webster was surprised to learn of Evans’ high expectations.
“I guess I got to start working out again,” he said.
After all that, it looks like shot No. 797 might not be Webster’s last after all. He’s got one more game left.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last season’s Outdoor Heptagonal Championships, senior Mary Hirst etched her name in the Harvard track and field record books with the second best heptathlon performance in school history. Despite the record-breaking outing, Hirst finished in second place in the event, falling to Dartmouth’s Janae Dunchack by a narrow margin.
In February of this year, Hirst found herself in second place to Dunchack once again, this time in the pentathlon at Indoor Heps.
After back-to-back runner-up finishes, last weekend’s Outdoor Heps was the senior’s last chance at an Ancient Eight championship. And if her performances in the heptathlon and high jump are any indication, she wasn’t leaving anything to chance.
Hirst scored 5359 points to shatter the school record in the heptathlon and went on to have a personal-best clearance in the high jump. She had failed to capture an Ivy championship for four years as of Sunday morning, but on Sunday evening, she had two.
“I was nailing every event,” Hirst said. “It’s just amazing to finally have won it after all this time of wanting to win it.”
Everything seemingly fell into place for the senior, as she had personal-best marks in six of the heptathlon’s seven events over the weekend.
“Usually you’ll have some down events, some events that don’t go so well,” said Harvard assistant coach Kebba Tolbert, who works with the squad’s multi-event athletes. “It’s rare to have six of seven events be your [personal record] unless you’re on fire, which she was.”
Hirst won each of the four field components of the heptathlon: the shot put, long jump, javelin throw, and high jump. Before she stepped in the throwing ring for the shot put, her father, who made the trip to Princeton for the meet, jokingly told her to throw 13 meters. In practice leading up to the meet, she was hitting marks just over 12 meters.
Much to her surprise, Hirst hit a mark of exactly 13.00 meters on her second attempt, almost a full meter farther than Dunchack, her nearest competitor. Still, Dunchack remained close to Hirst in the standings until the javelin throw, the heptathlon’s sixth event. With a throw of 40.29 meters, Hirst earned some separation from her rival, who recorded a 23.36-meter mark.
“I was constantly wanting to get scores that were beating [Dunchack] so I could win it in the end,” Hirst said. “My coach didn’t want to tell me my score because he wanted me to run a great 800. So I just knew, ‘Well, I think I’m ahead, but I’m not sure, so I just have to run my heart out and beat her.’”
When the senior crossed the finish line with a three-second personal record in the 800, edging out Dunchack by just over a second, she knew that he had locked up the title.
“I couldn’t walk two feet without having one of my teammates come up to me and give me a hug and tell me how great I’d done,” Hirst said.
Although she had just turned in the fourth best heptathlon performance in Ivy League history and the 18th in the country this season, the senior’s day wasn’t over when she crossed the finish line in the 800 meter run.
Roughly 45 minutes later, Hirst competed in the high jump. She and Cornell’s Ailish Hanly were the only two jumpers remaining when the bar was raised to 1.78 meters. After Hanly cleared the bar on her first attempt and Hirst did not, it appeared that Hirst was destined for yet another second-place finish.
However, Hirst cleared the bar on her second attempt and went on to clear it again when it was raised to 1.80 meters, her personal-best clearance and the third best in school history. Hanly was unable to match the jump, and Hirst earned her second victory of the day.
“She’s grown a lot in the past year,” Tolbert said. “She’s matured a lot, and she knows what it takes to reach this level of performance. She’s put in the time, energy, and effort to be an elite Ivy League athlete.”
With her pair of championship performances, Hirst picked up 20 points for the Crimson women’s squad, which finished in third place behind Cornell and Columbia. She was recognized as the meet’s most outstanding field athlete.
“I’ve really worked hard this year to train hard, sleep well, eat well and to really give it my all to track, so it was just amazing for it to pay off so big.”

With the recent announcement that Soledad M. O'Brien '88-'00 is slated to take the stage at Class Day this year, we at the Flyby thought we'd seize this opportunity to reflect upon some words of wisdom from previous Class Day speakers.
Here are some salient snippets of their stirring speeches. Added bonus: watching these will help you procrastinate on that paper, guaranteed.
 
2011: Amy Poehler
"Continue to share your heart with people even if it's been broken. Don't treat your heart like an action figure wrapped in plastic and never used. And don't try to give me that nerd argument that your heart is a batman with a limited edition silver battering and therefore if it stays in its original package it increases in value. Watch it, Harvard, you're not better than me."
Attention nerds: the time has come to unwrap your hearts and tuck them into your pocket protectors (for easy access). 
 
2007: William Jefferson Clinton
"This is a really fascinating time to be a college senior. I was looking at all of you, wishing I could start over again and thinking I'd let you be president if you let me be 21."
You mean trade youth for the single most wrinkle-inducing job in the country? Let us get back to you on that.
 
2006: Seth MacFarlane
"…Others will be doing missionary work in Africa. But remember, some of you, that Wall Street is still an option. Don't rule it out, because it is a noble profession. Goldman Sachs needs people too."
Again, before you heed this speaker's advice, be warned: this is a job for people who want wrinkles and dark circles.
 
2004: Sacha Baron Cohen ("Ali G")
"I iz also well clever—me was so brainy dat me finished me education 6 years before any of u—at de age of 15—even da teachers admitted dat dere was nothing else dat dem could teach me."
True dat, bro.
 
2000: Conan C. O'Brien '85
"Everyone out there is going to hate you. Never tell anyone in a roadside diner that you went to Harvard. In those situations, the correct response to, 'Where did you go to school?' is 'School? I never had much in the way of book learnin' and such.' And then get in your BMW and get the hell out of there. Go."
Peel that bumper sticker off your ride, box up your sweatshirts from the Coop, and save your Harvard umbrella for a really, really rainy day.

This Wednesday, two men partook in a true test of heart and stomach when they set out to consume thirteen Chickwiches in all thirteen dining halls over the course of one lunch period.
William H. Marks '12-'13, an inactive Crimson business editor, and C. M. Trey Grayson '94, director of the Institute of Politics, attempted what has been deemed the "Chickwich Challenge" to raise money for the Phillip Brooks House Association.
When we caught up with the duo in the Eliot House dining hall, they were just biting into their sixth Chickwich of the hour, which began in Annenberg and would end in Pforzheimer.
"Because we have a gap between each House, we have just enough time to get full," Marks said. "We may not make it to the Quad." In order to save their appetite, the men decided that buns were optional. The two decided ahead of time that they would not be allowed to use non-Harvard transportation in order to get from one House to another.
The Challenge was advertised over email in order to get Harvard-affiliated sponsors for the Challenge, who often donated a dollar per Chickwich eaten. Grayson even live-Tweeted his sandwich status when he had eaten his fifth in Kirkland.
"This is a gastronomical feat we will surpass," said Marks.
While Grayson said that, "Even in failure, we still succeed by raising money for PBHA," the two did in fact complete the Challenge.
When asked whether or not he had eaten all 13 Chickwiches, Marks replied, "It may be one of my least proud accomplishments but sadly, yes."
