After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Wintersession, Harvard students have the opportunity to experience a dose of Hollywood and the Boston art scene with the January Arts and Media Seminars (JAMS) program. The Harvard Arts Resource Council and the Office for the Arts at Harvard (OFA) have invited several notable alumni to work with Harvard undergraduates who are interested in pursuing careers in media and arts management from January 13 to January 22. The seminars include “Writing for Television,” with Carlton Cuse ’81 and Monica Henderson Beletsky ’99, “The Buck Stops Here: Perspectives on Careers in Arts Management,” with Connie Chin ’79, Lesley Koenig ’78, and James Torres ’83, “From Creation to Curation,” with Jen Mergel ’98, “Comedy: The Career,” with Andy Borowitz ’80, and “Scoring for Feature Films: An Overview,” with Robert M. Kraft ’76.
JAMS will provide a way for students to learn from alumni who have careers in fields that are not traditionally emphasized in Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum. “I think the chance to deal with a really terrific group of alumni will give students an opportunity to crack open the art world and imagine life in that world, and learn something about how to lead an accomplished life,” says Jack Megan, Director of the OFA.
Because they are conducted by contemporary, renowned practitioners, the seminars will give insight into the specific opportunities and challenges of occupations in art management and media today. For example, the “Writing for Television” seminar will be taught by Cuse, who wrote for the television series “LOST,” and Beletsky, who wrote and co-produced “Parenthood” and “Friday Night Lights.” “The course will teach students what it takes to be a successful published writer, as well as teach about narrative writing. I hope to provide some sort of basic tools of instruction to successfully navigate the world of TV writing,” says Cuse.
JAMS not only allows students to consider concrete examples of life in an art-related job, but also give the alumni a chance to impart the wisdom in all aspects of their professional lives. “I’ve been involved in many aspects, from performing standup to writing/producing TV and movie comedies to creating an online satire site, so I’m open to questions about all of this stuff,” says Borowitz, who is a humorist, New York Times bestselling author, and creator of the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” and “The Borowitz Report.”
According to Megan, the alumni are thrilled to meet with undergraduates; he says it is a great opportunity for them to come back and connect with the Harvard community. “I am proud to return to Harvard to speak,” says Koenig, General Director of Opera Boston.
Kraft, the President of 20th Century Fox Music, exemplifies Megan’s sentiment. “It’s wonderful not only to return to Cambridge but also to experience the excitement of the undergraduates about the things that we have done professionally,” he says. “We feel that exposing students to the arts in a commercial setting is a valuable experience because students who want to pursue artistic careers need to understand what they’re going to face when they take their [art] from a college setting and apply it to the real world.”
Through their seminars the alumni want to motivate students to find enjoyment in whatever path they follow, especially in the arts. “If you love comedy, try to make it your life’s work. It’s always a good idea to follow your bliss,” says Borowitz. Similarly, Koening advises, “[In] these bleak economic times, [a life in the arts] can easily be an all- or-nothing choice. So follow your heart, not the bucks.”
For many of the alumni, passing on their own experience is a way to spark the interests in their students that they developed in their own Harvard undergradute experience. “Many of them feel that Harvard gave them opportunities that allowed them to be successful, and they want to give back to the students,” says Megan. Megan hopes that “the alumni’s direct engagement with students will not only be personally rewarding, but cause them to think about ways that they can help Harvard—whether it be other kinds of engagements, raising funds for the arts, or introducing other artists to the Harvard community.”
According to the OFA, as of a week ago the JAMS program enrollment was up to 60 people—and the numbers are growing. Megan hopes that the program will connect students and alumni in fields that both groups are passionate about: “my hope is that both students and the guest faculty walk out of the room feeling like they were jamming.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the most fascinating aspects of chamber music is the ability of classical musicians to weave together the sound of “one person,” performing two or three parts. For Swiss chamber musicians Ambra and Fiona Albek share more in common than most members of a chamber group—they are identical twins..
Last Monday, the Albek twins played a concert in the Edward M. Pickman Concert Hall at the Longy School of Music. Violonist and violist Ambra and pianist Fiona—who hail from the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland—came to Boston as the last stop on their first tour of the United States. They performed pieces written by, among others, Béla Bartók, Joaquín Turina,
Richard Rodney Bennett, Leos Janacek, and Harvard’s own William P. Perry ’51., among others.
The twins opened their concert with selections from Turina’s “El poema de una Sanluqueña.” Before they began the piece, Ambra addressed the audience: “For this piece, we imagine ourselves in the south of Spain,” she said, with a lilting but easily understood Italian accent.
This sort of audience interaction characterized the entire night. Before each piece, Ambra and Fiona would give brief but enlightening details about the piece—why it was written, why they had chosen it, or how they were going to play it.
More striking than their interaction with the audience, though, was their interaction with each other. It is natural, of course, for skilled chamber musicians to have a strong connection with each other onstage. But the Albek twins have a connection built on decades, rather than months or years, of familiarity with each other. “We just notice that when we play together, we don’t need to say, ‘here we do a forte, here a piano’—we just feel these things at the same time,” said Ambra.
This connection was evident from the very beginning of Fiona and Ambra’s rendition of the Turina selection. The sisters played off each other’s energy, rising and falling perfectly together—not just in the sound they produced, but in the way they performed as well. When Ambra leaned into her violin more, Fiona put more weight into the piano. Each time Fiona smiled, it seemed Ambra would be smiling too.
The second piece the twins performed, entitled “The Nightingale in the Park,” was written especially for them by Perry. The  piece describes the world as viewed through a nightingale’s eyes in a park in Dublin. According to Perry, the piece was inspired in part by his background in scoring silent films. “I like to write programmatically,” Perry said. “Rather than simply say, ‘This piece is in sonata form, or rondo form, and here’s the second subject,’ and all of that—I like to visualize something happening.” The piece ends peacefully, with Ambra playing at the very highest end of the violin’s register as the bird flies to the top branch of a tree.
This piece stood in marked contrast to their third piece, “Sonata for Violin and Piano” by Czech composer Leos Janacek. Inspired by World War I, Janacek was a composer who was “desperate in his music,” Ambra said at the beginning of the performance. This desperation came through in Ambra’s insistent pizzicato and Fiona’s roiling arpeggios. “The piece is a little bit modern, but extreme,” said Fiona, emphasizing the last word. “We like that.”
In the Bennett piece, the waltz from “Murder on the Orient Express,” the ebullient twins even called for audience participation—they had a girl in the front row blow a train whistle whenever Ambra gestured toward her.
For the penultimate piece by Bartók, Ambra switched to viola, transitioning seamlessly without a loss of energy or technical proficiency.
The last piece they performed was, appropriately, both written and arranged by Italians. A reduction by Alessandro Lucchetti of Giacomo Puccini’s opera “Tosca,” the piece’s sweeping lyrical lines and dulcet harmonies captured an operatic spirit that closed the evening’s works with verve.
With a final encore of the Russian folk tune “Dark Eyes,” it was evident that the twins thoroughly enjoyed playing for American audiences. “We like the people [in America],” said Fiona. “They’re less complicated—this is a very big compliment! They’re more relaxed.”

Almost 50 years after her death by prescription drug overdose in 1962, Marilyn Monroe remains one of the most recognizable film stars of all time. Yet much of her personal life is shrouded in mystery. “My Week with Marilyn,” an upcoming film based on the published memoirs of Colin Clark, capitalizes on the ongoing fascination with this iconic personality. Simon Curtis’s movie offers a compelling account of the starlet’s life off-camera, complete with standout performances by Michelle Williams as Monroe and Eddie Redmayne as Clark.
In the film, Clark’s (Eddie Redmayne) story begins with him running away from home in 1956 as a young Oxford graduate, hoping to pursue a career in motion pictures. He becomes an assistant on the set of “The Prince and the Showgirl,” a comedy that cast Monroe (Michelle Williams) alongside celebrated British stage actor Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). Monroe filmed the movie in Britain while on honeymoon with her third husband, American playwright Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott). But when Miller leaves to concentrate on his writing, Monroe behaves erratically, misses work, and abuses sedatives. She seeks emotional support and an escape from the pressures of fame in the open arms of the naive Clark—and thus the titular “week with Marilyn” begins.
Filling the stilettos of such a well-known persona is no easy task, and Williams’s adept portrayal of Monroe reflects her maturity as an actress. She is equally convincing as a sexy showgirl and an overwhelmed and insecure starlet. But while Williams’s performance lends the film glamour and gravitas, the character of Colin Clark, played by Eddie Redmayne, is just as much a star. Redmayne—a 2010 Tony Award winner whose previous work includes “The Other Boleyn Girl” and “The Yellow Handkerchief”—is winningly sympathetic as a man on the cusp of adulthood who is trying to prove that he is more than his aristocratic upbringing.
Director Simon Curtis—best known for the 2007 TV miniseries “Five Days” and a 1999 TV movie adaptation of “David Copperfield”—crafts a film that is both idyllic and surreal, sometimes overly sentimental, and other times witty and elegant. The movie delightfully tempts audiences with its tantalizing glimpses of the hidden world of 1950s cinema. Characters glide between smoke-filled drawing rooms, crowded sets, and English country homes, before a backdrop of jazz and period costumes. The star-studded cast includes Judi Dench as actress Sybil Thorndike and Emma Watson as Clark’s love interest from the wardrobe department, though both roles are unfortunately brief and unremarkable.
“My Week with Marilyn” caters to the public’s inextinguishable curiosity about celebrities. It portrays major names in cinema brought to their knees by their private demons—age, jealousy, fear. Monroe, teetering between sanity and breakdown, cannot shake the idea that she has been cast for her looks rather than her talent. Olivier struggles to reconcile Monroe’s unconventional acting methods with his traditional ideas about theatre. His wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Osmond) was once an actress herself and now dreads her imminent old age. The movie constantly reminds us that there is never enough time—a message driven home by the film’s very premise and the all-too-brief week Clark and Monroe have to spend together touring the English countryside.
Despite its drama, the film seems sanitized. There is only cursory mention of Monroe’s difficult childhood, and not even a hint toward her upcoming early death. Nonetheless, the movie will appeal to lovers of cinema’s golden age and fans of Monroe herself. Like the film industry that charmed Colin Clark, “My Week with Marilyn” is appealing, exciting, and altogether enrapturing.

An unnervingly silent teenager captivates Japan with her mystical literary debut. Two long-separated lovers hurtle towards each other through the discontinuity of time and space. A second moon appears in the sky. Nothing is as it seems in “1Q84,” Haruki Murakami’s 2009 genre-bending novel. Released in English this October, this metaphysical saga explores identity, power, and truth through the lens of an altered past.
Part mystery novel, part love story, and imbued throughout with magical realism, the novel begins in 1984 Tokyo and alternates between the life of Aomame, a fitness instructor and part-time assassin, and Tengo, a math teacher and struggling writer.  Their isolated, austere existences take a rapid turn for the abnormal when Tengo agrees to ghostwrite and revise “Air Chrysalis,” the debut novel of Fuka-Eri—a precocious and extremely peculiar 17-year-old girl. Aomame and Tengo are hurtled into a subtly strange and different world, a sort of parallel universe that Aomame dubs “IQ84,” reasoning, “Q is for ‘question mark.’” Identical to 1984 except for a few marked differences in history, 1Q84 plays host to the conflicting and dangerous fallout that results from the mass publication of “Air Chrysalis.”
Murakami’s vivid descriptions enliven a world that is frequently bleak and unforgiving, where the machinations of the universe and his character’s own flaws often destroy their burgeoning possibilities of fulfillment and happiness. Through his evocative language, atmospheres full of foreboding, anticipation, and surrealism emerge. “The sky remained dark, as if covered with a lid, and the world wore a heavy dampness,” Murakami writes at one point, conjuring up a dismal, unsettling mood. His characterizations, which are likewise unique in their attention to analogy and detail, draw out a reality that is arrestingly realistic—until one begins to dig too deep.
The undercurrent of 1Q84 thus becomes its persistently ambiguous, dreamlike quality. Though Tengo and Aomame quickly realize that their new plane of existence has equally “real” repercussions as the real world, subtle nuances of language and description emerge to lend 1Q84 its most disturbing elements. While Murakami’s writing often relates a straightforward narrative, he also strikes a far deeper, more disquieting chord through his exploration of the nature of reality. “Things are not what they seem,” a mysterious cab driver warns Aomame moments before she enters 1Q84, “but don’t let appearances fool you. There is only one reality.” Tengo and Aomame individually notice subtle differences in the world they thought they knew, and once these holes emerge, it is only a matter of time before their conceptions of their new world begin to unravel.
Remarkable as well is Murakami’s incorporation of dozens of famous authors and their novels into his own sphere of imagination. “IQ84”—the title, the place, and several of the premises—is a clear reference to George Orwell’s “1984,” and with good reason: themes from “1984” form the basis of many of the situations in “1Q84,” from a controlling cult to an alternate world where small but seminal aspects of history have changed. As Tengo explains to Fuka-Eri, “history is our collective memory. If our collective memory is taken from us––is rewritten––we lose the ability to sustain our true selves.”
Murakami seems not to view previous literature as a constraint on his own authorial creativity. His references to literary compatriots like Orwell, Lewis Carroll, Anton Chekhov, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky flow freely and with purpose, serving not only as descriptive tools but also as a way to temporally ground—and ultimately confuse––the reader. Another ingenious aspect of the novel is Murakami’s exceptional self-reflexivity as an author. Describing the process of writing “Air Chrysalis,” the novel-within-a-novel structure sheds light on Murakami’s own struggles to bring this fantastical world to fruition. “When you introduce things that most readers have never seen before into a piece of fiction,” one character explains to Tengo, “you have to describe them with as much precision and in as much detail as possible. What you can eliminate from fiction is the description of things that most readers have seen.”
Though the plot is intriguing and the creativity behind it astounding, the most memorable and affecting aspect of “IQ84” is its haunting and ambiguous language concerning the nature of reality. “The line separating fact from hypothesis is practically invisible to the eye,” the cult’s leader says to a confused Aomame; later, while explaining the complex relationship between Tengo, Fuka-Eri and mysterious beings called the “Little People,” he utters the cryptic line “all things are arranged as mirrors set face-to-face.”
Disorientation is the name of Murakami’s game. Through his convoluted plot, complex temporal landscape, and indiscernible reality, this novel functions more as a discussion of deep, disturbing ideas than a traditional narrative. It is a rare feat, indeed, for an author to weave a story this complex while leaving so much up to the imagination. The book reads as both an allegory and a straightforward story, one of cosmic importance placed in an individual scale. The blending of these elements creates the triumph that is “1Q84”—“A world that bears a question.”

Everyone thinks that Crimson Arts is some super cool conglomerate of people with great taste and better haircuts. However, this is not the case. Some really uncool stuff has happened over the last year and I feel that I am perfectly situated to blow the whistle on these lapses in Arts’ hip persona.
• When Adam T. Horn ’13 stumbled into writers meeting roaring drunk and threw an empty Jack Daniels bottle at the Arts Chairs. It took three compers 25 minutes to restrain him.
• Alyssa A. Botelho ’13 chain smokes cigars in the Arts office and throws cats at the TV when she gets a Jeopardy question wrong.
• That one time Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13 beat me with a tire iron, which sucked because I totally didn’t deserve it.
• Keerthi Reddy ’14 wouldn’t stop insinuating terrible things about my mother during editing sessions. And she would laugh when I started crying.
• The chest hair of Alex E. Traub ’13. It’s gratuitous. Enough said.

As tumultuous and rife with ethnic and religious conflict as the Middle East is today, in the early 1940s moral courage and conviction led largely Muslim Turkish diplomats to save hundreds of Jews from the horrors of the Holocaust. The documentary film “The Turkish Passport,” which tells the story of these Jews, had its American premiere at Sanders Theatre on November 22. The premiere highlighted a crossroads of culture, cinema, and history and brought together local Turkish residents with Harvard students.
While the premiere was primarily focused on sharing the message of the intense and emotional 91-minute film “The Turkish Passport” with the Turkish and Harvard communities, it was the event’s co-chair Burak Eskici and the film’s producer Günes Çelikcan and director Burak Arlıel who set the tone for the evening by delivering heartfelt messages—which were translated from Turkish—of global peace and solidarity in speeches preceding the movie.
As Ibrahim Artukarslan, president of the World Platform of University Students—which co-sponsored the event along with Harvard University’s Turkish Students Association—said, “There is no better university than Harvard to spread this message of solidarity though all cultures in the world. With Harvard’s [extensive] student population, [the university is] a leader in the world and will help this documentary spread its humanitarian message of peace and action throughout the entire world.”
Outside Sanders, viewers were able to engage with representatives of a dozen Turkish banks and hotel chains that were also sponsors and were then led into Sanders Theatre for the premiere. Notable audience guests, such as Çelikcan were thanked in both Turkish and English for their involvement.  Meric Erik, a Turkish Boston resident who heard about this event though the Turkish Cultural Center in Boston, said that both she and her husband “are interested in the film and excited about the concept of Turkish solidarity”.
“The Turkish Passport” documents the little-known story of Turkish diplomats who risked their lives to provide Turkish passports to Jewish Turkish citizens in Nazi-occupied France. With a quick test of a couple of phrases in Turkish, Jews with descendants from Turkey would be given Turkish papers and were ultimately saved from the Nazi concentration camps. “The Turkish Passport” is a documentary containing hundreds of interviews from the French-Turkish Jews who made their way to Turkey in a10-day journey by train through war-torn Europe. However, it went beyond the scope of a traditional documentary by intertwining performances of professional actors and actresses with real-life interviews. The movie, presented in a mix of German, French, and Turkish with English subtitles, stressed the intensity of the natural dialects and maintained emotional authenticity that might have been lost in a translated version. In the end of the film, when the Jewish survivors finally found a safe haven in Muslim Turkey, the message stressed by the filmmakers became apparent; as Artukarslan said before the movie screened, “We can prove that even this terrible war and eventually the Cold War can have a happy ending.”
According to Eskici, the movie represents a move by domestic and foreign Turkish affiliated associations to foster peace in the Middle East as tensions have grown in recent years. The movie world-premiered as Turkey’s international entry in the 64th Cannes Film Festival and was selected for the “Show Case” in the Lucerne film festival.
Hundreds of people gathered in the lobby of Sanders Theatre to see copies of mandates from the leaders of the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic confirming the history of religious tolerance in the country for non-Muslim denominations. Eskici said, “The event, both the reception and showing of the movie, provide a story that is a ray of light within this deep darkness, a ray of light that is of tolerance and heroism, showing that when people stand up against injustice, good things can come of it.”

Token black guy (n.)–A black character deliberately featured in a show or movie for the sake of racial diversity.
5. Lando Calrissian of “Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back” and “Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi”
Lando first appears in “The Empire Strikes Back” as the administrator of Cloud City, where he promptly turns his friend Han Solo over to a bounty hunter shortly after his arrival. But like any good black friend, he goes back to rescue Solo and ends up leading the Rebel Alliance to victory by destroying the second Death Star. Even though his actions were a bit sketchy at the beginning, we all knew that Calrissian had Han’s back all along.
4. James “Toofer” Spurlock of “30 Rock”
James Spurlock writes for the fictional sketch comedy show “TGS with Tracy Jordan.” According to network executive Jack Donaghy, Spurlock’s nickname is “Toofer” because “with him you get a two-for-one; he’s a black guy and a Harvard guy.” While Tina Fey’s character Liz Lemon did mention that Toofer is afraid of other black people, he still ranks on this list because he reps his alma mater proudly. (I don’t see any school pride coming from the token black Yalies out there…)
3. Benjamin Buford “Bubba” Blue of “Forrest Gump”
Bubba first meets Forrest while they are both serving in the Army and was originally supposed to go into business with him after the war. Not only was he Forrest’s best friend (like a brother from another mother), but he could also cook shrimp in 22 different ways from memory (definite bonus points). Unfortunately, the relationship between the two men is cut short when Bubba is killed in Vietnam—which makes him the first main character to die in the movie.
2. Wayne Brady of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?”
Wayne Brady is perhaps best known for his improvisational work on the comedy show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” While various comedians have poked fun at Brady’s popularity amongst suburban soccer moms, it is Brady who gets the last laugh with his successful hosting career and three individual Emmy Awards to fall back on. After his visit to Harvard last spring, it is very clear that he is still “winning.”
1. Token Black of “South Park”
Token Black is the only black kid in South Park and as such is at the center of every black joke made on the show. Unlike most other token black kids, Token also belongs to the wealthiest family in South Park and is one of the most popular kids at school. A group of good friends and lots of money? Maybe tokenism isn’t so bad after all.

There is a sacred tradition among Arts Chairs of picking up articles and writing them during production—a full 48 hours after a draft is supposed to be sent in. This is commonly referred to as “Pulling a Meehan.” I have tried to avoid this as much as possible this semester but for this issue several things have prevented me from being a responsible Crimson arts editor.
5. Writers’ block – As Arts Chair I was privy to all the incoming and outgoing associates ideas for Vanity Lists. Their brilliant ideas intimidated me and paralyzed me. For example, my fellow Arts Chair Antonia M.R. Peacocke, created memes for our associates. All of them were hilarious. I’m not very funny and this made me depressed. And as we all know, the best reaction to depression is cripplingly long periods of sleep.
4. Academics – The draft for my junior literature paper was due the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Thus I spent the proceeding three days not sleeping and working on it—by which I mean I spent about 24 hours in total browsing 9gag, /b/, and r/trees. The paper, by the way, was about the Joker—yes, from Batman—and literary theories of laughter with reference to works of Johan Huizinga, Henri Bergson, and Friedrich Nietzsche.
3. Resentment – It would make Antonia M.R. Peacocke too happy if I finally did something for the arts section on time. She has enough going for her, most notably her adorable dimples and her tight ass, for me to make her life easier by being punctual.
2. Magic the Gathering – Despite the fact that I’m widely known to be too cool for most things in life, I am actually secretly a huge basement neck-beard nerd. One of the things that betray this fact is that I am an avid MtG player. In fact I am currently considering becoming a professional player upon my graduation. Anyway, I spent a large portion of the weekend at my local game shop The Friendly Troll, watching a tournament and also working on a new deck. It’s a goblin artifact burn deck.
1. Unanticipated Adventures – I live blogged my attempt to return to Boston after Thanksgiving from Toronto on Facebook and it’s a long and convoluted story but I will retell it here. I missed my 6:50 p.m. flight because of the ridiculous line-up to get through customs. I attempted to get on the 8:25 p.m. flight but I couldn’t make it off the waitlist. Instead of being a normal human being and taking a flight in the morning, I decided to take the 9:15 p.m. to Newark, and take the New Jersey Transit at 11:15 p.m. to New York Penn Station, to take the midnight Greyhound bus to Boston. The Newark flight was delayed, and all that went to hell. I ended up spending 1 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. wandering 42nd Street, getting free coffee at Starbucks, and being asked by cabbies if I was going to Brooklyn—I was wearing flannel. I got back to my dorm room in the quad at 9 a.m. this morning but showed up to production anyway. Like a boss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University is composed of people who excel at many things, but  particularly at self-promotion. Our student body is full of trumpeted  musicians, heralded journalists, and lauded dancers. Thus, it might be  tempting, nay easy, for one to feign expertise in order to impress your  fellow Annenburglars, for how do they know you aren’t truly the artistic  prodigy of your generation? Anyone could do it—so here are five  incredibly simple ways to tell if your companion really is a true Artist  or merely a poseur.
1. Does she like the bathroom decor at Café Pamplona?
You can  pepper your suspected pseudo-intellectual/hipster with trick questions  that lead her to support something unforgivably stupid (Protip: Café  Pamplona doesn’t have a bathroom). My favorites: “Do you think that ‘Les  Miserables’ accurately represents the French Revolution?” “Why aren’t  coffee and cigarettes a suitable lunch?” or “Do you think that Banksy is  attractive?”
2. Is “Lolita” his favorite book?
You can’t lose with this one.  If he defends his “hipster cred” by saying that Vladimir Nabokov’s  “Lolita” is indeed his favorite book, then he is not a hipster; he is a  poseur attempting to be controversial by liking a book about pedophilia.  If he says Vladimir Nabokov’s “Ada” is his favorite book, then call him  a liar because “Lolita” is better written. If “Catcher in the Rye” is  his favorite, challenge him to a duel (if he declines, you can be sure  he is a phony).
3. What is her concentration?
If she is concentrating in anything  that doesn’t prompt queries of “What does one do with that  concentration?” or the ever-pitiful “I guess you can always teach,” then  she is not a true Artist. The acceptable Artist concentrations include  Visual and Environmental Studies, Literature, any of the Languages  (bonus points for more obscure fields such as Celtic), English,  Philosophy, and Folklore & Mythology. Unacceptable Artist  concentrations are Government, Economics and anything that has a class  in the Science Center.
4. Does he loudly bash artists such as Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black, and Robert Pattinson?
If  he laments the five-adjective masterpiece of “Twilight” or the odd  musical obsession with ranking the days of the week, then he is not an  Artist. It’s much more artistic to be contrarian and say that Bieber  Fever is the greatest cultural contagion since the Unhealable Boils of  Exodus or that Rebecca Black’s simple proclamation that Friday is the  best day of the week is indicative of a societal emphasis on the values  of Norse God “Friga” who oversaw love, beauty, and sex. It’s boring just  to be a hater.
5. Does he chew ice?
If he chews ice and eschews spinach, then  you can be positive that your subject is neither a Hipster nor an  Artist. This means he has anemia, and it is a qualification that all  true Artists must have highly oxygenated blood. I guess you could say  this is because they must be ... ironic.

It’s a sad fact that the Arts movies section has a poor track record when it comes to recommendations. Just last issue, in the “Viewers Might Also Enjoy” box, we dubiously claimed that those who liked “Twilight: Breaking Dawn” would also be into “The Lizzie McGuire Movie.” We’ve even plugged “Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home” and “Free Willy 3: The Rescue”—without actually watching them—just because we thought it was funny.
To make amends for these derelictions of duty, I had the movies section interns compile a list of quality television shows that were conveniently cancelled after one or two seasons. Spanning the genre gamut from sci-fi to political drama, these short-but-sweet gems make ideal fare for reading period procrastinators.
Murder One
“Murder One” is the “24” of legal dramas. Instead of presenting viewers with a “case of the week,” the show’s first season offers a single high profile mega-case—think O.J. Simpson-esque—which unfolds over the course of 23 episodes. Part mystery, part courtroom thriller, the intricate and riveting plot is brought to life by an elite cast headlined by Daniel Benzali as stentorian über-lawyer Ted Hoffman, and supported by stalwarts Stanley Tucci and Dylan Baker. (The show lost half its cast, the one-season/one-case premise, and most of its originality in its second season, so don’t bother with that.)
Firefly
“Buffy” creator Joss Whedon’s criminally-cancelled witty, gritty sci-fi Western—which featured Nathan Fillion before he became famous on “Castle,” Adam Baldwin before “Chuck,” and Christina Hendricks before “Mad Men,” among others—is one of the bestselling TV shows of the DVD age. In 2006, it ranked #12 on Amazon’s bestseller list, above 2005 releases “Brokeback Mountain,” “Crash,” and the first two seasons of “The Office.” The catch? “Firefly” hit DVD in 2003. If you haven’t seen what Orson Scott Card called “the best space-opera sci-fi series ever on television,” now’s the time.
Jack & Bobby
Imagine watching a documentary history of Abraham Lincoln’s conduct during the Civil War, intercut with scenes of his childhood which are cast as explanations for actions like his suspension of habeas corpus. “Jack & Bobby” is basically that show, except with a fictional president. As a premise for a political drama, this is absurdly reductive and patently ridiculous—but boy is it fun to watch. Stars Matt Long and John Slattery pre-“Mad Men,” and Logan Lerman—now teen heartthrob—as the cute kid who will be president.
Pushing Daisies
It’s probably safe to say that Bryan Fuller’s show is the only fantasy/romantic-comedy/crime drama you will ever see. It stars, in order of appearance: a pie chef who can bring things back from the dead by touching them, but kills them again with any further physical contact; a private detective who partners with him to solve murders by asking victims who killed them; and a childhood sweetheart whom the pie-maker brings back to life, but cannot touch her for fear of offing her once more. All narrated by Jim Dale of Harry Potter audiobook fame? Sign me up!
Kings
A Shakespearean epic with stunning production values, “Kings” retells the biblical story of King David’s rise to power in a modern setting. The show’s well-realized world is so engrossing and Ian McShane’s performance as the tragic King Silas is so mesmerizing that you won’t even notice how the Prophet Samuel has been recast as the minister of a non-denominational church, despite the fact that he’s actually, you know, a Jewish prophet. Or that the entire biblical storyline for “Kings” actually appears in the Book of Samuel. Oh, you wouldn’t have noticed any of that? Well, I did.

For me, there’s nothing better than a film with a great dance sequence—the kind that propels you off the couch to shamelessly bust a move in the living room. Here are a few of my favorite dance clips that have stood the test of time, presented from most recent to oldest. This is by no means a complete or authoritative list—as a ballet dancer, I have too many clips to name.
As Reading Period approaches, indulge in watching a clip or two of your own favorite dance scenes—and have a little boogie in the privacy of your Lamont cubicle. I know I will.
5. PULP FICTION (1994)—The Dance Off at Jack Rabbit Slim’s
Honestly, this entire list could consist of John Travolta dance sequences. But Travolta’s dance off as hitman Vincent Vega with mobster wife Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) has to be among the least expected dances in Travolta’s film career. Performing a mean twist in a surreal 1950s-themed diner, Vincent and Mia’s dance off illuminates the brilliance of “Pulp Fiction:” its ability to parody pop culture without patronizing those who enjoy it.
http://youtu.be/Ik-RsDGPI5Y
 
4. DIRTY DANCING (1987)—(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life
The iconic American summer romance between Baby (Jennifer Grey) and her dance teacher Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze) continues to make women swoon, despite the film’s corny plotline. Baby’s final lift at the summer camp performance is shamelessly cheesy—but hey, you know you want to try it.
http://youtu.be/WpmILPAcRQo
3. FAME (1980)—Dancing in the NYC Streets
This is the original flash mob, the scene that makes you wish you had chosen art school (before you watch the rest of the film and your misgivings return). Never mind the kids’ poufy hair and the fantastically high-cut leotards—the 80s were a great time for dance in the movies.
http://youtu.be/UZASveVzcV0
2. MARY POPPINS (1964)—“Step in Time”
Who knew that chimney sweeps could be so groovy? Bert’s (Dick Van Dyke) cart-wheels across London’s rooftops and shouts of  “Kick your knees up!” and “Flap like a birdie!” are priceless. This is a dance that champions a youthful spirit and a sense of humor, no matter how dusty the job.
http://youtu.be/9JJefXU-a7o
1. SINGIN’ IN THE RAIN (1952)—The Rain Scene
This most beloved dance routine shows Gene Kelly at his best, hanging from lampposts and stomping in puddles with that inexplicable giddiness of falling in love. Only Kelly can move with such flair while sopping wet—with an umbrella as dance partner, no less.

What’s your favorite part of “Harry Potter”? Heroism? The ancient struggle between good and evil? Mystery? Emma Watson, you say?
Wrong. The best part of “Harry Potter” is the cats.
6. Millicent Bulstrode’s cat – Before the pangs of adolescence and Horcruxes struck the trio, they had to contend with a case of mistaken cat-dentity.  Under the impression that she had collected the hair of this female Slytherin student, Hermione instead concocted a Polyjuice potion containing the hair of Millicent’s cat––and temporarily turned herself into a cat-human hybrid.
5. Mrs. Norris – The caretaker Filch’s skeletal gray cat slunk around the castle for seven books. Besides shooting sly glares at misbehaving students, her most exciting adventure was getting petrified by the basilisk.
4. Mrs. Figg’s cats – Though a Squib, Mrs. Figg kept in touch with the magical community by breeding Kneazles––magical cat-like creatures with high intelligence and the ability to discern suspicious occurrences. Mr. Tibbles alerted his owner to Dudley and Harry’s dementor attack, and Snowy, Tufty, and Mr. Paws rounded out the veritable cat menagerie.
3. Dolores Umbridge – Besides having a Persian cat as her Patronus, the toad-like professor and Ministry of Magic employee also decorated her office with ornamental plates, each depicting a kitten with a bow around its neck. Described as garish and horrible, I’ll admit––despite my own love of felines––that these cats were as rotten as Umbridge herself.
2. Crookshanks – “It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,” Harry remarked the first time he met Hermione’s squashed-faced, bowlegged ginger cat Crookshanks. Half-Kneazle, he was intelligent, rambunctious, and the perfect companion for a night by the fire in the Gryffindor common room. I was pretty jealous.
1. Minerva McGonagall – It was a close tie, but McGonagall as a silver tabby Animagus narrowly beat out Crookshanks as my all-time favorite Potter cat.

So far so good for a return to the old way of admissions. Harvard College recently announced that it has received 4,245 applications in its first early action application cycle since 2006. When Harvard announced the reversal of its decision to end early admissions, along with Princeton, in February 2011, we agreed with the choice to consider early action applications so long as the system would be carefully guarded against disadvantaging students from lower socio-economic or rural backgrounds and used to help increase campus diversity. The College’s admissions office should do what it can to attract the most talented and diverse applicants possible to submit early applications. In the recent announcement, Dean William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 spoke of the striking diversity of the early action applicants; assuming Harvard can deliver on its pledge to attract more diverse students at this stage, the advantages of the policy change are not limited to attracting the best talent.
In recent years, college admissions has become so competitive that high school seniors regularly apply to a dozen or more colleges and lose the ability to put careful thought into each college to which they apply. Colleges, in turn, are driven to market themselves aggressively and recruit as many applicants (and later matriculates) as possible, knowing that they are, for many students, but one of an extensive list of attractive options. Though many interpret the College’s reintroduction of early action as an exacerbation of this vicious cycle, we believe that early action in fact does the opposite: In choosing just one out of a number of colleges that offer single-choice early admissions programs applicants are compelled to research their options carefully and apply early to the college that best suits their needs. In light of this, we welcome the success of Harvard’s first early action cycle in five years, and we encourage colleges to use early admissions to market their individuality and promote discernment in the college search.
The race for the greatest number of applicants has resulted in a “vanilla” marketing strategy among colleges—instead of advertising their distinct personalities to high school students colleges often try to make themselves appear to be all things to all applicants, an approach that is unhelpful and misleading. Colleges should be frank about their strengths, weaknesses, and campus culture. For instance, Harvard may not be an ideal choice for a student who strives to be the best at everything that they do and admissions officers would do well to point that out. Because students often can only apply early to one private college, like Harvard, and one state or public school, the early admissions cycle requires applicants to choose carefully. This will hopefully incentivize colleges to accentuate their individuality.
This focus on presenting a college’s individuality should help the admissions office to work with a clearly defined approach toward an early action program that does not recreate the same situation that led to its abolition in 2006. While we are glad to see Harvard’s administration, including Dean Fitzsimmons, stress the importance of working hard at increasing diversity among early applicants, without greater transparency about the applicants students, prospective students, and our wider community have no way of telling how fruitful results have been. Dean Fitzsimmons’ recent statement that the pool of 4,245 applicants is “a very diverse group ethnically” is scant in detail and not necessarily a sign of increased socio-economic diversity among early applicants. Popular criticism of early action and early decision programs, not just at Harvard but across many schools, has focused on its exploitation by legacy students looking to apply where they know they have the best chance before others have made up their minds or have the support structure to complete an early application.
Given that Harvard’s undergraduate classes have been substantially diverse for some time now, a very ethnically diverse group might conceivably also be full of legacy applicants, or else simply students from a privileged background. While a raw statistical breakdown of this year’s applicants will likely not emerge until April or May 2012, we urge the admissions office to make early action a true opportunity to find the applicants for whom Harvard is the best fit—wherever and in whatever circumstance they grow up. We are glad to see so many applicants applying through early action, and hope that it makes applicants think hard about where they really see themselves going to school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a scene in the new film “Margin Call”—a fictionalized retelling of the first 24 hours of the 2008 financial crisis—in which a recently-fired risk analyst sits on his front porch and reflects on his life’s work. As his thoughts float back through time, it’s not his contributions to the investment bank where he was employed that come to mind; instead it’s his work as an engineer prior to joining the firm when he built a bridge that saved commuters countless hours of travel time each day. That’s what the analyst lacked in his work at the investment bank: It didn’t allow him to create anything.
Watching the scene and reflecting on my own undergraduate education, I realized that it has instilled in me, above all else, a desire to create something. I remember the moment when this desire began to crystallize in me; it was during freshman year when I met with a professor during office hours who pushed me to consider the logical implications of an argument I was making. When she finally drew out an unexpected repercussion, the thrill of discovery hit us both. I expect that many other students have had similar experiences and it seems that many of us emerge from Harvard with this creative instinct intact—we want to make something that will contribute to the world in a concrete way.
It is somewhat surprising therefore, that around this time every year we see countless students recruiting for jobs at consulting and finance firms. These are often the same students whose original ideas impressed us in class—some of our most creative, intelligent, and accomplished peers. It’s also the time of year when we see a backlash against many of these students. This year, the backlash is embodied in the Occupy Harvard movement, which (among other claims) argues that Harvard graduates in the financial sector have contributed to growing economic inequality in the United States.
These attacks on individuals entering the financial industry are rarely constructive. The more intriguing question is why students—many of whom, like me, were inspired to create during their years at Harvard—eschew careers in the more “creative” professions and pursue work in the financial world. Why are we creating profits instead of bridges?
I think that much of the answer has to do with the resources devoted to career counseling for students whose interests point them toward occupations outside the world of finance and consulting. Certainly some students enter this world because of the financial benefits, but for others it’s simply the most visible and defined career path after graduation. Students can meet with recruiters and interview on campus; the Office of Career Services provides extensive counseling for undergraduates pursuing finance or consulting careers. Many students work in internships during the summer after their junior year; by the end of the summer some have job offers in hand and can go through senior year with defined post-graduation plans while their friends frantically search for job listings and interview opportunities.
Searching for a career outside finance or consulting often comes with more uncertainty than searching for a career within this profession. As a result, students often need to be counseled extensively when searching for opportunities in non-finance fields. Opportunities for such counseling currently exist at Harvard, but they often aren’t advertised extensively and can be overshadowed by the highly visible recruiters who descend on campus each year. The OCS could more effectively highlight its counseling opportunities for students interested in engineering, politics, or academia and could more aggressively reach out to students interested in these fields. Currently, OCS’s extensive finance career counseling services are not an example of a response to students’ demand for careers in these fields; instead, the supply of these services inflates demand for careers that might not otherwise be as attractive to students.
As seniors near their thesis deadlines and eventually their graduation dates, thoughts of post-college plans inevitably hang over their heads. Right now, the ease of enter the consulting and finance fields means that students with diverse interests and creative impulses are streamlined into these professions, even if they’re more willing—and more suited—to entering other occupations. So why are we creating profits instead of bridges? It’s not because we’re uncreative; it’s because profits—and the careers associated with them—simply come easier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Imagine saying we should shut down a hospital and fire its staff because not all of its patients became healthy—but never demanding that the patients also look out for themselves by eating properly, exercising, and laying off cigarettes.” Teacher union leader Al Shanker’s characterization of American education policy still rings true today. The rash of reforms over the past two decades, from initiatives during the Clinton administration to Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act to Obama’s Race to the Top program, have sought to improve test scores by focusing almost entirely on school accountability with little or no attempt to hold students to a higher standard. Demanding better performance from schools and teachers is a good start, but part of the answer to America’s mediocre educational performance lies in asking more of students.
There is substantial room for our students to improve. Among developed countries, the United States ranks 17 in high school reading proficiency and 32 in math proficiency. The situation is particularly dire for racial minorities. Only 15 percent of Hispanics and 11 percent of African Americans are proficient in these subjects, compared to a little less than half of whites.
NCLB set out to improve these outcomes by mandating that all public school students be proficient in math and reading by 2014 and imposing sanctions against schools that failed to make “adequate yearly progress” toward this goal. The law appears to have had some success in raising math scores, but has had little or no impact on reading proficiency, and has made minimal headway in closing racial achievement gaps.
One problem with NCLB is that it focuses solely on school accountability, which is only part of the problem. Many parents set high academic standards for their children and some students have the foresight to apply themselves for the sake of their futures. But the school system itself gives students little immediate incentive to study harder. Comprehensive school reform would supplement school accountability with student accountability, mandating remedial instruction for underperforming students and perhaps rewarding those who excel.
The most obvious way to motivate students is by predicating grade promotion and graduation on test performance. While a few states have implemented minimum-competency tests that students must pass before graduating, these tend to affect only a few students at the bottom of the score distribution. Research shows that in European and Asian countries in which graduation from secondary school is contingent upon curriculum-based exit exams like France’s Baccalaureate, students outperform their American counterparts by a grade level or more in some subjects.
Another possibility would be to institute student accountability in terms of educational inputs. One of the more successful aspects of NCLB is a program called Supplemental Education Services which provides vouchers for private after-school tutoring to low-income families whose children attend failing schools. The program seems to have boosted test scores, particularly among minority students in inner cities. But participation rates are woefully low—less than 5 percent among eligible high school students—at least partly because families simply fail to use the vouchers. A mandatory after-school remedial program like SES could help underperforming students raise their scores while giving them an incentive to do so.
Schools can also motivate students with positive reinforcement by paying them for performance. In a 2010 study that used randomized trials in over 250 urban schools, Harvard economist Roland G. Fryer, Jr. found that financial incentives for educational inputs (e.g. paying students to read books) can significantly increase achievement. In fact, relative to education reforms of the past few decades, financial incentives “produce similar gains in achievement at lower costs.”
Another problem with NCLB is that its school accountability standards are relatively weak. According to the law, underperforming schools only face serious consequences after five years of failing to meet average yearly progress requirements and in many cases little or no action is taken even then. This is due in large part to the powerful influence of teacher unions, who are usually able to block attempts at school and teacher accountability including school choice, merit pay, and tenure reform.
Unlike these ideas, student accountability does not threaten the jobs or wages of teachers. While exit exams and mandatory tutoring might be a drag (at least in the short run) for the underperforming students who would have to work harder, very few of them are old enough to vote and whatever parental opposition these measures might attract would be far less intense than an American Federation of Teachers’ campaign against private school vouchers. Given the political difficulty of mandating higher standards for schools and teachers, student accountability might be the most realistic—and perhaps the most effective—way of improving educational outcomes.

In response to the growing hostility toward discussion of the abortion issue on campus and dissolution into name-calling, as seen in the impressively consistent vandalism of Harvard Right to Life’s poster campaigns, I’d like to present a philosophical argument for the pro-life position. HRL’s innocuous “Smile, your mom chose life.” posters have been ripped down within hours of posting almost without exception. At a school where free speech and diversity are valued so highly, this is a travesty. However, it seems to follow from the fact that the Harvard community limits its dialogue about abortion to religion and politics. I will set these aside to address the ethics of the situation, without which reasonable discussion is impossible.
The reason there is so much tension and so little understanding between individuals of differing opinions on the abortion issue is that the two sides approach it from completely different angles. The “pro-choice” side emphasizes women and their rights while the pro-life side focuses on the other person involved. We can all agree that women should have control over their bodies—but it is imperative to determine whether or not a second person is involved before we can talk about women’s rights.
The philosophical argument for life has two simple premises one from natural value and one from natural science.
The premise based on natural value is that all human beings have the right to life because they are human. Surprisingly enough, this is the premise that most pro-abortion philosophers will disagree with in the modern debate—they will deny universal values altogether and argue instead that values are simply subjective.
The premise based on natural science is that the life of each individual mammal begins at conception. Modern science has made it nearly impossible to defend the view that the fetus is not human, considering that from the moment of conception it has human DNA, so the issue centers on personhood. If the human is a person only when neurologically functioning as a human, then by that same argument it would be permissible to kill people while they are in deep sleep, in comas, or mentally handicapped. Similar arguments can be made for location and viability. The only time when we can consistently argue the human fetus becomes a person is when he or she becomes human: at conception.
The most compelling argument for abortion is denying that the fetus is a person. If one can do this absolutely, then abortion is not wrong. If one rejects one of the above premises, I’d like to ask him to consider the following quadrilemma. We begin with two new premises: The fetus is a person or is not a person, and we either know it or we don’t know it. We end up with four possible outcomes.
In the first case, the fetus is a person and we know it, so abortion is the deliberate killing of an innocent person. In this case, abortion is murder and therefore is always wrong. Alternatively, if the fetus is a person, but we don’t know it, then abortion is killing a person unintentionally—manslaughter. Even if the fetus is not a person, but we don’t know it, abortion qualifies as criminal negligence. Without perfect certainty that the fetus is not a person, doing anything to endanger its potential personhood is morally indefensible. Only in the final case, if the fetus is not a person and we know it definitively, is abortion morally permissible.
Therefore, if we can’t prove or disprove the personage of the fetus, the strongest argument of the pro-abortion viewpoint becomes one of the strongest philosophical defenses for the pro-life position. Abortion can only be permissible if the fetus is definitively not a person. Those who are pro-life believe that the fetus is a person, but even those who are skeptical of this point should not be advocates of abortion. And those who think they do know, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the fetus is not human should engage in meaningful dialogue instead of throwing tantrums, calling names, and ripping down posters.

A new fellowship to support students enrolled in a joint degree program between the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Law School will be granted beginning in the fall of 2012, the Kennedy School announced yesterday.
The fellowship will be granted in memory of Henry A. Hubschman, a 1972 graduate of the Law School and 1973 graduate of the Kennedy School, who died of cancer at the age of 63 last February.
The fellowship, which is funded by a permanent endowment, will be one of the limited merit-based competitive fellowships offered by either school.
“Educating students about the issues at the intersection of law and public policy is key to the Kennedy School’s mission of training exceptional public leaders,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood in the school’s press release.
“This gift will help us attract and engage the very best students to Harvard,” Ellwood added.
Since being formalized in 2006, the objective of the HKS/HLS Joint Degree Program has been to promote interdisciplinary education in public policy and law, in order to prepare students for public service leadership.
The fellowship aims to encourage the brightest students to pursue this joint academic venture, especially in a world where critical issues demand cross-field knowledge in law and policy, said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in the press release.
The fellowship also honors Hubschman’s own involvement in careers pertaining to law, government, and business during his lifetime.
In business, Hubschman was widely recognized as a leader in the aviation industry, as President and CEO of GE Capital Aviation Services.
Prior to his time at GE, Hubschman worked in Washington D.C. as a nationally recognized litigation partner at the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson. During the Carter era, he served as Executive Assistant to the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and later served as a board member of the Federal National Mortgage Association.
“This fellowship is a perfect tribute to Henry,” said Ben W. Heineman Jr., a longtime friend of Hubschman and a distinguished senior fellow at the HLS Program on the Legal Profession. “He had a brilliant professional career at the intersection of law, policy, politics and business, and was always grateful for the skills and perspectives he developed as a joint degree student almost 40 years ago.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christina Bellantoni, a political reporter for the Washington newspaper “Roll Call,” discussed the merits and potential pitfalls of using Twitter in politics on Monday evening at the Institute of Politics.
“The ability to be connected is invaluable,” Bellantoni said. “Twitter helps us learn about each other and the world.”
At the “Twitter Summit,” Bellantoni, an IOP Fellow, described how Twitter has radically changed political journalism in recent years.
She said that Twitter’s “unbelievably fast speed” has enabled a groundbreaking alacrity in the dissemination of news. Reporters can now present vital information sooner, before their detailed articles have been written, edited, and published, she said.
Bellantoni said that she personally uses Twitter to highlight interesting details overlooked by print newspapers.
But frequent Twitter-use comes with occasional drawbacks, according to Bellantoni. She said that her tweets have occasionally drawn intense scrutiny from followers.
“You have to develop a very thick skin,” Bellantoni said.
Bellantoni warned that Twitter, with its limited content controls can facilitate the rapid spread of false information.
Although journalists “lose prose” on Twitter accounts, Bellantoni emphasized that the benefits of connectivity far outweigh the drawbacks of condensing complex thoughts into 140 characters.
Bellantoni then turned the subject of her talk to undergraduates’ use of Twitter, offering some advice on how to use Twitter most effectively.
Bellantoni said that students on Twitter should assume that embarrassing posts have the potential to ruin professional reputations and future political careers.
“It’s hard to scrub bad things off the internet,” Bellantoni said. “Politics is an ugly, dirty game.”
She recommended that students use “Tweetdeck,” an interactive tool that organizes tweets and contacts into easily manageable lists, and encouraged them to keep their posts short and to include a picture on their profiles.
Bellantoni urged students to experiment with Twitter and explore its resources.
“The best way to build up who you want to follow is to just click around,” said Bellantoni. “There’s no perfect formula.”

The Office of Faculty Development and Diversity included the first-ever historical overview of the role of tenured women professors across Harvard University in its 2011 Annual Report.
Published yesterday, the report found that women now comprise 26 percent of Harvard’s 1,570 ladder faculty members, 63 years since Harvard tenured its first female professor.
The report features a seventy-year timeline highlighting the careers of the first five tenured women professors in each school of the University as well as notable milestones in the inclusion of women at Harvard.
“We saw this timeline as an opportunity to honor the appointments of women, and to give people a continued sense of urgency to diversify the faculty with respect to gender,” said Judith D. Singer, senior vice provost of the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity and curator of the report.
Since Helen Maud Cam became the first woman to receive tenure from Harvard in 1948, the number of tenured females has steadily increased. Today, 22 percent of tenured professors are female, up from 18 percent in 2004. Among junior faculty, 36 percent are female, up from 34 percent in 2004.
But the number of women in the sciences remains proportionately lower than in other areas of study.
At the Medical School and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, women comprise 16 percent and 10 percent of senior faculty, respectively. In natural sciences at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—the University’s largest school—women comprise 13 percent of senior faculty.
The gradual inclusion of women in the academic community was a process that occurred through a variety of ways at each of Harvard’s schools.
In FAS, Samuel Zemurray, Jr. and Doris Zemurray-Stone established the Radcliffe Professorship in 1947, which reserved a senior faculty position for a distinguished woman scholar.
The next schools to include women among their ranks were the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Graduate School of Education—“‘women’s work’ schools,” according to Singer.
In other schools, including Harvard Law School, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Kennedy School, the inclusion of women has only occurred more recently. In fact, a number of these pioneering women are still active in the classroom.
Law School Professor Martha A. Field ’65 was the second female to receive tenure at the Law School and has had the longest career at Harvard of all the tenured women currently teaching.
“We continue to make progress, but it’s definitely slow-going,” said Singer, who pointed out that because the vast majority of faculty members will stay on from year to year, any demographic change will naturally occur “at the margin.”
Government Professor Theda R. Skocpol, who received tenure from FAS in 1985 and also served as the second female dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, pointed out other factors that could explain the continued unequal gender representation among Harvard faculty.
“A lot of times, women get left out not because they are prejudiced against, but what’s defined as exciting scholarship is primarily defined in terms of men’s point of view,” said Skocpol.

Occupy Harvard’s push for the University to not reinvest in HEI Hotels & Resorts—a corporation under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board for poor labor practices—gained momentum last week when Yale University announced that it would not reinvest in the corporation.
Yale is now the third Ivy League university to officially state that it will not reinvest in HEI. Earlier this year, both Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania committed to not reinvesting in the company.
Objection to Harvard’s investment in HEI has been a top priority of the Occupy Harvard movement, which formulated a list of demands two weeks ago.
The demand for non-reinvestment has become more prominent since custodial contract negotiations, another item on the Occupy agenda, were settled earlier this month. Occupiers are now hopeful that Yale’s decision will spur the Harvard Management Company to follow suit.
“A precedent has been set among our peer institutions for publicly committing to not reinvest in HEI,” said Samuel F. Wohns ’14, a Occupy Harvard student organizer and Crimson Magazine editor. “I hope that the Harvard Management Company will make that same public commitment.”
Wohns said that he feels that Harvard’s investment in HEI is inconsistent with the University’s mission as a non-profit institution to serve the public good.
“In my mind, socially conscious universities like Harvard, have no business investing in companies and funds that exploit their workers and have a track record of violating labor laws,” Wohns said.
Wohns said that he feels that Yale’s move has greatly strengthened Occupy Harvard’s demand.
“As the weeks and months go on, our momentum is gaining, and as our peer institutions are making this decision we are gaining steam—over a thousand students have spoken out on this issue,” Wohns said. “I think its a good sign for what’s to come here at Harvard.”
Brian Lang, president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents Harvard Dining Hall Workers and is a branch of the union that also represents HEI hotel workers, said he hopes that Yale’s decision to not reinvest will force Harvard to take a “good, hard look at its investments and make a socially responsible choice.”
Lang added that he thinks Harvard respects its workers’ rights and hopes that the University will invest in companies that uphold the same standards.
The University declined to comment.

Harvard Medical School Professor Donald M. Berwick ’68, a controversial figure in the health care policy field, announced last week that he will step down from his position as chief administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the end of this week.
“Don Berwick did outstanding work at CMS,” Jamie Smith, White House deputy press secretary, told the Washington Post last week. “It’s unfortunate that a small group of senators obstructed his nomination, putting political interests above the best interests of the American people.”
Since his nomination to the CMS in April 2010, Berwick has been caught in the middle of the heated partisan debate on Capitol Hill over health care policy.
President Obama nominated Berwick only a month after the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often derisively called “Obamacare” by opponents, had been signed into law. At the time of Berwick’s nomination, the mood on Capitol Hill remained tense, and ultimately Republicans blocked Berwick’s nomination, strongly objecting to his past statements on health care policy and support of the British National Heath Service.
Detractors pointed to a 2008 speech Berwick gave at the British National Health Service’s 60th anniversary. During the speech, Berwick expressed his support for the British health care system, which is largely government-run, and health care redistribution.
“Any health care funding plan that is just, equitable, civilized, and humane must—must—redistribute wealth from the richer among us to the poorer and less fortunate,” Berwick said. “Excellent health care is by definition redistribution.”
Opponents also claimed that Berwick favors health care rationing. They highlighted an interview Berwick gave with Biotechnology Healthcare in June 2009.
“The decision is not whether or not we will ration care—the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open,” Berwick told the journal. “And right now, we are doing it blindly.”
But Berwick has vehemently denied claims that he is in favor of health care rationing.
“Every bone in my body, as a physician, even as a person, is to get everything [patients] want and need and to help them at every step,” Berwick told the Washington Post in July. “I have gone to the mat to get a last-ditch bone marrow transplant for a child with leukemia . . . and they are telling me I’m rationing? They haven’t met me.”
Conservative opposition to Berwick’s appointment was so staunch that his confirmation hearing was never scheduled. It seemed unlikely Berwick would be confirmed by the Senate, so, in an effort to bypass the Senate, Obama made Berwick CMS chief administrator by a temporary recess appointment in July 2010.
Berwick’s provisory appointment would have expired on December 31, and his term could have been extended through the Senate confirmation process. But many have said that Berwick’s nomination would not have succeeded in the Senate confirmation process since 42 Republican senators signed a pledge to block further consideration of Berwick earlier this year.
As chief CMS administrator, Berwick was responsible for implementing new healthcare policy regulations, many of which stem from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
It is  unclear whether Berwick will return to Harvard after he leaves his post at the end of this week. At the Medical School, Berwick held a part-time appointment as a member of the Health Care Policy and Pediatrics departments. Berwick also served as the President and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a healthcare policy think tank.
Barbara J. McNeil, chair of the Health Care Policy department at HMS, said she would welcome a chance to re-appoint Berwick.
“We’d be anxious to have him teach health care policy,” McNeil said, adding that Berwick could be a valuable collaborator for professors interested in researching the structure of Medicare and Medicaid.
Obama announced last week that Marilyn Tavenner, CMS principal deputy administrator, will succeed Berwick as the next CMS chief administrator.
Berwick did not respond to interview requests for this article.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council issued a statement condemning the use of pepper spray on student protesters at the University of California-Davis in a statement released on Sunday November 20.
The statement came two days after a video surfaced on YouTube showing police officers pepper-spraying a group of seated students who were part of the Occupy movement.
The presence of Harvard’s own Occupy movement on campus was the main motivation behind the statement, according to UC Student Initiative Committee Chair Nicholas W. Galat ’13. Although the UC has not taken a stance on any portion of Occupy Harvard’s platform, the statement called for “the continued support of the right of students to peaceful protest without violent response by the Harvard administration.”
“We ultimately were compelled by the fact that there are protests ongoing at Harvard, and that’s what makes them directly relevant to us as students here,” UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said. “The history of violent crackdowns here at Harvard made it even more compelling that we do something now, preemptively, to say that whatever the political views of these protesters are, we support their right to protest nonviolently.”
Ebrahim was primarily referring to the student takeover of University Hall in 1969, when administrators called in city and state police and violence ensued.
However, Ebrahim said that he does not see any immediate danger of history repeating itself.
“I think that the inclination of Harvard police in general is to protect students, not to beat them with batons or spray pepper spray in their faces,” Ebrahim said.
Occupy Harvard member Summer A. Shafer, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, graduated from University of California-Berkeley in 2008 and spoke out against the controversial use of police force at both the Berkeley and Davis campuses.
“I thought it was a complete collapse of responsibility on the part of the campus police,” Shafer said. “It was appalling, and it was something that you never think can happen at your school.”
However, Shafer also said that she thinks the highly-publicized incidents could ultimately be beneficial to the movement.
“It’s one of those events that catalyzes public opinion in favor of the student protests, and so in a way what those students took was kind of a sacrificial stance in order to boost support nationwide around student protests,” Shafer said.
UC-Davis has since announced that the November 18 incidents are under review and has placed the police chief and two officers on administrative leave, according to press releases.
Ebrahim said that he thought it was telling that the UC’s vote on whether to issue the statement was unanimous, with three abstaining.
“It’s very rare that we take a unanimous stance on something like that,” Ebrahim said. “I think it just shows that across all political ideologies and people of all different backgrounds can agree that this incident was really horrifying and shouldn’t ever be repeated at any college campus, at Harvard or anywhere else.”

Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank ’61-'62, one of the most powerful democrats on Capitol Hill, announced yesterday that he would not seek reelection in the House of Representatives in 2012.
Frank said that he felt compelled to choose between “a full-fledged campaign” and “my obligation to my current constituents.”
Though Frank had originally indicated that he would run for another term, election forecasts predicted a difficult reelection due to the redrawing of his district that added 325,000 new constituents and did not include New Bedford, a bedrock of support for the representative.
“It would have been a rough campaign,” Frank said at a press conference in Newton City Hall on Monday.
Frank said that he had long planned to retire in 2014 and felt that his new constituents would be short-changed if he stepped down after only two years as their representative.
“Starting on a series of projects only to be passing them along in various stages of incompletion to a successor two years later is not a responsible way to act,” Frank wrote in a statement.
Frank said that he would like to concentrate on teaching and writing in the coming years.
“I have the longest uncompleted Ph.D. thesis in Harvard history haunting me,” he said.
Many said that they are sorry to learn of Frank’s departure from the political scene.
“We won’t have anyone as bright and effective as Barney in a very long time, if ever,” said Newton resident Barbara A. Gaffin.
Adan Acevedo ’13, president of the Harvard Democrats, echoed these sentiments.
“He’s one of the greatest congressmen we’ve had in recent history because of his devotion to Wall Street reform,” Acevedo said, referring to a bill he co-authored, the Dodd-Frank Act—a historic overhaul of the rules governing Wall Street following the economic meltdown in 2008.
The bill, which was signed into law in 2010, was hailed by President Obama as “the most sweeping financial reform in history.”
Frank has served in Congress for 30 years, having represented Massachusetts’ 4th District for 16 terms since 1981.
Frank is also famous for being the first openly gay member of Congress. He voluntarily came out in 1987, as the gay rights movement began to gain momentum.
“The best antidote to prejudice is reality because prejudice by definition is based on ignorance,” Frank said. “I am proud by my finally coming out—I was 47. It didn’t happen in a clean sweep, but when I volunteered finally to come out in 1987, I do think it was helpful.”
Frank said that though he made plenty of enemies throughout his political career, he has remained committed to his values and ideas.
“I don’t even have to pretend to try to be nice to people I don’t like,” he said.
Supporters said that Frank does not shy away from his opponents and is not afraid to stand up for his beliefs.
“He’s the smartest guy in the room,” said Steve Bartlett, the head of the Financial Services Roundtable, a major Wall Street lobbying group, to the New York Times. “In a debate, you want to be on the same side as Barney, and if you’re not on the same side, you should re-evaluate being in the debate at all.”

Occupy Harvard is gaining support among faculty members as the movement enters its third week.
Almost 30 faculty members in four departments at Harvard signed an open letter last week calling for University President Drew G. Faust to open the gates in Harvard Yard.
“We do not share the perception that the Occupy movement constitutes a threat to Harvard,” the letter states. “To the contrary, we are in sympathy with protests against increasing inequality in the United States and believe that Harvard should welcome discussions of the issue.”
The letter described the move to close the yard as “inconsistent with the University’s commitments to open inquiry and inclusiveness.”
“Closed gates are not just a nuisance; they are symbolically wrong,” said Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures Francesco Erspamer.
Kirkland House Masters Tom C. Conley and Verena A. Conley, as well as faculty in the Department of Comparative Literature, the Department of Linguistics, and the Committee on Degrees in the study of Women, Gender and Sexuality signed the letter.
Many of those who signed also spent Thanksgiving with Occupy Harvard supporters, bringing traditional holiday dishes and discussing the general movement.
Some faculty members, Erspamer said, support the Occupy movement because they fear Harvard is turning into a vocational school and undermining its mission to provide a liberal arts education.
Erspamer said he worries the University is not preparing students for “civil responsibility.”
“Careerism and political apathy are dangerous for the University,” Erspamer added.
Professor Francis X. Clooney of the Harvard Divinity School and Professor Duncan Kennedy of the Law School also submitted letters to Faust, according to Prachi Sanghavi, an Occupy Harvard protester wand a student in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Sanghavi proposed a petition in the movement’s early stages during a general assembly. The petition was then sent to departments asking for faculty support.
Currently 171 faculty members representing ten schools have signed the petition, supporting Occupy Harvard’s goal “to create a more just world,” as stated in the petition.
“It’s been hard because we’re sending emails to people who don’t recognize our names,” said Sanghavi. “We’re imagining that there’s much more faculty support out there.”
Kavi Bhalla, an Occupy Harvard protester and tutor in Pforzheimer House, said that the petition aimed to gain faculty support with hopes of also increasing undergraduate approval. “
When undergraduates realize people they respect support [Occupy Harvard] it may change their hearts and minds,” Bhalla said.
Bhalla, Sanghavi, and Erspamer said that they have not encountered any opposition from other faculty members.
“The faculty that have signed are not your radical faculty,” Sanghavi said. “These are fairly mainstream Harvard faculty.”
Those who sign have the option of submitting public comments to the petition. “
Harvard should join Horton and hear the Whos and stop the Grinches from stealing Christmas,” Economics Professor Richard B. Freeman wrote.

Bahraini newspaper editor Mansoor al-Jamri called for freedom of the press and human rights in Bahrain following the recent release of an independent report that accuses Bahrain’s government of torturing protestors and dissidents earlier this year.
Al-Jamri, who spoke at Harvard Law School on Monday, is the co-founder and editor of Bahrain’s only independent newspaper Al Wasat, which was temporarily shut down by the regime of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.
“The people saw hell,” said al-Jamri, referring to the government crackdown between March and August 2011 in which dozens of Bahrainis were killed and hundreds were imprisoned. The protests arose in a wave of unrest sparked by the Arab Spring movement across the Middle East.
Al-Jamri alleged that the regime targeted his newspaper in particular. According to al-Jamri, armed men vandalized his presses and the government planted false stories in his paper, enabling authorities to later accuse him of inciting Bahrain’s Shiite Muslim majority to rise up against the Sunni royal family.
Al-Jamri said that the violent repression of protests follows a long period of gradual democratic reform in the country.
“Bahrain is a lost opportunity,” he said, citing what he believes was the regime’s failure to work with moderate reformers who want to overcome religious inequality in the kingdom. “People don’t want to be treated as second class citizens, or as first class citizens while others are dying.”
Al-Jamri said he remains ambivalent about Bahrain’s democratic aspirations, but that he maintains he a clear vision for the future of the island nation. “We want a state where every citizen—Christian, Jew, or Muslim—is equal before the law.” Not all the audience members agreed with al-Jamri’s assessment of the situation.
Hadyah Fathalla, a first year MPA at the Kennedy School and a native of Bahrain, said she felt his representation was one-sided.
“He didn’t offer a balanced view,” she said. “In the future, it would be valuable to have a dialogue with someone who disagrees with [al-Jamri’s] views.”
Kennedy School research fellow Noora Lori, also a native of Bahrain, said that the lively debate during the event gave her “a sense of how passionate people are and how invested people are.”
“That says something about the Bahraini people,” she said.

Three Harvard professors gathered to discuss the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, leader of China from 1978 to 1992, and their significance in shaping China’s past and future at a forum at the Institute of Politics on Monday night.
Graham T. Allison Jr., a professor at the Kennedy School, introduced Deng as being largely responsible for the nation’s rapid economic growth—China is now the world’s largest exporter and holder of foreign reserves.
“The dramatic rise of China is the most significant geo-political development in the last quarter century and is likely to be the most significant geo-political development in the century to come,” Allison said, identifying Deng as the main initiator of this rise.
Deng’s small stature did not correlate with his leadership ability, argued Ezra F. Vogel, an emeritus Harvard professor and author of “Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China.”
“He doesn’t look like he has any kind of inferiority complex,” Vogel said while standing in front of a picture of Deng, who was five feet tall.
“I think what’s great about Deng is that he was the political manager,” Vogel said.
Vogel referred to his Deng’s leadership, which he characterized as exemplary, in de-collectivization and distancing China from Maoism.
Vogel identified five areas that helped Deng set the pattern of reform: regularization of political and social conditions, moves towards a meritocracy, leadership teams for regions of the country, openness in international affairs, and limiting military expenses. He noted these still play an important role for modern Chinese policy.
“He had a very important influence in shaping China today,” he said.
Despite Deng’s achievements, his image as a reformer may not be completely accurate, argued Anthony Saich, a Kennedy School professor.
“He could be just as ruthless as Mao,” Saich said, noting that the two leaders had similar upbringings and revolutionary influences.
Saich also recognized Deng’s role in causing inflation in China and his protection of party privileges, which continue to plague modern day China.
Though he acknowledged these flaws, Saich noted Deng’s influence on the party. “In some ways, Xiaoping was a collective figurehead for China’s leadership,” he said.
Students said the forum helped them recognize Deng’s impact on China and its relevance for modern Chinese affairs.
“I think this forum really highlighted the legacy of Deng Xiaoping on modern China,” said Sietse K. Goffard ’15, “It especially highlighted how his influence on China was crucial not only in decades past but will also influence future decades to come, especially with regards to US relations.”

White House Executive Pastry Chef Bill Yosses passed out fast-dissolving breath strips labelled with flavors like “Regret” and “Mommy” at his Monday lecture, “Lip Smackin’ Science: Crystals, Emulsions, Foams, and Pink Vanilla Cupcakes.”
Yosses used the strips to emphasize the importance of taste in cooking—even when experimenting with the techniques of molecular gastronomy.
“Taste is the standard that we will always go back to,” he said.
Najat Kaanache, a Spanish-born chef, joined Yosses for the presentation.
The two met while Kaanache was studying at Ferran Adrià’s Spanish concept restaurant El Bulli.
During the presentation Yosses and Kaanache created several experimental dishes, including a grape sorbet frozen with liquid nitrogen and a chocolate mousse made from an emulsion of chocolate and water.
The chefs provided the crowd with samples of olives that had undergone “spherification,” a modernist cuisine technique in which a chemical process renders food into a sphere that resembles caviar.
In his post at the White House, Yosses is responsible for overseeing the management and preparation of all pastries and desserts served at White House functions, from formal dinners to the first family’s private meals.
Yosses said that the Obama family received his experimental cooking warmly, but that foams do not often find their way onto the dessert menu at State Dinners.
“This wouldn’t be appropriate for 90 percent of the guests who come to the White House,” Yosses said. “They’re looking for more traditional tastes.”
“Because this kind of modern cuisine is so visually different from what people are used to, I think people are uncomfortable with it.” Yosses said. “But I think it’s going to influence chefs for years to come.”
Yosses’ visit comes as a part of the lecture series inspired by the General Education course “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter.”
The “Science and Cooking” class aims to teach students about the properties of matter through lectures and labs that focus on “molecular gastronomy.”

Harvard students were given 90 seconds to pitch their start-up ideas to a panel of five judges on Monday to win $1,000 at the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum Elevator Pitch Competition.
Yi Han ’13 beat out almost thirty other students with his start-up, Clarendon Media, which plans to bring digital advertising to taxis.
“Introducing this new business model lowers the barrier to entry in the advertising space for local businesses,” Han said.
“Whereas with traditional taxi rooftop advertising, businesses would have to pay about $150 a month, our model creates an opportunity for businesses with much smaller budgets,” he continued.
With this service, businesses would be able to reserve advertising rights for specific times of day, Han said.
A nightclub, for example, could choose to advertise only during Friday and Saturday nights, instead of paying for an entire month of advertising.
Han said he plans to use the prize money to rent digital displays and pay local taxi drivers to install them.
He credited Tuan A. Ho ’09, a non-resident entrepreneurship tutor in Quincy House, for helping him come up with the idea.
The runner-up pitches were from U.S. Green Data, a website that aggregates information about incentives for buying energy-efficient appliances, and Global Village Fruits, a business that distributes jackfruit according to fair trade policies.
“HCEF fosters entrepreneurship among students, and we see the Elevator Pitch as a first step to turning the idea into a reality,” said Gabriel Wildberger, a visiting undergraduate and a Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum officer.
Andrew J. Magliozzi ’05, who served on the panel of judges, has founded two businesses since graduating from Harvard, Veritas Tutors and Finalsclub.org.
“There wasn’t much of an entrepreneurial culture when I was here, but now it’s really blossomed,” he said.
The panel also included Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor at the Harvard Business School in entrepreneurial management.
“The biggest purpose here is to get together people from the community, and they did a great job with that,” he said.
The Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum also focuses on networking and regular speaking events.
“Our goal is to become the paramount society for every single sector of entrepreneurship across the Harvard campus,” said co-president Patrick M. Colangelo ’14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Occupy Harvard went head-to-head with Wall Street on Monday when protesters attempted to interrupt a Goldman Sachs recruiting event hosted by the Office of Career Services.
Nearly three weeks after protesters descended upon Harvard Yard to set up the Occupy Harvard camp, the group joined forces with Occupy Boston and other local students in a “Rally to Defend Freedom of Speech” on Monday afternoon, which eventually led to a confrontation with OCS.
About half of the 50 protesters broke off from the rally to visit a Goldman Sachs recruiting session, held at the On-Campus Interview Facility on Mass Ave.
Jasper N. Henderson ’12, an Occupy Harvard member and rally organizer, said on his way to the event that he was going to ask the recruiters “why [investors at Goldman Sachs] make so much money.”
When the group reached the OCS offices, ralliers stood outside the building for a few minutes, yelling, “Goldman Sachs, you can’t hide. We can see your greedy side.”
When two protesters attempted to enter the building using their Harvard IDs, they were denied entrance by HUPD officers and OCS officials stationed outside.
Officials told the students that they were not allowed to enter because the event had already begun, according to Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, an Occupy Harvard organizer and a member of the Crimson editorial board.
When the protesters witnessed other students being granted entrance, they asked OCS Director Robin E. Mount—who was among the officials stationed outside the building—why they had not been permitted to enter.
“What [Mount] told me was that she didn’t want me to disrupt the event,” Korn said. “She said no, you’re not wearing the right clothes, you don’t have a resume with you. And I said, ‘If I come back wearing the right clothes, with a resume with me, will you let me in?’ And she said no and turned [her head away from me].”
“I think if I had gone wearing a suit and looking like the one percent they would have let me in,” she added, referencing the Occupy movement’s popular “one percent” mantra.
As ralliers began to dissipate, Mount told the remaining protesters that she respected the movement and the protesters’ right to free speech but she also respected “the other students’ right to look for a job if they want it.”
Mount declined to comment.
The protest began as a show of solidarity for the Occupy movements at the University of California at Davis and the University of California at Berkeley. Davis and Berkeley have attracted media attention after Davis campus police pepper sprayed student protesters and Berkeley police officers in riot gear used billy clubs and physical force to break up student protests.
The Harvard movement has largely focused on internal University issues, such as the custodian union’s contract and socially responsible investing. But Monday’s protest—which took place outside Harvard Yard near the Science Center so that non-Harvard affiliates could join—refocused on national politics and the broader Occupy movement.
“A lot of people are talking about how we are a college campus, [and] there are college campuses across the country where students are being pepper sprayed by the campus police,” said Korn. “We’ve been asking for HUPD to make a statement saying that they wouldn’t pepper spray us, and they haven’t done that yet.”
In usual Occupy fashion, ralliers used the group “mic check” to voice their concerns about police brutality at Davis and Berkeley, the University’s decision to restrict entrance to the Yard to Harvard ID holders, and government limitations on free speech.
After the mic check, Korn rallied protesters to march around the perimeter of Harvard Yard. The swarm of protesters chanted “show me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like” as they marched.
Chris Hedges, a Pulitzer Prize journalist and graduate of the Divinity School, spoke to protesters outside the Science Center and shared his opinions on the Occupy movement.
In his speech, Hedges stressed the importance of the liberal arts education and expressed concerns about the increasing focus on science and technical fields at Harvard, saying that Harvard has begun to transform into “a giant sort of engineering school with a few liberal arts courses.”
“I find that distressing,” Hedges said afterward on his way to a panel that would discuss his new book, “The Death of Liberalism.” “But that’s certainly the direction of the University and [the administrators’] response has been to isolate and shut down the movement as much as possible to avoid a public relations disaster.”
After Hedges concluded his speech, protesters quietly disbanded, many walking back to the Occupy Harvard encampment after flashing their IDs to guards at the gates to the Yard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little less than a year ago, my friend and former teammate Kate Morris wrote an editorial piece for The Crimson entitled “A New Conversation” in response to the odd and upsetting instance in which urine spilled on a bunch of LBGTQ books in Lamont Library—an incident which was declared to be an “accident” by Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds. Kate chose not to focus on the incident but rather to look at what she saw as the larger issues at play. Most profound to me was her conclusion that “common human dignity” was more important than social spaces and funding which would allow her to be “separate and unequal.”
I don’t feel it’s my place to comment on the purposes these resources could serve. I’ve been lucky enough not to deal with stigma in my life, so I can’t speak for those who have.
But I have an enormous respect for anyone who is brave enough to write such a personal piece and for anyone who has been brave enough to “come out,” whether to the public or only to their closest friends. And I agree that dignity and respect are the most important pieces in the fight against prejudice.
I always considered my high school to be impressively open-minded, but I think we owe a great deal of that to a young woman named Liz Guenther. I was lucky enough to get to know her in the spring of my freshman year while playing with her on the varsity lacrosse team. A phenomenal athlete, Guenther captained the soccer, hockey, and lacrosse teams and was extremely outspoken about her own experiences with homophobia. That I played lacrosse with her for only three months and consider her to have a great impact on how I think about LGBTQ issues speaks to how influential a person she was, and I have no doubts that she has continued to inspire her friends and colleagues to this day.
The fact remains, however, that not everyone is as brave as Liz or Kate, and it’s pretty unfair to expect them to be.
Instead, we, the straight “allies,” should be the ones taking the step forward to say “Yes, we support and respect you.”
Here at Harvard, some of the best examples of this allied support have come from athletes.
For example, when I was a freshman, a few of my teammates and I attended a discussion called “Queerness in Athletics,” in which four “queer” athletes and one “ally” discussed their experiences. Since we had been at a team function, the discussion was almost over by the time we got there, so I never heard whether or not the ally panelist had any personal connection to the issue. But I do remember his claim that while there weren’t any openly gay athletes on his team, he couldn’t imagine his teammates hating anyone. I don’t think that event ever got much publicity, but I don’t think this pledge of a team’s support should be forgotten.
I was impressed by the panelists, but I also saw how uncomfortable some of the athletes were.
Clearly, as allies, we need to be more vocal in our support of our classmates.
An outstanding instance of this support came this fall when the entire wrestling team decided to come out as allies on National Coming Out Day. While standing outside of the Malkin Athletic Center, the young men wore T-shirts with messages such as “Some dudes marry dudes. Get over it.” That show of solidarity received plenty of well-deserved publicity, and I certainly hope it encouraged other members of the campus to voice their support.
We also shouldn’t forget the actions that occur on a smaller scale, from campus-wide posting of Facebook statuses to the wearing of rainbow-colored pins.
So I guess this column is my 700-word declaration of support. I recognize that I haven’t exactly been an activist. I certainly don’t consider this column to be anything brave or ground-breaking. But I also feel that every word counts, that every ounce of kindness has a positive impact that may not always be seen.
So a year after Kate called for dignity, I am doing my best to answer with a showing of respect. It may not be much, but if it makes even one person feel more comfortable in his or her skin, then I’ve done my job.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a month ago, Louis Leblanc finally made his professional hockey debut. And as far as debuts go, his could not have gone much better.
In his first career appearance, Leblanc had two assists and the overtime game-winning goal, propelling the Hamilton Bulldogs over the Rochester Americans, 3-2, in the American Hockey League (AHL).
Just two years earlier, Leblanc, then a Harvard freshman, made his first collegiate debut. In another memorable performance, the rookie scored one and picked up an assist in the Crimson’s opening 5-3 win over Dartmouth.
In the past four years, Leblanc has had to make four of these debuts in four different leagues—the United States Hockey League, the ECAC, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and the AHL—and has succeeded so far at every step.
“It’s been great to far,” Leblanc said. “It’s been an adjusting period ... I’m excited. This is another step in my hockey career, and the next step is the NHL. It’s a big learning process for me this year.”
And he is not far away from making one final debut. Late Monday night, Leblanc was called up by the Montreal Canadiens after forward Max Pacioretty was suspended for three games.
This NHL debut will be even more special for Leblanc, as it will be for his hometown team.
“[I’ve] always been watching them since ever I can remember watching hockey,” he said. “So it’s [been] an honor just looking forward to making the big team.”
His road to professional hockey was not always so clear.
Two summers ago, Leblanc had to make one of the most difficult decisions of his life. He could either remain at Harvard—he was the team’s top scorer and was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in the 2009-2010 season—or he could leave Cambridge and play for the Montreal Juniors.
Ultimately, Leblanc chose to leave Harvard for amateur play in the QMJHL, thinking it would give him the best shot at making the Canadian World Juniors team.
“It was a really tough decision leaving,” Leblanc said. “But I don’t regret my choices, and I just look forward from here.
“I loved my first year at Harvard,” Leblanc added. “Everything about it was great, schooling-wise and hockey-wise.”
He was a huge asset for Harvard’s offense, leading the team with 11 goals and 23 points. The former member of the class of 2013 was also second on the team with 12 assists and named a finalist for the ECAC Rookie of the Year.
He made an impression in only a year at the school, and his teammates and coaches commented that his importance to the team extended beyond his contributions on the ice.
“Louis’s a good teammate,” said junior forward Conor Morrison, who was a freshman with Leblanc two years ago. “You always knew what you were going get from him. He was always going to work super hard [and] give 100 percent every shift.”
Leblanc still keeps in touch with many of his former Crimson teammates, and even texted Harvard coach Ted Donato to wish him well before the opening game of the season this year.
“During his time here, he had his mind set on competing for Harvard and going to school here,” said junior forward Alex Fallstrom, who also played as a freshman alongside Leblanc. “He did everything in his power to contribute to the team and wasn’t thinking too much of the future.”
He surprised many of his teammates and coaches when he decided to leave the Crimson during the summer after his freshman year, including Donato.
“I don’t think it was a rushed decision ... even though looking at it now, I would say I strongly disagree with it,” Donato said. “There’s always a number of factors, but ultimately [I believe] his agent had the largest say in it.”
Hockey-wise, Donato believed that playing major juniors back in Canada against younger players was a step down from the Ivy League, ECAC, and the NCAA. But Donato’s main concerns were Leblanc’s development off the ice and the increased risk of injury.
“The NHL team he’s drafted by [is] less interested in his developments as a person fully than they are as a hockey player,” he said. “I think that coming back would have been a great thing for him.”
Leblanc said that Donato, who had a lengthy NHL career himself, advised him on the nature of pro hockey and its tough atmosphere.
“He taught me to stay composed,” Leblanc said. “There’s a lot of ups and downs [in professional hockey].  It’s a rough business, [so he told me] to be ready and look out for yourself because everyone wants a piece of you.”
Since the QMJHL and professionals play many more games than the Crimson does, Donato believed this would hinder Leblanc’s physical development as well. With a higher risk of injury, the Harvard coach was worried that Leblanc would have to focus more energy on recovery and less on maturing, putting on weight, and growing stronger.
And sure enough, Leblanc has been banged up after Harvard, as he underwent shoulder surgery last summer.
But this hasn’t hindered his success. In 14 games with Hamilton, he already has four goals and six assists, and the parent club noticed. After only a month of professional experience, the Habs called him up to the NHL.
Though Donato disagrees with Leblanc’s decision to leave the Crimson, he added that Leblanc remains a part of the Harvard hockey family. Still, with the skills that Leblanc brings, the Crimson may have had more success on the ice.
“I think there’s always a part of me that goes to bed and says what if, what if Louis were here tonight?” Donato said. “But at the end of the day, we really wish him well and will always be supportive of him.”
Leblanc will suit up with the Canadiens for the first time and looks to make his final hockey debut in Anaheim against the Ducks on Wednesday.
“I’m enjoying what I do,” Leblanc said. “I love hockey, and I want to play hockey for the next 20 years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the final buzzer sounded during its 59-49 defeat of Central Florida in the championship game of this weekend’s Battle 4 Atlantis tournament, the entire Crimson roster gathered at center court for post-game celebrations.
In the moments leading up to the announcement of the tournament MVP, several of his teammates grinned and pointed towards junior point guard Brandyn Curry. Though the accolade went to co-captain Keith Wright, the message was clear.
“Keith and other players have been dubbed as Most Valuable or other awards, but I’m not sure there’s a more important player to our team than Brandyn,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Thanksgiving trip to Paradise Island, Bahamas, was more business than pleasure for the Crimson (6-0), as the tournament’s eight-team field included then-No. 4 Connecticut and then-No. 22 Florida State.
While most had expected the two ranked teams to meet in Saturday’s final, it was ultimately Harvard that won three games in three days to return to Cambridge as champions of the first-ever Battle 4 Atlantis.
“Going into [the tournament], I don’t know how many people thought we could do it, but we certainly thought we could go in and win this,” Curry said. “I’m just happy that our hard work paid off and that people are starting to see that we are for real.”
None of which could have happened without Curry, the 6’1 maestro of Harvard’s offensive juggernaut.
“[Being a playmaker] is kind of his calling card,” junior forward Kyle Casey said. “He has the ball in his hands a lot.  We really rely on him to create for us, and we play off of him, and he does a great job of that. He really embraces his role.”
“That’s my job–being the playmaker,” Curry added. “With all these great players we have on our team ... I’ve got to put them in the right position and get them the ball in the spots they like, so they can make the shots they do.”
Curry currently leads the team with 22 assists, but he’s not only a distributor.
In its opening round matchup with Utah Thursday, the Crimson crushed the Utes, 75-45, with some early help from Curry, who scored seven of Harvard’s first 11 points.
His main focus with Utah was neutralizing its leading scorer, senior Josh “Jiggy” Watkins.
“From the start, I was being very aggressive on defense and just trying to make it difficult for him,” Curry said.
Watkins, who went into the contest averaging 21 points a game, missed his first five shots and finished with 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting along with five turnovers. Curry ended the game with nine points, three assists, and a steal.
Harvard advanced to face its toughest foe in Saturday’s semifinals: the No. 22 Seminoles, which hadn’t lost since falling in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament in March.
When his team needed it the most, Curry proceeded to turn in his best all-around performance. The junior point guard totaled six points, five assists, and five steals, helping force Florida State into 16 turnovers.
“His stat line can’t really show what he does on defense,” Rivard said. “Oftentimes he won’t get the assist, but he’s the one who made the play—someone else had just made an extra pass. I would say he’s the unsung hero.”
Curry was especially crucial in the game’s final minute, hitting a three-pointer to end an 8-3 Seminoles run.
“That was a big shot because if he missed it, they had a chance to get really close,” said Rivard, who passed up a shot of his own to find Curry in the corner.
“The pass by Laurent and shot by Brandyn arguably could be two of the bigger plays for Harvard basketball of all time,” Amaker said. “That moment there was huge, and Brandyn has been in the middle of everything.”
True to form, Curry cemented the 46-41 victory by coming up with a steal and draining a pair of free throws with less than 45 seconds left.
Central Florida had upset the defending national champion Huskies earlier in the day, setting up a Knights-Crimson final.
Curry again showed off his all-around game, collecting six points, three rebounds, two assists, and one steal.
This time his defensive assignment turned out to be Michael Jordan’s youngest son, Marcus Jordan, the Knights’ second-leading scorer. Jordan finished with 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting and missed all five three-pointers he attempted.
“All in all, I thought he was the best defensive player this week,” Casey added.
With Harvard continuing to make a name for itself—the Crimson received 101 votes in the Associated Press Top 25 poll and 61 votes in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll released Monday—Curry’s inspired play on both ends of the floor will be more important ever.
“We go as far as he takes us,” Casey said.

Avid readers of I Saw You Harvard may have heard of Crimson Cocks (Warning: NSFW), a  tumblr featuring reader-submitted photos of Harvard men and their junk. After contacting the founder via the "Ask Me Anything" section of the tumblr, we scored an exclusive Yahoo-chat interview with the third-year Harvard student behind the blog.
Flyby:  How did you come up with the idea for Crimson Cocks?
CC: It started when a friend of mine showed me Obiecocks, and I thought the men of Harvard seemed to have more to offer!
Flyby: So how do the men of Harvard compare?
CC: Well that's the funny thing. I honestly believe the guys at Harvard tend to be….um, larger than average.
Flyby: Really?
CC: Well not all of them lol.
…
Flyby: In your opinion, is bigger always better?
CC: No I don't think so. Honestly, if a guy is really hot or cool or smart, I don't even care.
CC: But if it's just a fun, fleeting hook up and he's got a hot body, then it's really fun if you take off the boxers and find an impressive…
…
Flyby: Is the profile picture on the tumblr of you?
CC: Part of me.
Flyby: Have you told any of your friends that you're the one behind Crimson Cocks?
CC: Um so far no—but one person may have guessed haha.
…
Flyby: Do you want the blog to go viral?
CC: I guess if it gets more attention we might see more men of Harvard.
CC: I think it's not quite fair since guys sort of know how large a woman's breasts are, but you really have no idea about a boy and his pecker.
Flyby: So do you see your blog as a feminist statement?
CC: A little bit, but let's not be grandiose.
CC: It's a bit surprising that some very confident guys get really frightened of this subject.
…
Flyby: Which is your favorite picture?
CC: Haha
CC: Blushing
CC: Yeah I can't pick just one. Various penises give various sorts of pleasure, don't you know.
…
Flyby: What piece of advice would you give to someone looking for a great Crimson Cock?
CC: I actually think it's the overall guy that matters.
CC: Even though physical attributes can be fun.
Flyby: Anything else you would like to add?
CC: Let's tell the men of Harvard to have no fear. They should be pioneers in the future of sexual liberation!

Waiting in line for that double expresso for the third time in one day can get you thinking. Can all this coffee really be healthy? Well, Harvard researchers have your back: according to various studies, the answer seems to be yes.
One study, done by researchers at the School of Public Health, shows that coffee may decrease your risk of endometrial cancer, while another suggests that drinking coffee may reduce the risk of developing prostate cancer. Additionally, a study published in the Harvard Women's Health Watch found that regular coffee drinking lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, discourages the development of colon cancer, reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease, and may reduce the risk of developing gallstones.
However, the research doesn't stop there, as Harvard findings are also debunking old coffee-related myths. One study published in the Harvard Health Letter suggests that coffee may not actually cause increased blood pressure as once thought. The notion that drinking coffee is often followed by a "coffee crash," which makes drinkers sleepy and ill-tempered, is refuted by another Harvard study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine that found that coffee cuts the risk of depression in women.
Despite these seemingly glowing results, the studies should be taken with a grain of salt: while most of them emphasize the benefits of drinking coffee, they also list a series of side effects. These include everything from insomnia (surprised?) to anxiety and irritability.
Next time you dish out four bucks for a cup of the finest brew Cambridge has to offer, think of it, if you like, as an investment for your health.

Are you looking for an easy way to tackle those end-of-the-semester group projects? Podio, an online work platform where people can create "collaboration workspaces" for group projects, is now free of charge to university students worldwide.
Podio brings together all of the tools needed for a collaborative project and helps eliminate the perennial problem of lengthy email chains and documents scattered across several platforms.
Podio has hundreds of specialized work apps to choose from, and users can even create their own. According to Alex E. Amis '15, who started using the platform earlier this year, Podio "has a huge potential to lead to increased productivity and organization among groups."
"You can assign tasks to other group members and schedule meetings," Amis said. "I think it will catch on at Harvard because all of the tools on the website are easy to use."
Each user has their own customizable profile, and stays updated on group progress with the "activity stream," a function that works much like Facebook's newsfeed.
Podio aims to represent a "new way of working; no more bottlenecks, no more blind spots and no more disconnected processes," according to the website.
We're not sure, but this platform may help with those soon-to-be-due group projects and papers.
