After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the several weeks leading up to the end of the semester, students worrying about their final exams and papers were faced with yet another bother: persistent nagging. E-mails from the Registrar continually reminded students that on top of their other responsibilities, they were expected to evaluate their courses for next year's Q Guide. While the administration may be correct in that too many students are neglecting to fill out their evaluations, the Q Guide has also room to improve.
The general design of the guide, which has remained largely the same for several years, could be greatly improved with some crucial changes. First, the system of course evaluations is flawed, potentially resulting in misleading ratings. Some of the questions are redundant or not applicable for many courses and could be easily omitted on a course-by-course basis, but often are not. The rating rubric itself—in which a score of 2, the second-lowest grade, is labeled "Fair"—is far too superlative and causes confusion. The ratings would also be more useful if they were based in a more broad and precise scoring system, from 1 to 10, for example. This would be likely to provide a more honest picture of a course.
Furthermore, this year's online Q Guide is poorly designed and hard to use. The list of course names one is expected to navigate shows only the numbers, not the titles, of courses—a baffling departure from previous years. There are also no links to navigate from one course to the next without returning to the main menu, making browsing all of the courses in a department tedious.
The guide is rendered less effective by a lack of integration with the my.harvard.edu course shopping tool—for example, there is no way to get from a Q Guide entry to a course website. Incorporating the Q Guide entirely into the shopping tool could make course ratings more visible and, in turn, make shopping less tedious. The lack of certain other functionalities, such as the ability to search and rank by ratings, is also a common frustration—evidenced by the abundance of student-designed search engines and spreadsheets developed to make finding courses that fit a certain specification easier. If a student in CS 50 is capable of creating a better search engine for the Q guide, surely the Harvard administration could do so as well.
Fortunately, the Q Guide administrators are currently considering many of these changes, and we hope to see these implemented as soon as possible. It is true, however, that reforms will have little effect if not enough students fill out their course evaluations. One effective way that professors and teaching fellows have encouraged evaluations is to send more personalized e-mails to their students and to tailor evaluation questions to their specific classes. This can make students’ lives easier and shows them the real stake that faculty have in evaluations. The best solution, however, would be for the administration to give students real incentives to turn in their evaluations. Withholding grades until students finish their evaluations would be an excellent way of ensuring that few classes see insufficient response rates.
The Q Guide is a valuable institution that only works when students, faculty, and administrators are all committed to its success. If those who control the format and structure of the guide make the necessary changes, students will surely respond with an increased enthusiasm for completing their course evaluations.

It is with great sadness that we mark the closing of Brandeis University’s Rose Art Museum and the general cuts in education that this loss symbolizes. The Rose, home to Brandeis’s 6,000-object art collection, was approaching its 50th anniversary, but may not make it to that milestone. On Monday, the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to close the museum and use its collection—worth an estimated $350 million—in order to generate funds to cover the University’s looming multimillion-dollar budget deficit. While the plan has been met with considerable opposition from several long-time donors to the Rose and from student protests, the University is moving forward undeterred. Brandeis’s president recently said that some of the art may be saved from liquidation, but that there was no doubt that the facility would be dismantled.  

The Rose Art Museum currently welcomes 13,000 to 15,000 people through its doors per year, and provides opportunities for students, teachers and the public to see and learn about the arts. Through student internships, class visits and artist talks, the Rose fulfills its mission statement to “stimulate public awareness and disseminate knowledge of modern and contemporary art to enrich educational, cultural, and artistic communities regionally, nationally and internationally.” According to the chair of the Rose’s board of overseers, the collection is Brandeis University’s largest asset. Unfortunately that may have led to its ultimate downfall as the University searched for answers after seeing its endowment fall from $712 million to $549 million.
Brandeis's decision to sell its art collection in order to make ends meet is all too indicative of the larger problems facing universities as donations dry up and endowments plummet in this dismal economic climate. On average, university endowments have dropped 23 percent in only five months. 

It is sad to see the Rose, and all the other programs that may follow it, disappear as universities seek new ways of generating funds. oArt is an essential component of the breadth of the liberal arts education and should not be sacrificed casually. While it may sound sentimental, difficult times are when we need art the most. We hope that universities in the surrounding area can do their best to offer Brandeis students access to art resources. Universities should band together to weather the storm of trying financial times.

People expect a lot from science—that it will eradicate disease, put us in contact with aliens, create robots that do our laundry—but the claims sometimes border on extravagant. In a New York Times essay this week, Dennis Overbye continues this trend by arguing that science (what he calls the “most successful human activity of all time”) elevates democracy. Because science does not purport to provide ethical guidance, he says, it transcends the divisions of culture and creed to bring people together.
Many may argue that Overbye is flawed in his portrayal of science as a beacon of objective truth. Certainly, a large part of the aura around “Science” is derived from its perception as merely a series of impartial discoveries. But Overbye’s deeper premise—that science must separate itself from the metaphysical—too often goes unquestioned. If scientists truly follow the principles of openness their method espouses, they cannot rule out the possibility of a purpose behind the process.
In that sense, the greatest strength of science is also its greatest weakness. Science advances through perpetual disagreement and revision; scientists establish rigorous methods and standards to work toward the achievement of truth, and never seek to predict outcomes unconditionally. These practices allow for the exhilaration of unexpected discoveries. But it comes with a caveat: When the scientific method is turned inward to examine its own premises, it becomes destabilized. An ideological breach opens, in which, theoretically, a God or ethics could exist.
Indeed, for all the innovations it has engendered, the very goal of science remains unknown. What will happen when we learn all there is to know about the natural world? It’s possible that reaching that stage will destroy our humanity, causing us to march inexorably toward an uncontrollable determinism. According to this view, once we are fully cognizant of our biology, our thoughts and desires can be predicted, and therefore no longer belong to us. We will not fall in love, but rather possess a body in which environmental stimuli allow the activation and repression of certain genes, leading to the release of hormones that produce perceived feelings.

But the alternate scenario is also possible: that upon exhausting the natural world, science has the ability to someday reveal hitherto unfamiliar regions of metaphysics. Consider, for example, the explosion in understanding of the cell, the fundamental unit of life. The expanding field of systems biology elucidates breathtaking networks of interactions, as thousands upon thousands of molecules are precisely regulated to perform the simplest of functions. Metaphysically, many explanations could exist for the arguably beautiful nature of these networks.

And the principle naturally extends beyond biology. While science owes its success to its rigorous methods, the search for truth is much more than a process. There is an end truth to be sought. Indeed, while Einstein may have been right to contend that “I have never obtained any ethical values from my scientific work,” it must be remembered that then, as now, science was incomplete. 

Scientists may now lack the means to provide metaphysical answers to humanity’s deepest questions, but the values it espouses leave open the possibility that one day, these answers may be attainable. Overbye and others are right to praise science, but they do so for the wrong reasons. It is unduly pessimistic—as well as unsound methodologically—to assume that science can or should be separated from the religious, the metaphysical, or the ethical. After all, no good scientist should reject a hypothesis before it is tested.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On New Year’s Day in Oakland, a bullet seared through the back of unarmed 22-year-old Oscar Grant III, point-blank out of the barrel of an officer sworn to serve and protect. Mr. Grant died instantly, prostrate in the universal “I Surrender” position, the officer’s knee smashing his neck into cement. Police supporters claim that Grant was harassing another train passenger. Supposedly the officer who fired the shot thought he was using a taser. 
But the situation didn’t call for a firearm of any kind, and neither claim can justify the cold-blooded murder. More importantly, the execution of Oscar Grant is not an isolated incident. It is one slice out of a contemporary history of racism against minorities by law enforcement officers. Systemic racism is as American as apple pie. 
Perhaps it was some kind of accident, but those who frame the incident as isolated ignore the bigger picture. Citizens should ask what causes a cop—not in jeopardy of his own life—to make that split-second decision to fire. The general mentality of police regarding crime fighting, distrust within communities, and a culture of fear across the nation regarding minority males should be factored in. Racism in law enforcement is an ugly reality and most people, especially supposedly sympathetic liberals, shield their eyes from it. We do not live in an impartial system marred by a few occasional sound bites worth of errors in judgment. We are far from a color-blind Canaan flowing with milk and honey.
Since 9/11, most statistics on race and police reports have been made exempt from public disclosure. The last available large-scale study was a 1999 Bureau of Justice Statistics report: “Use of Force By Police: Overview of National and Local Data.” This comparative study of arrests in Miami-Dade County and Eugene, Oregon, found that in all use-of-force incidents in which the officers used a chemical agent, baton, gun, or other special weapons, 57 percent of the suspects were black, 28 percent were Latino, and only 15 percent were white. More recent studies by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) also found that blacks and Latinos suffer much more from excessive force than whites. 

In a system of checks and balances, there is limited oversight over the only body authorized to exercise lethal force upon citizens. In a study by the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Northwestern University sociologist Wesley Skogan notes that decentralization and officer discretion have been the trends of police organization over the last eight years. Sixty percent of officers admit to not reporting serious abuse of authority by their colleagues: little can break the “Blue Code of Silence.” Unfortunately, officers are not just blue, but black, brown, white, yellow, and red. So who challenges abuse when the colors don’t paint a pretty picture? Legislation like the California Peace Officer’s Bill of Rights seals records against public scrutiny. 

This lack of oversight juxtaposes a high number of abuses over the years, many of which have been forgotten. In 1994, 29-year-old Anthony Báez was strangled by an NYPD officer after refusing to leave the street in front of his home where he was playing football with his little brother. In June 2007, Michael Tarif and Evelyn Warren, human rights attorneys, were themselves assaulted when they attempted to help a young black man who was being beaten by the cops. Oscar Grant’s murder is part of a long history that calls far higher degree of accountability. 

History has created a culture of distrust between communities and cops. The response to the shooting revives the sentiments of almost 40 years ago, when the Black Panther Party was founded in Oakland to defend against police brutality. Many minorities—especially black males—are raised to be completely submissive to police officers, not out of respect for authority, but for fear of their lives. Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates notes: “If you wonder why blacks seem particularly susceptible to ‘rumors’ and ‘conspiracy theories,’ you might take a look at a history in which the official story was a poor guide to anything that mattered much, and in which rumor sometimes verged on the truth...as ‘older blacks like to repeat,’ when ‘white folks say “justice,” they mean ‘just us.’” 

This is not a simplistic “us versus them” situation. If disadvantaged minority communities are to make headway, they must fight internal crime, testify against murderers and drug dealers, and collaborate on neighborhood security, including forming organizations to monitor both street gangs and police behavior. But just as minority communities cannot pin everything on the system, police departments must stop perpetuating the idea that they are the “thin blue line” between all that is good and evil. Police must be subject to more substantial review by federal agencies such as the FBI, and police unions must allow administrators to question accused officers. Crime-fighting is only one part of a multifaceted job: Community crime prevention and defense of individual liberties are also part of the contract. 

The murder of Oscar Grant is only one piece of a history of systemic racism by law enforcement. Moreover, it is important to realize that many people in this country still routinely combat crime, illiteracy, poverty, and despair on a daily basis. In an era in which a black president is a sign of hope but not a sign of deliverance, we must not discard the politics of emancipation.

To the editors:As the Crimson noted, the idea of Score Choice is hardly new. ACT already has such an option, and the College Board allowed it for nearly a decade for its Subject Tests. Score Choice rests on the same principle that has supported our admissions process for decades—that applicants should be free to present their own best case. We have always counted an applicant’s highest test scores and have allowed students to decide whether they wanted to send all their test scores. The new Score Choice policy aligns well with our belief that the individual student owns his or her test scores and is entitled to direct their use. That same belief in the importance of the individual applicant’s freedom—and responsibility—to choose how best to make the case for admission underlies our long-standing invitation to submit essays, CDs, academic or creative projects, or anything else that best represents academic, extracurricular, and personal accomplishments. We seek to bring to Harvard students with the maturity and independent -mindedness to exercise choice responsibly. Students can take tests knowing they will be able to choose which ones to send to colleges. The fact that test results will not automatically be part of the permanent record may also help to alleviate some of the stress that pervades the college admissions process and distorts the junior and senior years of high school. Standardized tests are only one factor among many in Harvard’s holistic admissions process. The Committee on Admissions has always taken into account the fact that test scores can be affected by such factors as schooling, intensive test preparation, and socioeconomic background. We have long been aware that the test-taking experience of students may be affected by their financial and educational resources. In particular, we recognize that students from modest economic backgrounds have a limited number of fee waivers for tests and may not be able to take them as many times as affluent students. We also know that research clearly indicates that score increases are generally modest after two test sittings. We will continue to review each applicant carefully with all these factors in mind. WILLIAM R. FITZSIMMONS ’67 and MARILYN E. McGRATH ’70Cambridge, Mass.Jan. 14, 2009 William R. Fitzsimmons is the Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid for Harvard College. Marilyn McGrath is the Director of Admissions for Harvard College.

To the editors:
I would like to thank Dean Dingman for continuing to increase food literacy among Harvard students—particularly when it comes to vegetarian cuisine. A recent survey by Aramark, a leading food service provider, concluded that nearly a quarter of college students are actively seeking vegan options when they sit down to eat, for reasons ranging from their own health to environmental concerns to of course cruelty to animals. As such, it’s more important than ever for HUDS to meet this growing demand for creative and cruelty-free meals.
As students become more educated about the routine suffering animals face when raised and killed for food, it’s understandable why they are seeking meatless alternatives in droves. For example, chickens on factory farms have their beaks sliced off with hot blades, and many are even scalded alive in feather removal tanks. If these kinds of abuses were inflicted upon cats or dogs, it would result in felony cruelty to animals charges.
Thankfully, there’s never been a better time to expand the vegetarian and vegan options on campus, with food distributors now regularly carrying delicious products like veggie barbecue “riblets” and vegan pizza.

Friends, colleagues, and students gathered beneath the vaulted ceilings of Memorial Church to remember the life of former history professor Angeliki Laiou. The acclaimed scholar of Byzantine history’s penetrating intellect and commanding presence created legions of followers who admired her academic expertise as much as her cosmopolitan sensibilities.“Angeliki Laiou’s family has lost its foundation. Greece has lost one of her most distinguished daughters. The international world of Byzantine studies has lost its most excellent historian,” said history Professor Michael McCormick. “Harvard has lost all of this and something more.”Laiou died of thyroid cancer at Mass. General Hospital in December. She was 67.As a scholar, Laiou spearheaded research in Mediterranean economic history and women’s history, and her 1985 appointment to lead the History department made her the first female chair of a department at Harvard.“She had the rare gift of an original mind, an iron will, and a penetrating intellect,” McCormick said. “She was fearless.”Elegantly coiffed and impeccably dressed, Greece’s former deputy secretary of foreign affairs would sweep into class like Pallas Athena herself, said history graduate student Rowan W. Dorin ’07.Laiou would sometimes affix a freshly cut rose to her blouse during her time as director of Dumbarton Oaks, said the research center’s current director Alice-Mary M. Talbot. Laiou “charmed” even the most imposing and volatile senior members of the history department with her staunch confidence in her intellectual abilities, said history Professor John Womack Jr.“Every day I come down that hall in Robinson, I think for a happy second I may see her door open and her well again, there in the light,” said Womack, whose office faced Laiou’s for the past twenty years. “The door’s closed now.”Laiou’s son, Vassili N. Thomadakis ’96, said the commencement of every new academic year invigorated his mother, who attributed her youthful appearance to her students. The degree of love and support of the messages delivered to her during her last days made Laiou “immeasurably happy,” Thomadakis said.“It’s a great comfort for me to know how many lives she touched while she was here,” he said.—Staff Writer Esther I.

Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced on Wednesday that the City of Cambridge will lose approximately $2.6 million in local aid for the fiscal year ending June 30—a nearly 10 percent decrease from the $26.7 million in local aid originally allotted.The cut is part of a broader $128 million reduction announced last Friday. Patrick said the cut will be expanded to $375 million next year, pulling another $6.6 million from Cambridge, as part of an effort to close a $1.1 billion shortfall in the state’s budget.The state provides local aid to cities and towns to support essential services like police, fire, and trash collection. The budget reduction is expected to force local officials state-wide to reduce or cut these services and lay off employees.“This is by far the worst financial situation we have had in the Commonwealth in the time that I’ve been an elected official,” said State Representative and former Cambridge mayor Alice K. Wolf.While some cities will make immediate cuts to balance their budgets, others, including Cambirdge, may be able to eke by without such drastic measures, said Cambridge Vice Mayor Brian P. Murphy, who said the city should be able to slow down programs rather than make wholesale cuts.“This year, we can probably make up the cuts through efficiencies, delays in hiring, and using reserves,” he said.The city manager is currently looking at this year’s budget to find where the cuts can best be absorbed, Murphy added.But coping with the expanded $6.6 million cut for fiscal year 2010 will likely be more challenging, he said, requiring the city “to take a hard look at programs and services.”According to Wolf, Cambridge will suffer disproportionately, since the city mainly receives additional assistance—unrestricted, general purpose funds—and lottery assistance, which are being cut, as opposed to protected Chapter 70 school assistance.Patrick is proposing several schemes to raise revenue in order to minimize the local aid cut for the coming fiscal year, including a 1 percent increase in statewide taxes on meals and hotels, which would raise $150 million to go directly to towns and cities.In addition, Patrick will attempt to give local communities authority to raise the meals and hotels taxes an additional percentage point; he also plans to eliminate a property tax exemption for telecommunications companies.Furthermore, Patrick is encouraging local officials to cut health care costs for unionized workers, either by putting employees into the state’s Group Insurance Commission health plan or by developing health care plans that would be as cost efficient as the state’s plan.According to Murphy, Cambridge’s current health care program is actually cheaper than the state’s plan.In the last economic downturn—between 2002 and 2004—about 14,500 teachers, firefighters, librarians, and other local employees lost their jobs statewide as a result of comparable local aid cuts made by then-governor Mitt Romney.Local officials said the financial strains of the cuts would be felt immediately. “This a difficult economic season and it’s going to get worse before it gets better,” said Cambridge city councilor Sam Seidel.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

The U.S. House of Representatives approved significant increases in funding for scientific research Wednesday, moving one step closer to reversing years of stagnant grant money long criticized by Harvard and other research centers.The bill would add $3.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health, which serves as the most significant source of the University’s federal research funding by far. The legislation would also give an additional $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, another key financial backer.The increases are part of a broader $819 billion economic stimulus package passed by the House. The Senate is set to consider a similar version of that legislation next week.Harvard chief lobbyist Kevin Casey said it is likely that the bill will pass “in the near future.” Democrats are hoping to ready a final version of the bill for President Barack Obama’s approval by the second week of February.Massachusetts, with its myriad research hospitals and universities, is the nation’s largest recipient of NIH funding per capita and is second only to California in overall funding. In 2007, Massachusetts received $2.2 billion in NIH funding—roughly 10 percent of NIH’s $22.8 billion spent on extramural research. Harvard received $1.4 billion, or 60 percent of the state’s allocation.Casey said he believed the stimulus represented a “substantial infusion of funds” for scientific research, and added that the money would have a “very immediate impact on good jobs and excellent science.” NIH has seen flat funding since 2003, with purchasing power decreasing by 13 percent due to inflation. As a result, the NIH now funds less than two of every ten grant applications, and thousands of approved projects await funding, according to Harvard statements on the issue. NIH has said some of the money from the stimulus package could be awarded in only four to six weeks, according to Casey.Harvard has used its clout to push hard for more federal science funding, and Casey said that its representatives have been on Capitol Hill, arguing directly to senators and house members that such a sweeping economic stimulus package would be incomplete without funding for basic research and “intellectual infrastructure.”Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Life Science Collaborative—co-chaired by University President Drew G. Faust and the heads of MIT, Genzyme Corporation, and the University of Massachusetts—wrote a letter to the state congressional delegation advocating for increases in NIH funding, writing that each grant awarded creates an average of seven jobs, and that every dollar invested in the NIH generates twice as much in economic output. They also wrote that “the next generation of scientific leaders [has been discouraged] from pursuing careers in biomedical research” as a consequence of eroding federal NIH support and delays in grant-making.  Glen Comiso, a director at the Life Sciences Collaborative, said that the House bill is fairly comprehensive and is “in the range” that Harvard and other institutions have been seeking for years. But he added that while the funding meets short-term needs and would help clear the clogged pipeline of NIH projects, the Collaborative wants to ensure that there would be adequate long-term funding as well.The bill also allocates billions of dollars to increase the maximum award levels for Pell Grants and Stafford loans that go toward undergraduate financial aid. While Harvard’s comparatively generous aid program may dampen the need for such federal funding, Casey said that Harvard has tried to “raise [its] voice in the national interest and not simply in Harvard’s best interest.”—Staff writer Peter F.

Writers and nature-lovers gathered to discuss “Nature and the Written Word” yesterday evening at the Barker Center during a roundtable discussion sponsored by the Museum of Natural History and the New England branch of PEN, an organization of writing professionals.Moderated by Tufts English professor Dale Peterson, the conversation featured authors John Elder, Sy Montgomery, and Katy Payne, who talked about the connection to nature portrayed in writing.“Nature writing encompasses robust narrative and well-grounded observations from the science of the natural world,” Elder said. He said that 20th century nature writing—as well as the 19th-Century Transcendentalist movement’s emphasis on the connection between people and the environment—had greatly inspired him.“Most people are not interested in nature. We’re more interested in other people,” Peterson, the moderator, said. “The trick is to draw people away from the human experience to another foreign experience.”Montgomery stressed the connection between people and the rest of creation in her writing. “My goal is to make people care about the green sweet world,” she said.Harvard Museum of Natural History Executive Director Elisabeth A. Werby ’72 used the words of conservationist Wendell Berry—“the only thing we have to protect nature with is culture”—to underline the importance of nature writing, especially in light the grave modern climate change situation. Payne said that as a nature writer, she finds that humans’ separation from nature is a more severe crisis than either global warming or the decimation of forests. “Most of the world now lives in urban areas. Children watch more T.V. than they play outside,” Payne said. “It’s an attitude change that needs to be reversed.”Audience member and Harvard environmental research librarian George E. Clark said after the talk that people need to change their perspective.“There needs to be a shift from the human perspective to the natural one,” he said. “Think about how many environmental problems are at the root of social problems.” —Staff writer Carola A.

The Cambridge Health Alliance will close six of its primary care facilities and merge them with existing clinics in an effort to decrease expenses in the face of massive state-imposed budget cuts, CHA announced in a press release Wednesday. 
Over the next year, CHA will reduce full-time employee positions by 8 percent, through a combination of layoffs, early retirement, and reduced hours, according to the release.
The news caps a year of financial difficulties for the Alliance, which instituted a hiring freeze last February in the face of a mounting deficit and last October announced it would lose $55 million in funding for the fiscal year ending this June.
After the October announcement, CHA was in the process of laying off 300 employees and had already begun a strategic planning process to determine where costs could be cut.
CHA is a network of more than twenty hospitals and clinics in Cambridge, Somerville, and other communities north of Boston that serves 700,00 primary care patients. The Alliance receives 85 percent of its funding from state and federal sources, including Medicaid and Medicare.
Doug Bailey, chief communications officer for CHA, said these efforts will ensure the Alliance’s survival because they were planned in concert with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services and other state agencies that helped plan the state-wide cuts in October.
“As painful as parts of this are, and we’ve emphasized that we think we have a vision that takes us out to 2015 that focuses on providing services to poor communities of Cambridge,” Bailey said. “We’ve forged...a commitment of a partnership and adequate funding going forward—we’ve convinced the state of the necessity of our livelihood.”
Bailey said that every facility slated for closure is within half a mile of the site with which its services will merge and that the Alliance tried to target the least utilized, least cost-efficient sites for mergers. 
But some of the mergers were necessitated by a lack of federal and state reimbursement, Bailey said. He cited CHA’s Whidden Hospital in Everett, Mass., which will reduce its number of inpatient psychiatric beds from eight to five.
“To maintain addiction services is to incur loses,” Bailey said.
Cambridge City Councillor Sam Seidel called CHA’s plan “a good-faith effort to consolidate without cutting core mission.”
Although it is unclear how much CHA can save through the proposed restructuring, Bailey said the Alliance hopes to cut $50 million in costs this year, and $100 million total by next year.
According to the press release, the proposed changes include ending inpatient pediatric services at the Teen Health Center in Cambridge and closing several ambulatory primary care centers, including two within the city limits—the North Cambridge Health Center, and the Riverside Health Center. The Cambridge Eye Center will also close. 
Bailey said that the City of Somerville will be most affected by the cuts.
The Alliance will hold a series of three meetings next week—on Feb. 3, 4 and 5—to solicit public comment on the proposed restructuring. 
Although Seidel praised the Alliance for frequently reporting its plans to the Council, he said it needed to improve its communication with the public. 
“I am not alone in thinking that CHA needs to do a better job of keeping the public up to date in a realtime way,” he said.

A legal battle pitting a Harvard Law School professor against a major music industry organization came to yet another standstill last week as the two sides disagreed over the parameters of a hearing originally scheduled to take place last week.  
The case involves Boston University graduate student Joel Tenenbaum, who was sued in 2005 by the Recording Industry Association of America for deliberately downloading seven songs from a file-sharing Web site.
Last November, Law School Professor Charles R. Nesson ’60 became involved in the case when he filed a counterclaim on Tenenbaum’s behalf against the RIAA.
In the counterclaim, Nesson questioned the constitutionality of the RIAA’s application of the Digital Theft Deterrence and Copyright Damages Improvement Act of 1999, which penalizes copyright violators up to $150,000 per song willfully downloaded.
The RIAA then responded with a motion to reject Nesson’s counterclaim.
Nesson, who founded Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, also requested that a proposed Jan. 22 hearing be broadcast publicly over the Internet.
According to the professor, broadcasting the case over the web would increase accessibility and make the court realize the internet’s power.
District Judge Nancy Gertner agreed to allow the hearing to be broadcast online, but the RIAA appealed Gertner’s decision, claiming that broadcasting the hearing could selectively favor Nesson’s arguments.
“We are always pleased to present our cases in open court,” said Liz Kennedy, a spokesperson for the RIAA. “But the exercise that the professor is engaged in is one of pure theatrics. We are not interested in furthering the promotion of the professor’s academic exercise in a court of law.”
In addition, Nesson made a motion to put Matthew J. Oppenheim, a former senior vice president for the RIAA, under oath for questioning.
According to Nesson, Oppenheim is the architect of the RIAA’s entire litigation campaign.
If Nesson’s request is granted, he said he would ask Oppenheim to detail the steps taken to decide why to go after Tenenbaum.
In response, Nesson said the RIAA is seeking to sanction him unless he withdraws this request. 
He said he could receive a reprimand, a fine, or more severe consequences, depending on the judge’s decision.
“This is a personal attack, lawyer to lawyer. But they [the RIAA] don’t think a personal attack is a big deal,” he said.
Although the case has been moving forward, Nesson said he sees no definite end in sight. But he hopes “that it’s over by the end of the spring semester.”

Noted health care economist and former Dean of the Social Sciences David M. Cutler ’87 will become the latest Harvard professor to serve in the Obama administration, he said in an interview late last night. Cutler joins three other members of the economics department already headed to Washington—rounding out a group that includes professors Jeremy C. Stein and Jeffrey B. Liebman, as well as former University President Lawrence H. Summers, who heads the National Economic Council.“I think that people who have the opportunity to help their country and the world need to, at times, do that,” Cutler said of his leave.Cutler was one of the chief architects of President Barack Obama’s health care plan—a hot-button issue during the presidential campaign—and said he will continue to work on health care policy in D.C.Cutler first came to Harvard in 1991 as an assistant professor, received tenure in 1997, and recently finished a 5-year stint overseeing the Faculty’s social science departments as divisional dean.Outside academia, Cutler has served on President Clinton’s Council of Economic advisers and on the National Economic Council, in addition to advising both Bill Bradley’s and John Kerry’s presidential bids. He has been consulting with Obama since at least April 2007.Cutler, who specializes in health care and public economics, is a vocal proponent of increasing America’s health care spending, arguing in his most recent book, “Your Money or Your Life: Strong Medicine for America’s Health Care System,” that such spending has been worthwhile despite its high costs.“He had a strong voice in developing President Obama’s health policy ideas, so I am expecting [the policy he implements] will continue down the general lines President Obama outlined,” said Richard G. Frank, a professor of health care policy at Harvard.Asked about transitioning from academia to a government position, Cutler noted that his academic work is applicable to the real world. “Health care policy as a field is one where academics are integrated into policy debates much more than in other areas,” Cutler said.Cutler had planned to be on sabbatical for the spring semester prior to his appointment and said he plans to return to Harvard after his time in Washington. Raj Chetty ’00, who accepted a tenure offer from Harvard just months ago, will fill Cutler’s place in the department while he is on leave.“A central function of Harvard is to develop new ideas that are important, and...developing those ideas can involve translating them to real world policy,” said Economics Department Chair James H. Stock, who received Cutler’s official leave form yesterday. “In that sense an important part of what we do here at Harvard is to provide leadership...in the public sector and the public domain.”“Sometimes you believe in something and the time is right,” Cutler said of his decision to move south.—Staff writer Noah S.

A dining manager allegedly accused two chatting female dining hall workers of being lesbians, according to the president of the union representing Harvard’s dining staff.Janice Loux, Unite Here Local 26’s president, said the manager asked the two women, “What are you, lesbians?” Loux said the manager may have wanted the workers to move on or stop their conversation.The details of the incident, the manager’s exact comment, and the context of the remarks are still under investigation by the union. Loux did not identify the manager or the two women.“I, an openly gay woman, object to any mistreatment of our workers on the basis of sexual orientation,” said Loux. “Quite frankly, I believe that Harvard will not tolerate this either. I don’t believe the head of dining services tolerates any of this nonsense.”HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin declined to comment in an e-mail, saying that “the University takes such matters very seriously,” but adding that it would be inappropriate to remark on specific personnel issues.Undergraduates learned about the anti-gay remarks from an e-mail sent to the Adams House open list on Tuesday by openly gay Adams House cook William D. Nicolson.Nicolson sought to collect gay pride items and pass them out to students to wear in the dining halls.“There’s absolutely nothing wrong with being proud of who you are,” Nicolson said. Yesterday, Nicolson affixed a black pin with the word “pride” and a rainbow triangle to the front of his white cook’s hat.Adams House cook and the union’s Chief Steward Edward B. Childs, who is involved in the ongoing investigation, said discrimination based on sexual orientation has been increasing recently.“It’s not a coincidence that Proposition 8 came up in these economic times, trying to undo something that’s already happening, just like post-Reconstruction,” Childs said. “We’re going to put a stop to it.”Childs said specific details, such as the name of the House in which the incident took place, would not be available until Monday.Nicolson’s e-mail spurred BGLT tutors in Adams and Lowell Houses to encourage a demonstration of gay pride in their dining halls. “It’s part of Adams House tradition to be a place of diversity and tolerance but also a locale of activism and support for the entire Harvard community,” Adams House BGLT tutor Christopher J. Hanson wrote in an e-mailed statement.Hanson also contacted Adams junior and BGLTSA Secretary Christian L. Garland ’10, who forwarded Nicolson’s message to the BGLTSA e-mail list. Garland wrote in an e-mailed statement that he will “press [BGLTSA] to become more involved with other interested organizations (like SLAM) to form a more coherent and organized movement against anti-LGBTQ discrimination.”Lowell House resident tutor and BGLT adviser Marcus Alexander also forwarded Nicolson’s e-mail to the Lowell open list, urging both straight and gay students to wear something symbolizing BGLT pride to dinner Wednesday night.“Whatever the facts and the final resolution of the case, it is important to show that Lowell is open and welcoming to gay, lesbian, bi or trans staff, just as we are the home to all Lowell students and tutors regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity,” Alexander wrote in an e-mailed statement.—Staff writer Danielle Kolin can be reached at dkolin@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard Law School announced Wednesday that it has received an anonymous donation of $10 million in honor of Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62, to fund research and a faculty chair in his name.The donation will finance an endowed professorship and support teaching and research activities, conferences, and fellowships in constitutional law.Steven Oliveira, the law school’s dean for development and alumni relations, declined to comment on what connection the benefactor had with Tribe or the Law School, saying only that the donor “is obviously someone who is an admirer of his work and career.”The donation—one of the largest gifts tied to an endowed professorship in the history of the Law School—comes at a time when educational institutions around the country are slashing budgets due to shrinking endowments.“This is a huge gift even for an institution like Harvard Law School,” Law School Professor Richard H. Fallon said.Although some major donations include both pledged and secured amounts and can take years to finalize, this gift has been completely secured, Oliveira said. He added that the donation was unaffected by current economic conditions and will be divided between funding the professorship and related activities, though administrators have not yet determined how the funds will be divided.Until Tribe retires, the professorship will be called the Thurgood Marshall Professorship of Constitutional Law. Upon his retirement the position will be renamed the Laurence H. Tribe Professorship of Constitutional Law.Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor, is the second most cited constitutional scholar in the country and garnered increased media attention during the past two years as a result of his connections to President Barack Obama. During his time at the Law School, Obama served as Tribe’s research assistant and later called the professor one of his mentors at the school. Dean of the Law School Elena Kagan and Obama’s Solicitor General-designate also studied under Tribe at the Law School.Fallon, also a professor of constitutional law, praised Tribe’s work yesterday, saying that his contribution to the field made it only fitting that a Law School professorship bear his name.“It is obviously a profound tribute to Professor Tribe who has been an absolute mainstay of the constitutional law curriculum,” Fallon said. “He’s a scholar who has been the inspiration for a number of faculty over the years.”—Staff writer Elias J.

Former Harvard quarterback Andrew Hatch ’09-’11, who briefly started for football powerhouse Louisiana State University in 2008 after taking a leave of absence from the Crimson, has returned to Cambridge to pursue a Harvard degree, he said in a phone interview yesterday. Hatch, who left for LSU after his freshman season, could be a factor in the Crimson’s fortunes next year if he can secure athletic eligibility. The NCAA requires athletes to meet certain benchmarks for credit hours in order to play each season, and because Hatch is returning to Harvard without trying to transfer any credits from LSU, he will not be able to demonstrate the progress towards his degree that would normally be necessary for him to play. But he said he is petitioning the NCAA for a credit waiver that could put him back on the field. “I would like to continue with football,” said Hatch. “If the NCAA approves it that’s the next step.”Hatch said that he will find out whether his waiver application has been approved within the next couple of weeks.If granted eligibility, Hatch could bring some welcome complication to the Crimson’s quarterback situation. With fifth-year seniors Chris Pizzotti and Liam O’Hagan graduating in June, Coach Tim P. Murphy would have to decide between Hatch, Collier Winters ’11, and Matt Simpson ’11.Winters played in six games as a freshman in the 2007 season, while Simpson has seen more limited action, appearing in only one game in each of his first two years, making Hatch, with Southeastern Conference experience to his name, seem the likely choice. But Murphy has yet to be convinced.If Hatch is eligible to play, “he would have to start from the bottom and work his way up,” Murphy said.While he waits for the resolution of his football fortunes, Hatch said, he is here for the “unique chance” to pursue a Harvard degree.“I had a great experience at LSU, it was a great opportunity at the moment and I got a good chance to play and I felt good about that,” said Hatch who opened the 2008 season as LSU’s starting signal caller, only months after the team had taken home a national championship. His season was eventually cut short by injuries.“I got a couple of tough injuries and as things evolved I realized that Harvard was best for my future,” Hatch said.Murphy said that he was “certainly happy” to have Hatch back, but denied having anything to do with his former player’s decision to return to Harvard, or his petition to the NCAA concerning eligibility. “I think his primary motivation was academic,” Murphy said, “I told him all along that if [a Harvard degree] is something you want to do, you should do it.”—Staff writer Jillian K.

Sleepy students looking for their weekly Friday dose of free coffee from the Barker Center Café will instead now be greeted by a sign that reads: “We regret that the current financial climate does not allow us to continue to fund the free coffee program.”
The passing of the program, formerly sponsored by the office of the dean of arts and humanities, has drawn questions from Barker regulars, according to café supervisor Dorothy “Dottie” A. Melin, though most appeared to take the cut in stride.
“A majority of the people who come here are very nice and very understanding,” Melin said. “Although a couple of people, and I’d say three so far, have had some hot feelings,” she said. 
According to Melin, many café-goers have inquired over the disappearance but were still willing to pay for their coffees.
“But in this scary time you just can’t buy things every day, and that includes coffee,” Melin said.
Sociology graduate students Ethan A. Fosse and Nathan E. Fosse said they were unnerved by the language of the sign.
“Harvard’s endowment is still huge, even though it is shrinking,” Ethan Fosse said. “It would be great if they were more transparent about where the money they cut was going.”
Nathan Fosse said he was “very surprised” by the elimination of free morning coffee. 
“Mentioning the ‘current financial climate’ just adds to this culture of austerity,” Nathan Fosse said. “I can still pay two dollars for the coffee, but this still sends a strong message, and it concerns me.”
The coffee cut joins a long list of cost-reduction measures implemented at Harvard’s schools as they struggle to reduce budgets in the wake of an unpredented drop in the endowment.
The Barker Center Café initially served free coffee from Starbucks Monday through Friday once at 9 a.m. and again at 3 p.m. But two years ago, the cafe restricted free coffee to 9 a.m. and later to only Fridays.
“Harvard’s the richest place around here,” Melin said. “If they can’t even afford the coffee, it makes us wonder, you know.”

License violations forced popular restaurant and café Z Square Cambridge to close earlier this month, and due to financial difficulties, new ownership will not reopen the location, a consultant for the restaurant said yesterday.New management, brought in last October after investors ousted former owner David A. Zebny '84, plan to eventually close all four entities owned by the Z Restaurant Group—which has two other locations in Massachusetts and one in California—having deemed it no longer profitable, said Lynne A. Taylor, an independent consultant for the company.According to Taylor, the Harvard Square restaurant "was hanging by a thread," with its sales unable to sustain its operating expenses, particularly in the face of an economic downturn.She said that investors felt that Zebny "badly mismanaged" the businesses."Everybody who had invested in them did not feel confident in his management ability," she said.Zebny could not be reached for comment yesterday.While the new management was in the midst of taking care of the closure and liquidation of the restaurant in Cambridge, the eatery was suddenly forced to shut on Jan. 12 due to licensing problems.In a statement issued last week, the Cambridge License Commission faulted Z Square for "failure to apply for change of manager, failure to have a current worker's compensation insurance, a noise complaint within the six-month probationary period on their entertainment license, and unpaid police detail."The restaurant is scheduled for a hearing to resolve these issues on Feb. 10. But Taylor said that the restaurant will not return to the JFK storefront, no matter how the hearing goes. Future use of the space will depend on Cambridge Savings Bank, which owns the location.Z Square, which opened in Cambridge in Oct. 2006, has no signs on its locked doors explaining its fate. According to neighboring restaurant workers, prospective customers have still been knocking on the locked doors, to no avail.Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was "sad about this turn of events" when she saw the restaurant had closed, but remained hopeful for the business to survive in Cambridge. "We're keeping our fingers crossed because the location's great and the restaurant spent a lot of time and money with the space."Jillson described former owner Zebny as "active and generous" and said he had had a "wonderful relationship" with the HSBA.She also said that this was not an indicator of more general Square business turnover."Businesses come and businesses go," she said. "We're not seeing any more or any less than we normally do."—Staff writer Vidya Viswanathan can be reached at viswanat@fas.harvard.edu.
