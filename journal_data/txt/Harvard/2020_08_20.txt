After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final debate of the Massachusetts United States Senate Democratic primary race, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) leaned into the legislative accomplishments of his decades-long career in Washington while his opponent, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), made the case that the incumbent’s long track record is a fireable flaw.
With two weeks until the September 1 primary, Kennedy worked to cast Markey as disconnected from local communities, but failed to make any race-changing attacks as polls show a contest he once commanded is closing during the election’s final weeks.
“I think that is why the way in which you leverage this position — the way you use this position — is so important,” Kennedy said. “You have to be present in our communities.”
Markey pointed to decades of legislative accomplishments, including when he “took on the oil industry and the auto industry” in increasing fuel economy standards, securing Alzheimer’s disease research funding, and raising money for gun violence research.
“I have 500 of these laws, and I’m very proud of that record,” Markey said. Kennedy challenges the figure because it includes bills that he co-sponsored.
Kennedy and Markey sparred over campaign tactics and funding and blamed the other for the negative turn the race has taken.
In recent weeks, a pro-Kennedy super PAC has reserved more than $1 million of airtime in Massachusetts. Kennedy’s family members, including his twin brother, have been raising money for the PAC, according to the Boston Globe. Markey is also backed by a super PAC.
Markey called on Kennedy “to tell his twin brother to stop running negative ads” in the race and to ask the PAC to disclose its funders.
“It’s your father, your twin brother — just tell them to stop the negative ads and to disclose all the contributors,” Markey said. “That’s a simple thing to do.”
Kennedy shot back, accusing Markey of being responsible for the entrance of the PACs into the race at all. Markey declined to sign the People’s Pledge, which aims to limit outside money in politics, this cycle after doing so in 2013.
“The only reason why there’s super PACs in this race is because Senator Markey wouldn’t stick to his word,” Kennedy said.
Markey took heat in the opening minutes of the debate for a pair of resurfaced incidents involving his response to constituents’ pleas for help.
Danroy Henry Sr. — the father of Danroy “DJ” Henry Jr., a Black college student who was killed by a white police officer in 2010 in New York — has said that Markey was dismissive of the Easton family’s requests for help at the time. Henry Sr. said in a Twitter video that Markey used the term “colored” in a meeting with the family.
Markey, who now says the case should be reopened, pointed to a 2014 letter he sent to federal prosecutors calling for a review of the case.
“I apologize to them for their disappointment in the meeting,” Markey said.
Kennedy said the situation “is emblematic of why we need change.”
Markey also faced questions about a charge by another constituent, Colin Bower, who said Markey was “aloof” during a meeting after his children were kidnapped by his ex-wife and taken to Egypt.
Markey said he is proud of his constituent services, pointing to his advocacy on the opioid crisis and for student internet access.
“When I hear from families, and they say they need help, I go to bat for them,” he said. “I go to Washington, and I make sure that these laws get passed, they get changed, so that families in the Commonwealth get the protection which they need.”
The two candidates also fielded a pair of questions about higher education from graduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston.
Markey called for universities to provide some form of tuition refund for college students who are left to take online classes this fall due to the coronavirus. Both also called for protections and support for international students.
“I think that they should have the option of a refund,” Markey said. “I don’t think they should be tied to having their funding personally be tied to circumstances that are beyond their control. And I think we have to have total flexibility for these individuals.”
“Whether you’re an international or domestic student, you should have the ability to ask for your money back, or some reduction in charges, that reflects the changed circumstance,” he added.
Kennedy said the federal government should allocate funding to “ensure that those education institutions are able to make things work” and to “provide support for families so that they’re not financially devastated.”
“This is where the federal government needs to step up,” he said. “Why? Because we are presented with a series of false choices.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the University's introduction of new sexual misconduct policies, campus anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better criticized the administration for not adequately incorporating affiliates’ feedback in the drafting process of the interim procedures.
In a Friday press release, Our Harvard Can Do Better members wrote that the interim policy did not sufficiently take into account key demands it had submitted to the University via an “Anti-Sexual Violence Letter” in July, at the same time adminstrators were revising Harvard’s sexual misconduct policy to be in compliance with controversial changes in federal Title IX regulations.
“We appreciate the engagement from the University during this process,” the release read. “However, we are dissatisfied with the lack of adequate response to specific priorities highlighted in our original letter.”
The Anti-Sexual Violence letter, which garnered more than 1,000 signatures from Harvard affiliates, called on the University to adopt a more comprehensive policy to address sexual misconduct than the procedures released by Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos.
The letter also urged the University to commit to maintaining “preponderance of the evidence” as standard in its investigations as well as devise a policy that would address instances of off-campus sexual misconduct no longer captured by the new Title IX regulations.
While Our Harvard Can Do Better acknowledged in their Friday statement that Harvard had maintained these elements of its former policy, the organization criticized the administration for not incorporating other key demands such as the adoption of an affirmative consent policy and the institution of a more community-inclusive Title IX policy review process.
“We expect stronger efforts from the University in adopting a comprehensive definition of affirmative consent, centralizing community members’ input in preventative measures and procedural development, and strengthening community support beyond Title IX policy,” the group wrate.
Harvard’s interim policies will continue to classify sexual misconduct as behavior that is “severe, persistent, or pervasive.” This standard, which the University has used in prior years, maintains a broader definition of harassment than the more stringent criteria put forth by DeVos’s regulations — which define sexual harassment as behavior that is both “severe” and “pervasive.”
However, the organization still deems Harvard’s “severe” or “pervasive” definition of sexual misconduct too narrow and is asking the school to adopt a standard based on affirmative consent.
William M. Sutton ’23, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said this standard is already used by many other universities.
“We looked at other schools that have affirmative consent policies and some of the things that they include is very clear language that an absence of no does not mean yes,” Sutton said.
The group also criticized the administration for not engaging with their demand to defund the Harvard University Police Department — a measure that their previous letter called for on the grounds that the police can pose a threat to students of color and are intimidating to people who experienced sexual assault.
“That was a demand that was about the broader culture that we're creating on campus, but the university certainly did not even acknowledge that it was part of our demands,” Sutton said.
The group said they hope the administration will be more receptive to community feedback as it prepares to revise and formalize these interim policies over the coming year.
While Our Harvard Can Do Better members said they appreciated meeting with the Title IX office multiple times over the last two months, they still believe the University’s Title IX Policy Review Committee has been too “opaque” when it comes to its membership.
Priya P. Kukreja ’21, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better, said that the group was aware that the committee had two student representatives but still hadn’t been informed of who the students were or how they were selected.
“[We’ve asked] to democratize the process of choosing students to go on the committee — as well as publishing their names online — but we've had an inadequate response there,” she said.
University spokesperson Nate Herpich wrote in an emailed statement that the University benefited immensely from the “valuable input” of Our Harvard Can Do Better and other student groups while it drafted this policy under a “very short timeline,” and that it would be making adjustments based on community feedback in the coming month.
“In the coming months, the University will incorporate the experiences and perspectives of Our Harvard Can Do Better and other members of our community into closely examining the interim policies and procedures, while making modifications as appropriate to meet the needs of the community, and ensuring compliance with the law,” the spokesperson said.
Kukreja said that Our Harvard Can Do Better members understand the University faced constraints in implementing some of their demands, given the limited timeframe allotted by the Department of Education for the policy revision.
“We totally empathize with the university and are frustrated with the department of education as well for doing that,” Kukreja said.
“But a lot of the progress that we're hoping to see — a lot of that is going to depend on what happens in the next few months and how receptive the university is to student feedback,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the Office of the General Counsel's long-awaited report on Harvard's ties to Jeffrey E. Epstein, student groups across the University penned a letter to Harvard administrators calling for more transparency about new gift policies.
Harvard released a six-page "gift policy guide" in late May after the Epstein report recommended the University "develop clearer procedures establishing the review mechanisms for potentially controversial gifts” and “disseminate those criteria widely.” The guide was then published in the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, via a one-word link halfway through an article on philanthropy, and posted on the Harvard Alumni website.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee also shared the gift policy guide with deans, chiefs of staff, central administrators, and members of the Gift Policy Committee, according to University Spokesperson Christopher A. Hennessy.
Disappointed with the contents and dissemination of the guide, student groups sent a letter to Garber, Lee, and other top administrators on July 13 to address their concerns.
“We condemn the state of Harvard’s donation management,” the letter reads. “There is a stunning lack of transparency, accountability, and inclusion in Harvard’s gift policies, and the university’s recently released gift policy guide raises a number of questions and concerns.”
The letter called for mechanisms to “hold administrators accountable, vet potential donors, regularly re-vet current donors, and take meaningful action based on voices from the community,” as the guide did not outline how Harvard affiliates can report controversial gifts.
Student groups Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers Feminist Caucus, Act on a Dream, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering, the Harvard Kennedy School Equity Coalition, and Our Harvard Can Do Better signed the letter.
Marisa J. Borreggine, a graduate student in Earth Sciences and a representative of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers Feminist Caucus, said the roll-out felt “under the table.”
In fact, were it not for an article in The Crimson, she said she would not have known the new policies were released at all — the opposite of the “wide dissemination” recommended in the report.
Rebecca M. Mer, a fellow at the Kennedy School who helped write the letter, said she thought the content of the Gift Policy Guide fell short of the report’s recommendations as well.
“We do not believe that this equates to clear procedures establishing review mechanisms,” Mer said. “This doesn't meet that bar.”
The signatories also called for immediate dissemination of gift policies and student representation on the Gift Policy Committee.
“Harvard students, the university’s future donors, must be given direct voting power on the GPC,” the letter said.
Julia M. Huesa ’20, an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the motivation to sign onto the letter was in part to critique the “administration’s broader culture of opacity.”
William H. Sutton ’23, who also serves as an organizer with Our Harvard Can Do Better, agreed with Huesa, stressing the importance of student voices in decision-making spaces.
“We don't need to know every single thing that happens but we need to have some student voices because otherwise it's just going to be serving the interests of a select few and not the student body,” he said.
Garber and Lee responded to the letter on August 7, thanking the groups for their expressed concerns but reiterated the need for the committee’s members to remain confidential. Garber is the only named member of the committee, which he chairs, while its remaining membership is drawn from unnamed faculty members and senior administrators.
“The Gift Policy Committee must maintain a high level of confidentiality and discretion in order to ensure the integrity of its process,” they wrote. “This committee brings diverse expertise and a breadth of experience to its deliberations, and as a group, it takes seriously the responsibility to continuously review Harvard’s engagement with donors and to consider whether gifts are in the best interest of the university in the long term.”
Mike Yepes, another fellow at the Kennedy School who helped write the letter, said he felt “a lot of indifference” from administrators. Even after the response, Yepes said he didn’t understand the need for confidentiality.
“How am I, as the person impacted at the community level by the policy, supposed to put blind trust into a group who I don't know who they are, I don't know what their backgrounds are that justify their presence, and I don't know what agendas they might have?” he said. “There's a lot of potential and opportunity for abuse of power with no way to surveil about the abuse of power.”
Garber and Lee also encouraged the signatories to “submit a report about ‘Improper Giving or Receiving of Gifts’ through the Anonymous Reporting Hotline” should they or other Harvard affiliates have concerns about a particular gift’s surrounding morality.
But, in a response to Garber and Lee, Yepes and Mer expressed concern about the hotline, which they said few students know about, and questioned who would follow up on the complaints.
Mer said that despite months of organization, it felt like “just the beginning” of the conversation they wanted to have with the administration.
Hennessy wrote that Garber and Lee will respond to the students to set up a meeting at a later date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Coalition for a Diverse Harvard hosted an online panel for Harvard alumni last Wednesday to advocate for the immediate establishment of an Ethnic Studies department at Harvard.
The event, titled “What the Hell is Ethnic Studies? And Why Should Every Alum Care in This Moment?”, featured Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition activists Alondra Ponce ’21, Raquel C. Rivera ’23, and Ajay V. Singh ’21 alongside guest speakers University of Southern California professor and author Viet Thanh Nguyen, San Francisco State University associate professor Jason Ferreira, UCLA professor and filmmaker Renee E. Tajima-Pena ’80, and Harvard History Professor Philip J. Deloria.
Citing the 48-year-long history of activism calling for an Ethnic Studies department at Harvard, the students criticized the University for not having made sufficient progress. Harvard announced a faculty search for four Ethnic Studies professors in 2019, but has since suspended the search due to the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 70 universities offer ethnic studies departments, and many others provide greater faculty and financial support to their respective departments than Harvard does, Singh said.
He added that he believes Harvard’s 11 Ethnic Studies courses pale in comparison to the 49 courses offered by Yale University’s “Ethnicity, Race, and Migration” program during the 2020-21 academic year.
Raphael W. Bostic ’87, a Coalition-endorsed candidate for Overseer of the Harvard Alumni Association, said he thinks academics often communicate a general disrespect for Ethnic Studies.
“I think that what we've seen in our field and across the board is that studies around ethnicity are not respected. And that's a real problem, because it's really shutting out the experiences and the realities of so many people,” Bostic said during the meeting.
In addition to an established Ethnic Studies department at Harvard, HESC detailed its other demands, including the reversal of former Romance Languages and Literatures Professor Lorgia García-Peña’s tenure decision, the abolishment of the President’s ad hoc committee in tenure cases, and the creation of physical spaces for research and multicultural purposes run by HESC.
The University received intense backlash — demonstrated through sit-ins, rallies, and letters to administrators with thousands of signatures — after denying tenure on Nov. 27 to García-Peña, who specialized in Latinx studies.
Citing the Overseer and Elected Director positions on the Harvard Alumni Association, Coalition Board member Jane Sujen Bock wrote in an email that she sees endorsing candidates with an “explicit and active commitment to Ethnic Studies” as another integral part of the Coalition’s efforts. This year, the Coalition endorsed five candidates for Overseer and six for Director.
“They are not merely paying lip service to the idea of Ethnic Studies, but have a real understanding of the field, a desire to know more and a deep commitment to advocating for it at Harvard,” Bock wrote.
At the end of the event, three Coalition-endorsed candidates for Overseer of the Harvard Alumni Association shared their experiences with and conclusions on Ethnic Studies.
Bostic said he views Ethnic Studies as more than just studying issues of power, but rather as a window to understanding the burdens people of different ethnicities bear.
“Whatever ethnicity you have in this country, you carry extra burdens and that impacts how you interact with society, how you contribute to society and the things that are possible,” Bostic said. “That has real implications for our society and is really important for us to study.”
Like Bock, endorsed candidate David H. Eun ’89 discussed the influence of the Overseer position, and said he views the campaign for Ethnic Studies as a change that must happen with the support of people at levels of the University.
“I don't think Ethnic Studies should be something just for ethnic minorities and students of color,” Eun said. “Having those who are actually part of the power structure exposed, integrated, conversant and knowledgeable about Ethnic Studies is also part of the solution. And so I think it's something that I will passionately embrace."
Endorsed candidate Diego A. Rodriguez singled out Harvard dedicating a “committed budget” to Ethnic Studies as the solution to hiring a core faculty team and establishing the department.
“That's the way to transform this clear vision, which we all share here, into a reality, which will shape the lives of all hearts, all Harvard students for the better,” he said.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the criticisms from the panel and HESC's demands.

The past few months have taught us lots about gratitude, especially that it’s important to recognize the silver linings of each and every moment. For real. Your local grocery store ran out of toilet paper? Don’t fret. Make a trip to the second closest grocery store and call it an “adventure.” Shopping week is virtual? Don’t worry — we’ve got you covered with some ways to recognize the hidden Zoom ~blessings~ that surround us all.
You can’t feel guilty about leaving a shopping period class when it’s not in-person. The pang of guilt inside your stomach as you leave the crowded Science Center B during shopping week is no longer a worry when clicking “Leave Meeting” takes approximately 0.5 seconds. No one will notice (?), and even if someone does, you can go right back to finishing that episode of Grey’s Anatomy to distract yourself from worry.
Find your corona cutie. If those Facebook groups you joined circa March didn’t leave you with your sought-after corona cutie, use Zoom shopping week to finally find your Harvard match. Cuffing season no longer begins when the weather becomes groggy in Cambridge. Cuffing season begins here and now in the preview for the GenEd we know you won’t end up taking. We promise we can’t see you scrolling through the many Zoom screens to finally find the “one” (or maybe someone can, we don’t really know).
Shop while shopping. Literally. Get yourself in the mood for shopping week by shopping a course while simultaneously going online shopping. Nothing says Zoom college 2020 quite like that new pair of sweatpants you’ll wear every. single. day.
You’ll actually know what you’re getting yourself into. Course sites have been live for some time now and we’ve had lots of time on our hands to actually read the course syllabi. Unlike those regular shopping periods when shopping = going to the courses that friends go to, shopping period now is a completely personal experience. Read about those courses and shop what you want to shop!
Though in-person shopping week will be missed, virtual shopping week also comes with its pros. Now, shop ‘til you drop (or until you’re hungry for lunch, your Netflix screen asks if you’re still watching, or you take your 1000000th nap of the day).
