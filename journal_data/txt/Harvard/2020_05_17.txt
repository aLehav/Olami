After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a group of new friends asks protagonist Esther “Esty” Shapiro (Shira Haas) why she left her insular Hasidic Jewish community in Williamsburg, her response is somehow both hesitant and direct: “God expected too much of me.” This weighty answer anchors much of Netflix’s new German-Yiddish miniseries “Unorthodox,” a compelling, beautiful account of why and how this young woman left her husband and roots to make a new life in Berlin. Leaving an unhappy arranged marriage in any insular community is bound to be tied up with radical controversy, but this ambitious series explores her difficulties and moral quandaries with precision.
Esty grows up in a Satmar Jewish community, a group descended mostly from Holocaust survivors. What makes them different from other Hasidic communities is that their values are largely developed after WWII and, as such, are shaped by intensive trauma.
Marriage to Yanky Shapiro (Amit Rahav) initially appears to Esty like the start to a stable life she has always sought, but the relationship turns out to be stifling. Retellings of Esty’s life in Brooklyn are based on Deborah Feldman’s memoir while the parts about Esty’s present day life in Berlin are almost a new story entirely. “Unorthodox” is incredibly structurally sound, carefully weaving the past into the present-day story through flashbacks.
The first episode deals primarily with Esty’s escape to Berlin and the new friends she makes at a music conservatory. Though women are prohibited from performing in her community, Esty has always had a knack for music and attempts to join the Berlin school to follow this long-suppressed passion. Later episodes redirect the attention to her initial marital bliss, followed by the anxiety issues she and Yanki suffer in the bedroom. There is intense pressure on the young, inexperienced couple to conceive, which only places all the more strain on their crumbling marriage.
The series portrays Esty’s two worlds with gusto. The past and present are juxtaposed perfectly, only serving to explain facets of Esty’s guarded behavior. “Unorthodox” is not just interested in representing her Williamsburg community, but also present-day Berlin.
There is certain logic in Esty returning to the site of her community’s trauma in order to discover herself. Berlin unapologetically shows its wartime trauma through its various monuments, and the characters are constantly pointing these memorials out to Esty. Those who grew up around the city are more at ease with talking about the city’s troubled past than she is. At times, her perspective makes us question the easiness which has grown around such historical atrocities, but for the most part, the show emphasizes how a new generation of Berliners, both Jewish and non-Jewish, have come to redefine the city by its diversity and ability to change.
This new Berlin is most evident in the form of Esty’s multicultural friends at the academy, who hail from as far as Yemen and Israel. Members of the Jewish and Arab diasporas studying Bach at this staunchly German academy may feel unexpected for some American viewers, but by representing a diversifying Europe, the show demonstrates its accuracy.
Esty’s arc is reflected not only through her character, but also in her self-presentation. As she begins to grow more confident and open to others, she wears more makeup and Western clothing. These details demonstrate just how careful creators Anna Winger, Alexa Karolinski, and director Maria Schrader were in framing this story. Overall, the show holds itself accountable in representing these communities: The team hired Yiddish consultant Eli Rosen not only to translate the scripts, but also to maintain accuracy in clothing and ceremonies. All of this contributes to the authentic voice of this project.
The show boasts some truly phenomenal actors. Haas is incredibly controlled as Esty and delightful on screen. Every emotion is written in her face, and a simple movement of her expressive features is all that is needed to render her character’s struggle and repression. Moreover, Haas captures the central paradox of Esty’s character perfectly: her desire to at once belong to a community, but also an unconscious drive towards autonomy and transformation.
The supporting characters are also beautifully acted. Rahav manages to lend Yanki pathos in spite of his harsh impatient treatment of Esty. In those scenes that Rahav shares with Haas, the two portray the couple’s shyness and awkwardness flawlessly, such that their trepidation around each other is almost palpable.
Alex Reid is also lovely as Esty’s mother, Leah. Her character is the forerunner for this story: a young woman who also left her community after being tied down in an unhappy marriage. Now living in Berlin with her partner Nina, Leah has to relive her choice once again through her daughter. Reid gives this character the complexity she deserves, although it is easy to blame her for much of what happens to Esty.
Though the series’ tone is quite serious, it gives way to some glimmers of humor, for example, when Esty is taught about her sexual organs for the first time and almost refuses to believe that she has them. The ability to capture humor in such a sober tale is emblematic of the show’s wide cast net. It manages to encompass these vastly differing communities successfully and thoughtfully. While the ending certainly leaves enough room for future exploration, it ends triumphantly with Esty’s new found confidence and voice — a beautiful conclusion for such a carefully crafted series.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the ubiquity of the saying “April showers bring May flowers,” we all know that there are still plenty of rainy days in May. Happy songs might help to boost our mood, but the urge to listen to music as grey as the sky outside is simply irresistible. As we’re stuck in isolation and preparing for finals, sometimes we just need a moment to step away from our screens and sit at the window, getting lost in the showers. Missing sports? Watch a riveting race between two raindrops sliding to the bottom of the windowsill. Having another quarantine meltdown? Put on your best brooding face and pretend to be one of those movie characters who looks out into the rain, contemplating every choice they’ve ever made. This playlist is the perfect soundtrack to accompany these moments of escape, featuring ten mellow songs that range from cathartic to calming. Cozy up, make yourself a cup of tea, perch yourself next to a window, and enjoy.
“Be My Mistake” by the 1975
Ready to dive straight into the emotional deep end? Let’s start with the saddest song on The 1975’s album, “A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships.” The instrumentals are sparse, with just guitar and interjections of piano accompanying Matt Healy’s beautifully raw vocals. Throughout this song about the guilt that comes with figuring out young love, it feels like Healy is singing straight into your soul.
“Slow it Down” by The Lumineers
Now that Healy has set the mood, it’s time for The Lumineers to maintain the melancholy. Wesley Schultz’s voice embodies the ache of growing apart from a lover, as he begs his partner to come home and rest. While she refuses, we can embrace the feeling of grogginess that comes with the rain and allow ourselves to slow down.
“Visions of Gideon” by Sufjan Stevens
It’s no surprise that this song was chosen to accompany the heart wrenching ending of “Call Me by Your Name.” Listen to it. Feel it. Be Timothée Chalamet, but instead of crying as you look into a fireplace, cry as you stare into the grey outdoors.
“You’re Gonna Break My Heart Tonight” by Tom Odell
By the end of this song, Odell’s heart won’t be the only one that’s broken. His articulation of a doomed romance will leave you in tears, the song only made more emotional by his heartfelt belting and the climactic swell of percussion and saxophone.
“Cherry” by Harry Styles
Although the guitar driving this song seems lighthearted and upbeat, the lyrics tell a painful story of the breakup between Styles and ex-girlfriend Camille Rowe. It’s the perfect combination of sad and soothing, bound to inspire a (slightly depressing) walk down memory lane.
“Alone Again” by Faye Webster
It’s easy to feel more isolated on days when going outside isn’t really an option. Webster excellently voices this feeling of loneliness with her wistful tune, fit for a pensive state of mind.
“Standing in the Rain” by The Paper Kites
Standing in the rain is not recommended, but recognizing and allowing yourself to feel any frustrations that you have with the world is a must. The Paper Kites’ transcendent vocals validate the feelings of sorrow that uncontrollable circumstances bring, with lyrics like “Don’t take shelter stand in the rain / It’s meant to feel that way.”
“Like Real People Do” by Hozier
Now it’s time for a sweeter tune — the hug that everybody needs, offering warmth and coziness on such a rainy day. Put down your tea, grab a nearby person or pet, and slow dance in the living room, basking in Hozier’s rich voice and tranquil melody.
“Grow As We Go” by Ben Platt
Another song fit for a slow dance, Ben Platt’s “Grow As We Go” lightens the mood even further, with soft guitar and effortless, dreamlike vocals. Platt will take you on a wholesome journey of finding someone with whom you can grow and learn, reminding you to be grateful for the supportive people in your life.
“Goodbye Rain” by Hush Kids
Hopefully this playlist gave you a moment to escape the stress of COVID-19 and all of its consequences, even if it meant plunging into a sea of dreary songs. Hush Kids end everything on a brighter note with uplifting harmonies and a cheerful tempo. Take a deep breath and soak in the musical sunshine. You got this.

Making art is an experience grounded in its social aspect: so much of the joy of creating comes from collaborating with others. This epidemic has created a new normal, one of physical distancing and lives that have to be lived online. Nonetheless, art can still be used as a way to connect. Here’s a list of the top five artistic hobbies to help you stay connected and keep boredom at bay, while also social distancing.
5. Learn TikTok dances
There’s something unbelievably satisfying about watching a TikTok dance 100 times and finally getting the moves down on the 101st. The joy of recording the 15 second video is unmatched, and seeing a dance spread like wildfire on social media reflects the connectedness of our world. As our lives shift to the online sphere, dance is an all-too-welcome reminder of our physicality.
4. Do a FaceTime photoshoot
Video chat can be more than just a medium for awkward Zoom classes and bittersweet check-ins with far away loved ones. Enter the FaceTime photoshoot, a trend where photographers across the globe are taking advantage of the Live Photos feature on FaceTime to continue portrait photography while social distancing. It’s a way for photographers to practice directing and framing shots, and models to perfect posing and styling. Most importantly, it’s just another way that creativity can thrive, even in (physical) isolation.
3. Bake banana bread
Being stuck at home all day calls for baking, and what’s better than a bread that’s incredibly delicious yet doesn’t call for any kneading? Yes, I watch “The Great British Baking Show.” No, I don’t want to bake anything that requires sitting around while it rises. We exist. Baking banana bread is the perfect quarantine cooking activity for a lazy baker, or someone who just wants to hop on the baking bandwagon.
2. Upcycle some clothes
Just because you aren't seeing anyone in person doesn't mean you have to sit in sweats all day (no shame in spending the day in PJs, though). Go to the back of your closet and give new life to those tees and cardigans you never wear. Turn oversized t-shirts into totes or add cute side stripes and patches to those old jeans. Upcycling your clothes can save money, is sustainable, and will get you ready to stunt when we get to show off those fits.
1. Finally play the instrument that’s sitting in the corner of your room 
Does anyone else claim to play guitar when you have to come up with a fun fact, but really you haven’t picked it up in months and you’re too scared to try to play again because you’ve probably forgotten everything you knew? With all of the assignments I’ve been procrastinating, playing guitar has been a re-discovered source of joy. If you don’t have an instrument, try playing with GarageBand to make some beats and come out of quarantine with a newfound credential for your resume: SoundCloud producer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a seven year break, American rock band the Strokes released their sixth studio album, “The New Abnormal,” on Apr. 10. The album, expertly produced by the legendary Rick Rubin, is a glittering blend of ’80s pop and The Strokes’ own characteristic edge — most notable in frontman Julian Casablancas’s grunge-style vocals. The album spends most of its time grappling with the ruins of a romantic relationship, as Casablancas sings about everything from painful regrets and self-blame — in songs like “At the Door” and “Not the Same Anymore” — to rose-colored nostalgia for lost love on “Why Are Sundays So Depressing.” Still, The Strokes retain their classic political edge on songs like “The Adults Are Talking” and “Eternal Summer.” Every track is led by the keyboards, synths, and vibrant guitars of ’80s synth-pop, giving the album an optimistic sheen that plays against its somewhat nihilistic subject matter, whether that be lamenting a failed relationship or the overall state of the world.
The opener, “The Adults Are Talking,” perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the 45-minute album. In it, Casablancas criticizes corporations and the “stockholders” of the world over an infectious melody, complete with snare hits and synthesizers that could have come directly from a Duran Duran single. “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus,” too, is fueled by these typical tropes of dance music, as Casablancas sings, “And the '80s bands? Oh, where did they go?” Despite the relentlessly-upbeat tempo and crystalline production, Casablancas’s lyrics reflect an inner turmoil over his personal relationships and their setbacks. “Is it just them? Or maybe all me? / Why my new friends don't seem to want me,” he sings cheerily on “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus.”
Though the whole album is clearly a product of ’80s nostalgia, some songs sound especially familiar — most notably “Bad Decisions.” The fourth track on the album, “Bad Decisions” is proof of what happens if you marry two ‘80s classics: Modern English’s “Melt WIth You” and Billy Idol’s “Dancing with Myself.” The chord progression sounds exactly like the former, while the latter manifests itself in the chorus, where Casablancas sings that he’s “makin’ bad decisions” over and over again, to the same exact melody as Idol, his voice laid back and lazy. In the song’s bridge, a guitar solo blazes with all the fanfare of glam rock, complete with the obligatory finger tapping and high sustain of the genre. Still, the song is one of the best on the album and endlessly fun, practically begging you to dance along.
With the current Covid-19 pandemic, we are all in many ways living a “new abnormal.” That wasn’t necessarily the only thing that The Strokes had in mind when they named their latest album, however. In an interview with the L.A. Times, Casablancas said that “‘the new abnormal’ was something Gov. Jerry Brown said during the Malibu fires in 2018, and there’s a parallel between global warming and the coronavirus. A similar kind of threat to your reality.” Nowhere is that meaning more salient than in “Eternal Summer,” a vibrant song characterized by a peppy beat, clean guitars, and Casablancas’s own shining falsetto. “Summer is coming, won't go away,” Casablancas sings. Amid the song’s summery musicality, his words seem harmless enough. That is, until he sings that “They got the remedy / But they won't let it happen,” claiming that those in power instead leave the issue of climate change — or perpetual summer — to be a “mystery to solve for somebody else.” He sings too, of the world being in the “eleventh hour,” or the last moment before the predicted climate catastrophe, bringing a somber reality to the otherwise optimistic tune.
The last two songs on “The New Abnormal,” “Not the Same Anymore” and “Ode to the Mets,'' cement the album’s status as a homerun for The Strokes and an instant classic. In “Not the Same Anymore,” Casablancas sings about how he “fucked up” his past relationships, and how “he can’t change, it’s too late.” His pleading vocals, set against the backdrop of a smooth, hypnotic guitar, make the song an aching testament to melancholy as it slowly drags on towards Casablancas’s realization that he is the one at fault for his romantic woes. “Ode to the Mets” brings the energy of the album back up, sealing it with one last ’80s dance track. The song starts slow, with ethereal synths and Casablancas’s brooding vocals making it seem as though the Strokes are letting you in on a secret. As it goes on, however, its synths and keyboards suck you in completely. “Pardon the silence that you're hearing,” Casablancas sings. “It's turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar.” A deafening roar is somewhat of an overstatement, but the song never fails to deliver as it moves from the pained vocals of the chorus into a smooth outro, fun and swirling as it leads you to the end of the powerhouse album.
They may have fallen under the radar for a couple years, but with “The New Abnormal,” the Strokes remind fans that they’re still a force to be reckoned with. Dancey yet gritty around the edges, “The New Abnormal” serves as both a sign of the times and a nostalgic reflection on the rock giants of the past.
