After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She had been sick for months. She was one of the first women in the hospital administration system in Calcutta and had fought with her bare hands and feet for her education. She was a fisherman’s daughter, a fisherman who learned to scribe and clawed his way up colonially rigidified social sub-castes. She actively wrestled and passively withstood hardship for her right to practice medicine. Against her caste, against her husband whom she married too young, against her children screaming for her to stay home.
She had fought, with her hands and teeth, for a medical degree that now served her not one whit. She was wasting. She was nauseous. She was waiting on a death sentence.
And he was in love with her. He had been since she was 15. She used to stop traffic walking across the street in her school skirt with her nose in a book. He would chortle and swig his scotch and tell people about the accident that his young “girlfriend” caused between the rickshaw and the ox cart. He promised her he would have her, Brahmin or not. She was no Brahmin. She was too far from him in caste. His family would never have her. But he couldn’t not. For years he followed her, doing his business and his schooling on the side. They tell a famous story about him, about how he shook one of professors out the window, dangling him by his ankle, maintaining a light enough grip to shake him until he promised a different score. He convinced her that he had found alternative energy sources in the mid twentieth-century, long before any such technology had been invented. “He could make tractors run on water,” she would tell the other girls in her convent school. So she finished high school, and she ran off with him.
“I was never in love with him. Never once. I only knew that after I married him, but I didn’t even think about being in love. I was more swept along by the sheer force of his personality. He had 17 girlfriends, but he only wanted to marry me.”
She would say later on that perhaps he knew it was the only way he could get her. Nothing, then, was more serious than this marriage. Nothing, then, but this marriage could have stood between him and his Brahmin mother, the wrinkled woman in the white sari who would not let your feet touch her door if you were in your monthly. She would not speak to his new wife. This new wife, who had the audacity to not know how to cook most of the things her son loved to eat, who had the audacity to believe she was going to medical school because she graduated with such honors. She was his, then. Her family was horrified by the fact she had run away, and were, in the small Mumbai flat, usually without the means to support her regardless.
She took his beatings the whole time she was in school, and the minute she got her first residency position and she came home, her daughters watched. “Mummy laid the paycheck down, and everything changed.”
There were the daughters. There was the painful learning to boil oil far away enough from her face. There was the picking him up and putting his scotch down next to the charred pots and pans too many nights in a row. There was the laying of the garland of jasmine on the altar hand in hand. There was the braiding of her hair early in the dusty Calcutta morning.
And now there was waiting on the ambiguous death sentence. And he disappeared. He disappeared.
He made the pilgrimage to Manasarovar, the beautiful, sacred lake in the Himalayas by Mount Kailash. She couldn’t keep any food down, and her daughters were lost, both in secondary school and confused as to why there was nothing they could do.
He made the pilgrimage and walked around the long, beautiful lake three times. He prayed, though he had never prayed before, for the wife he had always been in love with, the wife who would never be in love with him. He prayed for her beyond all the violence he had done her, to take any illness into his own body, to leave her clean.
He prayed and he returned, and he never spoke of it.
Her recovery was inexplicable, and no one in her family has been deeply religious since.
He died of colon cancer three years later, and I would never know my grandfather.
My grandmother is still alive today, hale and beautiful, and she is the one who taught me that—whether shared or unrequited, known or unknown—there is no task that love cannot accomplish, no evil that a great love cannot undo.

The artists:
In defense of foreign language study, American author Lydia Davis wrote in the New Yorker that every language is “a form of music. Each music is different … [and] it is variety, and the rich provocativeness of variety, that we lose if we give up foreign languages.” Over 400 years earlier, French writer and dance theorist Jehan Tabourot wrote in his treatise on 16th-century Renaissance dance that “dancing is a kind of mute rhetoric by which the orator, without uttering a word, can make himself understood by his movements.”
While Davis argues that language is art, Tabourot argues that art is language. This centuries-old discourse between language and art suggests that the two entities are interchangeable, which is perhaps a reason for art’s persistent relevance on the global level today—all over the world, there are people who have listened to the same Beethoven symphony, who have learned the same Samba dance routine, or who have viewed the same paintings. In this vein, what unites dancer Gaby D. Czarniak ’17 and violinist Sumire Hirotsuru ’16 is their belief in the power of art as a universal language, as a ubiquitous communication tool that transcends traditional language barriers.
The primary connection that Gaby and Sumire make between art and language comes from their own international backgrounds. Sumire grew up in Japan and had little English speaking ability upon arriving in the U.S. as a freshman. As a participant in Harvard’s Freshman Arts Program, she found herself using music, rather than words, as her primary communication tool. “Music became the way I communicated with other people and how I made friends and expressed myself,” Sumire says. She regards music as an effective language in itself; in fact, she enjoys saying that she speaks “Japanese, English, and music.”
Sumire is particularly passionate about music as a communication tool in an academic environment such as Harvard; she explains that the opportunity to amalgamate the arts and academics into a single educational experience is unavailable to most students in Japan. “There is no music curriculum in the University of Tokyo, and it is rare in Japan to do music and academics at the same time,” she says, adding that it was for this reason that she turned to the U.S. for higher education. In order to bring more music opportunities to Japanese students, Sumire helps run a program every summer called Summer in Japan, in which a small cohort of Harvard students travel to the Japanese city of Oita to teach English classes to Japanese schoolchildren as well as run diverse cultural programming, from classical concerts to film screenings.
Gaby, a dancer and beginning choreographer, comes from a similarly international upbringing. Although she went to school and grew up in the U.S., she was raised in a multilingual household. “We spoke a lot of different languages at home, so languages are now really important to me,” Gaby says. Despite her linguistically diverse background, she sees dance as her most evocative means of expression: “Sometimes it’s hard to express myself with words, so dance ends up being my favorite language of choice.”
For Gaby, dance is an effective language because of the power of physical gestures to instigate subtle yet surprising emotional responses in the audience. “Dance incorporates a lot of psychology,” she says. “It relies on our assumptions about how body language will be interpreted, how bodily movement leads toward understanding.” To demonstrate the psychological power of dance, she cites a fight sequence from the Harvard Ballet Company’s latest production, “The Jungle Book,” in which she walks slowly in a straight path toward the character Mowgli with her back to the audience. “That positioning in itself has a scary undertone, and it’s really cool to be able to communicate that statement,” she says. “Even small things like the degree to which you’re turned away from the audience makes a difference.”
Gaby and Sumire share a mutual sensitivity to language as well as a genuine passion for the “art” of communication that could inform a collaborative project in novel, poignant ways. There already exist several art projects today that integrate international voices and transcend linguistic boundaries, creating truly unique outlets for artistic creation. Examples include the Silk Road Project, an organization initiated by cellist Yo-Yo Ma that explores multicultural exchange through collaborations among artists, composers, visual artists, and storytellers, and OneBeat, an annual initiative of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs that brings together 25 musicians from around the world to write and perform original music and to develop innovative approaches to music-inspired social entrepreneurship. In these projects, although participants come from diverse cultural backgrounds with different means, standards, and gestures of communication, art becomes a powerful unifying force, serving as the common language that all involved can speak. Echoing these initiatives, the combination of music and dance against the backdrop of international perspectives can become a means not just of acknowledging, expressing, and distinguishing different cultures and languages but also of fusing these cultures into a single, common understanding of the human experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout college, I’ve developed what I like to call a healthy dose of intolerance for malfunction. I say “healthy” because this intolerance fuels my passion for problem solving as public service. Along with this, however, I’ve also grown an unhealthy theory crutch. I say “unhealthy” because theory is rarely the thing that gets me on my feet and on the ground. The bittersweet thing, now, is that I see similar symptoms present in the vibrant hackathon syndrome of today’s socially relevant technology sphere.
Over the past few years, we’ve seen countless civic hackathon events pop up all over the country in the name of everything from healthcare to elections. In the span of just two days, from May 31 to June 1, last year’s National Day of Civic Hacking sprouted more than 120 events across 103 cities. Adjectives like “broken” or “dysfunctional” are often attached to the theme of the hackathon in event descriptions. Luckily for the new generation, today’s civic hackers are itching to tackle age-old problems like campaign finance and citizen engagement with innovation.
The underlying philosophy of holding hackathons is a no-nonsense one: It’s broken, so let’s fix it. As a generation whose social lives were born into the seemingly perfect color patterns and layouts of no-glitch social networks like Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter, we meet malfunction with confusion and frustration. We wonder why it occurs, and why more isn’t done to fix it. One visit to a civic hackathon will erase any doubt that the confusion and frustration have been healthy and productive. Last year’s Civic Hacking Day produced more than 100 projects alone on important topics such as education, homelessness, the environment, healthcare, and criminal justice.
But why do we so rarely see hackathon projects making a truly big impact? If all that developers promise at hackathons on international development, healthcare, and criminal justice had happened, wouldn’t we be living in a utopia?
Many of the most successful civic innovation projects today (look at Google’s public transit and election APIs) have been the result of months or years of the quietly diligent work of setting bridges and leveling out risk among various public and private data holders to build a network of cooperative data standardization. Organizing is a good phrase to describe how the groundwork (and not just in terms of data) for truly impactful civic tech projects is born, and what today’s hackathon projects aren’t doing particularly well.
Nothing is really broken if you think about it. It’s just that people aren’t always good, diligent, creative, and outward-looking. The reason that the 21st century's techno-euphoria relies on technology to change everything in the world is because making new apps and finding points of “disruptive innovation” is easier than changing our fellow human beings.
I’ll end with a story about a civic tech project that is slow, but doing it right in my opinion. The project Open Referral, whose goal is a standardized community resource directory database, has been in the works for quite some time. The proper title for a person behind these projects is not “hacker” but “organizer.” They travel city by city, combing carefully through each one. They form relationships, build bridges, and open people’s imaginations to the impact that their information has on thousands of disadvantaged individuals. At the end of their data organizing campaign, the human chemistry behind their giant database will be quite the mind-blower.
Today’s hackathons are rightly full of the energy, initiative, and frustration that power them. But at the end of the day, the civic apps that come out of these events are no more than the political philosophy papers I churn out as a poli-sci student if they are not built upon and for grassroots initiatives and participation. In the face of technology that has increasingly allowed us to do more with a single click or swipe, we must not forget to sweat for the solutions to our malfunctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School announced in January that it would adopt its own procedures for handling sexual assault, thereby departing from the University’s centralized approach. The procedures include a school-specific Title IX unit and legal counsel for involved parties. We believe that this break from the University is troubling because it detracts from Harvard’s efforts to unify its different schools; at the same time, the Law School’s actions reflect the University’s need to improve the process by which it develops central policy, especially by incorporating more voices in that process.
The University’s current endeavor to unite the university’s twelve degree-granting schools—called the One Harvard campaign—has spearheaded a $6.5 billion fundraising campaign. It has also led developments from the consolidation of Harvard’s 70-plus libraries to the coordination of its schools’ calendars. Breaking from this progress by unilaterally announcing unique sexual harassment procedures, instead of pursuing internal change through the administration, is a concerning development. The existence of separate procedures unique to the Law School threatens the consistency of decisions across the University’s graduate and undergraduate schools and could lead to a number of unintended but detrimental consequences, such as wide disparities in the experiences of both survivors and accused individuals between schools.
However, the current situation is largely a product of the University’s over-sized administrative structure. In a recent op-ed in The Chronicle of Higher Education, titled “The Silencing of Harvard’s Professors,” Law School professors Charles Fried and Robert H. Mnookin argued that “Harvard faces a serious governance problem that requires institutional change.” They warn of a growing central administration and the consequent deterioration of autonomy for individual schools.
It is certainly true that the role of administration has greatly increased in recent years, and not necessarily to the betterment of the University. On sexual assault procedures, University President Drew G. Faust has defended Harvard’s administrative structure and maintained that the decision-making incorporated representatives from across the University. However, as Fried and Mnookin pointed out, “These policies and procedures were arrived at by a working group of administrators… [and] [t]here were no law faculty members involved.” When law faculty first saw the procedures, many expressed their disapproval. On matters that affect the entire University, Harvard as an academic institution must base its decisions more on its faculty, and less on administrators.
This break in procedures from the Law School has proved unfortunate for the University’s public relations and for its larger goals. To prevent similar situations in the future—and for the sake of achieving full representation—Harvard should incorporate more perspectives in this type of decision-making; the University’s central policy must consider input not only from administrators, but also from faculty. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the University must show a cohesive front on campus-wide issues—such as sexual assault—both for the sake of consistency and for that of unity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This place is so hypocritical,” a tutor in Pfoho whispered to me as the credits rolled and the screening ended. “We denounce this stuff and then invest in oil,” he continued. We had been watching “Merchants of Doubt,” a new documentary based on a book of the same name by Harvard professor Naomi Oreskes. The film examines the links between climate deniers and supporters of Big Tobacco, tracing the ideological and monetary ties that bind.
As I sat in Pfoho dining hall that evening, something clicked: I support Divest Harvard.
I have been hesitant to back the movement. Activists have accosted Drew Faust with a camera, and sat in at Massachusetts Hall. These tactics have seemed to cross the line of propriety. If we want to live in a community, we should treat people accordingly, and shoving a recording device in someone's face seems to miss that point.
But my earlier dismissal has wavered upon further thought. In the taped confrontation between Faust and the activists, a group of Harvard University Police Department officers follows her. This is a powerful symbol of one point of tension between the University and Divest: The administration, either through security details or spokesmen, sometimes shields itself from open dialogue. Faust, for instance, only sets aside two or three blocks of time each semester for office hours with University students. To press a conversation with her, Divest activists have little choice other than to catch her in the Yard or occupy Massachusetts Hall.
And that's how it's always been done. When activists in the Student Labor Action Movement wanted the University to pay its workers a fair wage, they took over Massachusetts Hall. Shortly thereafter, the administration agreed to do right by employees. Contrary to the reflexive opposition protest actions arouse from many on campus, they are, in many cases, effective, just, and necessary. No one can hold a conservative administration accountable to save us. And as we have seen, the big-wigs at Harvard Management Corporation and University Hall have much for which to answer.
Many criticize Divest Harvard on the grounds that, in its practices and goals, it only aims for spectacle. But spectacle generates change. Bold demonstrations grab the attention of an apathetic campus. Symbolic moves to remove fossil fuels from the University's portfolio signal that we take climate-change seriously and that forces which obstruct forward movement will face censure.
Others might say that it would be hypocritical for us to divest from fossil fuels because we require them to run the University. But every institution, no matter its resources, exists within systems of power that constrain its freedom to act. To call divestment hypocritical would imply that we have some direct choice in the energy sources available to us. Fossil fuels companies, in fact, use their muscle to stymie the development and adoption of alternative energy.
In the past, and in these pages, I have ridiculed certain forms of activism. More and more, I fear that I have been mistaken, at least in part. Activists sometimes distort the truth. Activists sometimes fail to respect others. Activists sometimes trample values of pluralism. We should call out these errors when we observe them. But without activism, this campus would be more gray and conformist than it already is.
This University engages in questionable economic and social practices abroad, at home, and on campus. Harvard's investments in fossil fuels—and those of other universities, charities, and pension funds—legitimate an order that degrades the environment and imperils our future on this planet. Rather than ask why Divest activists appear so angry, we should ask ourselves why we do not.

I have never seen the show. I have never read the book. And, in case anyone was wondering, I have never been to a women’s prison. So why did I choose to go hear Piper Kerman, author of the book “Orange is the New Black,” speak on the busy Monday night of March 30? To be completely honest, I just wanted to get my newly purchased copy of the book signed. Luckily, I got much more out of it than just a signed book.
The night starts with a technical glitch, as events that happen in Science Center B often do. One of the volunteers for the event, a young man wearing an appropriately colored orange shirt, tries to pass the time by making a few awkward jokes. The audience laughs politely, but the crowd is obviously eager to see Kerman as soon as possible.
Eventually, the divine intervenes, and the video in question begins playing. The audience watches as Piper Chapman, the lead character in the Netflix original series “Orange is the New Black,” speaks.
“Look, I understand that religion makes it easier to deal with all of the random shitty things that happen to us,” Chapman, who is based off the woman we are about to meet tonight, says. “And I wish I could get on that ride, I’m sure I would be happier. But I can’t. Feelings aren’t enough. I need it to be real.”
“We cheered loudly as an organization and a community when we heard that clip,” says Greg M. Epstein, Humanist Chaplain at Harvard.
By Phillip Ramirez
Epstein’s organization, the Humanist Hub, is hosting the event. The Humanist Hub is an organization where atheist, agnostic, and non-religious people can come together to “Connect, Act, [and] Evolve,” according to the group’s motto. Epstein and his colleagues had invited Kerman to Harvard in order to award her with the Humanist Heroine of the Year Award. The award reads: “Feeling aren’t enough. I need it to be real.”
“A lot of us read the book,” Epstein continues, “and we realized that it’s so humanistic in a very deep way. It’s just pro-human, and it’s good for people to take into account the message Ms. Kerman has to share.”
Soon after the clip is played, Kerman is given a chance to share that message. Epstein welcomes Kerman to the stage amidst thunderous applause. After accepting her award, Kerman takes her place at the podium, and immediately makes clear why she is receiving the award. Kerman challenges her audience to reconsider their assumptions about the people serving time in prison, their speculations about what life is like on the other side of those prison walls, and their opinions about the effectiveness of the criminal justice system.
“The themes that I think are most important in the book, that I hope come through loud and clear, are themes around race and class, which are the two biggest determinants in terms of who will be incarcerated in this country and
who will not,” Kerman states. “We know that in this country, the criminal justice system disportionately pursues and disproportionately punishes people of color and, very disproportionately, low income people.”
Although Kerman advocates for criminal justice and prison reform throughout the night, her true message is that the people in our nation’s prisons are human too.
“A prison is a place incredibly devoid of color,” Kerman says. “All the real color and vibrancy and life come from the people filling up these institutions.... And I thought it was important [to write this book], because I was just so incredibly rescued and saved and validated by the humanity of the other women I did time with.... I hoped that the reader might feel that way as they walked in my shoes, or walked in the shoes of one of the other women who is depicted in the book. ”
By the time Kerman concludes, the room felt a little bit different. Kerman’s message of humanism had truly touched the hearts and minds of all who were present. And I as I stand as the final member of the line to get my book signed, it finally hits me. I’m glad I hadn’t read the book or seen the show before coming to see Piper Kerman. I wouldn’t have seen her the way she wanted me to, the way she wanted all of us present to. Instead of seeing a character from a show or the narrator of a book, I saw a human being.

Advising Fortnight is here, reminding all of us freshmen that we’re almost a quarter of the way through our time at Harvard. But instead of being a positive celebration of Harvard’s 48 concentrations, Advising Fortnight-related emails and ambushes in the back of Annenberg give off the vibe of an advertising blitz gone wrong. FDO: Stop trying to make Advising Fortnight happen. It’s not going to happen. Stop handing out hundreds of glossy flyers to freshman in Annenberg—let’s be real, they just throw them into the recycling bin outside the door, anyway.
Instead, FM suggests that the FDO try hosting Food Fight Fortnight, an opportunity for students to get real hands-on experience in their concentrations with like-minded freshmen. We imagine it would play out something like this...
March 30, 5:45 p.m., Annenberg Hall
The kick-off battle rages. HUDS greeters John and Francine watch in horror as students throw sugar cookies like ninja stars and jab at each other with those pointy waffle cones. The SEAS kids are firing a custom chicken nuggetlauncher towards masses huddling behind overturned tables as future Folklore & Mythology concentrators chronicle the violence. Meanwhile, the Government crew takes advantage of the popularity of the dumplings, employing a bait-and-switch technique to isolate small groups of History & Literaure concentrators. Suddenly, the Music kids drum up a battle march and charge the freshman interested in Visual and Environmenal Studies, who are sitting on the ground and smearing gravy on their faces. Off to the side, swai-covered Philosophy kids re-evaluate their existence while the Economics crowd brainstorms how to profit off of the battle’s aftermath.
March 31, 3:30 p.m., Maxwell Dworkin Lobby
The Computer Science kids have no need to use real-life food in a fight. C’mon guys, they took CS50! Instead, virtual food provides these techies’ artillery. The Internet is their battlefield. Fingers stained orange with Cheeto dust and bodies fueled by Red Bull and adrenaline, the CS hopefuls hunch over their laptops and fight for their lives. Without warning, a student curses as he mistakenly opens a hamburger patty e-bomb.
“Rookie mistake, loser,” smirks the guy next to him. Across from them, two girls sweat profusely as they flood each others’ screens with virtual organic vanilla soy milk. In the center of the room, a shimmering hologram of David J. Malan ’99 looks on, proud of what he has created.
April 3, 1:00 p.m., Boylston Hall
Baguettes. Everywhere. The Romance Languages and Literatures department is a mad house, with students using the shorter loaves as swords and the longer ones as lances. Portuguese rolls, usually soft and fluffy balls of delight, have become deadly projectiles. Tempers are flaring, and students hurl insults in multiple languages. The Francophiles attempt to assert their superiority over the plebeians who dare study Spanish. The office staff, hoping to explain the program’s numerous study abroad opportunities, shouts at the crowd, but the diverse array of ethnic food continues to fuel the cacophonous battle.
Bonus: These events are sort of like physical education classes, too; you can’t expect Applied Math and Pure Math to battle it out without burning some calories! So FDO, get on board. Let’s make this happen.

There’s method acting and then there’s method journalism. There are some things you do for the sake of the craft and then there’s going too far. I was assigned to write a piece about breaking Passover. In case you don’t know, “leavened” products (most bread, pasta, and pastries) are prohibited during the holiday. In order to feel the sweet satisfaction of biting into some bread for the first time in over a week, I thought I’d follow the restrictions of Passover for a few days myself. As someone who eats an egg and cheese bagel for breakfast, cereal in between meals, and is constantly rewarding herself with cinnamon rolls (I deserve it for writing the header on my paper, don’t you think?), abiding by the limits of Passover was something I could not do. Even for the sake of journalism. Sorry, FM. To make up for it, I scoped out some of the best places to grab a meal once Passover is over.
Bruegger’s Bagels in Porter Square
Who knew a “New York Authentic” bagel is just one stop away on the T and a 10 minute walk from the Quad? Or that bagels are kettle boiled? Or what kettle boiling is? Bruegger’s brings you both the bagel background and bagel bliss. It boasts 336 possible combinations of bagels and spread. Aside from the standard favorites, it also offers rosemary olive oil, sundried tomato, and cranberry apple bagels, to name a few. The shop offers a unique range of spreads including cucumber dill, bacon scallon, and smoked salmon cream cheese. Eating a cinnamon sugar bagel with peanut butter and jelly was the highlight of my day even after I got an email noti- fying me that my Friday 9 a.m. was canceled. How’s that for an endorsement?
Georgetown Cupcakes on Newbury Street
With Finale closed (I swear I’ve never rewarded myself for finishing work with a whole cake), I have to settle for tiny cakes (or cupcakes, as some call them). You’d think that the lack of size would come with a lack of flavor. Or so I thought until I stumbled upon Georgetown Cupcakes on Newbury Street. The store offers its most popular flavor, red velvet, every day, as well as different specials for each day of the week, including mint cookies and cream, peanut butter fudge, and salted caramel. Check the shop’s Twitter or Facebook for the free flavor of the day, and trust me when I say nowhere in the Square has cupcakes comparable to these.
Flour Bakery and Cafe in Central Square
Located in Central Square, this branch was opened in 2010 by Joanne Chang ’91. The sticky bun alone is mentioned in 162 Yelp reviews. There’s even a sticky bun bread pudding alongside warm croissants, scones, brioche, and french toast. Donuts, rice crispy treats, and Boston cream pie cake round out the menu. Pizza, stuffed bread, and a variety of cookies continue to make it a post-Passover fantasy. The only downside is that a lot of people have discovered that they key to “making life sweeter” is “eating dessert first,” so get there early to try to avoid the lines.
Petsi Pies on Putnam Ave
What if you’re desperate for pastries and aren’t willing to make a trip? I’ll let that “pass” just this once, because after Passover, you might not have the energy to make the trip due to gluten deprivation. Besides, you’ll cetainly satisfy your sweet craving at Petsi Pies—and you should be just fine making the short journey past Berryline. It offers the banana chocolate chip muffins and but- termilk currant scones you’ve been craving for the past week. Next to the brioche, streusel, and poundcake are sweet pies from Mississippi Mud to Mixed Berry. You definitely can’t go wrong with Classic Apple. Not in the mood to eat a whole pie by yourself, or only have friends who have been enjoying leavened products all week? Petsi serves pies for one to two people as well as six to eight (I wouldn’t judge you for getting the largest size after that severe withdrawal—no one has to know).
Hi-Rise on Mass Ave
This is what I would consider Panera Bread’s slightly more upscale cousin. You might be familiar with their sandwiches if you’ve ever used your BoardPlus at the Barker Center café. What that café doesn’t offer, though, is all of the bread loaves you’ve been missing out on (along with a charming waving cat figurine—what’s up with not having one of those, Barker Center?). From seeded to flute, baguettes, and huron, Hi-Rise even offers signature Jewish challah. And, if you want to check out the café while still following Pass- ove rules, Hi-Rise has you covered with unleavened chocolate and almond mac- arons and chocolate fallen cakes. While everything else is pretty overpriced, the bread is pretty reasonable. The vanilla loaf and sourdough were my favorites.
What else can you do when Passover’s over? If these joints don’t make up for the eight breadless days, try making jokes about it being “toasty” outside, pulling a Katniss and falling in love with the baker’s son, or putting a bun in someone’s oven (only joking). Eat your cereal in a bread bowl for all I care—after this past week, you totally deserve it.

Turns out, people are really worried about what cell phones are doing to our brains. Society’s uptick in wireless phone use has seen a corresponding rise in books, articles, movies, cartoons, and editorials condemning what these devices are doing to our psyche and our relationships. (As a comment on the sheer volume of content produced on this topic, I briefly considered making each word in the above sentences a hyperlink to a different piece of media condemning cell phone use. My roommate assured me that that would be obnoxious.)
The abundance of media criticizing cell phone use simultaneously terrifies and excites me. The articles seem to promise that if I jettison that one 2.31 by 4.87 inch piece of machinery, I will become a paragon of physical and emotional health. I’ll be more productive. I’ll save money. My interpersonal relationships will be fuller. I’ll balance the two infinities of past and future into a quasi-divine understanding of the present. All I have to do is get rid of the phone.
Finally, after weeks of begging my editor to let me write this story, she acquiesced. I gave up my phone and Facebook account to my roommate. The terms of this experiment were laughably soft. Five full days is hardly a huge commitment. Also, I was allowed email, which admittedly ruins the point a little but was necessary if I wanted to stay enrolled in school. Given this set of constraints, I figured that this week probably best mirrored the conditions for a student in the early 2000s: access to email but not to phones or social media platforms.
While poking around the Internet, I quickly learned there’s a specific sort of outline for the “I went a certain period of time without my phone/electronics” article. First, you talk about how terrible your phone addiction was making your life. Then, you talk about how much more rich/full/overall cheerful your life was after you got rid of your phone. Lastly, you exhort everybody to join you in setting down their phone for a little while to come bask in the joy of self-actualization.
That’s not exactly how things happened.
I quickly found that if I wasn’t checking my phone, I needed something else to do. As it turns out, that something was constantly eating Gold Emblem Peanut Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets. I bought a large tub of them at CVS on a whim the night I gave up the phone and proceeded to munch on them throughout the night and well into the next day. Before midnight of the first day, I had finished the tub. For reference, that’s around 3,500 calories and 322 percent of my recommended daily intake of sodium solely from Gold Emblem Peanut Butter Filled Pretzel Nuggets.
Thankfully for my future cardiologist, my sodium intake gradually declined as the week progressed. Nevertheless, my diet was abysmal during the period without my phone, although that might be due to a willful resentment of my Nutrition Gen Ed more than any phone-related reasons.
More important perhaps than my impending triple bypass surgery was the difficulty of making a phone call on the dorm red phones. Harvard, it seems, has allowed its landline infrastructure to fall into a disgraceful state of disrepair. Although it was undoubtedly cool to take calls (admittedly exclusively from my parents) on the dorm red phone like I was JFK negotiating the Cuban Missile Crisis, the dorm phones are operating at far from peak performance. Outgoing calls were impossible. The ringer was either inaudibly quiet or terrifyingly loud. And on Thursday, my mother somehow ended up connecting with Weld 42’s phone rather than my own after dialing my dorm’s number. I apologize to Mingu and his roommates for the inconvenience.
Overall, however, my time without my phone wasn’t particularly harrowing or even very noteworthy. Despite weird bouts of desire to make a fake Facebook account to catch up on all the crucial Facebook activity I had missed, I didn’t miss my phone too much. What was upsetting was realizing that those articles lied to me. I didn’t suddenly have the work ethic of Alexey Stakhanov just because I didn’t have a small buzzing box in my pocket. I didn’t even finish my weekly pset any earlier than usual (damn you, CS51). Last and most shocking of all, I didn’t suddenly understand all human emotion or achieve self-actualization.
That said, there were definite benefits to the experiment. Walks to class were much more pleasant without my head craned over my phone. I got to see Weld 42’s tastefully appointed common room (credit to Mingu and his roommates).  And, I got to scoff pretentiously at my roommates for using their phones while I surreptitiously ate some Gold Emblem Peanut Buter Filled Pretzel Nuggets I’d snuck into Annenberg in my pocket.

We know it’s hard to believe, but your professors actually have lives—and academic careers—beyond that 10 a.m. lecture. This fall, a number of Harvard’s faculty members will be going on sabbatical to write books, conduct research, and take a breath outside the Harvard bubble. FM spoke with a few to find out their plans:
Professor Andrew Warren, John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Humanities
This fall, Warren will be doing what all English professors do best: writing, writing, and writing some more. He’s got several projects in progress, ranging from an article on the use of plot in 1790’s Gothic novels to one on David Foster Wallace’s relationship with MFA programs. This still isn’t enough for Warren, however—he’ll also be plugging away at his second book, which focuses on the concept of entanglement in Romantic authors’ work.
“Research leaves are a fantastic opportunity to synthesize ideas produced in teaching and giving talks,” he says. “On a leave, you can really get into a rhythm where you can give shape to those ideas.”
Professor Paul Y. Chang, Assistant Professor of Sociology
Chang’s research focuses on South Korean social and political change, so—surprise, surprise—he’ll be heading to South Korea next fall to collect data.
“Right now I have nothing to write on,” he admits. “Usually when you’re in the final stages [of a research project] and writing, it’s better to stay in the office. In the beginning stages, if your data collection needs are such that you need to be outside, a sabbatical’s a great time to do that.”
Chang plans to collect data from the citizens of Seoul, conducting interviews and garnering quantitative data about South Korea’s changing economic structure. Although he speculates that the project will begin as a series of articles, culminating in a longer narrative-form book, he also acknowledges that he’s still in the process of organizing his thoughts and choosing what direction to pursue.
“One good goal for a sabbatical is to clear out all the clutter and focus,” he says.
Professor Paul J. Kosmin, Assistant Professor of the Classics
For his sabbatical, Kosmin is going full Indiana Jones. After delving into the archives at the University of Oxford, he plans to conduct a series of research trips in the Middle East and Asia Minor. His goal: to investigate the emergence of linear time, or in his words, “time which is represented by a number, and just a number,” in the ancient Hellenistic world. Kosmin’s thesis is that the imposition of this “rational, disenchanted time” upon indigenous peoples resulted in the emergence of apocalyptic and messianic religious movements in the 1st century BCE.
As ambitious as all this might sound, Kosmin’s research comes from humble beginnings. He plans to focus his studies on bureaucratic records—basically, ancient tax forms. To find these, he’ll visit sites in Northern Israel and Turkey, although he plans to steer clear of the ones in Iraq. Once he’s wrapped up his archaeological adventures, he plans to spend the spring semester back in the United States, at Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C.
Apart from trotting the globe hunting for 2,000-year-old tax forms, Kosmin also has personal plans during his time in the United Kingdom. He’ll be catching up with family, getting married, and “[taking] a step back and doing some thinking.” Until the next flight to Turkey leaves, that is.

I visited the office of professor of History Sven Beckert to talk about his recent winning of the prestigious Bancroft Prize. On the door was a large poster for Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the 21st Century.” Professor Beckert, tall and well-dressed, grinned and invited me into his office with a firm handshake. History books, notes, and objects from his travels filled the room. He couldn’t grab a meal because he had to leave in an hour to fly to Dallas for a talk about his book, but with a wide smile and even wider eyes he talked enthusiastically about his life’s work.
Fifteen Minutes: First, can you give a brief summary of your book, “Empire of Cotton?” Professor Beckert: Basically, the book is an effort to understand the history of capitalism in the past 300 years, but it does so by telling the history of cotton. Cotton is very essential to the global economy before the Industrial Revolution, but when the Industrial Revolution unfolds in the 1770s, 1780s, and thereafter, cotton becomes the absolute center of industrialization in the U.K. but also with the cotton textile mills in New England, and throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century, cotton is very central to the global economy. And what it allows me to do unlike many other histories of capitals is it allows me to focus on the global aspect of the history of capitalism, the links between the plantation economy in the American South and the industrial economy in New England, the connections between imperial expansion and colonialism in Asia and Africa, and the emergence of free trade ideas in the UK and elsewhere.
FM: That’s such a huge topic. How do you even begin to research that? Where do you start?Beckert: It’s a very big topic, but in some ways because it focuses on cotton, there was something to hold onto, so I could follow that commodity around the globe, and that’s basically how I started researching that. So, where is it grown? Who’s trading it? How is it traded? How is it manufactured in some other part of the world? And then eventually, how is it consumed? So, basically, you follow that commodity wherever it takes you.
FM: Did you go visit many of these places and talk to people?Beckert: I researched on every continent. From Australia to Japan to India, all over Europe, to Latin America.
FM: What were some of the more interesting places you got to go to do your research, or experiences you had while you were there?Beckert: I could write another book about just my research because it was so, so interesting. The most difficulty I definitely had in Egypt, in Cairo, where I spent weeks sitting in the waiting room of the national archives because despite the fact that I had permission to study, in the end they wouldn’t let me in the archives. I spent 10 days sitting in the waiting room, sipping tea with the director. Part of the point of the book is that it’s not written from the vantage point of, let’s say, Cambridge, Mass. That’s only possible if you actually go into the archives and research in parts of the world.
FM: Do you think capitalism today should be modified based on what we’ve learned about 19th century exploitation?Beckert: In some ways, the way how we designed the world we live in is up for grabs. It’s subject to human influence and to our interests and what kind of world we would like to create. It’s not a force that is outside of human possibility. Sometimes the book is a kind of dark story because it deals with slavery, a lot of violence and coercion. It’s not a happy story, but on the other hand, I think it is a happy story because it does emphasize the importance and possibilities of this enormous human creativity.
FM: Part of me has always felt that capitalism is in some ways pretty fundamental.Beckert: Look, it structures all aspects of our lives. This is why I work on capitalism in the first place, because I think it’s one of the most important facts in our life. But I don’t think it’s innate in the sense that it’s just a realization of human nature, it’s very historical. It takes on a particular shape because of its particular history.
FM: So you think that it’s feasible that world history could have taken a different turn and we could be living in a completely different kind of society today, even with similar technological innovations.Beckert: That’s a good question. I’m trying to explain how we ended up with the world we are living with right now, but I think you’re right in some ways, you know there is contingency. There is choice. Things can turn out differently. Do they have to turn out this particular way? I don’t know, but even though the book is dark, it left me with a certain optimism that this is something we built as humans.
FM: If you had to give advice to a time-traveler going back to the 19th century, who really wanted to make it big without exploitation, what would you tell him or her?Beckert: If you think about the late 18th century and early 19th century in the U.K., then I actually compare the early cotton industry with the Silicon Valley industry today. The people who had little capital and wanted to try something new, often went to cotton manufacturing, and many hundreds of thousands of people did so, and it was spectacularly profitable. By the 1850s or so, that was not so much the case anymore. Then it was more railroads or steel mills.
FM: Do you yourself wear cotton clothes?Beckert: Yeah, it’s impossible not to! Like, you do!
FM: Of course. I’m guilty.Beckert: Cotton, the fabric itself, has certain qualities which are clearly superior. You know it would be very unpleasant to wear wool clothing in the summer. Linen is also kind of scratchy.
FM: When you were a kid, did you want to be a historian?Beckert: Yeah. Isn’t that weird? Strangely enough I always wanted to be a historian. I was always interested in history, but I came to that kind of history much later.

Last fall, some members of the all-male Fox Club wanted to go co-ed. For over 100 years, the club had invited only men to join the club through the traditional process of punch. A few members, however, believed that it was time to put up women for potential admission into the group.
This wasn’t the first time that members had brought up that topic, says Reverend Douglas W. Sears ’69, the Fox Club graduate board president. But Sears was clear in September: “There is no plan this fall to punch any women, period.”
Sears, who was also president of the now-defunct Inter-Club Council in the 1990s, says he wants to make sure undergraduates think critically about changes they might make to the club.
“There are some undergraduates who are perhaps looking for their place in history more than they are for doing something that’s actually workable,” Sears says. He added that he directed one member, who was leading a move for the Fox to punch women, to write a position paper on the proposed move’s implications and potential outcomes.
More than a dozen members of the Fox did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
In general, Sears says that any “major” changes would need approval or consultation from the club’s graduate board.
“The undergraduates of the Fox Club can vote on whatever they want to, but that doesn’t necessarily leave anything other than expressed opinion,” Sears says.
The Fox is one of many undergraduate groups, including The Crimson, that has a graduate board. Many undergraduate clubs and groups, whether recognized or unrecognized, have grad boards that oversee their functions. Final club grad boards have existed for decades. Other groups on campus, like Harvard Student Agencies or Fuerza Latina, however, have just begun to form theirs.
Grad boards are groups made up of Harvard College alumni who voluntarily take on oversight roles for specific clubs located on the undergraduate campus. Grad boards often work closely with undergraduate organizations’ leadership, though the extent of their influence varies from group to group.
Embedded into some clubs and campus groups is a latent tension between the old and the new. Though the clubs stay the same in name, members of grad boards oftentimes find themselves interacting with a student and campus milieu that differs from their own past experiences. Grad board members offer professional and even personal advice to college students. Yet, when undergraduates want to make changes to their organization, the balance between grad board power and undergraduate autonomy is tested.
John L. Powers ’70, graduate board president of the Fly Club and a former Crimson sports writer, jokes that he spends more time at the club than his wife may want. He chuckles softly at this remark, but there’s clearly some truth behind it. Depending on the time of year, especially before large events like the Harvard-Yale football game, he might be at the Fly between 10 to 15 hours a week, he says. In an average week, he spends a couple of hours at the club. A sports writer for the Boston Globe, he occasionally finds himself finishing some writing there.
For Powers, the Fly is primarily a graduate organization, with nearly 1,000 alumni members, he estimates, and only about 60 undergraduates. While alumni might not be allowed into all of Harvard’s campus buildings and dormitories, Fly grads can always find a way to get into the club.
“One of the things that I preach to the undergraduates is that 5 o’clock the day after Commencement, they deactivate your swipe from [your] House,” Powers says. “You become an intruder on this place. The Fly Club is one of the few places on campus where, for the rest of your life, you can come back to and know you will be welcome, have something in common, and your sons and grandsons in your family will be able to come in.”
Powers says the grad board at the Fly has to ensure that the club doesn’t go bankrupt, something accomplished partially through undergraduate dues, but mostly through voluntary alumni donations. Another concern of Powers’ is establishing that undergraduates protect the club so as to avoid what he considers a potential “liability.”
“As we tell the undergrads, I said: Think about if you want to put a 200-year club at risk or gamble it on the metabolism of an 18-year-old woman,” Powers says. “That’s what it comes down to.”
Powers, who was part of two clubs that disbanded before he joined the Fly—the Iroquois Club, which ran out of money, and the D.U. Club, which was shut down following the beating of a high school football recruit visiting the club—takes his role as overseer of the Fly seriously.
As overseers for their respective groups, grad board members need to stay in the know about campus happenings. Connecting with students, whether through email or social events, allows grad boards to gauge changes in campus life and cater their aid to undergraduates’ specific concerns.
Describing the Oak Club, its graduate board president John F. Welch ’10 says that it’s “a pretty self-sufficient undergrad organization.” He credits that characteristic to the club’s relative newness (it was founded in January of 2005).
Students have “the flexibility to shape the club and to craft the club in a way they think is the best manifestation [during] the time they’re there,” Welch adds. The Oak’s graduate board supports that elasticity by advising the undergraduate leadership on budgetary planning for events, for instance.
The HSA Alumni Graduate Board formalizes its connection to its undergraduate unit through similar mingling events. Nathaniel S. Rakich ’10, a former Crimson editorial writer and current HSA graduate board president, believes that one of the board’s goals is to bring people closer together. “That means alums to alums, and current students, and that involves a lot of membership,” he says. The alumni group, officially founded in 2012, now hosts alumni weekends, multiple mixers, and an annual banquet.
Final clubs typically hold at least yearly reunion meetings that help bring graduates and undergraduates together. Additionally, Sears and Powers both agree that having a local grad board president helps the undergraduates and alumni in their clubs stay on the same page and keep updated on the changing face of undergraduate life.
“A number of clubs in the past...had a president who was in New York,” Powers says. “It’s good for fundraising if that’s where most of your donors have tended to be. But the guy becomes like the Great Oz. No one knows him. No one sees him.”
Andrew S. Birsh ’78, graduate board president of the Phoenix Club, and Kenneth G. Bartels ’73, graduate board president of the A.D. Club, declined to comment for this story. Spee Grad Board President Arthur C. Anton Jr. ’81 said that the graduates, alumni, and undergraduates at the club work together, but declined to comment further, citing the private nature of the club’s policies and procedures.
Members and alumni of all female final clubs, the Bee Club, the Isis Club, the Pleiades Society, La Vie Club, and the Sablière Society, declined to comment for this story, citing their no press policies. The oldest of the five, the Bee, was founded in 1991.
Grad boards can have a tangible influence on their members lives’ even outside the confines of undergraduate organizations. Serving almost as an unofficial extension of the Office of Career Services, grad boards provide opportunities for professional advancement and access to a vast alumni network.
Cary A. Williams ’16, president of Association of Black Harvard Women, dedicated her term to reinvigorating ABHW’s relationship with its alumnae. This year, the organization formed a “grad committee” to promote alumnae outreach and mentorship. According to Williams, having alumnae as mentors allows ABHW to transcend the four-year undergraduate experience.
Before ABHW’s 40th anniversary took place this past March, the undergraduate board made a huge effort to have alumnae come back and reconnect. “We want to make sure [alumnae] have a stake in what the organization is right now and not just come back for the sake of reliving their years as an ABHW undergrad, but really feeling like ABHW’s remaining relevant,” Williams explains.
Williams’s comments point to the ever-changing nature of student organizations, which see their memberships fluctuate and needs change every year.
For the Seneca, the professional development side of a grad board was built into the group’s mission.
“It was important to the Seneca founders that something women started having access to was a strong alumnae community that can help not just with the social aspects, but also with professional ones,” Anne F. Wenk '15 says.
Some grad boards of older clubs are very professionally well-connected. Paul J. Zofnass ’69, a member of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources and former member of the Hasty Pudding Club’s board of directors, says he once came to a Pudding grad board member to ask if he knew any contacts at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, an investment firm. The grad board member happened to know all three partners.
“Inheritance and genealogy I think are far less important today than it was in the 60s, and probably going back for hundreds of years at Harvard before that—but clearly the clubs open up all kinds of doors,” Zofnass says.
Zofnass is fond of tying his experiences into what he sees as larger points about human psychology. In general, he says that grad board members of clubs look out for their own and try to help undergraduates where they can.
“Whenever you are a member of an organization, almost any organization, you develop a natural affinity for the people there, and you are proud, hopefully, to be part of that organization,” Zofnass says. “You therefore tend to go out of your way to be helpful for people in any situation where you think you can be helpful for them, or give them a break, or make an introduction for them, or put in a positive word for them.”
Grad board advice also addresses specific problems that a group’s undergraduate leadership may be facing at any given time.
Oftentimes, that perspective is useful when Harvard’s resources fall short. “Our mission is to serve and empower the black woman at Harvard,” Williams emphasizes. “While support from the College at large is always appreciated, there’s something special and really valuable about having those people who share this specific experience reaching back and sharing what was so valuable to them.”
Alvin F. Gordián-Arroyo ’17, president of Fuerza Latina, also sees grad boards as a valuable resource. Outside of having a “strong connection” with undergraduates, Gordián-Arroyo notes that alumni are particularly well-suited to work with issues facing the Latino community at Harvard.
“Especially within the Latino community, a lot of individuals are low-income, first-gen[eration], may not have a lot of connections,” he says. “The alumni association’s goal is to provide a bit of that sense of familia. If you need a job over the summer, and you can’t find one, we’ll hook you up. If you need a place to stay, for your parents to stay over graduation because they’re coming and they can only afford a ticket and not a hotel, we got you covered as well.”
Gordián-Arroyo envisions the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance, recognized by the Harvard Alumni Association this past February, as a “network of communication” that will put students in touch with contacts that they might not have been able to get otherwise. It marks the first instance of a single centralized group that connects Latino alumni and students at the College and Harvard’s graduate schools, says Dorothy Villarreal ’15, co-chair of Concilio Latino. In order to be recognized by the HAA, they had to gather at least 50 signatures. Concilio Latino, a group that provides administrative structure to the College’s Latino groups, Latino alumni, and other students, managed to collect over 500.
“I thought it was really important to try and speak with the alums to try and create that involvedness, because I feel like I’ve put a lot of my time and dedication to the community here at Harvard, and I’m about to graduate,” says Villarreal. “I didn’t just want for it to leave and disappear.”
The assistance that grad boards provide to undergraduates ranges from broadly structural issues to more specific instances concerning individual students. On the social front, even grad boards of unrecognized social clubs often become involved when undergraduates run into trouble with the administration.
“If there is a problem with any of the organizations, typically we will call on their alumni leadership as well, their governance boards to talk about whatever the issue is,” says Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. “They’re very eager to help to make sure their members are compliant with undergraduate regulations.”
“When something goes wrong, grad boards are also very involved because they understand, from a liability perspective, they have skin in the game,” says an undergraduate president of a social club who was granted anonymity because speaking to The Crimson is against his club’s rules. “If there is a lawsuit, at this point in my life, I don’t have a lot to give. Whereas certain grad board members are, financially at least, where the gold is. They do have a lot at stake.”
Some administrators have expressed concern about the role of these traditions in undergraduate social life. For one, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who has publicly voiced his apprehension towards final clubs and other single-gender social organizations, pushes students to think critically about all groups’ practices. “We really want to encourage our community to really think carefully about those taken for granted practices that often got handed down to them and are mindlessly reproduced without any interrogation about what does it do for the mission of our college,” Khurana says.
At least every year, administrators meet with students from Harvard’s unrecognized social clubs to primarily go over rules surrounding hazing, drinking, and sexual assault. Grad boards are often invited to these meetings. Khurana plans to meet with the grad board members of final clubs on May 4, according to a copy of an email invitation obtained by The Crimson.
At times, administrators even go into club houses to provide specific programming to a club and talk with its grad board representatives.
“Over the years, I have gotten to know various members of graduate boards of the clubs,” says Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich. “The way we think about graduate boards, whether it’s for a recognized or unrecognized group, is that these are alumni who have been invested in these organizations over time. Our hope is that they’re going to encourage these kinds of experiences for undergraduates that align with not only the policies, but the values and priorities of the institution.”
Some grad board presidents are very well aware of Harvard’s administrative structures and benefit from that relationship. Powers says that over the years he has developed a relationship with administrators at Harvard, including University Police Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley. This relationship proved useful a few years ago, Powers says, when he received a tip from HUPD that the Cambridge Police Department would be patrolling Mt. Auburn very closely on the first weekend of the academic year. Powers suggested that the undergraduates just get a keg and do a members-only event, rather than risk any incident with the police.
Overall, Powers says it’s the grad board that can offer input on how clubs can stay out of trouble.
“One of the things the grad board exists for is to give a long term perspective and to see the dangers that can come with certain behaviors,” Powers says.
Some grad boards oversee the formative stages of their clubs’ membership and rules governing the club. Beyond helping their members plan punch events, social club grad boards designate certain students that the club must admit.
In 1993, Fly undergraduates voted 28-0 with one abstention for the club to admit women. The grad board took a vote on the matter and said that a co-ed punch could happen the next fall. By that time, the consensus for the decision had vanished, and many of the people propagating the change had graduated. The Fly continues to only punch males.
After the death of MIT first-year Scott S. Krueger at his fraternity house in 1997, many grad boards tightened restrictions on their guest policies. When undergraduates didn’t follow the rules, there were consequences. In 1999, the Spee’s grad board changed the locks on the club’s building when undergraduates were found violating the no-guest policy. That same year, the Owl Club temporarily shut its door to members, much to the bewilderment of even the undergrad president at the time.
Today, grad boards primarily see themselves as advisory boards, but a few do have direct influence on the club’s composition.
“No undergrad club likes to be told what to do,” says the social club president. “They don’t like to be told who to take. They don’t like to be told when to have events. They don’t like that general feeling.”
In his club, he claims, the grad board tells the undergrad president to admit two to three specific people out of every punch class. Sometimes they are legacies, sometimes friends of grad board members, and sometimes the connection is entirely elusive, the social club president says.
At the Fly, Powers says that all legacies, defined as the grandson, son, or brother of a member, are punched. He says that the undergraduate leadership in the club doesn’t have to admit legacies, but that a legacy who wants to join the Fly rarely does not get elected.
“My understanding with the undergrads is, if you are having an issue with a legacy, if you may not want to elect him, let me know, because I’ll be hearing from his brother, his father,” Powers says. “He won’t be happy, so I need to know that.”
Powers says that year to year the number of legacies in the club varies. This year, Powers say that six of the roughly 20 members admitted were legacies.
In addition to playing a role in punch, Powers says that the grad board negotiated new, written rules for the undergraduates this semester, primarily centered around defining what constitutes a party, which would require a doorman and a guest list. Fly members may collectively have up to around 20 guests over to the club without writing up a guest list and may have one party per 10 academic calendar days, Powers says.
Additionally, Powers says that if the undergraduates want to go co-ed, they must take a vote on the issue and receive two-thirds support for two years in a row.
Zofnass says that he doesn’t know how much grads come into play with shaping the makeup of the Hasty Pudding Club now, but when he was an undergrad, it was not uncommon for grads of the club to leverage for undergraduates they knew. Andrew L. Farkas ’82, chairman and “Grand Sphinx” of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, could not be reached for comment.
“It was pretty normal that a former member would call the current president and say, ‘Hey, I know this fellow. I know his family. He’s a good person. You really ought to go after him or punch him,’” Zofnass says.
At the Fox, Sears says grad board members may make suggestions to undergraduates about which students to punch, but it is ultimately up to the under- graduates to decide who is admitted.
Wenk says that at the Seneca, the undergraduate membership is left entirely up to the undergraduates.
Back at HSA Headquarters, home of dated and recent copies of Let’s Go and class ring orders, HSA president Patrick F. Scott ’16 says HSA prides itself on having students set the organization’s tone.
After clarifying that HSA’s grad board is “not a governing body,” Scott continues, “most of [the grad board members] would recognize that ultimately, it’s about students, and that students aren’t really going to get the same experience if they’re not given the free reign to do what they want.”
Jacob T. Bradt ’16, undergraduate president of the Oak, agrees that its grad board has less of a “prescriptive role” than what he believes other undergraduate clubs might have. “It’s really kind of a mutualistic relationship in that both the undergraduate board and the alumni board are really trying to help each other out in any way possible,” he says.
Fostering relationships between undergraduates and grad boards will, according to Villarreal, leave a lasting legacy on Harvard’s institutional memory. “The [HLAA] is going to have a really great impact on students that need that extra help,” she explains. “[Alumni] can also take a bigger role in trying to advocate where we don’t have the time to.”
On some level, grads and undergraduates  in a club can even become friends.
“Mostly, people come to you for career advice and contacts looking for a job.... But you become friends with all these people and there’s life advice too,” says Mitchell L. Dong ’75, a member of the Fly Club’s graduate board and a member of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources. “They’ll come to you with, ‘Oh I’m breaking up with my girlfriend’ or ‘I’m thinking of getting married’ or ‘I’m thinking of moving to New York, or LA, or China,’ or ‘What do you think about going into private equity versus going into tech?’”
By nature, grad boards exist to serve undergraduates. The balance between the undergraduates’ day-to-day operations and the grad boards’ long-term vision requires constant attention. At heart, though, grad boards and undergraduates forge alliances that stem from a shared allegiance to the same organization.
“Even though there is diversity within the organization, we’re all bound by a common mission and common values,” says Bari M. Schwartz ’07, graduate board president of the Seneca and a former Crimson writer.
Despite the sometimes poorly delineated dynamics of their relationship, grad boards and undergraduates work through some underlying tensions, generational differences, and conflicting interests to develop powerful, collaborative organizations that thoroughly influence undergraduate life.
“Alumni have a role in reminding the undergraduates of the traditions of the club and the fact that it is owned in large part by the people currently in the undergraduate organization,” says Welch. “That’s the lifeblood of it, but there’s a lot of other people who have left there that still look very fondly upon their time at the club and have a stake in its reputation and its continued success.”

Finding time to date while leading the high-pressure life of a Harvard student can be quite the ordeal. Between sleeping in section and not doing the reading, it can be hard to squeeze in an evening out with your squeeze. And then, there are monetary concerns. Dates are hella expensive, and you’ve got to save up for that handle of Rubinoff you hate that you’re going to be drinking this weekend. Luckily, FM has done the legwork for you, and discovered the premier BoardPlus- friendly date locations for the starving college student. Or, uh, we did our best.
LAMONT CAFÉ AND BARKER CENTER CAFÉ
Notoriously rife with despair and sadness, Lamont Cafe did not initially seem like a promising spot for a first Board Plus date. Dressed to the nines, we joined the Wednesday afternoon
P-setters and Expos crowd, as well as those students who seem never to leave the fluorescent eatery, just before the dinner rush. We settled at a window table for slightly rubbery Lamont su- shi and awkward small talk. Several “friends” glanced towards and then immediately away from us. Things were not off to a great start. Then, a stroke of fortune: We found out that Lamont of- fers unlimited soy sauce. Date salvaged.
Still looking sharp as a pair of tacks, we took a sunlit stroll across the street to the illustrious Barker café to grab after dinner sweets for our sweets (each other). Peering into the glass display case, we took our pick among the various misshapen pastries that weren’t good enough to be eaten before evening fell. We settled for a piece of bread draped in chocolate. Neither of us wanted to use our hands to eat the pastry, but neither was able to come up with a better alter- native. Bonus points? Our table came pre-equipped with an electric candle to add to the romantic atmosphere.
CHAUHAUS
We texted to arrange the second date before the obligatory three days—we weren’t desperate, just on a deadline. Itching to leave the confines of the Yard, we set out for the mysterious concrete jungle of the Graduate School of Design. The veritable city of poster board and plastic building models obscuring Chauhaus’s entrance made for pleasant pre-date entertainment, and allowed us to pretend to be giant marauders in a tiny abandoned city, always a plus. Inside, Chauhaus looked equally devoid of life—apparently, after 3 p.m. the cafe serves only fruit, leftover pastries, and weird-looking refrigerated sandwiches.
We opted for pastries, and then the Kong (which did not accept BoardPlus).
SEBASTIAN’S CAFE
For those looking to impress dates with their local knowledge, the empire of Board Plus has spread its cheap tendrils far past the Cambridge zip code. Its Bos- ton outpost bears the name Sebastian’s Cafe and has a location just outside of Downtown Crossing. Eager to dine in distant lands and spend some of our parents’ money on a date (over lklten bucks in train fare between the two of us), we set out at what seemed like a reasonable 2 p.m. to grab a late lunch. For Good Friday, this turned out to be unreasonable, and we arrived to find the store locked. We pressed our hungry faces against the glass. It sure looked good in there. Dejected, we left. Date...successful?

This summer, you’ll be furthering your career ambitions; someday you plan to take over the world. In the meantime, best of luck with those Excel spreadsheets/PowerPoint slides/coffee deliveries!
D’s: Doing research in a lab.
You’re a premed or STEM concentrator: practical, hardworking, and eager to make new scientific discoveries. Whether you’re culturing bacteria in a petri dish, calculating the results of your latest survey, or painstakingly measuring out solutions for your titration, you somehow make goggles and a white lab coat look good! Have fun logging hours at your lab this summer, and don’t forget to go outside!

Virginia Woolf sat in the library at Oxford imagining the books that Shakespeare’s sister didn’t publish.
Sometimes when I walk deep in Widener’s belly, I feel the incredible pressure of the books that are not there.
There is a ghost Widener full of books that did not get written.
There is a book I did not write when I put all my energy into not-eating, and there is a book I did not write when I felt weird because I was in love with a girl. There is a book I didn’t write when I was dodging sexual comments, and there is a book I didn’t write when I was feeling inadequate for not receiving sexual comments. There is a book I didn’t write when I was sick with what I thought was love.
There are books that you didn’t write, either.
There are books you didn’t write because you were waiting for someone to make a racist comment, and there were books you didn’t write because someone made a racist comment. There were books you didn’t write because you were trying to figure out if it was really a racist comment and everyone said you were being too sensitive, and you wondered if maybe you were.
There were books you didn’t write because you are sensitive, because of course you are sensitive, because the half-sleights and the full-sleights wear you down and all the books in you start rioting and say: Hey! I am a book! Let me out, let me out of here!
But the book cannot come out because there is no ramp into the building where the book writers are supposed to hang out.
And the book cannot come out because you needed a job and no one told you The Crimson gives federal work-study.
And the book cannot come out because everyone keeps saying you’re a girl and you know you’re not.
And the book cannot come out because you are not the kind of person who writes books.
There are more.
There are books all over the country. There are books in farms and there are books in cities. There are books without pencils or laptops to set them to the page. There are books that will not be accepted by publishers. There are books out of print. There are layers upon layers of unwritten books, books receding forever away from the publishing house, the internet, the library. Beside each Widener, there is a Widener of ghost books, saying I am here, I am here, I am here.
Because feeling is often less valued than calculation, let’s do some math.
Let’s say you and I spent an hour a week in high school not writing books because we felt so weird we were queer.
Let’s say we spent 10 hours a week freshman fall feeling so dumb and unwanted—because we are sluts, because how dare we expect to both fuck and be taken seriously?— that we could not work on our books.
Let’s tally up all the days it was difficult to get out of bed.
Let’s tally up all the time we spent turning to the side, and then to the other side, so we could see our bellies in the mirror every morning before showering: grabbing our thighs, grabbing our other thighs, doing it again. Five minutes a day for 10 years.
Let’s tally up all the times we were hit, and worried about it.
Let’s tally up all the times we were hit, and worried about the person who did it.
Add up the bullshit. I don’t mean the time spent with family or lovers or friends. I don’t mean the hours you spent watching Netflix in bed, the hours you spent kissing, the hours you prayed, the hours you spent saying fuck homework and smoking weed by the Charles with your roommates from freshman year.
I don’t mean any of that. I mean the hours you spent not-writing because you were preoccupied with being the kind of person who can’t or shouldn’t or who isn’t able to or can’t afford to write books.
Add it up.
Say it takes 20 minutes to write a page. Say you can write three pages in an hour. In a hundred hours you have a book.
How many books could you have written?
How many books are here right now, pushing against the heads of their authors, unable to emerge?
How many books sit in that ghost Widener, points of imponderable gravity, refracting light, calling I am a book. I am a book. You don’t see me, but you feel the weight of my absence. And I am here, I am here, I am here.

UPDATED: April 19, 2015, at 10:46 a.m
It’s Wednesday afternoon and a group of library staff members have gathered for an important vote. Carefully examining the entries, they mark down votes on a ballot which includes categories from “wittiest/punniest” and “most resembles a book,” to “most inedible.” This is Lamont Library’s first edible book contest since 2009 (though I will come to see that both the “book” and “edible” requirements are really more like loose guidelines), a celebration of the scholarly and scrumptious. Lamont’s contest is an incarnation of the Edible Book Festival, an annual competition for “bibliophiles, book artists, and food lovers around the world,” according to the website.
“Really the only rule to the contest is that it has to be book-related and made out of completely edible parts,” says Carie McGinnis, a preservation librarian from Houghton Library and one of the organizers of this year’s moveable feast. “From there, you can really take it in any direction.”
McGinnis, who has participated in edible book contests since she was in library school, emphasizes the friendly atmosphere of the bibliophile bake-off. “When you describe [the contest], it might seem a little intimidating, but then you come and see it and you’re like, ‘Oh, I could do that,’” says McGinnis.
The entries this year range from origami seaweed creations to masterful fondant manipulations to flatly inedible puns (“A Tale of Two Chilies” is eloquent in its brevity: It’s two peppers sitting on a tray). Armies of bicolored marshmallow treats clash amidst barbecue sauce “blood” and twisted Twizzler entrails (“War and Peeps”) next to a layered confection drizzled in butterscotch sauce (“Banana Kreperenina”). Nearby, all seven Potter books are recreated in visual, edible puns, from “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone Fruit” all the way down to the “Deathly Marshmallows.”
I soon learn that the seemingly uncomplicated competition is fraught with debate: While some entries are “more aesthetic,” says McGinnis, others are meant to be consumed by voters. And of course, there’s the question of whether to prioritize a punny title or actually attempt to resemble a book. “That is a debate you could really get into,” muses one onlooker, examining the block of bread and jam that is “Game of Scones.”
Unsurprisingly, the delightfully disgusting “War and Peeps” sweeps the competition, taking home Wittiest/Punniest and Best Interpretation of a Classic. But Best in Show is a surprise challenger, a bunny rabbit cake festooned with coconut and frosting: “The Red Velveteen Rabbit.” For disappointed baker and booklovers, there’s always next year. McGinnis has high hopes for the competition’s future.
“It’s a good way to engage the Harvard community and have a lot of fun, and we’re hoping it’s something that grows a little bit,” she says. In addition to drawing more undergrads to both the baking and voting sides—this year’s entries were about half and half from undergraduate confectioners and library chefs—McGinnis says that future competitions might include research librarians on hand to answer any library-related questions. “We want to give this a fresh infusion of blood and energy,” she says.
And of course, there are always more puns to explore. On a blackboard at one end of the room is a wish list of ideas for next year: “The Brothers Caramelov,” “The Origin of Spices,” “Goodnight Moonpie,” and my personal favorite, “Frankenslice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former United Nations Security Council president and Singaporean diplomat Kishore Mahbubani argued that the U.S. needs to begin considering a world in which China is the primary superpower at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum’s annual Albert H. Gordon lecture Wednesday night.
In the address—titled “What Happens When China Becomes Number One?”—Mahbubani drew on his personal experience in diplomacy to discuss the U.S.-China relationship and the future of international politics in light of China’s political and economic rise. He said the U.S. must start acting more responsibly in the international arena to prevent China from acting recklessly in the future.
“It’s time for the U.S. to think about a world in which it is No. 2 and how its interests will change. If the U.S. wants China to act in line within international rules, the best way to do that is through your deeds,” he said. “The question is, would the U.S. feel comfortable living in a world where China behaves as the U.S. behaves when it’s the sole superpower?”
Mahbubani said talking to an American audience about his criticisms of American foreign policy and the possibility of decline relative to China initially daunted him.
“The hard part here is to tell an American audience that the rest of the world often sees the U.S. acting in its own interest at the expense of global interest,” he said. “The U.S. has been unwise in undermining global institutions because every action the U.S. takes to undermine these institutions will be copied by China.”
Mahbubani also speculated that, unlike the U.S., China will not seek to spread its form of government to other countries if it becomes a primary superpower.
“The Chinese don’t have the aspiration to prove that communism’s right. They would just like to revive Chinese civilization,” he said. “The heart of aspirations of Chinese people is to move away from an era of humiliation to an era of being proud of what Chinese civilization can accomplish.”
Despite his criticisms of U.S. and Chinese foreign policy, Mahbubani praised both countries for maintaining stability in their relationship.
“The U.S. has been remarkably benign toward China. Even after Tiananmen in 1989, when the U.S.-China relationship could have taken a nosedive, it didn’t,” he said. “Historians will ask in the future why the U.S. was so generous to the number one emerging power.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2009, 40 percent of Harvard Law School’s entering class, according to data provided the school’s Admissions Office, arrived directly from their senior year of college, maybe even still sporting the odd T-shirt from last year’s big rivalry football game.
It was the continuation of a years-long trend: From 2005 to 2009, between 39 and 45 percent of each incoming class were just recently undergraduates, with the remainder having spent at least one year working or studying elsewhere. But the next year, in 2010, the young students matriculating straight from undergrad only constituted 28 percent of the entering Law School class. More than two-thirds had post-graduate experience.
The change was not a fluke. When Martha L. Minow assumed her position as the new dean of the Law School in July of 2009, priorities, at least in the admissions process, shifted.
“When I became dean, I directed our admissions team to give extra weight to applicants with experience since college,” Minow wrote in an email.
Now, since after 2009, roughly three-fourths of each incoming class of Harvard Law students comes to campus having spent some time beyond their college campuses. It’s a change Minow and Jessica L. Soban ’02, chief admissions officer at the Law School, broadcast as a way to enhance the Harvard Law School experience for students, allowing them to cultivate a better sense of their interests and bring a more experienced perspective to the classroom.
Professors, deans, and students at the Law School largely corroborate this claim, and for the next generation of students the message is increasingly clear: If you want to go to Harvard Law School, it is a pretty good idea—if not an absolute necessity—to get a job first.
AN ACTIVE PREFERENCE
For Soban, a former Crimson business editor who has served as chief admissions officer at the Law School since 2012, the emphasis on work experience has shaped the way her office approaches admissions to the school.
“[Work experience] is something we actively preference and look for in the application process,” she said.
In addition to reaching out more to employers and adjusting the rhetoric at information sessions for undergraduates, the Law School has launched new initiatives aimed at bringing an older and more experienced group of students to the school each year.
In 2013, the school launched its Junior Deferral program, in which Harvard College juniors can apply to the Law School under the condition that, if they are accepted, they work for at least two years before coming back to campus. Soban said the launch of the program, which is still in its pilot stage, was “100 percent” part of the effort to bring students to the Law School already having worked for a few years.
Though these recent efforts may indicate otherwise, Soban maintained that winning admission into the Law School is not necessarily more difficult for students coming straight from college.
“For someone who doesn’t have work experience, it’s not harder per se,” Soban said. “But I want to see in an application that you have those same characteristics, and you have that kind of experience and focus, and not that Law School is a default option for you.”
She also said that she encourages students admitted straight out of college to make use of the school’s deferral policy, which allows them to defer attendance a year or two in “almost every situation requested,” Soban wrote in an email.
Soban emphasized that the time between college and Law School is not a “gap year”—she said she wants to see applicants “actually engaging in active employment, or in active graduate study.”
But for others involved in the admissions process, including  Richard J. Lazarus, one of the Law School professors who reviews admissions files and approves admissions, this preference for work experience can boost an applicant’s chance for success.
“At some point, I’ll start to discount the GPA, or I’ll start to discount the LSAT, because I actually see that they’re very serious about what it is, and they’re not just writing an essay,” Lazarus said. “Anyone can write an essay.”
BEYOND ADMISSION
Employment is not just an advantage in the admissions process; once applicants become students, Law School professors, students, and deans maintain that the benefits of having worked for a few years endure, both in the classroom setting and in the pursuit for a job in the law.
For Law School professor Richard H. Fallon, the difference between students with and without work experience is noticeable: He said that in his experience, “disproportionately the students that I have thought the best and most interesting were students who had some time out.”
“It’s not that this is an absolute necessity for being a first-rate law student, but my experience suggests that it’s a help,” Fallon added.
Work experience can also give students an edge in finding employment after their three years of legal studies, according to Alexa Shabecoff, the Law School’s assistant dean for public service.
“You’re just more more marketable to employers if you have work experience,” she said.
For Mark A. Weber, the assistant dean for career services, the benefit of having worked a few years is less that it gives students an advantage—he maintained that Harvard Law students do well “irrespective” of their previous experience—but that allows students to find a better sense of where exactly they plan to work.
“The real reason, I think it's better for our students to have some time away, it gives them a better perspective, a better perspective as they're exploring their options,” he said.
“They have more of a crystallized focus of what they want to do and why they are here,” he added.
A SENSE OF PURPOSE
For Soban and current Law School students, working for a couple of years proves to be an important to shape a sense of purpose for the graduate degree. But in addition to ensuring the Law School does not become a “default option,” students said it has allowed them to better balance the application process and avoid “burnout.”
C. Taylor Poor ’12, a second-year Law School student and pre-law tutor in Eliot House, worked for a mental health advocacy organization for a year prior to law school.
“I think the biggest help for me...was that it gave me kind of a reason to keep going, and a very specific person for why I was at law school,” she said. When she advises students, Poor said she emphasizes the value of this sense of purpose, which often, but not necessarily, arrives after having worked and explored for a few years.
“You don't need law school,” she said. “Law school is a deliberate choice.”
For Taylor A. C. Lane ’11, who is a first-year Law School student and a pre-law tutor in Leverett House, said that work experience helped her to gauge the necessity of the law school degree to achieve her career goals.
“It really tested how much I wanted to go back to law school. And so I think that was very healthy—law school is a big investment. It's a pre-professional school,” she said.
Katherine A. Divasto ’16, a Harvard undergraduate who said that she plans to attend law school but not necessarily Harvard’s, said taking time away from academic pursuits will help her focus on her studies now and her application later.
“I worry that if I were to go straight on it would be a little bit too much,” she said.

A federal jury found Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev guilty Wednesday on a slate of charges in connection with the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, including many that carry the death penalty.
The string of guilty verdicts on the 30-count indictment closed one chapter and opened another, as Tsarnaev will now face the same jury once more with the federal death penalty on the line. There is no death penalty in Massachusetts, but Tsarnaev was convicted of federal charges.
On Wednesday afternoon, Harvard affiliates reacted to the rulings, which were delivered just short of two years after the bombings at the Marathon that killed three people: former Business School employee Krystle Campbell, Boston University graduate student Lu Lingzi, and 8-year-old Martin Richard of Dorchester. The bombings and subsequent manhunt for Tsarnaev and his late older brother wreaked havoc in Greater Boston and Cambridge.
Savanna M. Arral ’16, who was close to the site of the bombings when they took place, said she is “very happy” with the jury’s decision.
“I think that the most important thing about the verdict is that it’s going to give closure to all of the people that were affected by this. They needed this,” she said. “I think this is the end of a long road for a lot of people.”
David Luberoff, a senior project advisor to the Radcliffe Institute’s Boston Area Research Initiative, said the Boston Marathon bombings have become a defining moment for the city and “part of the tapestry of Boston.” In a course that Luberoff instructs, U.S. in the World 24: "Reinventing Boston: The Changing American City,” students reflect on legacies of the bombing, including the “Boston Strong” movement that emerged from it.
Sarah R. Siskind ’14, a former Crimson columnist who entered the race informally to help a friend, said she is pleased that the case was conducted “so dispassionately” through a judicial process.
“If anything, hopefully this case lends a little bit more confidence into the American judicial system,” Siskind said.
Commonwealth officials also reacted to the rulings. Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 said at a press conference Wednesday that he agrees with the jury’s decision.
“Certainly based on everything I saw, I have no problem with it. I think at this point it’s up to the jury to make the decision about what happens next,” he said. Baker added that he would support the death penalty for Tsarnaev.
“I said last year that for a crime like this I would support the death penalty. I continue to, but obviously this is a decision that gets made by the jury,” Baker said.
In a statement issued Wednesday, Attorney General of Massachusetts Maura T. Healey ’92 called the decision “a just verdict.”
“At a time of great tragedy, we were reminded of the strength of this community which showed the world that those who seek to do us harm will not triumph here,” the statement read.
Tsarnaev will soon face a second phase of his trial in which a jury will decide whether to sentence him to death. Martha M. Coakley, a former attorney general of Massachusetts and a fellow at the Institute of Politics, told WCVB-TV on Wednesday that appeals may be expected but can “take years.”
But though the so-called “second phase” of Tsarnaev’s legal process is about to begin, Erick M. Juarez ’15, who was close to the site of the bombings when they happened, called the guilty rulings “another step forward.”
“Regardless of whether or not he receives a death penalty, I don’t think it will make too much of a difference,” he added. “I’m really happy that justice was served, but no amount of justice is going to be enough to compensate for the lives of the victims.”

Harvard’s total number of junior faculty hires has reached gender parity across the University for the first time ever, according to Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, amid what she called “a conscious effort on the part of the University” to increase faculty diversity.
Thirty-one of the 62 new junior faculty who joined Harvard in the 2014-2015 academic year were women, and 24 percent of the new hires were minorities, according to a report released by the University-wide Office for Faculty Development and Diversity.
“The fact that it’s at that level is remarkable,” Singer said, referring to the gender parity reached in junior hires.
Women constituted 36 percent of the 47 new junior faculty entering Harvard  in 2013-2014, according to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
Singer attributes the shift over the past decade in the percentage of minorities and women in the faculty to deliberate attempts by administrators to ensure the potential candidates come from as wide a pool as possible and that all people involved in the search process seek to mitigate any unconscious biases that may affect hiring.
These latest hires bring the total number of tenured and tenure-track faculty to 1,572, two fewer than last year but up 115 from 10 years ago. Of this University-wide group, 438, or 28 percent, are women, and 334, or 21 percent, are minorities.
Within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, offers for tenured and tenure-track faculty are currently at gender parity, according to Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser. At the time of comment, she did not know the percentages of women among junior hires who accept these offers.
Faculty members responded positively to news that junior hires have reached gender parity but said that, overall, reaching equal gender representation in all of Harvard’s faculty is a distant goal.
“I think that’s great,” Physics professor Vinothan N. Manoharan said. “Our faculty, though, still is overwhelmingly male, and so I think we still have a long ways to go.”
History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy said Harvard should not settle for what he called a “huge milestone” in achieving gender parity at the junior hire level but should seek gender parity for tenured faculty members as well.
McCarthy, who is also a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government, added that Harvard must continue to be “vigilant” when hiring and especially granting tenure to faculty members.
“In the long term it doesn't do us as much good if we’ve arrived at gender parity at the level of the hire, but if there are huge disparities in terms of gender inequalities at the level of tenuring,” McCarthy said.
Katherine J. Hinde, an assistant professor of Human Evolutionary Biology, said providing resources for faculty from underrepresented populations is also important to ensure a diverse community on campus.
“What we need to ensure is that the opportunities and experiences are equal," Hinde said, "[and] that certain demographics aren’t more likely to be marginalized or burdened with disproportionate service” once they are on campus as faculty members.
Singer said she thinks the overall increase in diversity in Harvard’s faculty is necessarily predicated by an increase in women and minority representation among junior hires.
“What you’ll note is that both of the those percentages [of minority and women hires] are larger than the corresponding percentages amongst the junior faculty,” Singer said. “That’s the only way to change things. You’ve got to bring in people who are more diverse than the existing stock of people in order to actually change the situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 9, 2015, at 11:16 p.m.
In a two-hour discussion with administrators on Wednesday, students raised concerns about student privacy in advance of the Bureau of Study Counsel’s move back to the purview of Harvard College.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced Monday that, after 11 years as part of Harvard University Health Services, the BSC will report administratively to the College starting in July.
About 30 students and faculty members attended Wednesday's town hall event, some of whom expressed worries about a potential loss of privacy, as the Bureau’s transition from UHS to the College means a different set of guidelines for confidentiality.
Currently, as part of UHS, the Bureau is subject to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act which “protects the privacy of individually identifiable health information,” according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website. When the BSC rejoins the College, students’ records and other private information will again fall under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a different kind of protection that previously applied to the Bureau before the move to UHS 11 years ago, administrators said at the meeting.
“We’re moving from a healthcare notion of privacy to an educational definition,” Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education for Academic Support Ann Gaylin said.
Some students are concerned about losing the protection of HIPAA, raising issues about the potential differences between medical and academic privacy privileges.
William A. Greenlaw ’17, an Undergraduate Council representative, said he also wondered how the BSC’s move would affect student comfort levels in expressing their problems, academic or otherwise. Greenlaw asked whether moving the BSC to the College would mean that students could not, for example, disclose cheating on an exam when discussing stress without risking academic disciplinary action.
Administrators said they have strived to protect students’ best interests and that focus will not change with the BSC’s move.
“We don’t compromise student privacy,” Harris said. “We’re not moving this so we can make things worse.”
Ultimately, administrators said the motivation for the BSC’s move to the College lies with the more flexibility it provides with respect to academic support for students. Without the clinical mandate of hiring licensed physicians, the BSC can take on staff members who may have particular specialties but not medical degrees, she said.
In addition, with the BSC as part of the College, aggregate data about academic life can be shared among offices including the Advising Programs Office and Accessible Education Office to “knit together academic services,” Gaylin said.
“A lot of what we’re looking forward to is an ease of communication,” BSC Director Abigail Lipson said.
In addition to privacy concerns, several students who spoke at the town hall meeting said they were worried that transferring the mental health and certain counseling aspects of the BSC to UHS may deter students from seeking help because of the stigma of going to UHS.
Director of UHS Paul J. Barreira said at the town hall that, even with additional resources and appropriate suggestions, some students will continue not to seek counseling.
Some attendees at the town hall said the BSC, as it now stands, has provided them with a non-clinical space to discuss both traumatic experiences and day-to-day stresses with trusted counselors. The resulting discussion prompted even more questions, and it remains unclear as to what the dividing line will be between academic and mental health issues after the transition.
Craig Rodgers, a counselor at the BSC, said administrators should make sure that the relationships between BSC counselors and their students remain of utmost importance, citing an anecdote about a traumatic car accident in which he, along with a Counseling and Mental Health Services staff member and medical personnel, were called to the scene.
“Students are not just personally devastated [by stress and traumatic events]; they’re academically devastated,” Rodgers said. “I hope that we’re there at the front and center [when students need help].”
The discussion also turned to the decision-making process behind this transition, which came under fire from some who criticized what they saw as a lack of student input.
Jacob R. Steinberg-Otter ’16, a Undergraduate Council representative, criticized what he described as administrators soliciting student comment only after the important decisions have been made.
“We are asked for feedback and not for input,” he said. “My personal frustration is with the change and how it was carried out.”
Administrators responded by saying that an external review was conducted in 2011, and an internal review was conducted in 2012 to gather students’ opinions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 21, 2015, at 4:40 a.m.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force met on Wednesday to discuss the North Allston/North Brighton Housing Stabilization Program, ongoing construction and demolitions at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex and Charlesview apartments, and the renewal of Everett Street.
At the meeting—the first in more than 100 days–Allston residents also brought up perennial concerns about construction workers parking in their neighborhoods.
The task force was created in 2006 and serves as a liaison between Harvard, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, and the residents of the Allston neighborhood of Boston.
BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler and Val Frias, an associate director at the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, presented the task force with an update on the housing program, which is intended to stabilize the Allston housing market by promoting long-term homeownership. The ABCDC will use $3 million contributed by Harvard’s community benefits package, along with an additional up to $5 million in credit from the Boston Community Loan Fund, to buy 13 properties over two years and resell them on the condition that the owners live on their properties as long as they own them.
“One of the great concerns the task force and many in the community had…was the fact that so many properties in the neighborhood are being bought by investors,” Autler said. Allston residents have said that cash-paying investors seeking to rent out properties purchase newly available houses before potential homeowners have the chance to make a bid.
Directly preceding the task force meeting, Autler also presented on the reconstruction of Everett Street. The first phase of the long-awaited project, funded by the City of Boston and a $500,000 contribution from Harvard, will see the installation of new concrete sidewalks, granite curbs, street trees, and stormwater infrastructure from North Beacon Street up to Western Avenue. Autler projected work to start on the project around July.
“I think we have a great opportunity with [the $5.35 million Public Realm] Flexible Fund to look at some of the other improvements that might be made here…[such as] some sort of public art along the street,” Autler said.
Harvard Public Affairs and Communications Associate Vice President Kevin Casey updated Allston residents on construction projects discussed at a recent Allston Construction Mitigation Subcommittee meeting. Casey reported that the foundation of the SEAS complex is currently undergoing enabling work, despite the lack of finalized architectural plans. He added that regulatory and community review is slated for fall 2015, with construction commencing by mid-2016.
Casey also provided an update of the University’s demolition projects in North Allston, reporting that the Brookline Machine demolition was almost complete and that six out of seven Charlesview apartment buildings are already down.
Subcommittee attendees such as Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alford expressed concerns that Harvard’s construction worker parking program, though effective, was not properly enforced. Alford called for checks six times a week, which he said would be far more frequent than the two weekly random spot checks done at the moment.
“We the committee backed off calling [the Boston Transportation Department] so [Harvard’s] program could be enforced,” added subcommittee co-chairman Ed Kotomori, who said residents would now be referring parking violations once again to the BTD. “The tickets are going to start coming every single day—in two hour parking spots, BTD’s going to be there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Newly elected members of the Graduate Student Council declared Wednesday night their support for an effort by graduate students to unionize, just three days after The Crimson first reported the early stages of the movement. The GSC has not officially backed the efforts.
Incumbent GSC Vice President John Gee and Clarisse R. Wells, who was elected representative for the Humanities at large on Wednesday, both announced their support for the union movement during pre-election speeches to graduate student voters. In an interview following the election, Darcy L. Frear, who was elected GSC president, said she personally supports the effort to unionize.
Frear said that before lending official GSC support to the movement, she would like to gauge interest from the student body of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“I heard a lot during the election that a lot of people supported the issue of unionization. I am really interested in it, too, but I do not want to make it our motivation in moving forward in the next year,” she said. “But I would be interested in hearing what everyone has to say about it, and if there is enough interest, I could see us move forward.”
Frear said she envisions a scenario where the GSC would show support for the potential union as the body has with other movements by issuing official statements of support. She added, however, that she can also see the Council playing a more active role in promoting the same causes that the union would support.
For his part, Gee, who said he has been involved in the unionization movement, said he would like to see the GSC back the effort.
“Another thing that has just come up recently in the past week or two is that some students have announced they are having a public unionization campaign,” Gee said during his speech. “GSC does not have any official relationship with that, but it is an issue I think we’ll want to be considering next year, and I would just like to say that I am in favor of supporting that campaign.”
Gee said he sees potential for the union to address issues that a large number of GSAS students face, compared to the Harvard Teaching Campaign, which focuses on problems related to teaching. First-year GSAS students are not ordinarily eligible for TF appointments, and graduate students in the humanities and social sciences are only guaranteed teaching positions in the third and fourth years.
“[The movement to unionize] focuses on more fundamental labor issues of compensation and healthcare and trying to extend the graduate school’s time-off policy for new parents,” he said during his speech.
Wells, the Humanities representative at large, also proclaimed her support for the unionization effort and said she hopes to create a dialogue with graduate students in the humanities to determine their needs.
“I am really happy to extend a hand to everybody and find out what is happening in the humanities,” she said. “Hopefully, we can do a lot to get your feedback on this issue [of the union] to see what, if anything, you want to have done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alex Banayan, a 22-year-old who was called the world’s youngest venture capitalist by Business Insider when he was 19, shared his stories and entrepreneurial strategies in a question-and-answer sponsored by Harvard Ventures, an undergraduate entrepreneurship club, on Wednesday evening.
Banayan urged the audience of around 40 people to pursue the ideas that inspire them and offered tips ranging from interview advice to his own methods for overcoming failure.
“If you’re trying to do really big things, you’re going to fail a lot more than you succeed. The opposite of success is not failure; it’s apathy. It’s not trying,” he said.
Banayan’s venture capital career began in his freshman year at the University of Southern California, with an idea for a book in which successful businesspeople gave advice to the next generation’s entrepreneurs. Then, two days before final exams, Banayan obtained tickets to the game show "The Price Is Right." Instead of studying, he spent the night before the show figuring out how to beat the game. The next day, he said he won a sailboat that he sold for $20,000.
With the money, Banayan began work on his book, which he has spent the past four years writing and will include interviews with Bill Gates, Lady Gaga, and Warren Buffet, among others.
Banayan used the experiences and contacts he gained through writing the book to earn a job at venture capital firm Alsop Louie Partners at age 19.
Speaking from his own experience as a young venture capitalist, he urged members of the audience to see their youth as an asset.
“Being in college is the biggest advantage ever. You’re surrounded by smart people,” he said.
Banayan connected with Harvard Ventures through Alexander A. Wirth ’15, co-founder of political analytics startup Quorum, who met Banayan at a conference.
“I thought it might be interesting for him to come to Harvard and share the experiences he’s collected with students interested in startups,” Wirth said. “He’s our age and can relate to where we’re coming from and the problems we’re facing, but he’s also had professional experience on the VC side.”
Curren A. Iyer ’17, Harvard Ventures director of community events, added, “[Banayan] has the sort of drive that you see a lot at Harvard, so he seemed a natural fit to come here.”
Founded in 2011, Harvard Ventures aims to connect students to the startup and venture capital worlds.
“We want to create the most innovation-friendly environment on campus,” said Ben I. Pleat ’17, Harvard Ventures vice president. “We want to empower students who are trying to start companies.”
For her part, Cindy Han, a member of the audience and a visiting student from Hong Kong, said she “never expected the talk would be so inspiring. He really showed me that if you have an idea, you should just follow it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than an hour before a pre-screening of the upcoming season of HBO show "Game of Thrones," a line of undergraduates clad in crowns and yielding swords formed in the Science Center on Wednesday evening, as they eagerly waited to gain a coveted spot in the lecture hall.
Organized by Harvard Student Agencies in partnership with HBO and Philo, an online television platform free for students at the College, the showing marked the third time that a "Games of Thrones" first episode pre-screening occurred at Harvard prior to its official television season premiere.
According to Philo co-founder Tuan A. Ho ’09, students who arrived early received complimentary "Game of Thrones"-themed crowns.  All students who reserved tickets were also entered into a lottery to receive "Game of Thrones"-themed snow globes, boxed sets of the show on DVD, and cardboard cutouts of characters, he added.
HSA President Patrick F. Scott ’16 said there was excess demand for this year’s event. "We have a limited number of seats people can sign up for online, but even out of those only the first 250 people to arrive get in,” he said.
Among the hundreds of students in line, some avid fans said they looked forward to catch an early glimpse of the show.
“This is the third year we’ve done this,” Lisa M. Massaroni '15 said. “We really enjoy 'Game of Thrones.'”
Alex A. Nesbitt ’15  said that he began binge-watching episodes during winter break. “I watched all of season two a week before season three came out,” Nesbitt said.
Constantin W. Arnscheidt ‘18, who was completing a physics problem set while waiting to enter into the lecture hall, shared a more direct experience with the show.
“My family lives in Northern Ireland, so 'Games of Thrones' actually films next to my town,” Arnscheidt said. “[Last summer] I managed to sneak onto the set for a little bit before I was forcibly removed by security guards who threatened to arrest me.”
The premiere of the fifth season of "Game of Thrones" will air on HBO.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a season-high six goals game from sophomore attack Marisa Romeo, the Crimson (5-5, 3-1 Ivy) fell to No. 4 Boston College (12-2, 4-2 ACC) in Chestnut Hill, Mass., on Tuesday afternoon. The Eagles topped Harvard by six goals, by a final score of 19-13.
Romeo’s seven points came from a tied career-high of six goals and also one assist. All six goals were unassisted, with the sophomore netting five in the second half. In a man-up opportunity midway through the second period, Romeo dished the ball to sophomore attack Megan Hennessey, who found the back of the net to tally her second goal of the game. Earlier in the match, Hennessey capitalized on an assist from junior co-captain midfielder Audrey Todd to close the first-period scoring and close the scoring gap to three notches heading into halftime.
The Crimson failed to grab a lead throughout the match, only tying the score once, 3-3, after a 3-0 BC run in the opening minutes. Freshman midfielder Eliza Guild buried a free position shot in the seventh minute of the first period to level the score, but the Eagles went on to execute a 4-0 run to more than double Harvard’s score in the next ten minutes.
After halftime, the Crimson offense could not string together more than two consecutive goals without allowing one, contributing to the widening scoring gap in the BC squad’s favor. The slowed Harvard offensive effort can be attributed to the Eagles’ edge in draw controls, 22-12, with BC holding possession for the majority of the contest. Hennessey grabbed half of the Crimson’s draws with six.
Despite both teams allowing an equal number of turnovers, 10, the Harvard defense executed 13-of-16 defensive clears, while the Eagles secured perfection, with 8-of-8.
Romeo led both teams with six goals, but BC sophomore midfielder Tess Chandler recorded an Eagles team-high four goals, two coming in the first five minutes that led to a 2-0 lead for the home team early on in the match.
Junior co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis recorded five saves for the Crimson, the highest of any goalie that saw the field. Substituting in for Weis in the final ten minutes, freshman goalie Meredith Brown recorded three saves of her own.
Tallying a team-high two groundballs, junior co-captain Tory Waldstein led the Harvard defense. Sophomore defender Emma Ford saw the offensive third of the field in the final seconds to net the final goal of the match off a free position opportunity, bringing the final score to, 13-19.

Off to its best start through 27 games since 2006, the Harvard baseball team begins Red Rolfe Division play this weekend with four games on the road against Brown before traveling to UMass for the first round of the Beanpot Monday afternoon.
The Crimson enters the weekend 3-5 in Ivy League play, having faced each member of the Ivy League’s Lou Gehrig Division twice. Harvard (14-13, 3-5 Ivy) went 0-4 in its road games against Columbia and Penn, losing by a combined five runs, but bounced back this past weekend by sweeping Princeton on Saturday and splitting its doubleheader with Cornell on Sunday.
“Now is the time of the season where we really need to play our best baseball,” senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan said. “It’s been great so far to have a winning record, but I think that our season and our postseason life are going to come down to these next three weeks. We’re definitely looking to take at least three, hopefully four, games from Brown and put ourselves in the driver’s seat.”
The Crimson bats came alive over the weekend with the offense producing 37 runs on 59 hits in the four games. Freshman infielder John Fallon went 11-for-15 and drove in eight runs, earning Ivy League Player and Rookie of the Week honors.
Starting pitchers Nick Gruener, Matt Timoney, and Sean Poppen each picked up wins on the weekend. That trio, plus senior Tanner Anderson, will start this weekend’s four games for Harvard.
“I think the biggest thing we struggled with [against Columbia and Penn] was getting ahead in the count against the opposite-hand hitters,” Gruener said. “We gave up a lot of hits on 0-2, 1-2 counts. This weekend we pitched really well against hitters from both sides of the plate.”
The pitching staff has posted a 3.57 earned run average in Ivy League play while the offense is hitting .352 while averaging 6.5 runs per game. Fallon is hitting .667 in 18 conference at-bats while captain Ethan Ferreira has posted a .462 mark. Seniors McGuiggan, Mike Martin, and Jack Colton are all hitting above .350 while junior catcher DJ Link leads the team with 10 runs batted in.
No clear favorite has emerged in this year’s Red Rolfe Division, which has been won by Dartmouth each of the past seven seasons. The Big Green currently sits atop the standings, one game up on the Crimson, after splitting all four of its two-game series. Yale and Brown both sit at 2-6.
“We’re fortunate that our side hasn’t been playing as well in Ivy games,” McGuiggan said. “We know that we’re only a game back of Dartmouth and given a good weekend against Brown, then we’ll be in good shape going into the final two weekends.”
The team in each division with the best record after 20 Ivy League games will square off in the Ivy League Baseball Championship, a three-game series to be held at the home field of the team with the better conference record. As division play begins, Harvard has its sights set on the Bears, a team it split its four games with last season in Cambridge.
The Brown offense is averaging three runs per game while posting a .223 team average in Ivy League play. The Bears will give the ball to seniors Eddie Fitzpatrick and Taylor Wright, sophomore Max Ritchie, and freshman Reid Anderson for Alumni Weekend in Providence.
Fitzpatrick picked up the win in Brown’s 4-3 victory over Princeton on March 29. The biggest threat in the Bears’ offense is sophomore outfielder Rob Henry, who leads the team with nine hits and a .310 batting average in Ivy League play.
Harvard will begin its defense of last year’s Beanpot championship on Monday afternoon against the Minutemen (6-10, 5-4 Atlantic 10). The Crimson swept UMass in a doubleheader in Florida over spring break, outscoring the Minutemen, 20-11.
“It’s a special experience for sure,” McGuiggan said. “You get to Harvard hearing about the hockey Beanpot, which is a huge deal here in the Boston area. It’s really important and special for us that we have our own, and it was great last year to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much has changed in the world of men’s volleyball since Harvard and Penn State last squared off for a conference matchup.
Then, in late February, the Crimson walked onto its home court with a chance to wrest control of first place away from the Nittany Lions. Harvard entered with only one league loss and a spot just outside the top 15 in the polls.
At the end of the night, however, the only statistic that mattered was the final one: Penn State 3, Harvard 1.
Now, in early April, there is neither an extended winning streak nor an impressive national ranking. Last weekend, the Crimson dispatched third-place Princeton only to fall to last-place NJIT a day later. The defeat shoved Harvard three games into second place behind Penn State, which holds an undefeated conference record.
For two months and some days, the teams’ narratives have diverged, but they will coincide again on Friday night when the Nittany Lions host the Crimson at Universal Park, Pa.
“If we receive their serve well and pass a good game, we can compete,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “If we don’t, they’re awfully tough.”
As different as the world looks since the last matchup, several important forces remain unchanged. The first force has a name and a title: Aaron Russell, All-American and Nittany Lion outside hitter.
Averaging nearly five kills per set, Russell is the most efficient player on the most efficient offense in the EIVA.
“[Aaron is] probably the best player in the conference and one of the top players in the country,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said.
In Penn State’s first matchup against the Crimson, however, teammate Nick Goodell stole the spotlight, matching a career high of 25 kills, including nine in the deciding set.
On the season, Russell and Goodell have combined for 583 finishes. This offense has propelled the Nittany Lions to nine straight victories heading into Friday’s competition.
In response to this attack, the Crimson will trot out the strongest defense in the league. Led by co-captain Caleb Zimmick, who averages 2.49 blocks per set, Harvard has tallied 182 blocks and 713 digs, the first tops in the EIVA, the latter second.
The Crimson attack is no slouch either, as five players have accumulated more than 100 kills. Co-captain D.J. White and junior outside hitter Branden Clemens lead the squad with 236 and 229 finishes, respectively.
But if the Penn State matchup has the makings of a heavyweight championship, the subsequent contest against St. Francis looks more like a beat-down. The Red Flash is worst in the conference in terms of average kills, blocks, and points won.
Even so it’s hard to blame the Crimson if it approaches the weekend, consciously or not, with a single opponent on its mind. Now ranked No. 7 in the nation, Penn State has not lost to an opponent outside the top 15 all season.
History may belong to the Nittany Lions, but for now at least, Friday night belongs to nobody.
“[Penn State] has beaten a lot of good teams,” Zimmick said. “We know what they bring, but also, reflecting on how we played against them earlier this year…we know that we can compete.”

Your parent or grandparent who has just discovered emojis now has a whole lot more to send you. In the event that you haven’t updated your phone yet, or you weren’t bombarded with texts or Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter posts: new emojis are here!
Looks like Apple has finally watched SNL’s emoji skit and decided to include some politically correct icons (read: ones for different races and same-sex couples and families).
To get to these emojis, hold down on one of the faces or active person (i.e. running, skiing, surfing, etc.), and a range of racially diverse options will pop up. Note that not all of the human emojis have racial options, like the dancing twins and the family emojis.
The interface is a lot more streamlined, including all the emojis in one long scroll. This will presumably make it easier for users to find emojis.
If you’ve gotten over the racially diverse emojis and check out the rest of the scroll, you will notice Apple also does a little shameless plug for its Apple Watch, which, along with two different iPhones, users can find towards the end of the scroll.
Users also can now choose from 42 flags, because obviously users in other countries would be unhappy that they couldn’t show national pride via emojis. So now users can rep #murica and #hongkong at the same time.
Still waiting on ethnic or interracial couples, but this is definitely a good start. Spread the word and update to iOS 8.3 to get the new emoji experience!
