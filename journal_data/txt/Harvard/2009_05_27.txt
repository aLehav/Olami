After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chanequa N. Campbell ’09—one of two Harvard students linked to last Monday’s shooting in Kirkland House—denied any involvement with the incident Tuesday and accused Harvard administrators of unjustly barring her from graduating next month because of her background.Campbell—who lived in the Kirkland Annex where the shooting took place—received two letters last Friday from Harvard administrators informing her that she must leave campus and prohibiting her from attending all graduation activities, according to her lawyer, Jeffrey T. Karp. Campbell has denied any connection to the incident or involvement in dealing drugs to Harvard students, Karp said.Two female Harvard students allowed the victim, 21-year-old Cambridge resident Justin Cosby, and three others involved in the incident to enter Kirkland, according to Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone, Jr. ’85.Last Friday, New York songwriter Jabrai J. Copney, 20, pled not guilty to charges of first-degree murder for the May 18 shooting in Kirkland J-entryway that led to Cosby’s death early the next morning.Copney, along with two unidentified individuals from New York, planned to scam Cosby out of drugs and money in his possession, Leone said, adding that police recovered a pound of marijuana and approximately $1,000 on or near Cosby after he had been shot.Cosby has been linked to drug sales to Harvard students, The Crimson reported last Wednesday, citing multiple text messages sent to Harvard students from a phone registered to Cosby’s mother mentioning marijuana and suggesting that Cosby was engaged in its sale.Karp said that Campbell and Lowell resident Brittany J. Smith ’09 have both been linked to the incident. He said Campbell denied knowing the victim or giving her swipe card—which grants access to Harvard dorms—to anyone that day.“I have no knowledge of anything that happened,” Campbell told the Globe in an interview monitored by her lawyer. “None, whatsoever.”In their communications with Campbell and her attorney, Harvard administrators did not cite specific reasons for their decision to send Campbell off campus and bar her from graduating, simply attributing her removal to “the recent shooting,” Karp said.“She’s been granted no due process, no appeal, nothing,” Karp said.Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Robert P. Mitchell declined to comment on the case Tuesday, citing the ongoing police investigation and Harvard’s policy not to discuss information regarding individual students.Though Campbell said she is stopping short of accusing the University of outright racism, she said she believes she is being “singled out” because of her background.“The honest answer to that is that I’m black and I’m poor and I’m from New York and I walk a certain way and I keep my clothes a certain way,” Campbell told the Globe in response to a question about Harvard’s motivation for acting against her. “It’s something that labels me as different from everyone else.”Karp said that his client has provided authorities with “verifiable alibis,” stating she gave them “an hour by hour, if not a minute by minute” account of her whereabouts that day.The Globe and the Associated Press report that Campbell was taking a final the day of the shooting and suggest that she lived far from the scene of the crime. In fact, Campbell lived only two entryways—about 80 feet—away from where the shooting took place.It is unclear what if any charges Smith, the other Harvard student allegedly involved in the incident, who Karp said is Copney’s longtime girlfriend, faces from the University or law enforcement. Smith could not be reached for comment Tuesday. —Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics Professor Martin S. Feldstein ’61 will step down after 22 years on the board of directors at American International Group, an embattled international insurance company that has received billions in government bailout funding.
Feldstein declined to comment on why he will not stand for re-election at the company’s annual general meeting on June 30.
“I never discuss AIG,” Feldstein wrote in an email.
The insurance giant, which has received $182.5 billion in government funding since September, has been under pressure to overhaul its board, according to media reports.
The company announced six new nominees to its board on May 19. According to the Washington Post, at least five of the nominees were selected by the company’s federally-appointed trustees.
“We’ve spent considerable effort focused on AIG’s board of directors,” AIG trustee Douglas L. Foshee said during a May 13 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. “We’ve come to the conclusion that if AIG is to succeed, it needs a fresh start.”
Feldstein’s exit comes as the last in a series of departures of veteran directors at AIG. The company’s recently-appointed Chairman and CEO Edward M. Liddy and long-time directors Stephen F. Bollenbach and James F. Orr have all announced that they will step down.
“I am the last of the directors from before 2000 to leave,” Feldstein wrote in an e-mail. “But it is time for the new team to carry on.”
During his time on AIG’s nine-member board of directors, Feldstein served on the board’s finance and risk management committee as well as the regulatory, compliance, and public policy committee.
“He is a brilliant and important economist who has contributed significantly over many decades to the understanding of the public sector,” said Economics Professor Edward L. Glaeser of Feldstein.
Feldstein, who was chief economic adviser to President Reagan and former president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, currently serves as an adviser to President Obama on the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
“There are always new activities,” Feldstein wrote, “and this will certainly give me more time for other things.”
