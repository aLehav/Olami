The first thing I noticed when I arrived at the Harvard T stop was the soothing notes of Bach’s “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring.” Although barely audible above the screech of the trains, the soft guitar music nevertheless drifted throughout the station, providing a sense of peace and calm to a usually hectic scene.

Comfortably hidden in plain sight on the platform was a timid-looking older man. Surrounded by a few CDs and a cup of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee, he played—with a look of serenity befitting the music—a small guitar attached to an even smaller amp. As passersby smiled on their way to the oncoming train, he smiled back politely, continuing to play the classical tune with facile skill.
  His name is Peter Podobry, and his demeanor is as gentle as his music. Speaking softly and interspersing his words with notes on the guitar, he tells me of his background, his musical training, and his thoughts about America with a wry smile. “So I came from Russia, around 20 years ago,” he explains. “I came already as a musician, and I decided to play some on the street. I play in other places too—restaurants, clubs, etc.—but sometimes I like to play on the T.”
  His choice of classical music isn’t so surprising upon hearing his academic background. “I studied music at a four year school in Russia…so I’m kind of an educated guy,” he says, before laughing and clarifying, “Not guy… man!”
“I was a musician in Russia, and I used to play [at] the Black Sea,... commercial stuff on the beaches,” he says as he strums a few chords. But it was apparently not all fun and leisure. For a few months in 1985, he spent time in a Russian jail. “There’s a lot of story around my immigration,” he says softly, then perks up, “but that’s not why you’re here!” Another playful guitar strum.
 Throughout our talk, Podobry espoused a sense of unassuming optimism that was contagious. He admits that there have been tough times, but remains cheerful. “Now here I am! And here you are!” He says as he motions to his Dunkin’ cup as a literal example to look at life “half-full.” With coffee and an audience, he says, “Today’s my lucky day!” As another train approached, he smiled again and began to play Eric Clapton’s “Tears in Heaven.” It was my lucky day.

Who says that getting older actually means growing up? The new comedy “The Best Man Holiday” is about a group of nine friends who reunite years after college for what is anything but a relaxing and peaceful holiday weekend. It features an all-star cast of actors including Taye Diggs, Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long, and Terrence Howard, who are sure to be the film’s main attractions. Over the course of the holiday weekend, sticky situations arise as memories from the characters’ complicated pasts are dredged to the surface. “Best Man Holiday” is a thoughtfully crafted film that addresses many of the complex questions which arise in adult relationships while maintaining a light and humorous tone.
 
The film touches on themes such as interracial dating, miscarriages, fatal illness, adultery, and dishonesty, all palpably real issues that resonate strongly even amid a bevy of juvenile jokes. Additionally, as each issue is brought to light, the problems shift from individual qualms to communal concerns, heightening the drama. Each character fulfills a certain archetype—a workaholic, a self-serious athlete and a failing author, among others. The struggles of all these characters become compounded once they are revealed to the group—at which point they transform into a whirlwind of chaotic holiday madness.
 
The film begins with a flashback, which highlights some of the core conflicts between each character. However, while this montage aims to abbreviate a large amount of critically relevant plot detail, it mainly creates a significant amount of confusion. Since the issues highlighted in this flashback are central to the plot of the movie, it would have been wise for  writer and director Malcolm D. Lee to devote a little more time and care to this sequence. Much of the later drama in the film draws upon the complicated backstories of the film’s characters, and it is unfortunate that these are not better served in the film’s introduction.
 
Although the movie touches on some heavy themes, it balances them nicely with the light-hearted crass humor, which is principally maintained by the film’s comic relief, Quentin Spivey (Howard). This balance is often times very difficult to maintain, but it seems as though Lee has it down to a science. In between dramatic and tear-filled scenes, the movie is filled with locker-room banter about sex, marijuana, and other profanities. After a fun-filled and wholesome evening, Quentin suggests with innuendo to two of the wives, “It’s Christmas—I am willing to give and receive!”
 
The film is rather formulaic in terms of character conflict resolution. Conflicts are take one of two forms: either boisterous screaming matches between feuding women, which involve weave-snatching and name-calling, or full-on brawls between resentful men. When a scandalous YouTube video surfaces that depicts Candace Murch (Regina Hall) in a compromising position, Shelby (Melissa De Sousa)—who is the ex-girlfriend of Murch’s husband Julian (Harold Perrineau)—insults her and fist-fighting ensues. Rather than owning up to her lapse in judgment or dealing with the situation in any meaningful way, Murch grows defensive, and storms out of the house, taking her children with her and leaving her husband behind.
 Overall, the film is filled with clichéd melodrama, but the full arc of the story is both realistic and relatable. One can’t help but sympathize with the characters’ tragic stories, which are sure to leave Kleenex tissues scattered across movie theater floors. The film emphasizes the importance of valuing family and friendship and examines this theme in an approachable and amusing manner.

While he may be commemorated in our history books as the father of physics and calculus, Isaac Newton is remembered by some scholars as a rather heartless scientist. “Isaac’s Eye,” which opens tonight and runs through Saturday in the Adams Pool Theatre, explores the life of a young Isaac Newton and lends warmth to a traditionally cold character.
The plot of this historical fiction is simple—the play begins with Isaac Newton (Todd E. Jones Jr. ’16) in his humble beginnings as he meets the famous Robert Hooke (Deng-Tung Wang ’17). Through this friendship and his own unique experimentation Newton tries to gain admittance into the prestigious Royal Society of London. However, the personal struggles that face Newton are far from simple.
 
“Newton is caught between living his life for the present…and the personal relationships he has versus trying to create a legacy,” director Sekinat J. Yusuf ’16 says. Though her concentration in neurobiology and secondary field in dramatic arts were what initially attracted Yusuf to “Isaac’s Eye,” it was the relevance of Newton’s internal battles that made her passionate about the show, she says. In the play, Newton struggles with a choice between work and his love interest, Catherine (Lelaina E. Vogel ’15).
 
“He isolates himself…. He is an oblivious jerk,” Jones says about Newton. “[The play] is a wakeup call to the overly ambitious.
 
A unique character referred to only as Actor (Sean K. Hardy ’16) guides the plot through Newton, Hooke, and Catherine’s trials, adding colorful commentary throughout the otherwise conventional script.
 
“I create this world,” Hardy says. “So you can basically say I’m God.” In rehearsal, Yusuf worked to develop Hardy’s unusual character, as his narration is central to the play. Although the Actor may not be a traditional role to portray, Hardy says it is the Actor’s narration that sheds light on an underlying theme in “Isaac’s Eye”—the difference between truth and deception.

The play “Conspiracy,” which premieres tonight and will run through Nov. 23 at the Loeb Mainstage, opens in a quaint room; conference tables flank the stage accompanied by plush leather chairs. What the audience doesn’t know is that the paintings that adorn the wall were Hitler’s favorites, and the documents the gentlemen read are meant to be the Nazi plan for the extermination of Jewish people.
 
“Conspiracy offers a portrait of human evil,” director Caleb J. T. Thomson ’14 says. It depicts the proceedings of the 1942 Wannsee Conference in which SS officials and senior officials of Nazi Germany came together to discuss the Final Solution. The seemingly casual air of the show means to add to its didactic and foreboding irony. “The stuff that the men are talking about in this play, they think of themselves as idealists—as progressives pushing forward a new world order,” says Thompson, who is also a Crimson arts editor. 
 
Thompson, who saw the original film version of “Conspiracy” at age 17, says he was profoundly affected by its message and jumped at the opportunity to bring it to Harvard. The students are working with the writer of both the film and the stage adaption, Loring Mandel, to ensure the authenticity of the production.
 
The uniforms of the officials are decorated with realistic regalia, and even the actors’ haircuts are reminiscent of the period’s popular style: shaved on the sides and longer on top.
 
Absorbing a character’s actions and decisions is not easy, especially with this show. “As an actor, having to accept a philosophy that is dark is always going to be daunting,” Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson business editor, says of his role as Reinhard Heydrich. Conner says he spent time researching Heydrich as a historical figure in order to round out his performance on stage.
 
“The challenge for the actors and me is getting inside the heads of 15 of the most evil men that ever lived,” Thompson says.

It’s mid-morning, and you have a few minutes between classes. You’re thirsty, and being health conscious, you make your way to the Science Center and purchase a bottle of water. You chug the water, throw out the bottle, and book it back to your classes. In the process, you’ve dropped $1.25 and used up some finite resources—not as productive as you’d hoped your morning would be.
On Nov. 18, Harvard students will vote to make their mid-morning water breaks more environmentally friendly—as well as more convenient. If the Environmental Action Committee’s referendum passes, the Undergraduate Council will urge administration to end the sale of single-use plastic water bottles on campus while installing water fountains and refill stations in all academic and residential buildings. We at The Crimson suggest that you vote for this measure.
Single-use plastic water bottles represent one of the most easily obviated threats currently plaguing the environment. As the EAC notes on its homepage, the production of bottled water releases millions of tons of harmful chemicals—such as C02—into the environment. After the water’s consumption, those very same bottles often end up in overflowing landfills or swirling, oceanic garbage heaps. Ending the sale of bottled water on campus would constitute a step toward addressing this problem and advancing President Faust’s explicitly stated goal of mitigating the University’s environmental impact.
The referendum’s measures would also improve students’ daily lives. Since the measure also calls for more water fountains placed throughout campus, students would have access to cheaper, cleaner, and more convenient water. Here in Massachusetts, we benefit from some of the strictest water supply regulations in the country, and there is no reason to avoid water fountains or tap water for fear of water quality. Bottled water is not held to the same exacting standards—it simply isn’t cleaner than tap water.
Imagine a world in which you didn’t have to book it to the Science Center and shell out your money just to get some water. Instead, imagine quenching your thirst for free at a conveniently located water fountain, or using a refill station to fill your reusable bottle. The whole endeavor would take less time, cost you less money, and help the environment.
In her letter opposing fossil-fuel divestment, President Faust said that “we need to strengthen . . . our approach to sustainable investment,” and the coming referendum provides us with just that opportunity. This is a common-sense measure that will help the environment and improve our daily lives. We hope you vote “yes” on the bottled water ban, and that Harvard quickly enacts it.

The box score of the men’s basketball 79-37 drubbing of MIT on Tuesday shows Harvard’s dominance in every statistical category, but fails to represent the single stat our Cambridge rivals led in: student attendance.
No matter that its team coughed the ball up for 29 turnovers and managed to go eight minutes without scoring one point. The MIT student faithful arrived early, packed a sizeable section of bleachers, and looked across the court for their Harvard counterparts to begin the type of chanted banter that has come to define student spectating at college basketball contests.
But none came. While Harvard students huddled over textbooks in preparation for Wednesday’s Ec 10 midterm, MIT’s crowd took open shots at our players. “Take home test,” they incanted as Kyle Casey stood on the free throw line.
No response from the Harvard student section. No retributive song of “Scoreboard” to get even. Just a ringing silence in the bleachers that should be home to the wittiest student section in the nation.
Lavietes Pavilion (that’s where our basketball teams play, in case you weren’t aware) seats 2,195 people. It’s what you might call an intimate venue. It’s what others might call smaller than their high school gymnasium. But it’s what an Ivy-League juggernaut of a men’s basketball team calls home, and there’s no reason why our students shouldn’t make it feel that way when they play.
In recent years, student interest and excitement around basketball has grown tremendously, and on select nights in Lavietes, the allotted student seating area will hit capacity. Sometimes, there are hints of genius, the crowd comes alive, and everyone forgets they ever wished that they had gone to a school with a big time athletic program.
But all too often the Harvard crowd forgets that precisely the minds whose wit got them here can also be applied to SportsCenter-worthy vocal support, or worse, they don’t even show up. Why?
Busyness and its resulting stress are probably the two biggest factors. Some would also suggest that students don’t care about sports. But even if you don’t, you likely care about Harvard. Someone might not care about a cappella groups, but still will attend a jam because they recognize the activity’s place inour school’s institutional culture.
Stressed or busy? There’s no better stress reliever than standing alongside several hundred classmates and screaming, or at least that’s what the Bureau of Study Counsel told me.
There are precious few opportunities to come together as a Harvard community and express a collective pride about where we go to school, but every basketball home game is one.
When else can you wear all of the Harvard apparel you bought at the COOP but prefer not to don at home because you don’t want to draw attention to yourself? When else can you chant the name of the school you try to avoid saying when someone asks you where you go? With Harvard’s point guard making as many headlines as its professors, you now have a long-awaited excuse to take ownership of your college.
Own Lavietes Pavillion, and own Harvard. Prove to the people who play with Harvard’s billions that we need a bigger basketball arena. Shatter stereotypes that all we do is study.
Tonight, Harvard’s athletics department wants to set a record for student attendance, allocating 800 tickets to undergraduates. Coach Amaker knows well that 800 students show up to camp out in K-Ville at Duke in the first few hours of its opening alone, hoping to gain entry to the school’s famed student section.
Wouldn’t it be great to give him, for one night, the feeling of being back at Cameron Indoor? More importantly, wouldn’t it be great to give yourself the feeling of being at a “basketball school,” whatever that may mean to you? We have a team of that caliber, and now we need you.

When I read Ruth Starkman’s New York Times op-ed “Confessions of an Application Reader” about her experience as an admissions reader, a scene from the sports movie “Moneyball” came to mind. In the movie, when the newly-hired Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane walked into a free-agency meeting, the Athletics front office staff was evaluating baseball prospects on factors such as “you can hear his [hit] all over the ballpark,” and defended the same loud-hitting player’s poor batting average by the gut feeling that “if you give him four hundred bats, he could be better.” Billy Beane rejected this old norm in baseball scouting, and instead used quantitativemodels to scout and sign undervalued prospects. Billy Beane’s effort allowed the Athletics to build a team that rivaled the Yankees, while spending one third of what the Yankees spent on players.
Baseball scouting has come a long way since Billy Beane’s innovation. Yet, surprisingly, holistic assessment and gut feelings still prevail in college admission. Despite the objective criteria that Starkman was instructed to follow, the admissions process was confusingly subjective. In Starkman’s training sessions, she was told to look for the “bigger picture” of a candidate’s life and that candidates who “help build the class” were more valuable. At times, these criteria seemed purposefully vague to encourage subtle racial discrimination and preference for wealthier students. When she asked why an academically talented Asian student was ranked lowly, her colleague replied: “Oh, you’ll get a lot of them.” The application of such vague criteria was dictated by the discretion of experienced readers. In the “norming sessions,” experienced admissions readers guided the new readers to conform their decisions to a predetermined score. Rather than evaluating a student’s merits with a clearly defined metric, readers were conditioned to rank students based on how they thought other readers, especially more senior ones, would rank them.
Just like baseball scouting based on the decibels of hits, this holistic approach to admissions could use some help from Billy Beane’s quantitative approach to decision making. Colleges already have extensive records of each applicant’s academic profile in high school, as well as an enrollee’s record at and after college. With this incredibly comprehensive data set, a good data scientist can create models that use the student profile to predict future success. What are common high school extracurricular activities for student leaders in college? Which AP classes are most predictive of student GPA in college?  Are active volunteers in high school more likely to donate to their alma mater? These are relevant questions that, if answered by existing data, can help colleges to pick a class of underappreciated leaders and academic stars, with the side benefit of a greater endowment in the future.
The quantitative approach also corrects inherent biases in the admissions process. Thomas Espenshade and Alexandria Radford’s “No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal” discusses how admissions readers are 60 percent more likely to reject students who excelled in ROTC, 4-H clubs, and Future Farmers of America, likely because the typical admissions reader with an east-coast, urban background is unfamiliar with or unsympathetic towards student activities with a rural bent. A more data-driven and impersonal evaluation of student extracurricular accomplishments will not rely on the admissions readers’ cultural assumptions, and will help admissions readers avoid stereotypes that human judgment is prone to making.
Students, especially those from unconventional backgrounds, will benefit tremendously from this data-driven approach. Colleges can identify talented but unconventional students using the equivalents of Billy Beane’s new baseball metrics. For instance, if data shows that low SAT writing scores may not reflect the creative writing ability of immigrant students, admissions offices can find future poets and novelists by placing more weight on the personal essay rather than SAT writing for immigrants. Admissions readers are already looking out for such profiles, but data can only make their judgments more informed.
Of course, one can object that it will be easier to game the data-driven system—students can mimic the “ideal candidate profile” to improve chance of admissions. This type of gaming already exists.The holistic and mysterious admissions criteria have enabled college counselors to extract thousands of dollars with inside knowledge of the admissions office. The opaqueness of the system benefits students with resources and connections, and hurts those without. Making this mysterious process more transparent will only level the playing field. In other words, it is fairer to accept a student who crunches the numbers to find out what activities predicts success in college and pursue those activities, rather than someone whose essay has been manicured by expensive college counselors.
Billy Beane’s success was not just a tale of the revenge of the nerds. It was also the story of a new idea breaking through institutional resistance. Harvard, being the Yankees of higher education, should learn to work smartly with its resources and avoid instinctive resistance to new ideas. College admission, like baseball recruiting, will be a numbers game, and Harvard should be ready to play smart.

Wearing a warm periwinkle sweater, Meg Brooks Swift ’93 discusses the many responsibilities of her job. She manages Harvard’s federal work-study funding and the Student Employment Office, oversees Harvard College Research Program grants, and reads applications for the Admissions Office. The job is intense but flexible—she can leave in the middle of the day to catch a school assembly or PTA meeting if she wants .Her office walls pop with paper plates caked in crayon and lop-sided construction paper masks made by her kids.
Swift wasn’t thinking about job flexibility when, as a senior in college, she sat in OCS listening to a Teach for America presentation (when the organization was small and unheard of, Swift insists). After graduation, Swift moved to New Jersey as a TFA corps member, arriving just weeks before two cities had to cut their TFA programs. Already trained for the classroom, Swift worked as a substitute teacher for a bit but dropped out before Thanksgiving. She didn’t know what she was expecting of her first work experience, but it had been a failure.
Soon afterwards, Swift found herself at the Harvard-Yale game reconnecting with classmates. It was hard not to compare herself to peers raving about the impressive projects they were tackling at work.
Swift worked as a secretary while she looked for jobs that seemed right. One day she got a call from her friend about a position at PricewaterhouseCoopers that involved researching issues of homelessness. The role sounded like a good match for Swift, who had worked at the Homeless Shelter and had written her thesis about homeless families.
Just a few weeks later Swift had the job, which involved doing site visits at organizations that served homeless and low-income populations nationwide. Swift loved the work, and afterwards obtained a position at the Better Homes Fund in Newton, MA, a group that researched and acted on issues impacting homeless families.
“I was being thrown into an experience so different from what my classmates were doing,” Swift remembers. “People were going to work with people from a zillion other Ivy League schools and I was driving off to this office park in Newton, Mass. with people who were talking about their families and juggling kids.”
But the work was stimulating, and Swift says that some of the academic articles she helped author are among her most meaningful professional achievements. “For me doing work I believe in is so important,” says Swift. “There are certainly people who have been incredibly successful who don’t struggle with that and are able to just go and have an amazing experience and have great credentials even when they aren’t as committed to the mission.” Swift realized she was not this way. The impact of her work mattered.
Every Monday night, Swift visited the Bow and Arrow Pub where the Mass. Ave. Dunkin Donuts is now. Her friend from college bartended evenings there after his day at Children’s Hospital, so Swift and her classmates would gather in the dank light of the mostly-empty bar, sharing stories from their jobs.
“That group that I saw regularly throughout the week was a huge support system for me,” Swift remembers. “I realized that having a job and being able to close the door at the end of the day and enjoy your friends was really important.”
Now she had two job criteria: valuing the mission of the work she was doing, and having space for life outside of work. Swift applied to a joint MBA/MPP program at University of Texas in Austin. “Part of grad school for me was not only the education and the additional degree I would get but also the chance to get a different experience,” remembers Swift. Moving away from New England helped her achieve this, and she knew the management training she was getting would be crucial for her future work, whether in public or private sectors.
After graduating Swift joined IBM doing government sector consulting. The position provided geographic flexibility—a must since her fiancé was applying to business schools—and it combined the public and private sectors like her graduate studies had.But Swift soon realized that the work didn’t strike her fancy. She didn’t feel invested. Before long she was surfing job-search websites again.
Harvard was hiring. Swift found a position at Phillips Brooks House and joined to help found the Center for Public Interest Careers under the visionary leader Judith Kidd. “That was the first time when I really appreciated working with people you respect and with whom you share the same values and commitment to what they’re doing,” she says, identifying a new job criterion.
Next, Swift left Harvard to work at a small family foundation. She had always imagined that giving away money to promising organizations would be exciting, but it was not nearly as invigorating as she had hoped. “The bad jobs you have always help remind you of what is important to you,” she says.
Now Swift is back at Harvard, wearing many hats. Sometimes she reads files from home, other days she comes into the office and works amidst her children’s artwork, juggling students, administrators, and staff from across the University in her multi-faceted role. The job is right for now.
Discovering a fulfilling work-lifestyle combination takes time; the criteria for balance unravel and transform as careers develop and priorities shift. But the sooner people can start to articulate an understanding of what professional and personal fulfillment means to them, the quicker they can identify opportunities that embody their values.

Scientists from Harvard have found new information that could explain the evolution of the world’s largest flower, the Rafflesia arnoldii. Long considered an enigma by botanists, the Rafflesia arnoldii is characterized its oversized red, speckled petals and a unique odor of decaying flesh.
According to a study published in late October in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a group of Harvard researchers have gained insight into the evolutionary origin of the Rafflesiaceae family of plants. 
“The Rafflesia is such a strange and unique flower,” said Lachezar Nikolov ’07, a postdoctoral degree candidate in Cologne, Germany. “It was so mysterious that even though it was discovered a long time ago, people didn’t know what’s the organ identity of the different flowering parts of this flower.” 
In order to solve that question, Nikolov collected Rafflesia samples from the rainforests of Southeast Asia and compared the specimens with a relative flower, the Sapria. Nikolov and his colleagues found that although these two types of flowers shared similar qualities, their commonalities were encoded by different genes. 
“These results came as a surprise to us,” said Charles Davis, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor who co-authored the study. “We had thought that something went wrong in the tests, but the more we tested, the more likely it seemed.” 
“These results suggest that the similar characteristics of the Rafflesia and Sapria didn’t come from the same evolution,” said Elena M. Kramer, Davis’s colleague in the OEB department and another co-author of the study.  “It suggests that these species morphed independently from each other.” 
Nikolov said he hopes that the researchers’ discovery will draw more attention to the Rafflesia. 
Botany professor and Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister took a particular interest in the new findings—Pfister served as Kirkland House Master during Davis’s time as a tutor and signed off on Davis’ graduate thesis.
“It’s a cool paper,” Pfister said. “You end up with the same result, but they’re different developmental patterns. As soon as you tell people that there are flowers like this, they begin to connect with it [plant evolutionary biology]."
The results of the study can also serve as a life lesson, Kramer said. 
“I think this is a reminder about the surprising direction that evolution can take,” Kramer said. “Instead of it being the simplest answer, the truth can be more complicated than that.”

A new photography exhibit featuring the blood-red sunsets, misty lakes, and yellow autumn leaves of Maine is set to open to the public on Saturday at the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
Entitled “Thoreau’s Maine Woods,” the exhibit features photos shot by Texas photographer Scot Miller and commemorates the the 150th anniversary of the publication of Henry David Thoreau’s book The Maine Woods. 
“I wanted people to rediscover Thoreau, and this is the best description of the way the Maine woods were originally,” Miller said in an interview with The Crimson on Thursday.
In addition to featuring 34 of Miller’s photographs, the exhibit at Harvard’s natural history museum features a number of natural and historical artifacts, including one of Thoreau’s snowshoes.
Miller is no stranger to translating Thoreau’s writing into images. The Museum of Natural History featured Miller’s exhibit “Thoreau’s Walden” in 2005, and the photographer has also illustrated Thoreau’s “Cape Cod.”
“When Scot approached me again about his personal and photographic journey to the Maine woods, it was just a natural marriage,” said Janis Sacco, director of exhibitions at Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. “He’s willing to entertain very different ways of looking at art and art in nature.”
Miller estimates that he spent a total of 120 days in the Maine wilderness photographing specifically for the book, traversing the state from Bangor to Fort Kent and documenting his journey with the help of a medium format film camera and HD video.
Miller said nature is a central aspect of his work, which he often pursues “in conjunction with conservation causes,” he added.
“It’s just my hope that people will also be inspired to learn a little more about it and get up there and see the place,” Miller said. “As time goes on, it’s getting subdivided, and hopefully some of the land is preserved.” 
By using LED lights to illuminate the photographs and sustainably harvested walnut for the photo frames, Miller hopes to create an environmentally friendly exhibit at Harvard.
“This is my second exhibition here, and I’m very proud of what the staff has done,” Miller said in a talk on the exhibit at the Geological Lecture Hall on Thursday.
Several installation elements complement the photographs, including a recording of forest sounds and a stuffed black bear cub. Also on display is a preserved trillium flower that Thoreau collected during one of his trips to Maine.
“The idea that Thoreau actually collected this and mounted it, and it’s now in the collections, along with many other Thoreau artifacts...to me that says something special about having [the exhibit] here at Harvard and in the museum,” said Jane Pickering, executive director of the Museums of Science and Culture.
The exhibit will run until Sept. 1, 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Workgroup on Student Stress suggested a reevaluation of class scheduling and reading period in its recommendations submitted to College administrators two weeks ago, according to an interview with Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister on Thursday. 
The Workgroup on Student Stress was convened by former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds last November to propose ways to make undergraduate life less stressful. Pfister said that in light of discussions with Director of University Health Services Paul J. Barreira—who co-chairs the workgroup—it is likely that the committee will continue to meet indefinitely. 
“I think we want to see this as an ongoing group that will have a kind of steering committee and some other committees working,” he said.
The 22 administrators, House Masters, faculty members, students, and health experts that make up the committee did the bulk of their work in the midst of a campus-wide discussion about mental health, sparked by a call from many in the College for the administration to reassess the state of student mental health.  
Pfister said that while the administration has yet to tackle all of the Workgroup’s concerns,  some of the problems identified by the Workgroup were addressed independently by the University even before the committee submitted its recommendations.
He cited last spring’s changes to reading and exam period structure—which clarified the types of work that may be assigned during reading period and allowable deadlines for assignments—as an example. The changes also stipulated that professors may not assign new material when students are studying for final exams. 
Pfister also said that the University’s transition to a campus partially based in Allston motivated the committee to consider in its recommendations what scheduling practices could create some “breathing room” in students’ days.
“There are various suggestions about where that breathing room could come from,” he said, noting that administrators are already considering how to potentially restructure students’ academic schedules. 
Pfister said that administrators will attempt to address other issues discussed in the report, including an examination of the effects of extracurricular organizations on student stress. 
“There’s a fair amount of discussion about extracurriculars, and how many we have, and how it is that the growth [of] student organizations and activities contributes to a stressful environment,” he said.
The committee will review its findings with House Masters in coming weeks, after which Pfister said the report may be made available to the public.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A landmark labor case argued before the Supreme Court on Wednesday could drastically impact the ways in which unions organize and expand membership, according to legal and labor experts. Officials representing Harvard unions voiced concerns that future organizing efforts could be seriously hindered by the Court’s decision.
Still, the justices’ questions during oral arguments for the case, Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall, did not provide any clear indication about how the Court would rule on the legality of certain private agreements between employers and unions.
“The initial reports from the Court are that it was a balanced argument, and it’s hard to predict at this point,” said Harvard Law School professor Benjamin I. Sachs. “This is probably the most important labor case in a generation, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.” 
The justices are considering the legality of neutrality agreements, a type of contract between employers and unions. In these agreements, the employer allows the union to function beyond the rights explicitly given by federal law.
Central to this debate is whether or not the allowances exchanged in these agreements can be considered “things of value.” Because the law forbids employers from giving unions money or “things of value,” the agreements will be ruled illegal if the Court accepts the argument that these private contracts between employers and unions are essentially bribes.
According to John T. Trumpbour, research director at the Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program, many in the labor field do not consider these agreements to be illegal but view them as a legitimate means of encouraging collaboration between management and the union.
“[The plaintiff] is trying to make the ‘thing of value’ be a lot more expansive a definition...than the normal definition of outright corruption,” Trumpbour said. “From the standpoint of people in the labor movement, the ‘thing of value’ was if the employer offers a big suitcase of money or a Mercedes to the union.”
If the justices rule that this frequently-used tool is illegal, unions could struggle to organize new members.
“The traditional route to organizing unions doesn’t work, and this is essentially the only way that’s left,” Sachs said. “If the Court were to hold that these agreements are illegal, that they’re felonies, that would have a devastating affect on people’s abilities to organize unions.”
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for the Service Employees International Union Local 615, said that the case signifies “another road block in the ability of people to organize and have unions.” These types of neutrality agreements have “been an important part of the labor relations process” in previous SEIU organizing efforts, Langley said.
The ruling could have a significant effect at Harvard for any union that wants to expand membership, though no practices currently undertaken by any Harvard-affiliated unions would be invalidated.
“This could impact any union, anywhere, including Harvard unions, that want to do new organizing...pursuant to an organizing agreement,” Sachs said. 
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that although the union is not currently engaged in an active campaign to expand membership, HUCTW might be interested in pursuing this type of neutrality agreement with the University should other Harvard employees want to join it in the future.
“Thinking about that kind of situation makes it clear how ridiculous, in a way, the litigation is,” Jaeger said. “The idea that we couldn’t reach an agreement with Harvard to continue acting in the respectful collaborative way...just seems ridiculously restrictive.”
Jaeger said that he, along with many members of HUCTW, would like to see the Court “find neutrality agreements to be perfectly appropriate and legal.”
“It’s a company and a union [being] able to decide to enter into an agreement about how they’re going to treat each other and collaborate and act as partners,” he said.
The justices will likely issue a decision in the spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Funding student groups, overhauling the academic experience, and amplifying student voice—these perennial Undergraduate Council presidential campaign pledges have made their way onto the online platforms of this year’s two UC insider tickets.
These planks are also, sort of, represented on the platform of the joke ticket, which promises on its Facebook page “to be the voice that Harvard students hear. Not the one you hear in Lamont at 4 a.m. The good one.”
The similarities aren’t limited to the recurring promises. On timely campus issues, the two serious tickets—C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, and Chika-Dike Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15—have much in common, and the third ticket—Sam B. Clark ’15 and Gus Mayopoulos ’15—much to joke about. (Both Gong and Nwokike are inactive Crimson editors.)
Take the four referenda that made this year’s UC presidential ballot. Both the Gong-Goffard ticket and the Nwokike-Kim ticket endorse the gender-neutral housing referendum question. While not addressing the referendum question that calls on the University to provide MBTA passes to undergraduates, the Clark-Mayopoulos ticket takes on all the others and then some, promising “to tackle the tough issues, like divesting from gender-neutral weekend shuttles and investing in immigration reform and not having water bottles anymore.”
All three tickets, who will face voters next week, also say they aim to improve the dining hall experience. With Thanksgiving break around the corner, both Gong and Goffard as well as Nwokike and Kim are advocating for expanded dining hall options during holiday breaks. For their part, Clark and Mayopoulos have a more modest proposal: making Tomato Basil Ravioli Soup a staple at every dining hall meal.
As part of their effort to support academics, both Gong and Goffard as well as Nwokike and Kim are advocating for the creation of a degree in Latino and Latin American studies. Last year, current UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 made the same promise to students during their campaign, and a year later, the issue is in the discussion stage.
Both serious tickets also voice the perennial UC promise to increase student group funding. This year, the dearth in UC funding available for club sports has made the issue particularly salient for both insider tickets and other UC representatives calling for an increase in the Council budget. It remains unclear whether any of these candidates will be able to convince the administration to increase the UC budget when it has not increased since 2006 and yearlong efforts to raise the student activities termbill fee have found no success at the College administrative level.
The insider candidates also seem to be in agreement that the UC must better present its initiatives to the student body and engage with undergraduates. Both tickets point to the We The Crimson initiative, which lets student vote on proposals suggested by their fellow students in an online portal, as a tool for such engagement.
Launched last November with high expectations, We The Crimson has fallen out of usage, UC representatives say, because of minimal student participation and lack of coordination between the UC and the transitioning College administrative leadership. Gong and Goffard as well as Nwokike and Kim promise to restore the tool.
The three tickets do not always voice the same ideas, however.
The two insider tickets offer varying suggestions for Opening Days programming. Both agree that freshmen should be exposed to a more diverse set of perspectives during the first few weeks on campus, but they see this reform happening differently.
Gong and Goffard identify gaps in freshman conversations regarding the issues of stress and preferred gender pronouns. Nwokike and Kim, meanwhile, say they wish to see revamped Community Conversations programming more focused on reducing racial and socioeconomic divisions at Harvard.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Nov. 15, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that that the Nwokike-Kim ticket does not mention the gender-neutral housing referendum question or other referenda on its website. To clarify, Nwokike and Kim's official platform, which is not posted on the ticket's website, does endorse universal gender-neutral housing on campus.

Harvard will donate a 0.7-acre parcel of land in Allston to the City of Boston as part of a community benefits package attached to the University’s 10-year Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston. The site, located on 90 Antwerp Street and currently home to an abandoned Brookline Machine warehouse, is worth an estimated $2 million, according to Harvard officials.
The University stated their decision to donate the Brookline Machines site after a request by the Harvard-Allston Task Force to include more funding to promote housing in the neighborhood as part of the community benefits package.
Kevin Casey, the University’s acting vice president for public affairs and communications, said in a task force meeting this week that Harvard hopes the site will be used for the creation of home-ownership housing, but that the City of Boston and the Allston community will determine the ultimate use of the site.
Melina A. Schuler, a spokeswoman for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said that “the neighborhood wants to see multi-family middle-income housing” on the site.
Many task force members expressed their support for building housing on the site of the abandoned warehouse.
However, task force member Tim McHale said that some of the Brookline site’s neighbors have requested that it be converted into a park.
“To create open space is really key,” McHale said.
“If it goes to housing, it can never be anything else.”
Some members of the task force said that building housing on the Brookline Machines site will help to ensure that any fees Harvard pays to the City of Boston are used for the benefit of the Allston community.
As a result of the size of its construction plans, Harvard is required by the City of Boston to pay $11 million in fees for the IMP. This money can be used to support housing and workforce development throughout the city, but members of the task force and the community, as well as representatives from Harvard, have expressed the desire to see those funds funneled back into the Allston community.
Harvard purchased the Brookline Machines site at the request of the community in 2009 during the planning process for the University-constructed New Charlesview apartment complex.
The Brookline Machines site abuts the Charlesview complex, and, according to McHale, the neighborhood “didn’t want a warehouse in the middle of residential housing.”
At that time, Harvard agreed to work with developers to place at least ten units of home-ownership housing on the site to balance over 200 units of rental apartments that constitute New Charlesview.
However, facing difficulty securing financing for the project, and in the face of disagreement among the community over the best use of the land, the City of Boston asked Harvard not to go through with developing the Brookline Machines site.
McHale said he was not surprised by the University’s decision to give away the land.
“It was a no-brainer,” McHale said. “Harvard purchased a lot of land [that] doesn’t serve their institutional needs, so they ended up swapping…community benefits for land.”
McHale said that, at the end of a long debate over the IMP and community benefits, he is excited to begin working with Harvard on actual projects.
“We can take things off paper and put them in the ground,” he said.
“I think there’s an honesty and partnership that’s evolving, and it’s moving in the right direction. We’re turning a corner.”

Philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad have donated $100 million to their namesake institute for biomedical research, the pair announced on Thursday. The gift brings the Broads’ total contribution to the institute to $700 million since its initial launch in 2003, according to a press release.
The Broad Institute, which brings together faculty and scientists from Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Harvard’s affiliated teaching hospitals, has focused its research on addressing challenging medical problems including OCD, Tourette syndrome, and skin cancer.
“We’re more than pleased with the progress they’ve made in the first 10 years, and we thought they needed more unrestricted money,” Broad told the Boston Globe. “We thought this would induce others to contribute.”
The most recent contribution will be allocated to research projects in $20 million increments over the next five years, according to the Boston Globe. Research in the next decade is expected to focus on more effective treatment options for patients, according to a press release from the Institute.
“With their generous gift, the Broads are making possible an entirely new approach for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease,” said University President Drew G. Faust in the press release.
The Broad Institute has built on the work of the Human Genome Project to find solutions for human disease. Its partners include researchers from many of Harvard’s laboratories, including the Sabeti, Rinn, and Balskus labs.
“This award is deeply meaningful,” said Pardis C. Sabeti, associate professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, “both because of the science it will enable and because it signifies the Broads’ reaffirmed commitment to the Institute’s next 10 years.”
Eric S. Lander, the institute’s founding director, could not be reached for comment.
Eli and Edythe Broad, whose fortune comes from investments in real estate, have donated to support the arts, education, and science sectors. In the field of scientific research, they have taken particular interest in investing in human genomics, stem cell research, and inflammatory bowel disease.
“The legacy of collaboration across disciplines coupled with transformative talent, technology, and resources will endure far beyond the next decade,” said Broad in the institute’s press release.
“Edye and I can’t wait to see what they will tackle next.”
This contribution makes the Broads the second most generous donors to a university, hospital, or research institute for biomedical research.
According to Forbes, Eli Broad, 80, has a net worth of $6.9 billion.

Coming off back-to-back wins against Holy Cross and MIT, the Harvard men’s basketball team will put its win streak on the line when it faces Howard University on Friday night.
The Crimson (2-0) will take on the Bison (2-1) at Lavietes Pavilion. Starting off the season in undefeated fashion, Harvard is looking to continue its recent hot play.
So far this campaign, offense has been the name of the game for the Crimson. The team has scored 161 points over the course of its first two games, outscoring its opponent by an average of 26 points per contest. The Crimson has shot 78 percent from the charity stripe and almost 46 percent from the field thus far.
For Harvard, 6’5” junior wing Wesley Saunders leads the way in scoring, averaging 16 points per game. Trailing close behind is co-captain guard Brandyn Curry, who contributed 14 points against Holy Cross on Sunday.
In Tuesday’s win over MIT, freshman Zena Edosomwan played 20 minutes off the bench, scoring 13 points and notching three rebounds.
For Saunders, Edosomwan’s play is a step in the right direction for the team, which is looking upon its younger players to contribute quality minutes.
“Zena is a great player,” Saunders said. “He is young, so he’s learning how to operate on the college level. I think that you saw that he was starting to figure it out as the game [against MIT] went on. He [got] adjusted to the speed of everything and just [got] going.”
The bench has been an important asset in the Crimson’s artillery so far this season, contributing 32 points in the season opener against Holy Cross on Nov. 10 and adding 39 in the MIT game.
Curry did not play against MIT due to a foot injury. If the senior cannot play against Howard on Friday, classmate Kyle Casey will likely take on much of the offensive burden. This will be Casey’s second game back in Lavietes after spending a year away from the team.
“This team has gelled [to Casey and Curry’s return, but] it’s a process,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We hope it continues to gel…. [Casey and Curry have] been very mature and respectful of their teammates. They know in terms of what’s going to happen this year that they are going to be a big part of it.”
Amaker sees Friday’s contest as an opportunity to strengthen aspects of the team’s play that were not fully established in the opening two games. Amaker referenced senior Dee Giger and sophomore Agunwa Okolie as key components going forward.
“We’re hopefully developing [Giger] and [Okolie] along the perimeter lines,” Amaker said. “[Giger’s] a player with great length and size and incredible shooting ability, and [there will be] opportunities for him to come in at some point and play four, five minutes, maybe more, and get two or three shots. It could happen that quickly, and he has the ability to do that.”
Harvard’s defense has also been consistent thus far this year. Overall, the Crimson has forced its competitors to commit 39 turnovers, while averaging 12 steals per game. Opposing teams have also been limited to shooting 24.1 percent from behind the arc and 35.9 percent from the floor.
For the Bison, the game will be an opportunity to win their first road contest of the season. Coming off a loss at Old Dominion on Wednesday, Howard looks to record a victory over its only Ivy League opponent of the year.
The Bison offense is led by freshman James Daniel, who averages 23.3 points per game, racking up a total of 70 points in Howard’s first three games of the season. Daniel was recently named the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Rookie of the Week after his strong performances in Bison victories over Washington College and Gwynedd Mercy University last weekend.
The Crimson, which has not lost a game at Lavietes since a Nov. 27, 2012 contest against Vermont, will look to extend its home winning streak to 13 games when it takes the court on Friday.
“I just think we need to stay focused, keep doing what we do as a team, what we do as a program,” Saunders said. “We’re an older team and a mature team and know how to handle a lot of different situations. As long as we keep our composure and we play hard and to our capabilities, we’ll be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent years, the collision between Harvard and Penn in the penultimate weekend of the season has represented the de facto Ivy League championship game. But that won’t be the case when the Quakers travel to Cambridge on Saturday.
The Harvard football team (7-1, 4-1 Ivy) currently rests in the No. 2 spot in the Ancient Eight, one game behind first-place Princeton. Penn (4-4, 3-2) finds itself even further back, knotted in a three-way tie for third.
But even though the matchup may lack the high stakes characteristic of previous years, the rivalry between the two traditional conference powerhouses will rage on in the Crimson’s last home game of the season.
“Penn always plays us incredibly tough,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It wasn’t a rivalry until about 16 years ago, and it’s been a really good rivalry ever since. They do a great job…. They’re one of the toughest teams in the league to beat.”
The two squads have dominated Ivy League competition throughout the past decade, as the 2006 season was the last in which neither the Quakers nor the Crimson captured at least a conference co-championship. Within that span, Penn is 5-3 in matchups with Harvard.
Last year, the Quakers emerged victorious in a back-and-forth battle by a final score of 30-21. Penn’s grind-it-out running game proved too much for the Harvard defense to handle, and a week later the Quakers were crowned Ivy League champions.
Indeed, for the Crimson, the last two games of the season are always the biggest—first a contest with tremendous implications against the Quakers, and then the annual showdown with Yale. Finishing strong is the key to success for any team, but it’s especially true for Harvard.
“We approach every game saying it is a championship game,” said junior tight end Tyler Hamblin. “Being [against] Penn, and having the history of our two teams the past couple years, we do elevate the intensity a bit. But we still approach the game the same.”
Penn’s season has been full of the good, the bad, and the ugly. One highlight was the team’s dramatic, quadruple-overtime win over Dartmouth in the longest game in Ivy League history.
But its season has also seemed to backtrack at inopportune times. Just as the Quakers had seized their first two-game winning streak of the season, the team was trounced by Brown, 27-0, and surrendered over 500 total yards.
Just a week later with a chance to defeat first-place Princeton, the Quakers found themselves up 16 points in the second quarter. Seemingly in the driver’s seat, Penn would go on to commit six turnovers—including three interceptions from quarterback Billy Ragone—and eventually suffer a 38-26 loss.
“[Penn’s] defense is really good, at times great, but not as consistently great as the past three or four years,” Murphy said. “They just haven’t seemed to consistently from week to week put it together.”
It’s impossible to know which Penn team will show up to Harvard Stadium on Saturday. But the Crimson has issues of its own that need to be addressed.
Racked with a spate of injuries, Harvard has been forced to rely on backups at a number of positions. Defensive linemen Jack Dittmer, Nnamdi Obukwelu, and Obum Obukwelu were all sidelined last week in a win over Columbia.
Several losses on the offensive line, along with injuries to sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer and senior tight end Cam Brate, have also forced junior quarterback Conner Hempel to look to new faces. Hamblin and senior receiver Scott Miller have stepped up in recent weeks, and both posted career-high receiving yards against the Lions.
Since falling to Princeton in triple overtime, Harvard has won each of its past two games. After topping Dartmouth on a late field goal, the Crimson easily blew past Columbia in a 34-0 victory.
But despite the apparent rout, the Harvard attack stalled for much of the game. After quickly seizing a 21-point lead, the offense meandered in the doldrums in the middle quarters and failed to register any points on five straight drives.
“Last week, we were very much hit-or-miss [offensively],” Murphy said. “We’re going to need a more balanced offense, a more consistent offense to work the clock, keep field position, and to do a good job in the red zone.”
To keep its championship hopes alive, Harvard will need Princeton to falter. But in the meantime, little would be sweeter for the Crimson than to avenge last year’s defeat on Senior Day.
“We’ve got two games in the season left, and they’re all extremely important,” said senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn. “Penn’s the first one, so we have to be fully focused and play it like it’s a championship game. That’s the mentality that we’re going to have going into the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a quiet bus ride back from New Haven.
Up 1-0 in the 85th minute, the Harvard men’s soccer team (7-7-2, 5-1-0 Ivy) had given up two goals in five minutes. It was the team’s 13th straight Ivy League loss. To that point, the team’s only win in two months had been a 2-1 win over UMass. On the horizon was a visit to defending league champion Cornell.
“That game was a crushing loss,” co-captain Kevin Harrington said. “We were barely talking and everyone was sitting to themselves. It was a very tough environment for that 2.5 hour bus ride.”
As the team’s bus neared Cambridge, however, coach Pieter Lehrer stood up.
“He told us we had to have faith in the process,” Harrington said. “[He said] things will turn around.”
And, in turn, they did. Harvard won its next game in double overtime on a Harrington goal. It took its next four games by a goal each, never trailing in its next 360 minutes of league play. Heading into its final league game against Penn (7-8-1, 4-4-1), the Crimson has a chance to clinch the Ancient Eight on Senior Night.
Much of the progress has been due to the players the team will honor before playing the Quakers. Co-captain Ross Friedman leads the Ivy League in assists, dominating the center of the field as the focal point of the Crimson’s offense. Harrington leads the team in goals and is the team’s vocal leader on the field.
However, both seniors note the biggest different between this year’s team and last year’s—which failed to win a single league game for the second consecutive year—is Lehrer.
“He understands the struggle that we have had the past few years and what he really wants us to focus on is putting ourselves out there,” Friedman said. “It is difficult after a few tough seasons to put yourself out there. It is easier to be conservative if you aren’t seeing success but…breaking out of your shell and putting yourself out there has been key for us this year.”
Friedman said that Lehrer has focused on getting the team to completely buy into the “process” that he celebrates—focusing on improvement every day and taking the positives away from each performance, win or loss, while getting rid of the negatives.
“No matter if we are up or down, 5-0, we will approach the game the same way and analyze it after,” Friedman said. “We are going to keep the good stuff and keep improving. Every game we add more things—defending set pieces, deflecting balls, etc.”
Against Penn, Harvard will be seeking revenge. The Quakers have beaten Harvard the last two years, including a 3-1 win last year in Philadelphia to end the season. Led by forward Duke Lacroix, who leads the Ancient Eight with seven goals, Penn has posted a plus-five goal margin in league play. Its 27 goals overall lead the Ivy League. Yet, Lehrer said that this week in practice has centered not on Penn, but on getting the team rest and continuing what it has done all year.
“As you get to the end of the season, the players are a bit fatigued—all players are because it is a grind of a season—and sometimes they need to rest, and rest is the best thing,” Lehrer said. “Sometimes it isn’t working hard but getting rest and recovering. We will do the same thing in training and get them a bit sharper and tighter but nothing really changes for us.”
Six weeks after the long bus ride from New Haven, Harvard enters the game with newfound championship aspirations. What appeared unachievable after one game of play is only a tie away for the Crimson.
However, Friedman—whose four Harvard squads have never finished higher than sixth place—and the team are staying in the present. The senior said that against Penn the team will follow the simple formula it has all season: letting go of the past and pushing for the future.
“Your mind is a powerful thing, and sometimes it holds you back,” Friedman said. “You have to let that go and let your mind take you to greatness. Every game, every practice, you want to put yourself out there and that’s the only thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday’s Harvard-Penn game could have been the biggest of the year, another de facto Ivy League Championship Game in a long line of them. But then the Quakers played the fourth quarter last week.
Penn had jumped out to a 16-0 lead over Princeton at Franklin Field and held a lead midway through the third quarter. Then the Tigers pounced.  The Quakers’ 23-17 advantage turned into a 24-23 deficit, and then a 31-23 hole. Princeton’s defense held Penn to 41 fourth-quarter yards while the visitors pulled away from the defending Ivy champions, 38-26.
The loss was Penn’s (4-4, 3-2 Ivy) first to Princeton (7-1, 5-0 Ivy) since 2006.
The Tigers have quickly gone from pretender (1-9 in 2011), to contender (3rd in the Ivy League in 2012), to undisputed king. It shouldn’t be that easy.
Turnarounds are supposed to take time. It’s supposed to be a long, painful process. But evidently Princeton coach Bob Surace found the cheat code, the shortcut from the basement to the penthouse so he did not have to climb the stairs.
Either Harvard or Penn has won at least a share of the last six Ivy League titles.  The Tigers appear poised to change that this season.
And that makes this Harvard-Penn matchup different. Instead of Google vs. Apple, it’s Yahoo! Vs. Bing. Or maybe Saturday’s squads are more like AOL and Myspace, trying to stay relevant after years of success.
Rather than a fight for supremacy, Saturday will bring a struggle for survival. The winners will not be celebrating, they will be hoping.
And regardless of the outcome, Penn will also be worn out. A week after falling in front of 21,000+ fans at homecoming, the Quakers are playing the most important game of their year for a second straight week.
Meanwhile, Harvard is coming off a laugher against Columbia, except it wasn’t funny. The Crimson cruised to a 34-0 win as Harvard coach Tim Murphy rested everyone who had so much as a scraped knee.
Will what amounted to a bye week against the Lions be enough to help the Crimson beat Penn and stay alive in the title hunt? I guess you’ll have to read on…
PENN AT HARVARD (7-1, 4-1 IVY)
It’s hard to believe the defending-champion Quakers are now tied for third in the league. But there’s a good chance they finish even worse than that. Despite returning a number of key players from last year’s team, Penn has lost two Ivy games by a combined 39 points. 2013 could turn into the Quakers’ worst year in quite a while, or they could rally, beat Harvard this week, blow out a winless Cornell next week, and finish a respectable 5-2 in the league. I think the former is much more likely.
PICK: Harvard 31, Penn 20
DARTMOUTH (4-4, 3-2 Ivy) AT BROWN (5-3, 2-3 Ivy)
Could the Big Green be the next Princeton? Dartmouth’s only two losses this year are to Penn and Harvard, the first of which came in quadruple-overtime, while the Crimson squeaked by the Big Green by three at home. Dartmouth relies on its defense, the best in the league, and has given up just as many passing touchdowns as it has accrued interceptions. A win at Brown will give the Big Green some more momentum heading into 2014.
PICK: Dartmouth 23, Brown 17.
COLUMBIA (0-8, 0-5 Ivy) AT CORNELL (1-7, 0-5 Ivy)
Don’t let the records fool you, this game will be exciting: The Battle for New York and the Battle for Last Place, all in one place. Saturday, we will find out what happens when a very stoppable force meets an easily moved object. Columbia scores just seven points a game, but Cornell gives up 38 each week. All of that said, there is bad and then there is horrible. Saturday, Cornell will be happy to be the bad team.
PICK: Cornell 45, Columbia 14.
YALE (5-3, 3-2 Ivy) AT PRINCETON (7-1, 5-0 Ivy)
The biggest game of the weekend pits Harvard’s newest rival against its most famous. Yale’s current spot of third in the conference is misleading given it still has games against the top two teams left on its schedule, but these Bulldogs are better than they have been in years.
They showed that last week, scoring a touchdown with 19 seconds left to beat Brown. The most impressive stat from that game might have been Yale’s near-50 percent 3rd-down conversion percentage, which it compiled while having four different players throw multiple passes.
Princeton uses multiple signal-callers too, but that’s by design rather than desperation. The Tigers also have the best defense on third-down situations and are looking more and more like a well-oiled machine with each win. Even if Harvard sells its soul and roots for the Bulldogs on Saturday, it still will not be enough to trip up the Tigers. They appear to be the team of destiny this year.
PICK: Princeton 38, Yale 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maksim Korolev may have been the first to cross the finish line at the NCAA Northeast Regionals on Friday, but his race is not over yet.
And neither is the race for the Harvard men’s cross country team, which captured one of 13 at-large bids for the NCAA Championships selected by the NCAA Track and Field Committee.  It is the first time since 1979 that the Crimson men have qualified for nationals.
Korolev’s covered the 10k course in a time of 30:11, which put him a full seven seconds ahead of the second-place finisher, Iona’s Matt Gillespie.
The men’s team as a whole was looking to use this race as a chance to qualify for nationals. Syracuse and Columbia took home first and second place, respectively, at the meet to secure the region’s two bids to nationals. By placing sixth, Harvard was unable to guarantee a spot, and was forced to wait until the NCAA announced Saturday’s at-large bids.
Co-captain James Leakos had a 33rd place finish with a time of 30:59, while junior Will Geiken (31:10), and sophomores Tom Purnell (31:14.0) and Chris Allen (31:17.3) took the three through five spots for Harvard.
Although the race’s lead pack got out quickly in the race, the paced settled down and Korolev and Leakos led the front group for most of the race. Around the 6k mark, other runners gave Korolev some pressure, but no one was able to catch up to the eventual winner.
Despite getting off to a strong start, Leakos was unable to maintain his spot at the front of the group, as he has been battling a leg injury in recent weeks. Leakos has consistently been Harvard’s number two runner, and it was unclear prior to racing whether or not he would be at full strength.
“Anytime you’re dealing with injury and working through when things aren’t 100 percent, there’s always a bit of a question,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s got a bright future in the sport, and we don’t want to do anything that would compromise his long-term success. He felt ready to go, and he was excited to go out there and give his best for the team.”
During the championship season, the men’s teams transition from 8k races to 10ks, an adjustment that changes how the team prepares for meets.
“Some guys really benefitted from the longer distance,” Saretsky said. “You’re able to put all those miles and miles of training into use. This is what we’ve been gearing for all year, this championship part of the season.”
However, with the increased distance comes increased fatigue. With only eight days between the regional meet and nationals next week at Indiana State, rest will be key to the Crimson success.
“I’m just being really conservative,” Korolev said. “The eight days is really short between 10ks. Normally we give ourselves at least two weeks between 8ks, and now we have eight days between 10ks. [We’re] just trying to recover at this point. All the work is done.”
The women’s team finished sixth overall in the meet, with junior Viviana Hanley leading the Crimson women in 18th place with a 6k time of 20:46.1.  The team also looked to secure an at-large bid after all regional races were complete, but was unable to capture a spot. Captain Morgan Kelly, junior Molly Renfer, freshman Madeleine Ankhelyi, and senior Emily Reese rounded out the Harvard women’s scoring runners.
Providence and Dartmouth picked up the Northeast region’s guaranteed spots at nationals by finishing in first and second place at the meet, respectively.
“Overall, we definitely were hoping for a little bit more out of regionals,” women’s coach Priscilla Bayley said. “I’m not going to say that we weren’t disappointed. We had a lot of things to be thankful for and a couple glimpses of some good times ahead. Two of our top seven had never really run cross country seriously before, including our No. 3 Molly Renfer, who is normally a middle-distance runner for the team.”
After qualifying for nationals last season for the first time since 1983, the women’s team hopes to continue to improve its depth and consistency. According to Bayley, the current top 10 women’s runners all have run times faster than the squad’s top runner from two years ago.
“We had a lot of different races where the pieces were there,” Bailey said. “We just didn’t put them together on the same day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was little suspense in the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 76-44 victory over the Howard Bison (2-2). Harvard (3-0) led 11-2 after less than four minutes of play, and the Bison, who never led, would never get closer than four the rest of the way. Even with senior Brandyn Curry and junior Kenyatta Smith watching from the bench, the Crimson dispatched the Bison with stingy defense. Howard shot 31 percent from the field on the day and did not make a single shot from behind the arc.
“Defense has always been a calling card for our program from day one,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ve made that an emphasis, a pillar for us to grow and build and establish an identity. I was very pleased to see that all our kids were able to contribute in a lot of different ways.”
The Crimson received contributions from all over the lineup in the victory. Senior Kyle Casey had 14 points in just 13 minutes of play, and junior Wesley Saunders filled up the stat sheet with 12 points, seven rebounds, three assists, and two steals. Eight Crimson players grabbed at least one offensive rebound, and 10 made their way to the free throw line, where Harvard took 38 shots on the night.
“I was very pleased that we were able to play everybody,” Amaker said. “I thought our kids had great energy. It was a great team effort; defensively, the key for us was how hard we played, and for the most part, we had pretty good discipline on the defensive end.”
BREAKING THE PRESS
From the opening tip, Howard played with a full court ‘Havoc’ defense. Known as an underdog tactic, the full-court press was the first Harvard had seen all season. Yet the Crimson faced no problem adjusting. Harvard finished with 12 turnovers on the night, but the bulk were after having its offense set.
A more telling statistic was the fast break discrepancy. Howard had just two solitary fast break points, eight less than Harvard—who often had Saunders leak out down the floor and get behind the press, leading to a pair of early first-half layups.
When asked how his team was able to break the press, Amaker’s answer was simple: “Siyani.”
The sophomore point guard, who assumed the bulk of the ball-handling duties with Curry on the bench, had just three turnovers on the night. Saunders said that having Chambers on the court allowed the team to relax and focus on what it had practiced.
“We knew they were going to pressure us, so we worked on [breaking the press] in practice,” Saunders said. “[The key] is being patient and not getting nervous when they are attacking.”
A STEP UP ON D
On the defensive side of the ball, the Crimson continued an early-season trend of aggressive shot contesting inside. Harvard finished with eight blocks and 19 fouls, many of which came when going after shots near the rim. Even without Curry and Smith, two of the team’s best shot blockers, the team had six players record at least one block.
Some of the Crimson’s best defensive work came on the perimeter, however. Howard freshman guard James Daniel came into the game averaging 23 points on 54 percent shooting from beyond the arc but missed 10 of 14 shots against the Crimson, including all four of his threes. The 6’6” Saunders drew the bulk of the defensive work against the 5’11” Daniel, cutting off his driving lanes with his long wingspan.
“I didn’t know [I’d cover him] until right before the game,” Saunders said, noting Daniel was initially going to draw Curry. “I just knew I had to step up on defense.”
Early in the year, the team has not let an opponent shoot better than 42 percent from the floor. The Crimson’s calling card last year was its offense, but it has not managed to shoot better than its 47.5 percent average from 2012-2013 in any of its games. Yet Harvard stays in contests by forcing 19.3 turnovers a game on the defensive end and limiting opponents to 18 percent shooting from downtown.
Saunders said that the team has focused on defense in the early going, expecting the offense to come along as Harvard gets healthier and chemistry improves.
“I don’t know if [the defense] is ahead [of the offense], but it definitely is our main focus,” Saunders said. “The offense will come. We have a lot of weapons on our team this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overwhelming the visitors with size and athleticism, the Harvard men’s basketball team smothered Howard on its way to a comfortable 76-44 win Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The Crimson held the Bison to 31.2 percent shooting from the field, including 0-for-10 from the three-point line.
“You can be a good defensive team in a lot of ways, but you need to be unselfish, you need to be great communicators, and you also need to give great effort,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we had those three components there tonight working well, regardless of who was on the floor, regardless of who had a Harvard uniform on.”
Harvard did not shoot particularly well itself, going 2-for-17 from beyond the arc, but it was able to get into the paint without much resistance, drawing 27 fouls and going to the free throw line 38 times.
The Bison’s pressing defense did not bother the Crimson, which navigated it with ease throughout the game and managed 28 points off of turnovers to Howard’s eight. Amaker credited sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers with taking care of the ball and dribbling through Howard’s pressure.
“I thought our kids did a very good job of being aggressive and being smart with [the ball],” Amaker said. “Siyani is the key to that, especially not having [senior guard] Brandyn Curry.”
Unlike in its first game against Holy Cross, Harvard got off to a quick start, putting together an 11-2 run to start the game that was punctuated by an and-one from senior forward Kyle Casey. Another 11-2 run to end the half, capped by a buzzer-beating tip-in from junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, put the Crimson up 18 points, 37-19, and effectively sealed the win.
The Crimson coasted for much of the second half, its lead never falling below 20 for the final 10 minutes of the game. In total, 14 players saw action for Harvard.
Perhaps struggling to adapt to this year’s rule changes in college basketball, which include stricter officiating of fouls and post defense in particular, Casey picked up four fouls in his 13 minutes on the floor, though he also led the Crimson in scoring with 14 points. In the season opener, Casey fouled out in 16 minutes.
The benefits and drawbacks of Casey’s aggressive style were on display early in the second half, as he recorded his fourth foul with 15:43 remaining while going up for a block immediately following a tip dunk and an acrobatic and-one on the previous two offensive possessions.
Though Casey’s foul trouble reduced Amaker’s options at forward, Moundou-Missi and junior Jonah Travis stepped up defensively to lock down the Bison. The pair also combined for 18 points and 13 rebounds, playing extended minutes together on the court.
“We talked about those guys giving us what we needed up front would be the difference in our team,” Amaker said. “Obviously, we were saying that with [junior forward] Kenyatta [Smith] in mind, but we still have enough guys up front that have emerged and have taken up those minutes and been able to perform well.”
Howard point guard James Daniel, who entered play on Friday averaging 23.3 points in his first three contests, was held to 14 points on 4-for-14 shooting and failed to connect on any of his four three-point attempts. Junior guard Wesley Saunders took the defensive assignment on Daniel for much of the first half, and the 5’11” Daniel struggled to contend with Saunders’ 6’6” frame and long arms.
The environment inside Lavietes Pavilion was much different than during Tuesday’s home opener against MIT, which was sparsely attended by students. For Friday’s game, the athletic department set aside 800 tickets for students, who filled up half of the seats on the home side of the court and had quite a bit to cheer about as the Crimson jumped out to an early lead it would not relinquish.
After sitting out Tuesday’s contest, co-captain Curry was in uniform tonight but did not enter the game. Amaker said that the team had planned on Curry starting, but an undisclosed injury aggravated during warmups kept him out. Curry was joined on the bench by Smith and sophomore forward Mike Hall, also sidelined by injuries.
“We still have a lot of guys out,” Saunders said. “As everyone gets back and gets used to playing with each other, then we will work things out. We are beginning to get a flow, and the freshmen are getting an idea of where they should be on the court.”

If you’re anything like me, you’re probably wishing for the next two weeks to go by as quickly as possible so you can get to Harvard-Yale and Thanksgiving Break. And if you’re as pathetic as me, you’re probably checking the time of your plane ticket home every time you sign into your e-mail. Here are some lessons I’ve learned recently while counting down the days until break every three hours:
1. You can be a surprisingly amazing home cook with only a microwave and hot water.
The weather is getting so cold that I’m considering hibernating until Thanksgiving break, and one of the things I hate most is the unbearable walk to Annenberg and back (I’m preemptively bracing myself now for angry scorns from those living in the Union dorms). Thanks to a recent trip to Whole Foods, I’ve solved my problem and am now stocked up on boxes upon boxes of oatmeal. I’ll probably get so tired of it that I’ll swear it off for eternity before I leave for break, but having oatmeal three times a day and never having to walk to Annenberg is currently sounding amazing (a note to my concerned parents if they’re reading this right now: don’t worry, I’m not actually doing that).
 
2. That accumulating pile of laundry will never disappear, no matter how much you stare at it with puppy dog eyes.
I have a shameful confession to make—I bought an inordinate amount of underwear before leaving for college so that not doing the laundry would never harm me. Unfortunately, I hit a new personal low last week—I realized that all I had left to wear were ill-fitting clothes from those embarrassing days of freshman year of high school that I for some reason brought with me to college. I stared at my hamper and begged it to be filled with magically clean clothes, but the dirty laundry never disappeared and I ultimately had to make that dreaded trip down to the laundry room. It’s okay though. After putting my clothes in the wash, I promptly rewarded myself with a Nutella-to-Go from the vending machine.
 
3. There is such a thing as excessive cheering for your friends at shows. 
My roommate and entryway-mate were both in the Expressions Dance Company’s show last weekend, and my suite thought it would be hilarious and mildly endearing to make an obnoxiously large sign for them. Using our artistic skills, we accomplished the feat of writing their names in a straight line and pasting embarrassing baby pictures of them onto posterboard. Due to the facts that it’s likely nobody else thought our sign was funny and that we were screaming loudly every time we saw our friends’ faces, we received pretty weird stares from the people around us at the show. If anything, I’ve learned that I will forever be socially awkward and I can’t evade it, so after the show, I hung up our sign on the entryway notice board as a proud indication of my embracing this fact.

Welcome to The Verdict, Flyby's newest advice column!
After living at Harvard for officially 82 days (88 if you count FOP; big shout out to FOP 12!), I can finally say I am happy with my meals here. I have figured out to get exactly what I want out of every breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everyone complains about the dining hall food, many for good reason; but if you search a little harder and spend five more minutes curating your plate, there’s no reason not to be satiated and, dare I say it, satisfied.
Tips and Tricks for Crafting a Quality Salad: 
1. Make your own dressing. I cannot stress this enough. There are so many different oils, vinegars, and sauces to choose from. Do not be afraid of proportions—it’s all about experimentation. Get a little dish to put it in while you are up there, and pour it on your salad once you sit down and are ready to eat!
Options: 
Dressing #1 (my go-to)Sesame OilRed Wine VinegarLemon Juice
Dressing #2Olive OilBalsamic VinegarLemon Juice
2. Chop your salad. This is a biggie. Everyone likes chopped salad better; it’s fact. I swear it only takes you max 60 seconds if you focus and then voilà! You can get a little of everything in each tasty bite. 
3. Order grilled chicken and an egg (ask for “well done”) or egg whites to chop into your salad. You need a little protein in there.  
4. Toppings, toppings, toppings. Fill 'er up! Beans (of the kidney or black variety), edamame, chickpeas, peppers, cucumbers, tomato, beets… the choice is yours (so don’t screw it up). Opt for three or four toppings on a bed of lettuce and you can’t go wrong.
5. Finally: Oregano, flax seeds, ginger powder. Try something new tomorrow. Give one of these a little shake above all your veggies. It may add that extra kick you have been craving. 
Bonus Time: You don’t have to wait in line for hot food!
