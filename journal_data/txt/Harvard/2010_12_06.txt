After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Fédération Internationale de Football Association, the world’s governing body of soccer, announced that the 2022 World Cup will be held in Qatar. Qatar beat out the United States, Australia, Japan, and South Korea for the bid, and it will be the first time a country in the Middle East has hosted the world’s largest soccer event. We believe that FIFA made the right decision to award the World Cup to Qatar.
In a region plagued by much instability and conflict, Qatar represents a model of a thriving Middle Eastern country. The U.S. State Department calls Qatar’s recent economic growth “stunning.”  The country’s nominal GDP is estimated to grow 19 percent in 2010, and its per capita GDP, $67,000 in 2007, is expected soon to be the highest in the world. Qatar is also politically stable. The country is ruled by the Al-Thani family, who has never faced a serious external political threat; admittedly, this is largely because there is no significant opposition party. Qatar has used its economic and political strengths for the good of global sport in the past; the country cited its successful hosting of the $2.8 billion-dollar 2006 Asian Games in Doha as evidence for its track record of success in holding international sporting events in an orderly and enriching manner. Hosting the games will be a great way for Qatar to show worldwide audiences how much it has developed as a country and will generate optimism for the future of the region.
Although it is unfortunate that the United   States lost the bid, we do not foresee this being much of a blow to soccer fans here. America hosted the World Cup in 1994, and in the words of FIFA itself it was “hugely successful.” The attending crowds numbered 3.6 million, which is still a record number, and in the final, Brazil won its first World Cup since 1970. In light of this history, it is encouraging to see that FIFA is interested in fostering a sense of internationalism with the Cup, by bringing the event to new places around the world. Soccer is the most global of sports. It is played with enthusiasm on every continent, and its biggest stars represent a cornucopia of nations. Thus, games like these are an excellent way for the world to come together and collectively share in competition and camaraderie. We hope that there will be no resentment on the part of the countries that lost the bid, for such an attitude would undermine the international spirit that defines the World Cup.
Qatar is currently undergoing a cultural revival of sorts: It recently built a $3 billion Museum of Islamic art, French architect Jean Nouvel is working on an annex to the National Museum of Qatar, and in 2009 The New York Times named Doha, Qatar's capital, the “cultural destination of the year.” The World Cup will give this country the opportunity to showcase the strides it has taken in recent years to highlight its rich history and legacy, and we are excited to see its culture shared with the world when the World Cup commences. Qatar will undoubtedly prove its capacity to undertake such a massive enterprise, and we eagerly await what the country has in store for the world come 2022.

In a recent move by the incoming Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the YouCut Citizen Review put the National Science Foundation’s funding on display for consideration, by the American public. Designed as a grand experiment to better incorporate the electorate in funding decisions, YouCut was intended to allow the average citizen to assist in the reduction of government waste. This is an admirable mission, especially considering the release of new information on the country’s $13.7 trillion-and-rising debt burden.
However, it should not be the prerogative of the average American to review what deserves funding in the sciences, and what does not. History has shown that too often, funding for the sciences has been influenced by political and other non-scientific considerations, with resources and money ebbing and flowing with each new administration and the sentiments of the American people. For example, throughout the contemporary vaccine debate (intensified by an October Supreme Court case), popular celebrities and online media influenced a large number of Americans to believe that one of public health’s greatest achievements is somehow too unsafe—despite the overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.
The primary issue lies not with the actual science itself, but the means by which science is communicated to the public. Every day, countless articles are published in academic journals and books on a multitude of topics, yet it is impossible for the average citizen to be expected to have the baseline knowledge to form a reasonable conclusion on whether a particular finding has merit. In essence, for one to determine whether a paper in a journal with a focus on neurobiology is reasonably articulated and carries potential for future innovation, that individual must have both the relevant background and experience in the field of neurobiology as well as be able to comprehend such materials from a scientific mindset. What that means is that a person must be able to intimately understand the jargon and pathways in which scientific inquiry moves forward, a foundation that goes beyond what may have been taught in grade school or even higher education.
Such critical experience is vital, yet Republicans have capitalized on the discontent of the populace and chosen to ignore this ideal in their campaign. On the YouCut website, two studies are cited (one on soccer players, the other on sounds in video games) to try and inflame the reader to investigate further “wasteful” spending at the NSF. However, it disregards the simple fact that science does not operate in a vacuum.
In the words of Isaac Newton, “If I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Every project builds off the common knowledge of the past and has the ability to advance the realm of human understanding one more step forward. Consumer products, ranging from the Global Positioning Systems to the memory foam in our beds, came about from what could be arguably wasteful research funding. They came to fruition based on the painstakingly established groundwork of the basic sciences and the subsequent steps from there to the applied realm.
The public is not necessarily trained in that sort of framework, and because of that, we cannot expect to treat cuts in science as we would more straightforward and practical issues, such as lawmaker salaries and perks. When we impose that sort of responsibility on average citizens, superficial issues such as nomenclature or the inability to comprehend the future benefits of a technology tend to trump the often more technical, less accessible jargon that peer researchers understand and base their opinions upon. The amount of $750,000 “to develop computer models to analyze the on-field contributions of soccer players” might sound unnecessary at first glance, but the study was designed to more broadly analyze the role of “team members in any organization,” offering insights into efficiency and productivity that have a sweeping impact in areas such as manufacturing and business, providing a much-needed competitive edge.
Republicans may score points for making the reasonable claim that spending should be reigned in, but they must consider the reality that science funding has been the backbone of America’s technical development and prowess. Any attempts to cut or draw down this funding are short sighted, and more importantly, undermine the engine that has catapulted the U.S. into its dominant position today.

The year 1984 was never supposed to be a cheerful one. It was a time of dystopia as memorialized by the novelist George Orwell in his novel of that name. It proved no better for many residents of Bhopal in central India who have, since that fateful year, experienced a continued dystopia and nightmare. For those affected by the lethal leak of methyl isocynate (MIC) gas from the chemical plant owned by Union Carbide Corporation on the night of Dec. 2 1984, every year has been 1984 all over again, with seemingly endless experiences of denial of justice. For several years government health establishment refused to recognize the presence of long-term effects of the gas. The compensation handed out to the affected ($500 per person affected and $2000 per lost life) was largely a botched process and a disgraceful compromise compared to earlier precedents of financial compensation in the case of industrial disasters. The guilty were never prosecuted. A recent verdict convicted some of the guilty to a mere two- years in prison, and completely let others off the hook.
It has been 26 years since the leak happened, but the Bhopal disaster is a continuing one. The city of Bhopal continues to be contaminated by poisonous chemicals from the abandoned factory that leach through the earth and groundwater and circulate in the ecosystem. In fact, the drinking water supply for 18 communities in the area remains contaminated.
As one stands 26 years away, looking back, what sense does one make of "Bhopal?" The pungent and acrid odor of MIC gas that incapacitated people's lungs and immune system on the day of the tragedy has probably faded away. Inadequate compensations have been doled out, books have been written, documentaries have been made and innumerable protests by activists on the ground have generated a fair amount of international outrage. The ownership of Union Carbide has changed hands and the reins are in the hands of the Dow Chemical Corporation now but the guilty parties elude arrest.
How long do bad memories remain in people's minds? What was the issue again, people ask? Has it not been settled? If Union Carbide no longer owns the plant, why hold the new owners Dow responsible? Haven't the survivors moved on? Aren't there greater tragedies that have overtaken our world since? Such questions reflect the fatigue that sets in as days and years go by. They try to banish the criminal event away from our consciousness, once and for all, hoping it will all sort itself somehow.
But a part of the Bhopal story is the incredible struggle that survivor groups and their supporters have been waging despite the disadvantage that passing time and fading memories bring. This is a struggle against forgetting. This is a struggle against impunity -- impunity on the part of those ultimately responsible for the disaster. This is a struggle against big, self-righteous corporations and bumbling governments. Mostly it is just a struggle to keep the struggle alive and going.
Between three to eight thousand people perished in the wake of the gas leak, depending on the reporting agency. But death and disease have never left Bhopal. The website of the non-profit clinic, Sambhavna ("The Possibility") which provides free treatment to the survivors, states that, "An estimated 120,000–150,000 survivors of the disaster are still chronically ill. Over 25,000 have died of exposure-related illnesses and more are dying still."
The disaster that struck Bhopal is still with many of them, transmitted from generation to generation. Most of those affected by the gas on the day of the leak were poor people. Their lives were considered cheap and dispensable. They were voiceless to begin with. Had the gas affected some of the richer parts of the city of Bhopal, we would probably had seen a different story unfolding. The survivors have braved every form of apathy year after year. They, along with their supporters, tirelessly working to seek redress, have not lost sight of the basic issues of denial of justice.
Student groups from four universities–Boston  University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, and Tufts–held protests on their respective campuses this December 3, the day of the 26th anniversary of the disaster. They distributed informational handouts, performed symbolic die-ins, and collected signatures for a petition. “The Bhopal disaster is so deeply tragic because it demonstrates how governments and corporations differentially value human life,” said Lauren A. Onofrey ’12, a student at Harvard and an activist with the Harvard AIDS Coalition. At the conclusion of the day's events, a Boston-wide protest and candle-light vigil was held near the Harvard T stop from 5 p.m. onwards. As one of the participants in the protest there observed, “This is not just about Bhopal; this is about injustice everywhere.”

Thirsty? Here in the U.S., we all are lucky to have access to clean drinking water, but many people in the developing world are not so lucky. More than one in six people lack access to adequate drinking water in developing countries. This amounts to nearly 1.1 billion people without access to safe affordable drinking water, a basic necessity to live a healthy and productive life. What if the clean water we purchase here could help bring clean water to those who lack it around the world?
As students at one of the most prestigious universities in the world, we should feel an obligation to share our privilege and work towards solving global inequities like this one, even through minor contributions and slight changes to our lifestyles.
A current Harvard student and an HBS graduate have made it their mission to bring clean water to people all over the world by providing us the opportunity to purchase water that will further water projects in developing countries when they founded Nika Water Co. three years ago. Theirs is an example we can all follow.
Nika, which is Zulu for "to give," was originally founded in San Diego by former HBS graduate Jeff Church and a team of young social entrepreneurs, one of which—Kara M.  Kubarych ’13—is now a sophomore at Harvard. The social business sells purified carbon neutral bottled water (which means that they invest in carbon offsetting programs, such as their reforestation project in Nicaragua) and donates 100 percent of the profits to clean water, sanitation, and other poverty alleviation projects in Nicaragua, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya through partnerships with established non-profits.
While water purification for big populations may seem unachievable and costly, in fact, twenty five dollars can bring clean water to a person for a lifetime. Relatively speaking, $25 is a little pirce to pay with big returns. Because most of us spend $25 every week on eating out or at Starbucks or CVS, it hardly seems fair that petty spending in developed countries equates to essentially the cost of a life in an under-developed country.
Church realized the injustice of this disparity and got the idea for Nika Water after he traveled to Kenya with his family in 2007 and saw the devastating effects of the clean water crisis. Although people are often skeptical about the work of NGOs and how they use their money, to insure quality and transparency in its giving, Nika selects and monitors its beneficiaries carefully. Church visits each site and meets with the aid workers on the ground before investing in a project. The team also visits the projects to witness its impact and sustainability. Last March, the founding members of Nika traveled to Nicaragua where they turned on a system that brought clean water to 750 villagers for the first time. The team plans to work on the final phase of a two-year community development project this summer in Kenya with Free the Children.
Since its launch in spring 2009, Nika Water has expanded dramatically and is now carried in over 500 stores in Southern California. This fall the product expanded to Boston and is sold in many stores in Harvard Square as well as Harvard vending machines. The success of Nika at Harvard can be attributed to the hard work of Kara Kubarych and a small team of Harvard students dedicated to the idea of using business for good.
Kubarych, who was very involved in the launch of Nika as a senior in high school, is now eager to spread the trend of this philanthropic company from the west coast to the east.
Currently, she’s  coordinating a Nika Business Development Team that is planning to work with other Boston colleges and vendors to promote the product and cause. While there are many great service and development groups at Harvard, working with Nika offers students a different, more entrepreneurial, experience. “Social enterprise can make a real sustainable impact on global issues,” Kubarych says. “It is exciting to see Nika grow and evolve with the help of likeminded students and conscious consumers.”
The social and environmentally conscious design and mission of Nika seems to be catching on quickly in Harvard Square and will hopefully expand more in the Boston area. Water is essential for life, and we take it for granted every day. There are many projects students can get involved in that work toward bringing clean water to populations that need it most, such as Children of the Border, where Harvard students travel to the Dominican Republic during the summer to install wells in communities. Even if you don’t want to dedicate a substantial amount of time or money to bring others clean water, with a smart design like Nika, helping someone halfway across the world survive is as easy as a trip to the Science  Center vending machine.
Bottoms up!

The modern day implications of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education court case—the topic of Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow’s recent book—were discussed in a conference Saturday afternoon.
The event, which featured professors from Harvard, Yale, and NYU, marks the second collaboration between the Law School and the Humanities Center at Harvard.
The conference’s two panel discussions addressed what Humanities Center Director Homi K. Bhabha called “the thorny issues of integration, choice, and inequality” in the American educational system.
Minow said she was “thrilled” about the event. “This is the kind of thing you dream about happening—people reading what you wrote and discussing it,” she said.
Randall L. Kennedy, Harvard law professor and former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, noted  that while numerous books have been written on the important court case, Minow’s book adds to the discussion by “dramatically enlarging the frame in which we see Brown.”
Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who said she attended segregated schools in Atlanta until the age of 14, said that she felt a personal connection to the book.
“I and my classmates wondered why we did not have new books or swimming pools...in the schools, racial tensions were on display on the playing field and in classroom encounters that are too numerous to list,” Hammonds said. “I’m glad that Martha wrote this book. In a deeply personal way, it reminded me of how much my parents’ generation was deeply invested in Brown.”
Bhabha said the conference made him realize that he had also been “bused” to school as a child.
Bhabha described how he travelled from his home in Bombay, India to a nearby Roman Catholic Jesuit school.
“Full disclosure—I was ‘bused’ in a private car with a chauffeur,” Bhabha added to the audience’s amusement, but he clarified by saying that many of the socioeconomic tensions that existed in segregated America were also on display in India.
Bhabha said he felt the conference was an enriching experience for all the attendees.
“I certainly came away from it with a much richer understanding of the issues of equality, integration, and choice in their legal, political, social, and ethical dimensions,” he wrote in an e-mail.
Audience members echoed his sentiments.
“While the panel asked more questions than it answered, it was interesting to hear lawyers’ perspectives on these issues,” said Jennifer M. Huntington, who worked in the public education system as both a teacher and a principal for 27 years.
While Huntington said she was disappointed that there were no public school educators on the panel, she added, “I’m definitely going to go buy a copy of Minow’s book now!”
While there are no specific joint events currently planned between the Law School and the Humanities Center in the near future, Bhabha said in an e-mail that the partnership is “a thriving collaboration that will certainly continue.  Dean Minow and I are both committed to giving the ‘legal humanities’ a robust presence on campus.”

Wealthy women in developing countries are more likely to be overweight than their socioeconomically disadvantaged counterparts, according to a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health.
The study, which considered data from 54 countries labeled as low to middle income by the World Bank, found a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and high body mass index in all but Moldova and Kazakhstan.
The nutritional trends in developing countries have not followed the same path as those in developed countries, where primarily the poor are overweight, said S. V. Subramanian, the lead author of the paper and an assistant professor at HSPH.
Subramanian said the trend in developed nations can be attributed to inexpensive food that helps low-income people maintain an appropriate daily calorie intake. He said that food prices in developing countries are often still expensive, especially relative to spending power.
While the strength of the association varied among the developing countries, an average increase by one quartile in the wealth index was associated with a 33 percent increase in the number of overweight people.
Subramanian said that he was motivated to conduct this study because of the lack of data-driven research on this subject in developing nations.
“We have a lot of studies from developed countries, but we don’t really know what is happening in developing countries,” said Emre S. Özaltin, an HSPH student and a co-author of the study. “This really is the most comprehensive look that gives us a picture of where we are, and getting the epidemiological picture correct was quite important.”
The researchers took data from 1994 through 2008 on height and weight of women of reproductive age—between the ages of 15 and 49—and calculated BMI.  Although the study focuses on overweight trends in higher socioeconomic tiers in developing nations, Subramnian said it reveals a need for a comprehensive nutritional policy across socioeconomic lines.
Most of the developing countries analyzed in the study are also facing underweight health-related concerns, largely among the poor, but Subramanian said these problems are more likely to go unaddressed in the press and in politics because they affect a less influential segment of society.
According to Subramanian, a focus on obesity among the wealthy should be complemented by a policy aimed at targeting under-nutrition among the poor.
“It’s a much better scenario than that we encounter in western countries, where hunger and obesity are concentrated in the same group,” he said.
The results of the study were published online last month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

Students from the Gardner Pilot Academy gathered at Harvard’s Gordon Track for a carnival organized by Harvard students this past Friday.
Over 100 Harvard undergraduate volunteers guided 350 students from the first through fifth grades through a number of activities, including painting plant pots and making animals out of pipe cleaners.
The event was part of a program started by the GPA this year that rewards good behavior by students with paper hands, representing a high-five. Field trips are the culminating reward for students.
The event was coordinated by the Institute of Politics, the Harvard Democrats, and the International Relations Council.
A number of other student organizations helped out, including the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, the Pleiades, and CityStep.
The Senior Class Committee, which also played a pivotal role in the creation of the carnival, staffed 12 of the 20 booths, one for each of the houses.
Elizabeth J. Newton ’11, chair of the IOP’s community action committee, was the lead organizer of the carnival. Newton, who said she had been thinking about a day of service for Harvard students, contacted a vice president’s office, which put her in contact with the GPA.
According to Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, president of the Harvard Democrats, the carnival was part of a larger initiative organized by himself, Newton, and Jennifer M. McKee ‘11, president of the IRC.
“The interest behind it was really our recognition of the fact that on Harvard’s campus there really isn’t an in-between between the two extremes of complete devotion to community service at [Phillips Brooks House Association] and the other students who are doing absolutely no community service ever,” Berkenfeld said.
The carnival with the GPA students was the first event in what Berkenfeld hopes will become a larger campaign of community outreach by Harvard undergraduates. He said that the goal of the organizers was to eventually host a service project as frequently as every month.
Berkenfeld speculated that the administration’s support for the carnival stemmed from “a deeper desire to continually build better relationships with the Allston community,” where Harvard owns property, and where the GPA is located.
Harvard has collaborated with the GPA on a number of programs, including the Harvard Education Portal, through which several GPA students have been mentored by Harvard undergraduates, and the Harvard Achievement Support Initiative, which offers grants and professional development to Boston schools and students.

The Undergraduate Council inaugurated its new leaders—President Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Vice President Bonnie Cao ’12—during its final meeting of the semester yesterday afternoon.
As outgoing President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 popped a bottle of champagne, he and outgoing Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 swore in their successors.
“If I could leave the UC to any person,” said Bowman, “not just on the UC but in the world, I would leave it to Senan.”
Ebrahim and Cao were elected to office on November 18, defeating two competing tickets.
As their first pieces of legislation as a ticket, Ebrahim and Cao put forward two acts commemorating the work of their predecessors. Under the Hysen History Act, in honor of the outgoing Vice President, the Council will form a committee to investigate and document the UC’s 28-year history over winter break.
In addition, the Council honored this past year’s president with the “John ‘Johnny’ F. Bowman Chill Out Act,” which resolved to keep the UC “chill, always.”
“I remember when I was a freshman on the UC it wasn’t a lot of fun,” Ebrahim said. “Things just got really awesome [under Bowman].”
During the meeting, the Council also voted Elm Representative Michael A. George ’14 as UC Secretary and Dunster Representative Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 as the Council’s Treasurer. Rounding out the UC’s executive board, the Council announced the new chairs of the five executive committees.
The Council also wrapped up ongoing projects with several pieces of legislation.
In an effort to make students aware of the inaugural Optional Winter Activities Week—the final week of winter break in which all students can return to campus to participate in activities and events—the UC implemented a plan to publicize OWAW with a combination of tabling and e-mails to the student community.
“If this OWAW flops, we’ll go back to having nothing during winter break,” Ebrahim said.
In response to the recent string of robberies on and around campus, the Council passed legislation to publicize the Harvard University Campus Escort Program, which provides a safe walk home for students. This was the first of several intended initiatives to address the issue of safety on campus over the course of the coming semester, said Ivy Yard Representative Akshay Sharma ’14.
The Council also set aside $3000 to hire a web developer to improve online services for students next semester, including a revamped Shuttleboy application.
In addition, the UC’s Education Committee published a position paper on first year advising, with recommendations including an advising training program and an award for an outstanding freshman advisor.

High school students came from around the greater Boston area and beyond yesterday to attend the Athena Conference, where Harvard undergraduate volunteers led them in self-defense classes, creative performances, and guided discussions.
The Athena Program, which was founded over 15 years ago, aims to educate high school students, especially young women, about gender, sexuality, and female empowerment in a fun and safe environment.
The program held their semi-annual conference at the Student Organization Center at Hilles from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The organization, which as a policy does not turn anyone away, hosted 15 women and three men. The attendees were predominantly disadvantaged students from public and charter schools.
The Athena Program, which displayed the slogan “Blasting Through Stereotypes” on the poster at the entrance to the conference, hoped to help young women recognize the subliminal messages coming from the media and then rise above the resulting pressure, organizers said.
“We want to create a conference dedicated to creating a community of girls dedicated to communication about gender and social justice and fun,” said Athena Conference co-organizer Alice M. Laramore ’11.
The Athena Program volunteers used several different types of activities to make the girls comfortable in their environment. They encouraged them to write down the ground rules they wanted for the conference on the floor, and then to step over the rules into the “safe space” which the conference provides.
Participants gave enthusiastic and positive feedback about the conference.
“I didn’t know what to expect...I learned a lot,” said Jasmine Boyd-Perry, a senior at Boston Latin School who was participating in her first Athena Conference.
Boyd-Perry ran a workshop for other high school girls, which she said was a rewarding experience.
“Putting on a workshop...it sort of automatically gives you empowerment,” she said. “Every high school girl should at least know something about [issues of gender and sexuality].”
Boyd-Perry also praised the mentor-mentee relationships at the conference, explaining how the program participants meet up with the mentors to simply go eat or “hang out” together.
Ronesha Williams, a senior at Boston Latin Academy, echoed Boyd-Perry’s positive thoughts about the conference.
“It’s really good for leadership skills,” Williams said of teaching her first group of students.
Mentors in the program said they were excited about the effects they see the conference having on the girls’ lives.
“Once the conversation has started, it goes past this conference,” said DanThuy T. Chu ’13, a mentor and former participant in the conference.
Event co-organizer Tara D. Venkatraman ’11 said she enjoys observing the empowerment the young women feel.
“To see them owning this conference as their own...that’s really powerful,” she said.
Diedre Degraffenreid, a counselor at the YMCA in Dorchester, brought two girls to the conference and was very pleased with the results.
“I thought it was really good,” she said, “I’ll bring them back. Definitely.”

Under clear skies and generous sunshine, hundreds of undergraduates—many holding “absurd” signs—gathered outside the Harvard Hillel to respond to protestors from the Westboro Baptist Church.
Various undergraduate student groups collaborated to host the “Surprise Absurdity Protest,” intended to dismiss the anti-Semitic messages of the Kansas-based religious organization, which is known for hosting anti-homosexual protests across the country.
On Friday, six Westboro protesters stood in the traffic island at the corner of Mount Auburn and Linden Streets, holding signs that read “God Hates Fags” and “Your Rabbi Is A Whore.” Half of the Westboro demonstrators were children, one of whom held a sign that read “Santa’s Little Helpers” accompanied by a caricature of two individuals engaging in anal sex.
Across the street, 200 to 300 counter-protesters, including undergraduates from several local universities, Harvard Chaplains, and a Cambridge Quaker organization, stood behind barriers in front of Hillel.
Lilli R. Margolin ’11, Hillel’s vice president for community relations, and Chelsea S. Link ’12, a leader at the Harvard College Interfaith Council, both contacted various student organizations and Houses to attract counter-protesters to the event.
Both Link and Margolin said they thought the event was a success.
“The protest on Friday was fantastic. It was more than anyone could hope for.” Margolin said. “Our gathering really outshone them.”
Margolin praised the outpouring of support Hillel received from other student groups, saying it provided a “heartwarming feeling” to counter the mood of the Westboro Baptist Church’s protesters.
Emma Q. Wang ’12, co-chair of Harvard Queer Students and Allies, expressed similar sentiments but added that there were not as many members of QSA at Friday’s event compared with Westboro’s protest at Harvard Law School and Cambridge Ridge and Latin School last March.
Organizers of the counter-protest said they were taken aback by the fact that the Westboro Baptist Church protesters neither engaged with participants of the Surprise Absurdity Protest nor overstayed their scheduled time from 10 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. In Cambridge, protesters are not required to secure a permit, prompting many Hillel members to believe that Westboro members might remain on Mount Auburn Street past 11:00 a.m.—and leading some would-be-counter-protestors to arrive after Westboro members had left.
Security was tight for the protest, with several dozen police officers from the Harvard University and Cambridge Police Departments on hand.
The city set up barriers to control the crowd.
Despite Westboro’s message, the mood among the counter-protestors remained lighthearted and celebratory.
Alice X. Wang ’14 and her friends said they stayed up late to make signs that read “I <3 Juice” and “My poster brings all the boys to the yard.”
Lexis B. Ross ’13, for whom Friday’s event was her first protest, commented on how many students in the crowd had never been politically active before this protest.
She added that she thought the event was a great way to get individuals to come together in the name of tolerance and interfaith values.
Margolin echoed that sentiment.
“There’s still hope for our generation to be able to lead in a positive way and come together,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Civil Rights Division of the state Attorney General’s office is joining the Boston Licensing Division to investigate Cure Lounge’s decision to shut down a party for African-American Harvard and Yale graduate students and alumni, according to an e-mail sent to students at Harvard Medical School on Thursday.
The e-mail, sent from Medical School faculty, said that Maura T. Healey, chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Attorney General’s office, encouraged other attendees to come forward with their accounts.
The faculty noted that Healey said she would be sensitive to students’ concerns about confidentiality.
The Attorney General’s announcement was prompted by complaints from several attendees of the party, according to the Boston Globe.
Boston City Councillor Ayanna Pressley announced in November that she asked the city’s Licensing Division to investigate the incident.
A spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said that the city’s Licensing Division would be “working closely with the attorney general’s office” to determine whether the club’s behavior was inappropriate, according to the Boston Globe.
Students complained that Cure racially discriminated against the attendees of the Nov. 20 party after the management shut down the event prematurely, saying they had seen well-known “gang bangers” in the swarm outside the club and were afraid that the group would attract “the wrong crowd.”
George Regan, Cure’s spokesperson, told the Boston Globe that the club made the right decision when they ended the party, saying that the club’s management was concerned that the people they recognized as known trouble-makers were a security threat to others in attendance.
Regan said this potential danger was only one reason for the management’s decision to shut the party down.
In addition, he cited a dispute between the club’s management and the party’s promoters about whether University ID was required for entry.
Regan said these two factors justified the club’s decision to end the party.
“If this happened tomorrow, they’d handle it the same way again,” Regan said. “There’s nothing to apologize for.”
Event organizers Michael M. Beal ’06 and Kwame Owusu-Kesse ’06, both second-year students at Harvard Business School, could not be reached for comment.
Medical School Associate Dean for Student Affairs Alvin F. Poussaint, who co-authored the e-mail sent to  Medical School students, told The Boston Globe that the club should have called police or reinforced security if they were worried about troublemakers and that the club owners should apologize to the attendees.
“They can’t shut down a club to blacks or any other group on the basis of race,” Poussaint said in the Boston Globe.
“Would they shut down the club if it was tough-looking white kids in line?” Poussaint added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-six newly elected Congresspeople gathered at the Institute of Politics last week to attend sessions on topics they will address as legislators, as well as to meet other new members and interact with undergraduates.
During the 19th Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress, the freshman Congresspeople attended panels on important policy issues, such as foreign policy, the economy, and education. In addition, they attended panels on more practical issues, such as how to deal with the White House and the media.
Although 18 of the 26 members who attended are Republican, the conference prides itself on hosting a mix of Republican and Democrat panelists. “The real importance of this is to get Republicans and Democrats to talk with each other and find out how they think and how to find common ground,” said Christian B. Flynn, the IOP associate director for conferences and special projects.
“The purpose [of the panels] is to inform [the Congresspeople] as much as we possibly can and to provide as much expertise as possible,” said Benjamin S. Raderstorf ’14, a member of the IOP Special Events Committee who helped plan the conference.
On Friday, former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, New York University Professor of Education Pedro Noguera, and former Chancellor of District of Columbia Public Schools Michelle Rhee participated in a panel about education policy.
Dean of the Graduate School of Education Kathleen McCartney, who moderated the session, asked the panelists to discuss their recommendations for the elementary and secondary education acts, which includes the possible renewal of No Child Left Behind.
That is the main education topic the new members will be addressing in Congress.
Spellings, who was Secretary of Education when NCLB began, explained what NCLB is.
Rhee discussed the importance of teacher achievement and laying off ineffective teachers.
“Don’t think of overhauling the entire thing,” Rhee suggested, “But, rather, improving what is not working.”
Noguera discussed the lack of instruction in NCLB about how to improve schools and the importance of finding scalable school models that can be spread around the country.
The diversity of the panel allowed the members to get a comprehensive, bipartisan view of education.
Lou J. Barletta, a new Congressman from Pennsylvania, said that the conference caused him to realize that he would like to be on the energy and education committees, instead of what he had previously selected.
The conference attendees agreed with Barletta, who said, “It was a great opportunity to hear about policy and become more educated on the issues we’ll be confronting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like so many Harvard undergraduates, when Jennifer L. Levye ’11 arrived at Harvard almost four years ago, she was initially set on being pre-med. But her longtime interest in the environment lingered, and after discovering the Harvard Forest Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program later that year, she became interested in gaining research experience through the ecology program.
Although Levye was too late to apply, she followed her passion and took an ecology course and an introductory Organismic and Evolutionary Biology course her sophomore year and finally applied for the REU program. Her interests began to wander away from pre-med and toward ecology. After spending the next summer at Harvard Forest, she abandoned her pre-med requirements to focus solely on ecology research.
Harvard Forest’s REU program gives students from universities across the country, sometimes with little to no ecology research experience, the opportunity to conduct projects for 12 weeks during the summer.
Through independent research, which results in a final paper and presentation, the 20 to 35 students in the program gain skills and scientific knowledge and are supported by a network of mentors and their fellow students, resulting in what many say is a life-changing experience.
“I started out pre-med. After Harvard Forest, I realized I liked trees more than I liked studying people,” Levye says.
In addition to her passion for trees, Levye discovered a small, tight-knit academic community. In the Forest—70 miles away from Harvard’s campus—the former pre-med found her academic calling and a group to support her.
ROOTS OF FOREST
Harvard Forest, located in Petersham, Mass., was established in 1907 as a self-sustaining laboratory for Harvard’s Forestry Department and has since expanded to 3500 acres of land with research facilities. In 1998, it became part of the Long Term Ecological Research Network, a group of 26 research sites that share data and mainly receives its funding from the National Science Foundation.
“Being a part of the network gives us funding, infrastructure, and community. We also get to have projects that run for multiple decades looking at the Forest,” says Clarisse M. Hart, outreach and development manager for education and research programs at Harvard Forest.
Although students have been involved with the Forest since its foundation, David R. Foster, Harvard Forest’s director, started the REU program in 1985. Since then, student researchers have become a cornerstone of the Forest.
“We’re working on projects in the fall and the spring, but during the summer, the Forest becomes more of a hustling and bustling place,” says Edythe Ellin, Harvard Forest’s director of administration.
CLOSE MENTORING, CLOSE COMMUNITY
As a first step in the process, students apply for a particular project which has been developed by a REU mentor. If admitted, students work with the mentor for the duration of the summer. Students develop close relationships with their mentors, which often extend beyond the REU program.
Levye was unsure of which project to apply for, so she went to OEB Professor Noel “Missy” Holbrook, who was leading a project, to ask for advice. Ultimately, Holbrook became Levye’s mentor for the summer and for the rest of her college career.
Levye continued to work in Holbrook’s lab and Holbrook has since become her thesis advisor.
Holbrook, a professor of forestry at Harvard, has been a mentor since 1996. She leads projects with REU students and her doctorate or graduate students.
“I choose students who will be an asset to the project and who show a lot of initiative. [Levye] hadn’t done any research, but she worked in theater on the set and lighting crew. That’s an example where you think on your feet,” Holbrook says.
Even students outside of Harvard connect with mentors early on. Relena Ribbons, who attended the program in 2008, is a 2010 graduate of Wellesley College. Her project involved studying the effects of insect infestation on hemlock forests in Connecticut.
“After I decided to apply I was already in contact with my advisor, [David A. Orwig]. I was already discussing his research. Making that contact was important,” Ribbons says.
The other researchers are also approachable for students, according to those involved with the program. Foster is a frequent presence as a mentor and an evening lecturer, and he also takes the students on a hike or a field trip every summer.
The REU program includes other events outside of research such as weekly seminars and workshops. Living in two houses throughout the summer, the students bond with each other on weeknights and weekends.
“I was kind of expecting to go into the program and be spending a lot of time by myself working on my project, but I had a lot of time to interact with the other students,” Ribbons says.
Although some projects, like Ribbon’s, take place away from the Harvard Forest, all students live there. Each year, students organize trips off-site such as hiking in the White Mountains.
“It’s like a summer camp for almost-grown-ups,” says David Diaz ’06, who first participated in the program in 2003.
ACADEMIC AWAKENINGS
The REU is open to all undergraduates and recently-graduated students. Participants come from a wide range of concentrations.
Diaz, at the time a history concentrator, was looking for a summer opportunity close to Boston and learned about Harvard Forest through an e-mail on his House list. He contacted Aaron M. Ellison, a senior research fellow in ecology at Harvard Forest, and learned about a project that involved identifying and counting ants.
“Few students have experience doing that at college,” Diaz says. “I’d always been good at science and math, but I never really considered it a career or a study option.”
Diaz’s experience motivated him to create a special concentration of environmental history. Now he works as a forest carbon associate at Ecosystem Marketplace, an environmental non-profit in Washington, D.C.
Although Ribbons was involved in research prior to the program, the REU pushed her to attend graduate school. Ribbons is pursuing a Master of Science in forest resources at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
“Harvard Forest was a good academic awakening, and after that I was a super-charged battery, ready to go,” Ribbons says. “Before I would just wander outside. After the REU program, I knew I was going to grad school.”
Alumni say the REU program was one of their best college experiences. Many students have returned to the Forest, while others have let the experience propel them into graduate school or careers in ecology.
Alumni also say that they have continued to benefit from the connections they made during the program.
“It’s not that often coming into your profession that you have a lot of connections,” Diaz says. “It’s very nice to have a network.”
LOOKING AHEAD
In order to be funded by NSF, the program must be continuously reinvented.
Administrators at the REU are hoping to encourage students to do more work in teams and engage in an interdisciplinary approach.
“We’re working on making the projects reach across even more programs at Harvard from history, biology, and computer science,” Foster says.
The Forest is hoping to foster this collaboration through a January term experience. Students will spend a week at Harvard Forest to learn about conservation in New England.
Compared to the REU program, students will focus on conservation from an interdisciplinary perspective and will be required to interpret the issues through a final presentation, which could take the form of artwork or historical analysis.
Furthermore, program alumni agree that the Harvard Forest is an underutilized resource at Harvard. Administrators hope that programs like the J-Term initiative will encourage more students to become involved.
“Most people don’t even know Harvard has a forest,” Levye says. “It’s a great resource. Whether or not you are doing research or science at all, it’s great to just go there.” “Most people don’t even know Harvard has a forest,” Levye says. “It’s a great resource. Whether or not you are doing research or science at all, it’s great to just go there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second year of the new academic calendar—which shifted the fall finals period to before winter break—student and faculty opinion remains mixed on the effects of the shortened semester.
“I personally like the old schedule better,” said Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw. “It gave students more time to reflect on their courses and synthesize the material before taking final exams.”
Social Studies Assistant Professor Andrew Jewett added that he was worried about the new schedule’s effects on the quality of student work.
“I’ve heard from a few people that students who have to write research papers for the fall aren’t budgeting enough time and, as a consequence, aren’t doing as good a job,” he said.
College Fellow in African American Studies Jason Sokol voiced a different opinion. “While students certainly have a lot of end-of-semester assignments, they do not appear overly stressed or overwhelmed,ę” he said. “They seem to be taking the workload in stride, and I am very confident in their ability to continue to perform at a high level.”
Most students said that while the new schedule puts more pressure on students during reading period, they preferred having a longer break to a longer work period.
“The semester will be stressful no matter what,” said Jamie L. Olson ’11. “It is better to have a true break than have more time for papers and such.”
Jeffrey B. Low ’11 said that he felt student stress levels are “back to normal” this year, after being elevated during last year’s reading period—the first year the calendar change took effect.
Despite having a year to adjust to the shortened exam period, few faculty members reported significantly altering their course loads.
“The only class I’m teaching now has no exams, only papers, so it’s not really been an issue.” said Assistant Professor in Psychology Joshua D. Greene.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor George V. Lauder also said that “no changes” had been made to Life Sciences 2, the class he co-teaches in the fall term.
Patrick A. Gordon ’11 said that he observed little change in the way faculty approached the shortened schedules.
“Most professors just cram it into the smaller time. They cover the same material and assign the same stuff.”
In dealing with the time crunch, Gordon said that he tried to “focus more during term-time.”
Low said he felt that professors made some adjustments this year to compensate for the schedule change. “Last year, the professors hadn’t quite figured it out,”ę he said. “I think professors learned from last year and paid better attention to spreading out assignments.”
Physics Lecturer David Morin pointed out that students had always faced the same time pressure in the spring semester that they do now in the shorter fall semester.
“The present schedule isn’t totally new territory—it just makes the fall terms similar to what the spring terms have always been like,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Empty SUVs and tearful goodbyes—the scene is a familiar one for the many students arriving at Harvard each year. Parents drive away, slip into cabs, or disappear into a subway station, leaving students to face a new town, a new roommate, and the long-awaited ideal of life at college.
For those unaccustomed to independence, the college experience presents an entirely new lifestyle and sense of responsibility—whether they are ready for it or not.
Students face tough choices during their first year—both in academics and extracurricular activities—all the while adjusting to the challenges and rigors of Harvard’s arguably intense freshman year.
While the College makes an effort to support first years when they arrive, certain students walk on campus with a built in support network—their siblings.
For freshmen like Petra B. Janney ’14 and Alex M. Stanton ’14, the transition to life at Harvard was less overwhelming—and in more ways than one.
This fall, the two girls joined older brothers Niall M. Janney ’12 and Michael J. Stanton ’13 at Harvard, with these brothers not only becoming a source of familiarity and advice but also the girls’ teammates on Harvard’s swimming and diving team.
But going to school with one’s older sibling has its caveats. Having an older brother in the same zip-code may ease the transition to college, but it can also mean an occasionally watchful eye and a looming presence.
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT
For some freshmen, contact with advisers is limited, partially because some students are paired with academic advisers outside their specific field of interest. For Petra and Alex, this is where a sibling at Harvard can make all the difference.
The Advising Programs Office provides freshmen with a network of advisers—a proctor, a freshman academic adviser, a peer advising fellow, and a resident dean of freshmen. According to the APO, these advisers are supposed to provide first-year students with resources for both academic and non-academic advice.
But even with the APO’s extensive advising network, it is hard to compete with a sibling’s advice.
“Niall knows me much better than my advisor. Though he has been here for a shorter amount of time, he knows how to help me personally,” Petra says. “He’s also involved in the same sport as me, so he has dealt with a lot of my specific concerns.”
Alex described her brother’s role as very similar, especially early in the semester. “He really helped me adjust, and any question I had I knew I could go to him and he had been through something similar,” she says. “And with diving, he helped me figure out my routine and schedule.”
‘I KNOW WHAT GUYS THINK’
But Niall, Petra’s older brother, admits he had some apprehensions about having his sister join him in a college social environment.
“There were concerns because I had never really hung out with her in a social setting,” he admits. “At home you’re kind of in a family setting, and it’s more of a family relationship.”
But Niall says that being in a college setting has allowed him to see a side of his sister he never knew before.
“The only problem is that I’m super protective,” Niall admits. “So as much as I love going out and partying with Petra, I have to grit my teeth a little bit because I’m a guy and I know what guys think.”
And while having a protective older brother as a part of college social life would frustrate some, Petra says it doesn’t bother her.
“I know he is there whenever I need him and that is more important than worrying about him being overprotective,” she says. “I see it as support more than protection because I know he will be there no matter what.”
THE COLLEGE RELATIONSHIP
In high school, Alex and her brother Michael became close friends and started moving in the same social circle. With only a year separating them, what began as a close brother-sister relationship became a tight-knit friendship.
“Our group of friends overlapped a lot and we were friends with each other’s friends,” she says. “It got to a point that I could call his best friends to hang out even if he wasn’t there.”
And this year is no different. “I have become friends with all his friends again,” she says. “They have all become extended brothers to me, just like it was in high school.”
Michael agrees and says that having Alex join him this September was like falling back into old routines.
“It was like having one of my best friends from high school coming to college with me, except a year late,” he says. “Our relationship has stayed the exact same.”
But for Niall and Petra being together at college has changed their relationship.
“I feel like we relate to each other better here,” Petra says. “I don’t really know why.”
Niall shares similar feelings. “In the short time we’ve been here, we have already become so much closer,” he says. “I think it’s because we can rely on each other and we know we have each other’s backs.”
But such a close relationship can have its drawbacks with an older brother’s presence hanging over his younger sister.
“His friends will call me ‘little Stanton,’ but I don’t just want to be seen as Michael’s little sister,” Alex says. “I think it is important to make sure people see me as a different person.”
Petra shared the same concern. “I guess the worst thing about having a sibling at Harvard is that a lot of people know me as ‘Niall’s little sister’,” she says. “It doesn’t bother me that much, but it gets annoying if that’s the only way people know me.”
But Niall and Michael say that having their younger sisters on campus has its benefits for them.
“If I ever really need to talk to someone I can call Alex and she can come over and just chill, whether I’m bored, anxious, upset, anything,” Michael says. “Last year I would call her occasionally, but this year she is literally right there.”
Niall shares similar sentiments. “When you hit that low, or better yet that all-time high, there is someone there to congratulate you,” he says. “It hasn’t happened to me yet, but it is just comforting to know that my sister is here for whatever happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The modern day implications of the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education court case—the topic of Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow’s recent book—were discussed in a conference Saturday afternoon.
The event, which featured professors from Harvard, Yale, and NYU, marks the second collaboration between the Law School and the Humanities Center at Harvard.
The conference’s two panel discussions addressed what Humanities Center Director Homi K. Bhabha called “the thorny issues of integration, choice, and inequality” in the American educational system.
Minow said she was “thrilled” about the event. “This is the kind of thing you dream about happening—people reading what you wrote and discussing it,” she said.
Randall L. Kennedy, Harvard law professor and former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, noted  that while numerous books have been written on the important court case, Minow’s book adds to the discussion by “dramatically enlarging the frame in which we see Brown.”
Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who said she attended segregated schools in Atlanta until the age of 14, said that she felt a personal connection to the book.
“I and my classmates wondered why we did not have new books or swimming pools...in the schools, racial tensions were on display on the playing field and in classroom encounters that are too numerous to list,” Hammonds said. “I’m glad that Martha wrote this book. In a deeply personal way, it reminded me of how much my parents’ generation was deeply invested in Brown.”
Bhabha said the conference made him realize that he had also been “bused” to school as a child.
Bhabha described how he travelled from his home in Bombay, India to a nearby Roman Catholic Jesuit school.
“Full disclosure—I was ‘bused’ in a private car with a chauffeur,” Bhabha added to the audience’s amusement, but he clarified by saying that many of the socioeconomic tensions that existed in segregated America were also on display in India.
Bhabha said he felt the conference was an enriching experience for all the attendees.
“I certainly came away from it with a much richer understanding of the issues of equality, integration, and choice in their legal, political, social, and ethical dimensions,” he wrote in an e-mail.
Audience members echoed his sentiments.
“While the panel asked more questions than it answered, it was interesting to hear lawyers’ perspectives on these issues,” said Jennifer M. Huntington, who worked in the public education system as both a teacher and a principal for 27 years.
While Huntington said she was disappointed that there were no public school educators on the panel, she added, “I’m definitely going to go buy a copy of Minow’s book now!”
While there are no specific joint events currently planned between the Law School and the Humanities Center in the near future, Bhabha said in an e-mail that the partnership is “a thriving collaboration that will certainly continue.  Dean Minow and I are both committed to giving the ‘legal humanities’ a robust presence on campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing  body—announced today an overhaul to its governance structure that would  nearly double its membership and impose term limits.
The reforms—the  first major structural change since the Corporation was founded in  1650—include boosting the number of members from seven to 13 and  creating several new committees to address issues including finance,  governance, capital planning and facilities. The change brings the  Corporation's structure closer in line with the governing bodies of  other major universities.
Laid out in a report of the Corporation's Governance Review Committee released today, the reforms come on the heels of heavy criticism from some faculty and alumni levied  against the Corporation for a lack of transparency, accountability, and  community engagement. The reforms partly address these criticisms,  senior fellow of the Corporation Robert D. Reischauer ’63 said in an  interview Sunday.
By increasing the number of members on the Corporation, the body will be  better able to meet with members of the Harvard community and increase  the exchange of information between itself and the University it  governs, Reischauer said.
The larger membership will also allow for individuals on the Corporation  to focus on issues related to their area of expertise, potentially  increasing the breadth and depth of the body’s work, he said.
“There’s  sort of a 'Goldilocks solution'—the addition of a very few people would  not have solved the issue of capacity and diversity of expertise,” said  Harvard Graduate School of Education professor Richard P. Chait, an  expert on higher education governance who advised the Corporation on its  reforms. “Too many would have changed the character of the group from  the intimate group.”
Chait added even with its expanded membership, Harvard's Corporation  will remain the smallest among its peers. The body will continue to select its own members, and intends to choose the new six over the next two to three years.
University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview Sunday the  ongoing selection process for the new members of the Corporation will  incorporate feedback from the Harvard community, potentially addressing  concerns that the body has grown too insular.
“When we search for members of the Corporation we do a lot of outreach,  we talk to people about: ‘What does the Corporation need? What issues  should we be considering?’” Faust said. “I think that looking for new  Corporation members on a regular basis is going to be one of the avenues  of constant communication.”
With only seven members, the Corporation has previously included its  entire membership in the organization’s work, and the creation of  committees to focus on particular issues is a major departure from its  past structure.
The reforms also include term limits for Corporation members. Fellows  will now be limited to six years in office with the possibility of a  six-year extension, though the report of the Governance Review Committee stated that "some adjustmentswill likely be necessary to assure appropriately staggered periods of service" as the body grows to its larger size.
Reischauer  said the review’s launch in the fall of 2009 was part of and motivated  by a broader University effort to re-examine its policies in the  aftermath of the financial crisis—a moment for self-reflection for the  broader University community.
“The fact is that all parts of the University have been asked to look  themselves in the mirror, reassess how they might do their job to the  optimal degree, and it’s only natural that we should do the same thing,”  Reischauer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six-hundred ninety days—that’s how long it’s been since the Harvard women’s squash team (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) last lost a match.
Since their heartbreaking 5-4 loss to Ivy foe Princeton in the 2009 CSA National Championship, the women of the Crimson squad have gone a perfect 17-0.
More impressive, the crew has garnered two-thirds of its victories in 9-0 sweeps.
The most recent win came this Saturday at the Belkin International Squash Courts, where No. 1 Harvard faced No. 7 Cornell (1-3, 0-3). Dropping only four games, the Crimson easily toppled the Big Red, 9-0, in Cornell’s home opener.
“We just wanted to go out there and play well and wrap up the first part of the season before New Year’s,” sophomore Sarah Mumanachit said.
And play well they did.
“The match went very well,” captain Alisha Mashruwala said. “It was probably the best I’ve seen the girls play, and myself, too.”
One of the gutsiest performances of the day was undoubtedly from Nirasha Guruge.
The junior faced Big Red sophomore Jaime Laird in the No. 2 slot—an unexpected matchup, since Laird has played predominantly in the top position since her rookie season.
After dropping the first frame, 11-3, Guruge adjusted her game and was able to come back and quickly capture the next two games, 12-10 and 11-3.
But after Laird nabbed an 11-4 victory in the fourth set, the match was pushed to five games—the first five-game match of the season for Harvard.
The Crimson team’s calm, collected demeanor was quite useful, then, in helping Guruge hang on for the win.
“We were pretty confident going into the match,” Mashruwala said. “The team takes it...one step at a time.”
Guruge kept her cool and snagged an 11-9 fifth-frame triumph.
She and sophomore No. 5 Natasha Kingshott, who claimed a 3-0 victory in the court next door, set the tone for their teammates that followed.
Sophomore Laura Gemmell, who has yet to drop a single match in her collegiate career, hit the court after Guruge and Kingshott and faced off against Cornell freshman Jesse Pacheco in the No. 1 match.
Gemmell continued her string of three-game victories—she has yet to drop a game in regular season play—and defeated Pacheco, 11-3, 11-2, 11-4.  It was the third loss for Pacheco, who thus far has seen action only in the No. 2 slot.
Mumanachit and junior Cece Cortes also took to the courts in the final round of play, and both women churned out 3-0 sweeps in the No. 4 and No. 7 positions, respectively.
“I think everyone was pretty happy with how she played,” Mumanachit said of her team’s performance.
Mashruwala agreed with her teammate’s assessment.
“The girls were very fired up,” she said. “We knew playing Cornell is always an important match...everyone played very good squash.”
Mashruwala, for her part, started off the match alongside senior Bethan Williams and junior June Tiong.
Mashruwala and Williams both blanked their opponents, 3-0, playing No. 3 and No. 9, respectively.
At No. 6, Tiong recovered from a first-frame loss to beat Big Red junior and co-captain Lauren Sachvie, 8-11, 11-2, 11-4, 11-7.
With the first half of the season over, the ladies now have over a month until their next match against Bates.
But the team is careful to stay motivated with tough matches looming in the second half of the season.
“We’re looking forward to the competition after New Year’s,” said Mumanachit. “Those will be the bigger matches and the true test of our capabilities.”
To that end, the squad is determined to stave off the pressure of recapturing last year’s national title.
“The most important thing is that we haven’t been thinking about last year at all,” Mashruwala said of this season’s success and the team’s future goals. “We started this season with a new slate...We’re looking at it one match at a time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team (3-2, 2-1 Ivy) entered its weekend contests on a three-game undefeated streak, the Crimson suffered its first two losses of the season on the road against sixth-ranked Cornell (3-1, 2-1) and third-ranked Rochester (5-0, 3-0 Liberty League).
“Losing to Cornell was a really bad loss for us,” captain Reed Endresen said. “I think we are a much better team than them. It’s a tough one to swallow, but we rebounded [against Rochester].”
ROCHESTER 9, HARVARD 0
Just over 24 hours after a loss against the Big Red, Harvard attempted to rebound against its second opponent of the weekend, the Yellowjackets.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, Rochester remains undefeated on the season after handing Harvard its second loss, 9-0.
“[Yesterday’s] match was a very tough match,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “I feel the score line does not do credit to how well the team played.”
“They fought much more than [on Saturday], so I was very proud of every last one of them,” he continued. “There were some very tight matches that went right down to the wire.”
Sophomore Zeke Scherl nearly defeated the Yellowjackets’ Juan Pablo Gaviria after battling for five games.
“He fought like a tiger,” Way said. “He had match ball in the fourth game to win the match, and it didn’t come to pass.”
Another outstanding performance for the Crimson came from freshman Nigel Koh, who also took his opponent, Rochester senior Will Newnham, to a fifth game in an exciting match.
“Nigel was up against a very difficult opponent,” Way said. “He had to maintain his calm, and I think he did a fantastic job.”
Although the Yellowjackets won all nine matchups, Harvard won 10 games against Rochester, with six matchups going to at least four games.
“I was very proud of the team,” Way said. “They gave it all they had, and I thought it was a terrific bounce back, even though the score was 9-0.”
“Rochester is a pretty talented team,” captain Reed Endresen continued.  “We played them with a lot of heart, a lot of passion.”
CORNELL 7, HARVARD 2
A slight favorite against Cornell, Harvard came into Saturday’s matchup knowing it would face a tough opponent in its first road contest of the year.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, the Big Red took an early lead over Harvard, winning the first three matches of the day at the No. 3, No. 6, and No. 9 spots, respectively, on the way to a 7-2 victory over the Crimson.
“The men fell a little bit flat against Cornell,” Way said. “The Cornell men’s team is very strong, and they have a good shot at both titles—the Ivy League title and the national title. We were a little flat coming out of the gate.”
Endresen earned one of Harvard’s two wins against the Big Red, defeating Cornell junior David Hilton in three games at the No. 5 spot.
The Crimson’s other victory came in the No. 4 matchup, as Koh took sophomore Arjun Gupta in five games.
Despite the score of the match, individual contests were closer than they appeared, as Harvard won a total of 11 games on the day.
Scherl narrowly lost his five-game match against Cornell sophomore Rishi Jalan, despite winning the first two games.
“They felt very down in the dumps [Saturday],” Way said. “[Yesterday] they had to redeem themselves.”
Though it was the Crimson’s first loss of the season, the match against the Big Red does not remove Harvard from Ivy League title contention.
“We can still win [the title] if we win out because Cornell lost to Princeton,” Endresen said. “So we’re still in the race, still in the hunt.”
Though the weekend results were disappointing for the Crimson, Harvard remains optimistic about the rest of the season.
“We were confident that we could beat [both Rochester and Cornell],” senior Richard Hill said. “But they showed they were the better teams this weekend.”
“We’re going back to the drawing board and talking with the coaches,” Hill continued. “A lot of really important matches aren’t until February.  It’s only the first half of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its loss against Holy Cross last Sunday, the Harvard women’s basketball team was looking to rebound in a big way. The fact that its next game was the team’s home opener and took place in front of a packed Lavietes Pavilion—students clad in matching white shirts—provided all the more motivation.
The Crimson (4-2) would not disappoint the raucous home crowd of 1,202, as it used a balanced attack to overwhelm Hartford (1-7) in an 85-61 rout Friday night.
“I’m very happy,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “Our last outing was pretty disappointing. And I thought we responded the way we were supposed to. We knew we were better, and it was important for us to start strong and I thought we did.”
“We were really hungry for a win to bounce back after last weekend,” sophomore guard Victoria Lippert added. “So we had a good week of practice; we were really fired up to be at home for our first game, and that energy carried over.”
Harvard looked crisp from the get-go. Freshman guard Christine Clark drove baseline down the left side on back-to-back plays to help build an early Crimson lead, while senior forward Emma Markley set the tone defensively, blocking two shots on back-to-back plays in the opening minutes.
Three-pointers from Lippert and junior guard Brogan Berry, along with a breakaway layup, put the Crimson up 25-13.
“We had a couple slow starts [in the past]—so starting off strong was [important]—it really just gives us momentum early on in the game,” Berry said.
Sophomore guard Elle Hagedorn drove into the lane and beat the buzzer off a layup to give Harvard a 39-26 advantage going into halftime.
The Hawks came out of the break strong, rattling off six straight points. A three from sophomore guard Alex Hall pulled Hartford to within eight points, at 44-36 with 16:20 left in the game.
But the Crimson would respond. Ignited by a layup from Markley, Harvard went on a 15-6 run, including 11 straight points from Lippert. The run was capped by a fast break layup from sophomore guard Jasmine Evans.
“I thought we survived the runs of momentum in the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “The little runs they had at us—and we did it by rebounding, and we did it by defense.”
“We really wanted to bury them right at the start of the half and not let them chip into our lead,” Lippert said. “So we really wanted to stop three-pointers, and buckle down on defense, and just get stops. They had a few threes, but we were able to extend it in the second half.”
Keyed by a layup from Clark and a triple from co-captain Christine Matera, Harvard went on an 18-6 run, earning its biggest lead of the game at 79-51 with 3:25 left on the clock.
Four Harvard players scored in double digits on the night. Lippert led all scorers with 21 points off 9-for-13 shooting including 3-4 from behind the arc.
Markley—who was honored before the game for scoring 1,000 career points—earned her first double-double of the season, garnering 16 points and 10 rebounds while blocking three shots.
Berry had 13 points and distributed the ball well, dishing out five assists.
Clark was active at all ends of the floor, scoring 11 points, pulling down three rebounds, and grabbing a pair of steals.
“I was pretty happy with our team defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “And I was pretty happy with our balanced scoring and our team work…we haven’t been balanced, so that was good.”
Stifling man-to-man defense from the Crimson left the Hawks looking disorganized on offense, shooting 35.8 percent from the field for the game. Harvard also outworked Hartford on the glass, pulling down 42 rebounds to 25. The Crimson shot 52.4 percent from the field, including 37.5 percent from behind the arc.
“Overall, it was just a great team victory,” Berry said. “And the only reason I got my shots was because my teammates were giving me the open passes—it was really a team effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard rank and file was donning its formal wear this past weekend, the women’s swimming and diving team packed its water gear and headed south to the Georgia Invitational in Athens. After three consecutive road wins against Ivy League competition, the Crimson prepared to face its toughest challenge yet—a competition roster featuring four nationally-ranked teams, including the second-ranked Georgia Lady Bulldogs.
But Harvard applied the same mantra that has been at the core of its success throughout the season and responded to the invitational’s high caliber with some of its own. At the end of three days of events, the Crimson swam away with four new school records and a sixth-place finish in the meet with 261 points overall. Meanwhile, the Georgia host team clinched the title with 1,115 points.
“Coming down to Georgia and facing teams like UGA and UVA, we knew the competition was going to be pretty stiff,” co-captain Ali Slack said. “This weekend’s performances were something to get us going. We had some amazing swims, and that’s something we can take back with us to Boston.”
Slack had reason to celebrate as she combined with senior Katy Hinkle and freshmen Sarah Li and Jenna Gregoire to break the school record in the 200-yard freestyle relay with a time of 1.32.49. Hinkle further added momentum to the meet’s first day with an individual record-breaking performance in the 50-yard freestyle, touching in at 22.87 seconds in the preliminary round. With this performance, Hinkle clinched a spot in the final A category, where she ultimately finished in fifth place with an NCAA B cut. The Crimson closed out Friday’s events in sixth place with 99 points.
On the second day of competition, junior Meghan Leddy sustained the tide of Harvard’s success, shaving .05 seconds off the previous school record in the 100-yard backstroke in a 55.18 finish and adding a record-breaking effort in the 200-yard backstroke.
“Watching Katy’s and Meghan’s performances, it was hard not to get caught up in the excitement and jump in the pool to perform well yourself,” co-captain Christine Kaufmann said.
Next up, the quartet of Hinkle, Gregoire, Li, and junior Margaret Fish earned ninth place in the 200-yard medley relay in 1:44.12. The 800-yard freestyle relay combination of Li, seniors Katherine Pickard and Kate Mills, and junior Catherine Zagroba chimed in with a 10th-place finish to close out the day’s events.
The Crimson entered the final round of the invitational on Sunday still in sixth place, sitting ahead of the University of Minnesota. Kaufmann’s 13th-place finish in the 1,650 freestyle in a time of 16:53.71 added 15 points to Harvard’s tally. Freshman Paige Newell and Zagroba came in behind Kaufmann in the same race in 17th and 18th place, respectively. Mills and Leddy gave the Crimson its best performances of the day: Mills completed the 200-yard butterfly in 1:59.40, good for fifth place, and Leddy contributed 15 points with a fourth-place finish in the 200-yard backstroke in a time of 1:55.60.
“I think the most important thing at this point [of the season] is to show that we can swim in all conditions,” Kaufmann said. “We did it in our league. And now, racing well against some of the top competition in the country shows off just how hard we’ve been training.”
The Georgia Invitational was also notable for its strong contributions from the freshman class, as both Gregoire and Li contributed to school-record shattering races in their first collegiate appearances on the national stage.
“It’s always great to see the freshmen swim well,” Pickard said. “They’ve really brought a new mindset to this team. Their success is exciting for us, and we’re definitely going to need them by the end of the season.”
At the midway point of its schedule, Harvard has already amassed an impressive record against Ivy and non-Ivy competition. In addition to the Georgia meet, the Crimson deployed two separate contingents this past weekend to the MIT Invitational, where Harvard secured second place with 772 points behind MIT’s 1,045, and the Texas Invitational, which witnessed strong performances from the Crimson diving squad. Freshman Schuyler Moore led the way with a 16th-place finish in the three-meter dive during the preliminary round with a score of 254.40.
“We’re going to use these good performances to go into training,” Pickard said. “The next two months are the hardest of our training schedule. We’ll use the positive feedback, and hopefully more records will be broken with the championship meets in February.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rewind to Feb. 2, 2010: the nationally-ranked Harvard women’s hockey team, which was in the midst of a season that culminated in an NCAA quarterfinals appearance, routed unranked Boston College, 5-0, in the Beanpot opener.
Now fast-forward to yesterday afternoon: in a reversal from last season, the unranked Crimson (4-5-2, 4-2-2 ECAC) fell to the No. 6 Eagles, 6-2, at Conte Forum. Harvard’s matchup against BC (11-2-4, 6-1-2 Hockey East) marks the end of a five-game stretch against nationally-ranked opponents.
In the course of the game, though the Crimson played well offensively, crucial defensive miscues and solid goaltending from BC goaltender Molly Schaus proved to be the recipe for Harvard’s downfall.
“BC is a very good team,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We made mistakes, and they were good enough to capitalize on it. We did some nice things offensively—we had some good chances—but their goaltender was tremendous. So we could clean up a few things, because we caused a lot of our own headaches.”
With the drop of the puck in the first period, the Crimson initially kept pace with the Eagles, matching BC offensively. Though the Eagles would strike first with 12:09 on the clock as senior BC forward and Olympian Kelli Stack slipped a goal into the net off a breakaway, Harvard would respond in kind nine minutes later. Tri-captain Kate Buesser flicked a wrist shot past the Eagles’ goalie to tie up the match, with fellow captain Leanna Coskren recording the assist.
At the end of the first period, both teams found themselves in a statistical stalemate, with Harvard holding a slight advantage in shots, 12-9.
But with the start of the second period, the host team gained control of the match. In the span of 12 minutes, the Eagles’ offense tallied three unanswered goals to gain a 4-1 advantage.
Leading the potent BC offense was Stack, who tallied two more goals—one early and one late in the second period—to register a hat trick for the game. Stack scored her second goal of the match with 14:30 to play in the second period with a skillful deke against sophomore Crimson goaltender Laura Bellamy to put the Eagles ahead by one.
Three minutes later, a defensive miscue from Harvard would help BC to score again. Capitalizing on a poor pass in the Crimson defensive zone, Eagle forward Mary Restuccia flicked a wrist shot into the upper right corner of the net to increase the lead to two. Stack would then complete her hat trick off a two-on-one rush with 4:30 left in the second to give BC a commanding three-goal lead.
The second period was marked as much by the Crimson’s inability to capitalize on power-play opportunities as it was for the Eagles’ offensive surge. Though Harvard was gifted with two power-play opportunities off holding and bodychecking penalties from the Eagles, the pressure from the Harvard offense—which recorded six shots in the frame—was not enough to solve Schaus.
“It’s easier to kill a penalty than it is to score a power-play goal,” Stone said. “However, we were getting some better looks at the net and moving the puck better.”
As play entered the third period, the power-play woes of the Crimson continued, as it was only able to capitalize on one of its four man-up opportunities in the final period.
Less than three minutes into the third period, the Eagles scored again, as BC forward Melissa Bizzari slid the puck past Bellamy, but Harvard responded to bring the score to 5-2.
In the midst of its first power-play opportunity of the period, senior forward Katharine Chute poked a pass in the direction of sophomore defender Josephine Pucci, who then fired a one-timer into the Eagles’ net.
With Pucci’s goal, the Harvard offense sprung back to life, pressuring deep into the BC defensive zone and working the Eagles’ goaltender. But Schaus once again proved to be unbeatable, as she saved 25 out of the 27 shots the Crimson offense fired at her in the game.
BC’s Ashley Motherwell would add an insurance goal with 1:58 left on the clock to give the Eagles the 6-2 win.
Though Harvard would leave the match with an advantage in shots, 27-18, the performances of BC’s two Olympians—Stack’s hat trick and Schaus’s goaltending—proved insurmountable for the Crimson.
“It was a tough ending for us, for sure,” Pucci said. “It’s obviously a bit discouraging, losing, 6-2, but all we can do now is look forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Las Vegas is certainly known for its glitz and glamour, and on a trip to Sin City this weekend, Harvard’s top wrestlers got the chance to shine. Once again taking on some of the nation’s best talent at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational, two Crimson grapplers finished in the top four as the squad approaches the end of its fall individual season.
“I think everyone did well,” junior Corey Jantzen said. “We made a lot of adjustments from our last competition, and our results definitely improved.”
Jantzen continued his tradition of strong showings in Las Vegas, finishing second at 149 lbs. The seventh-ranked grappler took home the individual title at 141 lbs. two seasons ago, and only a narrow 4-2 loss to Jason Chamberlain in the finals kept Jantzen from repeating his feat.
“His last bout was tough,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “It could have gone either way, and he could have won that match.”
Still, the junior grappler was far from disappointed, as his unblemished run to the semifinals showed how far he has come after taking a year off. The transition from freestyle wrestling back to collegiate competition has forced Jantzen to work for each victory.
“I just haven’t had to wrestle much top or bottom wrestling, because in freestyle you’re mostly on your feet,” Jantzen explained. “One area where I definitely need to improve is my bottom wrestling. I need to be able to get escape points, [for example] in the finals. If I get out, I win that match.”
Although Jantzen came up short in the finals, he breezed through the early rounds in dominant fashion. The Crimson grappler rode a 19-2 win and a fall in just 27 seconds into the quarterfinals, where he edged out No. 18 Cole Schmitt of Wisconsin, 4-3. After an easy semifinal win, Jantzen had made good on his No. 2 seeding.
But the junior was not the only Crimson wrestler to compete well in Las Vegas. Sophomore co-captain Walter Peppelman (157) showed his resilience on the mat, rebounding from a second-round loss to reel off five straight victories in the consolation bracket. Peppelman fought all the way back to the third-place bout, where he dropped a 5-1 decision to Navy’s Bryce Saddoris to claim fourth overall.
“Once you get caught in the wrestleback, it’s just constant matches,” Weiss said. “I think [Peppelman] bounced back like the leader he is...He beat a number of guys, which is really going to help him wrestle with more confidence.”
After a loss to sixth-seeded Peter Yates of Virginia Tech ended the Crimson co-captain’s quest for a title, Peppelman maintained his focus in the consolation bouts. Following two easy wins and a medical forfeit, the 11th-seeded sophomore found himself challenging a higher-ranked grappler again, this time with better results. Purdue’s Colton Salazar represented Peppelman’s third Big Ten opponent in a row, but the seventh seed could not keep pace with his Harvard foe. Peppelman edged out a 5-4 decision to guarantee himself a spot in the top six, and the co-captain wasn’t done yet. Peppelman faced off against No. 3 seed Colt Sponseller in the consolation semifinals, and once again showed his potential to hang with even the most talented wrestlers. Peppelman cruised to a 9-2 upset in what would be his final victory on Saturday afternoon.
“[I just had to] focus on one match, one position at a time,” Peppelman said of his run through the wrestleback. “The coaches did a really good job of keeping my focus...It’s just a mentality and a mindset.”
In addition to the solid performances of its two standouts, the Crimson took encouragement from its continued youth movement, which saw three sophomores and two freshmen post at least one victory at the invitational.
Rookie Cameron Croy (184) had the best showing among the team’s first-year grapplers, going 3-2 over the weekend. Croy fell in his second bout to second-seed A.J. Kissel, 6-0, but rebounded with 19-7 and 4-2 wins in consolation matches. Illinois’ Tony Dallago ended the day for Croy with a 10-2 major decision, but Weiss was pleased with his rookie’s effort.
“Cameron just keeps getting better and better,” the coach said. “He was real close to placing.”
Fellow rookie Ian Roy (174) earned a win in his first consolation bout, and sophomores Adam Hogue (165) and Shay Warren (133) also picked up a victory each. Second-year grappler Steven Keith (125) faced a tough assignment against top seed and eventual champion Anthony Robles of Arizona State, but the Crimson sophomore managed a 2-2 record on the weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you haven’t been paying attention to the Harvard men’s swimming and diving squad so far, now would be the time to start. The Crimson has not lost in its first five events—a feat only one other Harvard athletics team has accomplished this year—and is showing no signs of stopping any time soon.
This weekend, the Crimson traveled to Boston, Mass., and Storrs, Conn., to compete in its first two non-conference meets of 2010-11. Harvard (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) kicked off the weekend on Friday afternoon with a dominant performance over Boston University to win, 156-106. The squad continued its streak against Connecticut on Saturday afternoon, this time in an even more impressive fashion, downing the Huskies, 182-118.
“It’s always tough to compete in back-to-back meets like that, but I think we did a good job keeping our focus from day to day,” co-captain Justin Davidson said. “We definitely had some guys who stepped up and had some pretty fast swims, especially considering we’re at the peak of our training right now. I’m really excited about our undefeated record.”
HARVARD 182, CONNECTICUT 118
The Crimson struggled slightly in the relay events, but like in past meets, the team stood out in the individual events to take down Connecticut for its fifth win of the season.
Sophomore Greg Roop kicked things off with his second victory of the weekend, taking the 1000-yard medley in 9:35.77—almost a full eight seconds ahead of any of his competitors. Senior Blake Lewkowitz and sophomore Matthew Kaminske grabbed second and third to give Harvard the lead for the first time.
The 100-yard backstroke turned out to be a much closer race, coming down to two Crimson teammates on the last lap. Freshman Jack Pretto started out the event in first, touching the wall at the first 50 meters just before junior Robert Newell. Newell gained slightly on Pretto to shave a few hundredths of a second off the freshman’s lead, but he could not pass him in time. Pretto kept his lead to take the event in a photo finish, just two hundredths of a second ahead of Newell.
In the second-to-last event, Harvard had already secured the win, but that did not stop the squad from taking the top three positions in the 200-yard individual medley. Junior Niall Janney stayed in front the whole race, posting a time of 1:54.52. Co-captain Douwe Yntema got off to a fast start, but Newell passed him during the race to overtake second, leaving Yntema to finish third.
HARVARD 156, BU 106
The Crimson opened the weekend with a victory over Boston University, its first non-conference opponents of the season. The divers got the team out to a quick lead in the diving competition, which took place earlier in the week. Senior Zac Ranta earned first in the one-meter event, and sophomore Michael Stanton took second place. In the three-meter competition, the two divers swapped positions, with Stanton grabbing first place and Ranta taking second.
“I think that we were consistent and that we performed well,” Ranta said. “There’s always room to improve, but we’re at a good part of the season right now.”
The divers gave the Crimson the early lead, but the freestyle events put Harvard over the top. The team placed first in five of the six events and completely commanded the first two individual events, boasting a 1-2-3 finish in both the 1000-yard freestyle and the 200-yard freestyle.
Roop gained an early lead in the event and stayed out in front the entire time to win the 1000-yard freestyle with a time of 9:39.34, his first of two victories during the weekend. Kaminske placed second, with junior Matthew McLean completing the sweep of the top three for Harvard.
In the 200-yard freestyle, sophomore Brendan McIntee finished the event in first after maintaining his lead for the whole race. Lewkowitz got off to a rough start behind his competitors after the first 50 meters, but the veteran turned on the heat in the last portion of the race. He managed to squeeze past freshman Will Brophy at the end of the race to take second place by one hundredth of a second.
Harvard has proven to be unstoppable so far this year, and with performances like these, the squad will be a challenge for any of its competitors in the pool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated 12/6/10 2:56 p.m.:
Competition can’t get much more intense when you’re facing teams that tout NCAA championship titles.
But that was the challenge faced by the Harvard fencing team this weekend as it took on five squads at the Sacred Heart Invitational in Fairfield, Conn.
The 5-0 victories claimed by the men and women, then, made the challenge look like a breeze.
“It was a really promising start to the season,” co-captain Hao Meng said. “Our coach was really pleased with the results.”
The Crimson squad was the only crew of seven to go undefeated by the end of the dual meets. En route to the victory, the team defeated Sacred Heart, Penn State, North Carolina, NYU, and Vassar—many of which boast top-notch fencers.
Princeton also fenced at the invitational, but Harvard coach Peter Brand made the decision to wait for the Ivy League Championships to face the Ivy foe, according to junior co-captain Valentin Staller.
On the men’s side, the high of the day was no doubt beating the defending NCAA champion Nittany Lions, 14-13.
“We beat them by a very close margin,” Meng explained.
“It was the first time we’ve beaten them in four years,” Staller said. “It was a phenomenal effort from everyone today.”
Part of the phenomenal effort was from none other than Staller himself. Going undefeated on the day, Staller won the final bout to claim the victory for the Crimson in the sabre.
“He was unbelievable,” Meng said. “A lot of fencers were bigger or taller, but he destroyed them. He was on fire all day, and he set an example for the rest of the team with his energy and determination.”
Indeed, Staller’s teammates definitely followed their co-captain’s lead—even without freshman Mike Raynis, an epée fencer currently competing at the Junior World Cup in Finland, the squad dominated its competitors.
Solid performances came in from junior epée James Hawrot, who went 12-3 on the day, and also from freshman foil Lucas Lin and fellow rookie Erik Arzoian in sabre.
The men’s crew also notched another impressive victory by downing the Brewers, 25-2.
“We all fenced well,” Staller said. “We had a strong team, so we were excited to show that.”
The women also showed their depth and strength in the day’s events.
“The girls beat [the Tar Heels], 27-0,” Meng said. “I don’t think that’s ever happened in the past 11 years since our coach started, or maybe in the history of Harvard fencing.”
Contributing to the sweep was an impressive contingent of fencers.
“On the women’s team, [junior co-captain and] defending NCAA sabre champion Caroline Vloka, [junior sabre and co-captain] Hayley Levitt, [freshman foil] Alexandra Kiefer, and [sophomore foil] Kathy Chou all only lost one bout,” Staller noted.
Meng in particular noted Kiefer’s impressive outing.
“She’s shown drastic improvement since she got here,” Meng said. “[Kiefer] definitely stepped it up today.”
The ladies also mirrored the men’s dominance with a similar score in their victory over Vassar—they lost only one more bout than their male counterparts to fell the Brewers, 24-3.
Against Penn State, the score was tighter, but the women still snagged the win, 16-11.
“They’re usually really good,” sophomore sabre Elena Helgiu said. “But right now...a lot of people aren’t there.”
In fact, both squads had their share of absentees, including teammates at other fencing competitions, like Raynis, and a Nittany Lion with a knee injury and another who is abroad, according to Helgiu.
Regardless, the day’s outcome proved quite promising as Harvard looks ahead to the Ivy League Championships in February and the NCAA regionals in early March.
“Our first goal, at the very beginning, was to win the Ivies,” Meng said.
With depth in each weapon group and a strong start to the season, capturing the Ancient Eight crown is a definite possibility.
“Our squad has no holes anywhere,” Meng concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All year long, a pair of running backs dominated Ivy League football. What wasn’t clear, though, was which one stood out as the Ancient Eight’s top tailback.
At season’s end, the debate still isn’t resolved. Harvard senior Gino Gordon shared the Asa S. Bushnell Cup, honoring the Ivy Player of the Year, with Dartmouth junior Nick Schwieger.
The co-winners, who were chosen from a field of four finalists by a vote of the Ancient Eight’s head coaches, were introduced at a reception at New York’s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel this morning.
“It is a great honor to win this award,” Gordon said at the press conference in New York. “I took a look at the names of past winners, and it is great to be sharing it with them, and it is also great to be sharing it with Nick, because he is a great athlete and a really great player.”
Gordon, who was voted Harvard’s most valuable player by his teammates last month, broke the 1,000-yard barrier for the first time this season, finishing the year with 1,059 yards on the ground—good for seventh-best all-time. He led the league in yards per carry with 6.3 and will leave as the Crimson’s career leader in that category (5.3).
He also ran for 10 touchdowns this season and 23 in his career.
“He was perhaps the best open-field runner in Harvard history,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said at the press conference. “What made Gino special, though, was the fact that he was the rare running back with no weaknesses. He was a great inside and outside runner. He was perhaps the best blocking back in Harvard history and was flexible enough to play wide receiver.”
Gordon’s co-winner, Schwieger, had the statistically better season of the two, leading the league in rushing for the second straight year with 1,133 yards and finding his way to the endzone 14 times. He finished the campaign sixth nationally with an average of 125.9 rushing yards per game, but perhaps more importantly, sparked an improving Dartmouth team to a 6-4 record, its first winning season in 13 years.
The two beat out Princeton senior wide receiver Trey Peacock and Penn sophomore quarterback Billy Ragone for the award.
Gordon and Schwieger are the third co-winners in the last 41 years, but 2010 marks the second straight season the Ivy League has named two players of the year after Penn’s Jake Lewko and Brown’s Buddy Farnham shared the prize last year.
Gordon is the first Harvard player since Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 to win the prize.
“I have had a lot of personal success, and I cherish that,” Gordon said. “But what really warms my heart is that I spent four years getting to know new players each year, creating a brotherhood where all of us struggled together, bled together, did everything together. It was a great experience, and I am so thankful to have been a part of it.”

The women’s College Squash Association has just released its preseason individual rankings for the 2010-11 season, and the results look very promising for the undefeated Harvard squash team (5-0, 3-0 Ivy).
The rankings, which cite the top 100 players, were compiled using the 2009-10 women’s final individual rankings as well as coach’s estimations of their players and their team’s line-ups.
The CSA also capped each team’s representation at 10 players.
The No. 1 Crimson definitely made a dent in the rankings—10 of the squad’s roster have made the list, with eight athletes falling in the top 50.
Sitting atop the rankings, sophomore Laura Gemmell has held onto her position from the end of last season. Directly below her is Trinity’s Pamela Hathway. The junior faced Gemmell last season in the CSA national individual championship match, falling after five drawn-out frames. If these rankings are a prediction of championship play to come, Gemmell and Hathway are on track for a heated rematch.
In seventh and ninth place are junior Nirasha Guruge and senior June Tiong, respectively, rounding out Harvard’s representation in the top 10. The only other school with three top-10 players is the Crimson’s toughest competition: Yale, which is currently No. 2 in the national rankings.
Also making the cut for Harvard are captain Alisha Mashruwala (13) and fellow senior Bethan Williams (29), sophomores Natasha Kingshott (17), Sarah Mumanachit (42), Vidya Rajan (51), and Eliza Calihan (82), and junior Cece Cortes (37).
Other crews that dominated the list are—no surprises here—Princeton and the aforementioned Bulldogs. Both teams also tout 10 top-100 players apiece. Penn, Stanford, and the Bantams also fared well, with nine players from each team making the cut.

Both women’s basketball freshman guard Christine Clark and men’s basketball freshman guard Laurent Rivard earned Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors this week, proving Harvard is definitely doing right by the new kids in Lavietes.
Clark, who holds the title for a second time this season, earned the nomination after helping the Crimson drive up the score in its home-opening victory over Hartford. The former McDonald’s All-American nominee scored in the double digits for her fifth straight game and managed to get three rebounds and two steals along the way.
Clark scored her first conference title in the week of Nov. 22, after she notched 12 points in a total of 26 minutes of play against Navy on Nov. 20.
Rivard’s performance was stellar in both of men’s basketball’s games last week. Last Wednesday against Fordham, Rivard helped Harvard win, 80-57, with a career-best 21 points, only to repeat his success three days later in the Crimson’s matchup against Michigan. Rivard added five three-pointers and another five rebounds to his season record in the narrow loss to the Wolverines.
Although they are the first two athletes to receive the honor on either team, both Rivard and Clark have been representing the Class of 2014 well this season, respectively maintaining the third and fourth highest points-per-game averages on their teams.

Harvard may be the number one university in the nation, but Sporcle—the addictive online quiz-based procrastination tool—placed Harvard at number 10 in its college rankings for the week of Nov. 21-27.
According to Sporcle, the rankings are computer generated and based on a number of factors for each school, including the number of visits per user, number of games played, number of page views, and average time spent on the site.
In that week’s ranking, Harvard climbed nine spots from the week of Nov. 14-20, which ranked us at number 19.
The Universities of Michigan and Maryland held the top two spots for those two weeks. Other Ivies, like Yale, failed to even make the list.
Ian Henry, Public Relations Associate at Sporcle, wrote an e-mail to Flyby stating that before the site even began publishing the list, "Harvard consistently ranked in our Top 25 schools."
Henry suggested that to boost their school’s ranking, students should tell their friends about Sporcle and use the site more themselves.
So may we suggest Economics Grab Bag as a study tool for that Ec10 final?  Or better yet, The Best Finals Procrastination Websites is a good way to put off studying for just a bit longer.  After all, is it really procrastination if it’s on behalf of school spirit?

It seems like buying things owned by former Harvard students is in vogue. Yet, unlike the domain name that preceded Facebook, the newest item on the auction block attracted a bit more notoriety than just the attention of the Administrative Board.
The plot of land in Lincoln,  Montana, that Theodore J. “Ted” Kaczynski ’62—more commonly known as the Unabomber—lived on during his nearly 20-year-long mail-bombing spree is now up for sale.  According to a Montana real estate website, you can “own a piece of infamous U.S. history” for $69,500—a substantial decline from the original price of $154,500.
A child prodigy, Kaczynski entered Harvard at the age of 16. Despite his success as a mathematician, he moved to the secluded location in 1971 and began plotting his attacks after becoming disillusioned with modern society and technology. From 1978 to 1995, he killed three people and injured 23 others. He was apprehended in 1996 and is currently serving a life sentence in federal prison.
The alias “Unabomber” developed after he targeted university scholars and an airline flight.
The property does not include the cabin which Kaczynski lived in while he resided on this land, since the cabin is currently on display at the Newseum in Washington,  D.C. Potential buyers should also be aware that the 1.4-acre plot lacks electricity and running water.

As the Cambridge weather nears freezing and our workloads call for all-nighters, one thing remains constant in the life of nearly every Harvard student’s diet: the burrito.  In this mini-series, we’ll be posting detailed reviews and rankings of grilled chicken burritos from four different establishments (Boloco, Chipotle, Qdoba, and Felipe’s), judging on criteria ranging from temperature to tortilla thickness. By the end, we hope to have made the lives of inebriated wanderers and starving studiers a little easier, while offering an easy tool for Reading Period procrastination—burrito rankings.
 
Burrito #3: Chipotle’s grilled chicken burrito
Includes: Chicken, cilantro-lime rice, black beans, tomato-onion salsa, cheese, and flour tortilla.
-50 points for an overpowering taste of onion.
Price: $6.25
Neutral: cheaper than some alternatives, but not cheap enough.
Weight: 1 lb, 2 oz. 
-200 points for being comparatively puny.
Tortilla: Thin, tasteless, and rather hard around the edges. Does not make for an enjoyable textural experience.
-200 points for crunch.
Rice: Flavorful and moist—the cilantro really has an impact—but not warm enough.
+500 points for flavored rice that actually tastes like its label.
Guacamole: $1.95
-100 points. Way too expensive!
Chicken: Juicy, spicy, and flavorful. Defines the burrito.
+1,000,000 points for getting chicken right.
Cheese: One giant clump…in a bad way.
+500 points for having a presence, -100 points for failing to melt.
Extras: Corn salsa and sour cream (good consistency).
+400 points for free sauces, -100 points for being boring.
Hours of operation: 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily
-200 points for the most limited hours.
Deals and steals: Occasional $2-per-burrito promotions and deals for Harvard students.
+300 points for showing Harvard some love, -100 points for eliminating an annual Halloween tradition (disappointing those who dressed up as burritos this year, expecting free food).
 
The bottom line: Chipotle’s grilled chicken burrito didn’t quite live up to Flyby’s high standards—the tortilla was a serious issue—but it had some high points. The chicken, a Chipotle specialty, was delicious, and the rice was unique as well. A little more melty and a little less costly, and this burrito could have risen to the top of the pack.
Total points: 1,000,950
Final Ranking: 2/4

If you were able to join the several hundred Harvard undergraduates at last Friday’s surprise "absurdity" protest in response to protestors from the Westboro Baptist Church, you’ll remember that students brought their creative A-game in the form of hilarious protest signs.  If you didn’t get a chance to go–don’t worry! Flyby has compiled a list of some of the best signs that we spotted that morning.
"Lesbians love my Hanukah bush"
"Anyone up for Scrabble later?"
"I was told that there would be free Qdoba"
"Team Edward"
"I have a sign"
"I have a sign too"
"Is this the line 4 Bieber tickets?"
"If God hates Jews, then why is Jon Stewart so awesome??!?!"
"Unimpressed cat is unmoved by your hate and she does not like douchey protestors"
"The rent is to 2 damn hi!"
"Save the unicorns"
"Dorothy left Kansas for a reason"
"Prom?"
"I think everyone involved here is cute"
"You’re a wizard Harry"
"God loves us all! Everyone! No exceptions! Even Yale!"
"God’s favorite food is kugel"
"The original Dominos was better"
"Where’s Waldo?!"
“This sing is misspelled”
“Hooray for our sign!”
“Fish are friends not food”
“Best soup on campus”
“Gingers have souls”

Do you yearn for those carefree days of being a freshman? Or maybe you’d like to eat in the most "Hogwarts-esque" dining hall on campus again.  Either way, Annenberg is open for upperclassmen in all houses for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day during reading period, excluding Saturdays and Sundays.  So if you're busy studying in Cabot Science Library, you don’t have to trek back to the river (or worse, the Quad) to get a meal. Since  the weather's getting colder and your time is probably getting tighter, we hope that you enjoy this added convenience.
