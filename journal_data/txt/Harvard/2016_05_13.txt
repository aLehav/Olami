After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The summer before my junior year, I was sexually assaulted in my own home.
The night that it happened, I was so drunk that I had passed out. When I woke up, he was on top of me; his fingers inside me. I was too drunk to move or speak. I don’t know how long it lasted. I don’t know how it started. When I woke up the next morning, I felt hungover and heavy, disgusting and disgusted. More than anything, I felt unsafe. My body was not my own—it felt foreign and contaminated. I no longer belonged only to myself. Someone had violated me and I had been wholly unable to stop him. This, I realized, was what real fear felt like. My body was not safe from violence, my space was not safe from invasion, I was not safe from assault. My sense of autonomy had evaporated. All that was left was the permanent etch of his touch on my skin.
In the past few months, there have been countless conversations and articles about “safe spaces.” In particular, this campus has seen the rise of a striking and ugly anti-safe-space argument: that safe spaces encourage “coddling,” that they restrict free speech, that they condone censorship and pandering. Those who need safe spaces are labeled as whiny, childish, and weak.
This argument enrages me. Those of us who seek out safe spaces do not do so because we need coddling, or because we are weak. We seek out safe spaces because we feel unsafe. Have those who criticize these spaces ever truly felt unsafe? Do they know what it means to feel unsafe at night? To feel unsafe in a classroom or in a bedroom or at a party? Do they know what it means to feel unsafe at Harvard?
After that night in August, I needed, more than anything, to feel safe. I no longer felt safe in my own home or my own bed; even my body had become an unsafe space—alien and dirty. For months, I tried to erase that night. I didn’t talk about it. I tried to smother it so thoroughly that it would disappear. In the early months of my fall semester, I didn’t consider myself a victim of sexual assault. I didn’t allow myself to admit it. Admitting it would make it real.
Instead, I buried it. I swallowed it whole and held it inside. It sat within me like a heavy and massive piece of darkness. I slept less, I ate less. I even became scared to talk—I feared that if I opened my mouth, I would cry, or the heaviness inside me would slip out. And then people would know. The longer I struggled to silence it, the heavier it got.
My assailant was one of my closest friends. For a while, after that night, I still spent time with him. His best friends were my best friends. If I wanted to see them, I had to see him too. With each day, it became more difficult to be around him. Whenever he and I were together, stuck in the same room, I could feel the force of it, of what had happened between us. I could feel that silent, suffocating pressure as we sat with our friends, pretending like nothing had happened. Maybe I was the only one pretending.
My friends didn’t know, and I was too scared to tell them. If I told them, our friend group would rupture. They’d have to choose between us. And if I told them, then they too would have to grapple with this darkness. They would have to bear the weight with me. I thought I had to bear it alone.
What had once been safe spaces—the spaces I’d built with my closest friends—had become inhospitable. They had become unsafe spaces—spaces in which I felt afraid and angry, in which I was constantly reminded of what happened that night. And when we danced and drank together as a group, I always worried, would it happen again?
I could no longer bear to be around him, so I cut him out of my life. And I began to tell people—first, my partner and then a few of my friends. Each time I told someone, I felt a little lighter. It was easier to share the weight with others than to bear it on my own. And I left those unsafe spaces behind. Those spaces were dark and stifling. I needed safe spaces.
In the past two years, I’ve found them. I’ve found new friends and new communities of activists. And I’ve created new spaces with my old friends—without him.
I applied to work at the Women’s Center and I became a peer educator for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention & Response. Both spaces taught me how to understand what had happened to me. They taught me that it was not my fault. It was assault. I did not consent. The people in these spaces have helped me heal—they have all told me, again and again, “I believe you. I hear you. I love you. I’m here for you.” These are spaces of utter compassion and empathy.
Last semester, I shared my story at a rally for survivors in the Yard. That week, I received dozens of notes from friends, peers, and strangers, with messages reading, “me too,” or, “something similar happened to me.” It was only then that I realized the scope of this problem at Harvard—sexual violence is ubiquitous on our campus. It was devastating to learn that so many friends had had similar experiences, but our sharing has allowed us to come together. As one friend wrote, “I feel lucky to be surrounded by people who understand. There is strength in numbers.”
These are my safe spaces, my places of sanctuary: the physical spaces of the Women’s Center and OSAPR, but also the community of survivors at Harvard and beyond. I feel safe in the spaces I’ve created with my friends: with the old friends who believe me and listen to me, with the new friends who validate me, and with the families I’ve found at Harvard—communities of people who are unafraid to love, who understand the radical power of kindness and empathy.
For people who have faced violence, oppression, or exclusion on this campus, safe spaces offer light and shelter. Perhaps more importantly, these spaces make us feel safe on a campus that can, at times, feel exceptionally unsafe.
Let’s stop talking about the final clubs. Let’s stop talking about spaces that exclude, about spaces that have failed to be accessible and inclusive. Instead, let’s talk about the spaces that include, about the spaces that are fully accessible to people of all identities. Instead of focusing on the spaces that fail, let’s devote ourselves to celebrating the spaces that succeed. Let’s work to embrace the spaces that welcome us—all of us—with compassion, love, and care.
For those of you who scoff at safe spaces, I urge you to think beyond your own experience. I urge you to imagine feeling unsafe on this campus. I urge you to think critically about how you can make this campus a safer space for all of us who share it.
As a survivor of sexual assault, I want spaces where my "no" is heard and respected. I want spaces where my body is free from violence, where my ability to consent is not taken from me. I should not have to ask for them. Safe spaces do not coddle me; they empower me. And sometimes, they make me feel invincible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard administration’s recent decision
to sanction
unrecognized single-gender social organizations—including
sororities and women’s final clubs—is not the result
of Harvard somehow not listening to women.
It is the result of the Harvard administration after decades—after
centuries—finally hearing feminist critique.
For generations, Harvard feminists and activists have advocated
for the sanctioning or disbanding of final clubs. Now that we have it, new
debates on gender and inclusiveness have come to the fore.
This debate recently took to the streets—or the Yard, where
around 200 students, mostly women, protested the recent decision under the
banner #hearherharvard. These women claim that
sororities and female final clubs are spaces of female empowerment, and that
pressuring them to go co-ed along with their male counterparts will exacerbate
the problems of sexism the administration is trying to combat.
To many of us who have long been part of the struggle against
clubs, these arguments are wrong-headed, to say the least, and at worst
blatantly reactionary. Let’s walk through a couple of them to
come to a deeper understanding of gender and of what it means to create
inclusive spaces. I’m confident that when we do, we’ll
find that this decision can only improve women’s and marginalized
people’s experiences on campus.
First: Nobody is against female spaces.
The argument that the Harvard administration is somehow targeting women’s
spaces is disingenuous. Far from the denial of female voices, these changes are
the result of decades of protest and troublemaking from women, from boycotts to ersatz invitations
to guerilla tactics—which
the admin has finally listened to. This decision is meant to seriously overhaul
a system that is not only deeply hostile to women and queer people, but
incredibly classist and exclusionary.
Sororities and female final clubs are far from the only spaces
on campus oriented toward female solidarity and community, and they are the
least accessible. Spaces like the International Women’s Rights
Collective, the Association of Black Harvard Women, Radcliffe Union of
Students, the Athena Program, the Women’s Center, and Latinas Unidas are fully
recognized by the College, do not demand dues, do not require an arduous punch
or rush process, do not depend on heteronormative correspondences with male
clubs, and are open to all.
Second: Female spaces are not inherently progressive.
We are not, as I said, against female spaces; we are against
female spaces that exclude. We are against female spaces that exclude trans
people, gender-non-binary people, and cisgender men whose identification with femininity
may encourage them to seek out a progressive female space. We are against
female spaces that perpetuate elite class norms, that have an inherently
heterosexist structure, and that rely on exclusionary membership policies—all
of which Harvard’s female and male clubs and Greek
organizations display.
Both final clubs and Greek organizations depend in structure on
competitive admissions processes which evaluate students on arbitrary social
criteria. In the Harvard context, these often rely on elite social norms favoring
those with access to gender, sexual, racial, and class capital. Even with
financial aid, the requirements that students pay dues, have clothes for
events, and comport themselves according to club specifications often spell
class discrimination.
These groups further depend on a binary and presumedly
heterosexual gender structure—including events like date nights and
mixers with male clubs—which severely limit space for
gender-non-binary and trans students and put queer students in a bind.
Just because we are women does not mean we can’t
be classist, homophobic, transphobic, racist, and exclusionary.
Third: Just because a space includes marginalized people does
not mean that it is progressive.
Arguments against Greek organizations and final clubs often
erase those marginalized members who have found friends and homes within the system.
As women who experience multiple forms of marginalization—queer
women, trans women, women of color, women from low-income backgrounds, women
with disabilities—we make complex negotiations within
complex systems to seek spaces of support.
However, we should understand Harvard’s Greek and final
club systems as marginalizing at a structural, rather than always at an
individual, level.
We’re dealing, here, with two inherently
different visions of what it means for a space to be socially just. In one
definition, offered by a number of club members, the inclusion of members from
marginalized backgrounds proves that a system is progressive.
In the definition offered by critics of the system, however, we
can understand the very structures of Harvard’s
fraternities/sororities and final clubs—the reliance on often elite networks; social
norms which draw on heterosexist and classed histories; binary men’s/women’s
spaces— as inherently exclusionary.
We have a chance now to address the structural injustice of
these systems. We ought to take it.
Fourth: If your group is actually progressive, it will come out
of this all the better.
If you truly believe that your sorority or female final club
stands for the empowerment of gender-marginalized people, this decision is only
good news.
What, actually, is the threat of a gender-neutral membership
policy to a progressive women’s organization? Recognized feminist
and women’s cultural organizations on campus are open to students
regardless of identity. These spaces have not somehow been flooded with
anti-feminist cisgender men intent on ruining our female solidarity. This
probably won’t happen to your club or sorority if you adopt a
gender-neutral policy, because anti-feminist cis men hate progressive women’s
spaces more than anything. Just look at the tantrums of the male final clubs.
If you insist that your club identity inherently depends on an
exclusionary membership policy, then your club is nonsense and is rightly targeted
by the new sanctions.
But if you’re willing to accept this as an opportunity
to become a more just organization, we can look forward to a number of exciting
changes. Your club will come to a deeper understanding of gender, sexuality,
and inclusion; will be more open to students across the broad spectrum of
gender; and will revolve less around events like date nights and mixers with
male clubs and fraternities.
The transition won’t be easy, and it won’t
be comfortable. Sororities may have to disaffiliate from national-level groups,
and final clubs will be forced to overhaul the exclusionary reality of the
punch process. The College, on its end, will need to drastically increase
support and funding for those student organizations that provide direly needed
space for marginalized people, such as cultural groups, women’s
groups, and queer groups.
The rest of us won’t be off the hook. We must all confront
the contradiction inherent in discussing inclusiveness at one of the world’s
most powerful and elitist institutions. We must consider how we can take the
power we have as Harvard students and alums to enact change not only on campus
but in the world.
It is not going to be easy. Progress never is. It is worth it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the brouhaha that has erupted following the administration’s decision to sanction single-gender organizations, there has been an explosion of viewpoints ranging from full support to fierce opposition. In my view, none of the opposing opinions have been as pointed, or at least as widespread on my Facebook newsfeed, as those coming from members of female final clubs and sororities, who have harshly criticized the administration for excluding them from discussions and for abruptly shutting down their “safe spaces.” Even the leaders of male final clubs—places that some might argue are some of Harvard’s least safe spaces for women, depending on one’s interpretation of the recent sexual assault survey—feel that women have gotten the short end of the stick.
I can understand how important these spaces are to women who are lucky enough to have access to them. But even though these groups’ very existence tries to limit our thinking to just “female” or “male,” what happens when we stop thinking about this issue in terms of the gender binary, as the new rules would like us to? What happens when we turn and look at all of the queer and gender nonconforming people who have felt marginalized by these groups during their time here? Harvard’s queer community is already hopelessly fragmented as it is—why is it that we can’t get a piece of the pie, too, and benefit from some of the funding and the physical spaces that these groups have enjoyed for so long?
Here’s my perspective, as a proud, feminine gay man. Many of Harvard’s single-gender groups loudly profess their willingness to accept queer members, and I’m happy to have seen that many do. To me, though, it doesn’t matter how accepting male final clubs or fraternities are of the (in many cases, masculine-presenting, or at least just well-connected and/or wealthy) gay men who make it through the punch or rush processes. Prior to coming to Harvard, I had always had a tight network of almost exclusively female friends, but when sophomore year rolled around, I discovered that many of the female friends I had just begun to make had suddenly been yanked off into exclusively female organizations—groups that I was categorically barred from joining solely on account of my gender.
Of course, I could have done the male equivalent and tried to join a gender-exclusive group for men, but why on earth would I have wanted to join a fraternity or a male final club, where I would have stuck out like a sore thumb with my limp wrists, gay-sounding voice, and too-tight jeans? The one punch event I did go to my sophomore year was one of the most uncomfortable experiences that I’ve had during in my four years at this school. I felt as though I’d been whisked back into my Texas hometown and shoved back into the closet, acutely aware of how much I would have stuck out had I chosen to be myself.
After a rough first two years here at Harvard, I eventually came to the unfortunate realizations that I was far too feminine for male final clubs or frats, that my male gender prevented me from joining the female final clubs or sororities where I would have felt more at home, and that there was no unified queer community to turn to for support either. I eventually did find my niche, but I still can’t help but wonder what my experience here would have been like had I been a member of the class of 2021 instead of 2016.
To the sorority sisters and final club women of the #HearHerHarvard campaign, I see where your anger is coming from, and I have heard you. But as you continue to process your feelings about the administration’s decision regarding single-sex organizations, I implore you to think of all your queer and gender-nonconforming peers.  How “safe” are your organizations for those of us who don’t fit as neatly into the categories of “male” and “female” as you and your male counterparts do? Would your groups, as they currently exist, accept a transgender woman who does not “pass” for female? Maybe your relatively progressive chapters here at Harvard might, but what about chapters in other, more conservative parts of the country? And how could your organizations deal with a potential member who identified as gender fluid, as a number of our peers here at Harvard do?
Finally, from a feminine gay man to all of my friends in female final clubs and sororities, aren't we fighting many of the same battles against the patriarchy, anyway? Why does it have to be the case that we instinctively laugh upon seeing a picture of boys twisting their arms in classic DG fashion—why can’t boys do something girls do without it being seen as a joke? Why can’t a female final club or sorority one day become a safe, inclusive space for people of all genders who express feminine gender characteristics? (Note: this would not by any means eliminate the possibility for these groups to hold women-only events!)
While I know this sort of “let’s erase the gender binary!” thinking might come across as a pipe dream to some, I think that it’s at least worth considering as we grapple with the impacts of these new rules. In making this decision, the administration has certainly stepped on a number of toes, but from a broader perspective—or at least from my perspective as a member of the queer community—I think it’s a step in the right direction.Carl Rogers '16, a linguistics concentrator, lives in Dunster House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My freshman year, I cried on the walk home from the activities fair. There were so many organizations on campus, each with a complicated-sounding process for joining and all of which seemed to demand talents and skills that I wasn’t sure I had. I’d come to the activities fair looking for a community where I could find the lifelong friends I was supposed to be making in college, and left feeling more alone and inadequate than ever.
Sorority recruitment that February was a turning point for me. Here was a group of women offering the community I’d been seeking. I was amazed by the time that my new sisters devoted to actually being there for each other in a way that I hadn’t yet experienced at Harvard. I felt welcomed, heard, supported, understood, and authentically known. Judging from the outpouring of support for sororities from women on Facebook after the College announced it would sanction sororities, I am not alone in feeling this way.
To clarify a few misconceptions about sororities on Harvard’s campus: the recruitment process is open to any woman on campus who chooses to go through the process, and women must rush all four sororities. Recruitment is a mutual-selection process, meaning that the preferences of the potential new members are weighed as equally as the preferences of members. There are no date events included in the process, and each event is intentionally structured to allow each woman to meet just as many members as everyone else participating. Women who go through recruitment overwhelmingly receive a bid to one of the four sororities (notably, at a significantly higher rate than is reported by The Crimson, as that number includes the nearly 60 women who elected to drop out of the process this year.)
That said, no woman in a sorority could claim that our organizations are perfect, or that we somehow speak for all women of Harvard College. Just because recruitment is formally open does not by any means invalidate the feelings of discomfort and isolation experienced by those who don’t feel they fit the stereotypical sorority “mold,” nor does it lessen our very real burden to continually make ourselves more inclusive, accessible, and diverse. This is a dialogue being had throughout the sorority community: Since before the College’s policy announcement, efforts have been underway to guarantee that any woman who goes through formal recruitment in 2017 will be guaranteed a bid from one of the sororities. As it stands now, approximately 600 women on campus, or 20 percent of the women at Harvard College, are active members of sororities and there is infinite potential for expansion to meet demand.
Sorority women at Harvard represent a wide range of socioeconomic, geographic, ideological, academic, and racial backgrounds. Many members take a campus job, work in a lab, or as PAFs to offset their dues, and a limited amount of financial aid is available. Unfortunately, without the financial support from the College that many on-campus organizations receive, it is not economically viable to reduce these dues by much. It is also our responsibility to acknowledge the impossible financial burden these dues create for many women who opt not to go through recruitment. In not recognizing sororities, Harvard College has actively contributed to the monetary cost of being in a sorority, which is undeniably prohibitive to some women on campus. Many of the expenses associated with sorority membership could be reduced dramatically if Harvard allowed us certain privileges afforded to recognized organizations, like the ability to use campus space for hosting meetings and formals.
This is not to say that sororities are perfect institutions (we aren’t), but that we are an example of what a single-gender organization working towards inclusivity on this campus might look like. Yes, we must work to be less cost-prohibitive. Yes, we must work to make recruitment feel more welcoming and inclusive, and to fight the stereotype of privilege that accompanies “Greek life” across the country. Yes, we have areas to improve upon. And yes, we must be willing to have these conversations. Fortunately, if you listen closely, these discussions really are happening within women’s organizations across campus.
The administration, in handing down a blanket decision that failed to account for the critical differences between the missions, values, and recruitment processes of sororities and final clubs, missed an opportunity to work with sororities to make this campus and our social organizations a more welcoming place for all. There are so many things that sororities do on campus that the institutions recognized by Harvard do not. Sororities offer friendship that is not contingent upon success in an extracurricular activity, provide a purely social space that is accessible to students, and create support groups for women in a large-scale way that is otherwise lacking on campus. Given the current scope of communities on campus, these are not things we can afford to lose.
Harvard is a hard place. It can be a lonely place. It is a place where true community is hard to come by, and where all too often community is a talking point rather than a way of life. Sorority women should not have to choose between the community that we have worked hard to create and leadership positions on campus.
My contention is not that sororities are perfect organizations. We certainly have room for improvement and are willing to actively work to foster a more inclusive, affordable, and open community at Harvard. The sanctions, as currently imposed, offer us no room to do these things. Because of our national affiliations, we are unable to go co-ed without losing access to female alumnae networks and resources from our national organizations.
We can and will work with the administration to tackle issues of exclusivity, but it remains to be seen whether they’ll actually work with us or will continue to stifle opportunities for many of the fortunate women who have managed to build communities with other women at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council recently considered legislation to investigate the comp processes students must complete to join recognized student organizations. Some members of the UC expressed unease with the inequitable, stressful, and exclusionary nature of comp processes. In order to address these concerns, the UC discussed potentially collecting information from students and organizations to better understand membership requirements, along with creating a student evaluation system for comps.
While this is a good idea in principle, the UC is not the best organization to lead this effort, because we are skeptical that it would be able to successfully investigate comp processes. Such an endeavor would require significant time and resources, and the UC is already committed to other projects like expanding social spaces on campus. Given other concerns, such as with the way it disburses funds to student groups, the UC should focus on improving the projects it has already undertaken.
Despite these practical limitations that the UC faces, it is still commendable that it is drawing attention to an important issue that ought to be addressed. In light of recent discussion of exclusivity as manifested in unrecognized single-gender social organizations, it is also important for us to consider the forms of exclusivity that manifest themselves even in the student organizations that are recognized by the College.
For example, many comp processes are long and time-consuming, preventing students who have to work a job on campus from participating. Providing this information to potential compers up front allows them to make a more informed decision when they choose which organizations to join. Many comp processes are also difficult and require some level of prior knowledge or experience, disadvantaging students who never had those opportunities in the past. At a minimum, a centralized resource describing the variety of comps across campus would provide students with more information about these organizations. At its best, it would encourage groups to become more inclusive.
An initiative to compile information about comp processes would be particularly important for students who come to Harvard without any prior knowledge of its student organizations. For those students in particular, a comprehensive and honest guide to the comp processes of each student organization would be invaluable. Exclusivity on this campus is real and harmful, especially to students who come from low-income or first-generation backgrounds. We should do everything we can to lower the barriers that they may face, and make Harvard a more inclusive place.

As the academic year draws to a close, the number of mumps cases on Harvard’s campus continues to rise, with 58 confirmed cases as of Wednesday.
Students experiencing the mumps may not be able to participate in end-of-year Commencement activities, and those with symptoms of the disease have been encouraged by the Harvard Summer School Study Abroad Office to refrain from traveling.
Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira, who provided the updated number, has previously expressed concern over the spread of the disease and asked students to take precautionary measures. He said students infected with the virus would not be able to participate in end-of-year activities.
“[G]iven the two- to three-week incubation period for the mumps virus, students who come down with the virus at this point may have to miss certain end-of-year and/or summer activities if they are ill,” Barreira wrote in an email statement.
An email sent out last week from the Summer School Study Abroad Office informed students of the mumps outbreak on campus, and encouraged students to refrain from travelling if they experienced any mumps symptoms.
In the email, students were advised to call Harvard Travel Assist if they experienced any symptoms of mumps while abroad, and were told that case managers “will advise you on your situation and work with us to connect you with appropriate resources.”
According to Stephanie T. Kacoyanis, a spokesperson for the Harvard Division of Continuing Education, the Summer School has met with Harvard University Health Services and Global Support Services to discuss issues surrounding the potential spread of the virus abroad.
Though students traveling abroad have to undergo a “health clearance” process, which includes necessary inoculations required for the country of destination, no additional screening for mumps is in place, Kacoyanis wrote in an email. She added that the Summer School Study Abroad Office would not change any policies due to mumps.
“As of now, no changes to any programs are planned, but we will continue to monitor the situation,” Kacoyanis wrote.
Mumps is transmitted through salivary exchange, or respiratory droplets, fairly large particles that come out of people’s mouths and noses.
Those infected with mumps have been placed under quarantine for five days—Harvard College students experiencing symptoms have been housed at the Harvard Inn. The outbreak, which Barreira first confirmed in early March, has affected various groups on campus and spread throughout the Boston area.

Harvard could expand its undergraduate enrollment and construct new Houses in Allston in the future, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview Thursday.
Smith said administrators have been thinking about how to prepare for such a move, which would require scaling up relevant student services and increasing the size of the faculty to preserve Harvard’s student-faculty ratio. Currently, about 6,700 undergraduates are enrolled at the College.
In recent years, several of Harvard’s peer institutions—including Princeton, Yale, and Stanford—have committed to increasing the size of their undergraduate populations by constructing additional undergraduate housing. Princeton hopes to increase enrollment by about 125 students per class, Yale by about 200 students per class, and Stanford by 100.
“We certainly do think about [expanding]—not just because our peers are doing it, honestly, but because we do have lots of talented students that can come and be part of our Harvard community,” Smith said. “Allston is obviously a potential place to put another House—or two.”
Smith emphasized, however, that his focus is still on the current undergraduate population and that any such expansion would come as a “next step” after the renewal of the river Houses—which are currently a priority in Harvard’s historic $6.5 billion capital campaign. Last semester, Dunster House opened  its doors after a 15-month long construction process, the first fully renovated House under the project. Administrators plan to renovate Winthrop House next academic year, followed by Lowell House starting in the summer of 2017.
Smith said a formal timeline for the potential expansion of the student body has yet to be established.
This is not the first time that administrators have considered growing the size of the undergraduate population. In 2003, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers discussed the possibility of constructing new undergraduate housing in Allston in order to grow the size of Harvard’s undergraduate body. One proposal floated then would have replaced the three Houses in the Radcliffe Quad—Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer—with three Houses in Allston.
In 2020, Harvard plans to relocate two-thirds of the faculty of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to a new Allston campus, which will feature a $1 billion science and engineering complex approved last month.
This year, Harvard accepted a record-low 5.2 percent of undergraduate applicants to the Class of 2020, following a general trend of declining admissions rates at the College. Over the past several years, Harvard has accepted a relatively constant number of undergraduate applicants each admissions cycle, while the number of applicants has steadily risen—from about 34,000 applicants five years ago to over 39,000 this year. Eighty percent of students accepted to the Class of 2020 plan to matriculate in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though members of Harvard University's smallest and largest employee unions have decided to merge, they may face legal barriers due to the job classifications of their members.
Mitchelle A. Forrester, Harvard University Security and Museum Parking Guards Union president, said better benefits and a stronger bargaining unit are what influenced the decision to try to merge with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
“The contract that we have right now is a bit on the weak side,” Forrester said. “From HUSMPGU, we stand to gain a  union that’s really strong and that can support us in the way that we need to be supported.”
The decision comes ahead of a June 30 expiration date for HUSMPGU’s contract with the University. HUSMPGU represents approximately 80 workers, compared to the 4,963 employees who are members of HUCTW.
According to Forrester, over 90 percent of HUSMPGU members are in favor of the merger, and indicated their support by signing a card that the unions presented to the University. But despite the groundswell of support among members, the road to merging is not a simple one.
“We’re seeing signs of a little hesitancy, or nervousness from the University about this idea that has developed in the last couple of weeks,” said Bill Jaeger, executive director of HUCTW. “We’re concerned about that, but also hopeful that we’ll be able to talk through the concerns.”
Typically, unions looking to merge have to submit a proposal through the National Labor Relations Board—the federal agency that handles labor disputes. Looking to reduce the amount of time the  approval for the merger would take, HUCTW leadership instead submitted a proposal to Harvard earlier this spring, asking the Labor Relations and Human Resources department to allow them to hold an independent election through a local arbitration agency.
However, in a letter to Jaeger and Forrester last week, Director of Labor Relations Paul Curran noted a distinction in job classifications that precludes members of HUSMPGU from being represented by a non-guard union.
HUSMPGU members are classified as “guards” within their contracts. According to a section of the National Labor Relations Act, unions with guards may only be represented by unions that exclusively  have guard membership—a requirement that HUCTW does not meet.
Though still in talks with union leaders, the University has suggested that the two unions forward their inquiry directly to the NRLB. However, doing so may leave the  merger request unresolved until after the expiration date of HUSMPGU’s contract. In the interim, both University and union leaders have indicated a willingness to begin bargaining.
“We really want to go to HUCTW, that’s kind of our goal, but at the same time I don’t want to leave any of my members lacking in benefits,” Forrester said. “Therefore, I really want to make sure that they’re well taken care of, like they’re supposed to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is unlikely to be confused with the powerhouse revenue generating state schools who routinely fill 100,000-seat football stadiums and make headlines for their latest TV deals.
However, behind the scenes, Harvard’s athletic department is working to push its ticketing operations into the digital age and has quietly instigated a steady rise in attendance over the past five years, bucking trends that have set in at other schools.
The recent success of Harvard’s football and basketball teams has increased excitement around athletics, and the athletic ticketing office has worked to capitalize on the momentum. The ticketing office is staffed by five full-time employees who oversee everything from season ticket holder outreach to game-day sales. Increasingly over the past few years, technical projects and active outreach to potential customers have taken on a larger portion of the department’s resources.
“The whole ‘getting to work in the morning and mailing tickets for two hours and answering the phone all day’ routine has evolved into so much more,” Nicholas Majocha, Director of the ticketing office and Assistant Director of Athletics, said. “We’re managing a web page, working with our marketing team, working with our outbound sales team.”
These priority shifts have, thus far seen success. Since 2012, average home attendance across Harvard’s six ticketed sports—men’s and women’s basketball and hockey, football and men’s lacrosse—has increased by 10.6 percent according to Majocha. Over the same period, free undergraduate ticket distribution has more than doubled.
FILLING SEATS
Increasing athletic attendance can't be taken for granted; the Super Bowl-winning and locally beloved New England Patriots saw a roughly 16,000 person drop in attendance over the past year. Despite a competitive local market—there are dozens of colleges in the Boston area—Harvard’s ticketing operation has continued to innovate and reach new fans as it proactively seeks new customers.
Harvard athletics has seen a 10 percent increase in average attendance over the past five years, driven by strong performances in a few of the sports to which the ticketing office has devoted significant sales resources.
The men’s basketball team has been a huge draw, and along with a pair of NCAA tournament appearances, attendance for games has increased by 30.4 percent since the 2011-2012 season, from 1,415 to 1,845 fans per game. This represents the largest increase for any ticketed sport, Majocha said.
Men’s football has also been a major driver of ticket sales for the department, with a more than 11.1 percent in ticket sales. The football team’s annual night game, which drew only 888 undergraduate fans in 2011, drew over 2,000 last fall. In total, over this period average game attendance grew from 11,520 to 12,799. Majocha added that last season’s Dartmouth and Princeton games were the highest-grossing non-Yale football games in program history.
Men’s hockey attendance has grown 12.7 percent since 2011, and women’s hockey has seen modest increases as well, even setting a new program attendance record when more than 2,100 fans attended this season’s Harvard-Yale game.
While women’s basketball attendance has not grown at the same rate as that of the men’s team, the women’s team boasts the second highest average attendance for its games in the Ivy League, Majocha said.
As ticket sales have increased, the revenue they provide the athletic department has grown accordingly, although Majocha declined to provide a number, citing a departmental policy on disclosing budgetary information.
Only a few teams generate significant revenues for the department, but these revenues are then disbursed to a wider array of Harvard teams, according to Majocha. “We have six ticketed sports that generate revenue, and three of those ticketed sports generate a significant portion of that revenue,” Majocha said. “But that money helps support a broad range of programming in all 42 sports.”
Majocha added that the revenue these teams generate also helps the department cover other less obvious expenses that would be more difficult to afford without these revenues.
“Any revenue we generate goes into a pool,” Majocha said. “Some of it goes toward field maintenance, and some of it may go toward electric bills, and some of it goes toward operational costs for our teams.”
Majocha explained that increased revenues were also important because of naturally increasing departmental expenses. Additionally, he said ticket revenue accounts for only a small percentage of the overall budget.
Despite these revenue increases, Majocha explained that ticket revenues do not comprise a substantially larger portion of departmental revenues than they have in the past.
“Our ticketing revenue has seen steady growth,” Majocha said. “But I wouldn’t say it’s suddenly becoming a larger portion of the pie.”
Timothy J. Williamson, associate director of athletics, added that the athletic budget is subject to fluctuations in many variables, and that although ticketing revenue is important, many other department sources of revenue like concession sales contribute significantly to the department’s budget.
FROM PAPER TO EMAIL
The uptick in ticket sales comes as the entire ticketing operation embraces technological change after years of customer feedback, along with innovations in sales strategy that have led to a more proactive approach.
The transition away from paper tickets towards online ticketing came first. Then came the implementation of a web design overhaul, interactive surveys, and an updated ticket-purchasing platform. The slate of changes have been in keeping with the department’s pivot to digital technology.
“Over the past few years, their roles here have changed,” Majocha said of his staff. “It’s more about refining the customer purchasing process than it is picking up the phone and having someone mail in a check.”
More 80 percent of tickets are now issued online through email, limiting the number of hard tickets mailed and stocked at will call. Majocha said electronic tickets have delivered the dual-benefit of reducing costs and easing the purchasing process for customers.
This past year marked the first the office implemented gameday ticket scanning to facilitate the increased number of customers with electronic tickets.
The introduction of email tickets and scanning represents a significant infrastructural investment, according to Majocha. “It’s not as simple as snap your fingers and all of a sudden you can do email tickets,” said Majocha. “You have to have a capable ticket system, you have to buy the scanning equipment, and there is infrastructure to go through.”
The convenience of online ticketing is as notable to Majocha’s staff as much as by their customers. “In years past we’ve had two or three boxes of will call tickets on game days, but now people walk right past us,” ticket operations associate Greg Collins said. “We don’t have to rush through those will call orders now and have more time to focus on bigger-picture projects.”
One such project is the ticketing office website redesign. In response to customer feedback that the check-out process for online sales was “cumbersome,” Ticket operations associate Matthew Crawford helped lead an effort to retool the platform. Now, for instance, fans can choose individual seats at football games rather than general admission. Such features of the website redesign have also subsequently reduced game day staffing costs.
“These aren’t revolutionary things,” said Majocha. “These teams aren’t sinking millions of dollars into our ticketing software because it doesn’t generate that kind of income. So we’re trying to figure out what works for our customers and what works with our model.”
ASPIRING FOR SALES
Staff have also used the time afforded by streamlined ticketing sales to more directly target customer groups. Their primary target is also the most obvious; Harvard undergraduates, who have traditionally been reluctant to pick up tickets directly from the Murr Center ticket office located across the river.
“I could see it being a deterrent for people who don’t go to games frequently to have to go all the way to the Murr Center to pick up tickets for games,” frequent football and basketball attendee Matthew Goodman ’18 said.
Over the past few years, department staff have distributed student tickets directly in House dining halls and in the Annenberg freshman dining hall to make it more convenient for students to pick up tickets.
The office has bolstered its presence in the broader sales realm as well. “We have two people now that are spending all day target marketing, calling people on the phone and being proactive with sales rather than just being reactive and waiting for people to call us,”Majocha said.
The two person sales team proactively looks for groups and organizations to reach out to in an attempt to bring in new customers, Majocha said.
According to Majocha, who started with a full-time staff of 3, the two new staff members marked a significant leap. “We didn’t have the staff size to really do the proactive outbound outreach, which you see a lot from the bigger professional organizations or larger athletic departments.”
The sales team was brought over from sports business company the Aspire Group, according to Director of Harvard’s outbound sales operation and current Aspire employee John Rivers. Majocha said Aspire’s direct marketing expertise has helped Harvard modernize its ticket operations.
Rivers said he already counts many direct marketing initiatives under his watch such as email tracking, Qualtrics survey technology, and individualized outreach.
He also said the sales team has changed the product it is pitching; last year it began to combine group ticket packages with “on field experientials”, such as halftime scrimmages and post-game photos on the field. It also began to offer partial ticket plans to targeted segments of the Harvard athletics customer base.
“We look at individual customers from our database,” Rivers said. “Maybe you’re a Princeton graduate living in the area and are interested in a plan that has all the Princeton basketball and hockey games. Or maybe you’re on a timeframe where you just want to attend one game a month, so we try to hand pick games on the schedule and cater it as best we can to our fan base.”
Last year, the outbound sales team sold 80 such partial season tickets for just basketball and hockey. The addition of these plans, according to Rivers, accounted for a 15 percent increase in hockey revenue.
KEEPING CUSTOMERS SATISFIED
Technology or not, the athletic ticketing industry is still client-facing and driven by customer service.  Well aware of this reality, Majocha and his office have worked to make sure the game experience keeps customers coming back.
The office provides various benefits for its most loyal season ticketholders. At the home finale for the men’s basketball this past March, a row of specially designated chairs could be seen dotting the perimeter of the court. Above them, in the Lavietes Pavilion lounge, a halftime reception was set up for the VIP ticket holders.
Enhanced gameday features for season ticketholders are part of a deliberate strategy to cultivate a specific customer base.
Along with various special amenities available at basketball games, the athletic department also sells all-inclusive food packages for the Bright-Landry Hockey Center’s Boynton lounge—the “VIP spot” for season ticket holders, according to Majorcha—and on-field seating for the annual Harvard-Yale football game.
“The VIP experience is something we’re looking at to reward our most loyal ticketholders and also to create new revenue streams,”Majocha added. “What the revenue does is go back to support all of the programs.”
Gordon Leslie "Skip" Freeman Jr. ’70, a former hockey player and longtime season ticket holder, praised the ticket packages as a good deal for customers.
“They always have a buffet there, by the time you [purchase the package] it’s not a huge extra expense. It’s a closer, more social environment than it used to be.”
On top of gameday VIP services, there are priority purchase periods for tickets to special events such the annual Boston hockey-tournament Beanpot. Locals without direct ties to Harvard are also turning into customers for the athletic office.
Basketball courtside season ticket holder Robert Crawford, who has no direct ties to Harvard, said the athletic department has turned VIP packages into “an awesome experience.”
“I take my kids to coaches clinics, practices, and now the VIP lounge is open for non-Ivy games too,” Crawfod said. He added that he views his subscription—four courtside season tickets for $900 each—“as good, or even better entertainment than the pros.”
Despite the revenue-generating goals of such initiatives, broader customer service remains at the heart of the ticketing office.
“Our focus is on customer service and on attendance growth,” Majocha said. “While we try to maximize revenue, finances don’t drive our decision making.”
Freeman added: “It’s more a concierge service right now than it is just ticketing.  They really do the job and take care of what they see as clients and not just customers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard cruises past its $6.5 billion capital campaign goal, Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators have rethought how they pitch House renewal, one of the campaign's top priorities, to donors and alumni.
In an interview Thursday, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said administrators are now linking fundraising more closely to potential donors’ undergraduate House affiliations. While he said these donations ultimately will contribute to the umbrella “House renewal” project, launched to renovate Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses, FAS may honor donors with named spaces in the House of their choice.
“The money still comes honestly as supportive of the entire program—that’s how we spend the money,” Smith said. “But the recognition gets tied to particular spaces in the Houses that you care about.”
Echoing Smith, Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for Alumni Affairs and Development said donors can express their interest in naming a space within a particular House. She added, however, that their financial contributions may not be used in reconstructing that House.
“[House renewal is] a project that requires a great deal of funding in order to get all of the Houses done, so that I think normally it’s not so closely tied, and I think the donors understand that,” she said.
FAS aims to raise $400 million for House renewal during Harvard's record-breaking $6.5 billion capital campaign, which has exceed its goal. In comparison to other FAS priorities, such as fundraising for faculty research and for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, House renewal has not seen such momentum in previous years.
Smith said that he had not expected the fundraising process to be easy. He added that administrators at Princeton and Yale—institutions that have raised money for similar large-scale projects—told him that it would be difficult to gather funds to revamp already standing buildings.
“I personally think we’ve been doing very well in fundraising for House renewal,” Smith said. “Yeah, we didn’t raise a single $400 million gift like we did for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, but it’s a different project.”
The first fully-renovated building, Dunster House, opened last fall. Construction will begin on Winthrop House this summer and Lowell House is slated for renewal the following year. In total, the House renewal project could cost as much as $1.3 billion.
Administrators have already used the revamped Dunster House to host events for potential donors and to show alumni the House’s new facilities, a concrete example of the vision for a project that administrators have said would otherwise be difficult to articulate.
In the interview, Smith also said Harvard administrators have considered constructing undergraduate Houses in Allston following the renewal of Houses on the river.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Public Health will undergo a significant transition next fall as it welcomes the first group of students admitted to a new Ph.D. program and replaces its five Doctor of Science programs.
After partnering with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the five programs at the School of Public Health—Epidemiology, Environmental Health, Global Health and Population, Nutrition, and Social and Behavioral Sciences—will be replaced by a singular Ph.D. in Population Health Sciences. Students will still be associated with the fields of study within the revamped curriculum of the unified Ph.D.
Students already enrolled in Doctor of Science programs will not be grandfathered into the new program and will be the last students to receive the research doctorate in its 144-year history at the University. Both the S.D. and Ph.D. degrees were introduced in 1872, the year Harvard created what was then called the Graduate Department.
Aside from curricular differences, S.D. students and Ph.D. students do not share the same benefits. While students at HSPH do not have guaranteed tuition funding, students under the umbrella of GSAS enjoy that benefit among others. Teaching assistantships at HSPH also generally pay substantially less than a teaching fellow position for GSAS students.
S.D. student Justin M. Feldman said tensions regarding student benefit packages will be “exacerbated” next year, and could potentially create animosity, when Ph.D. students join the same programs as existing S.D. students.
In an effort to achieve equity between the two groups of students, HSPH will offer guaranteed tuition funding beginning next year for all current S.D. students, according to the director of the new Ph.D. program, School of Public Health professor S. V. Subramanian. In past years, S.D. students received full funding for their first two years and then had to find their own assistance or pay out of pocket.
“As far as we know this is unprecedented in the history of the S.D. degree,” Subramanian wrote in an email. He added that HSPH will also cover the facilities fees for all students next year.
This change comes after years of frustration about unequal funding for S.D. students compared to those in other degree programs. Last year, in light of a historic $350 million donation to HSPH, Feldman said students wrote a letter to the dean asking for more financial support.
Subramanian said HSPH has worked over the past few years to narrow the gap between the benefits enjoyed by students pursuing the two different research doctorates.
“We have come very far in the last five years to narrow this gap,” Subramanian said. “We have moved from a situation where many students—especially those who were not on training grants—self-paid almost all of their tuition, to the upcoming academic year in which no student will pay any tuition.”
Members of Harvard’s graduate student unionization effort have also spread the message about the inequities in benefits at the School of Public Health.
I-Min Lee, a professor of medicine who received an S.D. from the School of Public Health and helped review this year’s first batch of applications to the new Ph.D. program, wrote in an email that the funding available for students makes it “extremely attractive.” She added that the more interdisciplinary curriculum will benefit students by providing training in different fields.
“This new Ph.D. program we have would certainly have given me a head start, formally, had it been available when I was a student,” Lee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights found Harvard Law School in violation of anti-sex discrimination law Title IX in late 2014, it suggested a number of revisions to the Law School and University’s process for investigating sexual assault.
Among those recommendations, the federal agency—abbreviated to OCR—identified one particular area for improvement: Harvard needed to specify a clear timeline for sexual assault and harassment investigations as well as disciplinary proceedings afterwards.
“OCR’s expectation is that the 60-day timeframe for investigations should include the process of imposing sanctions against perpetrators and providing remedies for the complainant and school community,” the resolution letter to the Law School reads.
The 60-day time frame has been the federal standard in Title IX investigations in recent years. In its 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter, OCR wrote that a typical investigation takes 60 days. Later, OCR’s 2014 “Frequently Asked Questions” document clarified that some investigations may take longer depending on a case’s complexity.
But Harvard’s centralized office for investigating cases of sexual assault and harassment, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, regularly takes more time than OCR expects—sometimes double or close to  triple the recommended 60 days—to complete its investigations. For cases involving students, investigations often last more than four months from the opening of an investigation to final disciplinary rulings and sanctions—well beyond the 60-day window that the federal agency recommends for the entire process.
Investigations into cases involving a student complainant in the 2014-2015 academic year took, on average, more than five months to complete, according to Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s Title IX Officer. Thus far in the 2015-2016 school year, ODR investigations have, on average, lasted for almost four months, Karvonides said. Of the 40 cases ODR has heard since it opened in September 2014, 22 have involved student complainants, according to Karvonides.
Under the University’s central Title IX procedures, investigation findings are handed off to school disciplinary bodies after a ruling. Karvonides’s statistics do not include the time it takes for a school’s disciplinary body to determine appropriate sanctions.
The average time frame for ODR investigations also calls into question the office’s adherence to its own predictions. Harvard’s University-wide procedures for sexual harassment complaints involving students state that investigations will finish “ordinarily within six weeks of receipt of the complaint.” 
In practice, though, Karvonides said meeting that timeline often proves more complicated. Between the desire for a thorough investigation and the more quotidian realities of interviewing busy college students, Karvonides said it is often unrealistic to expect a 60-day timeline.
“When you think about the sexual assault cases in particular, I ask anyone to please point me to what other forum has been able to do a thorough and a fair—one having parity, having sensitivity—investigation of sexual assault and do it in in anything close to a 60-day time frame,” Karvonides said.
Karvonides said she hopes that ODR will be able to complete its investigations more quickly in the future and pointed to the progress the office has already made.
"Every day, I’m looking at ways at how we can move these along more quickly. The challenge is moving it along more quickly but maintaining that same quality and the sensitivity,” she said.
In one case, the investigation began in mid-December, 2014 and was not completed until late May 2015, according to case documents obtained by The Crimson. Broken up by two school vacations, the investigation still lasted several months beyond the timelines both the federal government and the University recommend. Ultimately resulting in a finding of violation against the respondent of Harvard’s sexual harassment and assault policy, the case illustrates how sexual assault investigations at Harvard pan out.
"There’s a balance of being sensitive and thorough and trying to be as timely as possible in completing this process," Karvonides said of ODR investigations generally.
When Karvonides received the initial complaint in mid-December, she assigned a Boston-area attorney that Harvard contracted, to review the case, according to the case documents.
After the attorney had read the complaint and interviewed the complainant about a week and a half after the complaint was filed,the attorney decided to begin an investigation, setting into motion a process that would last for the next several months. In early January, the attorney notified the respondent of the complaint and the investigation; five days later the respondent submitted a response.
From there, the investigation moved along predictably. After interviewing the complainant again and then interviewing the respondent in late January, the investigator talked to a number of witnesses in February and March of 2015.  The attorney interviewed both the complainant and respondent again in mid-March, and then interviewed the respondent another time about a week and a half later.
But it was not until seven weeks later in early May—five months after the complainant initially filed a complaint—that the investigator sent both the complainant and respondent a draft of the final report in the case. About a week later, each party submitted a response to the draft report. And, finally, in late May 2015, ODR made its ultimate ruling: the respondent had violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and assault policy.
“The Investigator finds, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that Respondent engaged in unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature toward Complainant,” the report reads.
In 2014, OCR launched an investigation into the College’s compliance with Title IX. As part of that investigation, OCR attorneys visited campus last spring. The investigation is ongoing. A lawsuit filed by a recent graduate claiming the College mishandled her sexual harassment case also remains ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe Varsity Heavyweight rowing team has a strong tradition of success both on and off the water. Throughout the program’s 46-year history, many current and former rowers sporting the Black and White have won titles at the national and international levels.  While these performances stand as a testament to the focused efforts of the individual Radcliffe athletes, the team also has a rich history of coaching expertise. With the longest time at the helm, Liz O’Leary has set her standards high for the team since the day she assumed the role of head coach in 1986.
“I really believe that a coach sets the culture for a team.  We all view ourselves as strong, powerful Radcliffe women, and Liz is really the essence of that,” senior captain Freddie Archibald said.  “She expects total commitment and the absolute best out of us every day, and come graduation, we all hope to leave armed with the confidence to accomplish whatever goals we might encounter moving forward. That’s largely thanks to the tone Liz sets for us everyday on our team.”
Prior to coaching at Harvard, O’Leary built up a successful rowing résumé.  Her experiences in these formative years truly galvanized her passion for the sport.  She attended the University of New Hampshire, graduating in the class of 1976. During her days as a competitive rower, she represented the United States in a total of six World Championships. The summer after graduating college, O’Leary also earned a spot on the U.S. national team competing in the 1976 Olympic games held in Montreal, the first ever iteration to integrate women’s rowing.  At this Olympics, she placed seventh in the Coxed Quadruple Sculls event.
She would have represented the States again in the 1980 Moscow Olympics had the U.S. not boycotted the games in response to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. Nevertheless, after finishing up her remarkable rowing career, O’Leary ultimately decided to shift her focus to full-time coaching in 1984.
O’Leary began her journey into the coaching realm at her alma mater UNH. Subsequently, she assumed the role of head girls’ coach at Brooks School, a private boarding school in North Andover, Massachusetts. Quickly learning the tools of the trade, she demonstrated her ability to properly motivate and teach rowers the physical and technical necessities of the sport.
After three years with the Radcliffe Heavyweights, former head coach Lisa Hansen Stone stepped down after the 1986 sprint season.  Having accrued a total of 18 regular season wins and ceding only three losses, Stone left big shoes for her successor to fill. In her first season coaching RVH, O’Leary demonstrated that she was certainly up for the task.  In the 1987 season, the Black and White went undefeated in all of its dual races, placed 1st at the Eastern Sprints regatta, and took home a bronze medal at the National Championships race.
Many of the Radcliffe athletes attribute the team’s success to the atmosphere that O’Leary cultivates, one that is geared toward optimal performance in all aspects of life.
“Liz pushes us to do our very best within the boathouse and also she serves as a figure of support in our lives in general,” added Archibald.  “She has attended countless thesis presentations and a cappella concerts and really takes a vested interest in our lives outside of rowing.”
In a sport where so many variables must be perfectly aligned to field the fastest crews, Liz O’Leary’s impressive record throughout the years serves as an indicator of her keen ability to train her athletes, some of whom have no prior rowing experience.
“I started rowing here at Radcliffe, so I feel like Liz has really brought me into the sport and I am so grateful and happy to have found her as a coach and a mentor,” senior Radcliffe rower Mary Carmack said.  “I’ve always been super impressed with the way Liz is able to see and expect more from her athletes than we might even see in ourselves.”
Carmack serves as a perfect example of O’Leary’s ability to rapidly bring her athletes up to speed. Despite having walked-on her freshman year, Carmack managed to excel under O’Leary’s tutelage and has managed to work her way up through the varsity boats despite stiff intra-team competition. She has even gone on to compete in the double sculls event at the Under-23 World Championships in 2015, an exponential leap that could only be possible with the best of coaching.
Now, entering her 30th season, O’Leary has helped the squad earn a combined 197-103 dual season record against other fiercely competitive Division I teams. She has also coached the team to four Eastern Sprints titles—in 1987, 1989, 2003, and 2015—the last of which, the Black and White swept the entire event and won by open water in the premier Varsity Eight event.
As of four years ago, the Ivy League Championships, an Ancient Eight-specific event that has gradually stemmed from the Eastern Sprints, has emerged as another platform allowing Radcliffe to contend with some of the nation’s very best. Radcliffe has consistently medaled and even won the entire event in the first iteration of the regatta in 2012.
Beyond the EAWRC and Ivy League, O’Leary has also helped Radcliffe leave a sizeable footprint at the national level. O’Leary has fostered many successful performances at the NCAA Championships, to which she has led the team to 17 appearances in the event’s 19-year history.  In 2003, coming off a nearly undefeated dual season record and an Eastern Sprints victory, Radcliffe took the gold at the NCAA Championships.  It was after this phenomenal season that Liz O’Leary was awarded the Collegiate Rowers Coaching Association’s Division I Coach of the Year award.
“I’m always amazed how even though she’s been coaching for 30 years, Liz is always willing to try new things to make us faster,” Carmack said.  “She’s very innovative and willing to adapt, whether that’s trying out new [rowing] machines or training plans, which really enables us to keep working toward our goals in an effective way.”
Nowadays, Liz O’Leary can often be heard early mornings and late afternoons on the Charles River coaching alongside her crews from a launch.  Managing a team of over 50 rowers and coxswains is no easy task, but Liz O’Leary has proved that she is firmly intent on bringing all her boats up to speed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women’s water polo is on the rise—at Harvard, on the east coast, in the U.S. and in the world. This year, the Harvard women’s water polo team finished with a 24-10 record, recorded nine wins against top-25 teams, and from March 23rd through April 6th, was ranked No. 13 according to CWPA rankings, its highest ranking ever.
Introduced in 1900, men’s water polo was the first modern Olympic team sport. However, it took 100 years for women’s water polo to reach that same status. Women’s water polo was first introduced at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.
Unlike lacrosse where men and women play with different rules and contact is limited and penalized for women, men and women abide by all the same rules in water polo. Furthermore, because of the full body suits, women are able to play a more physical variation of the game.
“The women have the full suit so there’s much more to grab and hold onto,” the Friends of Harvard Water Polo Head Coach, Ted Minnis, explained.
Although many water polo players enter the sport with a swimming background, water polo is very much a physical, contact sport.
“I feel like water polo is a mix of basketball, handball, and swimming,”freshman attacker Kristen Hong said. “The fluidity of the game is very similar to that of basketball.”
The increase in women’s water polo can be largely attributed to Title IX.
“Title IX has done a very good job of growing the sport of water polo in the U.S. and as a women’s team we’ve medaled in every Olympics,” Minnis said. “In 2012 we won the gold medal, and we’re favored to win it again this year.”
Despite its success over the last two decades on the international scale, U.S. women’s water polo has traditionally been isolated to just California.
Since the NCAA women’s water polo championship was founded in 2001, only Stanford, USC and UCLA have brought home victories. No non-California school has ever participated in the Championship game or won the consolation game.
However, at the age group level, water-polo is expanding rapidly, and at the collegiate level, players are looking at strong programs, such as Harvard, that are located all around the country.
“At the age-group level you’re starting to see pockets growing outside California,” Minnis said. “Florida has a good pocket, Connecticut, Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan. It’s great to see.”
In the past six years, Harvard has transformed both its men’s and women’s water polo programs with both teams finishing the year having achieved top-13 rankings this season and completing back-to-back 20-win seasons.
A key to the Crimson’s success has been recruiting top-talent and having athletes who are motivated to work hard and lead.
“We’ve done a good job of changing what the perception out in the water polo world is about Harvard,” Minnis said. “Six years ago, I think most kids thought Princeton or Brown were the options to play in the Ivy League and not come to Harvard, and and we’ve changed that perception.”
Two of the graduating seniors were named All-Americans, proof of the hard work they’ve put in over the past four years and the talent they brought to the program.
“I think that getting the talent here was the first step of really changing what’s going on out there,” Minnis said. “Then, our culture is that these kids come in and they train really hard and do a good job in the classroom, too.”
The spread of women’s water polo throughout the U.S. has impacted the recruiting process for high school student-athletes, too.
“Many kids are finding now that if they’re not going to be a professional water polo player and make a living off it, education is very important,” Minnis said. “I think you see a lot of kids now who are willing to leave California and not go to the typical big four schools.”
Hong, who hails from Orinda, Calif., is one such athlete. Recently named the team Rookie of the Year after having been the CWPA Division I/II Rookie of the Week five times this season, Hong posted a record breaking season, matching the single-season goal record with 80 scores and 21 multi-goal efforts and posted a team-best 45 steals.
“I really wanted to come to a school where I could be a student-athlete and where academics had a high priority placed upon them,” Hong said. “Harvard athletics are so unique in the fact that classes come first but we can still be part of a very competitive D1 program.”
Next season, the Crimson will be welcoming two more southern California standouts as well as adding some geographic diversity to its roster with players from Florida and Quebec.
A highlight for the team this season was training and competing in Italy over J-term.
“In Eastern Europe—Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Hungry—it’s like their national sport. It’s like watching basketball,” Minnis said. “So we went to Italy with our women in January and the European Championships were going on and it was on television every night. So we’d sit it on our hotel rooms and be able to watch games and it’s a pretty big deal over there so it was really cool to see that.”
“Not only did the trip allow us to start training a bit earlier than we normally would and exposed us to different types of playing styles that we were forced to adapt to and could use to improve ourselves, but most importantly the trip was filled with so many memories that helped us bond, which makes us a well functioning unit in the water,” Hong added.
Looking ahead to next season, the Harvard women’s water polo team is looking to welcome four new athletes and furthering its success.
“Our goals for next year are to build off the success we had this year and hopefully win a championship,” Minnis said. “We want to continue to be leaders in the pool, in the classroom and in the community.”
