To the Classes of 2020 and 2021:
When the pandemic was in its early months, we wrote an open letter to the class of 2020 in which we celebrated your resilience, sadly acknowledged the fact that you would not experience the traditional in-person Commencement rituals you had long anticipated, and put the best face we could on the Zoom and YouTube alternatives we were preparing for you.
In that letter, we also all found comfort in what we called the “firm promise” of the University to have you return.  The gathering “will be all the sweeter, all the more meaningful,” we promised then, “for having been deferred.”
At that time, in our naiveté, none of us expected that not only the class of 2020, but also the class to follow — the class of 2021— would end up having its senior year Commencement experience deferred.  And yet, that is what happened. Classes of 2020 and 2021, you together share the distinction of having attended — and graduated from — Harvard College during a historic pandemic.
In the coming decades, when you meet for reunions on campus, you all will be the focus of panels and roundtables. Student journalists of the future will seek you out for interviews. They will want to know: What was it like?
And you will have such varied stories. Some of your stories may be hard to hear: they will describe experiences of anxiety, illness, grief, and missed opportunities. Some may also carry a tinge of anger, as you describe to these future generations all the things that you think Harvard should have done differently.
Other stories will be more philosophical. They will be about the ways in which, even as your on-campus Harvard experience was cut short, your lives expanded in other areas: you deepened relationships with family, you took on responsibility for maintaining a household for the first time, you rethought your priorities and life paths, you discovered new parts of the country and even the world.
Still, other stories some of you will tell, especially members of the Class of 2021, will have future generations rapt while you describe what it was like — as vaccines were rolled out but the pandemic persisted — to be invited back to a much-altered campus for your final Spring semester: the peculiarity of attending online classes from your bedrooms, the grab-and-go dining, the thrice-weekly testing, the universal mask-wearing, the experience of a House social life that had now largely pivoted from Zoom to the (often chilly) outdoors.
In the final weeks of that semester, the Houses invested a lot of effort into figuring out ways to give you all a send-off to remember. On Commencement Day itself, we recognized, toasted, and celebrated you online. But we knew, Class of 2021, that none of it could quite compensate for the disappointment you felt, given the reality that you – like the class before you – would not experience an in-person Commencement.
But now both of you are returning! It is finally your moment for gowns, mortarboards, speeches, bagpipers, marching bands, swing bands, last-chance dances, and champagne toasts. Harvard — and all of us — are all dressed up and waiting for you. Welcome back, Classes of 2020 and 2021! The time for our long-awaited reunion is finally here.
Anne Harrington is the Chair of the Faculty Deans of Harvard College and the Faculty Dean of Pforzheimer House.
This letter was written, reviewed, and submitted by the Faculty Deans of all twelve Houses and the Resident Dean of the Dudley Community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations, Class of 2022! You’ve survived, endured, and thrived through some of the most difficult years in recent memory. As you emerge from these tough times and start a new chapter in your lives, it’s important to sit at this moment and celebrate everything you have overcome and achieved to get here. This is your moment to cherish.
It also serves as a moment of reflection. The next phase of your life will likely be very different from what’s come before. I offer you three stories and lessons from my own life that will hopefully serve you wherever your path might lead.
1. Ground yourself in gratitude and service.
Born deep in Pakistani mango country, I was destined for a very different life until my mom won the lottery. The visa lottery, that is — a wild chance that landed my family and me in the United States. Growing up here was hard. We struggled with housing insecurity and survived only thanks to food stamps. Through that time, I became deeply committed to ensuring that my family escaped poverty and that others did not have to endure the same experience we did.
This self-imposed pressure was a heavy weight to carry, but by grounding myself, I found resilience through the tough times. I was, and still am, so thankful just to be here. I know I have pure luck to thank for the opportunities I have today and I am grateful for being welcomed with open arms into the Cambridge community.
As graduates of a prestigious university, you have so many opportunities, and thus so many difficult decisions to make. How do you balance career growth, financial success, and meaningful work? How do you live up to the prestige and measure your life’s success?
The anxiety of these decisions can be paralyzing. Don’t paralyze yourself. Ground yourself in gratitude and service.
2. You will fail often. Fail upwards.
I lost every single election I was ever in — from middle school student body representative to my first City Council race. I always tried my hardest, pushed the boundaries, and ultimately ended up as a strong second place. That is until I won my first election. Now, all everyone remembers is “Youngest Cambridge City Councilor Ever Elected.”
We only see the highlight reels of those we admire, but behind every successful individual is a string of failures, from bad auditions and rejected papers to bankrupt startups and lost elections. The mistake is thinking that failure is the end of the road or the wrong direction. Hardship is part of the journey. You will fail before you succeed. Embrace it. Learn from it. Use it as a stepping stone.
3. Happiness is not a checklist.
A good friend of mine recently took her own life. She was so young and had achieved every metric of success: she had professional accolades, financial stability, supportive parents, and a loving partner. She was the last person I was worried about. But sadly, happiness cannot be passively collected; it must be actively grown.
As smart, ambitious graduates with big dreams, you’ve put a lot of time and effort into honing your craft and creating the conditions for success in your career. Have you set yourself up for fulfillment and inner peace in the same way?
You have finished your time at Harvard, and for many of you, this will be your last time in a structured academic setting. Friends won’t come by automatically and there will always be important work that needs to get done. Don’t get lost in reaching your own internal goals.
The destination is important; find a way to also enjoy your journey.
The guardrails are off and life is now a marathon. These are the three lessons I leave you with: find your grounding, fail upwards, and enjoy the journey.
Burhan Azeem is a member of the Cambridge City Council.

To the Classes of 2020 and 2021:
Every Commencement is special, but yours is unique. The pandemic has delayed it for a year or two. In that same span of time, the country also faced a reckoning with racial justice in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.
The ramifications of that murder are still with us. George Floyd’s death forced the country to stop looking away from its legacy of racism. It is fitting, therefore, that Harvard has just issued a 132-page report detailing the University’s involvement with slavery and other forms of racial discrimination during its almost 400-year-long history. The report makes for difficult but necessary reading, as it shows that Harvard was deeply complicit in one of the worst human rights abuses in history.
We cannot undo the past, but we can confront it. And that’s what we have begun to do as a community. I hope that this, too, makes you proud. The University whose name shines brightly on your diploma and in the world has taken an important step to seek a fuller understanding of its history.
As Harvard undergraduates, you have another reason to be proud: It was undergraduates who played an important role in making us reckon with our past. Almost 15 years ago, four students at Harvard College sat in Robinson Hall to begin a seminar on Harvard and Slavery. Little did they or their instructor know it would end with the University committing $100 million to begin to rectify its historical involvement with slavery.
On that September day in 2007, we had no idea what we would find. Inspired by a courageous report issued by then Brown University President Ruth Simmons on Brown and slavery, these four students began excavating a history that had been hidden in plain sight for more than 150 years. They, and dozens of other students who took the seminar in subsequent years, discovered  a university deeply entangled with slavery for the first 200-plus years of its existence. They wrote about Harvard presidents and faculty enslaving people and documented how profits from the slave economy funded Harvard’s early expansion; they discovered how Harvard suppressed debate about slavery and revealed how Harvard scientists perpetuated racist ideas. In 2011, with President Drew Faust’s support, their findings were published in a widely distributed report; they also they created a website and offered a walking tour that traced slavery on Harvard’s campus.
When the University’s first responses to these findings were underwhelming, the students demanded that the University meaningfully engage with its history and find ways to redress these past injustices. In 2016, President Drew Faust unveiled a plaque on Wadsworth house that commemorated some of the enslaved people who had been forced to labor there for Harvard presidents. That same year, the seal of the Law School — which until then had been inspired by the family seal of the school’s early donors, who were slave plantation owners — was abandoned. And in 2019, President Lawrence Bacow tasked a committee to write the report and issue the recommendations that came out last month.
The students’ research laid the groundwork that made all this possible. Along the way, they taught us lessons that I hope will guide you as you leave campus and go out into the world.
For one, they intuitively understood that the privileges afforded by Harvard’s unmatched resources and stellar reputation come with a responsibility to scrutinize its history, including the unsavory parts. And once they knew what was there, they made it public, suggesting that the University follow  the sage advice of an 18th-century rabbi that “the secret of redemption is remembrance.” They reminded us that we can only build a better future if we are willing to confront our past.
Second, the students focused on a local issue to confront a national, even global problem. The afterlives of slavery still stamp our politics, our patterns of inequality, and our institutions. With big issues, it can be hard to know where to start and what to do; the students remind us that we can always focus on the place, community, or institution that we find ourselves in. As the famous phrase puts it, we can think globally, and act locally.
Third, the students acted. They knew something had to be done. They followed the advice of the Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci who, while imprisoned by Mussolini, counseled that what we need is the “pessimism of the intellect, and the optimism of the will” — that is, to know the worst aspects of reality and nevertheless to act in a way that can change that reality.
I hope that, after you graduate today, you will remember the lessons of this experience. Do something with the enormous privilege that is a Harvard education. Try to make the world a better place. Like the brave young woman who stood her ground and filmed George Floyd's murder, speak up.  Be persistent and patient — you may fail the first time and succeed the next. Be stubborn. And get into trouble — the kind of “good trouble” former Congressman John Lewis spoke about. Wherever your path takes you, remember that you can help repair our damaged world anywhere you find yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations, Classes of 2020, 2021, and 2022! When you started your undergraduate journey you imagined your commencement celebration differently. In the early days of the pandemic, no one could have pictured how the world would change — yet you persisted through its exigent demands and earned your degree with much instruction being remote. Now, as you return to campus for an in-person ceremony, the full magnitude of your accomplishment may not be apparent — a formality in honor of an achievement in the distant past. I hope you appreciate the significance of this occasion. You persevered through challenges and trauma no students have faced before — and earned a degree. You are impressive, and you should celebrate!
As I reflect on my message to you I wonder: will you remember what I write? I fervently hope so, since my message is to implore you to ask our alma mater to do more to address the climate crisis. (Confession: for my own graduation, I barely remember the speech by a hero of government integrity, and know my relatives were more excited by celebrity sightings of my classmates’ families). Please take in my message, from an alum who got a taste of activism on campus where my own views were challenged, my critical thinking skills developed, and my commitment to social justice solidified. I ended up an elected official in Cambridge, a city I first visited moving into my first-year dorm, a city now the focus of my public service and activism.
Harvard has produced many remarkable graduates — thinkers, doers, poets, artists, and every type of world player — and its leadership in college affordability is just one example of forward thinking and positive changes. Other areas are works in progress. Harvard plays an important role in the city — in hundreds of ways college students help our young students and hundreds of ways the University interacts with and improves our city’s operations. As a School Committee member for more than a decade and now as City Councilor, I know how much Harvard contributes.
Recently I’ve focused on our collective work on the climate crisis. I am grateful for the University’s leadership in this area; Harvard has committed to fossil fuel neutrality by 2026 and becoming fossil fuel-zero by 2050. Cambridge itself has officially committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 and the Council has pledged to 2035. Although I am thankful for the substantial work that Harvard and the city have done to address the climate crisis, it is not enough.
The climate crisis is central to our survival and to all work on equity, since vulnerable populations are already and will continue to be most affected by the calamitous impacts of a chaotic, warmed world. Catastrophic wildfires burning today, heat waves smothering entire cities, houses washed into the sea daily, and an uptick in diseases run rampant in every corner of the globe. As an alum and a City Councilor, I consider it crucial to hold our institutions accountable for actions that will have decades-long consequences. Cambridge declared a climate emergency over a decade ago and has failed to meet almost every goal that’s been set, especially in terms of greenhouse gas pollution reduction. And Harvard, for all its scientific advances and worthy contributions to the world, contributes a notable portion of the city’s overall emissions. Specifically in Cambridge, buildings are responsible for 80 percent of citywide emissions, and Harvard buildings account for a significant amount (MIT down the road accounts for about as much as Harvard — pass it on to your MIT friends). It will be challenging to re-configure building operations to decarbonize. It will cost money and be disruptive, but those are not valid reasons to delay. As is often said, if Harvard with all its resources can’t do it, what hope is there for others? An emissions-free Harvard by 2035 is possible, if we commit the necessary financial and intellectual resources towards that goal.
You are in a position to make change. As evidenced by the victory won by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard last year, sustained public pressure from students and community members works. It can be grueling and demanding, but ultimately activism, especially from people in positions of privilege, can be an effective part of advocacy. We, as Harvard graduates, have a rare type of privilege that we must challenge ourselves to wield. Join me in asking and inspiring Harvard to not only work to contain the emissions pollution elsewhere, but also here, in its own home, and end all emissions from every Harvard building before it is too late. And don’t stop there — take this message of urgency and action wherever you go. Also, wherever you land, vote with the climate in mind.

March 10, 2020: a day that has gone down in Harvard history — and quite a few staff editorials. In the wake of the rising Covid-19 risk, students cleared out the pastry case at Lamont Café and booked red-eyed flights home. Friends clutched each others’ arms and attempted to jam months of standing dates into the few remaining days. Seniors turned in midterms and said goodbye to campus for the last time — until now.
March 10 came like an eviction notice. But it was not just from Harvard’s physical campus in Cambridge that we were ousted. As we returned to the faraway corners of the globe where we once eagerly welcomed our Harvard acceptance letters, the metaphorical Harvard bubble — that mini-universe of campus culture, politics, and jargon, self-sustaining and self-centered — burst. Without a shared space and friendly run-ins to tether us, our connections to Harvard frayed. We began to look outward not from the perspective atop Harvard’s ivory tower, but from our new surroundings in the larger world outside of our cherished University. No longer was Harvard our first and only frame of reference.
We still carry the marks of our semesters apart. In our first full post-Covid year of 2022, we have struggled to tailor a pre-Covid Harvard experience to our pandemic-altered bodies and minds. Even upperclassmen who should know this place inside and out bring a freshness back to campus, a burst of mint air that escaped when the bubble popped.
A year later, we thought the Harvard bubble would be back: pristine, impenetrable, entirely isolating. Yet this year more than ever before, we have been made to reckon with events and questions that are far greater than Harvard itself. The bubble, once compromised, cannot be un-burst. Layer by layer, we have strived to reach beyond its confines, to grapple with the issues that surround our treasured Cambridge campus.
That work starts with Cambridge itself, a city rich with community and character but sometimes conspicuously absent from our collective imagination. Far too many of us have become “four-year tourists”: residents of Cambridge on paper, of Harvard in practice. Stuck behind our private police department and gated yard, we rarely venture out beyond Harvard Square or productively engage with our surroundings.
It’s safe to say that Harvard’s ever-expanding presence encourages such isolation from the rest of Cambridge — this academic year alone, the University temporarily closed its gates to non-affiliates. Thus, the age-old question of “town-gown” relations, the perennial struggle to balance local needs and ambitious higher education projects. Earlier this year, Harvard presented its 25th Town-Gown annual report to Cambridge city officials. The report praises Harvard’s “nearly 400-year partnership” with Cambridge, and highlights our “responsibility to create a campus that continuously strives toward a better future for our local community, as well as our global community.” We continue to question the nature of this partnership.
Recent interactions between Harvard and Cambridge, and now Allston, have left us feeling bittersweet. We do not dispute Harvard’s presence can be (and frequently is) a force of good. In Allston alone, the highly praised Harvard Ed Portal provides educational opportunities for local residents. As we have previously pointed out, the Ed Portal is a great example of the kind of work Harvard can and should be doing for the communities it expands into, and of the ways in which our local and educational footprints can be synthesized for the greater good. Still, tradeoffs are never clear-cut, even when it comes to praiseworthy projects. As valuable as Harvard’s learning opportunities for local residents are, they do not negate or perhaps even fully mitigate the broader harms of gentrification brought forth by our expansion into Allston. Going forward, Harvard should work harder to center the discussion around Allston residents and their needs, as they hold the biggest stakes in this process.
As students, however, we should also be mindful of our surroundings and the issues they mask. Not every crisis, even at the local level, is Harvard-centric. We cannot let the bubble’s glassy surface hide what lies beyond.
Take Harvard Square: The picture-perfect center of our small college community, complete with overpriced stores, massive tourist groups, iconic buildings — and an egregiously vulnerable homeless population. Over the past years, the graduating classes have doubtlessly grown used to the blatant inequity that haunts the square, desensitized to Cambridge’s most vulnerable inhabitants one encounter at a time. Continuity begets complacency, but shouldn’t. Our city is at its best when it moves forcefully against the tide — supporting ambitious initiatives like universal preschool education or reimagining its approach to public safety. Our graduates are, too.
But what comes after we graduate? Generations of Harvard students have come and gone; generations of Cantabrigians have remained. The issues they face do not leave Cambridge with each graduating class, they won’t be gone when the last commencement decorations are tossed aside. Instead, they remain here and fester — unless someone, sometime actively prevents them from doing so.
Our influence — much like the corollary sense of duty — doesn’t stop at Cambridge’s doors. As an uncontestable leader among American universities, Harvard frequently sets the agenda for our peers across higher education institutions, either by wrongfully monopolizing the debate or by contending with issues with broad implications for all. We believe Harvard’s prestige gives us the power to shape policy beyond our university; we have ample evidence that when Harvard dares lead, others follow.
The question, then, is what to do with our outsized power — where do we want to be followed? The destination is unclear, the path rocky. American universities are battling on several fronts, harried institutions wrestling with polarized perceptions of their social value and internal pressure to hold their sometimes titanic endowments accountable. Some, like Harvard, have embraced an expansive understanding of their moral obligations, drawing bright red lines surrounding their investments to greater or lesser success. Yet the boundaries of divestment are nothing if not unclear, and dedicated affiliates (including this Board) are bound to keep contesting and stretching them.
At the same time, falling admissions rates and limited housing capacity will, in the next few years, force national universities to either (rightfully and carefully) expand and risk upsetting local neighbors, or become entirely inaccessible. The very process by which so-called American elite institutions select the student body will soon be under scrutiny if not outright duress by an ideological Court eager to overturn affirmative action. And the untamable, frequently overstated discourse surrounding free speech is bound to continue — even if we remain steadfast in our view that taking a tad of public pride in one’s opinions, controversial or not, is the only healthy way to contest the cultural terrain.
These raging debates frequently bleed into broader political fights, all the way to Washington D.C., where Harvard is both an excuse and an elite boogeyman; so too does the power of the Harvard name. We expect some, if not all, of our peers to go on to hold exceedingly powerful, coveted posts: Congressional seats, prestigious judicial positions, and even Cabinet-level appointments. Many in the graduating classes have already begun their uphill climb to the highest levels of the American polity, one well-connected internship at a time. We are confident that Harvard will, once again, find itself overrepresented among the very powerful.
What our peers do with their prominence — whether they become Jacksons or Kissingers, an embodiment of our ideals or everything we shouldn’t be — only time will tell. As a board, we only hope they come to share some of our views on anything from the death penalty to the power of organized labor and implement them in our national backyard.
Not that the world surrounding our bubble ends at Boston-Logan. At times, Harvard’s influence extends even further, well beyond Cambridge, past Boston, Washington D.C., and America altogether. Harvard is nothing if not a global brand, one at times powerful enough to help decide elections — just ask Bulgaria. Our affiliates draw praise and ire from abroad; the publications they pen and projects they support are used to litigate decades-old wedges.
Even the words this very Board votes on can reverberate internationally, make national headlines at times — a compelling reminder of our responsibility to balance boldness with nuance, truth-telling with care and measure, righteousness with humility.
But where should we — this Board, this school — stand internationally, beyond providing a helpful nudge at the ballot box or fodder for foreign debates? How can we begin to understand, let alone exert a positive influence on, conflicts and crises so far from ourselves?
The answers to that and all questions beyond our bubble are complex and thorny; our expertise suffers when we seek to address matters larger in scope and more distant in character. The issues they raise are arguably better suited to councils and governments of highly-qualified people with numerous degrees, rather than bedraggled and bleary-eyed Harvard undergraduates struggling through their first.
As Harvard undergraduates, we are — by and large — not tasked with solving the climate crisis, delivering oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court, or facilitating diplomatic negotiation in eastern Europe. As a group, our student body holds far more potential than actual power and insight; we are budding young adults, with a wealth of opportunities before us, attempting to find our footing. But it is our responsibility as citizens of Harvard, our local Cambridge and Allston communities, colleges across America, the nation, and the globe, to grapple consciously and thoughtfully with the issues at the center of such pertinent tasks — our duty to consolidate evidence and form well-reasoned opinions from the results. To approach justice in accordance with our beliefs in any way we can, no matter how small we may seem in the greater machinations of the world.
Due in part to our historic Harvard bubble, we often only enact this responsibility within the innermost layer of ourselves as Harvard students. We engage in heated debate over the constitutionality of fictional laws in section, provide feedback to Harvard University Dining Services to expand dining hall hours, and scan wordy emails from the administration for the big takeaways on Covid-19 policy. When it comes to anything beyond our bubbled area of expertise, though, we frequently shy away from the issue, assuming it is out of our hands.
But what is our Harvard education for if it can only be applied within the restrictive bounds of Harvard itself? In reality, we only need to direct this same thought and passion from our Harvard student issues toward parallel global ones: the overturning of Roe v. Wade, local food scarcity in Cambridge, and disinformation in political campaigns, to start. We have all the building blocks in place to tackle the challenging questions. We just need to make a conscious effort to start considering them.
This is what we, the Editorial Board, have been doing all throughout the year, and since shortly after The Crimson’s conception in 1873. We have uncovered the facts. We have debated and opined on them. We have organized our arguments and sent them out into the world under The Crimson Editorial byline, urging actionable change within Harvard’s student body, the administration, and the broader culture of our campus.
We are not perfect reckoners, nor are we always right. We’ve defended some positions that people disagree fiercely with, and some that we ourselves no longer agree with. We disagree internally, among ourselves, in ways that are sometimes published and sometimes not. We likely pay too much attention to certain topics and not enough to others, and we sometimes hesitate to publish what we say at all.
If nothing else, we take pride in the fact that we have used our voices. We have grappled with the issues instead of ignoring them. We have carefully formed opinions and stood by them. We have put ourselves out there with our thoughts and welcomed the resulting discourse.
We urge graduating students to do the same as they leave the shadows of the Harvard bubble, never to return as undergraduates. Remain alert, alive, awake; protest what you oppose and champion what you cherish. Speak up, write at length, and confront difficult questions head-on. Let every blunder be a path to a more thorough understanding of reality.
March on, Harvard graduates — the world beyond the bubble awaits.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear graduates,
Well, it was not what you imagined. If while here you managed to contract a social disease despite appropriate precautions, Covid-19 was not the disease you had in mind. What’s more, if you were somehow involved in a breakthrough, it was not supposed to be a breakthrough infection. And if you dreamed of mastering an art, it was not the art of twirling a wand up your nose.
But congratulations all the same! The band is now playing, the crowds have arrived, the platitudes have begun. Hearts are bursting with pride. There is no parking anywhere. If anyone has earned a cap and gown, it is you, and I hope someone has thought to supply crimson masks emblazoned with, if not a Harvard H, then one more Harvard A, why not, in case for all the grade inflation, your GPA could still use inflating. For then it’s out, out with you into the cold, hard world.
If you have somehow missed the message that you will now need passion, empathy, and grit, you will now need passion, empathy, and grit. For the world is not only cold and hard but a mess. I’ll leave it to the speakers to go into the details. Let me just say that the world needs you! A lot! Please do not sleep more than is absolutely necessary.
Some other advice: Be kind, be kind, be kind. You need not be a doormat. But make people ask what we put in the water here, that Harvard grads are so kind. (Please do not also make them ask what we smoke.) Pick the objects of your affection with care, but then love steadily and unstintingly. Wear your heart on your sleeve and wear sunblock, too.
And, read books! The greatest technology ever invented is not the internet. It is the book. Out in the cold, hard, messy world, you will not need more information. You will be drowning in information. You will need perspective. Vision. Clarity. Wisdom. And, above all, candor — the kind of candor that comes when people are not writing for clicks.
For example,
“They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
They may not mean to, but they do.”
And:
“How dreary—to be— Somebody!
How public—like a Frog”
And:
“…for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.”
Ha. Just what you wanted to hear on graduation day.
Poets like Philip Larkin and Emily Dickinson and Matthew Arnold are not the only ones who tell it like it is. All real writers do. That is why we see books banned, not just long ago in autocratic nations, but right now, today, in America. But poets help make my case with brevity — and, by the way, are not only bad news bears. They provide inspiration as well. Seamus Heaney observes, for example, with some help from Sophocles:
“History says, don’t hope
On this side of the grave,
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up,
And hope and history rhyme.”
Yes. Hope and history can rhyme.
As JFK said, “Art establishes the basic human truths that must serve as the touchstones of our
judgment.”
Now BS springs eternal, and if you are anything like your forebears, one or two of you may have gotten the hang of piling it higher and deeper. More power to you! It’s a life skill. But without candor, we lose our way. So should you one day find yourself a card-carrying pooh-bah — as some of you just may — and even if you don’t, remember: shoot no messengers, and buy no lines, not even your own. Keep your fingers on your touchstones. Read, read, read. Let the books speak to you. Let them find you. Amanda Gorman was not speaking only of her own book when she wrote:
“This book is a message in a bottle.
This book is a letter.
This book does not let up.
This book is awake.
This book is a wake.”
Read, people, read!
And with that I salute you, classes of ’20 and ’21! Congratulations! Enjoy! Respect your elders! Seize the day! Take back the night! Go into the office! Vote! And one more thing, if I may be so candid: save the Harvard-Yale jokes for your 50th reunion. You can absolutely make them work. But they are best delivered bald.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most students, the end of May typically brings a feeling of accomplishment and relaxation, as most students have finished their finals and gone their separate ways for the summer. But for No. 38 nationally-ranked sophomore Henry von der Schulenburg, the end of May, and specifically this past week, was nothing short of exhilarating. After his No.14, and The Harvard Crimson’s 2021-2022 Team of the Year, squad fell in the second round of the Division I Men’s Tennis NCAA team tournament to No. 18 Stanford, von der Schulenburg traveled with No. 60 junior teammate Harry Walker to Champaign, Illinois to compete in the NCAA singles tournament. Von der Schulenburg and Walker led the way for Harvard this past year in the first two positions, and finished with 27-9 and 20-4 singles records, respectively. They were subsequently rewarded with tickets punched to the singles tournament and an opportunity to cement their spots among the best collegiate tennis players in the nation.
“The tournament was an awesome experience,” von der Schulenburg said. “It felt more like a pro tournament than a college tournament.”
In the first round of the tournament, the sophomore faced off against No. 59 Olivier Stewart of Illinois. Von der Schulenburg acknowledged that there were certainly some nerves going into the tournament, and this opening match, specifically, but he knew he’d have as good a shot as anyone to make a deep run in the tournament as long as he stuck to the fundamentals and stayed sharp. And stay sharp he did in the first match, as he cruised to a victory in straight sets, 6-1, 6-3.
“[Walker] won before me, which gave me a lot of confidence that both of us were ready for the challenge,” von der Schulenburg said. “Getting that first win is huge. You basically want to get the train rolling.”
Walker similarly dominated in the first round, with a 6-3, 6-2 upset victory over No. 47 Kody Pearson of the University of Tulsa. Walker and von der Schulenburg were the only two Ivy League players to advance to the round of 32 and the first Crimson players to advance to the second round of the singles tournament since formerly No. 34 Dennis Nguyen in 2015. Their work was far from over at this point, though, as the matchups for the round of 32 were now set: von der Schulenburg was to take on No. 12 Luc Fomba of TCU, while Walker drew the toughest matchup of all against No. 1 Daniel Rodrigues of South Carolina.
In the second round, von der Schulenburg once again found himself in front after the first set, 6-4, but he acknowledged that this match was a much tougher battle.
“I knew the second round was going to be tough because Fomba is a great player. He has a huge serve and big shots. But I knew that my game works well against him,” the sophomore explained. “Especially outdoors, my spin forehand into his one-handed backhand was a game changer. Obviously, I was nervous because I had one more match to win in order for me to make All-American status. But because I knew I had put in the work and that the coaches believed in me I stayed confident. He had set points to win the second set but it all worked out in the end and I was able to close out the match [in straight sets].”
Despite Fomba’s best efforts to come back, von der Schulenburg fended off his attacks to finish the match’s second set, 7-6, clinching All-American status, the first time the honor had been awarded to anyone on the team since Nguyen in 2014. It’s both a significant achievement for Harvard and a terrific way to solidify this season’s place in the team’s long history. While von der Schulenburg is incredibly proud of this individual achievement, he acknowledges that it would not have been possible without constant support from his teammates and coaches.
“The biggest thing about [becoming an All-American] is that people will look up at the banner and see that it’s possible to get there. Hopefully it can be an inspiration to the entire team,” von der Schulenburg said. “That being said, I could never have done it without every single member on the team. We push each other in practice and in matches and that’s the beauty of college tennis. We’ve all improved so much this year and achieved all of our goals that we set at the beginning of the season. Now it’s time to take this program to the next level.”
On the other court, Walker engaged in a fierce battle against Rodrigues in perhaps the biggest match of his collegiate career. After dropping the first set, 5-7, the junior fought back to tie things up after two sets with a solid 6-4 performance in the second frame. Eventually, Rodrigues capitalized on a few too many of Walker’s errors, taking the third set, 6-3, eliminating the junior from the tournament.
“[Walker] was the better player for most of the match. He had a couple of chances to win the match. But that’s why [Rodrigues] is so good because he never goes away,” von der Schulenburg said. “[Walker] can be really proud of himself because he worked so hard to get where he is now and he has so much more potential. I have no doubt that he’ll come back even stronger next year and take his game to the next level.”
In the round of 16, von der Schulenburg faced yet another stiff challenge in the name of No. 3 Adam Walton of Tennessee. Already having overachieved, according to the pre-tournament rankings, and in possession of one of the highest honors a collegiate player could attain, the sophomore was ready to test his ability to stick it out with the best in the country. In the first set, von der Schulenburg was edged out narrowly, 7-6. In the second set, von der Schulenburg held on for as long as he could but was unable to hold off Walton in the end, falling 3-6 and ending his spectacular run in the tournament.
“This match gave me a lot of confidence because I saw how close I am to the top and I just have to put in more work to get there,” von der Schulenburg said.
Von der Schulenburg’s defeat marked the official end of all collegiate tennis competition for the Crimson. Coming off a lost year during the pandemic, it was still a historic season for Harvard: an ECAC championship, top 15 national team ranking, Ivy League Championship, and berths in both the individual and team NCAA tournaments were just some of the many goals the Crimson had set for itself going into the year, and it achieved every single one of the them. And with only No.66 senior captain Brian Shi graduating, Harvard will return next year hungrier than ever to make waves in college tennis and build on their successes this year.
