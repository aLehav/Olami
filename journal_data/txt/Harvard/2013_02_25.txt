After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stop by one of the general meetings of the Harvard College Voice Actors’ Guild and you’re sure to be bombarded by myriad accents from across the world. When chatting with just one member of the group, you might find yourself listening first to a British accent, next to a Southern drawl, and finally to an impression of a famous actor or cartoon character, interspersed with laser gun sounds—all in the course of a brief conversation.
The Voice Actors’ Guild, which seeks to promote the art of voice acting for radio and film, began in the hallowed halls of Annenberg, where the club’s current president, Taylor A. Cressler ’14, and a couple of friends would often meet for dinner during their freshman year to practice different accents. “We realized that there was no place on campus where you can learn how to do accents or do any sort of simple voice acting,” Cressler says. “It’s all stage and film acting.” Cressler’s efforts to fill that gap in the acting community met with success in early 2012, when the club received official recognition from the College.
For the first year of its existence, the Voice Actors’ Guild focused mainly on hosting accent workshops. Now the club is branching out to include a wider variety of projects, ranging from a voice-only production of George Bernard Shaw’s “Arms and the Man” to a re-recording of a Flash Gordon radio series from the 1930s. Teis D. Jorgensen ’14 is directing a third project—a play entitled “Conversations” that features improvisation. The play starts off with a brief, scripted dialogue between two characters, but then moves into an improvised conversation. “After the beginning, the script fades out and the actors improv and use their voices to develop the conflict, their relationship to one another, and the resolution,” Jorgensen says. None of the projects have a set release date, but the group hopes to complete all three by the end of the semester.
Although similar to stage and film acting, voice acting has its own unique challenges, Cressler says. Voice actors rely on speech alone, so they have to devise ways to convey their meaning without physical acting or facial expression. “People don’t realize it going through everyday life, but body language is a huge part of communication,” Cressler says. “If you take that away, you really have to overcompensate for any lost meaning.” Jorgensen argues that making stories come to life for the listening audience without the use of props and costumes is the greatest challenge voice actors face. In a voice-only play, actors must establish a setting and flesh out their characters using only their voice and, perhaps, additional sound effects.
While voice acting is just a hobby for many of the club’s members, for others participation in the Voice Actors’ Guild is a stepping stone to a potential future career. Cressler hopes to pursue a career in acting after college and recognizes that being an experienced voice actor has advantages when auditioning for roles in the future. “If you can master a good voice, then it’s a lot easier to get both voice-acting roles and movie roles,” Cressler says.
Alexander J. Iascone ’16, another hopeful future actor and member of the Voice Actor’s Guild, agrees. “When you’re auditioning for a role, anything you can do to make the director see you more as the character is helpful,” he says. “If the character is from a certain area and you’ve mastered that accent, then you’ll be better suited for the role.”
Jorgensen, who does not plan to pursue a career in acting after graduating, acknowledges that he has learned many interpersonal skills from his experiences voice acting and directing voice-acting projects. Learning to convey intent and emotion through speech helps him interact in new settings.
There are other perks to being in the Voice Actors’ Guild, according to Iascone. “I can impress girls with all my different accents,” he says, laughing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Your mother is not your mother. Your father is not your father. Your friends are not your friends,” says the voice from a rotating record in the final scene of “punkplay.” Alone and desperate, kindred spirits Mickey (Matt J. Bialo ’15) and Duck (Mark J. Mauriello ’15) come together to form a band, zoo sluts, and immerse themselves in punk counterculture, hoping to find a niche for themselves as they struggle to navigate through their teenage years. Gregory S. Moss’s “punkplay,” directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and running through March 2 in the Loeb Ex, is heavy in testosterone and crude language, yet surprisingly sensitive and insightful as it details a misfit’s quest for individualism in an era built on conformity.
The emotional core of the play is the chemistry of its leads, Bialo and Mauriello. Mauriello’s character, Duck, is thrown out by his father for his refusal to go to military school. Mauriello portrays his character as flamboyant and outrageous, spitting in the face of authority with his dyed hair and smudged eyeliner. It would be easy for Mauriello to overwhelm Bialo, whose character is less physically arresting and whose development is much more subtle, but instead, the two act as perfect foils.
At the emotional climax of the play, Mickey and Duck must confront their rapidly changing bond: in a typical high school scene, Duck betrays Mickey in an effort to look cool for the town’s resident punk idol (Christian N. Fohrby ’14 ). Duck and Mickey engage in a fistfight that quickly alternates between a romantic slow dance and a progressively violent brawl. The entirety of the play takes place on roller skates, and in this scene, Bialo and Mauriello skate around each other figuratively and literally as they grapple with the different facets of their relationship.
The leads’ constantly shifting rapport and the underlying franticness of the play’s punk-tinged edges are enhanced by the clever lighting design of Alexandra M. Kiley ’15 and Anna G. Kelsey ’14. The play appears as a series of vignettes strung together by the lighting, which provides seamless transitions between the scenes. Flashing in a dizzying array of red and blue, the lighting is coupled with punk music and teenage head-banging as weeks and months blend together. Without the lighting, the play would fall apart; it compresses time in a way that contributes to the play’s sharp and caustic tongue as well as its sporadic nature.
Brandt manages to bring out the inner struggle of the characters throughout the play, which is at its core a coming-of-age story. He communicates the theme of the play particularly well in Mickey’s dream sequence, which opens with a talking chair, a body of Mickey’s paramour Sue Gici (Lily R. Glimcher ’14) with the head of Ronald Reagan, a pedantic clock, and a picture of Jesus Christ. In less than nimble hands, the scene would be an incoherent mess, but Brandt manages to create a sense of order by using windows to frame the elements—a picture of Jesus Christ in one, which represents Mickey’s consciousness, and a clock in the other. Against the backdrop of the flashing lights, the scene becomes a perverse confessional hearing, a unique dramatic feat thanks to the successful partnership between director and lighting designers.
The play conveys a distinct feeling of intrusion through Brandt's set design. All of the action takes place in Mickey’s room, enclosed by three walls. Scenes that take place outside of the room are never actually seen; rather, they seem to seep in through the doors. Despite Mickey and Duck’s attempt to break free from the shackles of society through their immersion in punk, they find themselves stuck in a self-imposed cage—the conformity of the punk scene, signified by the claustrophobic set. It feels ironic that the set design places the two teenagers in the center of the action, when they try so hard to stay on the periphery of society.
Brandt’s production of “punkplay” manages to comment on a larger theme even as it incorporates unconventional scenes, non-standard props like roller skates, and a limited set where the action takes place. In the end it is the idea of personal identity and counterculture in the ’80s that emerge as the strongest parts of the production.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given that Seth MacFarlane has built his career on being as bombastically outrageous as possible, he shouldn't have been surprised when his attempts to laugh off a terrible opening monologue were unconvincing.
The majority of the content of the 2013 Oscars left us mostly wondering what any of it had to do with the 2013 Oscars. A musical revue featuring "Dreamgirls" and "Chicago," frequent pictures of John Travolta in "Hairspray," and weird, patronizing clips about why technical work is important were only some of the wonders to which the audience was subjected last night.
Thankfully, the weirdness subsided for the actual award recipients, among whom there were few surprises. Christoph Waltz and Anne Hathaway were bestowed Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Actress in a Supporting Role, respectively, and both predictably received their awards with bashful glee.
Quentin Tarantino, replete in leather tie as he accepted his Best Original Screenplay win for "Django Unchained," contrasted the muted acceptance of "Argo" for Best Adapted Screenplay with a satisfying inability to act normal in a public setting. Meryl Streep barely looked at the envelope before announcing Daniel Day-Lewis as the winner for Best Actor. (Bonus points for Joaquin Phoenix's nearly audible sigh during his competitor zoom-in.)
Jennifer Lawrence received a similar perfunctory huzzah, tripping over herself in the cutest Zooey Deschanel fashion on her way to collect her award onstage. Adele sang dramatically, and Ben Affleck was lovably earnest and uncomposed in accepting the Best Picture award for "Argo," using more sports metaphors than there are in "Silver Linings Playbook." Daniel Radcliffe and Kristen Stewart awkwardly presented an award with the noticeable absence of their common link—one Mr. Cedric Diggory. It was an idealized picture of the status quo, save for Ang Lee's "Life of Pi," which took home a Best Director award and the tiger's share of the technical awards.
Then again, there was that moment when Jack Nicholson and Michelle Obama strangely tag-teamed the Best Picture announcement. For a hot second, we thought that this was gearing up for a "Zero Dark Thirty" win quickly followed by a rousing chant of "GM is alive. Bin Laden is dead."
Alas, the only true surprise about the whole night was how genuinely anticlimactic it was, and thus it seems sadly appropriate that Seth MacFarlane dropped insults about Quentin Tarantino's style or Jean Dujardin's flagging career that could have been made six months ago. However, given the year's genuinely exciting crop of films—from Lana Del Rey Jr.'s precious love story on Cape Cod to Philip Seymour Hoffman's masterful turn to the best Bond movie in years—it seems strange that such a cavalcade of talent did not express itself last night in the slightest. Mic drop.
Winners: "Life of Pi," Meryl Streep, Quentin Tarantino
Losers: Seth MacFarlane, "Zero Dark Thirty," The Oscars

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student activists and union members have led recent protests in support of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents 4,600 employees, during the longest contract negotiations between the University and HUCTW in history. Among the negotiation’s most contentious issues is a disagreement over wage increases. While HUCTW portrays the University’s current offer as unjust, Harvard’s proposed salary increases, well above local inflation, are both fair and reasonable.
With an average salary of $50,000 as of 2011 and wage increases consistently beating local inflation, HUCTW workers are paid well above competitive market rates—average compensation is at the 75th percentile for the industry. The University’s three-year offer for a salary increase of 2.8 percent in the first year, 2.5 percent in the second, and two percent in the third are fair in comparison to the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of a 1.7 percent inflation rate for the Boston area. Perhaps the University’s offer is not luxurious, but it is certainly not exploitative.
Compared to the rest of the country, where hourly pay has stagnated since 2000 when adjusted for inflation, HUCTW workers have fared much better even when compared with cost of living increases in the Boston area. From 2002-2011, based on data on HUCTW’s website and BLS statistics, real wages for HUCTW members have increased 13.7 percent. While this increase might be viewed as modest, union leaders cannot in good faith claim that the University has treated the union unfairly.
Admittedly, HUCTW’s actions are understandable—it is, after all, the role of a labor union to advocate for the best possible outcome for its members. But to a dispassionate observer, the union’s rejection of Harvard’s reasonable offer seems a fallacious dramatization of the contract negotiations as something of a Dickensian dispute between a rich university and its mistreated workers.
The most troubling and pernicious assertions made by some are the insinuations that the University’s large endowment and recent expansions make it somehow obligated to agree to hefty wage increases. To the contrary, the University’s endowment exists to allocate funds towards programs—like the investment in EdX or campus renovations—that advance the priorities and educational mission of Harvard most effectively. To say that the University’s endowment makes it liable to increase its already fair contract offer is to ignore the realities of the job market, where compensation is based on the value of a job in the marketplace rather than institutional wealth.
We hope that HUCTW members will urge their leaders to bring a swift end to the protracted contract negotiations. Ending this prolonged fight is in the interest of HUCTW, the University, and the students whom they both seek to serve.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As many in the Harvard community know, the University and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers,  representing 4,600 skilled office and laboratory staff, have been in protracted negotiations over pay and benefits since March 2012.
During the course of negotiations, management negotiators have stated that their salary increase offers are “consistent with the job markets.” This prompts the logical question: If that’s the case, why has there not yet been an agreement?
Although it may be true that the University’s pay proposals are consistent with current market trends, that does not mean that those proposals can sustain the lives of the hard-working staff. Like the rest of the country, Harvard’s middle class workforce has taken a huge hit over the last few years due to constrained wage growth and other effects of the economic recession. We have been struggling to pay bills and hold on to homes—some have not succeeded. These excerpts from union members’ letters to Harvard administrators illustrate this unfortunate direction:
“The 2010 salary increase meant 19 dollars a week before taxes. As a single mother of four, that doesn’t even cover bus fare for the week. When my children aren’t feeling well, I’ve found myself wondering, ‘Does he/she really need to see the doctor?’ Sometimes I am choosing between groceries and co-pays.”
“Our rent went up by $100 a month. I have had to decide between using my dwindling savings or not paying a bill so that my family could buy food for another week. We don’t ever buy meat. My wife and I live on the bare edge as we work with a credit consolidation company to pay off our debt. It almost brings me to tears to write this. My daughter wants to take swim lessons—not an unreasonable request—but we can’t afford it.”
“We have sold pretty much everything of value to keep up with the mortgage payments. As a mother, I want to be able to do more. Maybe buy a ticket to a museum or some clothes that didn’t come from a second-hand store. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed them, and I’m just not used to that.”
Any thoughtful Harvard citizen has to ask, is this the philosophy or the business model on which the University’s greatness is founded? Do administrative leaders believe we should organize the institution around a goal of capitalizing on destructive trends in a wage-depressed job market? When a staff member is worried about whether she can pay for groceries, is she likely to do her best work? Is this the way to build a skillful, committed staff, working hand-in-hand with Harvard faculty and students every day?
Of course, union members understand that the crisis didn’t only batter members’ family finances—it hit University finances as well. Harvard’s endowment lost a substantial amount of value in 2008-2009. But one of the primary ways the University cut spending in 2009 was to reduce staffing without diminishing the amount of work. Staff members (union and non-union) have been doing the jobs of departed colleagues on top of their own work for more than three years . Members have found creative ways to do more with less, as well as working countless hours of uncompensated extra time, in an effort at good citizenship. Yet now, as the endowment has recovered much of its value and the University returns to bold investment in new projects, Harvard seems frustratingly reluctant to recognize the efforts of the staff.
One union member writes, “Harvard staff are some of the most skilled and talented administrative workers in the Boston area. We choose to bring our talents to Harvard because we love what we do here—but we also choose to be at Harvard because the total compensation package meets our needs. Support staff members deserve the dignity of being able to maintain a middle-class lifestyle throughout their careers here.”
HUCTW members understand administrators’ concerns about financial instability. For this reason, we’ve put forward proposals that tie raises to inflation, so that if the economy gets worse, Harvard’s financial obligation to staff will be smaller. Our health care proposals are cost-neutral for the University, and we have suggested curve-bending ideas that would reduce health expenses for Harvard and for all employees. We consider administrators’ concerns about economic uncertainty to be shared concerns. We need for management negotiators to look on the Union’s pay and benefit proposals with that same spirit of mutuality.
A mutually supportive community, in which Harvard takes care of its staff and the staff takes care of Harvard, is critical. Real wage growth will prevent the problems of poverty from seeping further into our workforce. Affordable health care for employees at all levels is essential to preserve a middle class standard of living. But a balanced, progressive bargain is also critical for the future of Harvard. A great University needs a great staff.  Harvard administrators should show that they appreciate our skillful contribution and commitment by settling our contract fairly now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I puzzled over my college decision in April 2010, an interviewer from a smaller, quainter institution than Harvard sent me a detailed message, enumerating the reasons why not to go Crimson. For starters, life on the Charles was just too damned crowded, with eager undergrads swept to the wayside as the University doted on law, business, and medical students. Classes were oversized and understaffed. And if one could believe it, Harvard students were just as deprived outside the classroom—parties were anathema, and there was nary a Gothic steeple to be found.
Unimpressed by the Princeton representative’s hokum and unconcerned about the absence of Gothic towers, I chose Harvard and haven’t regretted it for a moment. Contra Harvard haters, the last five semesters have graced me with generous financial assistance, faculty friendships, one- and three-student classes, and my share of unforgettable college nights.
However, there’s a grain of truth at the heart of the anti-Harvard polemicist’s argument when it comes to the finishing touches. That is to say, as much as I enjoy the elegant neo-Georgian snowfall proceeding outside my window, the University’s lack of attention to good campus grooming will come back into relief when the sun comes out in melting force. While Harvard’s aesthetic charm—rendered in colonial brick, river-spanning bridges, and breezy courtyards—needs no introduction, our beautiful campus is pockmarked with both landscaping mistakes and architectural abominations. As the University gears up for a billion-dollar House renewal campaign, it must seize the opportunity to put things right—for the sake of its students’ happiness and its legacy of good taste.
No matter how much we’ve gotten accustomed to it, the elephant in the room continues to prattle noisily away. Every time we loop around Allston on our way back to school across the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge, we’re arrested amidst the bricks and the bell towers: first by Pyongyang-worthy Mather, then the sci-fi clunkiness of the Leverett towers, the cinderblock hell of New Quincy, and finally the titanic brutalism of the block-long Holyoke Center. Venturing farther inland, the pulsing heart of campus is sclerotized with such architectural abortions as Canaday Hall, William James Hall, and the somewhat more defensible Science Center.
Worst of all, however, are the cracked asphalt walkways that menace both our House courtyards and Harvard Yard, the historic center of our campus tradition. No matter the difference a new coat of black shine makes, the administration’s shortsighted fetish for tarmac stands aptly for a university that believes its appeal has transcended aesthetics entirely. With the reintroduction of early action to its admissions policy, Harvard College faces a yield rate of approximately 80 percent—unparalleled among peer institutions—reducing its immediate incentives to dazzle prospective students. The difference is stark: as Winthrop courtyard cracks with neglect, other elite universities lay their walkways with brick, stone, and all manner of pavers in a feverish attempt to upstage Harvard’s incomparable 377-year-old brand. It is a great shame to see Harvard students return from New Haven, Princeton, or Allston in awe of the cumulative effects of superior landscaping and paving: With over $30 billion at our disposal, we can certainly do better.
In the 1930s, the University demonstrated exceptional taste and clarity in deciding to build the upperclassman House system along the lines of Harvard’s pre-existing neo-Georgian tradition. Call it monotonous, but unlike most of the Northeast’s medieval European copycat campuses, it can be said that Harvard has a style of its own—part and parcel of the American tradition, well integrated into its Cambridge surroundings, and puritanically modest in the tradition of its founders.
Attempts to modernize the Harvard aesthetic have categorically failed. Rather unlike the calculated brutalism of Georgetown’s Lauinger Library or the desert minimalism of Yale’s Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, our mid-century architectural additions continue to feel tentative, their carpeted floors and poured-concrete walls considered only in terms of trade-offs: unmitigated ugliness in exchange for elevators, bigger rooms, and more parties.
As a Winthropian, I’ve been told, I have no right to judge: Critics assail my House for being roach-infested, cramped, and poorly-maintained. Fair, I respond. However, current plans for House renewal seem well positioned to address these problems—while failing to account for the fact that regardless of internal conditions, the Harvard we return to as alumni will remain blighted by the mistakes of a few nihilistic architects of the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s.
If there is anything we’ve learned since, it is that taste is a bounded matter: Styles might very well change over the years, but there exists an objective pale that we ought never to cross. For the sake of Harvard’s durability as an American icon and competitiveness as a contemporary brand, let’s not be afraid to call for an erasure of our campus’ architectural mistakes while we still have a chance. If the administration wants to make a truly worthwhile investment out of House renewal, it would be wise to go all the way: Bring out the wrecking balls, and beautify Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years ago, I sat in Sanders Theater for the first time, surrounded by future freshmen, and listened to President Drew G. Faust address the potential class of 2015. In her speech she talked a lot about different aspects of Harvard and Harvard life, but one story stuck out. In response to a parent’s question about the lack of vocational education at Harvard, Faust told us about a recent Slavic languages graduate who finished at Harvard as one of the world’s leading minds in the field. She then went on to explain that he was currently in medical school and planned to become a surgeon. Clearly, at Harvard you could concentrate in anything and leave being able to do anything you wanted.
Most of my experience at Harvard has only reinforced this. My roommate is a Romance languages and literatures concentrator who plans to go into public policy. Another friend is a joint math and English concentrator. However, there seems to be an exception to the anti-vocational oasis that is Harvard. Where does the most notoriously vocational concentration, engineering sciences, fall in the surrounding ocean of liberal arts concentrations?
The answer is that it doesn’t. It simply can’t. When a student graduates from most concentrations, he or she is an educated individual ready to learn how to be successful in any career. When a student graduates with a Bachelor of Science in engineering, he or she is a qualified engineer. Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences preaches to prospective undergraduates that students can “enjoy the intellectual energy of a liberal arts college where they can engage in scholarship spanning the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities” and pursue an engineering degree. However, in the introductory meeting of this spring’s sophomore engineering forum, recently declared concentrators such as myself were told that we had to “make choices” and that we couldn’t expect to concentrate in engineering and also pursue a secondary field, study abroad, and write theses.
For students like Stephanie R. Warner ’15, who chose Harvard because she “wanted [her] undergraduate experience to be one that was truly interdisciplinary,” or Rishi Goel ’15, who said he transferred from the University of Texas to Harvard because he was “not just getting an education for [his] career; [but rather] getting an education for [his] life,” this statement came as quite a shock.
I too am tempted to rail against this statement and demand that Harvard engineering live up to its promise of a liberal arts education. However, such a demand would be unreasonable. In its current state, it is impossible for Harvard engineering to also offer a true liberal arts education, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
To earn a Bachelor of Science in engineering sciences, one must take between 20 and 24 half-courses. The unaccredited Bachelor of Arts degree in engineering, at 14-16 half-courses, still requires more than most Harvard concentrations. It is barely possible to have what could be considered a liberal arts education within the S.B. program.
Sophomore Leah P. Gaffney ’15 will graduate with an S.B. in biomedical engineering and a secondary field in global health and health policy in four years, but only because “[she] came in knowing that [she] was interested in engineering and with a math background through multivariable [calculus].” For most others, like alumna Sarah Campbell ’12, wanting a Harvard liberal arts experience meant giving up the validity of an S.B. degree and “choosing the A.B. track because it allowed for [her] to pursue a secondary and/or citation.”
During sophomore fall, I faced a similar decision between pursing an accredited and more legitimate S.B. degree or an A.B. degree—three years without a single elective as opposed to a path where I could take other Harvard classes and potentially study abroad but would forfeit my ability to work as an engineer without significant make-up work in graduate school.
Harvard is consistently ranked first in the U.S. News and World Report’s best universities. But in 2012, Harvard engineering ranked 19th among undergraduate engineering programs, falling well below Ivy competitors such as Cornell and Princeton, at eighth and 10th, respectively, and MIT and Stanford, ranked first and second.  Despite the discrepancies in rankings, prospective engineers are picking Harvard. In just five years, Harvard number of Harvard engineering concentrators has doubled in size, testifying that engineering students are increasingly seeking the balanced education Harvard promises. Yet a balanced engineering education does not exist in the form promised.
Harvard is one of very few institutions that attempts to make a liberal arts engineering degree a viable option, but it hasn’t quite succeeded in doing so.  As long as engineering concentrators have to make choices between becoming an accredited engineer versus pursuing a secondary or studying abroad, we cannot truly become liberal arts engineers.
In the current system, this is impossible, but change is possible. Perhaps it means that Harvard needs to let engineers stay for five years or accept AP or IB math and physics credits to give engineers a head start on their requirements. Harvard’s engineering program is close to becoming the liberal arts oasis it promises to be—I urge the College and SEAS to push for changes that permit every Harvard student to pursue both engineering legitimacy and liberal arts breadth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dining halls were adorned with yellow and green tablecloths and filled with students enjoying avocado and salsa during Harvard University Dining Services’ Brazilian barbecue Sunday. HUDS provided the creative brunch in response to a fall survey, in which students chose Brazilian as the theme for the annual festive spring meal.
The selection of Brazilian food included roast beef, marinated grilled chicken breast, chorizo and cilantro omelet, vegetarian feijoada, and Brazilian banana cake.
Several students said they enjoyed the authentic feel of the cuisine. Zachary R. Berger ’15 and Jonathan Ludmir ’16, both from Miami, Fla., said the barbecue items reminded them of home.
“It’s exactly like eating from these Brazilian steakhouses,” Berger said. “I wouldn’t know the difference.”
Hayley H. Arader ’16, who called herself an expert on South American cuisine, also deemed the food “authentic.”
“I like Brazilian food a lot,” she said. “The bananas chips were really good. I was happy about [the meal].”
Students, used to typical winter HUDS fare, said they appreciated the temporary but extensive change in cuisine.
Yinka A. Akintujoye ’16 said that ethnic-themed meals are more “fun” than individual dishes “like random Korean barbecue” sporadically served by the dining halls.
Akintujoye said she thought that the food was good overall, but that some of the elements of the food fest seemed “unnecessary.”
“I feel like the staff probably didn’t want to be walking around dressed up in pseudo Brazilian garb,” she said, referencing the hats donned by the dining hall workers in honor of the event.
Along with the Brazilian food, Cabot and Pforzheimer Houses provided an additional surprise for their students. The two houses treated students to a capoeira  performance by Contra-Mestre Chuvisquinho, leader of Sinha Capoeira Dance School in Boston, and four of his students. Capoeira is a form of martial arts originating from Brazil which incorporates elements of dance and music.
“Brazil is a country that draws a lot of people to its culture through food and dancing,” said Chuvisquinho. “When a university opens the door for our culture, it’s exciting.”
The demonstration was received enthusiastically  by the surprised students.
“The performance was really cool. I’ve never seen anything like that before,” Rachel Park ’15 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a two-part series examining how the looming cuts in federal funding could impact research at Harvard. Part II ran on Feb. 26.
Without a deal to avert unprecedented federal spending cuts scheduled to take effect Friday, research institutions including Harvard could be days away from the most damaging reduction of research funding in recent memory.
The cuts—projected to be $85 billion from the federal balance sheets this fiscal year alone—are as unparalleled in scope as the problem, a $900 billion yearly federal deficit that Congress has forced itself to plug. As lawmakers warn of the threat such a deficit poses to federal government’s financial integrity, researchers and administrators at Harvard warn that what they call indiscriminate and poorly timed cuts could jeopardize the flow of new scientific ideas and those who generate them at a time when the economy stands to benefit from them more than ever.
In total, the automatic cuts to all federal programs, better known as sequestration, are slated to progressively trim $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. After years of flat funding and increased demand for federal sponsorship, the University’s researchers, investigators, and administrators say the cuts, if enacted, will cast a long shadow over research at Harvard, where individual labs from the Medical School to the Faculty of Art and Sciences received approximately $650 million in federal monies during the 2012 fiscal year.
Some agencies have already reduced grant totals in advance of the cuts, forcing labs across the University to proactively trim costs and refocus their research. At the same time, administrators have begun the process of reorienting the way the University solicits funding.
“The bottom line for us is that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what will happen if sequestration goes into effect,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview last week. “We expect regardless of whether Congress averts the fiscal cliff or not, that there will be serious long-term cuts in research spending, in real terms and in nominal terms.”
DANGLING OVER THE CLIFF
Lawmakers originally passed sequestration into law as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 in an effort to force themselves to address the growing debt by the end of 2012. Though a last-minute tax deal on January 1 temporarily postponed that deadline until March 1, the effect of the sequester will be much the same: across-the-board cuts to federal programs from Medicare to the Department of Defense.
Given that academic institutions like Harvard currently depend on the federal government for approximately 60 percent of funding for research and development, the threat of sequestration looms large.
The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, the two largest sources of research funding for Harvard investigators, could each face immediate cuts of 5 percent, the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars in the first year alone. The United States Department of Defense, the third largest University funding source, could experience cuts of 7 percent.
While 16 percent of the University’s overall operating revenue during the 2012 fiscal year came from federal sponsorship, certain schools like the School of Public Health, the Medical School, and various departments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, rely more heavily on federal funds. University leaders have actively taken steps to lobby in Washington and administrators on campus representing each school are looking to shore up the funding they do have and explore new sources of funding from the private sector.
Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk said these blunt cuts could jeopardize the continuity and robustness of scientific research.
“Health research cannot be turned on or off by a spigot,” he said.
Fifty-five percent of the School of Public Health’s operating budget in FY 2012 came from government sponsorship, more than any other school at Harvard.
Immediately behind the School of Public Health, the Medical School drew 34 percent of its operating budget last year from federal funding, primarily from the NIH and NSF.
Within FAS, the effect of cuts will vary from department to department, with the biology and physics departments being hit harder and the humanities largely remaining unscathed.
Though specific details are unclear, both the NIH and NSF have said they expect to reduce award amounts for existing multi-year grants and significantly cut the number and amount of future grants, most likely to the tune of approximately 1,000 fewer grants a year, according to the most recent White House advisory.
Because the NIH announced late last year that it was withholding 10 percent of the promised award amount for all grants in advance of the possible sequester, many researchers have already begun to feel the pinch of the cuts.
That sharp reduction in grant numbers is expected to reduce already low award rates in the NIH and NSF to 14 and 16 percent respectively, according to a report by Research!America—an organization that advocates for research funding.
Even if sequestration does not occur, Harvard administrators are still gearing up for what many believe will be inevitable budget cuts.
“There is general agreement that whatever happens with sequestration, the profile for research funding from the federal government is going to be a different one going forward,” University President Drew G. Faust said.
SHUTTING DOWN THE PIPELINE
Though the numbers are most striking at the University level, individual labs and researchers will bear the brunt of the cuts as competition for grants becomes more difficult and awards shrink in size.
In September 2012, Medical School biologist Robin E. Reed announced that her lab had discovered a long-sought-after link between spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, better known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. That finding, which came after five years of basic research on a protein related to ALS, has the potential break the field wide open, Reed said.
But like dozens of her colleagues at the Medical School and thousands more around the country feeling the impact of shrinking federal funding, Reed finds herself increasingly on the sidelines, spending less time in the laboratory and more than ever before writing grants to try maintain her piece of the funding pie.
“I have an idea, and I think it’s a good one, but I simply don’t have the money to pursue it,” Reed said. “Before you would write a grant and get a decent amount of money so you could do work. Now you have to spend a lot of time just writing grants, and that’s not a productive use of my time.”
“On the one hand, the public says cure this awful disease, and on the other hand, they won’t even give us enough money to even buy the reagents,” she added.
Though Harvard researchers will likely weather the cuts better than others because of the high caliber of their work, assistant professor of both computer science and biology David D. Cox ’00 said the overall reduction of funds will mean that both funding agencies and researchers will become more conservative with the grant money they do have.
In advance of potential cuts, researchers have sought to minimize some of the losses at the lab level by cutting staff and spending more frugally on expensive chemicals and equipment.
“I just think it’s having a major impact in every area. Labs are shrinking. Money is dried up, so I can’t imagine it drying it up any more,” Reed said.
While private industry and charitable foundations are willing to put up dollars for applied, late-stage research, federal sponsorship has traditionally provided for early-stage, basic inquiry. Researchers said they worry that federal agencies like the NIH and NSF will begin funding a larger number of applied research or basic projects that seem to be sure bets, leaving traditional basic research projects underfunded.
“Sometimes the benefits that you get from basic research are much, much broader, much more broadly applicable, and they are more of a public good,” Garber said. “Some of the most fundamental breakthroughs in areas like treatment of diseases come from basic research.”
Scientists who conduct basic research said that it often yields big breakthroughs that lay the groundwork for applied technologies, medical treatments, and drugs that drive industry. Once basic research dries up, they said, applied research will follow.
“In academia, we are the ones who can take longterm views, and basically do the sort of fundamental science even when it’s not clear what the payoff will be,” said Cox, a former Crimson design editor. “So if you take that pipeline and you stall it...it’s going to have a huge adverse effect on the economy.”
A LOST GENERATION
The threat to basic research affects not only the output of scientific ideas but also the output of scientists themselves. Basic research is the bread and butter of University-based scientific inquiry, and as it shrinks, so will the ranks of the academy.
“The pipeline of scientific breakthroughs also depends on the pipeline of talent,” said Medical School Executive Dean of Research William W. Chin flanked by prominent Massachusetts politicians and health researchers at a rally in mid-February. “Its flow cannot be turned down without long-term consequences. A generation of scientists could be lost in a period of profound funding reduction.”
Researchers, young and old, said the problem facing young scientists is two-fold. Because better-established labs tend to have a more proven track record, they are likely to get a greater share of support from increasingly conservative funding agencies looking more and more toward results. Consequently, junior faculty trying to establish new labs can expect to have a harder time getting funded.
Universities like Harvard offer seed money to promising scientists to get their research off the ground, said Cox, whose interdisciplinary lab is less than a year old. But that money does not last forever and securing grants to replace it in a stagnant funding climate can be difficult.
“I think everybody’s feeling pressure. It’s a slightly terrifying time to be starting out in research because the long term prospects are very uncertain,” Cox said. He explained that he currently has five different NSF proposals under consideration, whereas usual circumstances might warrant two.
But for many, particularly those still in graduate school or in post-doctoral fellowships, the prospects are more perilous. Federal cuts over the next decade could, researchers said, be enough to push this young talent away from academic research.
Whether those young scientists move abroad to emerging research hubs in Beijing or Berlin, or leave the field altogether, University researchers worry about the long-term effects on their fields.
“These sequestration cuts, without being too overly dramatic, could be the next step on what many have been predicting over the last half dozen years as the loss of an entire generation of brilliant scientists,” said Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Jeffrey D. Macklis. “As a senior investigator, who has a reputation in the field and can be successful in getting grants from multiple sources, I can buffer myself through this storm, but there are incredibly talented young investigators who are just being denied the ability to get started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Analyzing life expectancy data from over 101,000 people in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, Harvard School of Public Health professor Till W. Bärnighausen and his coworkers have documented one of the largest increases in a region’s life expectancy in history. Their findings were reported in the scholarly journal “Science” and published online last Friday.
The researchers found that life expectancy in the KwaZulu-Natal area has risen steeply, from 49.2 years in 2004 to 60.5 years in 2011. Those years span the period when antiretroviral therapy, a program of treatment also known as ART that is targeted at suppressing the progression of the human immunodeficiency virus, became available through public clinics in the region following a period of at least three years when life expectancy had been steadily falling.
Bärnighausen, an associate professor of Global Health at the School of Public Health, said the only other times when researchers have “observed such rapid increases [in life expectancy] were after the influenza epidemic of 1918 or when the plague disappeared in Europe.”
In 2003, the South African region had a 22 percent rate of HIV infection among its inhabitants, which Bärnighausen called “already extremely high.” But from 2003 to 2011, the portion of infected individuals rose to 30 percent.
“It’s good news that the prevalence is increasing,” said Bärnighausen, because even though there are more carriers of the virus, the higher rate of infection implies that “people who are HIV infected are now living longer.”
As the length of life increases in one age group, he said, the percentage of people who are infected with HIV also grows.
Bärnighausen said he thinks this study could have important political implications on the funding for HIV relief throughout all of Sub-Saharan Africa, where countries like Swaziland and Lesotho have national HIV infection rates of above 20 percent.
“Such evidence is valuable because it is proof that these efforts are having the impact that we couldn’t have hoped they would have,” Bärnighausen said. “Its one of the most worthwhile investments we can make in health at this point in time.”

The Harvard Law Review will more than double the number of editors focusing on online content for the publication next year in an effort to expand its web presence.
Increasing the online staff from two to five, these new editors will join the Forum Committee, which is responsible for developing the website and editing the material published online. In the next year, the Law Review hopes to enhance the functionality and design of its website in addition to increasing the quantity of published content, according to second-year Law School student Gillian S. Grossman ’10, the recently elected president who will lead 127th Volume of the organization.
“The new leaders dedicated a lot of effort to expanding our online presence, and they have some creative ideas about how they are going to do that,” said Conor S. Tochilin ’06, outgoing president of the Law Review.
The majority of returning editors voted to add two additional students to this year’s pool of rising editors in order to expand the online content while maintaining the quality of the current print operations, according to Grossman.
The Law Review will also grow the amount of material published online in an effort to increase the resources available for scholarly research.
“The Law Review recognizes that legal conversations and legal scholarship are taking place online in addition to print mediums,” Grossman wrote in an email. “The Law Review’s Forum provides a platform for authors to engage with the articles we publish in our print issues and to engage with current legal developments through various forms of online scholarship.”
In line with this mission, the Law Review began publishing its print materials online in 2006. The organization also created a “Forum” section on its website where contributors can write exclusively online content. In the past, these articles have come in the form of “Responses,” approximately 2,500 word pieces written in response to articles published in the print journal. With the new push towards expanding the Law Review’s web presence, the “Forum” will also begin publishing “Reactions,” shorter pieces commenting on recent developments in the law, as well as other scholarly essays.
Kimberly A. Dulin, associate director for collection development and digitization at the Harvard Law School Library, said she supports the Law Review’s initiative as part of a larger trend towards expanding open access in education.
“Definitely we’d love it,” Dulin said. “In general, it’s all to the good when the stuff that’s produced by professors is widely available for legal research and for free.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a recent anonymous op-ed in The Crimson that sparked a campus-wide conversation and a Friday rally on the subject of mental health, Undergraduate Council representatives used their general meeting Sunday to discuss steps that the organization could take in the coming weeks to address the issue.
The body passed with no opposition and only one abstention the “Mental Health at Harvard Act,” in which the UC resolved to hold a town hall meeting and publish an op-ed in The Crimson on mental health.
The legislation also referred to the recent op-ed on mental health services offered at Harvard that came the day before a spontaneous rally on mental health and the creation of the “Coalition to Reform Mental Health Services at Harvard.” With the act’s passage, the UC made official its support of the newly formed coalition, resolving that the UC would listen to the group’s concerns, provide it with “opportunities to engage with administrators,” and help with it with grassroots efforts.
“I think that we have a really unique opportunity right now to leverage whatever sort of influence and ability to organize that we have to address an issue that is a concern right now,” said Crimson Yard representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16.
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said during the meeting that she thought the potential for a referendum on the issue might be an important aspect of the larger role she envisions the UC playing in the ongoing conversation on mental health.
Representatives discussed other possible measures to address mental health concerns. Treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14 suggested the formation of a group of peer counselors unaffiliated with the University that could function as a supportive network for students. Representatives also floated the idea of the creation of a mental health fund in the Council budget.
During the meeting, the UC also finalized plans for its pilot, small-scale Junior Week scheduled to start this week. Representatives Christopher A. Smiles ’15 and Manik R. Kuchroo ’16, the pair responsible for coordinating Junior Week events, announced that this week’s events include a ‘Skate Night’ on Wednesday and a Class of 2014 Speaks event on Thursday night. The UC will also encourage  attendance at the women’s hockey “White the Bright” game against Yale this Saturday. Raghuveer urged the representatives to talk to juniors about attending all these events.
“We’re trying to build community on campus. The fact is, community on campus is not good, and I think a lot of the reason for that is because people here are individually motivated, everyone is always too busy to hang out,” Raghuveer said. “We need to fight that by bringing people to these really cool events.”
Newly appointed Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who attended the meeting, said briefly at the beginning that he thought it was important for him to hear the concerns of students. Lassonde will officially assume his position in March.

On senior night at Clarkson, it was the Harvard men’s hockey team’s freshmen that stole the show.
Rookie forwards Greg Gozzo and Kyle Criscuolo each had two goals, classmate Brayden Jaw had one score, freshmen Brian Hart and Jimmy Vesey both had two assists, and fellow newcomer Peter Traber made 29 saves to spark the Crimson to a 6-2 win over Clarkson.
Though Harvard (8-16-3, 5-13-2 ECAC) has struggled throughout the season and seems all but destined to finish last in the conference for the first time in ECAC history, the victory over the Golden Knights (9-16-7, 8-9-3) points towards a brighter future ahead for a squad that has struggled of late to turn highly-regarded recruiting classes into wins.
It was also a night Gozzo and Jaw will never forget, as each recorded his first career tally in the contest.
“I thought it was a really good team effort,” Traber said. “It was very good for our class.... It was good for [Gozzo] to get his first goal, and Brayden too. Both were very nice first goals, so it was nice to see.”
Clarkson got on the board first just 5:23 into the contest when Ben Sexton scored on the power play after his shot bounced off of a Harvard defender’s skate.
But two minutes later, following a tripping penalty on the Golden Knights’ Alex Boak, Harvard got its own man-up opportunity, and the Crimson took advantage. Vesey sent a cross-ice pass inside to Hart, and Clarkson goaltender Greg Lewis slid over to the right side of the net in anticipation of a Hart shot. But the rookie instead sent the puck to Criscuolo on the left side, giving the forward an open look from which to put it home.
It was just the 13th man-up goal of the season for Harvard, which is third worst in the nation in power-play percentage. The Crimson led the country in that category a year ago.
“[Vesey] threw a nice pass through their defenders to Brian Hart on the goal line, and Hart found me back-door wide open,” Criscuolo said. “It was a great play by those guys, and it was good to get a power-play goal, because we were pretty due for one.”
Just over a minute later, the two freshmen were back at it again when Criscuolo took a pass inside from Hart, attacked the net head-on, and fired a shot past Lewis to put Harvard ahead before finishing with a big fist pump.
“It was a two-on-one,” Criscuolo said. “[Marshall] Everson kind of drove his defender back and gave me a lane to shoot. I was just trying to get it on net and luckily I beat [Lewis] glove side.”
With just 24 seconds remaining in the period, Gozzo took a pass from assistant captain forward Alex Fallstrom and put Harvard up, 3-1, with the first of his two goals.
“We just wanted to get on the board and start attacking their D because we knew they could turn some pucks over,” Criscuolo said. “Once we started getting pucks to the net, we realized their goalie was having an off night.”
Clarkson outshot the Crimson, 15-3, in the second period. Traber held his ground until there was just 1:29 remaining in the frame, when, following a Crimson turnover, Simon Bessette was able to fire a shot past him to cut Harvard’s lead to one.
But Harvard put the contest away in the final frame. Senior forward Connor Morrison made it a 4-2 game at the 6:41 mark when he took a long pass from sophomore Tommy O’Regan, beat his defender, and fired a shot off the far post that deflected into the net.
Fifty-three seconds later, Gozzo was able to squeeze the puck past an out-of-position Golden Knights defense for his second score of the night. Jaw put things away with his first career tally just over a minute after that when he beat Lewis from the right point.
“In the third, we just came out and completely dominated,” Traber said.
The goaltender earned his second career win even though his team was outshot, 31-20.
“I’m definitely starting to settle down and feel more confidence,” Traber said.
“When he gets in there, he’s really positionally sound,” Criscuolo added. “When Traber needed to make saves, he really stepped up.... The coaches are starting to gain some confidence in him.”

As most of America turns its eye to Hollywood, The Back Page looks back at the year so far in Harvard sports and gives out its own Academy Awards. 
 
Best Actor:
 Freshman point guard Siyani Chambers has been a sparkplug so far this year for the men’s basketball team. Chambers leads the team in assists and is second on the team in points. He plays nearly 38 minutes a game and has been a steadying force for the team, shooting 83 percent from the line to help it close out tough games all season.
 
Best Actress:
Sophomore Amanda Sobhy helped her team complete its defense of the women’s squash national title last weekend, breezing through the tournament and dropping only one set. Sobhy has not yet lost a match while playing for the Crimson.
 
Best Supporting Actor:
On a team that did its primary damage through the air, senior running back Treavor Scales was a steadying force all year for the Harvard football team. Scales rushed for six yards per carry, scoring 13 touchdowns on the year and breaking the 1,000-yard mark on his final carry of his career—a 63-yard scamper that clinched the Crimson’s victory in The Game.
 
Best Supporting Actress:
Just a freshman, goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer has made a team-high 282 save this season, having started 15 of the the Harvard women’s ice hockey team’s 28 games. The rookie has been a shining asset on the squad, which will be the No. 3 seed in the upcoming ECAC tournament.
 
Best Director:
Tasked with integrating a slew of new and talented freshmen into the fold, men’s water polo coach Ted Minnis led his team to an unprecedented nine straight wins in mid-October and the team ended the season by making it to the Eastern Championships.
 
Best Performance (Drama):
Down 63-41 midway through the second half against the Crimson on Feb. 2, Brown forced the Harvard men’s basketball team into overtime after a furious comeback. A late Christian Webster three was not enough in the first overtime, as Brown’s Stephen Albrecht drilled one from deep with 38 seconds left to send the game into double overtime. In the second extra period, the Crimson pulled away with 11 points, finishing with an 89-82 victory.
 
Best Performance (Comedy):
The only media-winning number of the selection, the award goes to the Harvard Baseball Team and its “Call Me Maybe” Internet sensation.

All season long, the Harvard women’s track and field team has relied primarily on its throwing corps to put points on the board and keep the squad competitive. While the Crimson throwers continued to impress at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships over the weekend, it was the team’s group of sprinters who stepped up in a big way for Harvard.
Going into the final two events of the two-day competition, which was held at Gordon Indoor Track, the Crimson was clinging to a 101-100.7 lead over Cornell. In the penultimate event—the 4x800-meter relay—Harvard finished in second place and the Big Red in fifth to extend the Crimson’s lead to just over six points.
“There was a huge amount of pressure [on the relay teams],” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I think they all knew what was at stake and they just went out there and executed.”
In the final event of the championship meet—the 4x400-meter dash—Harvard’s quartet of freshmen Autumne Franklin and Christi Scott, sophomore Gabrielle Scott, and junior Olivia Abbate needed to finish in fourth place or better to secure the team title.
“I was anchor leg so I felt a lot of pressure,” Franklin said. “Especially because the score was so close, I felt like it was all on me.”
Though Cornell topped the Harvard foursome in the relay, Franklin crossed the finish line in second place to earn her team the conference crown.
“[After the race] people were crying, people were running up to me and giving me hugs, and picking me up off my feet,” Franklin said. “Everyone was so excited about the win. There’s been so much energy, it’s been wonderful.”
Including the eight points from the 4x400, 59 of the team’s 117 total points came in sprinting events, as the Crimson edged the Big Red by a final tally of 117-112.7 to win the Ivy League Championship for the first time since 2000. On the men’s side, Harvard recorded 86 team points, which was good for third place behind Cornell and Princeton.
“It was awesome,” Saretsky said. “That’s the best word I can use to describe it. We came into the meet with an outside chance to win it, and we had a number of people really step up and have some amazing performances out there. I just couldn’t be prouder of our women’s team.”
The weekend began in record-setting fashion for the Harvard women. Coming off a dominant performance at the HYP meet two weeks ago, junior co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu cruised to a victory in the weight throw. Though the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, scratched on her first two throws, her final toss of 20.83 meters broke the Ancient Eight record that she set at HYP. Ekechukwu’s closest competitor, Princeton freshman Julia Ratcliffe, who set the conference record at the beginning of the season, was two full meters short of the record-breaking heave.
Ekechukwu was named the women’s MVP of the meet, a distinction that was earned on the men’s side by senior Nico Weiler for his performance in the pole vault. Weiler, who finished in fourth place at last year’s outdoor NCAA Championships, won the event with a clearance of 5.38 meters. None of the event’s other participants cleared a height greater than 4.70 meters.
“[Ekechukwu and Weiler] put in so much hard work and are clearly very talented as well,” Saretsky said. “They’re just national-caliber athletes.”
Weiler’s victory gave the Crimson 10 team points, a figure that was doubled by a trio of throwers in the shot put. Junior Dustin Brode, sophomore Ben Glauser, and senior Edward Brucker finished in first, third, and fourth place, respectively, in the event.
On the women’s side, Harvard notched 18 points in the 60-meter hurdles, as Franklin and classmate Martina Salander took the top two spots in the event.
“I couldn’t have asked for anything more in my race,” Franklin said. “I think I was just very focused…. Also, with the energy of the meet, I felt like I was just absorbing all of the hype.”
Franklin crossed the finish line in a blistering 8.43 seconds, besting the Heps record by 0.01 seconds. Salander was just behind her classmate, coming in at 8.57 seconds.
“For our women to go out there and come away with the victory on our home track was a really, really special moment,” Saretsky said. “We’re hoping this is the first of many.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite having the match of his career on Saturday, junior Gary Power wasn’t powerful enough to lead the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team to a national championship.
After dropping his first two games in the semifinal against No. 2 Princeton, Power came back to sweep the next three and propel the Crimson into the final round.
It wasn’t enough.
Twenty-four hours later, the Crimson fell to Trinity for the second time this season in New Haven as Power dropped his second close match in two days.
In Harvard’s first appearance in the final round of the Potter Cup since its second place finish in 2004-2005, the Crimson couldn’t hold on against an undefeated Bantams squad. Trinity won its 14th championship in 15 years, after being unseated last year for the first time in 13 years by Princeton.
Finishing the season with a 17-3 record, the Crimson will look to make another run at the title next season and win its first championship since 1998.
“[I have] mixed feelings,” junior Ali Farag said. “I think the whole season we had the goal of winning and also we persevered and the final went either way. This will make us nothing but stronger and harder to beat next year.”
TRINITY 6, HARVARD 3
Despite jumping out to a lead against the Bantams, the Crimson dropped contests in the fourth through eighth slots and left defeated.
“Trinity is a lot better prepared than any other team,” Farag said. “They took the title home, but they were more lucky and determined today. I think it could have gone either way, but we couldn’t get the two matches that we need.”
Farag swept his match, 3-0, in the top spot and held Bantam junior Reinhold Hergeth to five points or less in each game. Harvard also saw victories from No. 3 junior Nigel Koh and No. 9 senior Alexander Ma.
“It meant a lot to be trusted by my teammates and go up and represent Harvard in such an important match and by all the alums who haven’t been in that place in so long,” Ma said. “Harvard has a rich tradition in squash and as a senior I made it my goal to reward everyone for their hard work.”
Playing in the No. 4 spot, Power came back from a first game loss to take the next two against Trinity’s sophomore Karan Malik, outscoring his opponent 22-13. But the senior couldn’t keep his streak going, dropping the final two games and taking a 3-2 loss, his third of the season.
HARVARD 5, PRINCETON 4
Despite Farag losing the first match of his collegiate career, the Crimson held the Tigers at bay to win the semifinal round of the Potter Cup.
Playing in the No. 1 spot, 2011 national champion Todd Harrity handed Farag a 3-1 loss. But Harvard was able to overcome the loss and went into the final match tied up, where Power took over and beat Princeton’s Dylan Ward.
“I think I did pretty well and overall played better than last year, but I could have done better,” Farag said of his loss. “It’s good so that next time I know how to prepare better for the match and approach it in a more professional way.”
The win over Princeton was Harvard’s first of the season. A month ago, the Tigers beat the Crimson, 5-4, at home and snapped the team’s nine-game win streak.
“It’s kind of funny because last time they beat us 5-4 and we beat them 5-4,” Farag said. “The four guys who won last time are the four guys who lost. The way we approached it was much more professional and especially Gary Power putting him out there to win. That was amazing.”
HARVARD 6, ROCHESTER 3
Opening the weekend with a strong showing, Harvard came back after first round losses to defeat the Yellow Jackets and move on to the semifinals.
The Crimson won each match by at least two games and had four 3-0 sweeps.
Harvard looked to its seniors to clinch the big wins, as Power defeated his opponent in the No. 4 spot and co-captain Zeke Scherl held on for a 3-1 win in the No. 7 spot.
“We’ve got a ton of great juniors and sophomores on the team and they are definitely going to go into next year hungry for a national championship,” Ma said. “We have a ton of young talent and I think that next year we will be favorites for the national title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Friday night it looked as if the Harvard men’s hockey team (8-16-3, 5-13-2 ECAC) was going to continue a recent trend of finishing an otherwise disappointing season on a high note. St. Lawrence (16-11-4, 9-6-4) faced a Crimson team on a season-high four-game unbeaten streak.
Freshman forward Jimmy Vesey had put the Crimson up 2-1 early in third period at Appleton Arena, with assists from sophomore Colin Blackwell—his fourth in five games—and assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.
But midway through the final frame, that lead would quickly disappear.
After a tripping penalty by captain Danny Biega at 7:57 in the third, Saints senior defenseman George Hughes netted a power-play goal to tie the score at two, with helpers from captain Kyle Flanagan and junior Justin Baker.
Just 12 seconds later, junior forward Greg Carey claimed the lead for St. Lawrence, scoring what would be the game-winner off assists from junior forward Jeremy Wick and senior defenseman Jordan Dewey.
“Unfortunately the game turned around that quickly,” freshman forward Kyle Criscuolo said. “The two-goal swing kind of changed the momentum on us.”
“We battled hard, it was definitely disappointing,” added freshman goalie Peter Traber, who backed up junior netminder Raphael Girard in the game.
The crowd seemed to play a factor at Appleton Arena, which is located a few miles from the Canadian border in upstate New York.
“That rink is old; there’s not much to do at St. Lawrence,” Criscuolo said. “So they always get a good fanbase, and they got the momentum from us.”
Carey has been on fire this season, averaging a nation-high 1.47 goals per game while tallying 25 goals and 47 points, also best in the country. Complementing his scoring has been Flanagan, with 28 assists and 40 points, good for third-best and fifth-best in the nation, respectively.
With the victory, the Saints increased their winning streak to four, highlighted by an upset one week earlier against No. 1 Quinnipiac, where they handed the top-ranked Bobcats their first loss in 22 games.
Harvard remains in last place in the ECAC with this loss to second-place St. Lawrence. With two games remaining in the regular season and the Crimson three points behind Colgate, Harvard will need some help to move up and avoid its first last place finish in at least 50 years.
In the first period, the Crimson took the first lead of the game with a power-play goal from senior Marshall Everson. It marked his fifth straight game with a goal, a career-high goal streak. Biega and senior Luke Greiner were attributed with assists.
Everson, last week’s ECAC player of the week—the first such honor this season for Harvard—claimed the lead in goals for the Crimson before Vesey propelled himself back into a tie for the lead with his third-period goal. Each has 11 goals on the season, though the freshman leads the team in points with 17, along with Fallstrom and fellow freshman Brian Hart.
Biega’s assist brought his season total to seven on the season, to go with two goals. Though he has had a significant drop-off from last season’s production, in which he tallied 10 goals, 25 assists, and 35 points—including a league-high 14 on the power play—the captain was recently nominated for the 2013 Senior CLASS Award.
He is the only nominee from the ECAC and just the second from Harvard, the first since 2009, when Brian McCafferty ’09 was up for the award that is presented to NCAA Division I athletes who excel in the four areas of community, classroom, character, and competition.
11:20 into the first period, Flanagan knotted the score at one with help from junior defenseman Pat Raley and sophomore forward Justin Bruckel.
After St. Lawrence stormed back to take the lead in the third, sophomore forward Patrick Doherty added some insurance late in the game with a goal at 14:55 for the Saints, assisted by sophomore forwards Gunnar Hughes and Tommy Thompson.
Despite the loss, the Crimson outshot St. Lawrence, 26-25, and 14-7 in the third period alone. Girard had 21 saves on the night for Harvard, while Matt Weninger had 24 saves for the Saints.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score 15-13 in the Lions favor, the winner of the heavyweight bout in Harvard wrestling’s (8-5, 6-4 EIWA) match against Columbia (6-8, 3-5) would earn his team the dual-meet win at the Crimson’s final home match.
Heavyweight freshman Nick Gajdzik took the mat to battle it out against Lions’ senior Chris Manna. Heading into the second period, neither wrestler tallied a single point. The score remained 0-0 after Gajdzik held Manna pointless for the duration of the second period. In the final frame, the Harvard rookie registered a point after an escape and eventually secured a 2-0 decision, bringing the final score to 16-15 for a Crimson victory.
“[Nick] likes the spotlight, he likes the pressure, and it’s especially rare to see that in a freshman,” co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “Nick had a phenomenal match against a tough competitor.”
Harvard and Columbia battled back and forth throughout the dual meet, with the score never staying in either team’s favor for long.
In usual fashion, freshman Jeffrey Ott started off the match in the 125 pound weight class. Ott wrestled a high-scoring bout against the Lions’ Penn Gottfried but eventually topped the junior with a 14-7 decision to snag the first win for the Crimson.
“With Jeff Ott at 125, I thought he wrestled really well,” Peppelman said. “He attacked from start to finish. He wasn’t able to get the major decision, but he wrestled really hard, and I was proud of him.”
Columbia answered with a 3-2 win at 133, as junior Matt Bystol came back from a 1-0 deficit to Harvard senior Shay Warren in the final period to tie the total score.
The Crimson struck back when co-captain Steven Keith registered his 102nd career win after securing a 7-0 decision, shutting out Alec Mooradian of the Lions.
“We rattled off another win at 141 with Steven,” Peppelman said. “Steven was just shy of a major decision, and that was a big win for him.”
Freshman Todd Preston took to the mat against No. 5 Steve Santos in the 149 weight class. Preston held Santos 0-0 until Columbia’s senior managed an escape at the beginning of the second period. Santos ended up holding the 1-0 lead to snag the win and tie up the score.
“At 149, Todd Preston, one of our freshmen, he just keeps getting better,” Peppelman said. “He wrestled the No. 5 guy in the country…. I’m really proud of Todd and how far he has come.”
At 157, Peppelman wrestled his last dual-meet match against Jake O’Hara and topped him in a 3-0 decision. Many Lions on the bench contested the call, causing the official to dock one team-point from Columbia, bringing the score to 9-5 with Harvard in the lead.
The Lions responded with a 10-1 major decision in the 165 pound weight class, tying up the match once again. Columbia grabbed the lead after junior Cameron Croy fell to Stephen West when the Lions’ senior escaped Croy early on in the final frame. West held off the Harvard junior to secure the 4-3 decision.
“Cameron Croy lost a tough match to a really good competitor,” Peppelman said. “He almost had him at the end, but he wrestled hard during the whole match.”
Columbia extended its lead after registering a third consecutive win at 184, but sophomore James Fox brought the Crimson back into the match after coming out of the gates strong and dominating his opponent with an 11-2 major decision.
“Fox had to get a major, and he got a major,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said.
Gajdzik clinched the winning bout necessary to secure a Crimson dual-meet victory after beating Manna, 2-0, to bring the final score to 16-15.
“Obviously we want ten wrestlers wrestling great at this point of the year, and we’re not there yet, but we’re getting close,” Weiss said. “I thought people wrestled hard [but] we still have a lot of work to do and a short time to do it, but obviously it’s good to come away with a win…. It’s just getting guys mentally ready, keeping them fresh, getting them rested up, and hopefully wrestling their best in two weeks.”
With the regular season over, Harvard  will now prepare to compete in the 2013 EIWA Championships on the weekend of March 8th.
“I think it was a really good season for the team,” Peppelman said. “We are just focusing on fine-tuning, making sure we’re healthy, and we’re ready to go. We’ve done a lot of hard work, so now we’re just focusing on the problems we can fix and try to make a run at the national tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It doesn’t get much closer than the Harvard women’s tennis team’s (2-3) 4-3 loss to the Boston College Eagles (5-0, 1-0 ACC). Seven tiebreakers. Four third sets. Four final sets decided by tiebreakers. When matches get tight, like they did on Saturday, it can be difficult to separate an individual performance from what’s happening on the other courts.
“When the match gets close it is incredibly important that you focus on your match because you don’t want what is happening with other teammates to take away your attention,” sophomore Sylvia Li said. “You don’t want the teammate playing a match next to you to be what you are focusing on.”
After dropping the doubles point, the Crimson split the first two singles matches. Freshman Amy He scored a 6-3, 7-6 (11) victory over Boston College’s Alex Kelleher in the second spot while Li lost a pair of tiebreakers on the third line. All four singles matches went into the third set, with the Eagles pulling out three-set victories at the first and sixth lines as co-captain Hideko Tachibana and freshman Crystal Yen fell, 4-6 and 6-7 (5) in the third set, respectively.
“We always have a fun rivalry when we play Boston College,” coach Traci Green said. “The match came down to the wire and it was pretty back-and-forth the entire way through. Unfortunately it didn’t go our way. Each match was very close. We fought extremely hard and I feel like we competed at a solid level and we just came up unlucky in a couple of tiebreakers.”
Harvard continued its rotation at the doubles position, moving Tachibana and He up to the first line, where they lost in a tiebreaker, 7-8 (5). Freshman Hai-Li Kong and junior Natalie Blosser played together for the first time this year, falling, 3-8. At the third line, Li and junior Hannah Morrill scored Harvard’s lone doubles victory—capitalizing on an early break to get an 8-5 victory. Despite the loss, Tachibana said she was happy with how the team competed—a quality that will be important as it heads into Ivy League matchups.
“I’m encouraged by the strong determination of our players,” Tachibana said. “The Ivy League is looking really tough and it will come down to clinchers, and often times who wins those matches isn’t based on pure talent but who can push past their nerves and get the victory. It’s good to see that we have a lot of fighters on the team. It was great to see everyone fighting for the very last point.”
Green said that the team views its non-conference schedule as preparation for its Ivy League schedule. The Crimson will play between two and four freshman in any given match depending on the health of the team—on Saturday, co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amanda Lin were out with injuries—and Green said each match is a learning experience for the young squad.
“We think of all of our matches as part of preparation for Ivies so we want to make sure we get in coaching in each and every match, whether it is close or not close,” Green said. “You want [the freshmen] to learn to think on the run and ultimately that will make them more confident at key moments in matches.”
After winning its first match of the season, Harvard has struggled, losing three of its last four against top-tier opponents. However, after playing its last three matches against Big Six Conference schools, the Crimson gets three smaller conference schools at home over the next two weeks. The Crimson will play five of its next seven matches at home.
Green said that after the Nemo snowstorm interrupted the team’s non-conference schedule, matches the past two weekends against BC and Maryland have been key in getting the team back in form. Green said that Harvard, who has dealt with injuries all season, will be a formidable squad when healthy.
“We have a lot of heart and a lot of fire. All we have to do is put it all together and get everybody healthy and we will be a tough team to beat,” Green said. “We got snowed out with the recent blizzard and this match really helped for the freshmen. Each and every match we are growing as a team and I am looking forward to our next match this coming weekend. This team is great to work with and it’s really fun to coach this team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two weeks of inaction, the Harvard women’s water polo team returned to the pool to take on competition at the CWPA/MAAC Crossover at Villanova.
The Crimson (7-4) began its weekend on a sour note with two losses on Saturday. The first, a 10-8 defeat, came at the hands of Wagner, and the second came when Harvard fell to Iona a few hours later in a 17-14 affair.
But the team seized on the opportunity to bounce back the next day and captured two wins to end the weekend with an even slate. The Crimson offense twice tied its season-best 20 goals scored, first defeating Villanova, 20-10, and going on to beat Siena by a score of 20-6.
“It was a good weekend to get ready for conference play, which starts next weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “It was good to get back in the water and play competition. I thought we did some good things, and I think there are some things we can definitely go back and improve on.”
HARVARD 20, VILLANOVA 10
Although the Crimson defeated Villanova (0-14) decisively by 15 goals two weeks ago, Harvard did not look past its opponents the second time around as the dominant Crimson offense propelled the squad past the Wildcats.
Sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes anchored Harvard in net to match her career-high 13 saves. Co-captain Aisha Price also contributed six assists in the high-scoring affair to set a new career mark.
“I can’t take any credit for anything that I’ve done,” Price said. “I have the opportunity to play with amazing girls. It’s so fun to play with them every weekend.”
Freshman Charlotte Hendrix, who is the team’s high scorer, led the Crimson offense with six goals. Seven other Harvard players found the back of the net, including sophomore Kalina Grabb and freshman Yoshi Andersen, who both contributed three-goal performances.
The Crimson produced consistently on the offensive end all game, scoring five goals in each of the four periods of play.
Progress was also made on the defensive front, as seven Harvard players totaled at least 2 steals to combine for a team season-high of 20.
After the win over Villanova, the Crimson took on Siena (0-4) in its final game of the weekend. Harvard came out on top by a score of 20-6, once again equaling its season-high in scoring and achieving its second largest margin of victory on the year.
IONA 17, HARVARD 14
Although the Crimson held a one-goal lead after the first period, Iona (5-3) struck back in the second to outscore Harvard by two. In the second half, the two teams played back-and-forth water polo, but the Gaels managed to outpace the Crimson by two goals to capture a 17-14 win.
Harvard hung with Iona the entire game, as three of the four quarters were decided by one goal.
“Down the stretch, we didn’t convert in both games,” Minnis said. “They were tied games late in the fourth quarter, and we just couldn’t put the ball away. Both Wagner and Iona are very good teams…. Both teams have great 2-meter play, and they worked really hard on the perimeter, so it was a good test for us.”
The Crimson defense struggled throughout the contest, as the 17 goals allowed were the most the team has surrendered so far this season.
Junior Shayna Price contributed a team-high four goals and notched two assists. Aisha Price, right on her sister’s tail with three goals, also matched her own career-high six steals.
WAGNER 10, HARVARD 8
Harvard opened up the weekend against Wagner. Despite hanging with the Seahawks (7-4) for most of the game, the Crimson ultimately fell in a close one by a score of 10-8.
The two teams battled in an even second half, with each squad netting three goals. But Wagner outscored Harvard by one in each of the first two quarters, and the Crimson could not muster the necessary effort to overcome the two-goal deficit.
“We need to be a little more consistent,” Minnis said. “Once you score a goal, we need to work a little harder not to let other teams score goals.”
Harvard had trouble containing Seahawks freshman Jess Lundgren, who contributed a game-high four goals along with two assists.
Aisha Price led the way for the Crimson with three goals, two assists, and five steals, just one short of the career-high she matched in the ensuing game. Andersen also contributed a hat trick.

I learned the hard way that there is more to an interview than just answering questions; interviews are full of social norms like punctuality and shaking hands. So that others may learn from my mistakes, I have broken down some of the less obvious complexities of the standard interview.
1. Don't Apply Drunk
I find that the problem with applying drunk is not bad grammar or spelling mistakes, but rather poor judgment when it comes to qualifications and an inability to remember what you actually applied for. I discovered during one recent interview that I had applied for a pre-med program in Chile and listed as my qualifications my familiarity with WebMD and over the counter decongestants.
If worst comes to worst and you wake up one morning with a hangover and a conformation email—show up drunk to the interview. You will want to be in the same mind-set as when you applied so that you remember what you applied for; it's a psychology thing.
2. Make Sure the Interview is in English
Or that you know the language you are being interviewed in.
Turns out that when I am put on the spot I loose the ability to conjugate verbs. Why do I want to live in Chile? To learn, to live, to teach…
Another useful tip: remember nouns. The list of farm vocabulary you learn in 9th grade can only do so much for your interview—unless you want to work on "el campo," which, if anyone asks, I do.
3. Have a Question Ready
When the interviewer asks if you have any questions at the end of the interview, always say yes. Even if you don't have real questions, showing interest and the ability to create inflection in conversation is critical. If you are at a loss for questions, ask your interviewer where she bought her pantsuit, or what time it is.
In my case Qué hora es?

With the Academy Awards now over, Flyby caught up with Harvard's very own Oscar guru Ben Zauzmer '15. Zauzmer, who published data predicting the Oscar wins, used available data pertaining to the nominees to predict the likelihood they would go home with an Oscar. Zauzmer tells Flyby how the math matched up to the winning movies.
 
Flyby: How do you think the show went overall compared to your predictions?
BZ: I was delighted. Overall, the model went 17 for 21, and it called two of the big, close to call categories, Best Movie for Argo and Best Director Ang Lee, which, for many, seemed to be an upset.
[Editor's Note: Best Director was the only major category in which Zauzmer had a different prediction than that of statistics wizard Nate Silver. Zauzmer's prediction was ultimately correct.]
 
Flyby: Which of your predictions worked? Which didn't?
BZ: The ones that didn't work were the extremely close ones... those were all in single digit percentages, those were pretty much a toss up anyway. The other one was the Best Original Screenplay award. 
 
Flyby: In your own opinion, all data aside, how happy are you with this year's winners?
BZ: Outside of the data, I think that a lot of the movies for me were all middle-of-the road. I don't think there was anything that truly stood out as one of the all time greats. [But] there was nothing that won that I felt didn't truly deserve to win.
 
Flyby: What did you do for the Oscars?
BZ: Mather was generous, they gave me money and space to throw a party, and it was a great night.
