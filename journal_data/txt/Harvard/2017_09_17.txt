After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After one stellar, and two relatively good seasons (bordering on occasionally exceptional), “You’re the Worst” returned for a two-part fourth season premiere. The series is what I can only describe as a mold-breaking sitcom, as it uses the plot structure and the character structure of a sitcom (“You’re the Worst” follows four friends who occasionally sleep with each other), yet is ambitious enough to break out of the monotony that can come with shows that religiously follow standard sitcom practices.
Categorization, however, may obscure the most salient part of the show. Fundamentally, “You’re the Worst” is about how broken people interact while trying to pick up the shards of their shattered souls from the ground. It is blindingly funny as well.
The premiere picks up in the hazy aftermath of a beautifully shot Season Three finale in which Gretchen, played by the sometimes overzealous (but generally exceptional) Aya Cash, is abandoned by Jimmy (Chris Geere) immediately after his proposal. “It’s Been: Part 1” and “It’s Been: Part 2” (it’s a doubleheader season premiere) admirably do not attempt to find a neat solution to that minefield. Instead, Jimmy goes on a self-imposed exile to a trailer park retirement community and Gretchen stays indoors for three months as she crashes at the apartment of her friend (Lindsay, warmly portrayed by Kether Donohue). Gretchen also occasionally smokes crack.
The show works when it functions the way I’ve mythologized it: as a show about the brokenness of the human soul. The show doesn’t work when its characters are caricatures.
The latter is occasionally the case in “It’s Been: Part 1” and “It’s Been: Part 2.” All the actors seem to have taken the director's instructions a bit too seriously. Geere seems a bit too absurd as he destroys a neighbor’s property with an elderly friend, Burt (Raymond J. Berry), and Cash overplays the symptoms of her manic depression. Yet flickers of past greatness remain as Geere berates the same elderly friend in a bar with relaxed vigor and Cash looks subtly pained while reading a mid-coitus text message. Moreover, while the show has lost its comedic punch in the premiere, glimmers are still apparent in brief moments of priceless comedic timing from Lindsay’s boss, Priscilla (Kathleen Rose Perkins).
With that said, “You’re the Worst” maintains its elegant intelligence in some of its most cartoonish moments. Jimmy’s self-imposed exile and subsequent befriending of an older man who has a similar brand of ornery exile could easily be read as a hackneyed way of illustrating the inevitable future product of Jimmy’s isolationism. In a certain sense, it is. Yet when the parallel between Jimmy and Burt is so obvious, Jimmy’s inability to see the clarity of the connection is a revealing way of exploring the his internal blindness.
He’s not only blind to the way that he has savaged Gretchen’s life and mental stability. He is blind to what his own exile will do—and is doing—to himself. The character work is deeply compelling. Yet, that should not obscure the fact that the show has lost its comedic edge, some of its restraint in the representation of depravity, and some of its subtlety in characterization and thematics.
I do not wish to condemn the show, but I am concerned that without tighter writing, the series will fade into an obscure death. The team behind the show is—if the first season is any indication—too smart to allow that to happen. Moreover, I anticipate that as the show hits its midseason stride, and settles into the strides that “You’re the Worst” is so skilled at subverting, it will fulfill the potential it’s shown before.
It’s just not there right now. One can only hope that it will find its ornery voice once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
We write to express our deep dissatisfaction with Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government for rescinding Chelsea Manning’s invitation to serve as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics. We call on the Kennedy School to immediately reinstate Ms. Manning’s designation and to issue her a personal apology.
The withdrawal of Chelsea Manning’s fellowship is a classic case of selective outrage. Harvard has not severed its affiliation with General David Petraeus, currently a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School who was convicted for leaking classified information to his mistress while Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Another fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics, Corey Lewandowski, assaulted a reporter while managing President Donald Trump’s campaign. Chelsea Manning’s critics are not actually concerned with the law or the safety of soldiers (the Pentagon itself has admitted her leaks had no significant impact on U.S. military efforts). What they take issue with is her exposure of unchecked military violence.
Chelsea Manning has not yet been afforded the gloss of time, as have widely respected whistleblowers of the past—from Daniel Ellsberg, who exposed the secret escalation of the Vietnam War, to Mark Felt, who revealed crucial details of the Watergate scandal—but her contributions will undoubtedly be recognized in time. Ms. Manning willingly sacrificed her own liberty to expose tens of thousands of previously unrecorded deaths in Iraq, civilian slaughter so frequent as to appear routine, and the United States’ failure to investigate hundreds of reports of torture. The war logs among the documents she leaked reveal the disturbingly cavalier attitude of military personnel towards the torture and murder of those whom they purported to liberate; one now-infamous recording reveals a helicopter crew laughing at the civilians—“dead bastards”—they had just killed. Americans have a right to know the atrocities their government commits in their name, and we are all indebted to Ms. Manning for bringing these atrocities to light.
Chelsea Manning’s experiences as an incarcerated trans woman make her perspective all the more important and her exclusion all the more inexcusable. Amid pervasive and targeted torture at the hands of the United States government, Ms. Manning has relentlessly fought for justice for herself and others. Her refusal to stay silent while being kept in men’s military prisons and denied life-saving health care led to a case that set a precedent for trans-related healthcare for people in this nation’s prisons. Chelsea Manning’s groundbreaking struggle for dignity and respect sheds light on the experiences of trans prisoners throughout the U.S., and her story deserves a platform at Harvard.
In light of her selfless sacrifices as a whistleblower, her dedication to the truth, and her commitment to human rights, we call upon the Harvard Kennedy School to reinstate Chelsea Manning’s designation as a fellow at the Institute of Politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot can change in just one year.
On Sept. 16, 2016, Harvard opened at home against the University of Rhode Island and thoroughly rocked the Rams, 51-21. The Crimson’s offense clicked from the kickoff, finding the end zone three times in the first quarter alone, and the Harvard defense held URI to just seven points through the first three quarters.
On the same date in 2017, the Crimson grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first quarter, but it was evident from the start that Harvard would not walk away with another easy win. The rest of the way, the Rams established both their offensive attack and defensive prowess, ultimately dispatching the Crimson, 17-10, in Kingston, R.I.
“You never want to start a season with a loss,” captain Luke Hutton said. But again, the only way to improve, at least the only way I know, is just to work harder, and that’s got to be the message that we have for this week coming up against Brown. It’s got to be water under the bridge.”
However, the most concerning loss of the day may have happened in the second quarter. URI quarterback Tyler Harris found receiver Marven Beauvais for 18 yards down the sideline, and freshman cornerback Ben Abercrombie knocked Beauvais out of bounds as he came down with the football. However, Abercrombie remained on the ground and was carted off with a neck injury.
Unlike last year, this game was not decided until the play clock expired. Coming out of a timeout, Harvard found itself on URI’s 25 with just seven seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano handled the snap, catching it calmly with one hand. The veteran lofted a ball toward the end zone, but he overthrew his intended target. The Rams stormed the field as the ball skipped off the turf, celebrating the team’s fifth win in four years.
The Crimson’s last-ditch effort to even the score followed sloppy play on both ends. At a time when both squads desperately needed ball control—Harvard to set up a scoring drive and URI to preserve the lead—the teams fumbled on back-to-back possessions.
A long drive went off the rails when the Crimson attempted to convert on fourth down at the Rams’ seven-yard line.  Viviano set up a handoff to junior running back Charlie Booker III, but Rams lineman Jose Duncan broke up the play. As Viviano and Booker collided, the ball squirted loose. Sophomore defensive back Momodou Mbye recovered, and Harvard’s 76-yard push was all for naught.
“I saw an opening and jetted straight to the [quarterback],” Duncan said. “I knocked the running back into the quarterback, and the quarterback fumbled. That was critical for our defense. When we need a play on defense, someone needs to make a play.”
Just as it appeared the Crimson was circling the drain, the visitors rose up. With just under three minutes left on the clock, URI running back T.J. Anderson fumbled in Harvard territory, and senior safety Tanner Lee swooped in for the loose ball. However, the Crimson ultimately could not capitalize, as Viviano’s final heave sailed long.
Harvard appeared to have the upper hand in the early going. Booker bowled his way through the secondary twice, recording runs of 50 and 57 yards. Overall, the junior set a career high in yardage with 139 yards on 13 carries.
“The kid ran pretty well, and he ran hard,” Rams coach Jim Fleming said. “He broke some tackles. We looked atrocious on the explosive runs, which really had no purpose getting where they got to. More power to him—he made some plays. But our kids and coaches did a good job adjusting at halftime.”
On the afternoon, Viviano did not rely on a single target. Junior wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley recorded the most catches (five), and Viviano targeted seven different players.
The offense took a while to integrate Shelton-Mosley and junior teammate Adam Scott, who led the receiving corps last year. The duo combined for just 13 yards on two catches in the first half, as Crimson coach Tim Murphy opted for a run-heavy focus.
Last year, Viviano’s legs allowed him to escape pressure and either scramble for gains or throw on the run. However, URI largely confined the quarterback to the pocket, negating much of his running and passing strategy. A leaky offensive line deserved some blame. Viviano was sacked five times, and he failed to break free for any of his patented scrambles. The fifth-year signal caller finished with -19 yards on nine attempts.
As opposed to Harvard’s varied use of its offense, Fleming generally stuck to his main weapons. Harris targeted sophomore Aaron Parker (three catches, 103 yards) for considerable yardage after the wideout had snuck behind the Crimson secondary. Harold Cooper anchored the run game for URI, taking the ball 18 times for 80 yards.
“Well that’s been their MO,” said Murphy of URI’s penchant for the deep ball. “They hit three long ones against Central Michigan. We know they had big strike capability against some really fast, athletic kids. They executed very well on those plays.”
Early on, the Rams offense outplayed the Harvard defense, and in the second half URI’s defense shone through. Neither team scored in the final two quarters. In the final period alone, the Crimson drove for 144 yards without recording points.
For the Harvard offense, the fourth quarter included a full-extension snag by Shelton-Mosley and clutch conversions by senior halfback Ryan Antonellis and sophomore tight end John Stivers. However, the quarter also included a fumble and costly penalties.
Through the opening two quarters, the Crimson converted only one of five third-down opportunities. The Rams also racked up 13 first downs to Harvard’s five en route to a 17-10 lead at halftime. On URI’s final scoring drive, Harris dove over the pile for a one-yard touchdown. The hosts never relinquished this lead.
For Harvard, penalties prevented the Crimson from launching long drives. Harvard’s 10 flags included a number of holding calls in key moments.
“We can’t hold, we can’t pass interfere, we can’t have procedure calls, and we can’t have any late hits,” Murphy said. “Those are things we can control, and we obviously didn’t control them as well as we should’ve.”
Early in the afternoon, the Rams beat the Crimson to the end zone, taking a 7-3 lead in the second quarter. Harris tossed a slant-and-go to Parker, who jogged in for the score.
The Crimson’s first touchdown, meanwhile, resulted from two well-executed run plays. Booker took a handoff at Harvard’s own 35 and slammed through a pair of defenders, eventually falling out of bounds after gaining 57 yards. On the next play, rookie back Aaron Shampklin faked up the middle, cut right, and broke the plane to tie the game at 10.
