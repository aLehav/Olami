After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the death of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, newly-crowned King Salman leads a nation important for its oil, geopolitical clout, and central position in Islam. Yet the Kingdom is also noted for its authoritarian rule, harsh legal system, and often brutal treatment of women, religious minorities, and LGBTQ individuals. We hope that this shift in leadership will herald advances for human rights in Saudi Arabia, and that the United States will more consistently advocate such advances in crafting its policy toward the Kingdom.
Saudi Arabia has been a strategic partner to the United States throughout and even before King Abdullah’s rule. According to the White House, the Kingdom is the largest customer of “Foreign Military Sales” and is crucial to counter-terrorism efforts, while also constituting a major trade partner.
But it is both noteworthy and disappointing that the White House’s fact sheet on Saudi Arabia neglects even a passing mention of human rights, despite the countless violations thereof in the country reported by Human Rights Watch. Neither freedom of speech nor that of religion is respected—rather, advocates of reform face “lengthy” jail sentences. The justice system is among the world’s harshest, with dismemberment and even beheading commonly serving as punishment for non-violent offenses. Among other so-called offenses, blasphemy, apostasy, and homosexuality can all carry death sentences. The Kingdom remains the world’s only country in which women cannot legally drive. And some commentators believe that the Kingdom has either directly or indirectly contributed to the religious extremism that manifests in groups like the Islamic State.
There is some hope that Saudi Arabia could change course on its abysmal human rights record in the future. Although King Salman, who is 79, seems unlikely to make liberalization a priority, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, who is 55 and has been named deputy crown prince, was educated in the United States and is seen as a possible advocate for liberalization on education and women’s rights. Though such claims are still largely conjecture, we nonetheless hope they are right.
The United States should not continue to benefit from the support of regimes that stand counter to the ideals we claim to defend and embody. In Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, our government consistently cited its goal of liberating people from autocratic rule. But even as the president prods India on human rights, he does not seem to question Saudi Arabia’s record enough to alter its relationship with the US. Despite First L. Lady Michelle Obama’s attempt to take such a stand in refusing to wear a headscarf in a country where such behavior is banned, that act served only to highlight her right to do so without fear of repercussions—a right that Saudi women lack because of the regime our nation supports.
If the United States truly seeks to defend and uphold freedom, democracy, and basic human rights to peoples throughout the world, then this nation cannot continue to support a regime that executes dissidents and marginalizes half its population, no matter how much oil or military aid that regime may provide. As King Salman ascends to the throne, we hope that Saudi citizens will soon enjoy the human rights they are due.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They blew smoke in our faces. A row of black-clad demigods puffing cigarettes and T.S. Eliot references. The undergraduate magazine’s open house was a scene staged to intimidate. For me, whose public school poetry library consisted of three battered copies of Whitman, the message felt clear: You cannot make it here.
That was three years ago. In the intervening time, my peers have worked like crazy to alter what many of us—especially members from public secondary schools, members of color, and members from middle or working class families—felt to be a hostile space. I know we’re not the only group on campus to have to address these kinds of issues. And I know we've got a lot more to do. So as a new semester begins and many of us gear up for another comp process—another competitive, months-long audition for membership to campus extracurricular organizations—I want us to all make one promise: Don’t be a dick.
Most of us don’t come into this school wanting to be dicks. Most of us, personally, are not dicks. But I think a lot of undergraduate social life here is structured around institutional, well, dickishness. Comp processes can embody this. At their best, comps are for learning: Comp Crimson multimedia, and you get a crash course in photography. Comp WHRB and you’re basically Terry Gross. But too often, we confuse the normal pain of learning processes with social and political pain that we impose: Smoke-blowing. Throne-sitting. Social politicking that relies on elite racial, class, or gender norms. Demands of deference to an organizational ethos.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between these two types of pain. And sometimes, it’s easy to say well, hey, maybe a certain amount of intimidation is necessary to group formation.
Here’s the thing: The way we structure community here doesn’t just affect us in this place, at this moment. It affects the kinds of powerful, scarily driven, sleep-deprived, sometimes demagogic people we as an institution are putting out into the world. That’s a big ethical question. And our current answer suffers from a serious collective dearth of creativity. We think we’re people with big ideas. But if we can’t imagine models of community that don’t involve intimidation, how on earth are we going to write novels, reform healthcare, make more just economic systems? If we’re dicks here, how are we going to keep from being even bigger dicks out in the world?
This is a love letter to the labor—and it is labor, a long, slow slog—of creating spaces that welcome and empower, not intimidate and coerce. Of spaces that relentlessly address the way social power affects our daily lives. Because open spaces enable people to think better, to love freer, to do their work. Because when we don't do this, we lose people.
We lose people who are most vulnerable to social injustice in the world at large: to racism, sexism, class inequality, homo- or transphobia. We lose people who don’t or won’t or can’t play the game. We lose some of the most unruly people, the gutsiest, the most critical, people with things to say. That’s creativity we can’t afford to lose. Not as a community. Not as a world.
Here’s a challenge: This semester, design your comp for the most vulnerable person in the room. For the nervous freshman who really needs a community, or to the poet whose secondary school didn’t have poetry books. Design your comp for you at your most anxious. Design your comp for your younger self. And I don’t mean “dumb it down.” I don’t mean “lower your standards.” I mean cut the bullshit that makes people feel like they’re less valuable because of who they are, where they come from, or because they are younger, less organizationally powerful, or on the “outside.”
Ask yourself: Does your comp require students to choose between a part time job, school work, and joining your organization? Do you offer financial aid? Do you say racist things or make cultural assumptions? Do you assume everyone is cisgender or heterosexual? Do you make sexual “jokes” to and about compers? Do you account for differences in secondary school preparation? Do you require compers to make shows of obeisance to the organization?
It’s my senior spring. I’ve got a lot of thesis to write, a lot of cuties to mack with, and a lot of Zumba moves to break out at First Chance dance. But sometimes, I’m still anxious about this place: socially anxious, class anxious, anxious about winter sidewalks and smoke-filled rooms, frigid days when you slip on ice you didn’t even know was there and feel like everyone’s laughing at you.
Some of this angst naturally goes along with being 22 and a fan of Lena Dunham. But we can change a lot of it.
Because I’ve got another feeling about Harvard. It surged through my belly on the Megabus coming up I-95, at that moment when we crested Cambridge. Anxiety, yeah. But also a feeling of possibility. Like maybe this is a place where we can imagine different worlds. Where we can make them. And that felt like a kind of homecoming. The Charles River spread beneath the highway. The glimmer of Lowell bell tower standing on its tip toes, its blue a concentrated slice of sky.

No one likes traffic. So folks in the Greater Boston area were understandably upset when 29 protesters affiliated with the Black Lives Matters movement sat down in the middle of I-93 and stopped traffic for a few hours on January 15.
Denunciations were swift and severe. Massachusetts State Police Colonel Timothy Alben gave a relatively irate press conference, and two state legislators proposed bills to stiffen penalties for blocking highways.
The protesters, of course, had their own view. They pointed out that disrupting traffic is a time-honored protest tactic, and that the inconvenience of a longer morning commute is less permanent than losing a family member to police violence. In response to the news that the protests had caused an ambulance to be diverted, protest organizers noted that ambulances are often impeded by traffic.
But most of all, the protesters argued that only a disruption like the one they caused on I-93 could make people realize the plight of communities that the criminal justice system has failed. In making this argument, they cited a March 1968 speech delivered by Martin Luther King, Jr., shortly before his assassination. The portion quoted by the organizers read as follows:
“Why do we do it this way? We do it this way because it is our experience that the nation doesn’t move around questions of genuine equality for the poor and for black people until it is confronted massively, dramatically in terms of direct action.”
King gave this sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. as he prepared to launch the Poor People’s Campaign, a movement that aimed, in King’s words, “to demand that the government address itself to the problem of poverty.” King died before the Campaign’s planned march on Washington, but his role in its inception was the key, late stage in his life during which he fought against more intractable economic injustices in the urban North as well as the South.
The germs of the Poor People’s Campaign are visible in some of King’s earlier writings on riots in predominantly black areas of American cities. In 1967, he wrote a pamphlet called “The Crisis in America’s Cities,” in which he argued for a comprehensive national policy to provide good jobs and education in urban communities, and for non-violent civil disobedience as the best way to achieve that goal.
But in both his speech at the National Cathedral and his earlier work, King suggested that civil disobedience had to be calculated, organized, and massive. In 1968, he described the Poor People’s Campaign not as a “histrionic gesture,” but as a way of confronting the American people with the self-evident injustices wrought by their history.
More relevantly, he wrote in 1967 that civil disobedience was “too often…employed incorrectly. It was resorted to only when there was an absence of mass support and its purpose was headline-hunting.” In other words, effective “direct action” for King involved an organized community with a long-term strategy, with tactics meant to effect change, not merely garner attention of any variety.
Seen in this light, the I-93 protests fell far too close to a “headline-hunting,” “histrionic gesture.” While undoubtedly well intentioned, they had the immediate effect of generating negative publicity for the cause, and not much in the way of engagement with the issue of institutionalized racism.
That result is a shame, because the Black Lives Movement has generated crucial momentum towards reforming the way low-income communities and communities of color interact with the government. One website for the movement has a page of broad policy suggestions for criminal justice reform, and protest actions that increase the visibility of those ideas are crucial to their eventual implementation.
Unfortunately, the main policy discussions that arose from the I-93 protest were the draconian proposals of two state legislators to make the penalties for protesting on the highway more severe. This response was absurd, but it certainly reflected the public mood. Instead of feeling confronted with the injustices of society, commuters felt annoyed, angry, and worst of all, confused.
This confusion represents the real failure of this protest. The title of the Martin Luther King, Jr., sermon quoted by the protestors is “Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,” and King’s main thesis was that Americans had to engage with the human rights revolutions occurring in the mid 20th century, not ignore or resist it. The sermon is more than an admonishment; it is the call of an evangelist to a people that has yet to see the light.
The protesters on I-93 were too admonishing, too small, and too disconnected from the affected communities to have the desired effect, and indeed may have alienated potential supporters. The idea of King’s Poor People’s Campaign on the other hand, was that organized mass disruption, spearheaded by the communities themselves, and with a clear relation to their goals, would force the wider public to address society’s most pressing injustices.
As King wrote in 1967, that kind of organizing is difficult. But as he knew so well, it is the best way to bring about real change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor will join the Institute of Politics this April as a visiting fellow, the Institute announced on Thursday.
Cantor, a Republican, served as the representative for Virginia’s 7th congressional district from 2001 until losing in a surprising primary upset in June to Randolph–Macon College economics professor David Brat. Cantor currently serves as vice chairman and managing director at Moelis & Company, an investment bank with headquarters in New York.
Visiting fellows are selected by invitation and generally spend a few days on campus, said Eric R. Andersen, director of the Fellows and Study Groups Program at the IOP. Andersen said that Cantor will host “individualized meetings... with student groups” arranged by the Institute.
Cantor has previously appeared at the IOP as a study group guest and as a speaker at two John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum events, both of which were met by student protests.
Andersen pointed to Cantor’s experience and vision for the future as two qualities he will bring to campus.
“[Cantor] rose quickly and was always recognized as a leader of the Republican Party, both in its present form and its future, and I still believe he has that voice,” Andersen said.
Political satirist Bassem Youssef will also come to campus as a resident fellow, joining former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley and four others named earlier this month. Andersen said that the announcement of Cantor and Youssef’s fellowships came later due to logistical and scheduling issues. Resident fellows are selected through a formal application process and spend the semester at Harvard, leading regular study groups.
Andersen highlighted the “enormous amount of [student] interest” in Youssef’s work and his unique background as reasons for his selection.
“Political satire is not something that we often feature at the Institute but the way that his show affected politics and democracy in that region is really remarkable,” Andersen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2015, at 10:51 p.m.
Comedian Amy Poehler was honored in a lavish celebration Thursday as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Woman of the Year. After a parade and comedy roast, Poehler, the star of NBC’s sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” discussed the irony of receiving an honor at a university that she had long considered elitist.
The light-hearted barbs traded between Poehler and the Pudding emcees—President Jason S.  Hellerstein ’15 and Vice President Sam B. Clark ’15—at first focused on Poehler’s acting career.
“Our Woman of the Year believes that if she collects enough Emmy nominations, she might actually win one,” Hellerstein joked.
“I’d like to thank the Hasty Pudding for reminding us how hard it is to write funny jokes,” Poehler responded.
That exchange was quickly followed by commentary from Poehler, the daughter of a “blue-collar family” from Boston, on her old disdain for Harvard.
“As I drove by and gave the middle finger to [Harvard], I would’ve never known that this place would end up giving me so much shit,” Poehler, who was also a Class Day speaker in 2011, said of her teenage self.
Pointing to the all-male composition of the Pudding cast, Poehler joked that her youthful perception of Harvard as an elitist institution was not completely unfounded.
“I haven’t seen so many smiling white faces since I took my top off at a mime convention!” she exclaimed.
Preceding the roast, Poehler was escorted in a Bentley automobile from the Inn at Harvard to Farkas Hall by a parade that included Pudding cast members dressed in blond wigs and drag and police. Alongside a Duck Boat and three food trucks offering free samples, a large crowd of students made the slow walk down Massachusetts Ave.
“It was great, I love Amy Poehler,” Harry T. Newman-Plotnick ’18 said.
Other students also commented on the frenzied crowd surrounding the food trucks and the difficulty of getting a photo with Poehler.
“People kept trying to get in my selfie,” Gabbi C. Merz ’18 said.
At the end of the ceremony, Poehler held a press conference during which she described Boston as a rough city and traced her sense of humor back to her childhood there.
She also discussed her recent memoir, "Yes Please," and offered advice to those seeking to achieve their dreams.
“Every day your small actions mean something. You do this repetitive stuff every day and you wonder if it really makes a difference—but I’m here to say that it does,” Poehler said.

Harvard Art Museums Director Thomas W. Lentz will step down from his position at the head of the institution on July 1, he announced Thursday, almost three months after the reopening of the Museums.
Appointed the Elizabeth and John Moors Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums in 2003, Lentz oversaw the six-year-long renovation and integration of three of the University’s art museums, the Fogg Art Museum, the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum.
The redeveloped 204,000 square-foot facility includes an expanded gallery space, public meeting areas, a cafe and gift shop, and a 300-person lecture hall in addition to rooms for teaching and research.
Lentz will remain director of the museums until July 1. In the interim, the Office of the Provost will conduct a search for Lentz’ successor.
Deborah Martin Kao, chief curator of the Harvard Art Museums, anticipated that the search will be extremely thorough and international in scope.
“[Lentz] did what no other director had been successful in doing, not only dealing with major infrastructure issues the museums were facing but also realigning the mission of the museum to the academic goals of the University,” Kao said, citing his “wonderful management style.”
“He took on a complete rethink of what the museum should be in the 21st century and created a roadmap of what the building should be,” Kao added.
While Lentz wrote in a statement that he will be taking time off after he steps down, he has not officially announced what he will be doing afterwards.
“The museums have been taken apart and put back together again to create a new kind of teaching facility that is already realizing its potential, so in large part our goal has been accomplished,” Lentz wrote.
“The future path for this institution is virtually limitless,” he wrote. “I came to Harvard thinking much of my work would be centered on infrastructure issues at our historic building at 32 Quincy Street. While that did occur, what we really pursued was something quite different: a complete re-imagining of our institution and its re-alignment with the academic mission of Harvard University.”
Prior to working at Harvard, Lentz worked at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where he was the director of international art museums. He received a doctorate in fine arts from Harvard in 1985.
“[Lentz came to Harvard] with the intent to move forward on a renovation of the Harvard Art Museum facility, and that’s ultimately what he did,” Lauren M. Marshall, associate director of communications at the Harvard Art Museums, said.
“He and the Museum led a strategic planning process not just about the museum itself, but to see how it could fit into Harvard’s academic mission and the community,” she added.
Jane Pickering, executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, described Lentz as an “incredible” supporter, friend and colleague.
“We’ll be benefitting from his work for many, many decades,” Pickering added.

Starting next semester, students will not need to print out their course study cards or solicit written signatures from their advisers to complete course registration, as they will Friday, because the process will take place entirely online.
By the summer, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office will implement a new student information system that will make the process for completing study cards, obtaining required signatures from advisers and professors, and submitting add/drop course forms electronic.
“It’s really kind of a minor logistical difference,” FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said. “The difference is you won’t have to print out the paper, and the hope is that students and the advisers will have a better user experience.”
For years both faculty members and students have requested a paper-free system for course enrollment, and the project was formally launched a year and a half ago, according to Burke and Jason Shaffner, managing director for student information systems. Faculty members wanted to make sure that the electronic process would not allow students to enroll in courses unsuited to their academic backgrounds or needs, Burke said.
“The reason why it’s been on paper is to ensure that there’s a good advising conversation,” Burke said. “Electronically we can still ensure that happens” because faculty members can still approve which students are admitted to their courses under the new system, he said.
A software platform called Campus Solutions will organize the electronic course enrollment information. According to Burke, Campus Solutions is used at about 1,200 higher education institutions but has been tweaked specifically for use at Harvard.
“We have been developing a new interface that’s been designed with student, faculty, and adviser input,” he said. “It’s our own design and it’s based on Harvard’s needs.”
The course selection and Pre-Term Planning tools, among other information currently housed on the my.harvard.edu website, must be adapted to fit the Campus Solutions system, according to Shaffner.
“The goal is really for everything that’s on my.harvard today to find a home on the new portal,” Shaffer said.
In the next three weeks, students will be able to try out the site by signing up to participate in focus groups. Shaffner and his team will also share informational and promotional material about the site.
According to Shaffner, in addition to its use at FAS, the Campus Solutions site will launch this summer at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Divinity School. In 2016, the Kennedy School of Government, the Graduate School of Design, Harvard Medical School, the Dental School, and the School of Public Health also will use the site.

For Harvard's engineering students pursuing employment in their fields upon graduation, there are fewer University-offered recruiting services compared to those provided by more technical institutions, according to Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career Services.
Unlike Harvard, which has an On-Campus Interview Program for undergraduates that predominantly features opportunities in finance and consulting, MIT has a slew of internship programs catered specifically to those interested in mechanical, electrical, biomedical, and environmental engineering, among other engineering fields.
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  “would really benefit from having an internship coordinator or a funded internship program,” Mount said.
The University aims to build upon its programming in this area, according to Anthony J. Arcieri, the director of undergraduate career advising and programming for the College and SEAS.
This past November, Harvard co-hosted with neighboring institutions an “Engineering Boutique Night” that showcased several engineering companies. In addition, engineering students can participate in career fairs jointly held with MIT as well as participate in MIT’s equivalent of the On-Campus Interview program.
While having fewer structured recruiting resources can make the search for internships and employment more difficult, some engineering undergraduates said that they struggled to land positions over their counterparts from other institutions because engineering recruiters are less interested in Harvard students.
“Coming from the Harvard engineering program, you are not as competitive as someone from CalTech or MIT, so a lot of larger companies don’t recruit here,” said Mateusz J. Kulesza ’15, an electrical engineering concentrator who will be working at an intellectual property law firm.
“Companies are not aware that there are a lot of good engineers at Harvard,” said Nikhil Mehandru ’15, an electrical engineering concentrator. “I think that’s the main problem. When you think of Harvard, you don’t think of engineers.”
But Mount said many recruiters do not travel to Harvard to interview because of a relatively low number of interested students. She pointed to Harvard’s liberal arts model, which she said prepares “thought leaders in the field.” As a result, Harvard’s engineering students might pursue non-engineering opportunities through OCS, she said.
With a liberal arts focus, Harvard’s engineering program provides less hands-on training for its engineering students compared to other top engineering programs, Mount said. In addition, there are fewer on-campus recruiting opportunities in the engineering field because large companies have fewer entry-level engineering positions, according to Mount.
But as SEAS continues to grow in funding and scope, students said they are confident that more opportunities will be available for those aspiring to become engineers.
“When I hear of the new initiatives, I wish I came here a few years later when the department will be more mature,” Kulesza said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week’s blizzard did not deter undergraduates from braving the cold to attend classes during the spring semester’s shortened shopping week. Courses across disciplines attracted unanticipated numbers of students, who packed into classrooms and spilled into the hallways in an attempt to see lectures.
Religion 57: “Faith and Authenticity: Religion, Existentialism, and the Human Condition,” enrolled 14 students when it last was offered in fall 2013, while more than 100 students crowded into Harvard Hall to shop the course on Monday.
Students also packed in Tozzer Library 203, where they filled up desks and the floor and lined up in the hallway, for Anthropology 1682: “Gangsters and Troublesome Populations,” taught by assistant African and African American and Anthropology professor Laurence A. Ralph, who said he was not expecting the number of students who showed up on Monday and Wednesday to attend the lecture.
Another course, Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation,” may move to a larger space because the scheduled classroom could not house the students who attended.
Over the years, shopping week has been marked by scheduling mistakes and overcrowding not predicted by Pre-Term Planning enrollment projections. The computer-generated data, however, does not take into account external factors, such as when students tell their friends about exciting courses to shop, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke.
“It’s kind of the price we pay for shopping,” Burke said. “In a way, there’s a bit of uncertainty built into the first week of the semester.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that PTP data is “one set among many,” including historical data, that administrators use to predict course enrollment.
Although the blizzard prompted Harvard to cancel one day of shopping period, study cards are still due Friday afternoon, although they will not be charged the usual late fee if they miss the deadline. Harris emphasized that students should turn their cards in on time barring exceptional circumstances.

UPDATED: February 6, 2015, at 4:38 a.m.
Despite severe weather conditions, many stores and restaurants in Harvard Square did better-than-average business on Monday as customers weathered the blizzard. While many Cambridge institutions were closed due to the snow—including the University—the businesses in the Square that stayed open were not disappointed, owners and managers said.
“Monday was insanely busy,” said Bill Mahoney, manager of the 24-hour CVS on Massachusetts Ave. “Tuesday was a little slower, but we were still open.”
“Most of the purchases were food—snacks and drinks mostly,” said Mahoney.
An employee at C’est Bon Market and Liquors, Dee Sarkis, also noted heavy business on Monday as the storm ramped up.
The worsening conditions did not prevent customers in the Square from eating out at local restaurants. Felipe’s Taqueria saw a large surge in customers Monday evening, according to the owner Tom Brush.
“Business was non-stop,” Brush said. “We had a full line from 6 p.m. until midnight. We were like a beacon; it was great.”
But not all businesses experienced the same level of activity. Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, who runs two businesses in the area, wrote in an email that the storm negatively impacted productivity.
“One of my businesses lost a day of business and this will impact our bottom line for the month. Yet, it was necessarily a less productive day. The economic cost [to businesses] due to inclement weather is a well studied topic,” Mazen wrote.
In the wake of the news of Tuesday’s class cancellations, Harvard undergrads were among the patrons taking advantage of the open businesses.
“I went to Broadway Market around 8 p.m. to get some food because, surprisingly, it was still open,” Divya V. Shah ’15 said.
Both the University and Harvard Square businesses opened for business as usual on Wednesday after winter storm “Juno” had deposited over two feet of snow on the area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s forthcoming student-faculty judiciary body will likely adjudicate cheating cases with the same burden of proof currently employed by the Administrative Board and similarly hand down the same disciplinary sanctions, such as a requirement to temporarily withdraw from Harvard, according to Interim Ad Board Secretary Brett Flehinger.
The Ad Board currently determines guilt in cases against a “sufficiently persuaded” standard of proof.
The Honor Council is scheduled to begin hearing academic integrity cases next fall at the same time as the College's first honor code is implemented. According to Interim Ad Board Secretary Brett Flehinger, the Council will be composed of 12 undergraduates and another 12 members selected from a pool of faculty, former or current teaching fellows, and resident or House deans.
Representatives from the Dean of the College’s office, the Office of Undergraduate Education, and the Academic Integrity Committee are currently in the process of selecting sophomores and juniors to serve on the Honor Council next year. According to John T. Hamilton, a member of the Faculty Council, the group met Wednesday to discuss the honor code’s still-unfinalized affirmation of integrity statement, a point of contention among some professors.
More than 200 sophomores and juniors were nominated to serve on the Council last fall, and about 70 of them formally applied for a position, according to Flehinger. Administrators and students are now completing interviews of about 40 students and plan to notify successful applicants of their selections in February, he added.
Current freshmen may apply to serve on the body in February. The Dean of the College’s Office will select the other half of the Council that will include faculty, TFs, and administrators, according to Flehinger. Administrators expect to name the entire Council’s membership in early March.
Shortly thereafter, selected students will begin two hours of weekly training, according to Michael C. Ranen, a freshman resident dean for Ivy Yard and a member of the Academic Integrity Committee. That training will feature mock cases on a variety of academic integrity issues and sessions on cognitive biases and decision making led by faculty members, according to Flehinger.
While this spring will be fully dedicated to training future Council members, Flehinger said members will spend about a quarter of their time training and the other three quarters hearing cases next year. In future years, the entire application process for undergraduates will take place in the spring.
Although in many respects the Honor Council will operate similarly to the Ad Board—both with respect to its burden of proof and sanctions—Flehinger said the Council would “like to make intermediate sanctions more engaging.” Additionally, while the Ad Board breaks into small subcommittees to interview accused students, the Honor Council will likely break up into larger groups to meet with students, Ranen said.
How often students must sign a statement affirming their commitment to the honor code, a requirement that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences must still approve, remains unclear.
"We will vote on it, but we have not arrived yet at the manner of implementation,“ Hamilton said.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana called the effective implementation of the honor code one of his “most important goals” for the coming semester.
In their joint interview with The Crimson, Khurana and Flehinger were accompanied by FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the rest of the college basketball world, this weekend presents merely the latest edition of quotidian regular season matchups. Nonetheless, for the Harvard men’s basketball team (11-5, 1-1), Friday night will mark the unofficial commencement of its 14-game Ancient Eight “playoff”.
Though the Crimson has already split games against league opponent Dartmouth, now comes the true test: playing consecutive contests at Princeton (8-9, 1-0) and Penn (5-10, 0-1).
“This swing has always been a nightmare for anyone in our Conference.” Head Coach Tommy Amaker said. “Both teams play at historic venues on their home courts.”
The Ivy League is defined by its unique schedule, which calls for teams to play back-to-back conference games, in a format that sends the school with the best record to the NCAA tournament without its own playoffs.
While many expected Harvard, ranked No. 25 in the Associated Press preseason poll, to be undefeated in conference play heading into this weekend, the Crimson squandered a 14-point lead, as Dartmouth rattled off a 26-2 run in the upset at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We have to be ready to compete every night.” senior guard Wesley Saunders said. “Now we know how hard teams are going to come out and try to beat us.”
As a result, the importance of Friday and Saturday nights’ matchups for Harvard has only been amplified.
Friday, the Crimson will take on the Tigers live on ESPNU at Jadwin Gymnasium, where Harvard snapped a 24-game losing streak just a season ago. Princeton is led by sophomore guard Spencer Weisz, the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and leading scorer this season for his squad at 13.1 points per game.
Defensively, Saunders and junior Agunwa Okolie will likely share the task of slowing down Weisz, as both guards present the necessary size.
“[Princeton’s] style and their system puts them in a position to space the floor and do all of those things,” Amaker said. “Nothing that we haven’t seen out of them in the past, but certainly they are always a challenge given their philosophy and their system.”
Nonetheless, the Crimson surely seems up to the task, as Harvard currently ranks 13th in the NCAA in fewest points allowed per game at 57.2.
Offensively, going inside could be the key for the Crimson in securing its second conference win of the season. Princeton has struggled to both rebound and block shots on the interior this season, and the likely return of senior center Kenyatta Smith combined with the recent rise of senior Jonah Travis could play a big factor.
Meanwhile, Saturday’s contest at the Palestra will present an entirely different challenge: stopping 6’ 11’’ center Darien Nelson-Henry. Nelson-Henry is coming off a 14-point performance in a win over Saint Joseph’s, a formidable Atlantic 10 conference team.
However, stopping Nelson-Henry may not be the biggest problem for Harvard, who ranks 21st in the NCAA in blocks per game, as a lack of size might affect the Crimson’s ability to score in the paint.
Unless Amaker chooses to give sophomore Zena Edosomwan his fourth start of the season, Harvard will have no player at tip-off that is listed above 6’ 7’’.  As a result, the play of its guards, particularly junior captain Siyani Chambers and sophomore Corbin Miller, could be pivotal in stretching out the Quaker’s defense from beyond the arc.
Though the Crimson handily beat Penn by a combined 50 points in last year’s two matchups, this Quaker team boasts the addition of freshman Antonio Woods. Woods, a nifty guard who dropped 18 points against No. 5 ranked Villanova, could keep Chambers busy throughout the game.
In the 59 seasons of Ivy League play, only 14 teams have begun conference play either 0-1 or 1-1 and still been crowned the champion. In fact, the last team to win the conference after starting 1-1 was Penn in the 2001-02 season.
On Friday, Harvard will look to take its first step to becoming number 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2015, at 2:05 a.m.
So we meet again, dear Around the Ivies reader.
Last we parted, the Crimson was traveling to Yale with a chance to sew up its fourth consecutive league title. Harvard would wrap up a historically dominant 13-1 Ivy League season with consecutive road victories over Yale and Brown before advancing to the third round of the NCAA Tournament, where it took a brief second half lead against Michigan State before falling late. Yale reached the finals of the CIT—a notable accomplishment for a team that hasn’t made the Dance since 1962.
Two games into conference season, the teams appear to have swapped roles. Harvard (11-5, 1-1 Ivy) began the season in the top-25, prompting some exuberant undergraduates to pronounce them the best mid-major in the country. Since, it put forth an underwhelming nonconference season before giving up a 26-2 run to Dartmouth Saturday to drop out of the top two in the league for the first time since 2009. Yale (13-6, 2-0), meanwhile, knocked off defending champion Connecticut in December and came back last weekend to knock off Brown at home and move into first place. Tuesday, Joe Lunardi slotted the Bulldogs into his bracket for the first time this year.
Princeton (8-9, 1-0) —which holds a losing record—rounds out the top three; were the standings to continue, it would be the sixth consecutive year the three teams finished in the top four. Dartmouth and Columbia simmer in a tie for third, dark horses with their share of weaknesses. For the Big Green (8-8, 1-1), it is a lack of outside shooting beyond sensational guard Alex Mitola and a new ban on hard alcohol. For the Lions (9-7, 1-1), the missing presence of Alex Rosenberg—who withdrew from college after breaking his foot in the fall—looms large for a team whose best player is best known as “Chairman Maodo.”
Cornell, Penn, and Brown round out the standings—each with fundamental flaws. The Big Red (9-9, 1-1) has an excellent defense but a poor offense, with few prolific three-point shooting threats beyond Robert Hatter. The Bears (9-10, 0-2) are tough inside, but shaky on the perimeter. The Quakers' (5-10, 0-2) Ivy opener—more on that later—prompted a local column that suggested coach Jerome Allen may be on the hot seat. Of course, 10 months ago members of the Penn women's lacrosse team were reported to be defacing local bars—stealing alcohol, breaking furniture, and, most offensively, tipping less than four percent on a $1300 tab. On-court concerns seem secondary.
Amidst all this upheaval—and, well, debauchery—the Ivy League is a solid 15th in Jeff Sagarin’s conference ratings. At the time of year where small sample sizes have fans overreacting—West Virginia is great! Look out for Georgia!—nobody has separated themselves from the pack in the Ivy League. The 14-game tournament often has the unpleasant side effects of killing teams’ title hopes by the fourth week of the season; this year, no team looks to be the clear juggernaut Harvard was last year, when it blazed a path through the league General Sherman would have been proud of.
Without further ado, onto the action, boss.
BROWN at CORNELL
Perhaps the most underappreciated team in the Ivy League is the frisky Big Red. Since starting a Cornell-like 2-4, the Big Red has won seven of 12 and were three points from sweeping Columbia earlier this year. Previous columnists in this space have opined we should kick them out of the Ancient Eight, but I have a soft spot for the Big Red.
Pick: Cornell
YALE at COLUMBIA
Two years ago, this column saluted Yale forward Brandon Sherrod for not quitting the game of basketball after Harvard senior Wesley Saunders embarrassed him with a SportsCenter Top Ten-quality posterizing. Sherrod saw our ante and three bet under the gun, quitting basketball last May to join Yale’s most exclusive a capella group, the Whiffenpoofs—whose name was chosen, to nobody’s surprise, by a man referred to as ‘Goat’.
If Yale chokes away the Ivy title in what Sherrod noted “is supposed to be THE year”, I’m officially naming this the Brandy Goat Curse. It’ll be like the one that plagues the Cubs, only with much more hard liquor and sweater vests.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH at PENN
The Quakers’ first Ivy League contest of the year was fitting. Up 15 at archrival Princeton, Penn blew its best chance at ending a six-game road losing streak to the pesky Tigers. For a team that finished in the top three eight consecutive times at the beginning of the century, the Quakers’ quick fall from grace makes Lindsay Lohan’s twenties look gradual by comparison.
However, Penn snapped a 12-game losing streak to Big Five opponents Sunday with a win over St. Joe’s, prompting The Daily Pennsylvanian columnist Riley Steele to note that “it’s hard not to feel some sort of positive emotion”. If Penn wins again here, ol’ Riles might even approach what the rest of us call ‘excitement’.
Pick: Dartmouth
HARVARD at PRINCETON
Since 2009, neither of these teams has finished worse than third in conference play. The two do it in different sides of the floor; watching Princeton’s beautiful cutting offense attack the suffocating Crimson defense is basketball at its best. Last year, Harvard won in Jadwin Arena for the first time in a quarter century despite the efforts of Spencer Weisz, who had 12 points and seven rebounds. The sophomore, who leads Princeton in scoring this year with 13.1 points a game, will look to join a history of successful Princeton guards with a history of beating up on the Crimson. In fact, many of this legion, including David Blatt, John Thompson III, and New York Knicks GM Steve Mills, have gone on to have very successful basketball careers post-graduation.
Well, scratch that last one.
Pick: Harvard.
BROWN at COLUMBIA
I expect roughly the same things from this game and this weekend's senior class First Chance Dance: a poor two-hour showing of missed chances, poor footwork, and inability to finish that sets the tone for a semester of extended nostalgia and day drinking.
Pick: Columbia
YALE at CORNELL
The stats tell us that this is the conference’s best team going against arguably its top player—Cornell forward Shonn Miller, who leads the league in defensive win shares. Unfortunately for Cornell, the Big Red have had roughly the same amount of success recently defending their home court that Tom had chasing Jerry.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH at PRINCETON
A week into the new year, The Dartmouth reported that 64 students have been implicated in a cheating scandal for a class titled “Sports, Ethics, & Religion.” The class was targeted to student-athletes, who made up just under 70 percent of the total enrollment. I’m going to avoid the temptation to make jokes about cheating in an ethics class. Especially because, with Dartmouth professors suggesting we celebrate the kids who didn’t cheat instead of focusing on the ones who did—roughly analogous to spending Hall of Fame conversations talking about Jeff Francoeur and not Barry Bonds—the jokes here all write themselves.
Pick: Princeton
HARVARD at PENN
This contest looms as a classic trap game for the Crimson. Although Harvard waxed the Quakers by a combined 50 points in its two meetings last year, this year’s Crimson has not proved it deserves the plaudits of last year’s edition. Harvard has already dropped winnable contests to Holy Cross, Boston College, and Dartmouth after fading late, holding on by the skin of its teeth against Bryant and Vermont.
Penn has the horses to give Harvard trouble, however. The Quakers boast a strong frontcourt headed by junior Darien Nelson-Henry—a punishing body down low and the unofficial captain of last year’s All-Ivy Facial Hair Squad. Two years ago, a similar Crimson squad lost here to put its Ivy League title hopes on the brink. If Harvard loses Friday, it may find itself in a similarly desperate situation.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a major blow to the Harvard men’s ice hockey team, top defenseman Patrick McNally ’15-16 confirmed Thursday night that he will not play for the rest of the regular season after sustaining a lower body injury during a game last week.
“I will be out for probably the remainder of the season, but there is a chance that I could be back for the [ECAC Hockey] playoffs,” McNally said on Thursday night.
Currently ranked fourth in the nation, Harvard will compete in the ECAC Tournament in March and is on pace to qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
In an away game against Cornell last Friday, McNally limped off the ice with the help of a trainer after making incidental contact with a Cornell player near the Harvard goal.
“When my left leg went up in the air, I didn’t really have anything else to support it other than my right leg, which kind of buckled underneath me,” McNally said.
McNally declined to disclose the precise nature of the injury, but if any of his knee ligaments are damaged or torn, he could face several months of rehabilitation.
That could mean the end of McNally’s collegiate career. The Long Island native currently ranks second among all NCAA Division I defensemen in points per game. An academic junior playing in his fourth season with the Crimson, McNally will not know whether he will be eligible to play next season before the end of this academic year.
McNally withdrew from the College alongside co-captain and fellow defenseman Max Everson ’15-16 after the first nine games of the 2012-2013 season. The two returned to play after the first nine games of the 2013-2014 season in hopes of recouping their preceding year of athletic eligibility.
McNally said Thursday that he is currently focused on rehabilitation and does not know his eligibility status beyond this year.
After finishing at the bottom of its conference the last two seasons, Harvard has been resurgent this year. The team is currently second in the ECAC standings and is tied for third in the national PairWise rankings, which are a strong predictor of selection to the NCAA Tournament.
McNally, a draft pick of the NHL’s Vancouver Canucks, has played a critical role in that success with a breakout year, logging major minutes while scoring more than three times as many points (16) as the next highest-scoring defenseman on the Crimson roster.
The loss has immediate implications for Harvard’s hopes to win its first Beanpot—an annual tournament between Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern which begins this Monday at TD Garden—since 1993. It also hurts Harvard’s chances for a postseason run and a national title shot.
“‘Devastating’ I guess is the first word that comes to mind,” said Joshua Kummins, a writer for SB Nation College Hockey.
Josh Seguin, an ECAC analyst for College Hockey News, also said the loss was significant.
“Pat McNally did everything for Harvard from that blue line,” Seguin said. “He gave them goals; he was really having a resurgent season. It will be a tough loss, but I think Harvard has enough depth to get by, to get through it.”
