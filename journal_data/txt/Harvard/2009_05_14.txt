After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of his $17 billion in proposed cuts to the federal budget, Barack Obama has called for the elimination of two programs relating to one of the Bush administration’s more unfortunate social policies: abstinence-only sex education. Obama proposes replacing the two programs, each costing $100 million, with $110 million for comprehensive sex education, for a net savings of $90 million. While the savings involved are small, the policy change is commendable. Abstinence-only sex education programs have been repeatedly shown to be ineffective, misleading, and even bigoted, while comprehensive programs have seen widespread success.Study after study has shown abstinence-only programs have almost no impact on teens’ sexual behavior. One, commissioned by Congress and conducted by Mathematica Policy Research over the course of nine years, found that students receiving abstinence-only education had sex no later than those who did not. The number of sexual partners and use of contraception did not differ between the groups either. Another study, from Johns Hopkins, found that students who take virginity pledges—a key part of many abstinence-only curricula—were no less likely to have premarital sex than those who do not. More frighteningly, the Johns Hopkins study also found that students taking such pledges were significantly less likely to use condoms or other forms of birth control. The science, then, is clear. Abstinence-only education is useless at best and counterproductive at worst.What’s more, abstinence-only programs tend to spread misinformation and sexist stereotypes. According to a report prepared by the House Committee on Government Reform, abstinence-only curricula have claimed that HIV can be spread through tears, that abortion causes sterility, and that condoms fail to stop HIV transmission in 31 percent of cases. None of these claims, of course, is true. The report goes on to mention multiple instances of sexist content in abstinence-only programs, including one class that told students, “Women gauge their happiness and judge their success by their relationships. Men’s happiness and success hinge on their accomplishments.”Even in public schools, many abstinence-only programs are run by religious organizations. For example, the federal government gave the Catholic Diocese of Orlando an $800,000 grant to teach abstinence. This intermingling of church and state would be inappropriate enough even if it did not translate to religiously biased teaching. But, in many cases, the House report found it did just that, as the program promoted religious dogma such as the belief that life begins at conception, or that fetuses are “thinking persons”, as scientific fact. While privately funded religious abstinence-only programs are acceptable, using religious curricula in public schools violates the separation of church and state and alienates students who hold a different, or no, faith.There is a better way. Studies have shown that comprehensive sex education, including discussion of condoms and other contraceptives, is an effective way of preventing teen pregnancy. In countries with more liberal attitudes about teen sexuality and sex education—including most of Western Europe and especially Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands—rates of teen pregnancy, STD transmissions, and abortion are consistently low. While Obama’s budget shuffle will not suddenly turn the tide, it is a move in the right direction. Rather than obfuscating sexual activity as abstinence-only programs do, comprehensive sex education programs like the new one Obama is creating respect teens’ individual agency and freedom and give them the information they need to make good choices sexually.

In 1937, in an attempt to discover the variables predicting happiness, researchers decided to track 268 Harvard sophomores over the course of their lives. Subjects were recommended on the basis of their “normality”; as study supervisor Dr. Arlie Bock explained to The Crimson in 1942, “To alleviate the disharmony of the world at large, we must start with the successful man rather than the unsuccessful, frustrated, or ill man.” Those chosen were Harvard men in the old sense: hale, well-adjusted sorts who kept a copy of A Shropshire Lad in their back pockets and wore blazers to lunch. For the next 72 years, through mental surveys and periodic physical checkups, their every move would be documented.
The archived results of this study, published for the first time in the June issue of The Atlantic, are somewhat underwhelming. Education, marriage, moderate alcohol intake, and exercise are fairly reliable predictors of happiness; so are certain “mature adaptations” taken in responding to challenges, such as maintaining a sense of humor and channeling aggressive feelings into  more healthful channels like athletics. As for offering any definitive answer as to how to live the good life, no convenient elixir is forthcoming. That the study fell short of the bright-eyed ideals with which it commenced, however, is only to be expected—psychology may be able to trace the outer manifestations of human action, but it can never tell us through scientific analysis alone how to lead the good life.
That hasn’t stopped it from trying. By now, the phenomenon of “positive psychology” has become a fairly tired trope. But when it burst onto the scene in the late ’90s, it seemed like something entirely new, poised to provide innovative answers to the really big questions. With its fusion of self-help and brain science, it was perfectly calculated to appeal to soul-searching undergrads desirous of something a touch more quantitative than Nietzsche. A lecture course taught by Tal Ben-Shahar on “how to get happy” quickly became the most popular class at Harvard, with students carefully copying down chestnuts like “Give yourself permission to be human” from the blackboard. Over 200 similarly themed courses likewise sprouted up in universities across the United States, drawing consistently large audiences. Nor was this a fad, like phone-booth-stuffing or streaking, for bored college kids alone. Baby boomers—Oprah not excluded—consumed the newest books on happiness research as fast as publishers could roll them out, sating the metaphysical void once filled by “The Tao of Physics.”
The very popularity of this “science of happiness,” though, suggests that its appeal didn’t lie in the science alone. Pure data sets rarely inspire anyone to grand existential epiphanies. (Does anybody actually read the American Journal of Psychology for fun?) The recent offerings instead glide seamlessly from real cognitive scientific results into life prescriptions of the kind traditionally proffered by fields like religion and literature. The current overseer of the Grant Study results, George Vaillant, himself studied not psychology but history and literature when he was at Harvard; indeed, it may be the literary quality of many psychological findings that makes them go down so smooth for a meaning-hungry public. In my tutorial this year, Freud was sandwiched as a social thinker between Durkheim and Beauvoir—but really, my section leader told us, the Germans read him as poetry.
If meaning is poetry, then science must be mere prose. But where does that leave us? With my own sophomore year winding to a close, I think of the infinite possibility those Harvard men must have felt, believing that they were contributing to making the world a better place. To deny the Grant Study its ambitious objective to pinpoint the causes of happiness has a whiff of the wet blanket about it. But there’s something even more miserable about thinking that our happiness can be defined by the jobs we choose, or what we eat for breakfast, or how many miles we run each week. Freud himself pointed out that the only thing normal is pathology, which makes applying a bell-curve-style prescription for joy more than a little reductionist. Even if all the indicators in our lives point to success, a craving for something indefinable may persist. Aristotle, for instance, thought that happiness was found in living well, and living well meant living with virtue—a distinction that the Grant would elide.
Perhaps this is the most important lesson of the study: the realization of just how elusive the elements that constitute a happy life really are. In one of his books, Vaillant writes of his subjects that “Their lives were too human for science, too beautiful for numbers, too sad for diagnosis and too immortal for bound journals.” It’s an oddly elegiac comment for a supposedly objective psychologist. Vaillant was especially affected by one of his patients, Case No. 47, who wrote that happiness for him was being able to say on one’s deathbed that “I sure squeezed that lemon!” An unscientific observation, no doubt, but none the less true for that.Jessica A.

In Time Magazine’s Dec. 18 issue, John Cloud audaciously proclaimed that “[then-Senator] Obama has proved himself repeatedly to be a very tolerant, very rational-sounding sort of bigot. He is far too careful and measured a man to say anything about body parts fitting together or marriage being reserved for the nonpedophilic, but all the same, he opposes equality for gay people when it comes to the basic recognition of their relationships.” 
While many proponents of same-sex marriage would ridicule Cloud’s indictment of Obama’s supposed bigotry, he is not the only one spouting this slanderous illogic. To claim that opposition to same-sex marriage makes one a foe of gay equality is to essentially argue, as Cloud does, that all same-sex marriage opponents are bigots, for bigotry is marked by hostility toward the fundamental principle of equality for all. However, while homophobia unquestionably impels many to oppose same-sex marriage, it is not a prerequisite for that stance. While I am personally a proponent of gay marriage, it is not just bigots who are not.
On May 6, Maine Governor John Baldacci signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in his state, announcing that “I have come to believe that this is a question of fairness and of equal protection under the law.” Baldacci’s declaration, among many others, implies that same-sex marriage is an issue of equal rights. It is not. Unlike hostility toward miscegenation in an earlier era, hostility toward same-sex marriage can be induced by more than simple prejudice, for same-sex marriage is not an existing right, but an entirely new one. The pursuit of its legalization is not about demolishing barriers that barricade certain members of society from a treasured institution; it is about fundamentally redefining that institution.
As marriage is currently defined, homosexuals do technically possess the right to marry, as they are fully permitted to wed a member of the opposite sex. Obviously, this definition is flawed: It defines a relationship in terms of reproduction—sterile couples being the lone contradiction—rather than love, and it ought to be revised. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that permitting same-sex marriage is indeed a redefinition of marriage.
Active redefinition can open the doors to further redefinition, as marriage is an institution arbitrarily defined by society. This does not imply that those who advocate legalizing same-sex marriage must favor legalizing incest and polyamory. “Open the doors” does not mean “approve,” “encourage,” or “support.” Nor does it in any way legitimize pedophilia and bestiality (as many conservative commentators have attempted to claim), for the stipulation of mutual consent is supported by near-universal consensus. However, incest and polyamory were not always taboo. Ancient Egypt’s Pharaonic pedigree was rife with incest, for example, and polygamy was once the status quo. 
In fact, the same arguments that many proffer in favor of same-sex marriage can also justify incest. If marriage ought to be redefined as a union of two consenting, loving individuals in which reproduction is not a factor, then what reason is there to prevent two siblings or cousins from marrying? Reproduction cannot be a stipulation for marriage, as that would bar infertile couples from wedding. But then what stipulation would prohibit incest? The answer, of course, is incest’s status as a taboo. 
By legalizing a form of marriage because it is no longer anathema to the majority, we acknowledge the fact that social taboos are the guiding principle of the modern definition of marriage. In this new legal environment, all candidate definitions are necessarily discriminatory toward some form of relationship. Otherwise, all conceptions of marriage would be permitted. Therefore, by extension, it is unfair to categorically label the proponents of one arbitrary definition bigots for not supporting another arbitrary definition. 
Incest and polyamory are two models of marriage that, in a vacuum, are as legitimate as monogamy and same-sex marriage, as both involve consenting adults but violate the reproductive norm of one man and one woman. Should incest and polyamory be permitted? No, as society has come to a consensus that they should not be. But this agreement is an arbitrary one, as is the current agreement that marriage should be between a man and a woman. Let us then recognize that a new agreement upon the definition of marriage as the union of two consenting, non-incestuous adults regardless of gender would be equally arbitrary.
As such, when one voices a desire to preserve traditional marriage, it is not necessarily due to homophobia. Often, it is due to the fear of accepting that the definition of marriage is whatever we dictate it to be and that this reality debases the legitimacy of any boundaries we set. When we start actively redefining an already arbitrary institution, we give ourselves the power to redefine it as we please. Such redefinition is not wrong, but it does not mandate that its opponents be bigots.

To the editors:Harvard’s support for Barack Obama during his presidential campaign was enthusiastic and near-unanimous. When he won, the university was jubilant. His ideals of shared sacrifice and spreading the wealth, however, appear to have made few inroads on campus (“HLS Will Cut Staff To Trim Budget,” News, May 6).While faculty and top administrators, most of who earn six figures, face the annoyance of not receiving pay raises, staff and service workers are threatened with losing their jobs altogether. In this economy, it is unlikely they can find new ones.In The Crimson and elsewhere, calls have been made for administrators, faculty, and higher-paid staff to take pay cuts to save jobs. Other institutions have done just this, but at Harvard these calls go unanswered.Harvard has the reputation of preaching concern for the public good but not practicing such concern when it comes to its own affairs. Unless administrators, faculty, and higher-paid staff start to share some of the sacrifice, instead of foisting it all on those who earn far less, the university will continue to deserve this dubious reputation.Stephen HelferCambridge, Mass.May 11, 2009Stephen Helfer has been an HLS library assistant for 22 years.

To the editors:As someone who has gotten to know Cabot Resident Dean Mya M. Mangawang this past semester through her freshman seminar, I’d like to give some balance to The Crimson’s article on her depature (“Controversial Cabot Resident Dean Departs,” News, May 8). Mya Mangawang has always been enthusiastic about her role in Cabot House. With Housing Day approaching a few months ago, she polled our class about our preferences, acknowledging that we would be happy anywhere but promoting the Quad and her beloved Cabot House. When I told Mya one of my current roommates and close friends was placed in Cabot, she requested her email address and expressed how excited she was to get to know the new freshman. That night, my roommate received an email from Mya (to which I was copied) welcoming her to the House and encouraging her and her blocking group to get in touch with any questions. She ended the email hoping to meet them at the imminent Cabot House festivities and giving her “sincere welcome” to the community. To me, none of this indicates an “‘unspoken distaste’ for Cabot students,” as this article mentions, and I find it extremely difficult to believe there is not a single student in Cabot House whom The Crimson could find for a positive comment about this remarkable individual. Needless to say, I was truly surprised to hear of Mya’s resignation and am disappointed by the one-sided nature of this article. Elizabeth Fryman ’12 Cambridge, Mass.May 8, 2009

To the editors:In discussing NATO’s efforts to protect Georgia from further Russian aggression (“Exercising Power in Georgia,” Opinion, May 13), Ellen C. Bryson offers readers much information that is incomplete and misleading.Ms. Bryson fails to inform readers that Russia has recently stood alone against the entire Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to block impartial observers from monitoring the disputed border between Russia and Georgia. Thus, it is Russia that leaves NATO with no alternative other than military confrontation.She fails to acknowledge that Russia has played a key and improper role in supporting the opposition protesters on Georgia’s streets, and she fails to admit that the protesters refused to carry on any discussions with the Saakashvili regime  except regarding the terms of the democratically elected president’s resignation.She fails to recognize Russia’s profound military weakness (while invading Georgia, many of its officers were reduced to communciating on their personal cell phones) or the effect of the nation’s recent economic collapse (stock market down three quarters, reserves down half, currency value down a third, double-digit unemployment and inflation). NATO in fact has far more power over Russia than Ms. Bryson imagines.She attempts to impugn President Saakashvili’s democratic credentials, ignoring the fact that he is besieged by a giant neighbor where even vestigial democratic politics have been totally liquidated. The fact that Georgia remains to any extent democratic in the face of this threat is a miracle owing only to Saakashvili’s amazing personal courge.But most of all, Ms. Bryson ignores the proven-effective doctrine of deterrence. NATO failed to take aggressive action to show solidarity with Georgia in 2008, and Russia invaded. By showing resolve in 2009, NATO is helping to deter a second invasion.Kim ZigfeldNew York City, N.Y.May 14, 2009Kim Zigfeld is the publisher of the Russia blog “La Russophobe,” and the Russia columnist for the American Thinker and Pajamas Media websites.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
FlyBy is sorry.  This is wrong.  But we wasted three hours on it, and we want you to feel our pain.
Run!
What?  It keeps dropping you right back in, doesn't it?  That's how it gets you.  Trust, FlyBy's only trying to assure you make it to breakfast.  You know, to protest.
O_O
Sections
It appears that the administration has finally let the chips fall.  The budget cuts are out.  Much like our friend Bob Barker, FlyBy lets you know if each cut is a winner, or worth sending home.
It's 8 AM, and you've just rolled out of bed to make it to that 9 AM intensive language class. No morning haze allowed: you will translate, speak, or spout verb forms and do it with a smile. Before 9 AM, though, you may be groggily walking through your House's tunnels to the dining hall to wolf down some combination of eggs, sausages, and bacon. Sure, it isn't healthy, but since you probably stayed up till 4 AM memorizing those verb forms anyway, health has become irrelevant at this point.
But next year, unless you're willing to trek over to Annenberg, the only hot stuff to greet the eye is going to be hard-boiled eggs--even though many 9 AM class sufferers and those athletes (who just so happen to have to wake up 3 hours earlier and be 10 times more intense) may need something a little more exciting to start the day. Without the draw of bacon and potatoes to get us up in the morning, we might as well just stay up late to do homework and grab that Red Bull--especially with newly enhanced brain breaks! All the athletes who wake up before dawn will also find it that much harder to beat Yale.
Students protested by swiping into breakfast en masse this morning  in the House dining halls. But before that, almost every House list has had a massive chain about the cut to hot breakfast. Some gems after the jump:
Quincy
Lowell
2. Who cares.. people are being fired -- 'cutting proctors makes sense, but damnit cutting my morning bacon is simply barbaric!'..
3.  Cutting shuttle service.. fucking sucks.. They are cutting the night shuttle service by hours.  This is both a huge annoyance for quad folk AND a safety risk, given the apparently large number of lecherous Harvard men who wait in the wings on weekend nights. This is probably a lot worse than the hot breakfast cuts, though I'm sure somebody will have some stupid snarky reply about how 'THE QUAD SUCKS BRO.. BUT YUM I LOVE PANCAKES,' etc.
Mather
jump through hoops in the morning to get a crappier version at Annenberg.
Hot breakfast is not a staple of my diet because I couldn't physically eat
other things, but because it is one of the only things I enjoy eating. I
wouldn't starve if I ate birdseed, drank milk, and took a multivitamin.
Matherites and I came up with the following solution:
Take Kirkland House, kick everyone in it out of school (after they've paid
tuition for next year). Stop serving meals in that house- all meals. This
alone will save over $900,000.
We could use the House either for social space, or sell it for millions of
dollars to be used to offset the budget deficit, or hire back all of the
staff getting laid off, or provide retirement packages.
Plus we wouldn't have to deal with Kirkland.
Give everyone else full breakfast, make the shuttles run full-time, and
provide full housing for J-Term.
The opinion was also stated that instead of cutting breakfast, we should
just cut YardFest- it would upset fewer people.
In response, a few Matherites said that in all seriousness, they agreed with cutting Yardfest.
Adams
Rumors abound that the administration is planning to cut dining hall workers as a result of cutting breakfast. One cook in Adams has even pinpointed a target number: eliminating two dining hall workers from every House, either through early retirement or layoffs. How does he know this secret information? A student forwarded this email over to Adams Schmooze:
we were told today that we would suffer layoffs in september. you may have heard that yesterday evening the university notified the students on their web site that starting in september no more hot breakfast. the harvard corporation using this attack on the students intended to cut 2 workers from every hall. we need to meet to go over what we can do . we are trying to reserve a room at pbh in the yard with the help of the students this thrusday for shop stewards and activists. we then can plan a meeting with the members early next week. the students are angry we will have allies as we organize
ed childs
chief-steward local 26
please contact with ideas or info
Oh, it's getting serious.  Childs stated that he got this from Bill Murphy, Director of Labor Relations, who told him the most likely scenario is the release of two workers from each dining hall.
UC President Andrea Flores even told Cabot House they should get their parents involved:
Follow the money, right?

This finals week, in many ways, is the last of its kind.
But most students might be unaware that during next year's finals, they will be pulling all-nighters not with the help of the traditional dining hall coffee, but with the aid of a new brew.
This morning about a dozen students gathered in Queen's Head Pub to taste, enjoy, and ultimately score three coffee brands.
New England Coffee set up along with two other vendors, Green Mountain Coffee and Seattle's Best, and all three proceeded to woo students with charming salemanship, sweet treats, and of course, smooth coffee.
More on this sweet event, after the jump.
The coffee tasting event was the first of its kind at Harvard; HUDS has been serving New England Coffee for the past 40 years.
But due to negative feedback concerning the quality of the coffee, HUDS realized it might be time for a change, said Crista Martin, the HUDS Director for Marketing & Communications.
It'll be interesting to see who comes out on top.  In the meantime, anyone have a coffee maker?  FlyBy needs to unleash the potential of these free beans.  Soon.
