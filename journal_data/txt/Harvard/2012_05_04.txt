After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since 1975, the Q (or “CUE”) guide has let students evaluate their courses for the benefit of their peers. Its by-students-for-students nature made it perfect for this role—if people hated the course, they made it clear; if it was easy, they made that clear too. In recent years, however, the Q has been appropriated for another role: teacher evaluation. Administrators—in their push to bring about a greater faculty emphasis on teaching—have come to rely in part on professors’ Q scores for performance reviews, pay raises, and promotions. Certain faculty members have voiced strong opposition to the practice, suggesting that the Q guide is fickle and a poor measure of student learning. Regardless of whether the Q itself is an ideal—or even good—measure of teaching ability, we fully support the inclusion of student experience in considering professors’ raises and promotions. Teachers ought to be incentivized to provide a positive learning experience for their pupils.
As it stands, the Q is a very useful tool for students shopping courses. If faculty members are concerned that it doesn’t currently get at the heart of a student’s learning experience, we are confident that changes in design could make it better suited for this purpose. Students are certainly capable of evaluating both their teachers and their own learning experiences. The goal of the administration should be to devise a system that is designed for the explicit purpose of student evaluations for faculty use. What’s more, student teaching evaluations could be simply one part of a broader evaluation process.
For example, Harvard Business School, as well as the life sciences departments at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have already instituted systems where professors evaluate each others’ teaching ability. Universal implementation of this kind of evaluation would temper many of the faculty’s present concerns over student evaluation, and would likely provide a more complete picture of a professor’s pedagogical practices in the process.
At the end of the day, we must remember that the goal of bringing greater emphasis to teaching at Harvard is the only non-negotiable. The question of how exactly to get there is simply a matter of implementation, to be solved by trial, error, and research.
It is important to remember as we seek to improve faculty’s commitment to teaching at Harvard that the learning experience is very much a two-way street. If we approach courses in good faith, going to—and paying attention in—lecture, and seeking to engage the professor, we are more likely to come away with a positive experience. It is important to ask more of our professors, but we must also make sure we’re upholding our end of the bargain. We’ve all been in the class where we stared at our laptop through every lecture and then gave it an abysmal Q score. Maybe we wouldn’t have stared at our laptop if the lectures had been better, but maybe the lectures would have been better if the professor wasn’t teaching to 500 Apple logos. This institution exists to provide, among other things, a fruitful learning environment. The administration's emphasis on student evaluation is undoubtedly serving that goal, and we hope to see it continue in the future.

After listening to around 45 minutes of an hour-long lecture, the urge to check his or her smart phone can be overwhelming.  A usual destination is Facebook, then perhaps Gmail and, for the very ambitious, LinkedIn.  The slightly more arts-oriented classmates will upload pictures to Flickr and the gaming community will be engrossed in some visually stimulating alternative universe. Fast-forward to 2070, and each of us will find a lifetime of digital content tied to our identity.  Thousands of documents and photos may be stored on your hard drive, some cloud software or, more likely, something that has yet to be invented.  What happens to all this digital property when we are no longer around? According to an article in New Scientist, 250,000 Facebook users are going to die next year, which poses the question of how we should view digital property and what, if any, laws should regulate it.
There are two different schools of thought regarding the future of digital property and data.  The “preservationists” claim that we owe it to future generations to keep all our embarrassing pictures, offhand comments, and incriminating status updates.  Future archeologists, sociologists, anthropologists, psychologists, and economists will have access to incredible amounts of data from the dawn of the World Wide Web and the digital age. The other camp, originally named the “deletionists,” believes it is important that the internet learn how to forget and move on. The deletionists also point out that without the deletion of content after death, the Internet will eventually be awash with dead data, as the dead will inevitably outnumber the living.
Today multiple organizations and companies hoard data in order to understand and profit from our behavior and preferences. Importantly, platforms such as Facebook, Flickr or Gmail have separate servers, making it unclear to whom the data belongs after death.  The European Union has enshrined “the right to be forgotten” as a key objective in their 2011 data protection strategy.  The right to be forgotten means that users have the right to ask for their data to be removed once the original purpose of the data has been met.  But in many countries digital property rights are still unchartered territory with most people not accounting for digital property in their will.
We have to learn to include digital property in our will, as it possesses not only sentimental value but also economic value.  Emails from actors, presidents, Nobel Prize winners or sport figures will surely have monetary and historical worth. Similarly digital intellectual property rights also become controversial as it is unclear who owns them post mortem.  There have already been incidents where parents who are distressed at the death of their children and are unable to guess the password to their children’s online accounts have been refused access.  To add to the mess, an increasing number of financial contracts and important documents are sent over email. In order for family members to clean up after the deceased, access to email accounts can become vital.
Although individual privacy is important, we also need to focus on the aggregate data that is left behind on the Internet.  Most family members will not be willing to go through every single account and clean it up and put it into discs; instead the data will simply sit and rust.  In the case of Google, all your emails will be deleted after nine months without use and the entire account will be deleted after 12 months of inactivity. Imagine the amount of interesting information that is lost and can never be recovered by family members and future generations of academics.
So should our digital records be preserved? And if they should be preserved, who will be the ones to preserve them? Not only are our email accounts fickle, but also websites and important technology companies can also quickly become outdated and shut down. This happened to Geocities when Yahoo pulled the plug on them in 2009. Jason Scott decided to maintain and save as many Geocities pages as he could, creating a 641-gigabyte archive, which can be found at reocities.com.  By archiving seemingly trivial websites, our generation allows archeologists, artists, and social scientists to gain a comprehensive image of our lifestyle, hopes, and worries. There needs to be greater awareness and responsibility concerning digital property, as access to email accounts can become legal nightmares. If we feel that none of our data is protected past death, it may change what we leave for posterity, meaning that the data future academics do find may be compromised.

Not so long ago, the internet was inundated with tweets and posts containing the phrase “KONY 2012,” a reference to the most recent campaign of Invisible Children, an American nonprofit organization. “Kony” refers to Joseph Kony, the Ugandan leader of a rebel group that recruits child soldiers. Though seemingly well-intentioned, this campaign raised a great deal of well-deserved opposition due to both the long-standing controversy about Invisible Children’s credibility as a nonprofit and the way that Invisible Children chose to carry out the campaign. The controversy over the campaign also raises the larger question of the effectiveness of the sort of activism that KONY 2012 promotes, commonly known as armchair activism.
KONY 2012 encouraged people to take three actions: watch Invisible Children’s video about Kony, donate money to Invisible Children to receive a bracelet and information kit, and share the video with friends and tell as many people as possible about Kony and his band of child soldiers.
While the video does inform the viewer about Kony, the only action that this information can be translated into is donations to Invisible Children through the purchase of a bracelet kit. The problem with this course of action is twofold. Firstly, this money will not necessarily go toward helping child soldiers, or even to a good cause. Invisible Children has long been viewed with skepticism by the activist community for its extremely high administrative overhead, which leaves only about 30 percent of its earnings for programs on the ground. It seems that the money you spend on that bracelet kit is more likely to go into Jason Russell’s pocket than toward helping a child in East Africa.
The second problem with this course of action is that it allows the viewer to regard herself or himself as an activist who has done something noble and who has seen it to its end. It enables complacency, as instead of encouraging further reading and self-education on the topic or introducing the viewer to other organizations that deal with the issue of child soldiers, Invisible Children presents a self-promoting course of action and presents it as a solution. Once the viewer has shared the video he or she is a Good Samaritan and, perhaps more significantly, he or she is done.
It is never good when people are conditioned to expect that activism will make them feel good about themselves because it often doesn’t. Effective activism that creates lasting change takes effort and is often very frustrating. In fact, if an action is shiny, prepackaged, easy, and does not require any research or other sort of effort on the doer’s part, that is probably a sign that it is not going to be highly effective. If we hope to make a difference, it is essential that we are critical of such representations.
Armchair activism generally supports Band-aid solutions. One popular company that advocates for Band-aid solutions is TOMS, a shoe company that donates a pair of shoes to a child in Africa for every pair bought. Band-aid solutions are definitely necessary in their own right: systemic change takes time, and in the meantime, people still need to eat. If a child is hungry, he or she doesn’t care whether the food is coming from a sustainable local infrastructure or whether it comes from an aid group abroad. But TOMS doesn’t provide food—it provides shoes, which aren’t necessarily a pressing need in the lives of the people to whom they are given, despite TOMS’s insistence that they are.
The reason that TOMS can afford to offer the two-for-one deal on their shoes is that the shoes are cheaply made in developing countries. TOMS insists that the shoes are made for fair wages in good labor conditions. However, since there are no concrete guidelines as to what these fair wages and good labor conditions are, my guess would be that TOMS would be not be able to provide workers with the sort of wages that they would be legally compelled to provide factory workers in the United States.
If an organization like TOMS seems too good to be true (you get a pair of cute shoes and also get to help a child in Africa, which is basically one big starving country!), it probably is too good to be true. And if you’re surprised that you can help stop an African warlord from your divan, that surprise is probably not without cause. Armchair activism can be very effective in raising money and generating petition signatures, but we must realize that taking a small action like signing a petition does not excuse us from further action. We are not done. We must be wary of the ever-present dangers of armchair activism—complacency and self-righteousness—as we go out into the world hoping to make a difference in the lives of others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An open letter:
Two weeks ago, our campus welcomed 1,300 admitted students to the College, all here to assess whether Harvard College is the right place for them to spend the next four years.  This weekend, known as Visitas, is a chance for admitted students to learn what it means to be a Harvard student and to be a part of the greater Harvard community.
Nowhere are the strength and scope of this community more apparent than in the tireless work that you all put into making this weekend a unique experience.  Over 850 of you opened up your dorm rooms to admitted students, offering floor space and futons, as well as friendly advice and guidance around our campus.  Many of you played an active role in planning the over 100 student-run events that occurred on campus during the weekend, everything from debates and barbecues to performances and information sessions.  Some of you joined the House Committees and Peer Advising Fellows in welcoming students from back home during regional receptions held in the upperclass houses.  Still others merely offered a friendly face and a point in the right direction as admitted students made their way around campus, requisite red folders and Class of 2016 backpacks in tow.
Visitas is an immense undertaking that involves every corner of campus, and we rely on you to show admitted students what the Harvard College experience is really like. This year, you delivered on this promise once again.  As admitted students wandered back through Agassiz House to say farewell on Monday—a little tired but smiling nonetheless—the constant refrain was one of infectious excitement and eagerness for what is to come. One young woman said it best when she remarked, “I don’t want to leave.  I already feel like this is home.”
So, from the bottom of our hearts, thank you all for your hard work to make Visitas a success, and we hope you will demonstrate the same enthusiasm in welcoming these students to campus next year.
William R. Fitzsimmons '67 is the Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid at Harvard College. Valerie A. Beilenson ’07 is the Director of Visitas. M. Amelia Muller ’11 is the Assistant Director of Visitas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John T. Hamilton has the studied look of the stereotypical Harvard professor. Draped in tweed, with a vest underneath and elbow pads on his coat, he puffs insistently on a wooden pipe outside his office in the Department of Comparative Literature.
But before Hamilton picked up Homer and Virgil, he was picking guitar, and long before he came to Cambridge, Rolling Stone magazine had tapped him as an up-and-coming musician. For Hamilton, academia was an afterthought—during the first fifteen years of his adult life, he wrote, performed, and recorded rock music.
“It’s a very similar lifestyle,” Hamilton says nonchalantly.
He leans back in his chair at the kitchen table of his spacious Arlington house, painted purple on the outside. The sounds of drums and electric bass filter in from the basement, where his two sons, ages 11 and 15, are improvising rock riffs.
“Communicating, improvising, trying to sense people’s expectations and trying to meet them—those are all important issues,” he adds.
“It’s definitely not banking,” chimes in his wife Donna from across the table.
“It’s bankrupting,” she laughs.
John and Donna have been together for more than 30 years, but not just as husband and wife—“we’ve shared a life,” Hamilton says. Since meeting in high school, they’ve played in four different bands together, including Tiny Lights—a critically-acclaimed act that toured nationwide and released seven albums between 1983 and 1994.
“It was a really great way to grow up,” says Donna as Hamilton heads down to the basement to make a song request.
‘A HODGE-PODGE’
Dave Dreiwitz saw John and Donna play for the first time at a nightclub in Hoboken when he was 15 years old.
“I thought they were amazing,” he says. John and Donna, both just 18 at the time, were playing with a jazz fusion group called Low Key. “They seemed experienced,” Drewitiz adds.
Dreiwitz, now the bass player for the rock group Ween, became the third founding member of Tiny Lights a year later, in 1983.
“We liked a lot of the same kind of stuff,” Dreiwitz says. “We were all jazz heads.”
But Tiny Lights quickly grew into a group that defied genre, even when it came to instrumentation: Dreiwitz knew trumpet and bass, Donna played violin and sang vocals, and Hamilton wanted to incorporate non-traditional rock instruments.
In 1985, Hamilton invited another member to the band, Jane Scarpantoni. Scarpantoni, who is still in the music industry, has gone on to record with Bruce Springsteen, Sheryl Crow, and Christina Aguilera—on the cello.
“It takes a special bunch of people to let you just go with it and get used to playing in a group,” she says, remembering her transformation from a classical cellist to a rock musician. “Through them, I was able to get used to playing in a rock band.”
But the group was not just a rock band. In a newspaper interview, Hamilton would later describe Tiny Light’s music as “a hodge-podge of 1970s AM radio, folk music, and improvisatory tendencies.”
This mixed bag of sounds seemed to work for Tiny Lights. “A lot of people heard that sound and went: Wow! Strings!” says Scarpantoni. “I think they were a bit ahead of their time.”
The band branched out even further with the addition Andy Demos, a drummer, saxophone player, and talented multi-instrumentalist.
“Tiny Lights was going to be simple, happy, pretty,” Donna says. “We did whatever we wanted to do, basically—kind of like what John does at Harvard,” she ribs, turning to give her husband a cheeky glance. He chuckles.
‘MUSTARD CRUNCH’
After a few years of playing clubs in Hoboken, the group began touring in earnest in 1987, after Hamilton graduated from New York University with a degree in classics and German.
“We toured like mad,” Dreiwitz says. “John would just book these gigs in between working his restaurant job and going to NYU. He was the skipper and the captain and the navigator.”
Hamilton, who worked as a waiter, translator, and guitar teacher to pay the bills, managed all of the tours himself. Tiny Lights, he says, never had an agent or a publicist: “Just a telephone, a press kit, and our latest record.”
“We were a bunch of friends, going on the road, making music,” Scarpantoni recalls. “Sometimes we’d play for two people, and sometimes we’d play for hundreds.”
Concert performances for Tiny Lights were as eclectic as the sound the band would create. Before each show, Hamilton would survey the audience—Donna remembers it as him “feeling out” the crowd—and cue the other band members with a mood to start an improvised introduction. Tiny Lights traveled throughout the country and headlined at the first two South by Southwest Music Festivals in Austin, Texas.
But even as the group members gained recognition, their rock musician lives were far from lucrative. The five bandmates frequently shared one hotel room or slept at campgrounds.
Over a full plate of cookies on the kitchen table, Donna remembers when they had limited options for food. “When we were in the van, traveling at points, we had cereal, we had condiments—”
“So we made mustard crunch, by stirring in the cereal crumbs,” Hamilton interrupts. Both laugh. “In the morning, we found enough change in the bottom of the van to buy a cup of coffee, which we all shared.”
‘WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ROCK AND ROLL?’
Now sipping his very own coffee, Hamilton speaks with cool-headed erudition about the artistry of record-making—the challenge of blending and balancing each track, perfecting each voice with vintage microphones and tape. His eyes flash with interest and intensity when he talks music.
If the wooden pipe he occasionally produces from his coat pocket makes it hard to believe that he once played nightclubs with a rock band, his passion for music is unmistakable. And by most accounts, it always has been.
Hamilton grew up in a modest home in the Bronx, with non-musical, working-class parents. An only child, he taught himself to play guitar on a cheap acoustic.
“Very early on, I had the key to our apartment,” he says. “I found myself alone a lot, so I would read or play music.”
He was soon playing with friends and in church services. In the fourth grade, he wrote a musical called “Whatever Happened to Rock and Roll?” In the play, the protagonist, a young boy, hounds his parents for an electric guitar.
“I was almost screaming for an electric guitar,” Hamilton says. “We put it on at P.S. 119, P.S. 125—it was a little Bronx tour,” he says.
“My parents didn’t even see it. They both worked,” he adds with a chuckle.
Hamilton did get that electric guitar, eventually, and by the time he was in high school, he was playing in a band. Before long, a 16-year-old from another high school asked his group to play a song she had written.
It was Donna, and three months later, they were dating. “It wasn’t really a reflective time,” says Hamilton, trying to recall what sparked the romance. “We became ever closer as friends, working together, talking for hours on the telephone, working together until we finally realized that, you know, it was meant to be.”
STOP THE SUN; I WANT TO GO HOME
For nearly a decade, before and during Tiny Lights, John and Donna remained personal and professional partners.
“They’re almost like one being,” Dreiwitz says. “One feeds the other, and it’s always been like that.”
The two made it official in 1989, tying the knot when Tiny Lights was at its peak. They used their wedding money to buy an unfurnished condo, a far cry from the spacious home in Arlington where they live today. One week after the ceremony, they left for a three-month tour.
Scarpantoni left the group in 1991, and the band spent some time recording in California. There the members recorded their fourth album, “Stop the Sun I Want to Go Home,” in 1992. That same year, Tiny Lights earned a nod from Rolling Stone Magazine.
“Meanwhile, John’s in the van, reading Greek, reading Latin,” Donna remembers. “He’s got attention surplus disorder,” she says affectionately.
“The conversation in the van was not the normal conversation of people who are in a band,” Scarpantoni says, recalling long talks about history, art, and politics on tour drives. “He could discuss anything.”
“On the road, you only play an hour show,” Hamilton says. “The whole day is free to just read.”
Just as Hamilton was delving deeper into what he calls his “extended reading period,” the luster of Tiny Lights was beginning to fade.
“You go back to a place where you’ve played, and the crowd isn’t as big, and maybe you’re just not so into it anymore,” Donna says. “It just starts feeling sad.”
As time went on, Tiny Lights proved unwilling to change its image or its musical repertoire to court popular success. “We put so much emphasis on authenticity and honesty,” Hamilton says with a still-extant trace of artistic indignation. “It wasn’t just a show—we weren’t just performers—and it wasn’t a role we could just put on.”
It grew especially difficult for the band to keep touring and recording after 1994, when Hamilton began his graduate studies. “We just sort of faded out,” he says. Their first son, Jasper, was born in 1996, and Donna started teaching preschool a few years later.
“It’s a new phase of our lives,” Hamilton says, as Henry, their younger son, walks through the kitchen with a set of drumsticks in hand.
‘NEVER TAKEN LESSONS’
Most of the students in Hamilton’s literature seminar did not know about their professor’s history as a rock star—yet few seem shocked by the fact that their European Romanticism professor played in a band for 13 years.
“He has all these great anecdotes, and he makes a lot of musical references,” says Amrita S. Dani ’13. “It wouldn’t surprise me if he did anything.”
While Hamilton does not often bring up his time in the band in his class, the eclecticism that characterized Tiny Lights often shines through in his teaching. He regularly brings cookies to class and sometimes relates Romantic poems to Nirvana lyrics.
“Being in the classroom is a type of performance,” Hamilton says. “There’s a large element of improvisation.”
Long before he came to Harvard, Hamilton’s bandmates recognized his capacity to combine different disciplines.
“He integrates everything into everything that he does,” Scarpantoni says. “It’s not surprising to me that he became a Harvard professor, because in my mind, this guy always was one.”
Though perhaps, as Scarpantoni says, a natural professor, Hamilton still feels at home behind his guitar as well. The bandmates still stay in touch, and Tiny Lights even played a reunion show last year in New York.
“We still jam. We haven’t lost that joy of music,” Scarpantoni says.
Back at the purple house, Hamilton nods his head rhythmically in the bare-walled basement. Jasper sings lead vocals and plucks a bass riff; Henry tops it off with a drum solo.
“They’ve never taken lessons,” Hamilton tries to yell over the din, mostly in vain.
Neither did he.

Actor Scott Leo “Taye” Diggs and illustrator Shane W. Evans said that parents and educators can use picture books to help young children come to terms with their racial backgrounds during an event at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Thursday.
Diggs and Evans collaborated on the picture book “Chocolate Me!,” which was published last year. The book depicts the experience of a young black boy grappling with his physical differences from his white friends.
Diggs, a stage and screen performer known for roles in productions like “Rent” and “Chicago,” said that he was a victim of bullying as a black child living in a primarily white community. He said the plot of the book was inspired by the advice his mother gave him at the age of five—to embrace his appearance.
Diggs said his father only used the word “chocolate” to refer to black people. As a child, it was difficult for him to make sense of this terminology. “It would have been nice to have books to help me out,” he said.
Diggs and Evans said they have come to see that food terminology can be a positive means of explaining race to children.
“Chocolate is sweet and yummy and delicious,” Diggs said.
Evans said the process of publishing this book has led him to embrace this view of skin color. “I refer to people as flavors now actually because of this book,” Evans said.
Evans asked moderator Pamela Mason, a lecturer at the Ed School, what flavor she was. Mason responded, “I am mocha spice.”
Diggs and Evans said that they are unfazed by criticism they have received for simplifying race to ice cream flavors.
“One thing you can count on is the motherfuckers trying to bring you down,” Diggs said.
Diggs and Evans have been friends since their sophomore year of high school, when they met at the School of the Arts in Rochester, New York.
Diggs said that the text of the book was a poem that he originally composed while studying at Syracuse University, where Evans also attended.
The two said they hope to work on more books together. Diggs said that he would like to collaborate with Evans on a book that focuses on biracial children. Both have children from biracial marriages.
Those in attendance said they were excited that the book allowed children to enter into the discussion of race.
Adero-Zaire R. Green attended the event with her preschool-aged daughter Summer.
“Today’s lecture really solidified a lot of the questions I have as a parent,” she said.
Green said she considered the book an effective tool for discussing race. “It opened up a lot of doors,” she said.
Dorice Moise, a graduate of the Ed School, said she was excited to see a black child as the protagonist of a children’s book.
“Just walking into a library, how many books are you going to see with a black child on the cover?” Moise said. “I’m gonna read it to my child.”

Mass. House Representative Barnett “Barney” Frank  ’61-’62 and comedian Andy Samberg will speak at Class Day as the guest alumni speaker and the guest speaker, respectively, according to a video message sent to some seniors by the Senior Class Committee earlier today.
This is the first time that Class Day will feature two guest speakers.
“We are excited to bring an alum of the College to Class Day as a way to cap off the year long celebration of Harvard’s 375th anniversary,” Class Marshal Matthew J. DaSilva ’12 said.
Frank, who represents the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts and serves as the Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee, began his political career in the Massachusetts State House before he won a seat in the U.S. Congress in 1980.  He is known for his work on national issues, such as helping to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as on local issues, such as providing affordable rental housing and supporting local organizations and businesses.
Samberg, currently in his seventh season as a cast member of Saturday Night Live, has demonstrated his talent in writing, singing, and acting on the show. Samberg has won a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics and will be next seen in the film, “That’s My Boy,” with Adam Sandler. Samberg’s other films include “Friends With Benefits,” “I Love You Man,” and “Hot Rod.”
First Class Marshal Bonnie Cao ’12 said the speakers were chosen after taking into consideration the results from a survey sent out to the senior class.
“I think they both represent iconic voices that have defined our generation in different ways—Samberg through his humor, and Frank through his leadership and bravery, regardless of how you might feel about his politics,” Cao said.
The ceremony will also include the traditional Ivy and Harvard orations, as well as remarks from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. The student speakers have not yet been announced.

Mother Earth, the largest of the Russian bells that hangs in Lowell House’s belltower, weighs about 13 tons. But despite its weight, Father Roman Ogrzykov, the head bellringer at the Danilov Monastery in Moscow, manipulated the device with ease on Wednesday afternoon, quickly tolling the three quick strokes that ended that afternoon’s bellringing session.
Ogryzkov, a tall, bearded man dressed in traditional Russian Orthodox garments, was one of two Russian monks who visited Harvard this past week. Along with Father Pavel Radin, who was clad in a checkered vest, linen shirt, and paisley ascot, Ogryzkov taught a series of master classes for the Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers, a small student group that rings the bells every Sunday.
“This is a time for us to hone our skills with the traditional peals,” co-president Ivan D. Bochkov ’12 said.
According to co-president Inna Ryzhik ’12, the two monks taught three different peals. In addition, Radin, a monk from St. Petersburg, gifted the group a book of notated peals that he had compiled.
Though this was Radin’s first visit to Harvard, Ogryzkov has maintained a relationship with the University since 2003, when a delegation of Russian governmental and Orthodox Church officials came to Harvard to discuss the return of the historic bells, which had rested in Lowell House since 1930. The set, one of the few that survived the atheist regime of Joseph Stalin, was played by Ogryzkov during that trip.
“To a great extent, he enabled people to hear what those bells sound like when rung in the proper way,” Lowell House Co-Master Diana L. Eck said.
Though it was decided that the bells were to be returned and that Lowell House would receive a set of newly cast bells, Ogryzkov remained a friend of the University. According to Eck, when a delegation of Harvard officials went to Russia to find a bell foundry, Ogrzykov accompanied them. When the new bells were placed in Lowell in 2008, he taught a master class to several students and gave a bells concert.
“Since then, we’ve tried to maintain contact so we have some kind of program where our bellringers can travel to Russia every other year to learn more about the culture an practice of bellringing, and Father Roman comes here on the off years to teach master classes,” Eck said.
The monk has left a literal imprint on the Lowell Bells—during the Wednesday master class, he pointed out that his signature can be seen on the inside of Mother Earth.
“I participated in installing it,” he explained proudly. According to Ryzhik, the lessons, in conjunction with the trips, have also left a lasting impact.
“We improvised things, but we didn’t have a set canon of traditional peals,” she said.
Eck agreed that these elements have improved the sound of the bells. “Just in this week, the difference of hearing the complexity of the bells is really powerful,” she said.
Ryzhik encouraged all Harvard students to explore the bells, noting their uniqueness.
“Harvard is the only university with a set of Russian bells,” Ryzhik said. “We are trying to incorporate more traditional peals, but there’s always room for fun and improvisation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard freshman will serve as chair of the Massachusetts Alliance of College Republicans, a student organization that aims to spread the ideas of the Republican Party.
Joshua S. Chmara ’15 was elected at the end of April during the MACR’s annual spring convention—making him the youngest student to lead a statewide college Republican organization in the nation right now, he said. Chmara said he looks forward to inciting excitement about politics and political campaigns among Bay State college students.
“What I really want to see is college Republicans across the state be excited to be college Republicans,” Chmara said, pointing to the large college student population in Boston as evidence that students can have a major impact in politics. “I want them to be excited to be a part of the state-wide organization.”
One of the biggest changes Chmara plans to make is allocating funds to fledgling Republican clubs. Under his plan, clubs would earn dollars by participating in political activities such as campaigning.
Chmara described developing a sense of camaraderie as one of the keys to boosting interest in campaigns. To that end, he said he plans to organize group events such as a state-wide outdoor barbeque.
“I think this is a year where we can truly rebuild the organization,” Chmara said.
While the MACR does not openly endorse candidates, Chmara said that members help out on many Republican campaigns. Currently, the MACR is pushing for Republicans to be elected on the local, state, and national level.
Chmara said members are concentrating manpower on U.S. Senator Scott Brown’s campaign for reelection by participating in phone banks to drum up votes. He said he hopes to get students interested in helping with Mitt Romeny’s campaign for presidency as well as the campaign of Richard Tisei, who is running for Congress in the Massachusetts Sixth District.
“We can be a very powerful voice in Massachusetts,” Chmara said. “The organization needs someone who can bring all the different chapters together, and I think I can do that.”

Eighty-one students won Harvard’s highest honor for undergraduate writing, the Hoopes Prize, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday.
The prize, which is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes ’19, was awarded to students from a wide variety of concentrations, “on the basis of outstanding scholarly work or research,” according to the Prize’s iSite. Instructors nominate students’ projects for the prestigious honor during the first half of the semester.
“I was very surprised and I was really grateful.” said Chase W. Hu ’12, an awardee whose project was titled “Tracing the American Dream: A Quantitative Approach to Attitudes.” Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor, said that he had all of the friends, professors, and classmates who had taken the time to look at pieces of his thesis to thank.
Maya E. Pena ’12, a history concentrator who won the prize for her project called “A Cup and A Half of Health: This History of Flour Enrichment in the United States 1910-1955,” said that she was “incredibly surprised” upon hearing that she had won.
“I knew a lot of really wonderful projects were nominated this year,” Pena said.
She said that since she plans to join the Teach for America corps next year and likely go to medical school afterward, the prize nicely caps off her academic focus on history.
“It’s a really wonderful form of validation for my time at Harvard,” Pena said. “I think this will be a nice thing to carry with me into the future.”
Hoopes, who was the curator of St. Louis’ City Art Museum for more than 25 years, intended for his prize to help fulfill the mission of “promoting, improving, and enhancing the quality of education...in literary, artistic, musical, scientific, historical or other academic subjects made part of the College curriculum under the faculty supervision and instruction,” according to the Hoopes Prize’s iSite.
The other winners of this year’s Hoopes Prize were Marc F. Aidinoff ’12, Sarah Akhtar ’12, Ross P. Anderson ’12, Matthew A. Aucoin ’12, Tarek J. Austin ’12, Shika Card ’12, Caitlin E.

Samuel “DJ Shiftee” M. Zornow ’08—considered by many to be one of the best disc jockeys in the world—and bass player and music producer Daniel F. Freeman ’05 argued that new digital music technology has revolutionized what it means to be a DJ and created a new DJ culture.
The two music professionals hosted a talk as well as a DJing and production workshop at the Science Center on Thursday sponsored by Quad Sound Studios, a Harvard student group dedicated to music recording and production of which Freeman is an alumnus.
Zornow said that new music technology has allowed DJs to “interact with music in a way we were never able to do before.”
“We can push our music further now,” Zornow said. “We can really push what it means to be a DJ and play with that definition a lot more than we could before.”
Zornow rejected suggestions that technology has taken the “skill out of DJing.”
“Sure, it does make things easier, but you still have to know how to use these tools, how to read the crowd, how to produce the energy,” Zornow said. “It’s not cheating, because you’re doing a bunch of crazy stuff on top that would be impossible otherwise. And with new technology, DJs have way more authorship over their own tracks.”
Freeman said that new technology has made music production more accessible to a wide range of people.
“People around the world now have access to the same musical tools,” Freeman said. “What separates them is knowledge and dedication.”
Arnold “Chip” B. Peinado ’12, a co-president of Quad Sound Studios who organized the event, praised the fact that students like himself who are considering a career in music had the chance to meet major figures in the realm of DJing and electronic music production.
“I think this is a really exciting opportunity, especially for students who are interested in entering the music business,” Peinado said. “It’s really important to hear from people who are doing well in the industry.”
Students who attended the event said that they found the workshop informative.
“I really came because I wanted to learn more about the technological side of music production,” said Ashley D. Jamerson ’15, a songwriter who is contemplating a career in the music business. “I feel like I know a lot more about the technology that goes into music to make it sound like it sounds.”
Benjamin L. Sobel ’15, who said he came primarily to learn more about how new technology affects live performances, said that he was impressed by the speakers’ presentations.
“I thought what they said about the technology was really cool,” Sobel said.

Winthrop House tutor Luke A. Leafgren will serve as the next resident dean of Mather House.
Leafgren was selected from a competitive pool of applicants who were interviewed by several deans, Mather’s House Masters, House staff, tutors, and students.
Leafgren has been a tutor at Winthrop House for six years and served as interim resident dean of the House last fall while Resident Dean Gregg A. Peeples was on sabbatical.
“That experience helped me get a good sense of the challenges and the satisfaction that come with this role,” Leafgren said.
He said he anticipates that as resident dean, he will have a busier schedule filled with more meetings than he has had as a tutor. “But spending as much time as possible in the dining hall and at student events will remain a priority,” he said.
Leafgren described the job as “perfect” for him because it combines working closely with the student community and pursuing his interest in academia.
“My life is richer because of my work with Harvard undergraduates, and I’m glad that I can continue doing that while making an increased contribution in the role of resident dean,” he said.
Leafgren, who is completing his doctorate in comparative literature this year, received a B.A. in English from Columbia University and a second B.A. in Philosophy and Theology from Oxford University. He specializes in Arabic but said he can read about 10 different languages.
Although Leafgren said he will miss the Winthrop community, he added that he is excited to build new relationship with people in Mather House.
“I also can’t wait to enjoy the views of the river from the Mather dining hall,” he said. “I’m ready to make Mather my home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is the best at many things. But despite the Crimson’s pedigree we must recognize when we’ve been beaten. Princeton paces the Ivy League with over 50 more championships all-time than second-place Harvard, including a conference record 15 titles in 2010-11.
No matter. As long as Harvard’s athletic programs continue to improve at their current rate, we may just catch them yet.
In the meantime, we can entertain ourselves with a look at the worst the Ivy League has to offer: The Columbia Lions.
If not for capturing the women’s track and field Indoor Heptagonal Championship, Columbia would have made it two years in a row getting blanked in the title department. All-time, the Lions stand at 87 total championships. To give some perspective, the Crimson reached that number in 1972.
The main reason for this futility is the school’s location in the middle of Manhattan. If athletes here think walking across the river for practice is bad, try a five-mile bus ride through New York traffic. Naturally, this makes for problems in recruiting and preparation, but we’re not here to make excuses for Columbia; we’re here to make us feel better about ourselves by having a chuckle at the Lions’ expense.
Let’s leave history behind, and try and look at the 2011-12 sports year in a vacuum.
Columbia football went 1-9 last season, with its only win coming in the final weekend of the year in double overtime against Brown. The Lions got blanked, 37-0, by a Dartmouth team that lost to Harvard and Yale by a combined 71-10. Ouch.
Despite taking the champion Crimson to overtime in the last weekend of the season (noticing a trend here?) the men’s basketball team finished 4-10 in the Ancient Eight last season, and two of those wins came against the Big Green, which shouldn’t really count.
Not to be outdone by the men, Columbia's women’s basketball team went 1-13 in conference, losing both games to eventual champion Princeton by a combined 99 points, leading the five students in the stands to walk home thinking about what could have been if they’d just made 50 more shots.
They’re even bad at squash. Columbia didn’t take a single game against Harvard, Dartmouth or Yale on the men’s side, nor Princeton, Penn, Cornell, the Bulldogs or the Crimson on the women’s side. They play nine games a match in Ivy squash.
The women’s lacrosse team turned their noses up at the squash program, and defiantly said, “we’ll do you one better.” En route to a 0-7 record in the Ancient Eight, the Lions’ got outscored 108-47. Damn.
Maybe we’re being too harsh, but when things have gotten so bad that your own student newspaper thinks it might be a better idea to just stop recruiting athletes altogether, I’d say the Athletic Department has some work to do.
But don’t worry guys, I’m sure you’ll get ‘em next year.

These days, Tom Thibodeau is best known for leading the Chicago Bulls to the NBA’s best regular-season record in the 2011-2012 season. Or for winning Coach of the Year in 2010-2011. But what many may not know is that before the fame and glory of the NBA, Thibodeau once coached at a New England school that definitely was not known for its basketball team: Harvard.
Thibodeau was hired as the Crimson’s assistant coach in 1985. That year, Harvard didn’t quite live up to the Bulls’ 50-16 record. In fact, the Crimson went 6-20 and recorded only two wins in Ivy play. But the team slightly improved in the four seasons that Thibodeau was with them—in his final year with the ball club, Thibodeau and Co. went 11-15 and hit .500 in Ivies with a 7-7 record.
In 1989, Thibodeau was hired as an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves, the NBA’s then-newest expansion team. From there, his journey through a number of professional teams began. In 2007, he returned to Massachusetts as an assistant for the Boston Celtics, where, only the following year, he won the NBA title. And, finally, in 2010, he was given the opportunity to take over as head coach for the Chicago Bulls.
With regard to this year’s Linsanity, Thibodeau gave some Crimson-tinted analysis to the media.
“It's interesting because I coached at Harvard a long time ago,” Thibodeau said. “And a number of players there had told me about him during his career, and of course coaching in Boston I sort of followed him a little bit. It is an amazing story, and he's done an incredible job, so I'm happy for him.”
Thibodeau can relate to Lin on one other point—knee injuries. Though Lin is making progress towards coming back from his torn MCL in the coming weeks, the return of last season’s MVP—Bulls point guard Derrick Rose—will not be quite as soon. Rose fell in the Bulls’ post-season opener on Saturday with a torn ACL.
But, if he was able to survive the 6-20 seasons with Harvard, Thibodeau shouldn’t have much trouble making the best of a Rose-less Chicago squad. After all, with Lin out for the time being, the NBA needs another Harvard basketball alum to shake things up and create some drama. With Linsanity gone, let the Thibodeau puns begin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It all comes down to this weekend.
After countless hours of training and 15 tune-up invitationals, the Harvard track and field team has finally reached the most important meet of its outdoor season: the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships.
Penn will host this year’s edition of “Heps”—track and field’s version of an Ivy League Championship meet—at its historic Franklin Field in Philadelphia. The Crimson is looking to improve upon its performance at the Indoor Heptagonal Championships, where the men’s and women’s squads both finished in fourth place.
“A lot of people see Heps as this big, end-all, be-all of the season, and they get nervous,” said sophomore middle distance runner Alaina Murphy. “As a team, we’re working on walking in there and feeling like we belong.”
On the men’s side, Princeton was dominant at Indoor Heps, racking up 184 points en route to the team championship. For Harvard to put up the number of points that it will take to compete with the Tigers this weekend, its key contributors will need to rise to the occasion in their respective events.
Junior Nico Weiler is expected to battle Princeton’s David Slovenski for the men’s pole vault title. Slovenski and Weiler have proven themselves to be of a separate caliber from the rest of the Ancient Eight field. And though Weiler has dominated the rivalry as of late—including a victory at Indoor Heps, where he cleared a mark 0.10 meters higher than Slovenski—the Tigers senior will look to upset Weiler in his final Ivy League competition.
On the track, Princeton’s distance runners have long been the class of the Ivy League. Seniors Donn Cabral and Joe Stilin picked up a combined 32 points for the Tigers—more than half of Harvard’s total—at Indoor Heps. The Crimson’s distance runners will have their hands full as they toe the line next to Princeton’s veteran harriers.
“I’m happy with some of the things that we’re doing to close the gap with Princeton,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.  “They clearly have a great history and tradition [in distance running], but we’re looking to build one of our own.”
Should the squad’s distance runners come up short, the team will look to a pair of throwers to tally key points in this weekend’s competition: freshman Ben Glauser and sophomore Dustin Brode.
A valuable one-two punch for the team this outdoor season, both Glauser and Brode delivered some of the best performances of their collegiate careers a week ago at the Penn Relays.
Brode earned one of Harvard’s only event wins against the deep field at the Relays in the shot put with an impressive 17.62-meter hurl. The sophomore took home first place at last year’s outdoor Heps by recording his personal-best throw of 17.65 meters.
“I’ve been trying to hit a [personal record] for a year now,” said Brode, who will also compete in the hammer throw and discus this weekend. “It’s about time I hit another one.”
And though Brode has come on as of late, it was Glauser who owned the day at this year’s indoor championship meet. The rookie edged Cornell freshman Stephen Mozia with a mark of 17.95 meters to earn the event win. If Glauser and Brode are at top form this weekend, they could pick up 18 crucial team points for the Crimson in the shot put.
Harvard’s female throwers will be equally important in determining the success of the women’s squad this weekend. Sophomore Adabelle Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and photography editor, is expected to earn 10 team points for Harvard by repeating as Ivy League champion in the weight throw.
“[Our throwers] are the rock and foundation of our team,” Saretsky said. “And I expect that to continue. I know that they’re all fired up and looking forward to the competition.”
The recent success of the Crimson’s 4x800 meter relay team is an encouraging sign heading into Heps. The team of Murphy and classmate Natalia Paine, freshman Erika Veidis, and senior Meg Looney earned an event win at the Penn Relays with a time of 8:53.95. If the foursome can repeat the strong showing, it will improve upon its sixth-place finish at Indoor Heps and earn valuable team points for the Crimson.
“I’m really excited for that race,” Murphy said. “We expect to compete to win….There are a lot of teams that have really tough 4x8’s, but I definitely don’t think anyone is counting us out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 10, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team appeared poised to accomplish a feat no Crimson team had in more than a decade. With 16:23 to play, Harvard held what appeared to be a comfortable 10-5 lead over then-No. 9/10 Penn, a foe no Crimson squad had bested since 2000.
But in the final 15 minutes of play, Harvard’s lead evaporated. The Quakers reeled off four straight scores in less than five minutes to pull within one, and then evened the score with 1:06 to go to force overtime. In the extra period, Penn squeaked out a one-goal win.
“Not meaning to sound dramatic, but that was probably on the most disappointing results I can remember,” said co-captain Melanie Baskind following the 14-13 loss.
On Friday night, the Crimson will get another crack at the Quakers.
Playing in the Ivy League Tournament for the second straight season, fourth-seeded Harvard (9-6, 5-2 Ivy) will take on top-seeded Penn (8-6, 6-1) in Philadelphia in the tournament’s opening round. The victor will go on to play for the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament on Sunday against the winner of the other first-round matchup between No. 2 seed Dartmouth and No. 3 seed Cornell.
But getting past the Quakers—currently ranked No. 9 in the IWLCA poll—will be no easy task.
“I think we are going in knowing that it is going to be a fight, and we are ready to bring our best,” junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault said. “At this point…your season is on the line every game you play, and I know we are not ready for it to be our last.”
The six-time defending Ivy League champions, Penn enters Friday’s matchup boasting a talented lineup that features three of the 11 members of the 2012 First-Team All Ivy.
Receiving the honor for the third straight season was senior attack Erin Brennan. Penn’s leading scorer in 2011, Brennan has continued to be the focal point of the Quakers’ offense in her final season, tallying a team-high 29 goals and 23 assists through 14 games. Brennan proved to be a problem for the Crimson defense in March when she finished three of six shots—including the first goal of overtime—and dished out an assist.
Joining Brennan on the First-Team All Ivy was junior midfielder Maddie Poplawski. In her third season as a starter, Poplawski has gotten it done on both sides of the field, finishing the regular season first on the Quakers in draw controls, second in ground balls and caused turnovers, and third in goals.
The Quakers’ final first-team selection was senior goalkeeper Emily Leitner, who is second in the Ancient Eight in ground balls per game and fourth in saves and goals allowed.
Penn enters Friday’s contest coming off a 12-5 loss to No. 7 Duke and its worst offensive performance of the year. Harvard, on the other hand, is currently riding a five-game winning streak, its most recent victory coming over No. 10 Dartmouth last Friday.
Crucial to the Crimson’s success has been the play of its defense, which has limited its past five opponents to 5.4 goals per game. Harvard is currently ranked fifth in the nation in scoring defense, allowing just 7.58 per game, nearly three scores below its 2011 average.
Rookie goalkeeper Kelly Weis can take some of the credit for Harvard’s improvement on the defensive side. Weis, who has started in the cage since game one, has come into her own of late, stopping more than half of the shots she’s faced in three of her last four games. The rookie is currently tops in the Ivy League in both goals allowed and save percentage, and is ranked 11th in the nation in the latter category.
Harvard’s offense, which had trouble gelling in the early portion of the season, is also starting to come together at the right time. After a five-game stretch midway through the season in which the Crimson reached double-figures just once, Harvard has since put up at least 10 goals in four of its last five matchups.
Leading the way for the Crimson has been the trio of Baskind, Tetreault, and junior Jennifer VanderMeulen, who have combined for 79 of Harvard’s 133 goals on the year.
“A lot of things have come together for us in the last couple weeks, and we are looking to continue with this success moving forward,” Tetreault said.
If the Crimson’s offense and defense continue on their current trajectories, then the Crimson might just be able to finish the job it couldn’t last March—and earn a bid to the Ivy League championship in the process.

59 JFK Street is now home to the newest restaurant in Harvard Square: Park Restaurant & Bar. Park, which opened on April 11, offers a friendly neighborhood bar and restaurant that serves home-style American cuisine in an elegantly trendy yet informal atmosphere.
Park's menu features a half baked-chicken so big that it looks like a full chicken and a selection of burgers and sandwiches served beside mountains of thin, crispy fries; perhaps the most unique item on the menu is the Meat Pie of the Day.
"The Meat Pie keeps us creative," said Park's Executive Chef Mark Goldberg. "We haven’t repeated a meat pie yet." Entrées on Park's menu range between $9 and $23 and include a few vegetarian options.
A faded globe, a rusting old-school sewing machine, and a rotary dial telephone are a few of the artifact-decorations lining Park's walls. Designed by Peter Niemitz, Park's interior also features pleasant lighting, with bulbs and lamps of all varieties illuminating the restaurant's interlocking nooks and rooms. With its leather armchairs and black-framed pictures on the walls, the restaurant maintains a quirky but warm vibe.
Park replaces Redline, a nightclub that closed its doors to the public earlier this year. Both Park and its predecessor Redline are part of The Grafton Group, which owns and operates other restaurants in Harvard Square including Russell House Tavern and Grafton Street.

If you're looking to take a study break after spending days and days in Lamont, check out Crimson Compliments, the latest Harvard-student created website by Seth A. Riddley '12.
 
 
 
"It's a Facebook page that allows Harvard students to post anonymous compliments to their friends," Barr Yaron '14, one of the site's co-administrators, explained.
Riddley was inspired to create Crimson Compliments after viewing a similar page for students at The College of William and Mary. Riddley then launched the page on Thursday night. Already, it has over 200 Facebook friends and has been referenced on websites like "I Saw You Harvard."

 
 
"I think that people are responding to it really positively. Somebody sent me a message, and she said that she had just been complaining about how Harvard students were mean to each other, and that this was changing her mind," Riddley said.
  
The Facebook page's dozens of posts range in subject matter from p-sets to roommates. Already having received an anonymous compliment, Ting-Ting Liu '15 said, "It exponentially brightened my mood. Whoever left me the compliment had perfect timing, and I thank him/her for the wonderful surprise, as well as for making me smile."
If you feel like sending an anonymous note to someone that deserves thanks, go ahead and message Crimson Compliments on Facebook—remember that anonymity is guaranteed to all users. As Riddley puts it, "Everyone likes getting compliments. If you see a compliment saying something nice about you, it has a positive impact."
  
 
With finals, papers, and summer plans filling everyone's minds, the goal of Crimson Compliments is to brighten the days Harvard students, as it's easy to feel overwhelmed.
 
 
"It's about spreading a little bit of cheer to Harvard, which is generally a happy place, but it's also intense," Yaron said. "It's nice to take a step back and tell people that you appreciate them and that they are important to you in some way."
