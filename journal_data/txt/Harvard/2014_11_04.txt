After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tucked within Harvard’s Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts is a small space Susannah Maybank ’15 calls her own. Equipped with a sewing machine and yards of fabric, the nook comprises one section of a larger common space that the students and faculty within the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies use for a myriad of creative purposes. For Maybank, an aspiring fashion designer, this makeshift studio serves as the site where her imagined creations spring from paper to life.
Maybank is just one member of a scattered cohort of students at the College who aspire to work after graduation in fashion, a field not often found on the résumés of Harvard alumni. These students’ media are varied—some are style bloggers; some are working on fashion-based startups; some, like Maybank, are designers—as are their future career aspirations within the industry, which run the gamut from independent designer to marketing executive. Yet all remain sure of one fact: they love fashion, and somehow, someday, they will find a way to work with it.
But many have found that Harvard itself—with the absence of fashion-related courses and scarce resources for designers—can make it difficult for them to prepare for their future career.
SLIM PICKINGS
Studies of textiles and fashion design have not been within Harvard’s academic domain in the past, which has been understandable given the inherent difference between the field’s vocational background and the University’s focus on liberal arts. But as the college admissions process has expanded to encompass those with more diverse interests and backgrounds, other schools of similar origins have begun to create opportunities for those who wish to work in fashion.Students at Brown University, for example, have the option of taking classes like “Tailoring” and “Introduction to Apparel” via cross-registration with the Rhode Island School of Design, through which they are given the opportunity to work on their own time with a wide range of clothing production equipment, including sewing machines, knitting machines, and buttonholers. A select few are even able to earn degrees in apparel design through the Brown-RISD dual-degree program, graduating in five years with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the former and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the latter.
Similar opportunities exist for Cornell University students in the Department of Fiber Science and Apparel Design at Cornell’s College of Human Ecology, which offers its students undergraduate degrees in fashion design, fashion design management, or fiber science. In addition to completing classes such as “Fashion Draping” and “Fibers, Fabrics, and Finishes,” fashion students have access to Cornell’s apparel design studios, which contain industry-grade equipment for apparel-making items such as sewing machines, sergers, and, interestingly, full-body scanners. Students are further aided in establishing connections with key players in the fashion industry through the Cornell Institute of Fashion and Fiber Innovation, the mission of which is to “foster collaborations between academia and industry in…fashion design.”
Harvard, meanwhile, has yet to embrace fashion design in its academic curriculum. Maybank was given use of her Carpenter Center studio space courtesy of a VES class in which she is currently enrolled—VES 15ar: “Silkscreen”—but the class is the only studio course that the department is offering in the 2014-2015 academic year to use fabric as its medium. “Although we do have an incredible VES Department, and we have so many opportunities, there’s very little opportunity, I feel, for [fashion] design,” says Haylee Smith ’17, an executive producer for the campus fashion show Eleganza. “And that’s something I know a lot of fashion people on campus have a problem with.”Caroline B. Hubbard ’17, an inactive Crimson Arts editor who runs a style blog and Instagram account by the name “ThreadBred,” agrees with Smith. “It’s an interesting thing because a couple of years ago Harvard put a really strong emphasis on the arts…but I feel like ‘arts’ is really limited to theater and drama in particular. I feel that it should be expanded to include fashion,” Hubbard says. “There are a lot of people here who are interested in fashion, and they feel restricted because there’s not really a foundational support for them.”
At the same time, speaking on the VES Department’s involvement in fashion, VES Director of Administration Denise Oberdan is careful to draw the distinction between fashion and fabric-based art. “Fashion is not really on the horizon [for VES],” she says. “That doesn’t mean our courses don’t use all sorts of media, including fabric.”
The absence of institutional support has driven Hubbard to enroll over January Term in a fashion course in Florence for the basic skills and training needed to work in styling and brand image, as she hopes to do in the future. “[Harvard’s scarce resources] make it harder to know the fundamentals,” she says. “That’s why I’m reaching outside of Harvard, taking classes elsewhere.”
WORLDS COLLIDE 
The prevailing attitude among these students is that a Harvard degree holds little worth in an industry that is driven by individual creativity and personal connections, as opposed to academic credentials. This reality of the fashion world seems responsible for the resignation that some students hold regarding their futures there. “The fashion industry doesn’t care where you went to school,” says Mirel Baysal ’17, a former Vogue intern who specializes in jewelry design. “It’s purely a hard work- and creativity-based industry.”
Her view is one shared by Lilian Zhu ’17, who started her own swimwear line in high school and continues to design her own clothing while at Harvard. “[Fashion] is definitely a world where a Harvard education does not insert you higher than anybody from any other college,” she says. “You start from the bottom no matter where you’re from…. It is something that has that hierarchy.”
Rather than climb through the ranks of such a hierarchy, these would-be fashionistas often feel compelled to instead direct their energies toward industries where their Harvard degree will aid them in securing employment. Many sources suggest that these fields often encompass subjects like finance or computer science, due to what these students perceive to be a Harvard culture. Asked whether she will continue designing after graduation, Zhu, for instance, replies, “Maybe, but the Harvard pressure to find a finance job straight away—I would love to take a year off and design things, but who’s going to pay for that?”
“[Harvard] is a challenge and a blessing,” reflects Lilly Shen ’17, a computer science concentrator who designs clothing in her free time. She adds, “I feel like you’re exposed to a lot of the other skills you need, more on the business side or the technical side…but I feel like there’s this huge pressure to go do something like finance or computer science [after graduation].”
Zhu’s and Shen’s qualms appear to be rooted in a deeper insecurity—namely, that fashion design as a career does not provide nearly as comfortable a monetary cushion as does, say, a position in the leveraged buyout industry. Such questions of financial stability often play a role in pushing students, whatever their interests, away from their pursuits of choice and towards pre-established career paths that are essentially guaranteed salaries upwards of six figures, circumstances to which Shen alluded as she joked of participating in fashion “later [in my career], after I’m not going to be…on the street.”
“Fashion was always something I loved but never thought was practical,” Yasmeen E. Audi ’15 agrees. “It was never something I thought I could pursue as a job.” A summer internship in the buying department of Saks Fifth Avenue, however, allowed her to resolve this conflict, and indeed, many students have found compromise in such positions in the business and marketing side of fashion that place them in a more comfortable financial situation while keeping them involved in the world about which they are passionate.
Audi said she feels that Harvard better prepares its students for these types of jobs relative to design: “I definitely felt like I was able to use my analytical skills and communication skills and ability to get to know people, which is such a huge deal here [at Harvard].”
OUT OF PLACE
Yet even the business side of fashion often finds itself out of place within the Harvard establishment. Last year, Zhu and Kate S. Hoffman ’17 co-founded the startup Revel, which aims to create a platform through which Harvard students can collectively pool and lend one another items from their wardrobes to allow each student access to a larger selection of clothing for formal events or parties. The two have submitted their plans for Revel to a number of Harvard-sponsored competitions, among them the Harvard Innovation Lab’s fall venture residency and the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business Innovation Challenge—but funding and support, they say, have been hard to come by.
Some of their difficulties, they claim, may be due to a tendency to trivialize the startup because of its association with fashion. Hoffman says, “I was explaining Revel to the people who worked at the i-lab, and I had made a small comment about how I didn’t know if my startup fit in [the Residency program]. And they really just loved that—they were like, ‘Yeah, this probably isn’t the place for fashion.’”
Hoffman’s is a sentiment oft echoed by her peers. “I think that at Harvard people tend to think of fashion as sort of a joke or not a serious thing,” says Lena K. Felton ’17, a Fifteen Minutes Magazine editor and one of the executive producers of the Identities fashion show. “I don’t think that fashion as a career or an art form is very present [here], and I don’t think people take it as seriously.” Hubbard elaborates further on the same line of reasoning, explaining, “To be honest, I think people think [fashion] is pretty superfluous, and it’s not important, and it’s superficial, [whereas] Harvard is a very serious institution, and it’s very rooted in the traditional careers.”
What Hubbard calls the “traditional careers” refers, of course, to the conventional, stable, and well-supported positions in politics, academia, and industry that many Harvard graduates pursue. Those who wish to pursue careers in fashion, on the other hand, have been left in large part to fend for themselves, outside the sheltering arms of the academic system.
YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTION 
Where, then, can students interested in working in fashion professionally turn for help? Extracurricular student organizations might be one answer. Felton, speaking in her role as an executive producer of Identities, says, “Identities attracts a lot of people who are interested in working in fashion later on because there aren’t any academic outlets, really, for that. So people who are interested in fashion tend to look for extracurriculars.”
These organizations provide some support, particularly for those who are interested in the management and logistics of fashion—but they are insufficient to meet the needs of those who gravitate toward design. Although the stylists responsible for arranging Eleganza’s runway looks are indeed students, neither Eleganza nor Identities currently showcases student design work, instead drawing on the œuvre of established designers for their annual shows. “It’s a lot of work [for students] to actually make the clothes and showcase them,” Smith adds, speaking for Eleganza. “We don’t have the money to spend on that, since we’re a charity. So we mostly try to get outside stuff.”
But all that is about to change: Maybank and Felton, as co-executive producers of Identities, have decided that they want to begin integrating student work into the show. “In the past, the show has been more about showcasing really prominent designers and getting a lot of big names,” Felton says. “And while we’re still interested in that, we’re actually going to try to get student designers and recent grads [this year].”
“I want to stress that fashion is not just an external thing. It is created, and it exists and grows here on campus as well,” Maybank adds. “I really want to encourage more student exploration of their own personal and individual style. So I think having student designers would show people that there are people on campus who are very interested in that.”
Such a modification to the Identities lineup would be beneficial for student designers in giving them a chance to exhibit their work. In addition, although students usually lack the space and materials to pursue their creations, Maybank has indicated herself willing to provide those means. The limitations in resources are perhaps the most significant factor in the inability of these students to pursue their creations, as Maybank’s Carpenter Center abode is unknown to the majority of her peers. Zhu also cites an ill-fated visit to Harvard’s Office for the Arts (“They were like, ‘No, we don’t have space for a sewing machine!’”) as evidence of the obstacles most designers face in obtaining the supplies they need.
“If money wasn’t a factor, if resources were provided, I would be making swimwear. I would be making clothing,” Zhu says. But according to Maybank, if Identities begins to accept student designers within its ranks, then money is indeed no object; resources will be provided. The swimwear, one presumes, will follow.
A BIGGER VISION
For some prospective designers, the difficulties resulting from such experiences at Harvard can prove discouraging to their fashion aspirations, particularly given the wealth of other academic and professional opportunities available to them at the College.
“I wonder if there are people who are still so creative, or [if fashion] still means so much to them—but the fact that you’re here means that you look at the bigger picture. You’re not just like, ‘This is my dream....’People have bigger visions, I guess,” Zhu muses.
Her words may ring true for some. But for others, it may have taken the very challenges they’ve faced at Harvard to bring them to the realization that those bigger visions are ones in which fashion is inextricably interwoven.
“I never thought of it as a very viable career option because I didn’t know anyone who was in fashion,” Maybank says. “[But Harvard] taught me that I really wanted it—because I kept fighting to find it in my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many novels attempt to take the reader to uncharted lands with varying degrees of success. In Lydia Millet’s “Mermaids in Paradise,” the destination is a fictional Caribbean island that is home to mystical creatures, cynical narrators, and comical hijinks. This combination initially promises an amusing read with a pinch of thought. However, when a newlywed couple’s honeymoon becomes hindered by a marine biologist’s discovery of mermaids and her subsequent death, the couple tries to prevent corporate power from capitalizing on the mermaids. The results are surprising—both for the characters and the reader. For the characters, the tropical resort slowly morphs into a poor vacation choice, and similarly “Mermaids in Paradise” transports the reader away from the originally promised literary paradise to a confusing land of overdone antics and lost potential.
Originally the novel has the formula for a successful tropical escape that moves beyond most stories of its kind. A Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel “Love in Infant Monkeys,” Millet is no amateur, and the set-up for her latest novel proves that much. While erring towards the typical honeymoon-romance genre at first, the plot quickly subverts initial expectations: marine biologist Nancy’s death spurs a murder mystery subplot, while the main characters’ work to save the mermaids’ habitat from becoming a theme park carries tinges of adventure and espionage. The novel’s lack of defined genre has the potential to feel disruptive, but Millet ensures continuity within the novel through her use of wit, which manifests in her narrator, Deb. Critical in a tongue-in-cheek manner, Deb provides the novel with a distinct voice. Rarely do novels describe weddings as “infantile or pedophile” or compare the bride and groom dolls on top of wedding cakes to “a serial killer’s dream of love,” but Millet manages to pack insuch descriptors and many other one-liners tinted by dark comedy.
The humor functions perfectly as a vehicle for Millet’s social commentary. It is caustic but also subtle enough to allow her words to fester in the reader’s mind long after she has moved onto another topic. During the first night of the honeymoon, Deb accidentally plays footsie with another resort guest. After the guest makes a move towards her, she begins wondering if she is at fault for the circumstances: “Are my toes sluts? Were my toes asking for it?” The situation, almost laughable because of its anatomic focus, mirrors that experienced by victimized females, and the episode becomes a profound comment on the absurdity of victim blaming. This scene represents one aspect of Millet’s philosophical and social critique that is carefully hidden behind her narrator’s and plot’s outlandish humor—an aspect of the novel that positions it for excellence.
The problem, however, is that this excellence is not actually achieved. While the portion of the novel leading up to the honeymoon is abrasive and attention grabbing, the novel starts to lose its momentum as soon as Deb and her husband Chip’s tropical honeymoon goes awry. The quickening plot development obscures the finer points of the writing, which once made the novel so compelling. The suggestive diction, the pointed jests, and the blithe social commentary become lost in paragraphs of exposition describing the characters’ actions and plans.
Most notably, the characters, initially promising, lack development and become mere puppets to the plot. Chief among these missed opportunities are Chip, the gamer always searching for adventure akin to the fantasy games he plays, and Gina, Deb’s best friend who loves to be ironic and judgmental. While these personalities could contribute to the novel in meaningful ways, such potential becomes forgotten in favor of the plot. Chip’s fantasy life, placed as a potential source of conflict between him and his wife, is immediately discarded for the conflict between the main characters and the resort. Gina remains only ironic and is never further developed; even a small hint about the past behind her personality does not contribute to fleshing out a fuller character. Furthermore, the number of themes within the novel becomes excessive, until one poignant point is lost in all the various critiques presented. Millet’s social analysis switches from a war between corporate power and environmentalism to a critique of religious fanatics. She employes dei ex machina to wrap up the denouement more easily, and while this at times results in hilarity, other instances, like the sudden appearance of a Japanese superstar on the protagonists’ side, seem too forced. In the end, the plot’s currents prove too strong to allow any other aspect of the novel to flourish.
Perhaps this is the main issue with “Mermaids in Paradise.” Millet attempts to present a work filled with thought, humor, a jam-packed plot, and quirky characters. In her move to put as much as possible into fewer than 300 pages, however, she ends up telling more than showing. Major ideas and revelations by the narrator are suddenly thrown into the reader’s face; this abruptness comes from the lack of advanced development in the ideas and from the overly explicit way the information is presented. Characters are unable to reveal their personalities through their decisions and mistakes; instead, the narrator states everything outright. “I’m not a screamer, never have been,” Deb says to justify why she does not put up a fight when placed in a difficult situation, instead of letting her silence speak volumes for her character—one of many examples where the explicit becomes too much.
Ultimately, “Mermaids in Paradise” is a potentially engaging work that becomes overshadowed by its deficiencies. Throughout the novel, Millet uses humor to capture the imagination and take the reader to an interesting place. “With the planet at seven billion people and counting...my concern is that extreme sports are maybe a red herring. If people want to put so much effort into testing their toughness.why not travel as Good Samaritans to famine-ridden or war-torn countries?” says Deb early in the novel. But in the end, the good within the novel is employed poorly. As a result, the book ends up being too intelligent to be some cliché romance novel, but too convoluted to make any grand commentaries. Instead the reader is transported to some sort of limbo between an intelligent read and an elaborate mess.

Quote: “I wanted to know exactly how much to apologize for.” With these words, Sherlock welcomes himself back into Watson’s life, ushering in the third season of Elementary. And while much has changed, a lot, including Sherlock’s callousness, remains the same.
What to say to your friend who has a love of all things Holmes...
“Elementary” has returned to fill the void. In its season three premiere on Oct. 30, the show jumps through eight months of action, introducing new characters and shifting the hierarchy, as Watson moved away from Sherlock. This low-key premiere continued with an introduction to a new mentee for Sherlock: Kitty, played by Ophelia Lovibond. This season has managed to transform the loose ends left after season two into promising new avenues and storylines in which Watson takes on a larger role, on par with Sherlock. She even has her own Moriarty now: cartel overlord Elena March!
What to say to your friend who’s a superhero buff…
Boy are you in for a good few years! Marvel has just unveiled their nine-movie lineup that goes until 2019. On the docket is a third installment of “Captain America,” which features both Captain America and Iron Man and is ominously subtitled “Civil War.” And just to keep you excited, Marvel also released a new trailer for “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” a film that potentially has too much hype and anticipation surrounding it already. Can it match the success of its predecessor?
The full movie lineup is as follows: “Captain America: Civil War” (May 6, 2016), “Dr. Strange” (Nov. 4, 2016), “Guardians of the Galaxy 2” (May 5, 2017), “Thor: Ragnarok” (July 28, 2017), “Black Panther” (Nov. 3, 2017), “Avengers: Infinity War Part I” (May 4, 2018), “Captain Marvel” (July 6, 2018), “Inhumans” (Nov. 2, 2018), and “Avengers: Infinity War Part II” (May 3, 2019).
What to say to your friends who want a little more action in their lives
“Fast & Furious 7” just released its new trailer. Featuring the late Paul Walker, the movie promises to continue the franchise’s success while remembering their missing cast member. Paul Walker’s brothers worked as his body doubles to help finish the role he began in a fitting tribute.
What to say to your friend who misses HIMYM…
Barney is coming to “American Horror Story”! Or at least the actor who plays him, Neil Patrick Harris, is. Fresh off the rousing success of  “Gone Girl,” Harris and his husband David Burtka will be joining the cast for the last few episodes of season four.
Around Campus
Running until Nov. 8, the play “Dogfight” opened last week at the Loeb Experimental Theater.
Beginning with a bet between a marine and a songwriter, this musical follows the adventures and drama that ensue.
If you’re looking for something with a more dismal outlook, “Three Sisters” might be the play for you. Opening in the Loeb Drama Center Main Stage, this new translation of the Chekhov’s play details the heartbreak and struggles four siblings endure after the death of their father. Thrown into life without any idea of what they want, the three sisters (Masha, Olga, and Irina) embark on adventures with a group of soldiers. It will be on stage from Nov. 7 to 15.
On the more light-hearted side is “Pericles, Prince of Tyre,” which runs at the Adams Pool Theater from Nov. 7 to 9. Boisterous and chaotic, this Shakespearean play follows King Pericles’s battle against fate and its many villians.
Perhaps one of the most exciting plays to come to Harvard this year is “Spring Awakening.” Running from Nov. 14 to Nov. 22, this new translation of the classic play will be performed in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
Finally, “Players” is coming to the Adams Pool Theater from Nov. 14 to 16. This brand-new drama, penned by students, begins in the midst of a hypothetical war that has torn a city apart. When trying to patch things up with his friends, the protagonist, Henry, finds that they are on opposing sides of the war and that it might be too late to turn back to the bygone days.

My a cappella group, the Harvard Opportunes, has a tradition that originates from the group’s founding in the 1980s and continues to appear in all of our performances. While most a cappella traditions are better left unexplained, this particular one provides us with an appropriate starting place for a discussion of some of the reasons why albums have seemingly fallen out of style in the recent history of pop music.
At every concert, the Opportunes pick four or five songs from Billboard’s “Hot 100” list to perform as part of a medley called “Let the Music Play.” The medley is unlike any other, though, in that it samples these top-performing singles (no more than a verse and chorus of each) and injects them into a “frame song”—“Let The Music Play,” a 1983 chart-topper by one-hit-wonder Shannon. The effect is a tribute to pop music of the past and present in the form of a disjointed, disorienting mash-up that always manages to feel like a train about to derail in performance.
The recurrence of this strange tradition, beyond its sentimental qualities, indicates the prevalence of Top 40 singles. The tendency of our society to obsess over individual songs—or, even just a chorus or a single line from them—is evident in my a cappella group’s need to appeal to mass audiences as well as several other phenomena of modern music.
Mainstream artists today are under more pressure than ever to release music in a way that gets them to the top of the charts. While one-hit-wonders were prominent throughout the ’70s and ’80s, performers like Taylor Swift, Sam Smith, and Ariana Grande are trying to make music that repeatedly achieves commercial success as measured by iTunes purchases and playlist prominence. The fact that the average length of a song’s position on Billboard’s tracking charts has increased by more than 50 percent between 1950 and 2010 shows the rate at which current consumers exercise their purchasing power in terms of isolated singles. It also indicates how the music industry plays the system through well-timed releases to coincide with chart turnover. In terms of albums, this means trading off the artistic storyline and ebb and flow for works that are distinctively less cohesive and crafted but have the potential to get more individual songs to the top of the charts.
Take Meghan Trainor. Her debut single,“All About That Bass,” has ranked on Billboard for 16 weeks. Rather than releasing a full-length album, Trainor chose to release another single, “Lips Are Movin,” as well as an extended play (EP) of four songs. These releases, with the possible exception of  “Close Your Eyes,” are all short, sweet, peppy, and relatively simple in terms of music construction. It’s reasonable to say that these songs lack both cohesion and nuance, and with all four EP songs destined to appear on Trainor’s full release in 2015, it’s hard to imagine that her album will fill this artistic void.
But what exactly is fueling these industry and consumer trends? Is it just that, as Bob Dylan wrote, “the times, they are a-changin’”? Have listeners simply made a conscious choice to migrate away from the album as an art form? If change is measured in software upgrades and Apple product releases, one might say yes. On the simplest level, technologies like Spotify (and its random advertisements every few songs), $1.29 iTunes purchases, iPod shuffle mode, and YouTube have all made albums comparatively more expensive and cumbersome while making singles comparatively cheaper and more accessible.
It’s hard to say if these technological and market developments are fueling consumer trends or vice-versa (I’m no economics major). But, it’s easy to see that these changes aren’t the product of conscious choices but instead represent a slow shift in society’s attitude towards music listening.  I am as guilty as anyone when it comes to shutting my mind off and putting Spotify on between classes, during showers, while doing homework, and at social gatherings—in other words, normalizing music as a “background activity,” used to distract from or enhance other activities. While this background function has always been vital to popular music—think of car radios and D.J.s as prime examples—albums and critical listening also held an important place in music consumption. But, in this era of industries hyper-analyzing consumer trends, even subtle or subconscious changes have put the album, as a distinctive art form, down a path towards marginalization.
If we don’t make time for music as more than “background activity,” we may be doomed to a pop genre defined only by a disjointed mess of random lines and choruses. We should seek out artists who can produce both chart-topping singles and more intricate, longer-form inventions. If we don’t, instead of “one-hit wonders,” the charts will be dominated by “one-trick ponies” rather than showcasing the depth of talent that defined the pop stars of yesteryear.

“What I really, really love to do is play chamber music and larger ensembles like orchestra because then it’s a way of communicating with people through music and your instrument, and then performing is great because you’re communicating with the people you’re playing with, but you’re also communicating with the audience.”
A member of Winthrop House and a prospective History of Art and Architecture concentrator, Emma J. Frucht ’17 is a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and the Brattle Street Chamber Players, and she will also be playing in the pit for the Dunster House Opera. Upon arriving at Harvard, she heard about HRO from upperclassmen and through the Office for the Arts. Now in her second year playing for them, she is sitting concertmaster, which, at a place like Harvard that naturally attracts excellent musicians, is quite a feat for a sophomore.
When I filmed her playing the first movement of Mozart’s Violin Concerto No. 5 in A major, I insisted on two more takes. This was, of course, for professional reasons and not just for the heart-wrenching listening pleasure I got from her tone. Her idols include some of the greatest names of the Western classical string world—David Oistrakh (1908-1974), Isaac Stern (1920-2001), Pinchas Zukerman (1948- )—and their influence is seen in the high standard she sets for herself.
It doesn’t hurt that she practices two hours a day or that she’s been playing since she was three years old, leading her to conclude that “it wasn’t so much... my decision as my parents’ decision.” Her family damn near has the make-up of a small string ensemble—her mother plays the viola, her father played the violin and piano seriously before going into neurology, and her two younger sisters play the cello and violin.
The trick of balance at college is another feat Emma seems to understand well. When asked how she does it, she claims her childhood structure remains as a guideline for ordering her college life. She was taught from a young age that practicing comes before schoolwork because it’s easier to do an essay on autopilot at 3 a.m. than it is to do any productive practicing under the spell of mental exhaustion. But her top priority remains doing what will make her most happy in the long run—which includes an active social life to remain a functional human being and to compensate for the long hours spent alone mastering her craft. Or crafts—because, like her idol, Pinchas Zukerman, Emma plays both the violin and viola.
Sixteen years into her musicianship, she still gets nervous before almost every performance and says, “It’s weird if I don’t get some kind of fast heartbeat.” But she embraces this adrenaline surge and channels it into her performance by coloring outside the lines and trying new things. She shares her bold approach: “If you crash and burn, you crash and burn. There will be another opportunity to perform that piece in your lifetime, I’m sure. I’d rather have an epically bad performance than one that’s really safe and boring.”
Oct. 4 was the HRO’s first performance of the school year as well as her first time leading them as concertmaster. They played Berlioz’s “Symphonie fantastique”; her favorite movement is the fifth and last one translated from French to English as “Dreams of a Witches’ Sabbath.” The personal favorites on her current musical menu include Leoš Janáček's “String Quartet No. 2, ‘Intimate Letters,’” written in 1928, and Arnold Schoenberg’s 1899 string sextet “Verklärte Nacht (Transfigured Night), Op. 4.”
While some of us are patting ourselves on the back for getting out of bed in the morning or, I don’t know, finding matching socks, Emma has a plan moving forward: for graduate school, conservatory is in the cards, and she wants to pursue a career in music because it’s “what I love to do, and I want to be able to love my job.”
So do we, Emma, but we’re too busy loving sleep.

“The only purpose of an overture is to allow latecomers to be seated,” quipped Benjamin Zander, conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, at the beginning of its concert in Sanders Theatre on Oct. 23. The concert was part of the BPO’s “Discovery” series, in which Zander gives a presentation prior to directing each work.
The overture in question was Mozart’s four-and-a-half-minute overture to the opera “Così fan tutte.” The overture was followed by Mozart’s “Sinfonia concertante,” a double concerto featuring Miriam Fried and Kim Kashkashian as violin and viola soloists, respectively. The second half of the concert was Rachmaninoff’s monumental 2nd Symphony, performed uncut. The result was a three-hour-long concert—certainly longer than most, but ultimately satisfying.
In his introduction to the overture to “Così fan tutte,” Zander proudly declared that the audience was about to hear the first performance of the overture “as Mozart truly intended” in 200 years. Zander explained that it seemed intuitive that a musical quote from the opera—appearing once in the “Andante” introduction and returning in the main section, “Presto”—be performed at the same tempo. The result was a structurally cohesive performance: Zander’s interpretation indeed felt natural and highlighted the musical theme that would normally follow in the opera, which brought out the BPO’s virtuosity and lush sound.
Miriam Fried and Kim Kashkashian, both professors at the New England Conservatory, appeared next in Mozart’s “Sinfonia concertante.” Charming as always, Zander introduced Kashkashian as not just “the world’s greatest living violist”—but also “a recent black belt.” True to Zander’s words, Kashkashian shone in the double concerto—her rich tone perfectly complemented, perhaps even engulfed, Fried’s. The “Sinfonia concertante” was filled with polish and character and showed a strong connection between the orchestra and the two soloists.
The core of the concert was Rachmaninoff’s 2nd Symphony. As with the Mozart overture, Zander had some distinctive ideas about the Rachmaninoff. The symphony, around an hour long at full length, is often cut down to as little as 35 minutes, but Zander and the Boston Philharmonic presented the piece in its entirety. However, to ease the blow of an hour of straight music, Zander explained that he would speed up whenever melodies returned. This wasn’t quite convincing—both from a musical and technical perspective—and resulted in some fumbling.
But otherwise, the BPO’s performance of the symphony was utterly beautiful, with a passionate and full sound from the whole orchestra—most notably the string section. The symphony’s lyrical melodies shone, while its violent moments were riotously joyful or furious. And despite taking the fourth movement at what he called a “conservative” tempo, Zander’s energy and intimacy with the orchestra drove it forward without feeling rushed.
By the closing triumphant E-major chords of the symphony, Zander and the BPO had taken the listeners on what Zander described as a journey from the depths of depression to ultimate victory. It was also a day of victory for Zander and the BPO; they had avoided the Rachmaninoff for decades for fear that it would be inaccessible due to its length. Ultimately, the Rachmaninoff—and the Mozart compositions preceding it—made for a very fulfilling concert that justified its length.

From the beginning, race has been central to the sport of 9-man. Imported from Taishan, China, 9-man volleyball came overseas with Chinese immigrants and grew popular in Chinatowns across North America. Due to complications with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, many Chinese men were separated from their families, caught between the home country they left and a new country that was unwilling to fully accept them. “It became this almost all-male society, where men had to…play all these traditionally feminine roles for one another,” Ursula Liang, director of feature documentary “9-Man” said. “9-man was one of those things that helped them bond together and escape the tough lives that they had.”
Race continues to be a point of contention in the 9-man community. Apart from the fact that there are nine men on the court instead of six, 9-man differs from traditional volleyball in three crucial ways: all players must be men, six of the nine players must be “100 percent Chinese,” and all nine players must have some Asian background. There is some unrest in the 9-man community over this rule, but at least for now, it is here to stay. Liang herself is ambivalent on the rule. “I’m not sure it’s my position to feel anything about it…. There are people within the community who feel very strongly one way or the other, and it’s very complicated why they feel one way or the other.”
For Liang, the sport of 9-man has personal significance. She played club volleyball in college at the University of Michigan, but growing up in suburban Newton, Massachusetts, 9-man wasn’t on her radar. It wasn’t until adulthood, playing women’s recreational leagues with other Asian-American women, that she was introduced to 9-man. As a female, Liang was ineligible to play, but her brother did join a team.
“Growing up—my father is Chinese and my mom is German—we had a very limited connection to Chinatown. We would go in for dim sum, and we would do things like that, you know, explore the culture in a very superficial way,” Liang said. “But when my brother joined a 9-man team, he was physically in Chinatown all the time to practice, and he was among Chinese Americans. That kind of experience with the culture was very significant, and it made a very important connection for him.”
It is that underlying spirit of community that is central to the sport of 9-man, and which Liang hopes viewers will pick up in the film. “One of the greatest things for me, when I started to screen the film and get feedback from people, was [when] one of my friends who is Orthodox Jewish watched it and he completely related to the film. And that is something that’s really important to me, that some of the themes in the film are universal,” Liang said. “While on the surface, it’s very specifically a Chinese-American film, hopefully there are other groups that will relate to some of the issues that are brought up in the film, like issues of belonging, or community, or being judged in the realm of sports.”
While the 9-man community is particularly vibrant, sporting communities based around shared factors such as religion and race are not rare. In fact, Liang’s inspiration for the film came in part from “The Fast and the Furious” director Justin Lin’s 2000 documentary “Crossover,” which explores the Japanese-American basketball community.
But for the athletes interviewed in Liang’s documentary, 9-man is what is important. Liang interviewed people ranging from young boys to old men for her film, and all seemed to agree on the importance of the sport. 9-man is something their fathers played and it is something they will pass on to their children: 9-man is special because it is theirs.

I tried to meditate again this morning. I say “try,” because what really happened was that I sat down for a grand total of four minutes and then proceeded to feel like tiny humans were catapulting thoughts upon thoughts upon thoughts across my cranium like in a medieval war. It went something like this:
I wonder if all this talk about the basicness of pumpkin spice lattes has affected drink sales at Starbucks in any way
Itch on my nose
Girl-on-girl microaggression sucks; I probably should never call someone basic ever
The stapler in Lowell’s computer lab has been missing for a while now
Reminder: Christmas
The thoughts flew this way and that way, until finally I had to halt the Battle of Hastings in my brain, leave my room, and move on to something actually productive, like exploring the Lowell tunnels to see which vending machine has the best selection.
Meditation is sexy right now. People who use words like “lifehack” and “crowdsource” in casual conversation definitely know how to talk about the health and productivity benefits of meditation. Even just five minutes a day is better than nothing! You don’t have to be good at it—escape the cycle of self-judgment! Just do it! I want to be like the powerful CEO who wakes up, meditates, goes to the gym, and then accomplishes her remaining four impossible things before breakfast. And that would, like, definitely happen if I really got into the meditation.
And getting work done faster would not be meditation’s sole benefit. The Buddhist principle of nonattachment is legit. I want to walk through the world engaged yet unfazed. I want to care without getting carried away. I want to be able to notice things without judging them, to look at problems as interesting and important to solve but not inherently negative. If I meditated, maybe I would figure out a better way to affix my favorite poster onto my wall instead of getting pissed each day when I arrive home to find it blown to the ground.
Maybe the reason why meditation is so hard to keep up is because the space inside our minds can be scary. I accept overstimulation in my external world all the time. I know it’s not good to constantly be on the lookout for phone notifications and new emails. And I definitely know it isn’t good to text and walk at the same time–I fell up some stairs and ripped my jeans the last time I did that. So, when I shut my eyes to the overstimulation of the external world and find the same old chatter about pumpkin spice lattes going on in my brain, I’m rightfully pissed.
But, I think all of that chatter will get better with practice. I will learn not to judge my thoughts. I’ll notice them and then they’ll prance away just like the stapler thief in Lowell.
So, the problem must be something deeper and more serious.
Sometimes, when I sit by myself and make it for longer than four minutes, I reach a locus of connection—I find a place inside of me that I think might exist in everyone else. I find the junction at which I’m attached to every other person on earth. I’m not like, Enlightened or anything, but I just feel very human and very much the same as every other human.
But with this whole meditation business, there’s always the lurking chance that I’ll find another place—the part within me that feels different; idiosyncratic. The part that reminds me how alone I am. Louis C.K. brilliantly pinpointed this feeling on Conan last year when he explained why people text and drive. Louis says people text to escape a lurking feeling of sadness and loneliness—when the feeling creeps up, they squash it by reaching out for some sort of connection, even if that connection is superficial and fleeting. And then he said the most validating thing: “Sadness is poetic; you’re lucky to live sad moments.” Louis is right—only if we open ourselves up to those sad, lonely feelings when they come can we truly start to feel the beauty of our lives.
Sometimes, I don’t want to look into my mind because I’m afraid of what I might find there. But there’s a beautiful aesthetic to life, and this aesthetic exists in my internal world as well as my external one. If I don’t shut my eyes and look inside of my mind, I’m missing out on a pretty gorgeous place. So I think I can spare more than four minutes a day to spend some time there.

The national beverage industry is at it again. They’re trashing the Massachusetts Bottle Bill with $8 million worth of ads about what Question 2, the Bottle Bill update, would do for recycling and the environment. A recent Boston Globe article said the ads contained “false” and “inaccurate statistics”—or what some of our friends call “malarkey.”
So what’s the real story?
If you’re as old as we are, you’ll remember that just over three decades ago, Massachusetts voters decided to reduce litter and increasing recycling by approving the original Bottle Bill. Almost overnight, we started returning beer and soda bottles and cans for recycling—and litterbugs found a new incentive to stop trashing our environment. It was a big win for our environment, and it worked.
Back then, though, beer and soda were about the only drinks that came in single-serve containers. The Bottle Bill covered all of these bottles and cans, and we recycled the vast majority of them. Today, when you walk into a CVS or Cumberland Farms, what do you see? Bottled water, sports drinks, and other non-deposit beverages—which barely existed 30 years ago—have taken over the store shelves. Only about a quarter of those bottles get recycled.
That’s a billion bottles of Poland Spring, Gatorade, and other beverages that each year are ending up in landfills—or by the curb outside your house, in the park where the neighborhood kids play, or on the forest trail where you go for a hike on the weekend. And in recent years, as the number of containers has increased, the recycling rate has fallen.
After seeing or hearing those industry ads a few dozen times, you might think curbside recycling is the answer and that somehow updating the Bottle Bill is competing with that agenda. That is, in a word, absurd. The Bottle Bill and curbside work together. Think about it: If you have curbside, it’s an easy way to recycle. If you don’t have curbside or need a little more incentive to recycle, you can bring back your bottles and get your deposits. Even if you were a lazy litterbug (unlikely, given that you’ve read this far), someone else might well pick up your discarded bottle to get your deposit back.
In fact, since we passed the Bottle Bill, curbside recycling has grown in our state: Though curbside was once only available in a handful of cities, 47 percent of all Massachusetts cities and towns now provide curbside programs. And here’s an inconvenient truth the ads entirely omit: Curbside recycling has grown in part because unreturned bottle deposits have gone to fund recycling programs.
The simple truth is that if we update the Bottle Bill to include sports drinks, bottled water and other non-deposit beverages, we’ll keep about 72 million pounds per year of trash out of our environment, divert massive amounts of petroleum, the main ingredient in those plastic bottles, from being tossed, and build on a familiar system that Massachusetts residents have known and used for more than 30 years.
By the way, another simple truth the ad people hope we ignore? We get our bottle deposits back. That’s why it’s called a “deposit.”
The Bottle Bill is the best recycling program we’ve ever had, and updating it will keep even more bottle and can trash out of our lives. So the next time you hear one of those ads, take a deep breath and remind yourself what the Bottle Bill has really meant for your community, your parks and playgrounds, and your favorite beaches and forests.
Then resolve to vote “Yes” on 2. Let’s not fall for the beverage industry’s malarkey. Let’s update the Bottle Bill so it works even better to clean up our streets and parks, improve recycling and keep Massachusetts beautiful.

When former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino passed away last Thursday, Boston lost its longest-serving chief executive, Harvard lost a partner, and the community lost a symbol of Boston’s cohesiveness, toughness, and spirit of renewal. With his uniqu  style of personal politics and his emphasis on Boston’s neighborhoods, Menino was not only “the mayors’ mayor,” as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg called him, but was also a constant presence in every part of the city and in the lives of its residents. These qualities, combined with his commitment to banish the racial polarization that still haunted the city he inherited in 1993, will ensure that history will remember him as one of urban America’s great public servants.
Anecdotes illustrating Mayor Menino’s commitment to the city he led for an unprecedented two decades are numerous. The Boston Herald highlighted Menino’s grit in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, when the mayor checked himself out of the hospital despite a broken leg, and attended the next day’ s memorial service “in obvious pain” in order to deliver his tribute to the victims and to the city.
The Boston Globe focused on the sense of justice that defined Menino’s successes in urban renewal. Mayor Menino was always a staunch opponent of discrimination. He consistently led development of low-income, black and Latino sections of the city, and was an early supporter of LGBTQ rights.
Most fundamentally, Mayor Menino was a creature of Boston’s distinctive neighborhoods. His reputation as the “urban mechanic,” most at home with street-level issues, may have had certain negative connotations of small-mindedness or lack of vision. But to any Bostonian who lived during his mayoralty, Menino embodied what a politician should be. That more than half of Boston’s residents recalled meeting him is a testament to the Mayor’s commitment to all his constituents.
The mayor’s commitment to neighborhoods was also the basis of Harvard’s relationship with the mayor. This relationship was not always warm; Menino was rightfully indignant when he learned, in 1998, that Harvard had anonymously been buying up land in Allston. But he and former University President Lawrence H. Summers renewed the partnership between town and University; he and President Drew G. Faust then maintained and expanded that partnership through the difficult days of the recession. Harvard’s ongoing development of community programs in Allston, its strong presence in the Longwood Medical Area, and its creation of fellowship programs between the Law School, the Business School, and Boston’s government are a testament to the strength of the relationship that grew under Menino’s guidance. Both city and university are better for his leadership.
Perhaps a classic machine politician, Menino may have exhibited some of the flaws that go along with that model. As the Globe noted, “he favored certain developers,” took a personal interest in almost every construction project, and often banished enemies “to the political wilderness.”  But none of these criticisms overshadow Menino’s overwhelmingly positive legacy.
Neither the greatest of public speakers nor the most sweeping of ideologues, Mayor Menino rather displayed an incredible human touch. The enormous care with which he carried out his work on behalf of the people of Boston allowed him to oversee one of America’s great urban renewals. He will rightfully remain a beloved figure in the city, at Harvard, and beyond, and will be sorely missed.

The University Benefits Committee—a group of faculty and staff experts on employee benefits, of which we are members—is responsible for advising the provost on matters related to Harvard’s health benefits.
Each year we explore possible benefit changes based on fiscal guidance and input from our benefit consultants.  In general we explore ways to best address the challenges related to health care that all employers are facing.  Importantly, while we take past health care spending trends into account, our decisions largely reflect future spending projections.
Over the years we have made many changes designed to moderate spending trends. For example, last year we rebid our insurer contract, substantially reducing fees paid to insurance carriers. This year, after much discussion, we recommended a number of benefit changes. We wanted to take the opportunity to communicate with the community about the process and some of the thinking behind our recommendations.
Over the course of the year, the UBC examined a range of options for how we might best design a plan to address projected future growth in health benefits costs. We looked at how different scenarios would impact faculty and staff and how they compared to those at our peer institutions. In the process we did extensive analyses, with the help of an outside consultant, of our own data as well as information from our peers.  At the conclusion of our work, we made recommendations to the provost, which he accepted.
As we did our work we were guided by a series of principles: ensuring that we are spending our health care dollars effectively; sharing risk across the community; protecting faculty and staff with high health care costs; providing incentives for employees and beneficiaries to make efficient health care choices and supporting community members at the lower end of the pay scale. We have sought to ensure that the plans would uphold these principles.
There are multiple changes in the benefits that, though reducing premium growth, will lead to an increase in costs born by many employees who use health care. There is now a deductible (the amount that must be paid for health care services before the health plan begins to pay) that applies to services such as hospital admissions and co-insurance (the share of the cost of health care services after the deductible) for most services outside preventative care, emergency care, and routine care provided in a doctor’s office.
We introduced a new low premium, high deductible plan that includes a university contribution to a health savings account and offers significant financial benefits to employees who use less health care. Finally, we increased the generosity of the dental benefit package to protect employees and dependents with significant dental bills.
We recognize that with these changes, employees will often pay more for care at the point of service. In part that is intended because patient cost sharing is proven to reduce overall spending.
Yet we were very concerned about the burden on low-income employees and therefore recommended an expanded reimbursement program that will provide them with additional protections from high out-of-pocket costs.
Moreover, because we know that our community values having a wide choice of physicians and hospitals, we opted not to offer a “narrow” network plan, a plan that typically costs less and is now offered by multiple employers throughout the country but limit choice of provider.
These changes keep our health benefits in line with peer institutions. Specifically, Harvard employees on average will still pay less for their medical care than similarly situated employees at other comparable employers. Comparisons with our university peers confirm that Harvard’s plans remain competitive. To place this in context with non-university employers, total costs on average for Harvard employees earning less than $70,000 per year are approximately a third less than those for people covered by the state’s Group Insurance Commission health plans.
Finally, Harvard’s plans are progressive, with several features designed to help those who take home less pay. All employees will benefit from a reduction in premiums, and the progressive premium subsidy program—through which Harvard pays a greater percentage of total premiums for those on lower incomes—is maintained.
The new reimbursement program will also reduce costs for those earning up to $95,000 per year. And for those making less than $70,000 global out-of-pocket maximums will effectively drop from $1,500 to $900 for an individual.
There has been much discussion of the rise in health care costs across the country in recent years. Our work and recommendations are about the future, and we have taken that charge seriously. Yes, we anticipate that health care costs will continue to rise for Harvard—but these changes ultimately are designed to slow the rate that those costs will grow in coming years, ensuring fewer resources are diverted away from Harvard’s research and teaching mission, and offering a benefit that offers value to members of our community.
We believe these are reasonable changes designed to help the University confront the financial challenges we face. The plans are competitive, progressive and maintain a commitment to prevention and choice in providers.

“Me-ni-no Park!”
Every morning, just as we turn left out of our driveway, my two-year-old cries out, points right towards the Charlestown Navy Yard, and beckons “that way.” There’s no place she loves more.
And what a place it is. Beautiful new slides. Vibrant colors. Picturesque views of the Harbor. But it’s no ordinary park.
Shortly after his own stay in Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, Mayor Thomas M. Menino toured its new site in early 2013. Noticing a nearby plot of land, he saw not what was, but what could be. What should be. For a man who decried vision, he had the best one imaginable: a city where everyone is welcome.
Mayor Thomas M. Menino Park is Boston’s first universally accessible playground. A place where children of all abilities play together, the sign reads. My Riley and Jack ride the carousel and swing side-by-side with their peers in wheelchairs. It’s so natural. And yet so important. Cities need to work for all their people. This park does. It is a place of renewal, resilience, inclusion, and utter joy. It is quintessentially Menino.
He was obsessed with making Boston a better place. We don’t live in an equal world or an equal Boston. But he worked daily to correct for the inequities and injustices that marred the city’s past.
The lasting image I have of him is at the head of a long table, looking out onto Faneuil Hall and the Freedom Trail below. Most see him out in the neighborhoods, which mostly was where he was. He told you to get out of here. Stop spouting all your nonsense and literally get out of the building and into the community. That’s where the city is.
But I see him at the table and hear him delivering one key message loud and clear. Government is about helping people. I heard him say it almost every day.
I don’t blame you for dismissing it as a slogan. Politics these days too often feels like empty words and even emptier agendas. Campaigning in poetry and governing in no’s.
But he meant it with every fiber of his being. That’s why he was there. The office wasn’t a stepping stone to some higher summit. For him, being mayor was the top of the mountain. And he pulled others who had a tougher climb up with him.
Boy did he do a lot of heavy lifting. He was a gladiator. He worked his face off. We were no match for Tom Menino.
He showed up everywhere. And he kept showing up year after year. It wasn’t an election year drop-in. It was an I’m-going-to-be-here-for-you-every-damn-day-and-I’m-going-to-keep-coming-back. Just ask around. That 2009 stat that 57 percent of residents personally met the Mayor is undeniably powerful. But I wish they’d counted how many met him more than once. I’d bet almost as many.
He lived his life in service to others. Two of the best years of mine were spent in service to him.
You wouldn’t characterize him as emotive or over the top but he overflowed with love for the city. He restored my faith in government, and in faith. He showed that a good Catholic was one that stood up—to the Church, to Chick-Fil-A, to the NRA. He’s surely up there opening the gates a little wider.
He knew where he came from. He lived in the same neighborhood, in the same modest house, for decades. He knew who he was. He was a proud Italian who made me proud to be one.
On this Tuesday, of all days, think of Mayor Menino. (Mostly be grateful he’s not running against you.) He loved Election Day and the civic pride shared by citizens all over the city, the Commonwealth, the country—especially the newly naturalized ones.
But don’t think of him wistfully. Like a great man who once was. He’s not gone. Not today.
Of all the stirring stories from the last week, the one that moved me most was this: He voted. Amidst everything he faced in his final days, he cast his ballot. Absentee but fully present. He never forgot the difference that one person could make and the responsibility one had to make it.
So honor him today and vote.
And then come out to Menino Park. Truly, everyone is welcome.

In a recent Harvard School of Public Health poll, 52 percent of respondents said they were concerned there would be an Ebola outbreak in the United States in the next year, though some faculty members at the School of Public Health and the Medical School have been quick to point out that an outbreak is unlikely.
The proportion of respondents concerned about an upcoming outbreak increased 13 percentage points, up from 39 percent in August. However, Michael J. VanRooyen, a professor at HSPH and HMS, said that despite the public’s increasing concern, Ebola is not a large threat to U.S. residents.
“I don’t think an [Ebola] epidemic is likely at all,” he said.
Professor and former dean of HSPH Barry R. Bloom agreed, noting that the disease could be contained after entering the U.S. “The probability that [someone infected would come into the U.S.] is a possibility, but it is unlikely that, if you track down their contacts, it would spread,” he said.
The poll also suggested that many Americans are misinformed about how Ebola can be transmitted.
Ninety-five percent of respondents said they believe that a person is likely to get Ebola from contact with bodily fluids of a symptomatic person, while 88 percent indicated that they believe that a person is likely to get Ebola by touching surfaces that have been in contact with infectious bodily fluids. While these are in fact methods of transmission, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 85 percent of respondents also said they believe that a person is likely to get Ebola if they are coughed or sneezed on by a symptomatic person. The World Health Organization has said this is not a likely method of transmission, if it happens at all.
“If this is the perception of the public, there is still a lot of education that has to be done by credible sources,” VanRooyen said. “It’s good that people don’t ignore it or think that it’s not a serious threat—I think it’s a potential threat—we just need a good understanding as to the real risk [of Ebola transmission].”
Bloom and VanRooyen both agreed that, although Ebola is a deadly disease, medical treatment is sufficient in the U.S. to treat those with Ebola as long as hospitals are prepared to deal with the disease. Participants in the poll seemed to broadly share Bloom and VanRooyen’s confidence, with eighty percent of respondents saying that they believe someone in their community would survive Ebola with medical care.
According to Gillian K. SteelFisher, deputy director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, the poll will provide information to policy leaders and media, facilitating the development of public policy to combat the disease.
“We [conduct polls] not to be sensationalist,” she said. “[Our goal] is to actually try to provide a lens into a complex and frightening issue for people.”
The poll surveyed a total of 1,004 people from Oct. 8-12, interviewed via telephone, and marked the second in a series by HSPH, with the first poll conducted in August. SteelFisher said that she plans to continue with additional polls in order to gauge public perception of the disease.

Through studying a 45,000-year-old specimen, evolutionary geneticists have determined that the ancestors of modern humans and present-day people of Eurasian descent have similar levels of Neanderthal DNA.
The findings, which come from genome sequencing performed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and which were published on Oct. 22 in the journal “Nature,” may shed new light on the human mutation rate over time.
The 45,000-year-old modern human femur that prompted these results was found in 2008 by artist and amateur paleontologist Nikolai Peristov in a West Siberian river bank.
“Peristov was travelling in the region, collecting mammoth ivory for his carvings,” Janet Kelso, a professor specializing in evolutionary genetics at the Max Planck Institute, said in an email. “He recognized that the bone might be important and brought it to scientists in Omsk for further work.”
When the scientists applied initial radiocarbon dating techniques to the sample, they were surprised by the results.
“This [sample] is almost older than the early modern humans [previously found in] Africa and the Middle East,” said Qiaomei Fu, a research fellow studying genetics at Harvard Medical School who worked on the specimen. In fact, scientists at the Planck Institute performed the radiocarbon test twice to verify the sample’s age, Kelso said.
When both tests confirmed that the sample was from Siberia and dated to 45,000 years ago, the scientists also concluded that early modern human migrations into Eurasia were not solely via the route that had been suggested by previous models. Since this genetic makeup also indicated that the specimen’s ancestors interbred with Neanderthals close to the time of the major expansion of modern humans out of Africa and the Middle East, the original settling patterns may have to be reassessed, Kelso said.
“There might be more than one possibility for the humans’ movement,” Fu said.
During the DNA testing process, the scientists said that they continued to make unexpected discoveries.
“Ancient DNA analysis, which once was a dream, has now become a possibility,” said Priya Moorjani, a postdoctoral student in biology at Columbia University who worked on the techniques for the specimen’s DNA analysis while obtaining her Ph.D. from Harvard. “That really gives you an opportunity to study the past in a way that was not possible before.”
While scientists found that the specimen’s genome was broadly similar to that of present-day humans, they noted that it contained longer segments of Neanderthal DNA, suggesting that the ancestors of the specimen mixed with Neanderthals approximately 7,000-13,000 years before the man lived.
“[The sample] is really close to present-day humans but is much, much more close to the Neanderthal,” Fu said.
Analyzing the specimen’s genome also allowed the Planck team to gain new insight into human evolution. “Ancient DNA has been able to provide an independent estimate of the human mutation rate…and suggests that between one and two mutations per year have accumulated in the genomes of populations in Europe and Asia since [the specimen] lived,” Kelso said.
The scientists said that they are excited to see what these results will mean for the field in the coming years.
“[These specimens] help us tease apart where humans come from and how long they have inhabited different parts of the world,” Moorjani said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Author Darryl Pinckney and Kennedy School of Government professor Alex Keyssar pointed out that voter suppression still takes place in contemporary politics during a discussion at the Kennedy School’s Ash Center Monday. In the forum, Keyssar and Pinckney focused on Pinckney’s recent book, “Blackballed: The Black Vote and US Democracy.”
In “Blackballed,” Pinckney explores the disenfranchisement and political exclusion of African Americans throughout American history and obstacles that groups may face in pursuit of the right to vote. Keyssar, who teaches history at the Kennedy School, gave the examples of new voter ID laws, the shortening of early voting periods on weekends, and the disallowance of third-party voter registration as ways in which voters are suppressed in modern-day United States.
“This wave of voter suppression is a reaction to events that have taken place over the previous half-century: the acquisition of political power by African Americans in the South and the very large waves of immigration in the last 30 years,” Keyssar said.
Keyssar also expressed praise for Pinckney’s book, calling it a “meditative essay on the meaning of the black vote, disenfranchisement, and about what that says about American democracy.”
Pinckney, who has written several other books commemorating black history, such as “High Cotton” and “Out There: Mavericks of Black Literature,” also shared some of the reasons that he wrote his newest book.
“I wrote this book as an apology to my parents for my arrogance,” Pinckney said. “I found conversations [about black history] to be tiring and always about discrimination, but I see now that it was about the need for justice.”
Pinckney said that his book was written not only to document the history of discrimination against black voters in the South before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, but also to attempt to navigate the state of voting rights today.
Amid some restrictive voting rights regulations on the books today, Pinckney said, blacks have continued to fight for political sway.
“One of the things that makes the black vote so important is that it is huge, overwhelming, passionate, and tends to be democratic,” Pinckney said.
Keyssar and Pinckney concluded their discussion by sharing their thoughts on the current state of affairs in the nation’s capital and what the future holds for America after the Barack Obama administration.

Cantabrigians entering voting booths around Harvard today can expect to cast ballots that will determine a contentious gubernatorial race and some ballot measures. The other races on the ballot are less contested with many incumbents widely expected to cruise to victory.
As voters check off names down the ballot, they will find most local races either uncontested or, in the case of statewide positions, clearly in Democratic hands, but analysts expect that each vote will matter in the Massachusetts gubernatorial election and Question 1 of the ballot initiatives.
The ballot begins with the choice for the United States Senate. After winning a special election last year to fill current Secretary of State John Kerry’s vacant seat, Democratic incumbent Edward J. Markey now holds a comfortable lead over his Republican challenger Brian Herr and will likely kick off his first full term.
Next on the ballot is the highly anticipated Massachusetts gubernatorial race. Both Republican Charles D. Baker ’79, a former health insurance executive and government official, and Democrat Martha M. Coakley, the state attorney general finishing her second term, are looking for political redemption after losing close elections in 2010. Baker lost his gubernatorial bid to Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Coakley her Senate bid to Scott Brown.
Baker’s campaign has emphasized his professed management expertise, while Coakley has run on her commitment to liberal values. Polls in recent weeks have given Baker a lead over Coakley—a startling turnaround since last spring, when Coakley held substantial leads over potential competitors.
A Baker victory would not be novel in Massachusetts. Even though it is one of the most reliably Democratic states in presidential and congressional elections, Republicans won four consecutive gubernatorial races in the Bay State from 1990 to 2002.
If successful, Coakley would be the first elected female governor in Massachusetts history.
For the statewide offices that follow the governorship on the ballot, Democratic candidates are expected to sweep the board. Democrat Maura T. Healey ’92 is noted for her efforts on civil rights litigation and will likely become the first openly gay attorney general in the United States.
Voters will next encounter Cambridge-specific positions on their ballot, where most incumbents are running unopposed. Non-races include the contests for U.S. Representative for the Massachusetts 5th District, State Senator, State Representative, and District Attorney. The remaining two local positions—Councilor and Register of the Probate—have incumbents likely to coast to victory.
The four questions at the bottom of the ballot have sparked controversy this election cycle, even finding their way often into gubernatorial debates.
The first question involves repealing a 2013 law that tied the state gas tax to inflation rates, thereby making the state tax that funds road and bridge reparations automatically increase every year. Baker took a firm stance against the law as taxation without representation, although proponents of the law see it as an assurance that state infrastructure can be maintained. Voting yes would stop the indexing of the gas tax. It is the only ballot question where polls remain inconclusive as to the result.
The next two initiatives have faced concentrated opposition campaigns financed by business interests. Question 2 would expand the state’s bottle deposit law, which advocates argue has succeeded in reducing litter, to cover all non-alcoholic and non-carbonated drinks. It would add a nickel to the price of many more bottles that could be redeemed if the bottles are brought to a recycling facility. Question 3 would repeal a 2011 law permitting casinos within Massachusetts.
The opposition campaigns seem to have succeeded: recent polling suggests a majority of Bay Staters will vote no to both, thereby preventing the expansion of the bottle bill and permitting gambling facilities to operate. A “yes” majority on Question 3 would allow plans for a large casino near Springfield to continue.
Question 4 is the last item on Cantabrigians’ ballots. It would guarantee Massachusetts workers the right to earn and use sick time and is very popular among likely voters. Baker opposes the measure, while Coakley’s campaign has emphasized her support of the initiative.
Polls around Massachusetts will be open Tuesday from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.

A new study by Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute researchers found that, although cancer patients are enrolling in hospice programs at higher rates, their consumption of intensive and expensive hospital services near the end of life has paradoxically increased as well.
The study, published in the October issue of the Journal of Oncology, examined the Medicare records of nearly 7,000 ovarian cancer patients between 1997 and 2007 and found that hospice care, traditionally thought of as a substitute for hospitalization, has in reality become more of an “add-on” to end-of-life intensive care.
“What it looks like from our study is that patients are getting intensive care up until the very end of their lives and then being referred [from the hospital] to hospice very close to death,” said Alexi A. Wright, lead author of the study and an assistant professor at HMS.
The study paints a chaotic picture of the final months and days of these cancer patients, according to Wright, and highlights the need for making substantive, well-informed end-of-life care plans while in good health.
“If we were able to figure out what patients’ preferences are earlier by having real conversations about what matters to people, there’s pretty good data to suggest that people would choose less intensive care and would have a lot more peaceful end-of-life experience[s],” Wright said. Patients, she added, would be able to spend more time with their families and plan for the future, including their families’ lives without them.
These early conversations, according to study co-author and HMS assistant professor Laura A. Hatfield, need to focus on understanding a patient’s prognosis.
“To know that this is a terminal illness in the first place is step one,” she said. “And that is not happening in many cases. Doctors seem reluctant to discuss prognosis—especially of a terminal illness—with their patient.”
Wright agreed, adding that patients might also consider enrolling in hospice early to maximize their quality of life and physical comfort, as well as that of their caregivers.
“When you use hospice as an add-on service it doesn’t really do what it’s designed to do, which is to be there and deliver care in a patient-centered way, in the patient’s home,” Wright said. In a previous study, Wright and a research team found that people who enrolled in hospice for less than a week did not experience any improvements in their quality of life near death.
Study co-author Craig Earle also noted that early enrollment in hospice would mean patients could benefit more from features like “symptom control,” which allows care providers to focus on minimizing symptoms, rather than attempting to cure terminal illnesses.
The big takeaway, according to Wright, is that, “the earlier people can make plans with their families and their physicians, the more likely it is that they can control the kind of care that they receive at the end of life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 4, 2014, at 5:00 p.m.
Fashion mogul Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Hilfiger Executive Chairman Fred Gehring spoke to an audience of about 100 about the history of their company and the lessons they had learned during their long careers in business, among other topics, at Harvard Business School Monday afternoon.
The event was hosted by the HBS Retail and Luxury Goods Club and consisted of an hour-long discussion directed by questions submitted by HBS students prior to the event, according to moderator Raffaella Sadun.
One of the main topics of the evening was the turbulent history of Hilfiger's first venture People's Place. In the small town of Elmira in upstate New York, Hilfiger began designing clothes that he thought were “cool,” “vibrant,” “aspirational,” and “all-American,” he said. His company expanded rapidly, but his inexperience led the company to bankruptcy in teh mid-1970s.
“That was my MBA,” Hilfiger quipped.
Hilfiger picked himself back up by attempting to find new investors and launching a new company, Tommy Hilfiger. Within a few years, the company became publicly traded and enjoyed widespread “hype,” Gehring said. But the company’s troubles were far from over.
“Board members were all independents, so there were people from the banking industry and the insurance industry…. These people really didn’t understand the fashion and apparel business,” Hilfiger said. “As a public company, you have this desire to please the shareholders on a regular basis. And you have to push and push and push to get the sales high, and the profits high…. That was very unhealthy.”
As a result of brand oversaturation, an emphasis on cutting costs, and a decline in quality, the company’s North American branch entered a downward spiral, according to Gehring.
Reconnecting with the company’s roots was central to the firm’s rehabilitation, Gehring said.
“Fred spent to re-engage in the creative–runway shows, the advertising, the whole vibe of the brand became alive again. It was a turning point,” Hilfiger said.
Students in attendance at the event said they found the company’s story motivational.
“These guys are the original entrepreneurs. They went through the transformation…. They had a tough time in the U.S. and they turned it around, which is something that doesn’t usually happen,” said Leontios Toumpouris, a student at the Business School.
Others said that they learned practical lessons for their future business endeavors.
“Hearing how [Hilfiger] grew the brand and how he changed his strategy when he needed to was really great, something that I can apply to my career in the future,” said Kaye Kirschner.
When asked what advice he would give to students in attendance, Gehring said, “Looking back over all of it…I couldn’t have planned it. This whole desire for everybody to have a really mapped-out career lined up is overrated.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Novemeber 4, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated which of Tommy Hilfiger's companies went bankrupt in the 1970s. In fact, it was Hilfiger's first company, People's Place, that went bankrupt in the mid-1970s.

Posing for a portrait, Moiya A. S. McTier ’16 stands before a pale blue wall holding a blackboard with the handwritten phrase, “I shouldn’t have to prove my bisexuality.” The image is just one of 45 photos of Harvard students and alumni that make up the new “In the Making” photo campaign, which aims to increase awareness about issues that persist in the queer community despite recent progress towards marriage equality.
Campaign creators Curtis L. Lahaie ’15 and Kyle J. McFadden ’18 launched the online photo gallery Monday, along with a social media campaign and a 60-day fundraiser to raise $10,000 for three nonprofit organizations working on LGBTQ-related concerns.
While marriage equality does matter, Lahaie and McFadden said, the prominence of the issue tends to overshadow other problems still affecting queer individuals. They said that they hoped to shed light on some of these problems by telling individual stories with portraits and personalized signs held by participants.
“They aren’t just a bunch of lines that we came up with and assigned to various people,” McFadden added. “They are personal displays of struggles [participants] had gone through.”
Some of the lines included “Bi, not ‘confused’,” “Can’t pray away my gay,” “Queer justice is racial justice,” and “I can be fired for my ‘lifestyle choice.’”
“Statistics can provide useful information,” Lahaie said. “But when you put faces to these statistics, it makes it so much more powerful.”
McTier, for example, said that her line directly addressed the doubts others have expressed about her sexuality.
The campaign bears similarities to the “I, Too, Am Harvard” and “EmBODYIndia” campaigns, which featured students holding signs with statements to raise awareness about racial diversity at Harvard and sexual assault in India, respectively.
Although “In the Making” was originally conceptualized for one of Lahaie’s classes, Lahaie said it quickly took on greater meaning. The campaign has received funding from the Open Gate Foundation, a charitable foundation established by queer alumni to fund LGBTQ-related activities and events at Harvard. Lahaie and McFadden are also partnering with Queer Students and Allies to carry out the campaign’s fundraiser through the online crowd-funding platform Indiegogo.
The project’s gallery currently consists of 45 individual portraits and accompanying lines shot by McFadden. While Lahaie and McFadden have discussed the possibility of holding a second photoshoot and expanding the number of official images, they said “In the Making” also challenges viewers to create and share their own photos on social media, and that they hope the campaign will spread beyond Harvard to other universities.
Tey Meadow, the assistant professor of Sociology whose course prompted the campaign, said she thinks that the project has garnered so many participants because it allows them to show aspects of themselves not reflected in mainstream media.
“[It] leads me to believe that [Lahaie] has tapped into some need in the community to be represented,” she said.

The Cambridge City Council reviewed new appointees to fill several recently vacated positions on the Cambridge Planning Board—an organization that meets twice a month to review zoning proposals and amendments—at its weekly meeting Monday.
City Manager Richard C. Rossi on Monday appointed three newcomers to the Board: Mary T. Flynn, a manager of facilities management at Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, Louis J. Bacci Jr., a union representative of Laborers Local 151, and Thacher Tiffany, an urban planner and director of acquisitions for the Beacon Communities. Their tenures are set to begin on Dec. 1.
Rossi also re-appointed H. Theodore Cohen and Catherine Preston Connolly, who are already serving on the Board.
Together, the five appointees will serve alongside continuing members Steven Cohen, Tom Sieniewicz, Hugh Russell, and Ahmed Nur.
Rossi said that the new appointees would bring significant experience and diversity to the Planning Board.
“The composition of the new board provides greater balance and representation in terms of neighborhood distribution, diversity of opinion, community perspective, and professional background,” Rossi said in his letter.
Nevertheless, some criticized the Planning Board for not being sufficiently representative of the greater Cambridge community. Heather Hoffman, a Cambridge resident who spoke during public comment, noted that all the appointees and a majority of current Board members hold careers related to urban development. Hoffman argued that it would be beneficial for more of the Board members, who serve five-year terms, to have a broader array of professional experience.
“It would be a huge step in the right direction to have someone on the planning board whose paycheck does not come from the development business,” Hoffman said.
Councilor Nadeem A. Mazen echoed Hoffman’s concerns, citing a need for the increased presence of non-specialist community leaders on the Planning Board to moderate the opinions of architects, builders, and union leaders.
“Take people who are knowledgeable, but share a minority opinion,” Mazen suggested to Rossi.
In response, Councilor Marc McGovern said that a diversity of opinions could still exist, even with a relatively homogenous board.
“You can get two people in the same room from the same profession, and they could have two different views about how to proceed,” McGovern said.
Rossi said that he did not segregate individuals as members or nonmembers of a larger “development community.” Instead, he said he evaluated each member based upon his or her specific dedication and knowledge about planning.
“These are people who really care about Cambridge and they have a deep interest in making the process better,” Rossi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a cold fall afternoon, Gary was panhandling outside of Leavitt & Peirce with a sign, asking passers-by for a “winter hat” for “The Homeless Guy.” He was homeless as of 14 months ago, when he was released from jail.
“I got out last April, and they gave me $100 on a Friday afternoon and that was it,” Gary said. “What are you going to do with $100 on a Friday afternoon at 3 o’ clock?”
Gary, who declined to give his last name, is one of many homeless people in Massachusetts who is struggling to find housing in a market that has rebounded since the recent recession.
Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released a report declaring that, although the homeless population nationally has declined since 2007, the homeless population in Massachusetts has grown and, moreover, experienced the third highest increase of the 50 states in the past year.
Trends in homelessness in Cambridge have also failed to keep up with national trends. For the past several years, even as the economy has recovered, the number of homeless people in Cambridge has remained constant.
Liz Mengers of the Cambridge Human Services Department said that the persistent rate of homelessness in Cambridge might be due to Cambridge’s relatively robust welfare services and its need for more federal funding for permanent housing projects.
“We’re resource-rich and draw in people in crisis,” Mengers said, noting that people facing hard times in surrounding cities might come to the Boston area for homelessness services.
Laurie Gold, who specializes in strategic planning for community development organizations with Viva Consulting, noted that the lack of adequate housing funding is a problem faced all across the state. According to Gold, Massachusetts has suffered as housing prices rose post-recession and as sequestration spelled cuts for the HUD budget in recent years.
“The state really does its best,” Gold said. “But the big bucks we rely on to solve the problem are federal resources.”
Meanwhile, Gold said, the homeless are priced out of a place to live. She said the housing prices have “accelerated like crazy” in the Boston area and in other major cities, such as New York.
Lt. Michael Harper of the Salvation Army said that he had seen several homeless individuals who were holding down jobs nonetheless struggle to find a home.
“We have people who stay in our shelter who have jobs,” Harper said. “They just can’t afford to have an apartment.”
Gary said that he is beginning seasonal work selling Christmas trees. After saving some of his earnings and collecting insurance for a physical disability, he said he plans to find housing outside of Massachusetts.
“I’ll get something—it’s not going to be nothing great,” Gary said. “I won’t live in Cambridge obviously...but you could go to other cities.”

On Thursday afternoon, Yale faculty will vote on a proposal to adopt a version of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” for the fall of 2015, potentially bringing to New Haven the intellectual content of Harvard’s most popular undergraduate course.
But the arrangement, if approved, could also lay the foundation for a new model of inter-university curricular partnerships in an era of institutional experimentation with online education, faculty and experts in the field say.
Though the exact format and terms of the exchange have yet to be ironed out, Yale Computer Science Department chair Joan Feigenbaum ’81 said informal proposals have called for the live streaming of CS50 lectures delivered by David J. Malan ’99 in Cambridge to students in New Haven. The course, already approved on Oct. 16 by Yale’s Course of Study Committee for a three-year trial period, would be led by an on-the-ground instructor and Yale support staff, who would hold office hours and sections in a sort of “joint Harvard-Yale CS50,” according to Feigenbaum.
Academic collaboration between campuses, of course, is far from unprecedented, but the proposed course sharing may represent a modernization of older resource-sharing models such as textbooks or guest lecturers, faculty members and experts say.
Justin Reich, a HarvardX research fellow, said that there are two ways to think about how a university might use a MOOC: as a full, adapted course, or as learning material intended to supplement an educational experience.
Faculty Director of HarvardX Robert A. Lue agreed, saying that the course could be, in some ways, the equivalent of Yale using a textbook written by a Harvard faculty member.
“The degree to which this is not a more technological, perhaps interactive version of that idea remains to be seen,” Lue said, adding that HarvardX was not involved in discussions to bring CS50 to Yale. “It’s a sharing of a pedagogical framework.”
The analogy, though, has its limits. Where textbooks can supplement existing courses, the proposed arrangement suggests the importation of a series of lectures closer to a course itself.
Malan wrote in an emailed statement this week that he expects to present a clear plan for a potential project in December. A joint venture would likely need the approval of Harvard’s faculty.
Regardless of the collaboration’s finer details, faculty members and experts agree that the exploratory nature of the proposed project itself could catalyze other partnerships and experiments across higher education.
“Nobody really has any idea where all this is going, but it appears to be creating a lot of potential and interesting new directions that haven't been possible before,” said Gary King, a University professor who was integral in the founding of edX.
Ray Schroeder, the associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois at Springfield and an expert in online education, said the development may lead to emulation by other universities.
“I expect that we are going see quite a bit more of this at all levels of education,” Schroeder said. “Now, one would hope that there would be reciprocity and that there would be a Yale course or two that would have interest at Harvard, and it would be great to see several courses going in each direction in this kind of agreement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Novemeber 4, 2014, at 1:30 p.m.
The Business School’s HBX digital learning initiative is expanding to both international and corporate clients, following the success of its inaugural online business-oriented courses that saw an 85 percent completion rate, school leaders said.
HBX, which was formally announced in March, is a virtual education platform derivative of the case-study teaching method used in classrooms at the Business School. Among other features, the platform emphasizes peer collaboration and social interactivity alongside videos and other learning materials to adapt the discussion-oriented pedagogy employed in the school's physical classrooms to an online environment.
Students from across Massachusetts, in addition to a handful of young professionals and non-business graduate students, enrolled in CORe, or Credential of Readiness, a set of three accounting, economics of management, and analytics courses that comprised the initial offering of the HBX initiative over the summer. Between 20 and 30 percent of the enrollees were undergraduates at Harvard College, and the tuition for the courses, financial aid notwithstanding, was $1,500.
According to Bharat N. Anand, HBX faculty chair, the strong focus on student interaction and engagement through the platform, as well as the motivation arising from students having to pay tuition, largely drove the high completion rate. HBX’s rate starkly contrasts with that of many online courses, which often fall in the low single digits.
"Frankly, given that the intent behind this platform was to engage, we would've been disappointed with anything less than 75 percent, just going in," Anand said. "We were hoping that the engagement coming from the interactivity, the quality, and the social learning would stimulate people to finish the course."
The results of CORe student evaluations were comparable to those of the in-class evaluations given to MBA students at the Business School, he said. Students who enrolled in the program largely agreed with Anand's assessment of its success, and several students said that the online course was successful in capturing the peer interaction found in a physical classroom environment.
"This really felt that you were in an HBS classroom, but it was online," said Layla Siraj '16, a Crimson Arts editor, who recalled how she finished the first units for all three of the CORe courses within the first day of their release, despite being given two weeks to complete them.
Sietse K. Goffard '15, an economics concentrator and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, enrolled in CORe after Anand presented the program at a Council meeting last spring.
"I was especially interested in taking this because this program offered skills that Harvard College doesn't necessarily offer, like accounting," Goffard said, adding that he was more inclined to pursue business school after completing the program. "I never thought that such a high degree of interactivity was something that could be accomplished with something of this size. The high degree of interactiveness on the platform really stood out."
The first round of HBX's offerings was largely kept small in size and local in geographic scope, said Anand, in order to test the robustness and scalability of the platform's infrastructure. Several students noted that the server would often slow before the deadline for certain assignments, and that those deadlines were often extended as a result.
With those issues now largely resolved, however, Anand said that HBX has been preparing to rapidly expand. Just as the first round of course offerings ended in October, another round was commenced targeting companies that have enrolled their employees. He said that, in the near future, the initiative would also be broadened to a more international audience, and that it might even be integrated into the MBA and Executive Education branches of the school.
"There are many possibilities for how we can incorporate the HBX platform into our residential teaching, both for MBA and executive programs," he said. “We will explore various possibilities in the coming months.”
Yet, despite the marked success of the inaugural offering, the success of HBX was not guaranteed. As Business School Dean Nitin Nohria told an audience of students from the inaugural HBX cohort who assembled at the Business School on Sunday, even five years ago he refuted that online offerings would ever be a part of the Business School's arsenal.
"Five years ago, I literally stood there and declared that we would never do it, that we have this case method that is a unique, extraordinary form of learning," he said. "I couldn't possibly imagine how an online world could capture the magic of Harvard Business School. So it is especially humbling to stand here today in front of a group of pioneers who in so many ways have proven me wrong."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UDPATED: Nov. 4, 2014, at 2:40 a.m.
Dr. Kwonjune Seung, medical director of the Eugene Bell Foundation, a non-profit organization providing humanitarian assistance to North Korea, discussed his efforts to address North Korea’s tuberculosis crisis Monday.
The talk, given in Ticknor Lounge, addressed the motives behind the “5K for NK” fundraiser hosted by Harvard College student groups.
“We’ve been organizing this event since the beginning of the semester to spread the word about tuberculosis and to raise money for our 5K for NK event,” said Diana Im ’17, an event organizer. The fundraiser aims to raise $5,000 for the Bell Foundation to cure one patient with tuberculosis in North Korea, Im explained.
Seung, who has been working in North Korea for about 14 years, has continued to visit in an effort to deliver medicine to tuberculosis patients in the country.
Seung started by explaining that tuberculosis is an “extremely common disease all over the world” that is caused by airborne bacteria. The contagiousness of the disease makes it more dangerous for the people in North Korea, who often have to live in close quarters in rural houses for tuberculosis patients, he said.
“This is a disease that is hundreds and hundreds of years old,” and “it can go to other parts of your body,” Seung said. However, tuberculosis is not as commonly seen in the United States because “tuberculosis is a treatable disease,” he said.
The situation is different in North Korea. Despite the availability of antibiotics in North Korea, a tuberculosis epidemic still persists because, according to Seung, “the strains in North Korea are not normal strains of tuberculosis. You cannot cure it with the same drugs that are effective in other parts of the world.”
The Eugene Bell Foundation is working to fight against the epidemic by bringing drugs to North Korea that treat the mutant Multidrug-resistant TB strain. Seung discussed the impact of his work by explaining that “the numbers of tuberculosis patients that [the Foundation is] treating are far higher than anyone expected.”
The drugs are in extremely high demand and there is a long waiting list of people hoping to receive treatment, Seung said. He criticized the lack of initiative on the part of other non-profit organizations to deliver much needed drugs to North Korea.
“There is very little MDR-TB treatment going on outside of Eugene Bell,” Seung said, adding that there is a disproportionate demand-to-treatment ratio.

Last week, the Bertarelli Program, a collaboration between Harvard Medical School and the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, announced that it will award a series of grants totaling $3.6 million to launch five research projects in neuroengineering.
The five projects will launch in January, each a three-year partnership between doctors and scientists at HMS and bioengineers at EPFL.  Three of these projects will focus on developing new methods to diagnose and treat deafness, while the fourth will develop cell transplantation strategies to reverse blindness.  The fifth project will deal with difficulties in diagnosing children with autism.
“We wanted to link neuroscientists and engineers in order to bring the knowledge that has been developed in neuroscience over the last forty years to engineering solutions that help bring it to clinical practice,” said David J. Corey, director of the Bertarelli Program and an HMS professor of neurobiology.
Each project was allotted $720,000 to split between the two collaborating labs. According to Corey, this sum was chosen so that each lab could have $120,000 each year, which would be sufficient to completely support one person plus their annual expenses.  Each lab could then have one person completely dedicated to the project.
Jeffrey R. Holt, associate professor of Otology and Laryngology at HMS and a recipient of one of the grants, said he hopes to use the funding to develop gene therapy to treat inherited hearing loss. His project will focus on treating mutated genes in mice, as the mutations in their sensory cells also cause deafness in humans. His lab at the Boston Children’s Hospital will partner with a team at EPFL to introduce the properly formed genes into these ear cells, which undergo similar mutations to human cells.
“We are able to manipulate the genome of the virus, and then we can ‘engineer in’ the correct form of the gene that might cause deafness when mutated,” Holt said.  According to Holt, the Swiss group will be responsible for generating the viral vectors, which the inner ear specialists in Boston can then inject into the ears of the mice.
Corey said that the Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering chose the five projects to fund based partly on the possibility for clinical applications.  The projects were selected by a panel composed of representatives from both Harvard and EPFL, one of the goals being to advance research in the treatment of motor and sensory disorders.
“What we really hope is that each project will build on basic neuroscience, but use engineering strategies to bring that knowledge closer to clinical care,” Corey said.  “It’s a real chain that brings different expertise in each case.”

Researchers from Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have recently created a prototype test for the Ebola virus that has the potential to save doctors and patients time and money.
The test, developed by Professor James J. Collins and others at the Wyss Institute, can test for the virus in 30 minutes, with each test costing less than one dollar to produce. In comparison, the tool currently used to test for Ebola in human subjects takes multiple hours to determine results and costs up to $200.
The test works by dropping molecules found in human blood or saliva onto pieces of paper containing freeze-dried enzymes called “switches.” These enzymes turn yellow when in the presence of the Ebola virus, a color change clearly visible to the naked eye. The freeze-dried technology allows the test to be stored and distributed without the use of expensive refrigeration.
Keith I. Pardee, a research scientist at the Wyss Institute and the leader of Collins’ research team, said that researchers are working to make the paper test available for widespread use in hospitals and clinics within the next 12 months.
“These are still early days for the technology,” Pardee said. “It works well in the lab and has very high specificity. However, sensitivity needs to be increased to make it practical for use in the field.”
While the test yields very few false positives or negatives, its sensitivity needs to be increased in order to detect Ebola even if very few viral molecules are present within the blood or saliva.
This new technology could be used to detect a wide array of diseases, in addition to Ebola, potentially taking diagnostic testing out of the laboratory and into the field.

With the Harvard women’s volleyball team (15-4, 8-2 Ivy) playing its games on Halloween last weekend, sophomore setter Corinne Bain didn’t need to dress up for the matchups— she is already a monster on the court.
Bain served up a few of her tricks this weekend, booking her seventh triple-double with 11 kills, 21 assists, and 23 digs against Brown in a 3-1 win. The sophomore displayed her prowess the next day against archrival Yale after notching her eighth triple-double with 10 kills, 25 assists, and 15 digs in a three-set sweep of the Bulldogs. Her performance helped her team earn its seventh consecutive win and a first-place spot in the Ivy League.
For those keeping up with the Crimson, you will know this is nothing new for Bain. Not a game goes by where the second-year star’s presence isn’t felt on the court.
“It is hard to point out something especially remarkable from Corinne because she consistently brings so much intensity and competitiveness to every match she plays,” captain Caroline Walters said. “Her defense and specifically digging has improved a ton over the past few weeks and I think that was really crucial this weekend.”
The setter has amassed 379 kills, 1049 assists, 86 aces, 456 digs, and 89 solo and assisted blocks during her two-year career with the Crimson. She currently holds the record for single-season aces with 50 and has won seven Ivy League weekly awards.
Coming off a strong freshman season, Bain reminded everyone why she was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year and the No. 2 freshman in the NCAA. In the first regular season game against Santa Clara, she registered eight digs, four blocks, eight kills, and 27 assists.
“I think with a year of experience under my belt, I am able to play my game and be a leader on the court,” Bain said. “My position requires leadership and this year I feel confident enough to lead my teammates in high-pressure matches.”
The setter has continued to improve since the season began. So far, she has 12 triple-doubles and 27 double-doubles under her belt, two coming this past weekend.
“She definitely leads by example and influences everyone else to play with more intent,” Walters said. “She also motivates people with her words on court and her attitude makes people want to really step up and do their jobs.”
This past weekend wasn’t the first time Yale struggled to deal with the sophomore star. In the team’s first match against the Bulldogs this season, Bain recorded another triple-double with 11 kills, 32 assists, and 12 digs. She also had a season-best six aces.
“It felt amazing and most importantly, rewarding,” Bain said of sweeping the Elis. “We have been working so hard for this and it was such a rewarding experience to beat Yale in their own gym.”
As the team approaches the last few games of Ivy League play against Princeton, Penn, Cornell, and Columbia, the Crimson will need Bain’s skills to maintain its place at the top.
“She has always been something of a natural leader on the court because of her competitive nature and personality,” Walters said. “The team can always trust her to perform and she always has a constant and strong on-court presence that others can look to. She is very consistent in her attitude and approach.”
With only three seniors on the team, Bain has taken on a leadership role as an underclassman.  Leadership has come naturally to the Manhattan Beach, Calif., native, Walters noted, who was a force to be reckoned with on her high school team.
“I think Corinne has a bright future ahead of her and she is right on her way to becoming even more of a leader to this team,” Walters added. “Her drive and competitive spirit leave me with no doubt that she will continue to have a strong and lasting impact on the team and the program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The Harvard sailing team competed in three regattas this weekend, including the Schell Trophy, where the squad qualified for the Fall 2014 Atlantic Coast Championship.
74TH PROFESSOR ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
The Crimson’s strongest performance on the water came in the Schell Trophy, hosted by the University of Vermont on Lake Champlain. Harvard took sixth place out of the 18 colleges and universities who participated in the competition.
This two-day regatta featured FJ racing and four sailors represented Harvard across the two divisions.
Senior Brian Drumm was joined by juniors Marek Zaleski and Jacob Bradt in the A division, where the Crimson took tenth place. Bradt rotated with junior co-captains Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky in the B division, where they placed fourth.
“Overall, this weekend went well,” Bradt said. “This was our qualifier for the Atlantic Coast Championship, which is set to take place in a couple of weeks and is by far the most important regatta of the fall season, so our primary goal going into this past weekend was to be amongst the top eight teams, thus qualifying for the final event of the season.”
Harvard finished in sixth place overall with a combined total of 151 points. Boston College finished on top in this regatta with 89 points total.
It was a windy weekend up in Burlington and the Crimson noticed the impact of the conditions on its racing.
“A lot of teams gave up a significant amount of points on Sunday by simply not being able to sail fast in the windy and wavy weather or by making little mistakes that were only magnified given the conditions,” Bradt said. “We tried to approach these tricky conditions by keeping things simple: keeping the boat moving fast, not taking too many risks on the starting line--just generally focusing on the basics.”
Despite qualifying for the Atlantic Coast Championship, the team can improve according to Bradt.
“A weakness that plagued us early in the weekend was not picking up on the paradigm of success,” Bradt said. “It seemed as though we were a step behind the ball when it came to picking up on what was working, what the key to success was in a given race.”
VICTORIAN COFFEE URN TROPHY
Harvard finished in 11th place out of 18 teams this weekend at the Victorian Coffee Urn Regatta hosted by Dartmouth. The conditions in New Hampshire were quite cold with strong winds on Sunday, which made being on the water a challenge for all sailors maneuvering their boats. There were 15 capsizes on Sunday alone.
The stronger performance came from junior Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis in the B division. The duo finished in fourth place. Freshman Taylor Ladd and junior Kristina Jakobson finished in 16th place for the A division.
NICKERSON TROPHY
Harvard also raced in the Nickerson Trophy hosted by Tufts University. Sailing took place over two days in this inter-conference regatta and the boats being sailed were larks.
Despite finishing in seventh place in both the A and B divisions, the Crimson came in eighth place overall for the regatta.
“Our strengths were definitely staying in phase and playing the shifts properly while getting out to the pressure early,” freshman Dylan Farrell said.
The weather in Arlington, MA was much like what was faced in Vermont and New Hampshire for the rest of the squad.
“I thought the weekend went pretty well overall given the conditions,” Farrell said.
Despite the wind and the cold air, there were no protests or breakdowns in the rotations.
Farrell was joined by freshman Kirstin Anderson in the B division. Freshman Nick Sertl and sophomore Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj paired up for the A division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, sophomore setter Corie Bain earned The Crimson’s athlete of the week award by helping her team vault into first place in the Ivy League with wins over Yale and Brown. Bain racked up at least 10 kills, 15 digs, and 20 assists in each game, giving hers a triple-double in eight of the team’s 19 games.
While Bain’s performance was impressive, several other Crimson athletes contributed in major ways to victories this past week:
Miye D’Oench, Women’s Ice Hockey
A year after leading the Harvard women’s hockey team with 21 goals and 18 assists, junior Miye D’Oench picked up right where she left off. She scored two goals in each of the team’s first two home contests against the Rensselaer Red Hawks and the Union Dutchmen to help the Crimson open the season with consecutive wins.
D’Oench scored the first and the last goal against the Red Hawks in a 4-1 win. In addition to an unassisted finish late in the first period, she scored on an empty net with a minute and a half remaining to cement the victory.
Against the Dutchmen, D’Oench’s goals, both of which came in the second period, erased a 1-0 Union lead. The scores opened the floodgates for the Crimson offense, as the team scored three more goals in the frame and rolled to a 5-2 victory.
Patrick McNally, Men’s Ice Hockey
In the home opener of the Harvard men’s ice hockey season, Patrick McNally made sure that Crimson fans would not leave disappointed. The senior defenseman scored two goals against visiting Dartmouth, including a late equalizer that helped the team earn a 3-3 tie.
Nine minutes into the third period, McNally hit a slap shot from the edge of the attacking zone that found the lower right corner. He celebrated with a double fist pump.
The goal was only his second most impressive of the day. With the score knotted at 1-1 in the second period, McNally collected the puck in the Harvard defensive zone, split two defenders, and raced to the other end for an unassisted goal.
Paul Stanton, Football
Harvard football is still undefeated, and junior running back Paul Stanton is a big reason why. Behind Stanton’s career-high 180 rushing yards, the Crimson fought to a 23-12 victory over Dartmouth.
Stanton, who averaged 7.5 yards per carry on Saturday, also scored two touchdowns. His three-yard run in the first quarter capped off a 75-yard drive; his two-yard plunge in the second gave Harvard a 20-6 lead.
Despite playing only five of seven games, Stanton is second in the Ancient Eight with 563 yards on the season. He has scored six touchdowns.

After a fall season spent largely on the road, the Harvard men’s tennis team returned home for Halloween weekend, hosting the UTR Metro Open at the Murr Center.
Though much of the team did not participate in the tournament--which was open to college players as well as local professional players--those who did participate performed well, highlighted by co-captain Alex Steinroeder’s run to the final of the Flight A draw.
The senior took down Army’s Sam Lampman, 6-4, 6-1, before besting freshman teammate Jean Thirouin, 6-4, 6-7, 1-0(9), and former Crimson tennis player Christo Schultz--a senior who has exhausted his four years of eligibility--6-4, 6-2.
He then fell to Harshana Godamanna, a local professional, in three sets.
“This tournament was just a good chance to get some guys some extra matches,” Steinroeder said. “A couple of the local guys were very good players, and it’s always good to get more competition in before the end of the fall.”
Beyond Steinroeder’s performance, senior Shaun Chaudhuri also performed well for the Crimson. After falling in the second round of the Flight A draw to Schultz, he went on to win the consolation draw, taking the final by the score of 6-0, 6-4.
Sophomore Sebastian Beltrame and Thirouin also each advanced to the second round of the Flight A draw, while sophomore Andrew Ball went down in the first round.
The tournament represented a small step in the team’s preparation for the main spring season, according to Chaudhuri.
“This was just another stepping stone for us, another way to improve in certain areas of our games,” Chaudhuri said. “Fall season is just about improving each day as a tennis player. You really have to take ownership over your own game, and put in the long hours now.
The spring season is fast approaching, though. Harvard has just one more weekend remaining in its fall season. The majority of the team will wrap up the fall at the William and Mary Tribe Invite.
Co-captain Denis Nguyen, who earned All-American honors last season, and sophomore Brian Yeung will represent Harvard at the ITA Indoor Intercollegiate Championships.
“It’s really exciting that Brian and Denis are competing [at the ITA Championships],” Steinroeder said. “And the rest of the guys will get some good competition next weekend to give us a little momentum going into the offseason.”

Welcome to the Love Edition of Listen Up! Your trusted Flyby advisers—two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting juniors—are back with the latest advice and invaluable counsel: on your love lives.
We’ve always felt strongly that November 4th is the Valentine’s day of autumn. So cuddle up close to that special someone (or if you’re like any of the people who submitted questions, cuddle up with a body pillow), and enjoy the most romantic blog post of your life.
Oh, and don’t forget to submit your questions here or scroll down to the form below. We know you have problems. We have answers.
Why am I strangely attracted to the John Harvard statue?
This may be the first question that leaves us truly at a loss to answer. We can’t begin to imagine why you are attracted to the John Harvard statue. Is it his pee-soaked extremities? The fact that you love being photographed by crowds of tourists while you get down and dirty? Or that you’re just strangely attracted to pathological liars? None of those seem like good enough reasons for us.
How do I break the ice with the hottie in my house who I stare at from across the dhall? I'm just a girl that's probably way out of her league.
You just described the exact problem that plagues our daily existence. Literally 90 percent of our lives are spent in Adams Dining Hall, debating whether or not go to into the servery because we are terrified that we might awkwardly encounter the loves of our lives.
Believe it or not, dining halls have fostered almost as many relationships as Taylor Swift has ended. Here are two tips on turning up the heat at your next meal.
First, choose sexual foods. The path to romantic success begins in the servery, so stay away from your soups, cakes, and pastas. When was the last time that someone slurping clam chowder was sexy? Probably the same time that T-Swift was in a healthy relationship.
Second, pick your seat carefully. As with everything we have ever learned about social interactions, Mean Girls taught us that nothing is as important in the dining hall as location, location, location. Personally, our favorite technique is to scope out where your crush puts her things down and wait for her to go and grab food. While she’s gone, put your own stuff down next to her, and then just pretend “you didn’t see her things.” It’s the easiest way to make the jump from the creepy person who stares from across the room to the creepy person sitting next to her.
How do I deal with seeing my Tinder matches in lecture? What about when they're the professor giving the lecture??
It can be awkward to see your Tinder matches in person. Your interactions thus far have been limited to swiping right, and making the transition to the three-dimensional world can be challenging to say the least—how are these images moving independent of my thumbs?!
When using Tinder, never lose sight of its ultimate goal: to eventually meet these individuals in person. Don’t swipe left or right just for no reason but to exercise your thumbs. Trust us, there are far betters ways out there to up your piano game from Schubert to Rachmaninoff. Tinder is a social contract. By swiping right, you make a promise to see that person in the future (that’s how it works, right?). So if you “can’t even deal” with seeing your Tinder matches in lecture, in Greenhouse Cafe, at the Registrar’s office, where have you, you shouldn’t swipe at all. Good rule of thumb: if you rather be bit by a mite, you better not swipe right.
*Also, your professor situation seems like it might be a serious violation of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ sexual assault policy. Like, for real. You should really check up on that and talk to experts. History Professor Alison F. Johnson knows just about everything anyone could possibly know about the policy. We’re sure she would be happy to shine some light on the matter.
How do I get a date for winter formal. SERIOUS ANSWER PLEASE.
First of all, every answer we give is serious. How dare you imply otherwise. The nerve of some people… If you keep this skepticism up, you’ll never get a date for winter formal.
Winter formal is tricky situation this year. With most of the houses hosting their formals on the same night, a self-segregating phenomenon is at hand. Your best shot is probably a date from your own house. Here are some tips:
Plus, if you really get desperate, Steven and I are available. But we’re not sure if you want to stoop that low.
Ready for another classic love life question? I like guy, pretty sure guy might like me back, but guy is shy. So I asked him out for a casual, "just as friends" lunch in one of the dhalls, and we ended up talking for like 2 hours. And now it's been a week, and I really want to push this friendship (and then eventually romance) more, but idk if asking him for another meal is too desperate. Halp. :(
Clearly we have different definitions of desperate. If we were in your shoes, we probably would have proposed by now. Definitely go for it and ask for another meal. Once he says yes, follow up with our favorite emoji: the kissy face.  Just send along one of those babies and you’re all set to take this relationship to the next level.
Love life solved? Great, send in your deepest thoughts, your weirdest phobias, and slightly gross habits in for Dev and Steve to tackle. Keep the questions coming!

Or if you want to add your voice to important dialogues and learn about potential internships and post-grad opportunities, I guess this is for you too. Or if you just want to dress up as the giant penis. Takes all kinds.Wednesday, 4 p.m. Ticknor Lounge
Fifty Shades of False: Kink, Fantasy, and Fetish. Are you excited to see Fifty Shades of Grey in theaters? Well don't be. It's full of lies. How can this be, you say? I don't know, the panel isn't until Thursday. Come if you want to pretentiously judge your friends or the people who read it on the bus with a fake book jacket, but aren't fooling anyone.Thursday, 4:30 p.m. Sever 106
Open Mic. By Thursday night you'll probably have had some defining experiences and be looking for an outlet to express them through. Or maybe you just want to snag some free food at this casual sex (week) event.Thursday, 8 p.m. Dudley Co-op
Love at First Swipe. Ever get matched on Tindr with a cute boy/girl only to them realize it's your professor and not really know what to do about that? If so, send me an email and we can hash this out. Or we can meet on Saturday at this thing, and hopefully figure it all out by the end of the panel.Saturday, 4:30 p.m. Sever 113
About That Elephant. You thought sex was weird, but what about elephant sex? I'm pretty sure they didn't cover that in sex ed. And if they did, please write in, we want to meet you. But for the rest of us I think this will be a really enlightening about the personal lives of our Loxodontan friends. There's a slight chance that this is a poetry duo performance, but I'm pretty sure that's a typo. Come to Sever 113 on Saturday to find out for yourself.Saturday, 8 p.m. Sever 113
Whether you spend Sex Week giggling like a middle schooler at every reference to a private part, or learning from a host of fantastic presenters in a week of educational and thought-provoking events, I want to leave you with one thought. Get as many free condoms as humanly possible. Condoms are crazy expensive.
