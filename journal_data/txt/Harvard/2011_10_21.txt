After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Globalization may be an overused term, but it is certainly one of the defining ideas of our time. The internet allows us to connect instantly with people across the world. Our generation is poised to enter a workforce that is more transnational in character than any other. Our university itself is growing more international. Harvard College is enrolling record numbers of students from outside the U.S.; international students make up 11 percent in the class of 2015. Increasing numbers of Harvard students go abroad each January and summer break, and this geographic spread will likely extend to post-graduation careers in the near future.
In this context, it is fitting that Harvard chose Fareed Zakaria (Ph.D ’93) to speak at the 2012 commencement ceremony.  Zakaria has used his position as a public intellectual to encourage American readers to look beyond the nation’s borders and think of current issues in a broader, more cosmopolitan way.
For example, his much-cited Newsweek cover story in October 2001, “Why Do They Hate Us?” changed the post-9/11 discourse in America for the better. By incorporating modern Middle Eastern history into its causality narrative, Zakaria argued that Islamic extremism did not come from envy, resentment, or essential evil but rather increasing state corruption and incompetence in the Middle East and regional public perception of the United States’s role in this process. It is a deft and compelling argument. Moreover, Zakaria showed true courage of conviction in voicing it in such a sensitive environment.
Additionally, Zakaria is one of a rare breed of public intellectual who combines genuine intellect with the ability to communicate effectively with a large audience.  His work at Newsweek and Time amply demonstrates his ability to refine complex ideas for mass consumption without degrading their content.
We applaud Harvard for selecting as Commencement speaker Zakaria, who is both a public intellectual and journalist. As Harvard students, we are proud to see a well—known voice take the podium, and we are excited to hear what Zakaria will have to say about anti-Wall Street sentiment, the destabilization of Europe’s financial markets, and whatever other international crises come up between now and May. Furthermore, we at the Crimson believe that journalists are essential to the intellectual vitality of our community, and we are happy to see one of our own recognized.
In an age when the birth and expansion of the blogosphere has meant that unprecedented numbers of people are able to publish news analysis and commentary—with both positive and negative consequences—it is important to pay homage to the few authoritative voices left. Zakaria is not only a foremost example of such an authoritative voice on foreign policy, but he is also a dynamic thinker who will impart important wisdom on our graduating seniors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2010, Harvard cancelled the Doctoral Child Care Student Scholarship Program, a pilot program aimed at graduate student parents with a household income below $80,000. Representatives of the University told The Crimson that the program was not benefitting enough people and that a working group was “actively exploring new strategies to support doctoral student parents.”
But rather than expand the program or set up an equivalent, the University now offers no financial support for its graduate student parents. This has widened an already enormous gap in privileges offered to the schools’ faculty and its students. Such a lack of support is distressing and destructive. Harvard must support its student parents by extending the benefits currently offered only to faculty.
Harvard does a tremendous job of providing for faculty and staff with children. Harvard employees are eligible to set aside $5,000 pre-tax in order to pay for child care. Ladder faculty—that is to say assistant, associate, and full professors—who have a household income of less than $175,000—can receive up to $20,000 a year if they have children under the age of six. There’s also a program for back-up emergency care. Faculty can even apply to grants for extra travel expenses so that children can accompany their parents on academic trips away from Cambridge. Such initiatives may well be  partly accountable in part for the growing number of female professors.
But for graduate students in doctoral programs—that is, those studying to become professors—the picture is strikingly different. Not considered full employees of the University, graduate students are ineligible for the child care support offered to its staff. The cost of child care at a Harvard—affiliated care center—around $2,000 a month and more for infants—often surpasses a graduate school stipend, about $20,000 a year, depending on the division. Harvard does not have a consistent parental leave policy for its graduate students, so what resources are available is up to the whim of the department. One student I talked to received a paid maternity leave and her own office where she could nurse; another was told that if she gave birth immediately before exam period, she would still have to act as a proctor.
The weight of Harvard’s current policies falls disproportionally on women. According to a survey put together by a number of graduate students in 2008, about 30 percent of student fathers had a stay—at—home partner; no student mother had a stay—at—home partner. And where most fathers took less than a month off or no time at all, only 15 percent of student mothers were able to return to work a month after giving birth.
The survey, of course, does not account for women who left their graduate programs after realizing that it would not support their needs or those who never applied, figuring becoming an academic and raising a child were incompatible.
Harvard is well aware of the important role affordable child care plays in retaining women in academia. The 2005 Report from the Task Force on Women in Science and Engineering stated that “child care needs influence many women to drop out of the academic pipeline,” and urged the University to “create new childcare scholarships for doctoral students and increase the amount awarded to postdoctoral fellows.” “Before the financial crisis struck in 2008, GSAS was close to approving a proposal for expanded assistance to graduate student parents,” Jeff Neal, an FAS spokesperson wrote in an email.
But since then, the school has not put forth a full support system, citing the financial crisis as a pretext. “Our emphasis now is on helping students meet their needs by making sure we are fully exploiting existing resources and by opening robust lines of communication with departments,” Neal wrote.
This pretext does not hold up to scrutiny. Most universities of equivalent academic caliber and with smaller endowments, such as MIT and Stanford, offer paid maternity leave to student mothers; Princeton offers up to $5,000 of child care support to any student parent. As an extreme example, the University of California at Berkeley, whose state educational system has been going through a severe crunch, reserves spaces in its child care programs for student parents, on a sliding scale, and gives up to $900 a semester in reimbursements.
By contrast, the only real service offered by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is a “G-clock extension,” by which the administration’s measure of a student’s progress can be held for one year. This is hardly a solution; it is not equivalent to paid parental leave. Harvard’s most recent innovation—a website called the WATCH Portal (launched last week)—“connects parents and student caregivers” but offers no financial aid. It almost goes without saying that the other resources noted in an email from Neal—mentoring, advising, and “family friendly activities” at Dudley House—do not in any concrete way address the fact that, without economic support, the University is tacitly asking women to choose between parenting and an academic career.
Harvard must offer support on all levels of academic development, not just once its students become faculty. An extension of existing benefits would not only aid current student parents but also increase the diversity of future faculty. Otherwise, the University might as well be blunt about its implicit position: Female students can’t have children if they hope to advance in academia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most freshmen arrive at Harvard having succeeded in a variety of subjects in high school. Those who preferred their math classes often also had significant interests in history and English, and vice versa. Under Harvard’s academic system, however, students do not maintain this same academic balance during their undergraduate careers. The College should abolish the antiquated and misleading concentration system to better adhere to the ideals of a liberal arts education.
When Charles W. Eliot became University president in 1869, he eliminated all requirements for undergraduates, turning Harvard’s education system into one that was entirely elective based. Many students graduated having only taken introductory classes on a variety of topics.
In 1910, however, President A. Lawrence Lowell introduced the concentration system, which is now a cornerstone of the Harvard education and the educations of many other institutions internationally. Presumably, Lowell’s intentions were to allow his students to focus on one area and develop a mastery of its subject matter while gaining a broad base in the arts and sciences. This was an admirable goal, but in today’s educational context Harvard must change the way it pursues it.
Concentration requirements both narrow the scope of our education and allow some students to graduate without ever immersing themselves in the intellectual experience. Some concentrators make the most of their degree, writing theses and even going on to graduate school. Others fulfill only the minimum requirements and have a shallower understanding of their discipline than motivated students from other fields. For example, an art history concentrator could take Economics 1011a and have a deeper understanding of microeconomics than an economics concentrator who is on an easier track.
Our campus culture is increasingly pre-professional, and there is a fear that prospective employers will not look past our concentration at the classes we have taken, to realize that the gaming one’s concentration classes  occurs. That alone encourages students to take the easiest of the required classes in their concentration and discourages them from taking difficult classes purely out of interest. Indeed, under the current concentration system some of the only students receiving a truly well-rounded liberal-arts education are pre-medical students concentrating in the humanities or social sciences.
Harvard has tried to combat overspecialization by mandating that students take Gen Ed classes in eight different areas, but this does not combat the central problem that many students simply will not take challenging, engaging classes if there is a risk of getting a low grade. Even the most motivated students crowd into the easiest Gen Ed classes, all the while complaining of these classes’ simplicity or boasting of their ease.
Moreover, the College does not logistically hinder students from taking difficult courses outside their concentrations. Few departments are exclusive in their enrollment, and as the success of CS 50 shows, it is possible to engage students out of their concentrations.
It may be argued that the presence of secondary fields and language citations is meant to encourage students to venture outside their concentration fields. However, few students seem to continue language classes after earning a citation and few students seem to take classes beyond their secondary field requirements.
Abolishing concentrations may make the College look overly permissive to outsiders, but with a strong advising system it could work well. Without concentrations, more students would explore freely, take a wider variety of more difficult classes, and still be able to pursue recommended departmental structures, if they really wanted to. Should a student want to focus in a field and distinguish himself or herself for employers and graduate schools, prospective employers would be forced to look at the content of a transcript, rather than the meaningless titles on a diploma.
Students need not take introductory classes in every single discipline. However, abolishing concentration requirements will enable undergraduates to explore different fields and develop and expand their intellect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For all the initial hoopla surrounding the supposed audacity of President Obama’s new, Trumanesque approach to reelection, the political strategy behind it is rather timid. After all, the president’s American Jobs Act was designed to be a fail-safe ploy to demonstrate his support for—and his opponents’ instinctive hostility toward—what amounts to little more than voter candy: payroll tax cuts, support for firefighters, police officers, and teachers, and the chimerical promise of deficit neutrality. However, while it was designed to be fail-safe, it was not designed to be foolproof, and it is now a confederacy of such unforeseen fools that threaten to derail the president’s best—laid plans.
The fools in question are Democratic moderates. It is ironic that while the strategy for the jobs bill was intended to expose immoderation as a political liability for the Republican Party, it has instead exposed moderation as a greater political liability for the Democrats. On Oct. 12, a majority of the United States Senate voted in favor of the American Jobs Act but failed to reach the 60-vote benchmark to break the Republican filibuster, effectively killing the bill. Two Democrats, however, broke ranks and gave Republican obstruction a bipartisan fig leaf: Nebraska’s Ben Nelson and Montana’s Jon Tester. Both men are up for reelection in 2012, and both men threatened to vote the same way on upcoming votes on the bill’s constitutive elements. The bill and its political message were also undermined by Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Jim Webb of Virginia who blasted its contents in spite of voting yea.
The sight of flailing red-state Democrats throwing their party under the bus in the vain hope that their conservative constituents will reward them for it is at once comic and tragic. In the great 2010 midterm massacre, 20 of the 34 House Democrats who voted against Obamacare were defeated anyway, and in all likelihood, Nelson and Tester’s nay votes last week will prove similarly futile in 2012. Opposition to the Iraq War wasn’t enough to save moderate Republicans like Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee and Connecticut Congressman Chris Shays in 2006, either. The fact is that in the polarized environment of modern American politics, the two parties generally rise and fall as collective entities, regardless of individual heresies.
Time after time, voters have demonstrated that the better a party’s political standing, the better the political standing of individual members of that party, moderate or radical. And yet, time after time, a beleaguered party is further plagued by a cadre of suicidally self-interested centrists who only worsen the plight of both their party and themselves by jumping ship. If this political nonconformism were borne out of principle rather than expedience, it would be admirable. But invariably, one can predict when the so-called “mavericks” will crawl out of the woodwork by the proximity of the next election and the condition of the party brand.
Most aggravating, however, is how this flavor of spineless, milquetoast centrism is put on a pedestal by the likes of holier-than-thou, armchair moderates like New York Times columnists David Brooks and Thomas Friedman. These self-appointed arbiters of the political center are in reality nothing more than shameless apologists for the Beltway cult of conventional wisdom. To them, the center is quite literally the midpoint between the extremes of both parties, a fallacy that is dangerously susceptible to false equivalences, totally neglects objective, historical standards of what constitutes the “mainstream” and worst of all, obsesses over symbolism rather than substance.
A classic example of such false equivalence and total divorce from objectivity and history was displayed by Friedman in an exceptionally vapid—even by his own standards—piece in which he wrote, “Do I feel that Republicans have tried to make President Obama fail from Day 1? Yes, I do. And their dabbling with another government shutdown now is pure madness. But the president is not blameless. He walked away from his own Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission, which still could be the foundation for a sane Grand Bargain.”
Friedman’s equating of President Obama’s decision not to symbolically embrace the specific provisions of the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan with Republican threats to allow the United States to default and thus devastate the global economy—in spite of obvious indications of the president’s obsession with obtaining a Grand Bargain during negotiations with House Speaker John Boehner—is among the dumber things Friedman has written over the years. Friedman’s argument is built on the premise that both parties must be equally culpable for the failure to obtain a Grand Bargain, reality be damned, for only a partisan would ever suggest that one side was more unreasonable than the other.
Brooks, likewise, betrayed the shallowness of his thinking in a column responding to President Obama’s September jobs speech, writing, “The president is sounding like the Al Gore for President campaign, but without the earth tones. Tax increases for the rich! Protect entitlements! People versus the powerful! I was hoping the president would give a cynical nation something unconventional, but, as you know, I’m a sap.”
Brooks does not deny that there was nothing remotely radical or especially liberal about the substance of the speech or that there was nothing in it that candidate Obama of 2008—once the object of Brooks’ affection—did not support. All that was different was the president’s more defiant tone, which was inevitable and justified after three years of unrequited bipartisan overtures. And that alone sufficed for Brooks to title his piece “Obama Rejects Obamaism.”
Brooks’ semi-sarcastic admission of sappiness should not, in fact, be sarcastic. He is a sap, and his feel-good, faux centrism bears no resemblance to true centrism. Centrism should not feel good at all but should instead come at great political cost, entail great political risk, and demand great political courage. This is the kind of governing-focused centrism practiced by the members of the Simpson-Bowles Commission and, yes, President Obama. There is nothing brave about a centrism that focuses on optics and self-interest. In fact, recent history shows that this style of false moderation only empowers radicalism; if it weren’t for the likes of Tester, Nelson, Brooks, and Friedman, it wouldn’t be so easy for Republicans to nudge that cherished center ever rightward and make it ever harder for real centrists to get credit for their political sacrifice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1673, Harvard was facing a succession crisis.
Harvard had been established just 37 years earlier, and, in the winter of 1673, it faced one of the most serious threats in its early history. Increase Mather had just returned from England after a stint there advocating on behalf of Puritan freedoms when the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, had appointed him one of its members. And, after the resignation of Leonard Hoar, the Corporation asked Mather to take on the position of president. Mather politely declined.
Born in 1639 to Richard and Katherine Mather, Increase Mather followed in the footsteps of his family’s religious heritage. The Mather clan was part of a group of prominent and influential families in the first colonies of New England. Richard Mather, an Oxford scholar and minister, assisted in the Puritan journey to the new world and subsequent establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
Although Increase Mather would go on to play a crucial role in the development of Harvard College, in 1673, Mather was less than willing to lead the University. Mather was the second oldest of five  brothers. In 1651, at the age of 12, he began at Harvard, intending to carry on his father’s spiritual work. After graduating in 1656, Mather began his work in the church, preaching his first sermon at 18.
Mather left Massachusetts in 1657 to study in Ireland, where he attained a masters degree from Trinity College and continued his work as a chaplain at Guernsey until 1661. He returned to America the following year to pursue a more significant religious post and began preaching to the Second Church of Boston upon his arrival. Back in Massachusetts, he married Maria Cotton and was ordained in 1664. Increase strongly opposed the popular practicing of the half-way covenant, which sought to lower the requirements of church membership, and took part in a campaign to reestablish and reform New England from the evils of liberalism. In his stringent Puritanism, Mather was a representative of the College’s early religious heritage, and his ideological conviction would feature heavily in his later life when he found himself embroiled in the Salem witch trials.
When Mather finally agreed to take on the presidency, his ambivalence toward the job was clear. Harvard’s top brass had made a point of wanting a president who lived on campus, but Mather refused to move to Cambridge. As president, he spent a total of three months in close proximity to the University during his eight years in office.
Not surprisingly, Mather’s energies often seemed focused on issues far removed from the confines of Cambridge. During Mather’s tenure as president, King James II of England attempted to reform New England’s colonial economy and flush out the Puritan influence, making the College a primary area for the debate and contest over American colonial identity. Mather’s time as president was widely criticized for the time he spent lobbying against the King’s revocation of the charter of Massachusetts (a document that established the legality of the College itself).
But when his attention turned toward Harvard, Mather worked to Puritanize much of his alma mater’s curriculum and rules. According to historian Samuel Morrison, Mather restored instruction in Greek and Hebrew and emphasized the use of Biblical and Christian writings in ethics courses. He also rewrote college laws requiring students to reside in dormitories and have regular attendance at meals and in lectures.
By 1691, the sun began to set on Mather’s tenure as president. By that year—his last as president—had racked up enormous debts while traveling. In the process, he had lost much of his authority and control in the church and at Harvard. The College’s General Court presented him with an ultimatum—move to Cambridge or resign the presidency. He acquiesced, only to move back to Boston six months later. With that, his time as president ended.
At this time, the accusations against Salem women as so-called “witches” had just begun, and Mather left to restrain the court in Salem. Mather came under criticism for his delay in using his considerable moral authority against the trials, as he supported the jury that finally decided to hang 19 innocent people in 1692. During this time and after the hangings, however, Mather wrote many sermons relating his distrust of spectral evidence to convict witches. His own daughter was even accused of witchcraft at one point, which resulted in his immediate decision to advocate against the execution of “witches.” In one of his most famous sermons, “Cases of conscience concerning Evil Spirits,” he argued that “better ten witches go free than the blood of a single innocent be shed,” a phrase that would later be known as Blackstone’s formulation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1883, Elizabeth Cary Agassiz asked the Massachusetts elite to donate to her controversial cause of ladies’ education by explaining the difference between what was affectionately known as the Harvard Annex and its sister institutions:
“It may, and no doubt will, be asked, why we desire to establish a college for women in Cambridge when several successful ones exist elsewhere; when we have Vassar, the Boston University, Smith, and Wellesley. We readily admit that such a college would be both undesirable and superfluous, unless we can connect it directly with Harvard College. Failing this, we should miss the distinctive thing for which we have aimed.”
Bold words. Slightly more than a decade before, President Charles W. Eliot had dismissed any notion of Harvard’s duty to educate women, saying in 1869, “The world knows next to nothing about the natural mental capacities of the female sex.” Still, there were attempts to address the matter. In 1871, the Women’s Education Association of Boston decided to organize a conference on women’s education for the following year and again were rebuffed by University professors and officials. Their minutes note: “We were told not to disturb the present system of education, which is the result of the wisdom and experience of the past, and bears so large a part in the molding of our republican life.”
The late nineteenth century saw a growing interest in female higher education: All of the Seven Sisters, save Radcliffe, were granted college charters before 1890. Of those six, only Barnard gave the degree of a men’s college (Columbia). The remaining schools were independent.
Just as Harvard has the reputation of always doing things differently, so, too, did Radcliffe. The college finally obtained a charter in 1894. Its tardiness to do so, and the unconventional nature of a Radcliffe degree countersigned by Harvard’s president, is a remnant of its founders’ long-term goal: to provide women with a Harvard education.
Radcliffe College’s founding was the work of many, but Agassiz carried the energy and vision needed to grapple with Harvard’s administration. The wife of famed naturalist Louis Agassiz, she spent her later years as the voice of a revolutionary movement looking to gain the endorsement of America’s oldest bastion of higher education. Agassiz’s efforts would help establish an institution with official connections to Harvard that provided women with an education on par with their Harvard counterparts and the credibility of a degree countersigned by the University’s president. She then presided over that institution for its first decade.
Elizabeth Agassiz was born in Boston in 1822. A sickly child, she was homeschooled. She met her husband, a widower, through her sister, the wife of a Harvard professor, and was married in 1850. Agassiz’s first brush with educational leadership came in 1855, when the couple established a girls’ school to augment their income. The school closed in 1863; in 1865, the couple went to Brazil, resulting in the famous 1867 publication of “A Journey in Brazil,” derived from her notes on his research. After her husband, for whom she acted as editor, secretary, and confidante, died in 1873, Agassiz devoted herself to her cause: female education at Harvard. In 1879 she joined the committee that would become The Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, known as the Harvard Annex.
Prior to the establishment of the Annex, a small group of motivated women had been able to form associations with professors, enter special courses of instruction, pursue individual graduate-level work, attend summer school, and sit for separate examinations. Harvard professors had long supplemented their wages by instructing interested women, while the University itself offered various programs of study, without the promise of an actual degree, throughout the nineteenth century. But by the 1870s, with the advent of a growing public debate on formalized female education, informal options for these women, often the wives, sisters, and daughters of Harvard’s intellectuals, dwindled.
The Annex began with 27 students, most pursuing advanced study, and 13 professors, repeating their Harvard lectures. It was based in a Cambridge residence, and local families hosted students. The committee hastened to assure Harvard that despite its meager beginnings, aid was unnecessary. Arthur Gilman, the committee secretary, wrote to Eliot: “The ladies are all opposed to coeducation and […] very glad to make the experiment without involving Harvard, but when success has been achieved we shall be glad to give the glory to her.”
Though the Annex offered no degree, the public and press latched onto the Annex as the first step, or mis-step, in bringing women to the school. While some applauded the group’s compromises in establishing the program, others demanded stronger engagement with the University. The committee opted for the former path and, in 1882, the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women was founded, with Agassiz as president, in order to raise an endowment. Despite difficulty fundraising, Agassiz refused to consider the establishment of a separate school with its own faculty, maintaining that entrance to Harvard would come in time.
The school’s pecuniary problems persisted, and, in 1893, after much work by the committee, Agassiz entered into talks with Eliot and the Harvard Corporation about the Annex’s future. Harvard’s reply to the committee’s offer, which included fully transferring its endowment and its property to Harvard, was lukewarm. Harvard’s treasurer wrote, “I have no prejudice in the matter of education of women and am quite willing to see Yale or Columbia take any risks they like, but I feel bound to protect Harvard College from what seems to me to be a risky experiment.”
After some negotiation, the Corporation agreed to the founding of a separate college that granted degrees countersigned by Harvard’s president. Eliot suggested naming it after Lady Mowlson, née Ann Radcliffe, whom the University had just rediscovered as its first female donor. Radcliffe was formally established in 1893 but, as with every step, the committee’s compromise provoked debate. In 1894, the Harvard Board of Overseers voted to ensure that no women should be granted either a Harvard A.B. or post-graduate degree, while Annex alumnae decried the college’s establishment and its new ties to the university down the street.
At that year’s Commencement, Agassiz urged graduates to be worthy of the new connection:
“It is my dearest wish for you all that Radcliffe College by her bearing [...] by her simplicity and refinement of manners, by her fidelity to scholarship in its more comprehensive and liberal sense, should worthily serve the older institution by which she is adopted. This trust is yours, and I hope you will hand it down to successive classes, enriched by traditions of your own, such as may befit association with what is best and noblest in the records of Harvard University.”
Agassiz resigned from the post of president in the fall of 1899, from honorary president in 1903, and died in 1907. But Agassiz’s fight, shared with Gilman, the committee, and countless students, instructors, and friends, to give women a Harvard education, would continue for another century. In 1999, after decades of slow change and continued negotiations, Radcliffe College was formally dissolved, the position of Radcliffe President disappeared, and the diplomas of all female students carried one, not two, presidential signatures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On December 2, 1942, James Bryant Conant—Harvard University President and the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee—received a phone call from prominent physicist Arthur Compton.
“The Italian navigator has landed in the New World,” said Compton—an improvised coded message to notify Conant of the first successful nuclear chain reaction, a crucial step in the development of the atomic bomb.
“How were the natives?” Conant responded without missing a beat.
“Very friendly,” Compton replied.
With this short, impromptu exchange, Conant became one of the first people in the world to learn of the military technology that would end World War II and change the course of human history.
President of Harvard from 1933 to 1953, Conant is remembered for his decades of service to both the University and the nation. Ever committed to meritocratic principles, Conant increased financial aid and promoted the expansion of standardized testing at Harvard, while simultaneously maintaining involvement in several government projects during and after the war. In this way, Conant’s legacy extends beyond Harvard to encompass the society in which he lived. More than a powerful university president, he was a quiet yet profound leader of Cold War America.
The first in his family to attend college, Conant’s socioeconomic background represented a significant departure from those of his immediate predecessors, Charles William Eliot and Abbott Lawrence Lowell, both of whom came from established Boston Brahmin families.
Born in Dorchester, Mass., in 1893, Conant graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 1914 with a degree in chemistry, earning his Ph.D. in 1917 and later becoming a professor.
When Conant was appointed University president in 1933, one of his top priorities was to “swing an axe against the root of privilege” through the expansion of financial aid, which he believed would allow for greater socioeconomic diversity in the student body. At Conant’s very first Harvard Corporation meeting in September 1933, he proposed a major fundraising effort, later known as the 300th Anniversary Fund, which supported the creation of national scholarships for talented students regardless of their financial backgrounds.
Conant was also a firm believer in the power of standardized testing to help college administrators identify and admit qualified students based on merit rather than social connections or class. He was a strong advocate for the widespread adoption of the Scholastic Aptitude Test and, later, for the creation of the Educational Testing Service, for which he served as the founding chairman.
Conant’s role in reshaping standardized testing was one of many endeavors that reflect his overarching commitment to issues of national importance. Over the course of several decades, Conant testified before U.S. Senate committees on topics ranging from federal aid to education, the creation of the National Science Foundation, and the development of the Lend-Lease Program—an important wartime initiative that allowed the U.S. to supply its allies with military resources during World War II, moving away from its previous policy of isolationism.
As the U.S. became increasingly drawn into World War II, Conant’s involvement in government projects intensified. In 1941, he was appointed to chair the National Defense Research Committee, which directly supported the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb, and was present at the bomb’s first testing in New Mexico in July 1945. He also worked as a special deputy to the head of the Office of Scientific Research and Development Vannevar Bush, who was also Vice President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a close personal friend.
Conant also supported the American war efforts in subtler ways. He conferred with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on military issues and traveled to England as an emissary for defense research. In July 1944, as the war was drawing to a close, Conant allowed the U.S. State Department to use Harvard’s Dumbarton Oaks Research Library in Washington, D.C. for a conference on postwar security. The conference resulted in the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals, which helped create the charter of the United Nations. Personally concerned with postwar nuclear safety, Conant traveled to Moscow shortly after the end of the conflict to participate in talks with Great Britain and the Soviet Union about nuclear weapons controls.
Concurrently with his wartime political projects, Conant led a significant review of the undergraduate curriculum at Harvard in the 1940s. With Provost Paul H. Buck, Conant developed the General Education Program to encourage study in a broad array of liberal arts, laying the foundation for the current General Education curriculum. In particular, he advocated the development of the history of science as an academic discipline. Shifting the emphasis of the standard curriculum away from the classics, Conant focused on instruction in the sciences and current affairs.
In 1945, he published a summary of the program entitled “General Education in a Free Society,” a text that later became colloquially known as the “Red Book.” The principles of Conant’s pedagogical philosophy extended beyond universities and impacted both high school and college curricula around the country.
During his 20-year tenure, Conant also oversaw important changes in the physical and pedagogical structure of the University, including the construction of Houghton and Lamont libraries and the creation of the Graduate School of Design, the Graduate School of Public Administration—later renamed the John F. Kennedy School of Government—and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism. The integration of female students at  Radcliffe College into Harvard College classrooms—initially a temporary wartime measure—also occurred under his presidency, as did the creation of University Professorships, special academic distinctions awarded to distinguished faculty members to support interdisciplinary research.
“The University salutes all who are leaving Harvard to serve the nation,” said Conant on a cold winter morning in a valedictory address to the Class of 1943, whose graduation ceremony had been hastened so that the young men could enter the military service earlier.
“[Every man] feels it in his bones that men ought to be free,” he said, reminding the students of the importance of defending liberty, the greater purpose behind their sacrifice.
Like the young graduates, Conant dedicated his life to serving both Harvard and the nation. His legacy of establishing an academic meritocracy at the university level and protecting American democracy at the national level reflects a man who valued liberty in all its forms and appreciated its worth down to his very bones.
arvard University, the oldest institution of higher learning in America, celebrates its  375th birthday today, and it will be feted with the fanfare appropriate for such a milestone.
At its birthday party this evening, Harvard will be serenaded by renowned cellist YoYo Ma ’76 and honored with an enormous 8-by-15 foot cake prepared by another notable alumna, celebrity chef Joanne Chang ’91.
After feasting on a specially prepared dinner (which will include dishes such as hasty pudding), undergraduates will parade into Tercentary Theatre to celebrate their university’s founding. There will be dancing, munching on hors d’oeuvres, and even an open bar under twinkling lights strung from tree to tree.
It all sounds very grand, but compared to Harvard’s 350th anniversary the affair is a low-key one. That anniversary was celebrated with a formal dinner, an appearance by the Prince of Wales, and a performance by the Boston Pops. President Reagan was invited by declined to attend.
Today, a shadow hangs over the celebration.
Following World War II, Harvard largely hitched its fortunes to the United States and rode to the top as the country ascended as a world power. In the post-war years, Harvard and the federal government grew closer as Congress appropriated increased funding for scientific research, helping to fuel the expansion of the University.
But now, as America’s star has begun to dim and other countries are diluting United States’ influence on the international stage, will Harvard’s fate be once again entwined with America’s?
THE COMING OF A SUPERPOWER
During World War II, the relationship between Harvard and Washington had grown so cozy that Economic Professor John Kenneth Galbraith later quipped that the war years were a time “when you could hold a faculty meeting every Friday on the Federal Express bound for Washington.”
Harvard had strong ties with American government since the nation’s founding—eight Harvard men signed the Declaration of Independence—but this bond took on new meaning during the World War II.
Harvard first received federal funding in the late 1800s as the United States government began to focus on promoting education (the Department of Education, then called the Office of Education, was founded in 1867). But federal funding for science research flooded into Harvard during World War II as the United States looked to academics and researchers to develop technology that would keep its military competitive with Axis powers.
University President James Bryant Conant, a chemist by profession, was instrumental in facilitating this interchange between Harvard and the government during his twenty years in office from 1933 to 1953.
During World War I, Conant had served in the Chemical Warfare Service and headed the research unit that created mustard gas. When war broke out in Europe for a second time, Conant, then president of Harvard, jumped at the opportunity to aid the United States’ efforts to update and advance its military technology. He chaired the National Defense Research Council, which oversaw the development of the atomic bomb, from 1939 to 1946. He was an adviser to the Manhattan Project, the secret effort led Robert Oppenheimer to build an atom bomb.
Conant’s work during World War II was part and parcel of Harvard’s expansion in the sciences, and his work helped lay the groundwork for post-war collaboration between American universities and the government.
But other parts of the University also profited from federal funding for science research, which freed up money for the social sciences and humanities departments. The G. I. Bill, passed in 1944, provided funding that enabled over two million veterans to attend college, most of who probably would not have otherwise. With financial support from the federal government, Harvard was a rapidly expanding place during the war years.
As World War II drew to a close, it became clear that America was indisputably the dominant Western power. World War II had ravaged Europe. European nations suffered heavy losses in casualties, finances, and damage to infrastructure. At this unique moment in history, America was a prospering nation while the economies of its former competitors were in shambles, and American universities rode the rising tide of U.S. power to educational preeminence.
“In the 1960s, Americans enjoyed an enormous advantage in terms of the amount available to them,” Professor Louis Menand, a scholar of the Cold War, said. “They used more electricity, consumed more calories, and had more cars than anyone else in the world.”
Today, Harvard receives over $600 million in funding from the federal government, and that number jumps to $1.2 billion if Harvard-affiliated hospitals are included. While the government’s commitment to Harvard may have not wavered much in recent years, the United States is no longer the superpower it once was. China and India have become economic powerhouses as the U.S. economy has been wracked with recession and downturns.
And amid economic headwinds and a growing desire for fiscal belt-tightening in Washington, that funding may now be in danger. Several political leaders—including President Obama—have made promises that funding for research will not land on the chopping block, but that is far from certain in the current political climate. Continued instability in the markets and the threat of another recession only heightens the possibility that Harvard will face a shortfall of funding in coming years.
More broadly, a general sense of American decline—and the rise of other countries—threatens the sense of American superiority that has buttressed Harvard’s standing. But professors say that Harvard should be able to maintain its international prestige even if American power is eclipsed on the international stage and its economy weakens.
“I don’t think the University’s standing is dependent on the perpetuation of American economic hegemony,” said James T. Kloppenberg, chair of the history department and a scholar of American history. “The persistence of Harvard’s excellence is dependent on whether we continue to attract the best and brightest, and not so much if America continues to be the economic juggernaut it has been.”
“As long as people think that they can find the best education anywhere here at Harvard, and as long as they’re willing to come to Cambridge that position of dominance should not be too threatened,” he added.
Others say that while the support of the American government and America’s position on the international stage are important for Harvard to retain its standing, they suggest that Harvard’s reputation will in large part be dependent on its “cultural capital.”
“The problem of maintaining status, something that Harvard and many leading U.S. institutions face, is huge,” said Michael Tworek, a graduate student in the history department who teaches a seminar called “The University and Society.” “Harvard’s position is dependent on a combination of two factors: political support and cultural capital. These are essential in terms of allowing Harvard to keep its preeminent place in the world.”
Tworek and Kloppenberg said that as long as Harvard’s alumni and faculty continue to be innovators and leaders, American decline would not necessarily extend to Cambridge.
“Universities are best judged by the products it produces,” Tworek said.
Or to put it in economic terms: “Higher education is an export commodity, and it’s very much in demand,” Menand said. “People all around the world want to come to Harvard, because most countries don’t have the liberal education that you can get here.”
LEGACY OF REFORM
Hic in silvestribus et incultis locis angli domo profugi anno post christum natum CIC IC C XXXVI post coloniam huc deductam vi sadientiam rati ante omnia colendam scholam publice condiderunt conditam christo et ecclesiae dicaverunt.
In the dark wood above the stage in Sanders Theatre are inscribed the following words:
“Here in wooded and uncultivated places Englishmen, fugitives from home, in the year after the birth of Christ 1636 (and) after the colony was founded here, the sixth, because they thought that wisdom was to be cultivated before all else, founded a school by public enactment and when founded dedicated (it) to Christ and his Church.”
Today, Harvard bears little resemblance to the place described in these Latin lines, and Harvard’s legacy of reform and change may also help the University remain resilient in if the United States’ decline continues.
As Conant pointed out in 1936, Harvard has undergone many transformations in its lifetime.
“Harvard was founded by dissenters,” he said. “Before two generations had passed there was a general dissent from the first dissent. Heresy has long been in the air.”
Among the most significant of these dissenters were Conant’s two predecessors, Charles William Eliot and Abbot Lawrence Lowell. Eliot, who served as president from 1869 to 1909, made great strides in bringing Harvard from the Protestant religious seminary founded in 1636 to the modern university it is today.
“The university must accommodate itself promptly to significant changes in the character of the people for whom it exists,” Eliot said during his presidency.
Inspired by German universities, Eliot revamped the College’s curriculum and academic structure, creating the elective system. He created academic departments and shifted focus from the classical learning model to one that emphasized more practical pursuits.
“Eliot asked if what the University was providing as training was preparing students for society’s needs, and this was a very important shift within Harvard,” Tworek said. “And he saw that Harvard was not fulfilling the larger needs of society.”
“We seek to train doers, achievers, men whose successful careers are much subservient to the public good. We are not interested here in producing languid observers of the world, mere spectators n the game of life, or fastidious critics of other men’s labors,” he said on another occasion.
Lowell, who held office from 1909 to 1933, furthered Eliot’s modernization of Harvard and created the concentration system, which remains in place today, though it has been adjusted since Lowell’s time.
Lowell also began to push for greater meritocracy, a priority also adopted by Conant. Under the latter, meritocratic reforms were put in place to open the University to students and faculty who were from what were then considered non-traditional backgrounds.
“The rise from its earlier status from bastion of the New England elite to a broader stage had everything to do with the opening up of the faculty and student body,” Kloppenberg said.
And these academics say that this spirit of reform will help Harvard remain on top.
“Harvard I think in many respects has recognized that an evolving curriculum is crucial,” Tworek said. “Curriculum allows students to be players in the global marketplace, the global sphere, and that, in turn, benefits the University’s reputation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hopes were high for Abbot Lawrence Lowell in 1909, as he stood poised to replace Charles W. Eliot, class of 1853, as president of Harvard. He was “the only real candidate,” wrote Jerome D. Greene, Secretary to the Harvard Corporation. Lowell’s ties to the University ran deep: He had graduated from the College in 1877, the Law School in 1880, and, since 1897, had served as a lecturer and then as a popular professor of Government.
In formulating his vision for Harvard’s future, Lowell signaled a need for both expansion and modification of his predecessor’s projects, and he instituted the system of concentrations and distribution requirements that has continued, in a modified form, into the present day. Lowell is also largely responsible for various additions to the physical face of Harvard, including Widener Library, completed in 1915, the Fogg Art Museum (renovated in 1927), and Memorial Church (dedicated in 1932).
But a fixation on Lowell’s tangible achievements belies the inconsistencies and controversies that plagued his career—and that for a long time were never officially denounced. The president cultivated a reputation as a progressive who sought to open Harvard’s resources to the local community—but he also tried to limit the enrollment of Jews and to restrict the experience of African-Americans students.
In one sense, Lowell was deeply tormented by what he saw as the stratified social experience of Harvard undergraduates. Wealthy New England prep school students lived in high style in private student residences along Mt. Auburn Street’s “Gold Coast,” while their less monied peers resided in the shabby dorms of Harvard Yard.
Lowell came to believe that a system of randomized freshman housing, followed by dispersion into upperclassmen houses, would be the best way to promote mingling among social classes. He saw in such an initiative the importance of having Harvard’s social makeup reflect the increasing diversity of the nation as a whole. However, Lowell’s philosophy of expansion and inclusion was undermined by his assumptions that Harvard had no place for social and racial minorities—indeed, by his assertion that these  groups posed a threat to the university’s ability to thrive.
In May 1920, Harvard undergraduate Cyril B. Wilcox, class of 1922, committed suicide—shortly after confiding in his brother George, class of 1914, about a romantic relationship in which he was involved with Harry Dreyfus, an older Boston resident. Soon after his death, George received two letters from Cyril’s classmates, addressed to his brother and referring to a scene of homosexual activity at Harvard.
George went immediately to Dean Chester N. Greenough, who spoke with Lowell about the case. The president created a five-person body dubbed the “Secret Court” to investigate the affair, and the court ultimately declared 14 men “guilty” of
homosexual activity. Lowell directed Greenough to ask those implicated to leave the Harvard campus and the city of Cambridge at once. Before they could release the verdict, however, another student—Harvard Dental School student Eugene R. Cummings—had committed suicide.
Harvard never officially publicized the actions of what came to be known as the “Secret Court of 1920” under Lowell. The information only came to light, and then-President Lawrence H. Summers released an apology, following a six-month investigation and scrutiny published by The Crimson in 2002.
In other instances, however, Lowell’s discriminatory policies were less carefully veiled. Lowell had instituted a new admissions test in 1909, one that he hoped would draw students from outside the familiar contours of New England boarding and prep schools, helping shape Harvard into a more truly national university. A side effect of such a policy, however, was the increase in the Jewish population at Harvard—from six percent in 1908 to 22 percent in 1922.
In response, Lowell proposed to the Board of Overseers the limiting of Jewish enrollment to 15 percent of the student population. “The anti-Semitic feeling among the students is increasing,” Lowell wrote in a letter to Harvard graduate A.A. Benesch in 1922, “and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews.”  The quota would, he claimed, help stem such prejudice.
The Board of Overseers unanimously overruled Lowell in 1923, but he managed to put his beliefs into action through other, subtler means. He proposed a new policy of admissions—adding letters of recommendation and an interview to assess “aptitude and character.” This policy, for Lowell, resolved what a quota was judged ill suited to do: by 1933, the percentage of Jews had shrunk to 10 percent of the student body.
Lowell employed similar logic in another controversial initiative: his attempt to ban African-American students from the freshman dorms. “We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man,” Lowell stated following student protests in 1922, “but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.”
In an era in which rapid social change was displacing the very foundation of previous ethical assumptions, Lowell was not exempt from the inconsistencies inherent in trying to formulate a coherent social paradigm. In many ways, he encapsulated the fundamental issues of the Progressive Era—an age in which social reforms meant to promote a democratic society existed side by side with nativist initiatives, which sought to deny to immigrants those same reforms. A growing emphasis on the ideal of democracy prompted earnest debate over who, exactly, was included in such an ideal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
W.E. B. Du Bois championed higher education. But though Du Bois was one of Harvard University’s most dedicated advocates and most esteemed graduates, Harvard never quite welcomed him into the fold.
“Du Bois famously remarked that he was ‘in Harvard, but not of it,” said Professor Henry Louis Gates, Director of the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research.  “While Harvard was his fantasy place to study, Du Bois could not even live in the dorms.”
Du Bois attended Harvard College in 1888, and earned his PhD in History in 1895—the first African American to earn a doctorate at Harvard.
“Du Bois’ example—performing brilliantly in the classroom—became metaphor for academic excellence in diversity,” said Professor Gates.
The accomplished DuBois was a prolific author and scholar, best known for “The Souls of Black Folk,” originally published in 1903. The book, originally a series of essays in “Atlantic Monthly,” was an autobiographically informed sociological argument for racial equality in American society. In a sentence, it demands that Southern blacks deserve to be treated with justice, a good education, and, in practical terms, the right to vote.
Perhaps the hallmark quote of “Souls” is: “The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line.” In those terms, the book continues to influence public discussion at Harvard and beyond.
“If Du Bois were alive,” he said, “he would see clearly that Harvard, just like America, has not yet reached the Promised Land of a post-racial society, and it will not for a very long time. Not until programs such as affirmative action and goals such as excellence and diversity in admissions have achieved their purpose—which is to diversify the educated classes by gender, by race, and religion and by sexual orientation.”
In 375 years, Harvard and the United States has witnessed a transition from the oppression of black people through slavery to the first black president, Barack Obama, himself a graduate of the Law School.  Obama represents the epitome of the “talented tenth” that Du Bois describes in his essay “The Negro Problem.”
According to Gates, Du Bois would praise President Obama for attempting to heal the ideological, economic, and religions divisions in our country. “And then,” he said, “I think he would tell him to turn back into your soul and remind us of who we are as Americans by sharing your fundamental principles with us over and over again in your splendid, eloquent voice.”
As for Du Bois’s influence on Harvard, Gates recalls University President Drew G. Faust’s inaugural address.
“She used this quote by Du Bois,” he said. “‘I insist that the object of all true education is not to make men carpenters, it is to make carpenters men.’  Du Bois’ legacy and message to those of us at Harvard today is best exemplified by that quote. These words are even more urgent today in an era where so many of our best students who would have otherwise become scholars instead become investment bankers and hedge fund managers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 20, 2003, the day the United States invaded Iraq, Harvard students took to the Yard with bullhorns and pickets. Channel 7 was there to cover what they thought was the inevitable Harvard anti-war protest. But the cameras instead captured the School’s annual Housing Day festivities. Unfortunately for Channel 7, the student activities did not embody the knee-jerk anti-war reaction that has been associated with Harvard in the past. In fact, Harvard’s relationship with war over the past three centuries has been far more complicated.
MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD
The American Revolution marked one of the student body’s first forays into the political discourse of war. It was during that period that a group of students established the “Speaking Club,” a peaceful but lively organization in which students could vent their frustrations at the British government and express their revolutionary ideals. The revolutionary fervor circulating on campus only resulted in one violent incident: a riot broke out when two loyalist students brought tea—a product of contention in the days of the Boston Tea Party—into the dining hall.
The Speaking Club’s legacy as a forum for political conversation endured long after the United States won independence. Publications in particular—The Crimson included—provided a voice for the oft-frustrated student body. From 1914 to 1917, The Crimson staunchly advocated isolationism in the face of the European conflict. When the United States finally chose to enter the war, the paper’s front page headline read “RAGNAROK,” an esoteric but biting reference to the apocalypse of Scandinavian mythology. In 1940, the then-isolationist Crimson published an editorial criticizing the Harvard World War I veterans who partook in a war that set the precedent for America’s involvement overseas.
The turbulence of the Vietnam years once more brought violence to the forefront of student protest. The 1969 student occupation of University Hall from April 9 to April 10 forced police to resort to the use of mace and billy clubs. 400 police officers flooded the yard, constituting the largest use of outside police force in school history, and more than 100 protestors were arrested.
FULFILLING A PATRIOTIC DUTY
Harvard as an institution, however, has remained remarkably active in the country’s military endeavors. During the Revolutionary War, the school could not avoid the conflict. Only a mere 17 miles from Concord, the opening shots of the Revolution reverberated intensely around the school. The state soon called upon the campus to serve the government, and College buildings were transformed into soldiers’ barracks while classes were relocated to Concord for 14 months. Normal school procedures, including Commencement, came to a halt for several years.
The Revolutionary War established a long-standing tradition of housing soldiers during times of military conflict. Once the United States entered World War I, dormitories and classrooms housed hundreds of naval cadets, while double-decker bunks for military trainees marked the World War II years.
In its efforts to remain a cutting-edge scientific and research institution, Harvard has also been at the forefront of developing military technologies. During World War I, the school’s chemistry department specialized in the production of poison gas and corresponding gas masks for soldiers. Three decades later, then-University President James B. Conant, a chemist by training and a member of the Class of 1914, was heavily invested in scientific military endeavors during World War II, particularly the development of the atomic bomb.
DISAGREEMENT AT HARVARD
The bumps in Harvard’s high-profile relationship with America’s wars have primarily originated in disagreements between the student body and the administration. Amidst the Revolution in 1780, students opposed to President Samuel Langdon’s revolutionary fervor publicly called for his resignation. During World War I, students challenged President Abbott L. Lowell’s interventionist ideals. They publicly decried his efforts to bring military recruiters to campus and claimed they were more concerned with winning the Harvard-Yale game than engaging in a foreign entanglement 3,000 miles away.
Similar disagreements arose during the onset of World War II. In the two years leading up to Pearl Harbor, the student body heavily criticized Conant’s advocacy for involvement in the war. A Christian Science Monitor poll in 1938 reported that 91 percent of Harvard’s student body was opposed to entering the war, while 62 percent opposed sending aid of any kind for fear that it would bring the war to American shores. The students picketed Conant’s office and publicly mocked him during the halftime show of the Harvard-Yale game.
Anti-administration rhetoric reached a high during the Vietnam War, mirroring anti-establishment movements across American college campuses. English Professor Louis Menand remembers observing the fervor surrounding the 1969 occupation of University Hall as a seventeen year-old living in Cambridge. “I think that the students in 1969 at Harvard, like the students at Columbia and Berkeley and other places where there were protests about the war, felt not listened to by the administration,” he says.
In 1967, as a sign of future protests to come, students forcibly held a military recruiter hostage in Mallinckrodt Laboratory for seven hours until he promised never to return to the campus. One year later, students staged a sit-in at Paine Hall until the school’s administration reached a decision about the potential elimination of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps from the school’s programs.
In the twentieth century, ROTC became one of the most significant points of contention on Harvard’s campus. In 1915, Harvard’s administration first met opposition when it introduced a military science course, according to Richard Norton Smith’s “The Harvard Century.” A year later, the University officially established ROTC on campus. Half a century later, with Vietnam raging, protesting students turned their sights to ROTC. They primarily wanted ROTC relegated to the status of an extracurricular activity, stripped of its academic legitimacy. More radical student organizations, such as the Harvard chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, wanted it removed entirely from the school.
On midnight of April 8, 1969, under the leadership of SDS co-chairman Michael Kazin ’70, students marched on President Nathan M. Pusey’s house to demand the end of ROTC on campus. Frustrations over Harvard’s military programs led directly to the ill-fated occupation of University Hall the following day. In the wake of the controversial police action to break up the sit-in, the school decided officially to abolish ROTC’s academic standings on campus.
ROTC was not formally reinstated until March of this year. Its return, to much fanfare, represented a tangible shift in Harvard’s relationship with the military. But the story is ongoing. Impassioned Crimson editorials, war memorials, and student protests all attest to Harvard’s long history of engaging with—opposing and supporting—a nation at war.

While the government’s commitment to Harvard may not have wavered much in recent years, the U.S. is no longer the superpower it once was. China and India have become economic powerhouses as the U.S. economy has been wracked with recession and downturns.
And amid economic headwinds and a growing desire for fiscal belt-tightening in Washington, that funding may now be in danger. Several political leaders—including President Obama—have made promises that funding for research will not land on the chopping block, but that is far from certain in the current political climate. Continued instability in the markets and the threat of another recession only heighten the possibility that Harvard will face a shortfall of funding in coming years.
More broadly, a general sense of American decline—and the rise of other countries—threatens the sense of American superiority that has buttressed Harvard’s standing. But professors say that Harvard should be able to maintain its international prestige even if American power is eclipsed on the international stage and its economy weakens.
“I don’t think the University’s standing is dependent on the perpetuation of American economic hegemony,” said James T. Kloppenberg, chair of the History Department and a scholar of American history. “The persistence of Harvard’s excellence is dependent on whether we continue to attract the best and brightest, and not so much if America continues to be the economic juggernaut it has been.”
“As long as people think that they can find the best education anywhere here at Harvard, and as long as they’re willing to come to Cambridge, that position of dominance should not be too threatened,” he added.
Others say that while the support of the American government and America’s position on the international stage are important for Harvard to retain its standing, Harvard’s reputation will in large part be dependent on its “cultural capital.”
“The problem of maintaining status, something that Harvard and many leading U.S. institutions face, is huge,” said Michael T. Tworek, a graduate student in the History Department who teaches a seminar called “The University and Society.” “Harvard’s position is dependent on a combination of two factors: political support and cultural capital. These are essential in terms of allowing Harvard to keep its preeminent place in the world.”
Tworek and Kloppenberg said that as long as Harvard’s alumni and faculty continue to be innovators and leaders, American decline would not necessarily extend to Cambridge.
“Universities are best judged by the products they produce,” Tworek said.
Or to put it in economic terms: “Higher education is an export commodity, and it’s very much in demand,” Menand said. “People all around the world want to come to Harvard, because most countries don’t have the liberal education that you can get here.”
LEGACY OF REFORM
Hic in silvestribus et incultis locis angli domo profugi anno post christum natum CIC IC C XXXVI post coloniam huc deductam vi sadientiam rati ante omnia colendam scholam publice condiderunt conditam christo et ecclesiae dicaverunt.
In the dark wood above the stage in Sanders Theatre are inscribed the following words:
“Here in wooded and uncultivated places Englishmen, fugitives from home, in the year after the birth of Christ 1636 (and) after the colony was founded here, the sixth, because they thought that wisdom was to be cultivated before all else, founded a school by public enactment and when founded dedicated (it) to Christ and his Church.”
Today, Harvard bears little resemblance to the place described in these Latin lines, and Harvard’s legacy of reform and change may also help the University remain resilient if the U.S. enters a period of decline.
As Conant pointed out in 1936, Harvard has undergone many transformations in its lifetime.
“Harvard was founded by dissenters,” he said. “Before two generations had passed there was a general dissent from the first dissent. Heresy has long been in the air.”
Among the most significant of these dissenters were Conant’s two predecessors, Charles William Eliot and Abbot Lawrence Lowell. Eliot, who served as president from 1869 to 1909, made great strides in bringing Harvard from the Protestant religious seminary founded in 1636 to the modern university it is today.
“The University must accommodate itself promptly to significant changes in the character of the people for whom it exists,” Eliot said during his presidency.
Inspired by German universities, Eliot revamped the College’s curriculum and academic structure, creating the elective system. He created academic departments and shifted focus from the classical learning model to one that emphasized more practical pursuits.
“Eliot asked if what the University was providing as training was preparing students for society’s needs, and this was a very important shift within Harvard,” Tworek said. “And he saw that Harvard was not fulfilling the larger needs of society.”
“We seek to train doers, achievers, men whose successful careers are much subservient to the public good. We are not interested here in producing languid observers of the world, mere spectators in the game of life, or fastidious critics of other men’s labors,” Eliot said on another occasion.
Lowell, who held office from 1909 to 1933, furthered Eliot’s modernization of Harvard and created the concentration system, which remains in place today, though it has been adjusted since Lowell’s time.
Lowell also began to push for greater meritocracy, a priority also adopted by Conant. Under the latter, meritocratic reforms were put in place to open the University to students and faculty who were from what were then considered non-traditional backgrounds.
“The rise from its earlier status from bastion of the New England elite to a broader stage had everything to do with the opening up of the faculty and student body,” Kloppenberg said.
And these academics say that this spirit of reform will help Harvard remain on top.
“Harvard I think in many respects has recognized that an evolving curriculum is crucial,” Tworek said. “Curriculum allows students to be players in the global marketplace, the global sphere, and that, in turn, benefits the University’s reputation.”Tworek said. “Curriculum allows students to be players in the global marketplace, the global sphere, and that, in turn, benefits the University’s reputation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In The Last Puritan, his epic novel that chronicles the life of the Boston Brahmin Oliver Alden, George Santayana, the Spanish-born philosopher who graduated from Harvard in 1886, alludes to the life of the outsider at the University.
Harvard outsiders, he writes, were “odd persons going about alone, or in little knots, looking intellectual, or looking dissipated […] likely to be Jews or radicals or to take drugs; to be musical; theatrical, or religious; sallow or bloated, or imperfectly washed; either too shabby or too well dressed.”
“The tribe of these undesirables,” Santayana concludes, “was always numerous at Harvard.” At the University’s 375th anniversary, the history of that “tribe of undesirables” includes the narratives of Native Americans, African-Americans, Jews, women, homosexuals, and many others historically excluded from University life. Below are a few of these narratives from last three and three-quarter centuries.
THE FOUNDING
When Joel Iacoomes, a Wampanoag American Indian from Martha’s Vineyard, arrived at Harvard’s Indian College, he and his classmate Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, class of 1665, had been attending preparatory school for five years in order to become fluent in Latin. An American Indian from the Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe, Iacoomes was the son of an interpreter for a Christian missionary and excelled academically.
Iacoomes and Cheeshahteaumuck were students at the Harvard Indian College, established by Harvard’s Charter of 1650. The charter calls for the “education of the English and Indian youth of this country, in knowledge and godliness.” The College stood on the present-day site of Matthews Hall and, in its history, only ever had five students: Iacoombe, Cheeshahteaumuck, John Wampus, Benjamin Larnell, and a student known only as Eleazer. Harvard professed its dedication to educating American Indians free of charge.
Cheeshahteaumuck was the only student ever to graduate from the Indian College. Iacoomes, Larnell, and Eleazer died before completing their degrees, and Wampus left to become a mariner. By the end of the 17th century, the Indian College had been torn down, its bricks to be used for the construction of other buildings.
Although Iacoomes died just weeks before graduation, Harvard declined to give him his degree.
MODERN TIMES
The first black student was not admitted to Harvard until 1847, when Beverly Garnett Williams was accepted but died before entering the college. After his death, Harvard waited nearly 20 years to admit Richard T. Greener, who graduated from the college in 1870. The next several decades saw more black students at Harvard and eventually at Radcliffe, including on athletic teams and in the graduate programs.
It wasn’t until the Presidency of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877, in the 1920s that the University took a step backwards.
Lowell, a Harvard alum and progressive in his stances on economic disparity, made it his mission to eradicate black students from Harvard Yard. He had not, he said, “thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together.”
“It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial,” Lowell said.
Feelings of racial segregation in housing persisted until the implementation of the randomized housing lottery in the 1990s.
THE SECRET COURT
In 2002, an investigative effort by The Crimson unearthed a new part of Lowell’s legacy, a “Secret Court” which Lowell convened to try, shame, and expel gay students from the University.
Eugene R. Cummings, a dental school student known in writings of the underground gay scene as “Pope,” was one of the students brought before the Court after the suicide of Cyril E. Wilcox, a student at the college who confessed his homosexuality to his brother before committing suicide.  Before the Court, Cummings maintained “absolute denial of any h.s. [homosexual] relations.” The testimony of other students interrogated by this ad-hoc group of judges implicated him in the fledgling gay scene.
Before finding out that he, along with nine other Harvard men, was found “guilty” and was expected to leave Harvard and Cambridge at once, Cummings committed suicide at Harvard’s Stillman Infirmary. He died three weeks before his expected graduation.
Today, Lowell house, named after the instigator of the “Secret Court” to purge homosexuals from Harvard, is the only upperclass house governed by gay housemasters, and the University added sexual orientation to its non-discrimination policy in 1985 and gender identity in 2006.
Although the University offers support for many medical transition options for transgender students, many members of the LGBTQ community were disappointed at Harvard’s decision to welcome ROTC back to campus last year despite the program’s continued ban on transgender students.
PURGE OF JEWISH STUDENTS
Lowell’s intolerance of Jewish students went hand–in–hand with his anti-gay and anti-black policies. After an admissions policy he championed led to an almost four-fold increase in the number of Jewish students at Harvard, Lowell attempted to institute a quota system, hoping to cap the number of Jews at not over 15 percent.
The quota system was needed, Lowell maintained, because anti-Semitic sentiment on campus “grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews.”
The overt anti-Semitism of Lowell’s quota system was voted down by the board of overseers, but his institution of more subjective aspects of the admissions process—letters of recommendation and interviews—allowed him to weed out Jewish students anyway. The percentage of Jewish freshmen at Harvard dropped drastically, from a high of 27.6 percent in 1925 to below 15 percent in 1933.
WOMEN AND RADCLIFFE
Despite the fact that coeducational colleges had existed in the country for over 50 years by 1879, that was the year that Radcliffe College, Harvard’s sister school, opened its doors to women for the first time. Although students often demonstrated considerable academic prowess, Harvard’s president at the time, Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, still questioned “whether the women have the originality and pioneering spirit which will fit them to be leaders.”
Although located just off Harvard Yard, Radcliffe women were not permitted to attend Harvard classes until 1943, when World War II accelerated integration. Beginning in 1963, Radcliffe diplomas were signed by the Presidents of both Harvard and Radcliffe, and, in 1972, the Yard dormitories were opened to women. It wasn’t until 1999, however, the female undergraduates were fully integrated officially into the Harvard community and began receiving Harvard diplomas instead of joint “Harvard-Radcliffe” certificates.
Complete integration on paper failed to end everyday issues, however. In 2005, then-President Lawrence H. Summers came under fire for making comments about women in the sciences that many believed to be sexist. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted “no confidence” in him shortly thereafter. As recently as last year, gender disparities on the Undergraduate Council caused concern about the role of women in leadership positions on campus.
PRESENT DAY
Today, Harvard is tackling one of the last institutionalized barriers to equal access–socioeconomic status.
The College implemented a need-blind admissions policy over two decades ago, allowing them to admit qualified applicants without regard to their family’s financial status. Recently, the College has strengthened efforts to help low-income students attend attend Harvard.
Starting in 2006, the University announced that families earning less than $60,000 annually would not be required to contribute towards their child’s education at the University. Last year, that number was raised to $65,000.
The need to make Harvard more socioeconomically diverse was also one of the reasons cited in Harvard’s suspension of its Early Decision program in 2006, although the program returned as Early Action for the class of 2016.
Many middle class families who do not qualify for as much aid, however, still face a considerable burden in sending their children to Harvard.
FULL CIRCLE?
At Commencement 2011, Tiffany J. Smalley ’11 became the first Wampanoag American Indian to graduate Harvard College since Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck in 1665. At the Commencement ceremony, she received Joel Iacoomes’ posthumous baccalaureate degree, a recognition of his academic achievements at the College.
“With the presentation of this degree, we also recognize some of the commitments that were fundamental to the founding of Harvard: a commitment to a diversity of students, a commitment to the communities in which the College was founded, and a commitment to the power of education to transform lives,” President Faust said at the ceremony.
Although the University—at this and other moments—has maintained its “commitment to a diversity of students,” some—such as an Extension School student currently campaigning to grant victims of President Lowell’s Secret Court posthumous degrees—are convinced there is more to be done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s an April night in 1969. Richard Nixon was elected president this past November, replacing Lyndon B. Johnson. Later this month, after 14 years of war, the number of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam will peak at 543,400 men. In December of this year, a draft lottery—which will determine the order of conscription through a random drawing of birth dates from a jar at the Selective Service Headquarters—will be held for the first time since 1942.
In the night, 300 students gather in front of the Loeb House, home of then-University President Nathan M. Pusey ’28, and look on as Michael Kazin ’70 affixes a list of demands to the door. At the top of the list is the expulsion of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps—a program that to anti-Vietnam students represents the administration’s complicity with the war effort—from Harvard’s campus.
Tomorrow at noon, students, with Kazin among them, will break in and occupy University Hall, expelling administrators and nonviolently holding the building until 3 a.m. The Boston Globe will estimate that, at one point, as many as 500 students are inside the building.
“It was more than an adolescent rebellion,” Kazin would later reflect. “We did not aim simply to desecrate the temple. We were fighting to stop a war.”
In the early hours of April 10, 400 city and state police officers, armed with billy clubs and Mace, will break in and arrest about 100 demonstrators. Though most will face penalties no more severe than a $20 fine, the occupation—and the administration’s decision to engage the police—will have more lasting consequences for the student body, including the expulsion of several undergraduates, a massive boycott of classes, and a ten thousand-strong rally lasting several days at the Harvard Stadium. The protesters will achieve their goal of ending the University’s support for ROTC shortly thereafter.
For Kazin, who will go on to become a history professor, writer, and prominent leftist political thinker, it’s not a bad way to make history.
Kazin was a junior at the time and one of three co-chairs of Harvard’s chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, which concerned itself with 1960s-era hot topics throughout the decade—everything from sexual mores to the plight of the underprivileged to nuclear disarmament. Kazin, however, was most concerned with the draft and with ROTC, which, prior to its expulsion from campus, offered course credit to participants.
This was Harvard, though, not Berkeley, and so what had exploded into the Free Speech Movement in 1964 in California took on a slightly different temperament. The plight of the working people was never the primary concern; instead, military issues, especially with the draft looming over graduating students, were at the forefront of student radicalism. Many Harvard students, Kazin included, were also cautious in light of events that transpired in the earlier part of the decade.
In 1968, for example, Harvard Divinity School students had begun to shelter Paul Olimpieri, a Marine resisting the draft, in Andover Chapel, claiming that he was serving an “authority higher than any political government or military organization.”
In September of that year, students proposed setting up another sanctuary for resisters and deserters in Claverly Hall—a move that was vetoed by Kazin and the rest of the SDS.
“In the end we would be dealing with punishment and the free speech issue instead of with the real issues of resistance,” Kazin said at the time.
“The Divinity School’s appeal to higher conscience is a bit too individually oriented,” he clarified. “The war and American foreign policy are unjust, and everyone should be resisting.”
In this idea of general resistance—what Kazin had earlier called “mass protest”—lay the seeds of his later career.
His interest in the welfare and intentions of the “masses” went beyond ending the war in Vietnam. Upon his election as co-chair of SDS in February of 1969, Kazin voiced his intent to not only abolish ROTC, but also to ally with working people in Cambridge to curb rising property rent. While Harvard undergraduates had attempted to unite with the working class earlier in the decade, they had met with mixed success. In one better-known incident, students attempted to organize meat packers at the Haymarket, only to be jeered off the premises.
But Kazin persisted in addressing the needs of the larger community during his time at SDS, demanding among the list of student demands that April that the University not tear down residential housing to make space for a new medical complex.
Kazin continued on from Harvard to join the Venceremos Brigade, a band of several hundred students who traveled to Cuba in 1970 to work with farmers harvesting sugar cane to help them meet Fidel Castro’s ambitious goal of reaping ten million tons that year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1938, the Cambridge City Council voted to secede from Harvard. The relationship had been souring for years as Harvard continued to expand into the city, buying Houses and other properties and depriving Cambridge of once fruitful sources of tax revenue.
Neighborly tension turned into outright vitriol, though, when the dean of Harvard Law School pushed to reform the Council, calling for a reduction of its size and a democratization of the election process.
Ultimately, the dean’s initiative failed (although a similar measure would pass a few years later) and the Massachusetts State Legislature did not move to sever Harvard from Cambridge.
This moment—which saw students and Cantabrigians literally standing along Mass Ave. defending their turf, and which featured allegations of Harvard Lampoon violence against City Council members—may represent a ferocious outlier in the sometimes tenuous relationship. But over the past 375 years, this marriage by circumstance has seen its ups and downs: in the beginning the pair was inseparable, eventually their feelings grew chilled, and in modern times, if they fight, more often than not, it stays behind closed doors.
PURITAN BEGINNINGS
Newly graduated from Emmanuel College in Cambridge, England, Reverend Thomas Shepherd found himself filled with a desire to promote “the fruitation of God’s ordinances” in the recently established New England. The “firm but gentle leader” found his way to Newtowne—a small, fortified settlement inland, near the Charles River, and today the heart of Harvard Square. Upon arriving, the inhabitants were drawn to his “vigilance” and soon ordained him minister of the already-established First Church of Cambridge, according to historian Samuel A. Eliot, Class of 1817.
In a nearby town, Salem, there was talk of erecting a college to maintain the colony’s Puritan beliefs. Shepherd’s popularity among the first Cantabrigians, however, drew interest to Newtowne so that he could oversee the school and maintain its theological purity. On Oct. 28, 1636 ,the court granted 400 pounds toward establishing a school in Newtowne, which would be renamed Cambridge the following year.
“The founding of Harvard College by the little colony was one of the most heroic, devout and fruitful events of American history,” Eliot wrote in his “History of Cambridge, Massachusetts 1630-1913.”
For a time, college, city, and church life were inextricably intertwined, according to Stephen P. Shoemaker, an expert on the history of the College. The heart of Cambridge was First Church. Those overseeing Harvard—Henry Dunster, Charles Chauncy, and Urian Oaks—were also ministers at First Church. Shoemaker characterized the dynamics between the church and Harvard as “almost incestuous.”
But almost 200 years after the College was founded, the relationship between the “little colony” and what would become one of the most esteemed universities in the world would irreversibly change: in 1805, Harvard appointed its first Unitarian professor after a heated debate.
In 1814, the University shifted its theology from First Church’s Trinitarian beliefs to Unitarian. Then, Harvard funded the establishment of the First Parish Cambridge Church.
“After that, virtually all faculty appointments went to Unitarians until the end of the 19th century,” Shoemaker wrote in an email.
Before the shift, Harvard and the broader Cambridge community shared a common religion, but “after the split the relationship was fundamentally changed forever,” Shoemaker says, giving birth to the legendary and grizzled disputes between Harvard and Cambridge.
WAR OF THE WORDS
The face of Cambridge changed
dramatically throughout the decades, and Harvard along with it. New political figures took office and demographics shifted as immigrants—particularly Irish families fleeing the potato blight—began to fill the city. And in the 1800s, theological priorities changed to industrial ones for both the city and the School.
But while a tax exempt Harvard looked to expand, Cambridge needed to cater to residential neighborhoods and communities.
Tensions came to a head in 1938, when an insular group of 13 city councilors was governing Cambridge.
It was then that Law School Dean James M. Landis pushed for Plan E—the proposal to reform the City Council.
Plan E charged that the number of councilors be cut to nine. The proposal was, in part, designed to decrease the councilors’ power and introduce a system of proportional representation—in which residents of Cambridge could vote for more than one candidate—creating a more open election process, the Crimson reported at the time.
In response, Cambridge undertook a war of words against Harvard and passed a proposal that would make Harvard a separate municipality from the city.
“Harvard hopes to use the City of Cambridge as a guinea pig for its laboratory experiments” until it is controlled by the University’s “disciples of Karl Marx,” Councilor John J. Toomey said at the time.
Members of a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine joined the fracas, carrying their club banner down Mass. Ave. in their own march for independence.
When city councilors tried to prevent the protest, members of the Lampoon allegedly struck them. No charges were filed.
Any hopes of peace would be found in the ballots. In November, councilors kept their power and residents voted against the Law School’s Plan E. But a few years later Cantabrigians voted to incorporate the proportional representation system after all.
In 1942 Cambridge Mayor John Corcoran ’18 instituted an annual series of dinners with Harvard and Cambridge City Council members. University President James B. Conant, Class of 1914, and the Harvard Corporation supported and hosted the gatherings. The dinners were said to be a symbol of the mutual interests shared by the University and City.
In an interview with The Crimson, City Manager John B. Atkinson said in 1950, “It is the small things that have helped cement relations between the town and the College.”
ALLSTON, THE NEW CAMBRIDGE?
The dinners continued throughout the 1980s. But by then, Harvard was in the middle of buying land in another community across the river, changing dynamics with Allston, subduing relations with Cambrdige.
“Land use, zoning, and building, the University’s desire to expand into neighborhoods has always caused complicated negotiations,” said Henrietta Davis, vice mayor of the Cambridge City Council. “Harvard’s focus on building now is on the Allston-Brighton area,” she said.
The University and Allston—Harvard’s newfound, though often scorned lover—have a relationship all of their own. It started in the 1990s when it was revealed that Harvard was surreptitiously purchasing property in Allston under a subsidiary of a different name. In Dec. 2009, reversing course in the face of the financial crisis, the University indefinitely halted construction on the Allston Science Complex, bolstering tensions between residents and the University.
As Harvard moves forward to implement the recently-approved Harvard Allston Work Team recommendations—an outline of the University’s plans for development in Allston—and as it sets its priorities for the upcoming capital campaign, it remains to be seen how Harvard treats its two romantic partners.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The late Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Moral Peter J. Gomes was an anomaly.
“An African-American from Plymouth, a Baptist in Memorial Church, a Republican in Cambridge, out-of-the-closet and out-of-the-box,”  University President Drew G. Faust said during a eulogy for the late minister this April.
Gomes’ distinctiveness may make him the odd man out when grouped with his eight predecessors in the role of minister at Harvard. For many reasons, his appointment to the position 35 years ago certainly raised eyebrows.
But Gomes’ selection during the turbulent 1960s and 70s was an early indicator of the evolution that the University would undergo during Gomes’ long tenure. In his 35 years at the helm of the church, Gomes came to embody and define the Harvard of today—an eccentric, eclectic mixture of increasingly diverse individuals at the forefront of progress and learning.
Growing up in Plymouth, he was surrounded by history. As a child he would walk through the town’s local cemetery, recalling from memory the names of America’s oldest settlers on the headstones. In his later years, his time in Plymouth was often spent at the Old Colony Club, one of the oldest all-male social clubs in America, and the Pilgrim Society, where he once served as president.
“As an African American growing up in Plymouth he was of course a minority,” Harvard Divinity School Professor Emeritus Harvey G. Cox Jr. said. “It’s rather indicative of how Peter was able to absorb, in his own way, traditions that were not biologically his own and make them his own. His whole life he was so steeped in the history of his hometown.”
Gomes adapted to his position at Harvard in much the same way. When he entered Harvard Divinity School in 1965, the United States and the world of religion were seemingly influx. Protests against the Vietnam War began to coalesce around the country, the Civil Rights movement seemed to be gaining ground, and the influence of religion appeared to be on the decline.
“In the 1970s, when Gomes took over, it was the low point of religious life in the United States and certainly on college campuses,” said Jonathan C. Page ’02, a former Epps Fellow at Memorial Church.
While as an African American he may have been a remarkable choice to lead the church at Harvard, a University where the faculty was still dominated by white men, Gomes’ commitment to tradition and to Harvard made him a logical, if unusual, selection. His course “The History of Harvard and Its Presidents” remained popular with students at the College for years.  He took pains to write a history of the Hollis professorship at Harvard Divinity School. When Cox wanted to graze a cow in Harvard Yard—a tradition that had been practiced by past holders of his endowed professorship—Gomes jumped on the opportunity to bring tradition back to life.
But, perhaps most significantly, Gomes was able to adapt traditions—giving them his own flair and allowing them to survive in a new era.
“I’ve given my life to Harvard, and I have a wonderful sense of the great continuity,” he said, reflecting on his career in an interview with The New Yorker. “I can see the Puritans sailing in, I can see Henry Dunster’s first Commencement, and the incredible thing is that I can see me in it!”
Viewing his career in retrospect, Gomes can perhaps be seen in the center of Harvard’s religious tradition. The ability to command a strong following with his sermons—solidly grounded in the Bible, but offering a different, more progressive interpretation—was a feat in itself that reflected his ability to merge the traditional with the contemporary.
“Many of us—when asked our denomination—continue to answer as Skip Gates once did: ‘We are Gomesians, sir,’” Kennedy School Professor and longtime member of the church’s congregation David R. Gergen said of Gomes’ traditional yet progressive Christianity.
This blend, along with his rhetorical abilities, maintained attendance at the church while the number of churchgoers declined at Protestant university churches across the country. And while Gomes’ role at Harvard extended beyond his preaching duties at Memorial Church, religion informed those functions and his everyday life.
“It was oftentimes hard to see Peter’s faith come through in his public persona at Harvard ... I was very struck that at the core of it all was this very strong Christian faith,” Page said. “The more you got to know him, the more you got to see that deep faith.”
Gomes’ open door created an abundance of stories featuring Gomes helping Harvard students through tough times. But his efforts in that regard were grounded in his faith as well.
“It is not what would [Jesus] do, but what would he want from me?” said Gomes, rephrasing the bumper sticker slogan on Charlie Rose  in 2007. Part of Jesus’ expectations, Gomes said, was loving others freely, something he strove to do at Harvard.
“Peter loved freely and was loved in return,” Faust said.
But by virtue of his unique character and abilities, his role as a spiritual beacon extended far beyond Harvard. As Memorial Church Associate Minister and longtime friend Dorothy A. Austin said, Gomes “brought religion into politics in ways that illumined our thought. At important moments, he stood up for things that mattered—for freedom, for liberty, and for equality.”
In the last decade of his life, Gomes spoke out against the impending war in Iraq and attracted attention when he left the Republican Party to vote for Deval L. Patrick ’78. But he took his most prominent political stance in 1991, when he came out as gay in response to homophobic remarks in a conservative Harvard magazine. His crusade against homophobia would lead him to take the spotlight on the national stage, speaking in front of the Massachusetts State House in support of same-sex marriage.
But while expressing progressive views, he never strayed from tradition and his Christianity. All of his identities—as a New Englander, an African-American, and a homosexual—he said, “are subordinate to my principal identity as a preacher and a child of Jesus Christ. I spoke, not as outraged homosexual, but as an outraged Christian.”
As a result, Gomes became a sort of de facto moral compass at Harvard, ready to weigh in on the issues of the day. At the same time, he recognized that his position at Harvard was unique.
“Harvard is my city of God. We are different from the rest of the world, and we ought to be,” he told The New Yorker in 1996.
Today, it is impossible to imagine Gomes as the church’s minister a century ago. Harvard of 1911 was nearly devoid of African Americans and would soon see the formation of a “Secret Court” that sought to expel homosexuals. But at the same, Gomes would have fit the role of minister perfectly—he was a devout Christian and a son of long-established Plymouth with a profound respect for Harvard and what it represents.
Gomes unique embodiment of the seemingly opposed value Harvard places on tradition and the importance of progress is perhaps best expressed by professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr.: “No one epitomizes all that is good about Harvard more than Peter J. Gomes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1636, a vote by the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony established Harvard College, the oldest institution of higher learning in what would become the United States. Two years later, upon the donation of John Harvard’s entire personal library and portions of his estate, this fledgling college became known as Harvard, and, ever since, has shaped the nation that grew up around its gates as much as the minds of the students it has educated. At Harvard’s 375th anniversary, this—among all the others in this University’s vast history—is the theme we celebrate the most: Harvard’s ability to inspire for the better both American society in general and its individual graduates.
Although it is true that Harvard has in many ways reflected certain trends in the history of the United States at different historical moments, it has also often shaped those trends, for better or for worse. True, first established to provide the British colonies with a ministry of learning, Harvard College was then emblematic of the Puritan values that governed the culture in which it was born. Also, in terms of demographics, it was of course composed of the scions of the American elite for the first few hundred years of its existence, and there is no denying that Harvard’s general conservatism in terms of curriculum and methodology was also in line with that group. But there are also many profound ways in which Harvard influenced the society that grew up alongside it. Here are a few.
In intellectual terms, Harvard is largely responsible for the genesis of pragmatism, one of the most significant movements in the intellectual history of the United States. As Professor Louis Menand points out in “The Metaphysical Club,” the pragmatists were thinkers who, in the context of a divided nation emerging from the Civil War, rejected the notion of absolutes and the certainty with which the previous generation had clung to their assumptions. Heavily influenced by Darwin’s “Origin of Species,” these thinkers—whose ranks included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Charles Sanders Peirce, and William James—more or less applied Darwinian principles to philosophy: in linking practice and theory, they were essentially articulating a new mode of thought for American society, just emerging from a cataclysmic event and in need of a focus, voice, and purpose. Starting in the 1870s, the pragmatists provided those things to their country, and they did so—in large part—from the hallowed halls of Harvard.
Additionally, Harvard has shaped the typical course of higher education in the United States. In the nineteenth century, Harvard—under the leadership of A. Lawrence Lowell, a member of the Class of 1877 and known as much for his bigotry as for his commitment to curricular reform—pioneered a system in which students chose a particular discipline in which to focus the bulk of their studies. While still well grounded in the various departments of academia, students became specialized, a trend that still continues to this day. Additionally, during the presidency of James Bryant Conant, a member of the Class of 1914, Harvard—somewhat radically—pushed for meritocracy in order to confront the rapidly growing American aristocracy and to share its resources with as many qualified, talented students as possible. With one of the most generous financial aid programs in the nation today, Harvard remains true to its commitment to the meritocratic ideal, and we could not be prouder that many universities here and abroad have emulated that same ideal.
Of course, Harvard can also inspire and influence within the respective sphere of the individual. It seems safe to say that many graduates who pass through the gates of this University experience a moment of discovery that, for better or for worse, inspires each to action of some kind. Such inspiration can come in the classroom or on the playing field, among faculty members or with roommates. In any case, it is a unique ability of this University to reach as many individuals as it does, and, at this moment in Harvard’s history, we can only express our gratitude for the privilege of attending. Looking forward to the next 375 years, we are certain that Harvard will be decidedly different in every respect save for this, its ability to transform its students and the society in which it exists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John S. Park, a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and Senior Program Officer at the U.S. Institute of Peace, discussed China’s economic engagement with North Korea last night at a lecture in CGIS-South.
Stabilizing North Korea is a fundamental goal for the Chinese as they seek continued economic growth, according to Park.
By supporting the North Korean regime—and promoting development within the nation—China gains greater access to resources. Thus, China—which still considers itself a developing nation, according to Park—has grown increasingly close with North Korea over the past decade in the pursuit of greater economic and political power.
But the nation’s relationship with North Korea also poses what Park called a “perennial headache” for China.
China established diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, a move which North Korea proclaimed “The Great Betrayal.”
The following decade, Park noted, saw hostility between the nations. At the same time, Park explained, North Korea’s loss of a key trading partner led it to divert greater resources toward nuclear development.
Tension between the nations eased when China expressed willingness to develop resource exchanges with North Korea, Park said.
In discussing the implications of this relationship for the United States, Park noted that China enjoys peaceable relations with North Korea, even while the U.S. imposes sanctions on the nation for its nuclear program.
While the Chinese do not support North Korean provocation of the South, they instead take what Park called a “Please Remain Calm” attitude toward all parties.
The event was co-sponsored by the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies China and the Korea Institute.
The Fairbank Center focuses on research and study concerning East Asia, in particular China, including Taiwan.

Two Harvard University Police officers will soon be laid off by the University, according to the national president of an umbrella police union organization.
Harvard University was not properly paying its police officers, David Holway, the head of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, alleged Thursday. The issue, which arose during the arbitration, was valued at approximately $500,000, Holway said.
The Harvard University Police Association, the independent union representing Harvard University Police, declined to comment on Wednesday and did not immediately return The Crimson’s request for comment on Thursday.
In a statement released to The Crimson via email, Harvard Police declined to confirm that they would be making layoffs.
“HUPD leaders and the local representatives of our officers are engaged in a substantive conversation about several issues, but both sides have agreed to refrain from discussing the issues publicly for now,” said Chief of Harvard University Police Francis D. “Bud” Riley, according to the statement.
Holway, the International Brotherhood of Police Officer president, said that laying off the two officers would jeopardize the safety of the University community.
“To put the life and safety of the Harvard community at risk when they’re sitting at $34 billion [in endowment value]—that’s wrong,” Holway said.
But in his statement, Riley said that the result of the discussions will not have an impact on campus security.
According to the Harvard University Police Association website, the union represents approximately 62 Harvard University Police Department employees.
The current contract between the union and Harvard expires in July 2012.
“We don’t know why it is that out of the clear blue sky, the University is laying off two police [officers],” Holway said.
Riley said that Holway has not played a role in the discussions taking place between the Harvard University Police Association and the Harvard University Police Department.
“We are optimistic that the conversations will be productive,” Riley said.

The Arthur M. Sackler Museum kept its doors open after hours Thursday night for a special event entitled “Science and Superstition Night at the Sackler,” hosted by the Harvard Art Museums’ Undergraduate Connection.
Students grazed on a wide spread of snacks, including various desserts decorated in black and orange in honor of Halloween. HAMUC members donned black clothing and pairs of cat ears to get in the spirit of the holiday.
Both museum curators and Harvard undergraduates conducted tours of the galleries throughout the evening. Additionally, students were able to explore the museum’s entire collection at their leisure. The event was part of an effort to attract students to the museum, and it drew about 25 students to the museum.
Carl A. Weyerhaeuser Curator of Prints Susan M. Dackerman gave a gallery tour of the special exhibit “Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge in Early Modern Europe” on display at the Sackler for the entirety of the fall semester.
“This exhibit looks at the role that artists played in the scientific investigation in the 16th century,” said Dackerman, who encouraged students to come see the exhibit. “It’s an opportunity to see where the history of art crosses with other disciplines.”
Attendees made prints of their own and completed a scavenger hunt in the exhibit. Later in the evening, the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones performed for the attendees.
HAMUC President Shannon M. Morrow ’12 said she hopes free events such as this one will help accomplish her organization’s goal of drawing students to Harvard’s art museums. Morrow said that she has expanded the activities of HAMUC beyond planning events at the art museums and that her organization now sends out an internship listing and arranges events with curators and conservationists at Harvard for students interested in those careers.
HAMUC member Marina Molarsky-Beck ’15, a potential history of art and architecture concentrator, said that she felt more could be done to bring students to Harvard’s museums.
“People I talked to were interested in the event but didn’t even know where the Sackler was,” she said.
HAMUC will host two to three similar events for students throughout the year.
Krystle M. Leung ’15 said that though she plans to concentrate in the sciences she is very interested in art. She said she wished more students knew about Harvard’s extensive art collection, which is the largest university collection in the country.
“Art is a different way of explaining humanity,” Leung said.

Last Saturday, Laura E. Donohue ’85 opened the doors to the new home of Bob Slate at 30 Brattle St. Even though the store was not fully stocked and they could not accept credit cards, word had spread that a new Bob Slate would be opening, and it was quickly flooded with old customers.
“I decided to let people walk in and believe Bob Slate was real,” Donohue said.
That day, the store grew so busy that Donohue called in Mallory Slate, the former owner, to help run the cash register. At the new location, many of the faces remain the same as Donohue has hired several former store employees.
Donohue is herself no stranger to the Square’s most venerable stationery store, having purchased her school supplies there as a student in Cambridge. Now, Donohue faces the challenge of reinvigorating the 80-year-old store beloved by Cantabridgians.
CUSTOMER TO OWNER
When Donohue moved into Thayer and began her first year at the College, she needed school supplies and was soon told of the “great store” Bob Slate by upperclassmen. There she found traditional folders, notebooks emblazoned with the Bob Slate logo, and unique items from green pens to golden binder clips.
“It was like a treasure hunt every time I was there,” Donohue said.
That store, on 1288 Mass. Ave., was her go-to place for school supplies during her four years at Harvard and later at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Twenty years later, Donohue returned to the store to cheer herself up by buying a nice pen only to find a sign announcing the closing of all three Bob Slate locations.
“We’re going to lose another one,” Donohue thought until she looked closer at the sign and saw that the owners—brothers Mallory and Justin Slate—had been trying to sell the business for two years.
“So I bought the pen and then I asked an employee, Jim Barbaro, who had helped me pick out supplies when I was a student at business school, ‘Who do I talk to about buying the business?’”
Since purchasing the store last spring, Donohue has worked to open the business but has faced a series of obstacles. At first, she and the Slates believed they could keep the storefront, but it had already been purchased.
“I said I’m not done yet. You don’t know who you’re dealing with,” she said.
Donohue walked the streets of Harvard Square and made calls to the empty storefronts. The first call went to Richard Getz, who owns the property at 30 Brattle St. Getz immediately got onboard with the project, telling Donohue over the phone, “Bob Slate? No problem.”
Before buying the store, Donohue worked for Harvard Business Publishing, a job she had grown tired of. She also owns a four-family home behind Mather House that she has rented out for 14 years. After leaving her job, Donohue thought about buying another property to lease—until she walked into Bob Slate. Donohue emptied her retirement fund to purchase the store.
“At a big corporation, you don’t get to see the individuals, but here you’re helping somebody have a nice day. I want to be happy and enjoy what I do. And if I can make a salary and employ nice people too, that’s great,” Donohue said.
THE MODERN STATIONERY STORE
The Slates have had to reinvent the store several times since its founding in the 1930s by adapting to the changing technology, including popularization of the telephone and the invention of the fax machine. Now, the company faces competition from internet sales and needs to reinvent itself again. But in their mid-70s, the Slate brothers no longer had the energy to do it.
“Laura [Donohue] is a magnificent human being full of enthusiasm and vigor needed to take Bob Slate into the 21st century,” Mallory said.
Donohue is looking to modernize the store by beginning to sell technology accessories and personalized invitations and stationery. She also has plans to periodically introduce new items into the inventory, which she hopes will add variety to the store’s offerings. Donohue also said that she will carry out market research to determine how to increase the number of younger customers.
“I’d love to come to a Harvard dorm room and see what they have on their desk. How do they organize their work? What do they bring to class?” Donohue said.
Donohue is embracing new technology by adding a computer system that will integrate the store’s financial system and the register, so she can keep track of the sales. Donohue also plans on creating a web store.
Along with adding new items, Donohue will continue selling Bob Slate’s traditional products, including theses binders, one item that she fondly remembers having to purchase at Bob Slate when she was an undergraduate.
“Mallory and Justin gave me their store with their fathers’ name. I want to be true to Bob Slate,” Donohue said.
Donohue is planning a grand opening before the holiday season when the store will be fully stocked.

A panel of Air Force representatives discussed qualities essential to being a military leader—including adaptability and decisiveness—while stressing that the military must address economic difficulties in the years to come.
“A real difference about the way leadership works in the military is leading rather than managing. Some organizations are truly led, but most are merely managed,” said General Philip M. Breedlove, the vice chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force.
General Breedlove, who is the second highest ranking officer in the Air Force, cited honesty, decisiveness, and loyalty as traits important for military leaders.
“It’s a little of being in the right place at the right time, having the right jobs, performing well at them, and then surviving to the next grade,” Breedlove said.
But, above all, Breedlove said adaptability, in addition to character, is a key aspect of a successful military officer.
“No plan, no study, no preparation survives contact with the enemy, because the enemy often acts in unpredictable ways,” said General Breedlove. “Chaos happens, and leaders react and overcome.”
But the challenge of overcoming changing circumstances, the panel said, is not one limited to combat.
“Customs and cultural differences are driving the changes in how we do our business,” said Captain Jordan B. Clark, a fuels management officer of the 39th, referring to stints deployed abroad.
These changes, felt both at home and overseas, will affect both current Air Force leaders and the generation of future leaders, said Colonel Joe C. Herron, the director of the Office of Defense Cooperation in the United Kingdom.
In particular, the panelists cited the current domestic economic situation as a challenge that Air Force leaders will have to face in the near future.
“I’ll testify next week in front of Congress to find $450 billion out of the budget in the next 10 years,” Gen. Breedlove said. “Our military needs to be a part of the fiscal recovery of this nation.”
“At the local level, we’ve already had to teach our airmen to be in that mentality to save,”Capt. Clark said.
Now we have to be more fiscally aware of how we handle things in all that we do,” Capt. Clark continued. “We have challenges ahead.”
The forum was one in a series of panel discussions presented by the Leadership Institute at Harvard College.
Since the LIHC’s inception in 2004, the panels have examined leadership in career paths such as business, cooking, and the arts, said J. Craig Herron ’13, who served as the panel’s moderator.
But this panel was the first in the series to examine leadership in the military.
“We wanted to expose students to different kinds of public service, because we usually focus so much on business,” Herron said.
The panel was held in Emerson Hall.

University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith will all visit this Sunday’s meeting of the Undergraduate Council to talk about two hot-button issues and answer questions from the student body.
The visit from these three University bigwigs, who have visited student government meetings in the past but never at the same time, is a more modest version of a program called “Forum for Change” promised by UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Vice President Bonnie Cao ’12 during last fall’s electoral campaign.
“The three main executives who make decisions pertinent to students have graciously agreed to come,” Ebrahim said about the meeting, which is open to the entire student body. “It’s really about getting everyone in the right place at the right time so that when there’s a question that a student has, it can be addressed.”
On Sunday night, the discussion will focus on two topics: a student center and secondary fields. For the last portion of the two-hour meeting, the floor will open for a 20-minute period in which Ebrahim said “anything is fair game.”
Ebrahim recalled an earlier statement in which Faust expressed interest in constructing a new student center, and he said he hopes she will hear enthusiasm for that idea from students at the meeting.
“President Faust building a student center would be the best legacy any president has had among undergraduates since President Lowell built the Houses in the ’30s,” Ebrahim said. “For under 10 million dollars, you can build a dream student center and you’ll be the most awesome president ever.”
In a recent interview, Ebrahim called the Forum for Change, his “number one priority” for his term as UC president. Per his initial vision, students from all schools of the University would be invited to a session twice each semester where Harvard’s top administrators—a group of about 30 people—would all be in the room to field questions and hear grievances.
According to Ebrahim, administrators resisted that plan but agreed after many discussions to attend Sunday’s one-time meeting. Ebrahim said he still has hopes to establish an ongoing apparatus for student-administrator dialogue after this first event. That incarnation may mean a more private discussion or a written channel rather than a physical meeting.
“My goal is to have a substantive space for student engagement,” Ebrahim said.
On Sunday, Ebrahim hopes to see about 100 students attend the meeting, which will be held in Sever Hall 113 at 8 p.m.
“It would be a shame to bring all these senior administrators together and have nobody show up,” he said.
For now, deans and student coordinators say they are looking forward to the event. “Both Deans Hammonds and Smith are pleased to have been invited and to attend this regular meeting of the UC,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal said in an emailed statement.

During this year’s January break, up to 50 students will participate in a two-week writers’ workshop led by Princeton Professor Evan W. Thomas ’73 and Harvard Overseer Walter S. Isaacson ’74, in the most extensive winter session programming yet offered by the College.
The workshop is unique not only because of the number of students who will participate, but also because it will begin meeting several days before the start of “Wintersession,” what the College has labeled the period of time during which all students can return to Cambridge prior to the start of second semester.
The students selected to join Thomas and Isaacson from Jan. 9 through Jan. 21 will be treated to guest lectures by a number of writers, group dinners with teachers, and individual meetings to discuss past writing.
Thomas—who is also a former expository writing preceptor—said he came up with the idea for the program during a conversation with Harvard Overseer Anne Fadiman ’75.
“We were talking about ways to improve the teaching of writing at Harvard. It just occurred to me that now that there is such a thing as a J-Term, this would be a chance to give a short course on how to write,” Thomas said.
While the aim of the course is to improve the writing ability of a select group of Harvard students, none of the participants will actually compose any work during the two-week session.
“I don’t expect people, having just written a whole lot of term papers ... are going to be all that eager to write,” Thomas said.
Instead of putting pen to paper, Thomas’ pupils will be reading the work of the guest lecturers before each makes an appearance in class. The current slate of speakers includes University President Drew G. Faust and bestselling author and journalist Jonathan H. Alter ’79, as well as a number of other authors and journalists.
Thomas also said that he looks forward to co-teaching with Isaacson, with whom he became friends while working together at Time Magazine in the late 1970s.
The pair have since gone on to respected careers in nonfiction writing. Thomas has written 10 books, and won a National Magazine Award for his work at Newsweek. Isaacson—whose biography of the late Steve Jobs will be released early next week—has served as the managing editor of Time Magazine and the Chairman and CEO of CNN.
On his part, Isaacson said he agreed to teach the course because he believes nonfiction writing is a valuable skill. He added that he was also looking forward to working with Thomas, as well as the dozens of students involved in the program.
In an e-mail, Pforzheimer House Resident Dean Lisa Boes, the administrator coordinating Winter Break and Wintersession, said that the writing program is a good example of the range of activities the College hopes to provide in January.
While the winter course will be much more abbreviated than the semester-long class taught by Thomas at Princeton, the professor said that two weeks is plenty of time to make a difference.
“I think you can get the essentials and can actually improve your writing if you are really paying attention for two weeks,” he said.

The case against Stephen Evans—a former Securitas supervisor who was arraigned on April 7 for stealing electronics from Harvard students—was issued a continuance without a finding in late August.
Evans, who was charged with one count of larceny for allegedly stealing a MacBook Pro laptop valued at $2,000 and an Apple iPad valued at $500, did not plead guilty, but rather admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty.
Associate Justice Michele B. Hogan of the Cambridge District Court sentenced Evans to 18 months of administrative probation and 50 hours of community service. Additionally, Evans must stay away from Harvard and stay away from the victims of the larceny.
Evans’ attorney declined to comment on the outcome of this case.
The District Attorney’s Office did not immediately respond to The Crimson’s request for comment.
“The HUPD does not comment about the disposition of court cases,” wrote Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano in an email to The Crimson. “But to clarify no one from the HUPD was consulted regarding the disposition of the Evans case.”
On Oct. 11, two undergraduates left their backpacks unattended in room B04 in the basement of Holworthy Hall and left to eat at 12 a.m. When they returned at 2:15 a.m., they found that their laptops had been stolen from inside their backpacks, according to the incident report.
On Dec. 12, Harvard University Police Department officers responded to a report of stolen property from the B-entryway of Kirkland House. A student reported that he noticed his laptop and iPad were missing when he returned to his room that morning. There were no signs of forced entry into either the entryway or the student’s room, the incident report stated.
Using logs of IP addresses and device-specific Media Access Control addresses aggregated by the University, police determined that a stolen laptop was being used at the Securitas guard station near Wigglesworth. Police identified Evans as a possible suspect in the case after examining swipe logs from the Kirkland incident in December.
On Feb. 8, HUPD officers received an email alert that the targeted MAC address had entered the network. They later confronted Evans at his car and found one of the laptops that had been stolen and an iPad.
Evans agreed to be interviewed by HUPD and said that the laptop in his possession was purchased from a man at the T-stop in Harvard Square for $400. He said the iPad was purchased for $150.
But later in the same interview, Evans admitted to stealing the MacBook Pro from a common room in Holworthy Hall. He also said he found the iPad in Kirkland House and “picked it up and just checked it out ... to see how an iPad works.” Evans said that he intended to return the iPad to its owner.
The officers then identified the scratched serial number to match the number to the iPad that was reported stolen from Kirkland House.
By Feb. 21, only two electronics were recovered from the two incidents, in which a total of four items were stolen.
At the end of the same interview, Evans denied knowledge of the other two devices—both MacBook Pro laptops—in the two cases, stating that he did not have an accomplice in the larcenies and that he had not given any of the items to anyone else.
“I did not get greedy like that,” Evans said, according to the incident report. “I did something I was not raised to do but I did not [take the other laptops].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Muammar Gaddafi, the authoritarian leader that has defined the last 40 years of Libyan public life, was killed Thursday morning while attempting to flee his stronghold in Sirte. Gaddafi’s death brings to an end a repressive era in Libyan history, but one Harvard professor says that Gadaffi’s violent end may undermine the fragile seeds of democracy there.
Chibli Mallat, a visiting professor of Islamic legal studies, expressed concern for the future of Libya after Gaddafi’s death. Mallat said that the decision to kill Gaddafi was poorly informed, noting the need for closure after a 40-year dictatorship.
“I wanted him to stand trial. I’m sorry it ended in this way ... Justice would have been far better served if he had been tried rather than killed,” he said.
While some international observers hoped that Gaddafi would eventually stand trial for abuses committed under his regime, his sudden death avoids a trial that would likely have become a massive public spectacle and distracted the country from other pressing concerns.
“There would have been a great fight about who would have tried him—the courts of Libya or the International Court of Justice,” said E. Roger Owen, a professor of Middle East history, who added that such a process would have shifted attention from moving forward and establishing a democracy.
Mallat said that he much prefers the peaceful tactics employed in Egypt and Tunisia to the violence that has marked the Libyan revolution. Non-violence, Mallat said, has helped lay the groundwork for democracy in Egypt and Tunisia, so Gaddafi’s violent death may undermine stability in Libya.
“This precedent of nonviolence created better opportunities for the long-term nonviolent cause ... Unfortunately, violent death doesn’t bode very well for a new start in Libya,” he said.
“Closure would have been far better for the democratic prospects if he had not been killed,” Mallat added.
Gaddafi ruled Libya for one week short of forty-two years, but on Feb. 17, in the wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring, protests began in Tripoli and lasted until Gaddafi’s fall in August. Gaddafi fled immediately and had not been seen until Thursday morning in Sirte.
“This draws the line under a particularly nasty era in Libya,” Owen said, calling Gaddafi’s death a “clean break with the past.”
“[Gaddafi’s death] is a great boost for the Arab Revolution,” Owen said, adding that tyrants still in power will feel more vulnerable after seeing Gaddafi’s end.
Gaddafi was travelling in a convoy with his guards when attacked by an American drone and a French aircraft. The convoy disbanded, and Gaddafi hid in a sewer with his guards but was soon captured by the rebel soldiers and killed.
Throughout the day, photographs and videos of Gaddafi’s body emerged on the internet. These graphic images displayed his bloodied body and quickly carried the news to the world that Gaddafi had been killed.
Libyans celebrated his death, taking to the streets of Tripoli, cheering and waving flags.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School has launched a new initiative for interdisciplinary research, tying together faculty and students in biology, physics, computer science, and chemistry, among others.
The new program, known as systems pharmacology, will focus on the multifaceted nature of disease and the development of therapeutic drugs.
“A traditional way to do biomedical sciences is being reinvented,” said Peter Sorger ’83, co-chair of the systems pharmacology initiative and a professor of systems biology. “It is an attempt to look at an entire network of interacting proteins. It changes the whole way the system works.”
Leaders of the initiative say they hope the new program will revolutionize disease prevention and treatment by bringing scientists together from  various fields, producing concrete ways to facilitate drug development  at HMS and across the pharmaceutical industry.
Through their work, researchers expect to undertake comprehensive analysis of disease pathways to create specialized target-driven drugs.
Sorger said this focus on target-driven drugs—following a mantra of one drug, one enzyme, and one disease—represents a profound change in pharmaceutical research.
“That is the real ambition here: we change the way patients are treated for really serious diseases,” Sorger said.
Sorger said the targeted-drug approach can enable a new level of drug efficacy and, in turn, patient care and compliance.
Medical schools provide the appropriate venue for the inter-disciplinary approach of systems pharmacology, according to Sorger. While other schools at Harvard, such as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, possess the necessary resources, he said the integration of clinical and laboratory experience in medical schools is ideal for discovery and implementation. Access to both research facilities and training physicians ensures the prospect of bench-to-bedside translation.
Sorger added that the new program will involve undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students.

A man began an attempt to rob Eastern Bank in Harvard   Square on Friday, but got spooked and ran out of the bank before completing the crime. A bank employee then called the Cambridge police, who apprehended a suspect matching the man’s description.
According to branch manager Ramon Marrero, the man entered the bank, which is located in Brattle Square, at about 12:45 p.m. One other customer was in the bank at the time.
Marrero said that the suspect placed a note on the counter, then apparently thought better of it before the teller picked up the paper.
“He got scared and he decided to grab the note and run out,” Marrero said.
Aided by a bank employee’s description of the man as short and dark complexioned with an orange shirt and hooded sweatshirt, Cambridge Police Department officers located the man about nine blocks away at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Putnam Ave., according to Cambridge police spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello.
A witness from the bank identified the suspect as the same man who had attempted to rob the bank, and a police search turned up preexisting warrants for his arrest, Riviello wrote in an emailed statement. He was placed under arrest.
Eastern Bank was robbed of $3,000 this past summer. Marrero said he was unaware of any new  security measures implemented after that incident, nor did he plan to  change any procedures in order to forestall future robberies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As athletes ready themselves to compete at this weekend’s Head of the Charles regatta—an event that drew the attention of more than 300,000 spectators last year—the river has been buzzing with activity.
But for Harvard lightweight rowers junior Matt O’Leary, classmate Erich Schultze, sophomore Michael Wales, and junior Alex Newell, who competed as a quad at the 2011 World Rowing Under-23 Championships this summer, preparation for the upcoming season began many months ago.
“[The international rowing scene] is a completely different world from the world of college athletics,” Schultze said. “It’s a very high level … when you go over there and see the level that the world is at, it becomes really fun to come back to college and have that depth and experience.”
Last spring, O’Leary and Schultze rowed together on the Crimson varsity lightweight boat that finished the dual season undefeated, won Eastern Sprints, and finished .02 seconds shy of a National Championships. Newell raced in the 2V that mirrored the 1V’s dual season Sprints success and competed in the four that won the IRA National Championships. Wales stroked a freshman eight that improved consistently over the course of the season. Soon after Sprints, the quartet made the decision to compete together for a shot at an international regatta.
“We had a bunch of good scullers [looking to compete], and we thought we had a lot of good potential, good athletes, and strong work ethic,” Schultze said. “[Harvard coach Linda Muri] agreed to coach us and it just came about and went from there.”
After earning a victory at the World Championship Trials on New Jersey’s Mercer Lake, O’Leary, Schultze, Wales, and Newell journeyed across the Atlantic to compete at the U-23 World Championships, as Amsterdam played host to a total of 314 crews from 63 nations. Included among this group were 12 former and current Harvard rowers.
“It was a blast to roll over there with all my bros from my team,” Wales said. “We trained with [Muri] right out of the Harvard boathouse ... It was great, because we all know each other on a deeper level now.”
“It was my first time racing internationally,” Newell continued. “Although we didn’t get the results we were hoping for, that experience of racing on the national team was unbelievable.”
Despite barely missing qualification for the semifinal round of the international regatta with a fourth-place finish in its first race, the Harvard lightweight quadruple sculls won the C finals to place 13th overall.
“We didn’t know what to expect or how fast we were in the national scene,” O’Leary said. “That really had an effect in our first race; we didn’t finish in the top three which was necessary to qualify for semifinal ... But it was really good for us to be exposed to those teams.”
The four Harvard rowers—of whom only Schultze had previously raced at U-23 Worlds—gained valuable experience at the championships and bring unprecedented depth to this year’s Harvard lineup.
“Not performing as well as we hoped [we would at Worlds] gives us a lot of motivation to improve this fall and spring and go back and perform better,” Newell said. “The racing experience puts us in a great spot both in terms of fitness and the racing mindset.”
In addition to the depth expected this season, a summer spent rowing together will also likely have a positive impact for the Crimson lightweight squad.
“The biggest way [our experience this summer] helps is with training more than the racing,” O’Leary said. “We all sort of realized that there’s another level of hard work that goes into competing at an international level ... and that has translated into our training this fall.”
“We have each others backs and mesh well together,” Wales continued. “We all had this great experience, so we’re on a similar page about how aggressively we want to come out this season.”
Summer training also evidently played a role in the Crimson’s international success, helping the four rowers adjust to sculling together.
“I had sculled before but never really in a race,” O’Leary said. “But we put in so many hours that I figured it out pretty easily ... [Muri] more than anything else was the reason it wasn’t a disaster, but overall it wasn’t that tough of a transition.”
The transition back to camps hasn’t been too tough either.
“The momentum that you carry from a summer like that is huge,” Schultze said. “It’s rare to have four of us racing internationally. [That kind of] experience brings an atmosphere and level to the fall that some other programs don’t have the benefit of. Our captain Tom [Nesel] and the other guys have done a great job harnessing that energy and making it into a good, fast environment.”

Had Malcolm Howard ’05 never taken another stroke after his days with at Harvard had ended, his three straight undefeated years with the Crimson still would have earned him a place in school history.
Instead, Howard’s star has only shone brighter in the years following his graduation.
He won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the Canadian eight and made an impressive run on the world scene in the single.
But late this summer, Howard dropped his pursuit of individual glory and settled back into his old home in the middle of an eight just in time for 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Slovenia, where the Canadians took bronze.
And now, Howard has just one goal: to be back on top of the world next summer in London.
Back in the day, only two freshman year dual races kept Howard and Aaron Holzapfel ’05 from an immaculate college career.
Barring those blemishes, the duo were unstoppable. Their freshman eight rallied from its early season losses to win Eastern Sprints.
With Howard and Holzapfel rowing, Harvard’s varsity eight never  lost to a collegiate crew. Included among those victories were three straight IRA national championships in the varsity eight.
The summer after their 2004 championship, Howard, Holzapfel, and the rest of the 1V defeated the French and British national teams  to make the finals of Henley Royal Regatta, where the boat was able to maintain overlap with the Dutch national team eight that would take silver at the Athens Olympics that summer.
The duo’s senior year was just as impressive. As the lone holdovers from the 2003 and 2004 crews, Howard and Holzapfel led a young Crimson crew to an undefeated season and a national title.
With three national titles in tow, Howard headed back up north to take his shot at the Canadian national team.
“Malcolm’s the best rower I’ve ever rowed with,” McDaniel said. “No one doubted at that point that Malcolm was going to win an Olympic gold medal.”
Three years later, Howard had a gold medal in hand. The accomplishment did not go unnoticed at Newell.
“In 2010, [the Crimson] named a boat after me,” Howard said. “The varsity boat is the “Malcolm Howard.” The first thing that Harry says [at the dedication] is, ‘Everyone always forgets that there were eight other guys in the boat.’ He was chuckling when he said that. Then he went on and said some really nice things.”
But by that time Howard no longer had eight other guys in his boat. A longtime veteran of the “Engine Room,” the middle four seats of the boat often reserved for the strongest rowers, Howard had decided to start racing the single.
But Howard injured his rib shortly after he returned to training and wound up back in the eight.
In 2010, he gave it another go and took fourth place at the World Cup stop in Lucerne, Switzerland. This summer, Howard again made the finals at Lucerne and placed fifth.
For nearly everyone in the world, these results would represent success. But not for Howard and not for the Canadian national team.
“As a federation and as a country, it’s quite important that we win medals,” he said.
And so this July, the decision was made for Howard to move back into the eight, where he was welcomed back with open arms.
“He’s amazing in the eight,” said Conlin McCabe, Howard’s pair partner at this year’s world championships. “We’re really happy that he decided to join our project.”
A little over a month after Howard joined the eight, Canada took bronze in the world championships.
“We have some really strong guys, and we haven’t spent that much time together rowing,” McCabe said. “We can make some big leaps and bounds.”
As one of the most experienced members of the boat, Howard has emerged as one of the team’s leaders.
“Malcolm has a massive presence, and it’s not just because he’s a big guy,” McCabe said. “He’s a natural leader on the team.”
One of the youngest members of the 2008 eight, Howard is now excited to work with younger athletes such as McCabe, who was part of the Huskies’ 2011 national champion varsity eight.
“The guy sitting in front of me … is one of the strongest guys on the erg in North America,” Howard remarked. “When you’re rowing with someone like that, it’s exciting.”
The 21-year-old McCabe has embraced the chance to work with a rower he used to admire.
“Before I ever met Malcolm, I looked up to him,” McCabe said. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, he’s so strong’ … I wanted to be there, competing with him on the erg. I thought “I’m rowing with Malcolm, I’m going to bring my A game.’”
It’s a sentiment shared by everyone who has rowed with Howard. The king of the engine room, Howard raises the bar and makes everyone around him better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When many current members of Radcliffe lightweight crew first arrived at Harvard, they never anticipated that they would no longer be under the close guidance and leadership of former Black and White head coach Heather Cartwright.
Over the span of  three years, Cartwright led the Radcliffe lightweights to a 15-6 dual record over the course of her three-year run, and three straight fourth-place finishes at the IRA National Championships.
But after a 6-2 mark in her final year,  Cartwright decided to step away from the Weld Boathouse in order to attend to a health concern. The move left the Black and White both saddened about Cartwright’s departure and also wondering about the future.
“It was upsetting to us all when we were told that someone who has had a continuous presence in our lives wasn’t going to be there anymore,” senior coxswain Maryana Vrubel said. “We were really close to coach Cartwright, so while we were surprised, we completely understood her reasons, and we knew that it was for her benefit.”
But their initial shock disintegrated and their hopes soared with the mid-summer hiring of Michiel Bartman as head coach of the Radcliffe lightweights on July 26.
“We were really excited when [Michiel Bartman] was hired,” Vrubel said. “I mean, if you look at his resume—Olympic champion, great experience with lightweights, competing at the international level—we were all very happy that he wanted to become part of our program.”
A legendary rower in his native Netherlands and a successful head coach for six years at the Vesper Boat Club in Philadelphia, Michiel Bartman has put together an impressive resume both in the water as an athlete and on the riverbanks as a coach.
“I didn’t believe it when I heard he was hired over the summer,” said junior lightweight rower Erich Schultze, who rowed with Bartman at Vesper in 2010. “His experience speaks for itself, what he’s accomplished as an athlete. And I think he’s translated that really well into coaching. The sessions I had with him in Philadelphia were some of the best I’ve ever had. It’s astonishing for the women’s team to have him here at Harvard.”
During his athletic career, Bartman first broke onto the international stage when he and his teammates won the gold medal for their native country at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the eights. Bartman followed up on his Olympic gold with a silver medal performance at the 2000 Sydney games in the quadruple sculls. And then, in 2004, Bartman capped off his decorated rowing career with silver in the men’s eights competition at the Athens Olympics and the award of Amsterdam Sportsman of the Year.
In addition to Olympic glory, over the course of his 20-plus years of competitive racing, the Dutch native has brought home three world championships medals, 13 World Cup medals as a competitor for the Netherlands, and more than 100 gold medals for his rowing clubs.
But after an illustrious career on the water, Bartman sought a transition to full-time coaching in order to impart his experience, passion, and expertise to young athletes in the boathouse. Furthermore, Bartman was eager to fulfill his long-time ambition of living and working in the United States.
So when the head coaching position at the world-renowned Vesper Boat Club opened up, Bartman saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity he could not pass by.
“As a teenager I had always had thoughts about living and working in the United States, it always appealed to me,” Bartman said. “So when I had the opportunity at Vesper in 2005, of combining a hobby with a profession and working and being able to live in the United States, it was just perfect to me.”
So with just two suitcases in tow, Bartman set off to Philadelphia to take helm of the 146-year-old Vesper Boat Club—a club whose stated goal is “to produce Olympic champions.”
But Bartman easily rose to the occasion as he quickly established a track record of success at No. 10 Boathouse Row.
During his six-year tenure, Bartman honed elite athletes and prepared them to compete in international competitions, such as the World Rowing Championships and the Olympic Games. Two of his most prominent alums include Andrew Byrnes and Josh Inman, who won gold and bronze in the men’s eight respectively, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
But not totally satiated with his success at Vesper, Bartman sought a new challenge in the form of collegiate coaching at Harvard.
“I liked my job at Vesper,” Bartman said. “But it is a club program, and for me to gain some additional learning experience for the future, collegiate coaching was a step that I had to make.”
“I already had an impression of rowing at Harvard and of the university, so when [Harvard lightweight coach] Charley Butt called me up and said, ‘Maybe I can drop your name for the lightweight women’s position,’ I gave him the go-ahead, because I thought that this would be a great opportunity for me,” Bartman said
By stepping into this new role as Radcliffe lightweight head coach, Bartman is cognizant of the new challenges he will face at the collegiate level. Nevertheless, he also confident that his tenure at Vesper has already given him the necessary tools to meet those challenges head-on.
“I have been in the position now for four weeks, and it is not much different from what I am used to at Vesper,” Bartman said. “Recruiting is obviously more intense, but other than that, I coached lightweight women at Vesper,  and I had some of my best successes with the lightweight women at Vesper.
“So in that sense, it is nothing new. But just being in a bigger environment than Vesper, it has been a personal education for me just to work more with more people, with coaches, coaches from other sports, etc.”
Having just spent six weeks on the job so far, Bartman has already conquered one of the main challenges every new coach faces by coming into a new team—winning over his players.
“He’s done a great job just getting us up to speed on our technique and getting us fit again,” Vrubel said. “I think that with our attitude and his competitive leadership, we have had a really great start to the year.”
“I think that he’s fitting in with the team really well and his personality is meshing really well with us,”  co-captain Emma Lukasiewicz added. “We are all really excited to have him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We had a race at Navy in Annapolis, and then we took the bus ride home eight hours. I got to Eleganza maybe a half-hour before it started, and did it—it’s always hectic in the spring.”
Tim Moore is used to jam-packed schedules. In fact, he thrives on them.
Moore, a senior on the lightweight rowing team, is entering his fourth year rowing for Harvard. According to captain Tom Nesel, Moore brings a unique drive to the varsity squad.
And he has rowing in his blood. Perhaps it can explain why Moore’s able to balance diverse clubs and a senior thesis with the year-round sport he’s played all his life.
Sitting in Dunster courtyard, donning a Harvard crew shirt and a faux-hawk, Moore reminisced about his introduction to crew.
“My mom used to take me out in her launch when I was three,” he said.
Moore had two strong influences, guiding him to begin rowing. Both parents, Marshall ’79 and Becky ’79, rowed for Harvard and Radcliffe, respectively. Both parents serve as coaches and his mom works as one of the heads of Friends of Harvard and Radcliffe Rowing. Growing up in New England, or as Moore calls it “Now England,” he was always surrounded by the sport.
Moore has come a long way since his days sitting in diapers in his mom’s boat. He began rowing on the national level at his high school, Phillips Exeter, with the heavyweight team. Now, he is an integral part of the lightweight first varsity eight at Harvard. Starting his college career rowing in the first freshman boat, he has continued getting stronger and faster throughout his time at Harvard, rowing in the first varsity boat since his sophomore year.
“He’s pretty warrior-esque,” Nesel said of Moore’s rowing personality. “Every time we are on the erg, he fights it to the death…he doesn’t let go.”
Nicknamed “Crazyhorse,” Moore has a quirky personality and tries to do things outside the box, according to Nesel.
Moore’s activities outside of rowing are fairly diverse.
One night a week, Moore travels to Suffolk as part of a PBHA program to tutor inmates in their county prison for GED prep. He also holds an on-campus job.
When the weather gets warm again, Moore’s other activities start to heat up.
In the spring, Moore steps with the Black Men’s Forum (BMF), which performs in Eleganza.
“I started stepping at Exeter, and that’s how I got into it here,” Moore said. “It’s another good team of guys I enjoy hanging out with.”
Apart from his rowing team and BMF team, Moore also models in Eleganza.
“Eleganza is a fun, fairly social thing,” Moore explained. “It’s another way to meet people outside of crew, which is really nice.”
Besides modeling, stepping, working, tutoring, and rowing, Moore is planning ahead to get a considerable portion of his thesis done before the spring practices and races start up.
Moore’s roommate Bob Santamaria,  a fellow Social Studies concentrator, admires Moore’s work ethic.
“Not that many people can be Social Studies concentrators and athletes,” Santamaria commented. “Being able to handle that workload is amazing.”
Even though spring is much more hectic, Moore thrives on the busy schedule.
“The increased structure makes me work faster,” he said. “I wouldn’t do all these things unless I really enjoyed them. There’s so much offered here and I always want to try to take advantage of it all.”
Santamaria says that besides playing intramural sports, Moore is scarcely seen around Dunster because he’s so busy.
“He always swings through the common room, though,” Santamaria noted. “When he’s here, he’s a fixture with his headphones at his desk, working after dinner until he goes to sleep.”
Moore has always had an interest in travel and other cultures. His thesis is on Afro-Colombian identity, and he hopes to go abroad after graduation after living in New England his whole life up to this point.
But while international experiences may lie head, Moore is currently focused on a challenge much closer to home: the Head of the Charles.
The Harvard lightweights haven’t won the event in the three years that he has rowed, but Moore hopes to change that this year.
“It would be awesome to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight official national championships. Eight more unofficial national championships. Twenty-seven Eastern Sprints titles in the varsity eight, and 21 in the second varsity. Twenty-one undefeated dual seasons.
Harry Parker is unquestionably a winner. But the statistics are only the tip of the iceberg.
They don’t tell the full story of the man who forever changed rowing at Harvard and across North America. His influence can be seen across the continent in the way crews train and compete, and it can be felt just as profoundly in the lives of his former rowers.
Parker’s story is one of curiosity, creativity, courage, and commitment. The water is merely his medium. For non-rowers and lifelong veterans alike, there is much to be learned from this coaching legend.
BORN INNOVATOR
Parker first became interested in coaching during his undergraduate years at the University of Pennsylvania, where he rowed in the two seat of the varsity eight after joining the team as a walk-on.
“I became quite close with the then rowing coach, Joe Burk,” he explained. “We did a lot of talking about various aspects of the coaching, and it really intrigued me.”
So Parker, who had already enlisted in the Navy, applied to coach at the U.S. Naval Academy. He didn’t get the job, but the seed had been planted.
Parker’s shot would come soon enough. While he was in the Navy, he was also training to race the single in the 1959 Olympics and 1960 Pan American Games. While racing in England, he became connected to the school he’d call his for a half-century.
“We went to Henley, and I got talking to the then-Harvard coach, and it turns out about a year later they were looking for somebody, and I got it,” he said. “There you go.”
Parker’s days as an assistant coach came to an end when head coach Harvey Love died suddenly of a heart attack. As has now become school legend, Parker took over the program as interim head coach in 1963.
After the team posted uninspiring performances in the dual season and at Eastern Sprints, Parker took the time between Sprints and Harvard-Yale to refocus on the fundamentals.
When the Crimson shocked the favored Bulldogs with a come-from-behind victory, Harvard immediately named Parker head coach, and the Crimson rose to prominence quickly.
Harvard took the Eastern Sprints title every year from 1964 to 1970. Parker’s 1968 varsity eight beat out Burk’s Penn crew for the right to represent the U.S. at the Mexico City Olympics.
It was the last collegiate crew ever to represent the U.S. in the Olympic eight.
While Parker started coaching in the style of his old mentor, Joe Burk, a trip to Europe would soon change rowing on the Charles—and in North America—forever.
“I got curious right away with what was going on not just in US intercollegiate rowing but internationally because there was a big big change that took place in the late 50s and early 60s in Europe,” he recalled.
Parker was particularly intrigued by the rise of the Karl Adam’s Ratzeburg crews from West Germany.
“There was a big change in technique, in equipment, in training, and I think it’s no exaggeration to call it a revolution in the way that it affected rowing,” he said. “I was intrigued by that, and so I began to look for things that they were doing that I could incorporate into my coaching, and quite frankly I’ve continued to do that ever since.”
Some of these changes were in the kinds of equipment that his crews used; Harvard started importing English oars and various European boats, from the Swiss Staempflis used in the 1960s to the empachers used by today’s varsity crews.
Parker was also the first American coach to employ interval training, another idea pioneered by Adam.
But it would be unfair to call Parker’s style simply an American adaptation of Adam’s. Parker has continued to study the sport long after his trip to Germany.
“He’s always studying, thinking, probing, and he’s always been good at the mechanics and science of boats, rigging, and training,” Dick Cashin ’75 said in an e-mail.
“There have been various moments when things have been very stable with few changes, but overall [I’m] continuing to change as I see and learn things that are a little different—and maybe a little bit better,” Parker added.
A MAN OF FEW WORDS?
“I have to say, the myth of me not having too much to say is not very accurate,” Parker asserted.
Actually, Parker has plenty to say. He just doesn’t waste his words.
“Whatever Harry said, it was law,” said Henrik Rummel ’09, who rowed under Parker for four years and is currently training with the U.S. national team. “It’s kind of unique. There was never any questioning of Harry. It was very clear cut that everyone was on board.”
And Parker never needs to raise his voice to get his point across.
“I’m not a yeller or a screamer or a shouter or abusive,” he said. “My coaching style is basically, you know, coaching people, if you will, to get it right, encouraging them when they do. I tend not to be critical when they don’t or negative. I think it’s fair to say my coaching style is positive reinforcement.”
Parker also eschews the traditional pre-race pep talk for much briefer words of wisdom.
“Nothing is more powerful than when a coach comes up to you before your final race and says ‘All you have to do is keep doing what you’ve always been doing,’” Malcolm Howard ‘05 reminisced.
Parker was even more succinct with Cashin. Also a Crimson squash player, Cashin rowed in the “Rude and Smooth” crews of 1974 and 1975. The crews which went undefeated against collegiate competition to win the “unofficial national championship” and defeated the U.S. National team en route to finishing second to the British National team at the Henley Royal Regatta.
Cashin and classmate Al Shealy also won the World Championships in 1974 and competed in the 1976 Olympics.
“In ’74, we were in Seattle to race a Washington crew full of national team members, and we were tired at the end of a tough trip where we had to go to the limit to beat Wisconsin twice the week before—we hadn’t lost in two years, and only once in four years,” Cashin wrote. “The night before, we’re falling asleep … Harry walks in and stands by the window looking out for a couple minutes at the Lake Washington in the distance.Rick, Al and I look at each other. Harry turns to walk out and as he’s leaving, he says ‘Race day.’ We just lay there saying ‘Race day? Is that it? Is that the pep talk? Is that all there is?’”
It was enough.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
They say it’s not the size of the dog in the fight, it’s the size of the fight in the dog. Not everyone in the athletic world believes that, but Parker does.
A smaller heavyweight himself, Parker was nonetheless able to be highly successful in the single, which he trained for while he was serving in the Navy. He won gold at the 1959 Pan-American games and took fifth in the 1960 Olympics in Rome.
Perhaps because of his own success, Parker has always been willing to give smaller rowers a chance to succeed.
“I’m relatively small,” Kip McDaniel '04 explained. “I’m 6’1”; I raced at 185 pounds. I thank my stars [for Parker’s coaching]. Under other coaches I wouldn’t have the same opportunities. I think he saw in me similar qualities [to him]. I had a great opportunity that I don’t think I would have had at other programs.”
Parker’s faith in McDaniel paid off. The small heavyweight stroked the first varsity eight to back-to-back undefeated seasons and national championships in his junior and senior years.
Parker also doesn’t stress uniformity in the same way other coaches do.
“Harry is good at using what you have,” Cashin wrote. “He doesn’t change people to row a standard way-He just works the blade work and gets you using what you can do a little better.”
Parker’s egalitarian nature is not limited to talented rowers of different sizes and stroke styles. He is also eager to work with rowers of different ability levels.
“He’ll spend time with everyone,” captain Mike DiSanto said. “He’ll treat them just the same on and off the water.”
Parker’s concern with the performance of the whole team has paid off. Just last year, every single Crimson eight went undefeated during the dual season.
“From the bottom up, the bottom guy in the team pushes the guy ahead of him,” DiSanto said. “You have guys pushing each other all the way ... everyone down there just wants to win. Everyone just wants to give their best. He has installed that in our program.”
TOUGHNESS
“If Harvard is tied with you at the thousand, you can damn well be sure you’re going to lose to them at the finish,” McDaniel said.
All of Parker’s innovations in technique and training would have been for naught had his crews lacked the toughness to compete.
But luckily for the Crimson, Harry’s mental toughness and his ability to find it in his rowers are among his greatest strengths.
“I’ve been coached by many people,” said McDaniel, who rowed on the Canadian national team from 2005 to 2008. “The mental toughness he instills in his athletes is unparalleled."
One beneficiary was Howard.
“When I got to Harvard, I was a talented rower,” he said. “But I don’t think I was a very good racer.”
“Malcolm was always a phenomenal physical specimen,” recalled McDaniel, who raced against Howard in high school. “But I was able to beat him.”
But that changed when Howard got to Harvard.
“A lot of what I learned from Harry was how to race,” Howard said. “He gives you that fire inside of that makes you want to go out and win … and I thought each season and each year under Harry, I became a better racer.”
Howard’s three straight undefeated seasons with the Crimson and 2008 Olympic gold medal would certainly suggest so.
COURAGE
All rowers are competitive, but even the toughest of oarsmen say that Parker’s desire and willpower are unique.
“He would always jump right in and compete with us,” Peter Lowe ‘74 remembered. “He would go over to the stadium; he’d play soccer with us when it got too windy.”
“The guy was really amazing,” Shealy added. “It was a really phenomenal sight. He just would not want to be beaten. He would almost kill himself in some of these alternative training methods. Our jaws were slack most of the time watching him compete.”
The games didn’t stop when the rowers graduated.
“After we graduated, a number of us stayed in touch,” Lowe said. “We continued to compete with him in running or road races or cross country ski races or now on the golf course. His oarsmen loved to compete against him ... his intensity and focus and concentration were inspirational.”
Recently, Parker has had to apply his willpower to matters more severe than sport. Earlier this year, he was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome, a type of blood cancer. The first clue that something was amiss was a kidney infection, which was first noticed at this year’s Eastern Sprints.
Perhaps it’s the years in the Navy, perhaps it’s his miles in the single, or perhaps it’s because he’s taken sport so seriously for so long, but Parker has been able to approach his cancer as if it were another big race.
“I’ve never seen anyone approach cancer with such toughness,” McDaniel said. “The character traits that he likes in rowers--persistence, stubbornness--he’s using them to deal with the hurdle well. I’ve never seen anyone approach it in the same way.”
FATHER FIGURE
“I think anybody who’s rowed for him has a special relationship with him,” Shealy said. “He’s kind of like a second father ... The guy’s an amazing coach, an amazing human being. We were all very fortunate to have intersected each other’s lives.”
Parker’s dedication and character have inspired legions of rowers to want to win for him.
“You wanted to perform for the guy, to make him satisfied,” Shealy said. “It really was about the Harvard tradition, about appeasing the gods, and doing the best you could for the man.”
DiSanto felt similarly this summer when his crew took silver in at the IRA national championships. It was the first time the Crimson 1V had medalled since 2007, but DiSanto had been hoping to give his mentor more.
“He’s kind of gotten us to not just want to row for ourselves,” DiSanto added. “When I got off the water at IRAs, I didn’t really feel bad for myself. I felt that I had let him down. I think he was very proud of us, but all of us wanted to win that one for him.”
AN ENDURING LEGACY
Not even cancer can keep Harvard’s most successful coach from the boathouse.
“He just wanted to be around us every day,” DiSanto said. “He wasn’t going to let a kidney infection or leukemia keep him from getting to the boathouse every day and coaching. He could’ve taken time off last year. That’s what most people would’ve done. I don’t think he wants to. He just loves coming down to the boathouse and coaching. We love having him there.”
Parker has made it clear that he has no intention of leaving coaching.
“It’s so fun,” he said. “I still enjoy the coaching, I enjoy the challenges, developing each squad and seeing if we can come up with fast crews. It’s not a question that comes up for me. It just seems like the natural thing to do.”
But someday, whether soon or in the far-off future, Parker will no longer be head coach at Newell. But his influence will remain for years to come.
“On the wall in Newell there’s a poster that says ‘Harry Parker, Head Coach 1963-[infinity]’” junior Josh Hicks noted in an e-mail. “And it’s true. After 50 years of educating rowers, of schooling them in the virtues of determination and courage, there’s no knowing where his influence stops.”
“His legacy is going to be an edifice,” Shealy added. “He is simply irreplaceable. I suspect that he’s going to stay in that position as long as he can. He has left a trail of accomplishment that is unparalleled. People are going to look up to him, as we all do, and revere him for many decades to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the face of Radcliffe lightweight crew has changed drastically over the past year, the team has found stability and leadership in co-captain Marissa Reichel.
“Marissa is an amazing athlete and a great leader on the team,” senior coxswain Maryana Vrubel said.  “She’s been doing a really great job as captain. It’s nice to have someone so dependable on the team.”
Reichel and dependability on the water have gone hand-in-hand throughout her rowing career.
Dating back to her days with Wayland-Weston Crew in high school, Reichel helped lead the way to four Massachusetts state championships.
Reichel has raced in the Black and White varsity eight since her freshman year and has earned two medals at Eastern Sprints in the process.
Reichel spent much of her sophomore and junior years in the coveted stroke seat. Her steady rhythm on the water and quiet leadership set the pace for her crew.
“On land, she is pretty reserved in certain ways, but once she gets that oar in her hands, she becomes very competitive,” Radcliffe coach Michiel Bartman said. “That’s what you want to see.”
But after former coach Heather Cartwright stepped down, Reichel and her teammates faced a new challenge that can often devastate an entire season: unfamiliarity at the helm.
But the unknown proved to be a boon for the team when the Harvard athletic department hired Bartman as head coach.
Reichel has helped welcome Bartman to Cambridge, and the two have developed a strong respect for each other.
“Michiel is an amazing coach, and I have only good things to say about him,” Reichel said. “He has adapted to coaching college lightweights very smoothly in the last six weeks. He has a really positive coaching style; if we ever have a piece that doesn’t go the way we want it to, he asks us what was good and what was bad about the piece, and how we can improve the bad parts.”
Bartman also sees the dependability in Reichel that her teammates have witnessed over the past three seasons.
“I’ve only known her for six weeks, but in the time that I have known her, she has been very motivated and a hard worker,” Bartman said. “When she steps into a boat you notice a change.”
Despite having a new coach, the Black and White squad has high hopes for coming the year.
“Every year, our team has raised its expectations,” Reichel said. “This year, especially, we’ve been working towards achieving our high goals. Our team is very cohesive, and we have a great team dynamic. Everyone pushes each other to row well and to get faster.”
A strong performance last spring gives the squad a good base off which to build.  The first varsity eight placed fourth at the IRA National Championships and took bronze at Eastern Sprints.
With the Head of the Charles just around the corner, the Black and White varsity has continued its diligent practice regimen and even added a few twists to prepare for its biggest race of the year.
“Preparation for the Head of the Charles always involves a lot of long, steady state pieces and AT rowing,” Reichel said. “This year, with Michiel, we are practicing rowing in rough water and windy conditions. Conditions in the basin are usually pretty bad—windy, and sometimes there are whitecaps. A big part of rowing is being able to make the best of the conditions and the situation you are placed in.”
As the Radcliffe lightweight squad hits the water on Oct. 22, it will look to ride its success into the Head of the Charles.
“The race is really exciting for us as rowers because crew is not a big spectator sport, and this is one of the few races that we get a huge crowd out to watch us and cheer us on,” Reichel said.
With the immense crowd lining the Charles, Harvard will look to get in the zone and follow its own pace.
For yet another race, the team will turn to Reichel and her experience to keep cool and find its rhythm.
“You grow up and you gain experience with every single race,” Vrubel said. “You look to the people you’ve raced with [before] to keep you calm, and Marissa is one of those people who on race day is always ready and makes you feel better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the major challenges facing any college student centers around the fact that there are so many things to do, see, enjoy, and experience during one’s undergraduate years.
The challenge of walking a tightrope between different time commitments is even larger for the numerous student-athletes at Harvard.
Between classes, team practices, conditioning, extracurricular commitments, weekend trips for games and races, and maintaining social relationships, one would think that maintaining such a hectic lifestyle, much less succeeding at it, would be extremely difficult.
Not so in the case of senior rower Liz Soutter, who over her four years on the Radcliffe heavyweight crew team has found tremendous success not only in the water but also on campus.
Last season, Soutter rowed exclusively with the varsity eight and reinforced her status as a true impact player for the Radcliffe heavyweights.
The varsity eight was able to record landmark victories throughout the course of the season, including a win over Yale for the Black and White’s first Case Cup victory since 2003 and a win in the third-level final at NCAA Championships. Soutter, who rowed mostly in the five seat, was named second-team All-Region for her efforts.
Yet Soutter’s tremendous success for the Radcliffe heavyweights has in no way impeded her ability to succeed in other aspects of her college experience.
“Liz Soutter is great,” co-captain Kirsten von Fossen said. “I think a lot of girls look up to Liz because she just does so much.  It’s amazing. She’s head of her HoCo, she’s done tons of fashions shows, and she’s the best-dressed on the team. But she just has a great personality. She’s always bright, and it’s so great to have her around the boathouse—she lifts everyone’s mood. Not to mention that she’s a great rower.”
“I do really well as rower, but I also have a very good sense of balance,” Soutter said. “I think I strike a healthy balance with rowing, school, and my other interests for two reasons. Primarily I’m very clear with myself about what my priorities are. Obviously, crew is very high on that list—I have no doubts about that. I also strike a healthy balance because I try to do things that I genuinely enjoy doing.”
In addition to her position in the Black and White varsity eight, the social anthropology concentrator serves as the chair of the Lowell House Committee. Soutter has also served as the Freshman Week coordinator for Crimson Key Society and has designed clothing for campus fashion shows Identities, Haute, and  Cocktails & Couture.
“I’ve made a lot of close friends in Lowell House, and that is why participating on the House Committee has been such an incredible experience for me,” Soutter said. “Doing HoCo doesn’t feel like a job, it’s just a really fun experience. That’s the same with rowing—yes, it’s definitely a lot of work, but I wouldn’t be doing it if I didn’t love it so much, and if I didn’t value the friendships I’ve made and the experiences I’ve had along the way.”
Looking towards the future and what her legacy for the team will be after the end of this season, Soutter hopes that her ability to balance many different commitments and also have a highly enriching and successful college experience will serve as a model for her teammates and others.
“I think a big misconception about varsity athletes is that you can’t have a social life, or that they don’t do well in school, and that they certainly can’t do well in all three because one of them has to give,” Soutter said. “But I dont think that is true at all. That is one thing that I have done a good job at throughout college is just having a very good balance between all areas of my life, and that is definitely something that my teammates look up to me for. I hope that they will remember me by that.”
It is this same sense of balance between all the different aspects of her college experience that has earned Soutter glowing admiration and respect from many of her teammates and friends.
After graduation, Soutter, a native of Toronto, Ontario, hopes to start a career in marketing. She believes that her involvement and experiences with Radcliffe crew has been invaluable in shaping her as an individual.
“My experience for Radcliffe crew has definitely been a learning experience,” Soutter said. “Not only about rowing, but also about myself and what I am capable of.”
What Soutter prides as crew’s core learning experience is its value on both teamwork as well as personal achievement.
“You learn a lot from working in a program that has very much of a team aspect as well as a very strong individual component,” she said. “Rowing has definitely taught me a lot about working on a team and also about trying to make personal strides, but also supporting those around you and challenging your teammates around you so they also make strides.”
She also recognizes the tremendous influence that her teammates and coaches have had on her during her time as a member of the Radcliffe heavyweights.
“My coaches have definitely taught me a lot,” she said. “All of them have taught me something different in terms of leadership skills, and they are all people I aspire to be like when I’m grown up, when I am a parent, and when I have a job. I also aspire to be like my teammates in the sense that they have taught me to be just as competitive as they are. They have taught me to be competitive but also being a good teammate and the support that I get from them, and I always try to give back.”
The senior will try to put her competitive drive to use in this weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta, where she will row in Radcliffe’s top boat in the Championship Eight event. Soutter hopes that Sunday’s race will serve as an indication of the team’s progress thus far to itself and its competitors.
“It’s really fun to race in the Head of the Charles,” Soutter said. “We’d like to have a good showing at the Head of the Charles just so that we can show others where we are and where we are going to be in the spring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the pace picks up in the boat, balance is needed to keep it steady and on course.
And for Kirsten Van Fossen, the same balance is needed to manage everything else in her fast-paced life. In addition to being co-captain of Radcliffe heavyweight crew, the senior is also pursuing a degree in engineering sciences and singing for an all-female a cappella group, the Harvard Fallen Angels.
“Kirsten’s influence on the team has always been one of determination,” senior Liz Soutter said. “You will always catch her trying to work on her strength after practice or staying on top of her homework, so that she can get a good night’s sleep.”
The life of an engineering student can be one filled with many required classes and time-intensive labs—commitments that often interfere with daily afternoon practices.
To help make her schedule work, Van Fossen has relied heavily on administrators and teachers to help her navigate her busy schedule.
“This semester, I can’t go to a [required thesis] class because of rowing, so I am meeting with the professor on a monthly basis,” Van Fossen said. “It’s worked out really well.”
Van Fossen is also quick to thank her coaches for helping her achieve goals both on and off the water.
“I feel like they know how to get the best out of you, and they have definitely pushed me a lot over the past three-and-a-half years,” the senior said.
Sometimes Van Fossen’s academic pursuits took her down the river to MIT in between practices. During Harvard’s spring break, the crew team holds daily training. But because of MIT’s schedule, Van Fossen’s regular classes were still in session and conflicted with practice.
“We would train in the morning and the afternoon—sometimes three times a day—but on the days I had class, the coaches were really understanding,” Van Fossen said. “I just ran over to class in between practices.”
Van Fossen says the passion for engineering she brought to college has allowed her to manage rigorous athletic and academic schedules.
“The reason I have been able to do engineering with rowing is because I knew I wanted to do engineering from the get-go,” she said. “I think it would be really hard if you experimented with classes your freshman year, and then you had to do the 20 requirements. I had finished four requirements by the end of my freshmen year.”
One thing Van Fossen did not start right away was singing. A violinist in high school, Van Fossen went through her freshman year without pursuing any form of music.
“I never sang in high school,” Van Fossen said. “I didn’t want to continue with [orchestra] … but I wanted to continue with music somehow. Freshman year, I was looking around but didn’t try out for [any singing groups].”
But during her sophomore year, Van Fossen auditioned for Fallen Angels and joined the group, which calls itself “Harvard’s premiere all-female contemporary a cappella group.”
For a cappella groups, recruiting periods and Hell Week, the week before a big performance, can require time commitments of up to six hours a day. But for Van Fossen, the scheduling somehow finds a way of working out.
“It just seems to work out perfectly,” she said. “Recruiting week is right when we get back to school, so crew is not super crazy yet. And then crew starts to die down when the [Fallen Angels] fall concert happens.”
Van Fossen has recruited several rowers to join her in Fallen Angels, including sophomore Katie Wilcox.
“[Van Fossen] is very loyal to both the crew team and Fallen Angels,” Wilcox said. “She’s an asset to both, and she will definitely be missed next year.”
Wilcox has been impressed by Van Fossen’s commitments and her ability to manage everything she has chosen to invest herself in.
“She’s not one to gripe about what she has to do and waste time. She will finish practice, go to dinner, go to the library for a few hours and get her stuff done. It’s really impressive.”
Despite her numerous accolades and achievements off the water, Van Fossen is making the most noise on it. Last summer, while not working at her internship with Urban Outfitters, Van Fossen trained with Vesper Boat Club in Philadelphia.
“She trained hard over the summer, and made incredible strides because of it,” Soutter said. “The improvements Kirsten has made over the past four years, let alone the last two months, have really opened everyone’s eyes to the possibilities of what we are all capable of.”
Wilcox agrees and believes Van Fossen’s hard work over the summer is helping not only Kirsten’s performance, but also the performance of the team in general.
“Kirsten leads by example,” Wilcox said. “She worked incredibly hard over the summer on her strength and fitness, and she is really inspiring people right now with how well she is doing on the erg and on the water.”
For Van Fossen, when everything piles up and the week gets tough, taking a second to reflect on her passions make it easy to do everything with such ease.
“I think about what I like about each thing and why I want to continue doing each. For crew, I love the team, I love to work out, and I’m a competitive person. For Fallen Angels, it’s a great group of girls and sometimes it’s relaxing to sing for two hours. And in engineering, I love the problem solving.”

For those looking to take their Crimson fandom to the next level, it’s time to stop procrastinating your way through that paper by checking Facebook every three minutes—and time to make the move to Twitter. Here’s a chance to get to know Harvard’s biggest athletes in their everyday lives (without them even realizing it).
The Crimson’s Twitter prowess starts with the men’s basketball team. These guys have honed their tweeting skills, making them the preeminent contributors of 140-character sentences on campus.
Here are a few accounts that stand out.
For a deeper look at the status of the team, a good first stop is @bcrimson10 (junior guard Brandyn Curry). “This hate fuels the fire that's burning on harvards campus. Keep it coming. We absolutely love it #killseason,” he tweeted in late September.
Follow @KWright44 (basketball co-captain Keith Wright) to find some musical insight along with your dose of basketball knowledge: “I better not hear anyone say that tha carter IV is better than cole world: a sideline story,” Wright recently tweeted.
Looking for fashion tips? Look no further than @omcnally11 (co-captain Oliver McNally), who says, “If I ever wrap a sweater around my waist, I'd have to kick my own ass.”
You can also catch up with fellow Crimson ballers @crimson_0 (sophomore guard Laurent Rivard), @wesley_shyamm (freshman forward Wesley Saunders), @dgiger21 (junior forward Dee Giger), and @YeezySmith25 (freshman center Kenyatta Smith).
If you’re hoping to be hear some breaking news about the NBA Lockout, you might want to check up on Harvard alumnus @Jlin7 (Jeremy Lin).
Outside of the basketball team, you can get some financial advice from a quarterback @thenugg16 (senior Collier Winters), who recently pointed out that “If I didn't spend money on food, I would probably be pretty close to a millionaire by now... #justsayin.”
Some other  interesting profiles: @TheBearShirt (Ryan Grimshaw) and @Akillorn19 (Alex Killorn) of the men’s hockey team; @thenscottsaid (Scott Yim) of the men’s volleyball team; @Paulyligs41 (Paul Liguori) of the wrestling team; @JosephinePucci (Josephine Pucci) of the women’s hockey team; and @imEMMAude (Emma Golen) of the women’s basketball team.
And of course, you can get your fill of Harvard sports news by following @THCSports.
So get your fill of #CrimsonSports on Twitter, but be wary—you don’t want to be labeled a #stalker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Take notice! Princeton is coming to town. Harvard football, men’s soccer, women’s soccer and field hockey are all facing Tigers at home this weekend.  It looks like it’s going to be a nice weekend in Cambridge with some competitive matchups.
And it’s a good thing the games are at home. Here’s what you won’t be missing out on at Princeton:
1. New Jersey
Even though Princeton, N.J. is a nice area, it is still a part of New Jersey. This fact is a hard one to look past. We all know that New Jersey is the home of the infamous Jersey  Shore. Plus, most New Jersey residents wish they lived in New York, anyway.
2. Rivalry
Of course Harvard wants to beat Princeton this weekend; it’s only natural to desire victory over one's opponents. But the Harvard-Princeton rivalry is an unnatural, almost fabricated one. Princeton wants to have its own rivalry, but it will always be Harvard vs. Yale. Fans, this is not “The Game”—it’s a game.  It always seems like Princeton just feels left out.
3. Brooks Brothers’ Advertisements
The advertisement for Brooks Brothers’ new “Campus Collection” line was recently filmed on Princeton’s campus. Talk about feeding into stereotypes…this ad is exceedingly cheesy and, frankly, just embarrassing.
Plus, it’s Head of the Charles in Cambridge.  Who would want to miss that?

The Harvard football team (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) will look to extend its current four game win streak tomorrow against Ivy rival Princeton (1-4, 1-1) as the teams face off at Harvard Stadium.
After dropping the first game of its season to Holy Cross, the Crimson have bounced back strongly and have won every game since, including conference wins over Cornell and Brown.
A large part of Harvard’s early season success can be attributed to junior quarterback Colton Chapple.
Chapple started the season as the backup to senior Collier Winters, but after Winters was unable to play due to a hamstring injury, the junior quarterback was given the starting nod, and has shown no intention of relinquishing his job anytime soon.
“With every successful outing your confidence grows, but the key is not to get too high or too low at the quarterback position,” Chapple said. “You are never as bad as you think you are and you are never as good as you think you are.”
In week four against Cornell, Chapple threw for over 400 yards, and last week against Bucknell, the Crimson quarterback tied a school record with five touchdown passes in the game.
While the offense has proven strong in the early stages of the season, the Harvard defense has not been overshadowed.
Last week against the Bison, the defense had a very impressive showing, dismantling the Bucknell offense.  The Crimson defense created five turnovers, and held the Bison to minus five rushing yards.
A large part of the defensive success can be attributed to captain Alex Gedeon, who had 11 tackles and 2.5 sacks against Bucknell.
“Our motto on defense is that we want to keep it simple and we want to play fast and play physical,” Gedeon said.
Harvard seems to have it hit its stride—not a good sign for tomorrow’s opponent, Princeton. The Tigers have not started their season off with the same gusto as the Crimson.
Princeton is coming off a 34-0 routing at the hands of Brown—a team that Harvard soundly defeated earlier in the season.
The Tigers will come into the game with their backs against the wall, and if they want any chance to win they will have to play their best game of the season thus far.
Last week against Brown, the Tigers were outplayed on both sides of the field, earning just half as many yards as their opponent.
“I think the keys to this game are going to be how physical we play and executing our defense,” Gedeon said.
Although Princeton might have a bleak record so far this season, the Crimson will not take them lightly.
“To some extent you can throw out those numbers because they will be excited to play,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Harvard is a huge game on their schedule for them and it will be a more challenging game than people on the surface might think it will be.”
Despite their loss to Brown, Princeton opened conference play with a win over Columbia, which keeps it in the Ivy mix.
“Princeton is a good team,” Chapple said. “With one league [win] they are back in the race, so by no means are we going to take this game lightly. It is a big rivalry for us and we are excited to play Princeton and hopefully we can get it done on Saturday.”
On the Crimson side some key players to watch will be Gedeon, Chapple, and offensive tackle Will Whitman.
This week Whitman was named to the Jerry Rice Award Watch List, an accolade that recognizes distinguished freshman in subdivision football.
For Princeton, key players include freshman running back Chuck Dibilio, who has shown promise early in this season and rushed for 78 yards against Brown last week.
On the Tigers’ defense, junior Caraun Reid has been a consistently strong presence on the field this season with 31 tackles and three sacks.
“In our league a lot of [games are] like the playoffs,” Murphy said. “We feel like we are in a playoff game and we know this might not be the number one team on our schedule, but they are a very capable, tough team.”

With three matches left in its season and only one point separating first from third place, the Harvard women’s soccer team looks to defeat Princeton and send the Tigers back home with a loss for the fourth time in five years.
The Crimson (9-4-1, 3-0-1 Ivy) takes on Princeton (4-8-1, 1-3-0) at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium tomorrow night as it goes for its third consecutive win.
Currently atop the Ivy League, Harvard looks to continue its early season success and recapture the Ivy title that eluded it in 2010.
“I think this season has been interesting,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “Overall, it has been great so far. We’re doing really well. We’re continually improving, and I can’t complain, but we definitely have a long way to go. We’re just trying to keep our heads on straight and take it one game at a time.”
In order to stay at its current ranking, the Crimson needs to pull out a strong performance against the Tigers, a team that, though struggling early in league play, beat higher-seeded Columbia last weekend.
“They’re a fantastic team,” Baskind said. “We’re expecting their best. We’re trying to rival the competition that they are going to bring, as well as their competitive energy. It’ll be two really good teams going at each other—it’s going to be a great game.”
Harvard coach Ray Leone emphasized Baskind’s point, discussing the dominance of Princeton’s offense.
“We’re going to have to play very, very well to be successful against Princeton,” Leone said. “They’re an outstanding team and, I think, have scored 11 goals in the last three games [before Oct. 18].”
Leone was correct. Against Francis Marion, Lehigh, and Columbia, the Tigers notched six, one, and four goals, respectively, followed by a blowout win over Utah Valley on Tuesday, in which the Tigers scored another five.
Princeton’s offense stems largely from junior forward Jen Hoy and freshman midfielder Lauren Lazo. In the last two games alone, Hoy has scored three goals, the most on the team.
Lazo has also provided her share of goals, finding the net before the eight-minute mark in three out of the last four matches.
To compete against this offensive firepower, Harvard will need its goalkeepers to be on their game, including freshman Bethany Kanten, who received Ivy Co-Rookie of the Week honors last week.
“We have a great goalkeeping tandem,” Leone said. “All of them have played, and all of them have done well. [Kanten], for example, has improved throughout the season, and we’re really pleased with where she is right now.”
Kanten agreed with Leone, citing the importance of the goalkeeper’s role in keeping the overall group intensity high.
“I think it’s really important for me to keep the energy of the whole team up,” Kanten said. “I [play] a big part in communicating with the team and setting a tone for the game.”
When Harvard has the ball, Baskind leads both her team and the league in points, assists, and shots, totaling 20, 8, and 46, respectively.
The senior, who has already tallied six scores, is three away from becoming fifth all-time for the Crimson in career goals.
“I’m really just trying to combine with my teammates and do what I can when I have the ball,” Baskind said. “I’m aiming to help out the team as much as I can and just continue to play our game.”
In a matchup featuring offensive prowess on both sides, energy is sure to be high. Despite rumors of bad blood between the teams, neither Harvard players nor coach would refer to this as a further incentive to come out firing.
“It’s just historic school rivalry,” Leone said. “That’s it. I respect them 100 percent, and hopefully, they feel the same about us.”
Tomorrow’s match will hold great importance, as the standings of the Ivy League are still completely up in the air. With three games left in the season, each match is crucial.
“I think that Princeton is going to be a really strong team,” Kanten said. “They will definitely have a lot of energy coming out against us. We just have to be prepared for the fights that we know they are going to bring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any good rivalry game needs to be a contest. You want it to be a fair fight, a matchup that either team could win in any given year regardless of its record coming in or the way it’s played so far.
There’s a reason we don’t see Michigan play a D-III team for its rivalry game. No one wants to see Michael Jackson and Carlton Banks from “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” compete in a dance-off. It would be totally lopsided, like watching 2000 Tiger Woods play golf against 2011 Tiger Woods.
Sure, there are a few exceptions. Die-hard college football fans call Notre Dame-Navy a rivalry even though the Midshipmen basically got handled every time until very recently. Chipotle always beats Qdoba in every measurable burrito metric, but we still like to compare them side-by-side.
But generally, that’s uninteresting.
In the Ivy League, an eight-team conference, each squad is a foe of the other seven. This week especially, it features some of the league’s longest-running games, including a few that date back to the 19th century.
Some of these games feature two teams with strong records, and we can expect a contest.
In others, you just have to ask: why are these rivalry games again?
Harvard faces off against Princeton, but this head-to-head matchup that dates back to 1877 hasn’t been much of a contest since the Clinton administration. The Crimson has only lost to the Tigers twice since 1996.
Don’t count on that changing too much this year. Harvard sits on a 4-1 record at the halfway point of the season. Princeton also has a win this year, beating Columbia, which is a little bit like saying that the DMV beat the TSA in a customer service evaluation.
There are still some compelling games to be played on Saturday. Yale faces Penn, and the two, along with Harvard and perhaps Brown, are the clear title contenders this season.
But the rest of the games may not be too tight. Even the Columbia-Dartmouth matchup, one that features two struggling teams, shouldn’t be much of a contest, despite their similar records.
Of course, by establishing that this week’s games are clear-cut, I set myself up for embarrassment when I inevitably butcher a few picks.
YALE (3-2, 2-0 Ivy) at PENN (3-2, 2-0)
In a week that looks filled with mismatches, this will clearly be the best Ivy League game. It’s the only matchup in the Ancient Eight that features two winning teams.
Though Yale is still undefeated in league play, its loss last week to Lafayette shows that the Bulldogs are definitely vulnerable. When Harvard played the Leopards three weeks ago, Lafayette looked entirely listless and was held to just three points.
It was totally lopsided, which is why I was so surprised by Yale’s loss. Either Lafayette figured something out—doubtful, based on what I saw in Easton, Pa.—or the Bulldogs have some kinks that they will need to have worked out if they want to beat Penn.
For one, Yale had two interceptions and ran for just 91 yards. Even so, the team kept it close with the Leopards into the fourth quarter, and at one point cut the lead to two before Lafayette pulled away.
Likewise, the Quakers’ 2-0 league record hardly tells the whole story. It managed its first win a few weeks ago at Dartmouth on a last-second touchdown.
But more surprisingly, Penn really had its hands full with the Lions, and it took another final-minute touchdown to cap a 14-point fourth-quarter comeback win. Part of the problem for the Quakers were fumbles—five of them, to be precise, two of which they lost.
This may be the best game on the league slate, but both teams have a lot of holes they need to close—fast.
Pick: Penn 21, Yale 20
BROWN (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) at CORNELL (2-3, 0-2)
Cornell continues to demonstrate that it’s a talented team, but it is having trouble getting over the hump.
Two weeks ago, it led Harvard in the second half before an onslaught of Crimson touchdowns pulled Harvard ahead for good.
Last week against Colgate, the Big Red mounted a miraculous comeback, scoring 10 points in the final two minutes to force overtime in the fourth quarter. But even then, Cornell couldn’t pull out a win, losing by a touchdown in extra time.
This game features two of the best quarterbacks in the Ivy League: the Big Red’s Jeff Mathews and Brown’s Kyle Newhall-Caballero.
Since a loss to Harvard in the second week of the Ivy season, Brown has looked better and better in every game that it has played, culminating in last week’s 34-0 win over Princeton.
Cornell has shown that it can compete with anyone in the league, though Brown might still be too good. It wouldn’t surprise me to see the Big Red come close once again, but I still expect Cornell to fall short.
Pick: Brown 35, Cornell 28
COLUMBIA (0-5, 0-2 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (1-4, 0-2)
This may look like a matchup of Ivy League doormats, but that doesn’t tell the whole story.
Compare, for instance, “Cars 2” and “Bucky Larson,” two box-office flops that came out this year. Although “Cars 2” did not earn much love from the critics and it’s probably still Pixar’s worst film, it wasn’t half-bad. Certainly entertaining, if goofy, and it definitely has its moments.
Then you have “Bucky Larson,” a movie I didn’t see because it looked so awful in the previews. You know how some movies fall into the so-bad-it’s-good category? Apparently this film was way, way past that point.
Dartmouth is “Cars 2”—some weaknesses for sure, but some highlights as well.
And Columbia? Falls a little bit more on the “Bucky Larson” end of things.
Actually, the Lions are coming off a game in which it contended against Penn, but Columbia couldn’t hold on in the end. And I think that the closeness of that one had more to do with serious Quaker weaknesses and lackluster performance in the first three quarters than any strengths that Columbia might have.
Penn has made a habit of pulling off those wins like that. And the Lions just haven’t shown much promise yet.
Dartmouth was clearly better last week than it was the week before when the Big Green was shut out by Yale, but its defense needs work. It surrendered 426 total yards to Holy Cross quarterback Ryan Taggart—and that’s tough to overcome.
Pick: Dartmouth 24, Columbia 17
PRINCETON (1-4, 1-1) at HARVARD (4-1, 2-0)
I’m not sure whether he’s eating his spinach or his Wheaties. Maybe he’s been watching inspirational sports movies back-to-back that are giving him that extra drive.
Whatever junior quarterback Colton Chapple is doing, it’s been working. His last two games have been nothing short of extraordinary.
In addition to being the first Harvard quarterback to throw four touchdowns in consecutive games, he’s just the second to throw for five TDs in a contest. The last time a Harvard passer did that, neither Hawaii nor Alaska was a state.
And that’s not all. He threw five in just over two quarters before he was taken out. Had he played the whole game, I honestly believe he could have thrown eight touchdowns.
If Chapple plays like he has in the last two weeks against Cornell and Bucknell, I don’t think Princeton has a shot.
Pick: Harvard 38, Princeton 13
RECORD LAST WEEK: 4-2 (To date: 12-6)

If you thought your friends were impressed by the fact that you got into Harvard with its 6.2% acceptance rate in 2011, it's time to think again. As more and more students worldwide seek tertiary education, some students are fighting against even more incredible odds worldwide to attend their top schools—and in some cases, Harvard's admissions rate looks positively gigantic. This year, some 485,000 students competed for just 10,000 spots at India's prestigious Institutes of Technology (IITs). For the mathematically challenged among us, 10,000 divided by 485,262 yields an admissions rate of just 2%.And the number of applicants keeps growing, having increased by some 30,000 since 2010. Competition has become so fierce that some reports suggest that 95% of successful applicants went through exam-coaching, with some taking anywhere from 2 to 4 years off of school to prepare. And with coaching costing anywhere from $800 to $3000 in a country where the average yearly income is just $3400, concerns about what IIT's extreme selectivity means for the poor are common.
For students from India at Harvard, the pressures of getting into an Indian higher education institution were often daunting. Namrata Narain '15 had thought of applying to American universities as a "second option" and spent the last two years of High School preparing for the IIT exam—only to find out she got into Harvard two days before taking the exam. Despite Narain’s clear academic qualifications, she guesses that even she would not have been admitted to India's prestigious Delhi University, where admission is determined solely by exam result.
Ultimately, it may come down to a simple problem of supply and demand. Shambhavi Singh '12 noted that there are just "not enough colleges in India that are considered top-tier and prestigious" to keep up with India’s booming population. Rishav Mukherji '15 agrees, noting that the strict entrance-exam based system is a large cause of brain drain as Indian students search for opportunities overseas.
For Mukherji, actually beginning to study for the exams made him realize that they weren’t for him, even though he had "always dreamed of the IITs." When he found out he would have to quit all his extracurricular activities just to prepare, he decided not to apply to a single Indian university. Anchal Lochan '13 concurs, noting that in contrast to the Indian exam system, the American educational system allowed her to "actually sit and think."

In this series, we'll be visiting the other parts of Cambridge, the "City of Squares." Join us as we explore the ins-and-outs of things to do in Inman, Central, Davis, Kendall, and Porter Squares.
 
Former home of Cambridge natives Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, Central Square is just a short T-stop away from Harvard and hosts a variety of shops, eateries, and bars, along with a vibrant music scene. Students looking for a break from the usual weekend routine should check out a few of the places Central Square has to offer.
 
Music
 
Since its first rock show in 1987, The Middle East has become one of the most popular music venues in the greater Boston area. Each night, The Middle East features indie and alternative rock groups in both its upstairs and downstairs rooms, as well as live music at its two restuarants, Zuzu and the Corner.
 
Around the corner is T.T. the Bear's Place, where according to local legend, a relatively unknown band named Nirvana once played to an audience of only 13 people. A hot spot for the younger crowd, the small, gritty dive has been booking a talented and eclectic mix of acts since 1985.
Additionally, The Cantab Lounge offers Bluegrass Tuesdays and Poetry slams, while Plough and Stars features live nightly local music in addition to their Southern cuisine.
 
Eats
 
Mingle with MIT students at The Miracle of Science Bar and Grill. Nothing quite says geek-chic like ordering off the Periodic Table and chowing down on a hamburger at lab counters turned restaurant tables.
For dessert, head to Toscanini's hailed by The New York Times as home of "the best ice cream in the world." For skeptics, Toscanini's rotation of 40-odd flavors—ranging from Chocolate Chip to Bourbon Black Pepper—offers ample opportunity to test the theory.
A popular spot for weekend clubbers, Moody’s Falafel Palace serves cheap eats until 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday but is delicious any day of the week—just ask Ben Affleck, who signed a t-shirt on the wall that proclaims, "Best Falafel in Town."
 
Shops
 
Rodney's Bookstore is home to more than 6,000 square feet of used books, rare books, and bargain books. In addition to more than 45,000 titles, Rodney’s also sells a wide variety of vintage poster prints.
Knick-knacks and novelty items abound at Buckaroo's Mercantile, where owner Brooks Morris makes nearly half of all the items available for purchase.
For your music needs, Central Square offers Cheapo Records—a store jam-packed with records, CDs, and tapes covering a range of genres—and Weirdo Records—the self-proclaimed "best in screwy music" and home of more obscure selections. Together, the two stores serve vinyl needs of nearly every variety.
 
Bars
Who can resist a place named after Charo's famous catchphrase? Cuchi Cuchi hosts an extensive menu of vintage and hand-muddled cocktails. The atmosphere, inspired by 1920s and 40s glamor, is perfect for sipping on a signature Blackberry Cosmo in your dress-code appropriate pearls and designer jeans.
Painted on the side of the People's Republik is a picture that proclaims, "Join The Party!" Fortunately, people of all political ideologies are free to enjoy drinks, darts, and what may be Cambridge's largest concentration of Communist propaganda at this friendly bar.
