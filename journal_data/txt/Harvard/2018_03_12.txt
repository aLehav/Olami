After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A beam of white light cut through the darkness of Boston’s Royale Nightclub on Feb. 26, ethereally illuminating Kelela’s silhouette. Clad in a white crop top and flowing, high-waisted pants, the singer’s crooning of the opening notes to the song “LMK” could just barely be heard above the screams in response to her mystical materialization onstage. In just seconds, the electronic R&B songstress transformed the venue’s unadorned, black stage into a deeply intimate musical spectacle. The combination of her candid presence and command of the stage made the Boston stop of her “Take Me Apart” tour feel particularly unique, almost like the audience was being let in on a secret.
Kelela’s entrance followed an impressive opening set from R&B singer-songwriter-producer Tiffany Gouché. The charismatic, California-born performer played impressive new singles “Dive” and “Down,” as well as favorites from her 2015 EP “Pillow Talk.” Gouché’s musical style calls to mind singer Lauryn Hill, so it came as no surprise when she brought the house together for a sing-along of “Killing Me Softly,” the cherry on top of a smooth and captivating performance.
Kelela, in body and voice, is the conductor of an electronic orchestra of one. She commands the lights, sound, and back-up singers with just the movement of her arms. Her performance mimics breathing, expanding at each chorus and contracting at each verse.  Nowhere could this be better observed than in the song “Blue Light,” from her debut studio album “Take Me Apart.” Bathed in a soft blue glow, Kelela stood still, save controlled movement of her arms. The background music and harmonies crescendoed in approach of the chorus, her arms outstretched in front of her, palms facing upward and rising. Delivering the final line of the verse, “I cop my keys and I’m out,” the singer pushed her arms to the sides and the single, blue spotlight exploded with the beat of the chorus into beams of white light probing the stage like searchlights. The singer pulled her arms to her body and the effects and sound followed, returning to the quiet blue spotlight of the verse.
“Take Me Apart” is an invitation into Kelela’s personal life, a topic she does not shy away from live. Not every song came with an introduction, but those that did displayed the singer’s conversational nature. “I wanted to let him know that I knew he was bullshit,” she mused about an ex as she introduced the song “Bluff,” provoking an eruption of laughter and cheering. She added, “I wanted to let him know that I was still fuckin’ with him anyway–and that I still had his back. As we do.” At one point she swept the prismatic, crystal beads at the ends of her hair over her shoulder, the sound prompting cheers of admiration from the audience. “I love y’all,” she laughed, shaking her hair in front of the mic to amplify the sound.
She combined nearly every song on “Take Me Apart” with a few tracks from previous works, creating a setlist of new and old that stylistically split the show in half. The opening half featured celestial, melodic arrangements of songs like “Blue Light” and “Better,” their mellow tones washing over the room one after another like waves. “Remember I told you that we would be closer,” she hummed in her captivating head voice in “Better,” “if we took some time further apart.” Soft orange light complimented the harmonies of the melancholy tune. The vibe of the performance, however, took a turn at the halfway point: “Let’s get lit,” Kelela announced. The arrangements picked up in speed and intensity, most notably for songs “Take Me Apart” and “A Message.” Her final number, before a brief encore, transcended all the rest. In a breathtaking rendition of “Altadena,” Kelela let loose a string of powerful vocal riffs all underscored by the beautiful, repeated lines, “Nothing to be said or done, it’s not just me it’s everyone.” The lights warmed her face as the music faded out—a fond farewell to her confidants for the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
That old American romance following outlaws on the run was due for a queer rewrite. It was, to borrow from Allen Ginsberg, in need of someone “putting [their] queer shoulder to the wheel.” It is a pleasure that Ezra Furman’s fourth solo album “Transangelic Exodus”—with its trans-genre mix of anthemic rock and roll, high theatrical camp, Jewish spirituality, and raw queer realism—does so so remarkably.
The album, which sounds like an amalgamation of Perfume Genius, “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” and late-career MCR, opens with the rollicking “Suck the Blood from My Wound,” which sets the scene with Furman singing about being on the run from the authorities with his fugitive trans-angelic lover. Over glistening pop-rock backing, Furman strikes a tone that’s both gloriously campy and affectingly serious, the over-the-top and the poignant running back-to-back in lines like: “Wrap half the money in your hospital garment / We'll stash the rest inside the red Camaro's secret compartment / Even the deepest wounds will heal over time / I'll run my fingers over your scars and yours over mine.” While the two are headed off to an at best uncertain future, the song remains defiantly optimistic. As Furman howls in the anthemic chorus, “I'm not about to sit here and watch as they / Suck the blood from my wound.” It insists on dignity, strength, and freedom in the face of persecution— that feels vital with rising homo- and trans-phobia.
Equally vital is the radical queer spirituality that Furman develops over the course of the album. In cello and bass number “God Lifts up the Lowly,” Furman evocatively reclaims the biblical image of God lifting up the bowed down for those marginalized due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. The song ends movingly, with Hebrew lines from the morning Jewish prayer service. While not all of the tracks are as reassuring (“God Lifts up the Lowly” is immediately succeeded by “No Place” which has Furman hauntedly declaring that “This whole world is no place / This world is no place at all.”) the album as a whole is similar in tone to Rabbi Nachman of Breslov’s famous line: “The whole world is a very narrow bridge; the important thing is not to be afraid.”  Or, in Furman’s parlance, the world may be no place at all, but he and his lover will still defiantly “drive…into the Great Unknown” as in the track of the same name that follows “No Place.”  Similarly, Furman concludes “Psalm 151”—the track which draws the on-the-road narrative to a close—with Nachman’s image of perseverance and radical hope in the face of struggle and potential despair: “Angel, I'll be your guardian if you'll be mine / Authorities are trailing right behind / I'm not afraid, we read the Psalms at night / Clear through Nebraska with just one headlight.”
The lovers on the run conceit stretches a little thin at times—so it comes as a relief when Furman shifts gears for a track or two from the highly fantastic imagery to something closer to raw realism. He proves a compelling narrator of his queer experience, in its sorrows and joys. On “Compulsive Liar,” he sings about the way in which the closet afflicts the spirit, warping the self—“It opens at a young age: / That all-protective closet…The longer you stay in there / The more you'll get distorted / The more contorted all your lies will have to be.” But the song ends on an overall hopeful note, with Furman offering an intimate exchange of secrets with his lover. The track is followed by the jagged, jangly “Maraschino Red Cherry Dress $8.99 at Goodwill,” in which Furman sings about the pleasures and the pains of being found in this object of desire. He concludes bitterly and then more bitter-sweetly—“Sometimes you go through hell and you / Never get to heaven…But I thank God / Who gives strength to the weary.”
Since so much of the album combines the bitter with the sweet, it’s a treat that Furman ends with a song brimming with hard-earned unabashed queer joy. “I Lost My Innocence” is certainly one of the more jubilant falls into experience set to record. Furman sings lines like “I lost my innocence to a / Boy named Vincent / Box of Girl Scout Thin Mints / And a pack of Winstons” over a loping, Pet Sounds-esque ditty. But this pleasure shouldn’t be mistaken for something frivolous, because for Furman the personal is radically political. As he concludes, he sings of this experience with Vincent:“In a single instance / I joined the true resistance…I was set free.” Amen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A pending lawsuit alleging Harvard’s admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans may go to trial as early as July, according to a Friday case filing.
The lawsuit, filed by the advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, is currently in the late stages of its discovery phase, with discovery and depositions scheduled for completion on May 1, 2018. The lawsuit alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
The new case filing suggests the trial date may begin in July or August, following the discovery period and subsequent court proceedings.
Though lawyers for SFFA wrote in the case filing they will request summary judgement—that is, a decision without a trial—they also wrote they believe this outcome is unlikely. The lawyers argue the expert reports do not appear to decisively favor either side.
“As the Court recognized at the February 7 hearing, this case is not likely to be resolved on summary judgment,” the case filing reads. “Four claims remain, and as to each, the parties have submitted expert reports that analyze identical data yet reach diametrically opposed conclusions.”
Edward Blum, president of SFFA, wrote in an emailed statement Saturday that the group “believes that the allegations we made about Harvard’s unconstitutional admissions policies will be evident to any impartial observer who reads our motion for summary judgement later this summer.”
If the United States District Court in Boston does not decide the case on summary judgement, the court will move to set a trial date. In the new filing, lawyers for SFFA wrote that they believe Harvard will request a trial date for the summer.
The organization itself, however, “requests that the Court maintain the existing schedule and either refrain from setting a trial date or set trial for at least two months after summary judgment briefing concludes.”
SFFA made an argument for a later trial date in the case filing, arguing they and their lawyers need more time for discovery and preparation “for a trial of this size and scope.” The organization’s lawyers wrote they believe a “full-blown” trial could take around four weeks to complete, though they requested a “narrowed” trial.
“The Court should not permit Harvard to leverage its resource advantage to SFFA’s detriment by rushing into trial on an expedited schedule,” the filing reads.
If the Court approves the plaintiffs’ request, the trial date may then be pushed further towards the end of 2018. Harvard, however, requested earlier in the case that the trial not be set for September through December because the admissions office is at its busiest during that time of year, reviewing thousands of applications.
The University argued it would unfairly burden admissions employees if they had to leave their work to give testimony during that time of year. If the Court approves both requests, the trial date may then be pushed back to 2019.
“If trial is not held this summer, it may be impossible to hold a trial in this case until the late spring or summer of 2019,” the case filing reads.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that many “highly academically qualified individuals” apply to the College.
“To deliver on our educational mission, our admissions practices consider the whole person, their capacity not only for academic excellence, but also their ability to contribute to and learn from people profoundly different from themselves,” Dane wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: March 14, 2018 at 6:27 a.m.
Some records stand for 10 years, others for hardly 10 hours.On Saturday afternoon at the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships, junior co-captain Gabby Thomas ran a 200-meter dash time that broke records of both categories. Crossing the finish line 22.38 seconds, Thomas claimed a national title, clocked an indoor national collegiate record, an Ivy League record, and a program record.The previous best time in the nation—22.40—stood for exactly a decade, originally inked into the record books by Bianca Knight, a Texas Longhorn turned Olympic athlete. The same Knight who donned a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympic games as a member of the US 4x100-meter relay team.Thomas also dropped the school and division records, though these had only been set the prior day—by Thomas. In the preliminary heats at the Texas A&M; Gilliam Indoor Track Stadium on Friday, the Florence, Mass., native sprinted a 22.66 second race to claim her spot in the final on Saturday. Thomas’ time represented the top preliminary mark of the meet, outpacing Georgia’s Lynna Irby by seven thousandths of a second.With the finals race separated into two heats, Thomas’ victory on Friday earned her the coveted fifth lane of the second heat, with the number one NCAA ranked Irby to her right in lane six.“Running in the second heat was a great advantage,” said Thomas in a post race interview with ESPN’s John Anderson. “You get to see what other people are running. You know what you’re up against, you know what you have to do. It was a great advantage.”In the first heat, senior Ashley Henderson of San Diego State set a facility record and just missed the collegiate best in a dash that clocked 22.41 seconds. Reaping the benefits of running in the second heat, Thomas knew as she lined up that she had to either beat, or get very close to beating, the collegiate record in order to leave Texas with a gold.
“I was thinking ‘I'm going to have to break a collegiate record if I want to win this race,’” Thomas said. “At that point all I could was take a risk and focus on my own race plan.”
So that’s what she did. Thomas jumped out to a quick lead and simply had to hold on to win her heat. As the quartet rounded the final stretch, Irby—a notoriously strong finisher—unhooked the trailer. Passing first LSU’s Kortnei Johnson, Georgia’s best gained on Thomas. However, the co-captain’s jump had been too great and Irby simply ran out of track.As Thomas slowed after the race, she threw a sideways glance at the clock. Seeing her time, the junior erupted into smiles.“Last year I came in dead last in this final with a really bad race,” said Thomas in the interview. “So I spent all year mentally preparing and focusing on the discipline and then I came out with the record. It’s amazing. It’s really amazing.”Thomas is the first Ivy League sprinter to qualify for the 200-meter dash final two years in a row and the fourth women’s national indoor champion to don Harvard’s crimson and white. The first women’s sprinter to accomplish the feat, she joins the ranks of high jumpers Kart Siilats (2001) and Dora Gyorffy (2000) in addition to Meredith Rainey (1990) in the 800-meter.
“It is an amazing feeling. Surreal,” Thomas said. “People don't see the hard work and sacrifices beforehand. So it's amazing to see it all pay off. And for the world to see that you can go to Harvard and do this. You can be an underdog and overcome.”
For the second consecutive season, Thomas also earned the USTFCCCA First Team All-America honors in the race—a first for the program and the Ancient Eight.
On Friday, Thomas ran in more than just the 200-meter. The Florence Flash placed 12th in the 60-meter dash after setting the Harvard and Ivy League record in the event at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships two weeks ago. This time, crossing the line in 7.26 seconds—.01 from her best—Thomas earned USTFCCCA Second Team All-America honors.
Thomas was not alone in College Station over the weekend. Men’s junior co-captain Myles Marshall earned a spot at the national meet in the 800-meter. Making his NCAA debut on Friday night, the junior also finished 12th in 1:48.58, a mere .41 seconds from a finals appearance. For his efforts Marshall earned USTFCCCA Second-Team All-American honors, the first member of the Harvard men’s team to do so since 2014.
