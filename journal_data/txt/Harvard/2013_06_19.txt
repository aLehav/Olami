After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Kanye West has always been, if nothing else, willing to share what is on his mind. Fortunately, for both himself and his fans, he is much more than that. Even West himself, with his deep sense of self-importance, cannot manage to overstate his importance to modern hip-hop. In a recent interview with the New York Times, West described his trendsetting power with the claim, “I am the nucleus.” From anyone else, these words would seem like comedic hyperbole, but West’s demeanor and indeed, his entire body of work are so drenched with his trademark unwavering self-confidence that his singular belief in himself seems right, even necessary. West has always been capable of channeling this charismatic intensity into his music, and his albums demand attention much the way the man himself does.
 
West’s last solo effort, the tremendous “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” is an album characterized by the lush, gorgeous production that has become almost synonymous with his name. It is a work of immediate beauty, easy to enjoy with its elegant strings and ethereal piano. It is West presenting himself to his audience on a magnificent platter of brilliant soundscapes, hoping for the approval of his fans and critics. His most recent release, “Yeezus,” is completely, violently, angrily different. As the name suggests, “Yeezus” is an unrepentant roar of self-affirmation that soars on West’s fervent belief in himself. Where “Fantasy” was the Rapture, “Yeezus” is the Day of Judgment. The album is Kanye at his finest, raw and unfettered, willing to lash out in every direction to make room for his own aggrandizement.
 
“Yeezus” opens with “On Sight,” immediately striking a different tone from every other Kanye release to date with sharp stabs of fuzzy synths that create a pointillist beat that would feel more at home in a German house club. It is far from a welcoming introduction. Instead, it feels more like a declaration of indifference to the listener’s sensibilities, and in fact, West challenges the listener outright in the bridge of the track, “How much do I not give a fuck? / Let me show you right now before you give it up.” This abruptly gives way to a brief interlude of a sample of the Holy Name of Mary Choral family singing “He’ll Give Us What We Really Need,” before West plunges back into the harsh environment of synths, courtesy of French robots, Daft Punk, who produced the track. In the very first song of the album, West maps the peaks and valleys of the ride to come, swerving from an assaultive house beat to a classically Kanye choir sample.
 
In the opening songs of the album, West builds a pounding momentum that he wields deftly to deliver the G.O.O.D. News of West. The first three tracks are utterly foreign territory for veteran West fans, with primal beats and a jagged roughness to the production. “Black Skinhead” leads with a barrage of deep drums and breathy panting, followed by a similarly relentless vocal onslaught from West, punctuated with shrill shrieks. The first half of “New Slaves” begins in a similar fashion, and just as it begins to feel as if West may have settled into the sound of the album, the outro begins. It is a jubilant moment of light shining through all the darkness that West has built up until this point. Strings sing out alongside Frank Ocean, as an “808s & Heartbreak”-era autotuned Kanye croons, “You cannot survive / And I’m not dying / And I can’t lose / I can’t lose.” 
 
One of Kanye’s greatest talents has always been his ear for samples and featured artists, and “Yeezus” is rife with pitch-perfect selections. “Blood On The Leaves” brings together samples from Nina Simone’s tragically beautiful rendition of “Strange Fruit” and the crushingly heavy “R U Ready” by the trap gods TNGHT, creating a gripping combination. The unlikely but fruitful artistic relationship between Kanye and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver which began when West sampled Bon Iver’s “Woods” for “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” continues on “Yeezus.” Three songs, “Hold My Liquor,”  “I’m In It,” and  “I Am A God,” benefit from Vernon providing haunting vocals to complement the darkness established through the album’s production. Beyond the novelty value of placing Chief Keef alongside Justin Vernon, West’s penchant for experimentation has always served as an important driving force in the continuing development of mainstream hip-hop.
 
“Yeezus” ends on a high note after West travels through an inferno and purgatory filled with the low thrum of bass and growl of distortion. “Bound 2” is a fantastic return to form, a triumphant reprise of the Kanye of old. The song is a gleeful ballad, dripping with soul using the charming samples, “Bound to fall in love” followed by a cute “Uh huh honey.” “Bound 2” is Kanye at his most romantic, and he delivers the line “One good girl is worth a thousand bitches,” with a sincerity that most R&B crooners can only aspire to.
 
This release is just that for West—an unrestrained release of raw emotion. The album’s production is not complex, but it is far from simple, as his handful of well chosen elements are all pushed to the maximum. West occupies a uniquely central position in popular culture, but he has never taken that as a reason to reproduce mainstream music. He has always doggedly pursued the music that he believes in most, and his latest album is fearless in his expression and ruthless in its execution. “Yeezus” is Kanye at his best, boldest, least commercial, and above all, most sincere. West’s truest believer is himself, and really, who can blame him?

ZAGREB, Croatia—Somewhere in Zagreb, there’s a warehouse stocked with monuments to heartache. Abandoned teddy bears—fur thick with dried tears—are propped up alongside old love letters. People from all over the world have mailed tokens of their lost loves here that they might be displayed—some make the cut, and others keep each other company in storage.
This is Zagreb’s Museum of Broken Relationships, founded by a divorced couple (post-divorce). According to a sign, the museum proclaims to offer “a chance to overcome an emotional collapse through creation.” Drinking a glass of Istrian wine in the adjoining café, I probably look like a donated testament to loneliness, myself.
Some displays are wryly comical—a white garter belt from Sarajevo hangs from a peg alongside the caption, “I never put them on. The relationship might have lasted longer if I had.” Even the Wi-Fi password in the adjoining café is called “losing game.” Amy Winehouse would be proud.
Other collections are devastating. A skeleton key from Ljubljana belonged to a woman whose soul mate refused to make love to her; it was only after they broke up that she found out it was because he had AIDS.
But visitors seeking entry into some consensus about love here will be disappointed. Half of the former owners of these locks of hair and shattered mirrors advise that we all call it quits, while the other half urge that we keep our faith in love.
It seems a bit like Santa Claus, really—it’s not essential that anyone see these things. I don’t believe that reading heartbreaking accounts of loss and cruelty will change how I deal with being hurt or infatuated. Love may be a losing game, but we play it because there is a small chance that we may win. And even if we do end up losing, we never get sick of telling the story.
Rather, what’s important about this place is that it exists at all—that there is a place for people to send these discarded bits of self.
A tattoo on the wall of the first gallery quotes Roland Barthes: “Every passion, ultimately, has its spectator...(there is) no amorous oblation without a final theater.” In the spirit of Barthes’ wisdom, curators encourage visitors to write in a guest book at the exit. Like visitors to the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem or the Casa di Giulietta in Verona, these pilgrims offer their reflections in a sort of ritual. Just as children delight in swapping battle scar tales, we love to bare our broken hearts to the world, even anonymously.
Call it egotism or sheer exhibitionism, but we rarely share biography to give the gift of catharsis or because its important. More often, it’s storytelling for its own sake.

IFAKARA, Tanzania - It’s a lazy Sunday afternoon in the small town of Ifakara. I’m 200 miles from the bustling hub of Dar es Salaam, my original internship site.  I'll be spending two weeks here. That wasn’t part of the plan, but little here is.
I’ve made plans to walk around town with Laura, an American entomologist, and Clara, a Ugandan medical researcher. My watch says it’s 3 p.m. Time to meet up, my mental iCal fires off. Let’s stick to the schedule.
The three of us set off in search of everything from fabric to rice to peanut butter. We couldn’t find these staples at the two rickety wooden produce stands inside our hospital compound. A 9-year-old boy, the son of the cook at Laura’s research site, joins our trio. My conversation with Laura sparks; surrounded by gentle sunlight and adventurous prospects, we don’t turn to check on the boy and Clara for a few minutes. When we do, they’re at least 30 paces behind.
Clara joins us at her leisure. “You Americans,” she gripes, shaking her dark head, her carefully coiffed hair streaked with magenta extensions. “Always in such a hurry, walking so fast. You need to walk like an African.”  Laura and I laugh her off, making excuses. We’ve got tall friends, we say. She’s from Washington, D.C.; I’m from Boston. We were born efficient. By American standards, we weren’t walking fast at all.
I’ve spent the past week in Ifakara waiting to work. With my supervisor sick for days on end, I’ve whiled away the hours with e-books, illegally streamed television, and drawn-out sighs. When I opened my email to discover I would have to reschedule my Kilimanjaro plans, I was red-faced in seconds. “Plans,” I mentally muttered. “Have – to – stick – to – plans!”
I’ve come to realize that I thrive on order; any number of piercings and tie-dyed shirts cannot mask my neurotic inflexibility. I’ve taken to stocking up on toilet paper here, always certain that we’re about to run out. I hang newly clean clothes on the line far before I’ve run out – what if it rains and they take two days to dry rather than one?
“You’re so independent,” everyone tells me: between a semester studying abroad in Kenya and a summer internship in Tanzania, I will be spending half of 2013 in East Africa. But I think my friend Sarah got it right: “You’re the most adventurous homebody I know.”
I yearn to see more of the world, and so far, so good. But every time I learn the virtue of flexibility while abroad, I miraculously discard it the second my plane’s wheels hit the Logan tarmac. I can’t say I’ll be any different come August, but for the next two months, I’ll try to walk like an African.

CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom—It’s four in the afternoon, and my housemate, Chris, is casually propelling his spoon around the rim of his bowl, watching as the last few cornflakes lazily twist and turn. I just arrived a couple of days ago, and he’s been describing the town to me in the terms by which he understands it: “Cambridge has the lowest number of redeemed welfare payments of all towns in England,” he says.
His eyes are lost in thought, as if he is envisioning the city as a whole in his mind’s eye—which would make sense, as Cambridge is a tiny place, and he is one of a very few students at Cambridge University who get a chance to complete a Masters degree in Land Economy, an intensive program designed around studying the economics and law of real estate and urban planning. He consumes another spoonful of cereal before adding, with a note of finality and authority, “It’s a nice place to be!”
My friend who showed me around the town on my first day described it as “homogeneous.” He’s right, but it’s homogeneous in a fairy-tale way that makes it all strangely enchanting. People bike everywhere, wearing gorgeous clothing all the while. Girls wear Peter Pan blouses with the occasional wooly sweater thrown on top, or white summer dresses, broderie anglaise waving dangerously in the breeze, as they wind through crowds of tourists between Magdalene and Starbucks or ride over the Mathematical Bridge of Queens’ College.
The wealth is obvious, but only in the outlandish way very old wealth is. As a medievalist friend studying for his PhD aptly described it, the city “is a collision between the advanced and the archaic.” The window in our house’s kitchen was broken long ago and remains permanently open, giving an array of miniscule wildlife a chance to thrive amongst the crevices of our stove and the cracks in our unsteady wooden table. None of the faucets in the bathroom work properly, and one day, the showerhead just fell down and broke.

Donald M. Berwick ’68, a lecturer on health care policy at Harvard Medical School, announced Monday that he will run for governor of Massachusetts in 2014.
The progressive Democrat and former Obama administration health care official revealed his plans in a press release posted on his website—a quiet campaign launch timed in part, he said in a phone interview Tuesday, to help rally support for his fellow Democrat, U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey. The longtime Malden congressman will face voters in a special election next Tuesday in his bid for the Commonwealth’s open Senate seat.
Though Berwick has never held elected office, he said he is “encouraged by the record and interest of Massachusetts voters in newcomers to politics like me.”
Berwick, who holds degrees from the Medical School and the Kennedy School, spent years as a celebrated advocate for health care reform while sitting on various advisory committees and councils. 
Yet his previous experience working in government has not been without controversy. In July 2010, President Obama appointed Berwick, then a longtime faculty member at the Medical School and the School of Public Health, as administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during recess, temporarily bypassing Senate approval. But as Berwick helped implement the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s landmark 2010 health care law, he came under fire from conservatives for his advocacy of redistribution of wealth in health care as well as his supposed support for health care rationing—a charge he has adamantly denied. With Senate Republicans vowing to block Berwick’s confirmation hearing, he resigned after nearly 17 months as chief and returned to Massachusetts. Over a year later, he embarked on a “listening tour” of the state to explore a possible gubernatorial run.
Berwick’s trajectory has been compared to that of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another liberal Harvard professor who ran for elected office in Massachusetts following a stint in Washington D.C.—a similarity that Berwick said he embraces.
“I’d be doing very well to emulate her,” Berwick said. “I think she and I are very much on the same page. I'm flattered by the comparison.”
As he looks ahead to his own gubernatorial campaign, Berwick is eyeing Warren’s successful Senate run as well as current governor Deval L. Patrick '78’s two gubernatorial campaigns. He said he hopes to use many of the same campaign strategies—including a grassroots approach and an aggressive use of the internet—that helped propel those two politicians to victory.
But Robert J. Blendon, a professor at the School of Public Health and a longtime close colleague of Berwick, said that despite the similarities between Berwick and Warren, he expects Berwick’s campaign to play out very differently than that of Warren. While Warren was able to draw from her past experience as a consumer advocate in Washington to run a Senate campaign focused often on national issues, Berwick faces an entirely different challenge with a gubernatorial campaign—familiarizing himself with a broad range of state-level issues ranging in topic from the fishing industry to charter schools.
“When you're a national figure and you come home to run for governor, you have to reach out to those groups of people that you may not have [previously] had the same involvement with,” Blendon said. “He is going to have to go from one of the world’s renowned people in health care to somebody who really can talk about the problems of day care in Massachusetts.”
Berwick, who last co-taught a Harvard class in spring 2010, the semester before he went to Washington, downplayed his role as an academic. He said that while he loves teaching, he sees himself primarily as an “activist.”
Still, Berwick admitted that he has been molded by Harvard. He named a litany of colleagues who have helped shape his views on policy and activism, including Blendon, Medical School professor Barbara J. McNeil, Arnold M. Epstein, a professor who sits on the faculty at the School of Public Health and the Medical School, and Joseph P. Newhouse '63, a health care policy professor who holds appointments at the School of Public Health, the Kennedy School, and the Medical School.
He acknowledged too that he may come under some of the same attacks that conservatives volleyed against Warren, who was cast as a sequestered Harvard elitist by her opponent former U.S. Senator Scott Brown.
But Blendon said that Berwick will be subject to even more complex scrutiny on the campaign trail in his quest to manage the Commonwealth.
"The issues he's going to face are not going to be just, 'Is he a Harvard professor, and what does he know?’ It's whether or not he could effectively manage a broad range of issues across the state,” Blendon said, adding that for a professor, Berwick has an unusually broad amount of managerial experience.
With his announcement Monday, Berwick became the second Democratic candidate—and the second health care expert with a Medical School degree—to enter the race. Joseph C. Avellone, a health care executive and former Wellesley, Mass. selectman, declared his candidacy for the governorship in January.

UPDATED: June 20, 2013, at 11:24 a.m.
The International Monetary Fund has announced that it will partner with edX to become the first body outside of higher education to offer courses through the online learning venture.
The IMF, an international governmental organization of 188 countries, has long offered courses in policy, finance, and economics to government officials in member nations at centers across the world. It plans to broaden its reach by providing instruction on these same topics to a wider audience through collaboration with edX, the free, nonprofit virtual education platform launched by Harvard and MIT last year. Twenty-five other colleges and universities have since joined the platform.
“This collaboration with the IMF demonstrates another innovative use of the edX platform,” edX president Anant Agarwal said in a press release dated Wednesday announcing the partnership. “It is a natural progression for us to work with a variety of other institutions seeking a flexible, feature-rich and massively-scalable platform to deliver their own educational programs.”
The IMF will pilot two online courses—“Financial Programming and Policies” and “Debt Sustainability Analysis”—that will be made available to groups of government officials in the months ahead and released to the public in 2014.
“We are delighted to join with edX in this new initiative, which will allow us to respond to the demands for more training from our member countries,” Sharmini A. Coorey ’80, director of the Institute for Capacity Development at the IMF, said in the press release. “We look forward to being able to offer online access to a broader audience through future massive open online courses.”
Following the announcement, several Harvard faculty members said expanding economic training programming through edX could serve to benefit people around the world.
Eric D. Werker, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who has researched emerging economies, wrote in an email that “all education has some element of public good to it.”
“When the target audience [of education] is policymakers in countries in poor countries, the public good element can be even stronger, since—at least in theory—they are there to create the regulatory scaffolding for citizens to improve their prosperity,” Werker wrote. “It makes sense to have this content be as widely available as possible, to make government itself more competitive and to give citizens the tools to engage with their governments.”
Michael Woolcock, a lecturer on public policy at the Kennedy School, said that organizations like the IMF that offer training programs as part of their business model can be constrained by distance and cost. Partnerships like the one with edX, he suggested, can help alleviate those constraints.
Woolcock, who is also lead social development specialist with the World Bank’s Development Research Group, said the online platform could be a “low-cost, high-access way of engaging with really routine and entry-level kinds of issues for some people, but around which there's a big payoff to having a broad base of understanding” of what he termed “core technical issues in development.”
“I imagine that’s the main imperative driving these kinds of partnerships,” he said.
