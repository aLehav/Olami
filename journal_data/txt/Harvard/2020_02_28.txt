In the vein of other female-authored mystery thrillers like “Gone Girl” or “The Girl on a Train,” Tanen Jones’ debut novel “The Better Liar” focuses on a troubled, suburban wife searching for answers. Though thrillers have long since exhausted the trope of a housewife on the verge of a nervous breakdown, this latest novel seeks to bring more depth to the genre by sensitively exploring stigmatized issues regarding mental health and depression. Jones uses her carefully crafted narrators to bring her characters alive in an enthralling new mystery.
Accountant Leslie Voigt Flore anchors the novel. She lives with her husband Dave and young son Eli in Albuquerque, and she has been desperately trying to track down her younger sister, Robin Voigt, to no avail. This is not surprising considering that Robin, the family’s wild child, ran away from home ten years ago at the tender age of 16.
Though the two shared a strained relationship, Leslie embarks on this mission in order to collect a large sum from her father’s estate. Under the terms of his will, both siblings must be present in order for them to receive their inheritance — a clause introduced in the hopes of making the two women reconnect. While following a lead in Nevada, Leslie comes upon Mary, a waitress and wannabe-actress with an uncanny resemblance to her missing sister. Mary agrees to return to New Mexico with Leslie and pose as Robin so the two can con their way into collecting the Voigt inheritance. Events become more complicated when Robin’s dead body is found at her apartment in Las Vegas.
The narration shifts between the point of views of the three women — Leslie, Mary, and Robin — moving through their different perspectives and time shifts almost imperceptibly. Jones is an adept writer who imbues each woman with her own voice and carefully crafted desires: She makes a real effort at creating women of complexity who are both vulnerable and worthy of empathy.
From the start, the book ruminates on what it means to be a young woman who perishes in unseemly circumstances. In the prologue, a deceased Robin suggests that it is only the ones who really loved you who can keep your memory alive: “I mean the ones who saw your disgusting insides and loved you anyway … I only had one person like that. Leslie, my sister.”
Robin’s voice is particularly noteworthy given that she narrates with an unhinged candor and grit that veers towards uncomfortable truths. She remarks that she left home with an earnest desire to escape her family: “I was sixteen and so beautiful that taking my body into the world was like ferrying around a stolen luxury car: just the having of it implied action.” Her self-recognition suggests unsavory truths of what it means to grow up too quickly as a beautiful girl in the American southwest.
Jones writes best when focusing on the characterizations of these women. For example, by diving into Leslie’s complicated relationship with her mentally ill mother, Jones simultaneously unpacks Leslie’s unstable relationship with Eli. Jones’ depiction of Leslie’s marriage to Dave, likewise, is handled carefully. She avoids the trope of overwrought psychoanalytic thinking in favor of a more profound exploration. The ultimate reasons for their troubles aren't revealed until the end, and until then Jones does an excellent job of leaving red herrings along the way.
At times, it can be difficult to grasp some of the characters’ motivations. Jones portrays each character thoroughly, such that it becomes difficult to unsee Leslie or Mary in the way they were originally presented. For example, Mary’s willingness to help Leslie appears almost incompatible with how quickly she is willing to suspect Leslie’s intentions and begin investigating them. Though this incongruity is explained in the ending, the feeling of unharmoniousness is hard to shake.
Ultimately this imbalance has less to do with the characters than with the plot itself. Jones carefully leaves a trail of breadcrumbs along the way, but when all the pieces come together they are rather inconclusive.
That said, the numerous twists — and I do mean numerous — unspool beautifully and shockingly. The resulting novel is absolutely gripping. Jones knows exactly when to drop background information to carefully build up the reader’s expectations in a certain way. In her hands, suspense is not merely a byproduct of the novel, but a dominant force. Her plot is carefully organized such that the suspense never stops building.
Surprisingly, Jones succeeds in creating a mystery that is poignant, a feat owed to the themes revolving around it rather than just the puzzle itself. By the end, her characterization makes us wonder if we have ever really known anyone properly. As Robin remarks rather darkly towards the end of the novel: “The more you know someone, the more someones you know. They kaleidoscope outward before your eyes.” As readers of “The Better Liar” will find out, Robin's words turn out to be painfully true.

Hulu’s new series “High Fidelity” is the latest adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel of the same name, which, since its 1995 publication, has inspired a film starring John Cusack in 2000 and a Broadway musical in 2006. This latest interpretation, a series of 10 half-hour episodes, is a revitalizing gender-swapped version of the story. It stars Zoë Kravitz as Rob, the self-absorbed yet likable owner of a Brooklyn record shop called Championship Vinyl, where the only other employees are her two best friends, Simon (David H. Holmes) and Cherise (Da’vine Joy Randolph). Feeling introspective after another failed relationship — her recent breakup with boyfriend Russell “Mac” McCormack (Kingsley Ben-Adir) is particularly jarring — Rob is moved to contact everyone from her top five heartbreak list to find out why she’s so unlucky with love. While honoring the uniquely original premise of its source material, “High Fidelity” is a candid and modern rendition fit for 2020, complete with an evocative soundtrack — ranging from Fleetwood Mac to Prince to Frank Ocean — that underscores the timeless story of painful heartbreak and emotional maturation.
Rob is almost presented as an antihero to viewers. She has a penchant for abandoning dates by sneaking out of a restaurant mid-meal, and she tends to tune out her friends in conversations, forever preoccupied with her own issues. She’s often cold to the incessantly sweet Clyde, the new-in-town “nice guy” played by Jake Lacy. He’s obviously been typecast for the role, but who’s complaining? In a rather tender moment, straight-laced Clyde even steals a rare original pressing of a David Bowie record for her. For all her imperfections, however, Rob is still an everywoman, as Kravitz brings even more likability to the character than John Cusack before her. Zoë Kravitz is a magnetic and natural actress; perhaps she’s inherited some on-screen talent from parents Lenny Kravitz and Lisa Bonet (who, coincidentally, starred in the original film opposite Cusack), but she brings a down-to-earth coolness to the role that is definitively her own. She’s effortlessly relatable, perhaps not in spite of, but because of her own status as a 29-year-old with plenty of growing up to do.
By the end of episode four, Rob is already done confronting everyone on her heartbreak list, from the hilariously pseudo-intellectual Kat Monroe (Ivanna Sakhno) to seventh grade “boyfriend” Kevin Bannister (Clark Furlong). This leaves the series with ample time to follow Rob and her friends Simon and Cherise in their adventures across New York City, even as she continues to obsess over ex-boyfriend Mac, who’s just moved back to town with his new fiancée.
Rob wouldn’t be Rob without the updated versions of Championship Vinyl’s two dedicated employees, both of whom were originally white guys named Dick and Barry. Simon, number three on Rob’s top five heartbreak list, dated Rob until she caught him giving his number to a man at the laundromat (“I guess I’m gay,” he confesses to her in a flashback). Despite their messy breakup, Rob and Simon remain close friends because of their mutual love of music, and their endearing bond is made believable by the actors’ easy chemistry. Simon is a fully realized character who even gets an entire episode dedicated to his own Top Five heartbreak list, a quick but enjoyable divergence from Rob’s emotional turmoil. Cherise, another gender-swapped character, is played by the electric Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who puts the comedy in the show’s categorization of romantic-comedy. Randolph dishes out pithy one-liners with her hilarious mannerisms as a loyal and opinionated aspiring musician who doesn't seem to actually make music. Her character is infectiously effervescent, especially when she dances in the record shop to “Come on Eileen” by Dexys Midnight Runners.
With diversity clearly a priority in the casting and writing of the series, 2020’s “High Fidelity” is truly an adaptation for the current age. Even the arguments between the trio at Championship Vinyl have been smartly updated for the new decade. “This person who’s clearly never been on the Internet is trying to buy a Michael Jackson album for her boyfriend,” Cherise tells Rob with contempt as she tries to refuse the customer the record. Other modern touches include Rob impulsively texting a Spotify playlist to her ex and stalking his fiancée’s Instagram, humorously capturing the frustrating reality of breakups in the era of social media.
“High Fidelity” is a breezy watch, somehow lighthearted and funny while still maintaining the depth that makes it a story worth retelling in so many forms. Perhaps the most satisfying aspect of the show is Rob’s character development — she’s been selfish, and she knows it. Kravitz easily brings her dynamic character to life as she grows into a more self-aware and considerate person, showing refreshing accountability worth even more than the original pressing of a David Bowie record.

“It isn’t just that we live in a patriarchy. It’s that the patriarchy lives in us.”
Witty, thought-provoking quotes from Gloria Steinem such as these abound throughout the inspiring theatrical biography that is “ Gloria: A Life,” playing through March 1 at the American Repertory Theatre. The show, an original off-Broadway production written by Emily Mann, premiered in New York in 2018. As shocking and elegant as Steinem herself, the show is a beautiful tribute to a trailblazing activist and the women’s movement to which she has been and always will be integral.
The performance space is arranged so that audience members sit in a circle face to face, evoking the experience of late-night chats around a campfire. This, as it is explained, is meant to simulate natural human interaction. The set is homey and inviting, with rugs covering the floor, pillows across the seats, and floor cushions for audience members. Everything is in warm tones of red and yellow. A white projector screen composed of tiles hangs on either side of the room, on which a montage including footage from the Seneca Falls Convention and Steinem’s life plays. The video ends with a shot of her standing, hand in the air. Then the lights go up to reveal Patricia Kalember as Steinem, holding the same pose.
The show paints a picture of Gloria Steinem’s life in the public sphere as a journalist and a feminist political activist alongside her personal life story, “together, like a braid,” as Mann explains. Steinem shares her famous Playboy bunny story before transitioning into her experience with abortion. Stories about her mother are woven into the narrative of her feminist activism. Raw, real, and vulnerable, “Gloria: A Life” is a history of the women’s movement from the perspective of one of its greatest advocates.

An all-female ensemble accompanies Kalember, helping her act out Steinem’s story and contributing their own voices. They fill out the story and the space, often scattering into the audience to speak from among the people. The result is a harmony with Steinem’s story of the women’s movement: This was, and is, a collective undertaking.
This sense of a collective is hammered home by a talking circle after the show, an open discussion with the audience meant to foster reflection and dialogue about “the play, the women’s movement, and the ongoing struggle for equality in our world today.” The conversation is launched by a special guest at each show. Guests include Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts CEO Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, founder of Radical Black Girl Destiny Polk, and Nancy Gibbs, the first female Editor-in-Chief of TIME magazine, to name a few. The mic is then handed to any audience member who raises their hand to signal that they want to share their thoughts.
The first speaker at the Feb. 16 show underscored the reality of the stories presented in the play by courageously sharing her own abortion story. The next speaker shared her experience at the March for Our Lives and her hopes for a better world for her daughter. Most of the people who spoke were older women, people who grew up with Gloria Steinem, who experienced the feminist movement as she drove it. For me, as a young woman, listening to these women speak was eye-opening: All my life I have taken for granted the opportunities that have been given to me by these women, who fought and paved the way so that I could have this world, though still imperfect, in which to continue the fight.
“Gloria: A Life” not only tells an important and inspirational story but teaches us to listen to those around us. The show is about one woman, but it also shines a spotlight on the women in her life who helped her along the way, from activists like Dorothy Pitman Hughes and Florynce Kennedy to Steinem’s own mother. As Steinem notes in the play, “like a lot of women, I am living my mother’s unlived life.”
Gloria Steinem’s story is far from over. At 85 years old, Steinem is still engaged and active in the political sphere, making the world a better place. At the show’s conclusion, the actors leave the audience with a request: to go out and do something radical in the next 24 hours. We might not all be Gloria Steinem, but as your first radical act, you can go see this show and be inspired to make a difference.

Where could Tame Impala go after achieving the rare synthesis of indie appreciation and mainstream success following their 2015 album “Currents”? There is a wide spectrum of possibility for the follow-up to a big hit in today’s fractured, ultra-competitive music climate. On one end, artists can reinvent themselves completely and suffer financially for it. The public wanted Arctic Monkeys to release another “AM,” but frontman Alex Turner instead gave them the Bowie-esque “Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino,” a concept album about a moon resort with good tacos. Conversely, artists can put up a facade of change that is broadly palatable but lacks personality or purpose. Justin Bieber’s “Changes” carries big messages of transformation but fails to take artistic risks. This dilemma — forgoing commercial success for niche left turns versus talking about musical evolution without actually delivering the goods — belies an inescapable truth of art: Change is hard.
“The Slow Rush,” released on Feb. 14 as the culmination of a grueling five-year wait after “Currents,” refuses to fall neatly into either of the aforementioned archetypes. Instead, frontman Kevin Parker offers a balance between sonic 180 degree pivots and false promises. Is this balance satisfying? To many, it won’t be. While the group’s sound largely remains the same, the lyrical content and opaque song structures point to a substantial — and potentially off-putting — maturation from Parker. But Parker finally seems to feel satisfied with his work, which has allowed him to take calculated risks on this album that pay off handsomely on repeat listens.
Oftentimes, the follow-up to a big record emerges out of isolation. Turner and Bieber largely left the spotlight during their five-year release droughts — “Despacito” notwithstanding — and their subsequent lyrics speak of struggles with writer’s block and imposter syndrome. Parker stayed active during this break, though, producing for artists like SZA and playing bass for Travis Scott on “SNL” in 2018. As a result, the change that inspires “The Slow Rush” is paradoxical: We do different things only to end up exactly where we started.
This inherent circularity informs the thematic arc of “The Slow Rush.” At the album’s onset, life passes Parker by (“We’re on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop” on “One More Year”). Marriage breaks this hypnosis on “Instant Destiny” (“Let’s cause something permanent / Just so we know we can”), leading Parker to reckon with his social life on “Borderline” (“I wonder how I managed to end up in this place”) and family ties on “Posthumous Forgiveness” (“You’re just a man after all”). This reckoning isn’t easy, spurring the anxiety-reducing techniques of “Breathe Deeper,” the forward-focus of “Tomorrow’s Dust,” and the steadfast optimism of “On Track.” This personal focus requires letting go of nostalgia (“Lost in Yesterday”), questioning permanence (“And I tell her I’m in love with her / But how can I know that I’ll always be?” on “Is It True”), and coming to terms with mortality (“It Might Be Time”). The two minute long “Glimmer” shows Parker returning to the studio and serves as an interlude to the frighteningly beautiful “One More Hour,” with its outro speaking to Parker’s acceptance and ownership over his decisions (“I’m with you and I can roll into another year”).
Grand themes are not new for Tame Impala. “Currents” produced hits like “The Less I Know The Better” and “Let It Happen” while still connecting songs through the motif of moving on. Some tracks, however, felt inessential to this narrative, and their ordering actively hampered its impact. Parker admits his evolution on “Yes I’m Changing,” and emotionally breaks off a relationship in “Eventually,” but he then reverts to pining after a flame in “The Less I Know The Better,” breaking his progress. “The Slow Rush,” in contrast, seems more emotionally consistent.
“The Slow Rush” also takes after the more complex aspects of “Currents.” “New Person, Same Old Mistakes” finished “Currents” on a multilayered high note, and Parker takes some of that unorthodox structure into his next album. “Breathe Deeper” samples, in Parker’s words, a track from a “parallel universe.” “Posthumous Forgiveness” displays over two acts Parker’s progression from hating his father to sympathizing with him. Parker samples a phone call with his wife on “Tomorrow’s Dust” and an unnamed podcast on “Glimmer.” Even “Borderline,” which was released as a single in 2019, sounds entirely different on the album: the bass is heightened, the drums hit harder, and the synths are much funkier. Some of these decisions may not work for everyone — the fake-outs in “It Might Be Time” and “Glimmer,” for example, can feel superfluous — but this record is much riskier and experimental than it first appears. The vast majority of these leaps work, though, because of the agonizingly long wait between albums, time that has given Parker the chance to not just obsess over artistic dilemmas but also expand his range.
In all likelihood, most listeners will not give this record the time it needs to fully sink in. That’s not anyone’s fault, since the music market has gotten more crowded, even in the five years since “Currents.” While there are undeniable hooks on this album that will stick in your memory, there doesn’t appear to be a hit on the same level as “The Less I Know The Better.” Lacking popularity works for Parker, though, because he doesn’t intend to play it safe in search of radio success like Bieber. Alternatively, the goal of the album was also not to fundamentally change his band’s sound, as Turner did for Arctic Monkeys. Instead, by not following either example, Parker has carved himself his own spot on the spectrum of follow-ups: one that actively, naturally improves upon its predecessor, and one that other artists would do well to emulate. In the end, “The Slow Rush” is a record about focus — which, unfortunately, is required to fully imbibe what Parker has to offer.

His fingers are graphite-smudged from lecture notes, but they’re practiced when they fold the cheese in wax paper and ring me up. Seven dollars, he says.
Was this your first choice for a job?
He shrugs. Didn’t really have a first choice, he says. Money’s money. He sticks the rest of the cheese back into its refrigerated case, where it’s crammed next to blocks of every lumpy shape and color — but not before he snips off a slice for himself and savors it. Rosemary manchego, he says. You don’t get shit like that in the dining hall.
It’s true, I think. I’ve got an ear for that sort of thing. But I also think he’s not telling the whole truth. So I wait.
Not like there weren’t other options, he says at last. My roommate said he’d recommend me for an administrative role in something Harvard-affiliated. God only knows how he’s gotten that already. Maybe he knew someone on staff? Accosted someone at the end of a class or a workshop? How do people get jobs that fast in the real world?
I wait again.
Would have looked great on a resume, he says, idly rearranging jars of fig jam. Some real professional adulting shit. You get a desk and your own special computer login and paperwork. Doing Harvard proud.
So, why didn’t you go for it? He leans forward on the counter. He must be tired, standing like that for hours on end. I don’t know, he says; my roommate’s always coming back to the room late and waking up early. He’s never around in the dorm like he used to be. I think he likes the job, but all he talks about these days is work and emails and meetings. Like we’re all suddenly 40.
Well, what would you rather talk about?
He looks down. A little embarrassed, I think. Like I’m probably already rolling my eyes. He says, we used to listen to the same podcasts. Not the intellectual kind, the dumb kind. The kind that’s just three guys joking about random shit. Or the ones with roleplaying games. He doesn’t have time for them anymore — not even the really funny ones.
He’s not telling me the whole answer. I wait.
Look, he says, I’m not stupid. I know there’s plenty of people working jobs like this one who’d kill for a roommate to just get them a desk at an office. Better pay, and you get to sit down, and people take you seriously when you say what you do. Cheese-shop-salesman, or whatever I am, that’s not really what comes to mind when you think Harvard kid. But I…
He sighs. I don’t know, he says. I’m supposed to still be in school.
He glances at a wheel of smoked gouda. Pulls it out and slices off a sliver, like he did with the manchego. Pops it into his mouth and tells me it’s excellent. I wonder if this is most of his job; it’s not busy in here. There haven’t been any other customers since I came in, besides a couple of browsers who left without buying anything.
You know, he says, it’s pretty often my roommate gets back with his eyes itching his head hurting and tells me he didn’t have time for lunch today. What with the meetings and classes and 10 million emails. Doesn’t even seem that stressed about it, like it’s just something he’s used to. And you know what the worst thing is, about that?
What?
He says, sometimes I wonder if I should be jealous.

Nine years after the death of Lucian Freud, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston is providing a new, intimate look into the development of the figurative painter’s artistic expression. Freud is one of the most renowned portraitists of the late 20th century. Even in his early twenties, he had already earned wide recognition in the art world, and his later paintings provided an archetype for the contemporary depiction of the human figure. To give museum goers more insight into his artistic career, the MFA is partnering with the Royal Academy of Arts in London to present an exclusive collection of Freud’s self-portraits. This is the first time in the United States that a collection of this sort has been exhibited. It will be on view in the MFA from March 1 to May 25.
In essence, Akili Tommasino’s curation of the exhibit of self-portraits itself forms a portrait of the artist. Oftentimes, the presence of other subjects in Freud’s art distracts from the masterful work of his painting. It is often tempting to analyze the relation between artist and sitter, especially given Freud’s close connection with psychoanalysis as the grandson of Sigmund Freud. Isolating Freud’s works as self-portraits, however, opens the possibility for the viewer to focus momentarily on Freud’s formal choices before considering his subjects.
The show opens with two pieces that juxtapose Freud’s early and late work. At first glance, the solid colors and minimalist shape of Freud’s “Man with a Feather” stands in great contrast to the exaggerated color and texture of his skin from one of his self-portraits from 2002. The show then proceeds to present his works in a fairly chronological order, demonstrating the maturation of the artist and his craft. In this way, viewers are able to easily appreciate the massive changes the artist made through his career, setting up the stage for what is to come.
The subsequent gallery space displays multiple drawings and sketches made by the artist in the 1940s. The diversity of stylistic approaches found in these portraits gives light to young Freud’s experimentation with portraiture. A number of these works were produced as book illustrations, which allowed Freud to easily dabble in different media and drawing styles. Observing the early sketches of the artists offers a unique opportunity to see him playfully explore different modes of portrayal before settling in his iconic heavy, impastoed style.
It is illuminating to watch the creation of Freud’s identity as a painter evolve over time. While Freud often discarded subpar material, he deliberately left behind some incomplete works. These drafts expose the initial sketchings that are obscured in published pieces by the following months of painting. Additionally, spectators walking through the exhibit are not only able to see the evolution of his style, but also layers of paint accumulating on his portraits’ skins, culminating in the thick and rough texture of his last works. The convergence of his previous works into a mature and intense depiction of skin reveals years of careful meditation. Every painting considered within this timeline hints at the ultimate direction Freud would take as an artist.
Interestingly, the exhibition strives for interactivity, potentially to build an online following. In the back of the gallery, there is a room in which visitors are encouraged to pick up pencil and paper and try self-portraiture themselves, and to share these drawings on social media. With the advent of museums designed entirely to be Instagramable, it is reassuring to see the MFA attempting to stay up to speed without straying too far from their purpose. Drawing, however, may be too time consuming for visitors. With the average viewer scarcely spending more than 30 seconds observing a painting, it would be surprising to see one invest their time into trying to draw themselves — especially if they have little experience. But even if the interactive studio doesn’t reach viral fame, one can only hope that some will find this opportunity enriching.
Near the end of the exhibit, the bubble of Freud’s individualistic representations is broken with two portraits in which Freud is only marginally represented: once as a shadow and once as a small, unfinished painting in the background. The surprising appearance of these works complicates audiences’ views of the artist by presenting a clear example of how he looks at other people. Up to this point, the exhibit cut only considers him a self-reflecting individual, but now the curator highlights that his work is more complex than that. The estrangement previously evident in the abstract shapes that made up Freud’s skin is now visible in the people he paints. Before, his work was only about form; now we have to be concerned with meaning as well.
“Lucian Freud: The Self-Portrait” will leave viewers with the desire to know more about the artist. The exhibition only presents a peek at Freud’s life outside of the self-reflecting mirror. Although the curation is extremely successful in providing a portrait of Freud as painter, it lacks information about the person he was, or why exactly he painted the way that he did. In the end, the exhibition raises more questions than answers about Freud’s complex, illustrious career.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jul. 14, 2017. The Anaheim Convention Center. Then-Pixar Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter took the stage at the D23 Expo — Disney’s biannual fan convention (think Comic Con but with more Mickey Mouse) — to unveil Disney-Pixar’s most far-off animated feature, officially titled “The Untitled Pixar Film That Takes You To A Suburban Fantasy World.” Some thought it odd that Disney-Pixar announced the film so early on. All they had was some concept art, a few sentences on the plot, and an idea for a cool setting. Lasseter probably had grocery receipts lying around with more creative content.
One look at the Pixar canon reveals, however, that the choice is not necessarily surprising. Monster cities powered by children’s screams. Anthropomorphic animal metropoles with rabbit police officers and gazelle pop stars. Sentient, talking cars and fish and toys and physical manifestations of emotions. Pixar movies often rely heavily on the premise; a particularly fresh, well-crafted world can make or break the movie. “Onward” is no different.
The suburban fantasy world is pulled off masterfully, with the creative flair and attention to detail typical of Disney. Skyscrapers are subtly shaped into castle turrets. Little dragons run around the house knocking over flower pots. The Manticore has to worry about paying rent on her tavern. No design element is left untouched, yet everything manages to retain its distinctively suburban DNA. Strip malls are still strip malls. Gas stations are still gas stations. It’s not a new world that director Dan Scanlon creates — it’s our world, just with different, more fantastical origins.
“In times of old, the world was full of wonder — and magic. But, times change,” begins the opening narration. It is in these changed, magic-less times that we meet 16-year-old Iandore “Ian” Lightfoot (Tom Holland) and his older brother, Barley (Chris Pratt). After a spell to bring back their deceased father for a single day goes awry, the two brothers (and their father’s reanimated, disembodied legs) embark upon a quest for a Phoenix Gem to bring back his top half so that they can finally meet their father.
The film centers around the relationship between Ian and Barley, both of whom are hardly fresh, well-rounded characters. Ian is the classic timid, anxious teenager who gets bullied in class and can’t work up the courage to invite “friends” to his birthday party. Barley is his foil of an older brother — staying home on, as their mother describes, “the world’s longest gap year” — who, with his obsession with magic and unicorn-spray-painted van, never fails to embarrass Ian.
As the quest progresses, the tension between the two intensifies (to no one’s surprise), and the emotional focus shifts from their quest to bring back their father to their strained fraternal relationship. The plot does its best to augment this tension; it tries to pull off a “Zootopia”-level twist to get an “Up”-level emotional payoff, but the result falls short. The big, climactic, Disney-trademarked catharsis doesn’t land quite right; the viewer is left thinking, “This is where I should be crying, but I don’t really feel like doing it.” The first half of the movie is partially to blame. Expositional story beats meant to set up emotional stakes are painfully obvious. The frame lingers on Ian jotting down goals in a notepad then dejectedly crossing them out, a valiant but hackneyed effort to signal Ian’s emotional state.
The other characters don’t do much to fill in the gap left by our protagonists, either. Corey the Manticore (Octavia Spencer) is little more than a plot device. Colt Bronco (Mel Rodriguez) just sort of lingers around the edges of the story (but still undergoes an inexplicable transformation by the end). The exception is their mother, exercise-enthusiast Laurel Lightfoot (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), who seems to be carrying the movie on her (probably very toned) shoulders — chasing after her kids in a series of surprisingly entertaining secondary scenes and, in a pleasant departure from convention, playing a big role in the final climactic battle.
“Onward” is by no means a bad film. At this point, it’s questionable whether Disney-Pixar is capable of producing one. The score, composed by Mychael and Jeff Danna (“The Good Dinosaur,” “Life of Pi”), is fittingly epic and sweeping. The animation, as always, is spectacular; a scene where light flowing in from a window illuminates floating dust particles — yes, individual dust particles — stands out, in particular. The premise, the setting, the world and world-building are, again, wonderfully imaginative.
Yet the lack of emotional clarity lingers. Scanlon was inspired to direct this film by his own father’s death when he was a kid, and for him, the story likely holds significant emotional impact. And as touching as that is, the fact remains — for the unacquainted viewer, this impact must be earned. “Onward” felt confused, sentimental without having anything in particular to be sentimental about, and for that, it will serve as a reminder that even the coolest ideas have their limits.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you’re applying to college, school guidance counselors tend to tell you two things: First, craft your application like it’s a story, and second, use that narrative to distinguish yourself. They ask you, what is your “thing?” What makes you special? They encourage you to narrow in on a particular quality, dimension of yourself, or a moment in time that defines who you are and the person you intend to become.
During my senior year of high school, with this advice in mind, I realized that if I wanted colleges to know the distilled essence of “me” it would require telling them a story I had never before shared. The countless hours of treatment and years of struggle that defined my childhood form the pixels of my self-portrait and I knew my application would be incomplete without zooming in on them.
Thus, writing my personal statement became an exercise in working out my life’s narrative. It became an iterative process of comparing my recollections of the truth to those of my family members and mapping these muddled memories onto the familiar framework of a hero’s journey.
At the same time, I had to learn how to package this narrative for an even broader audience. After years of never sharing my struggles with mental illness, even with my closest friends, I was offered the once-in-a-lifetime platform to share my experiences with 18,000 youth at WE Day Vancouver in October 2017. In my five minutes of fame, I hoped to join my story with a larger project of de-stigmatizing such illnesses and nurturing a culture of kindness.
My personal narrative congealed into the format of any good story. It was marked by a distinct beginning, middle, and end, concluding with a set of reflections and takeaways: I was the girl who persisted against all odds. I was the girl who had recovered. I was now using the antibodies of my recovery to try and help heal other’s wounds.
Slowly, without my realizing it, my narrative became rehearsed; it became static. The untamed idiosyncrasies of my previous seventeen years were contorted into a story’s arc. Before I even knew it, I was packaging my biggest “secret,” the very nexus of who I am, into an object of exchange.
For, in forming a personal narrative, an individual is forced to examine their subjectivity from the perspective of a third party. In this way, personal experience becomes an object under observation. This object is separated out from one’s life history, then sorted, analyzed, and extracted from, to produce the narrative in its final, most legible form. It takes on a specific language, interpretation, and emotional valence. Alas, when shared with others, particularly for strategic ends, the once inalienable narrative becomes increasingly distanced from the “self.” Essentially, it is rendered a commodity.
Seen from this angle, when we apply to college, we partake in a kind of commodity exchange. Our narrative is given in order to be repaid with something else: a personal story traded for an opportunity. In applying to schools, individuals must formulate and present a compelling personal narrative in exchange for their acceptance — for future social and economic capital. This narrative becomes our brand, rendering us both easily understandable and distinct. This precedes a process of valuation, where admissions officers put the “worth” of our narrative into direct comparison with the worth of the similarly commodified narratives of our peers.
While any notion of self-commodification makes me queasy, I am ultimately grateful for the exchange I took part in. The small bit of myself I packaged and gave to Harvard has granted me life-changing coursework, phenomenal friends, and an abundance of opportunities. Ultimately, I feel like my application to Harvard composed an accurate picture of who I am and I would not change a word of it.
Why then, in recent months, has this personal narrative felt more like a box than the item of exchange?
Sophomore fall brought to light new inconsistencies in and interpretations of my plotline that I am still sorting through, and still trying to extract lessons from. When I’m ready, maybe I’ll choose to share them. Or, maybe I’ll just pull them closer to me, reveling in their eccentricities, savoring them as a gift for no one else but me. Maybe they can be my little reminder that it is our lack of cohesion that gives us our three-dimensions, making us into humans not characters.
My personal statement was not fixed — it is still unfolding and very much in progress. My personal statement was but one chapter in a longer anthology. It is a signpost of how I thought about myself and my life at a specific moment in time.
There are dangers to sharing our most personal narratives but there is also immense value. All we can do is be patient, be kind, and offer up each day to one another as a blank page — an opportunity for re-statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you visit an art museum today, chances are you will find throngs of visitors huddled around some famous oil painting or a provocative piece of sculpture, taking pictures of it with their smartphones or posing with their buddies for selfies to post online.
There is nothing inherently wrong about documenting one’s visit to an art museum by photographing an artwork one found to be particularly memorable. But many visitors today seem more interested in taking photos of a cool-looking Miró, or smiling with their friends for a social media post with a Monet, than in standing back to contemplate and enjoy the artwork for its own sake.
For one, the rise of museum photography reflects a change in our attitudes toward the exhibition of art. Rather than considering the enjoyment and experience of art as an end in itself, art has merely become a means through which we broadcast our tastes, our values, and our personal lives to the world. This is noticeably the case with the advent of social media. An Instagram post of a Botticelli fresco or a Picasso mural says as much about one’s love of Western art as it does about one’s tastes and one’s social class. It reflects the ability to appreciate and partake in what is considered “refined” and “cultured,” as opposed to what is kitsch and commercial.
Of course, today’s visually saturated, digitally-mediated social media culture is not always detrimental to fine art. Often, it can be a powerful tool to bring a greater appreciation of art to the general public. Unfortunately, however, uploading the details of one’s visit to an art museum also easily comes off as an implicit demonstration of cultural capital. The danger lies in the fact that, in the realm of social media, personal life becomes an enormous exhibition, one that others can access at the tap of a screen. In such a realm, the smaller artworks that surround us become relegated to the rank of secondary exhibits and status symbols.
Museum photography, more importantly, also poses an issue for the value of art itself. This argument was first brought up by the German social critic and philosopher Walter Benjamin, who noted that the widespread photography and dissemination of art damaged what he called the “aura” of the work of art. The aura was the unique historical and cultural context within which the artwork was situated — the original, irreproducible facet of the artwork that lent it its intrinsic value. Benjamin claimed that the mass reproduction of an artwork degraded its aura, making it ubiquitous and valueless like a currency undergoing depreciation.
In today’s museum photography culture, Benjamin’s claim that photography is deleterious to aesthetic experience can be extended beyond the concept of intrinsic “aura” to encompass our personal experience of the work of art. At first glance, this notion might seem counterintuitive. After all, by acting as a form of external memory, photography might actually be considered a means to enhance our engagement with art, since it allows the artwork to take up residence with us in our private albums and collections.
Nevertheless, art derives much of its beauty, its power, and its value from the fact that it can be forgotten. It is the transience of aesthetic experience — the fleetingness of our experience of beauty, the impermanence of our encounter with something magical — that gives our interaction with art its depth and meaning. After all, why should one take a long, close look at the lines of brushstrokes on a canvas, or the play of light and color on the surface of the artwork, when one could just snap a picture of it and look at it sometime later? Why should one feel compelled to pause before the bold geometric forms of a De Stijl painting, or gaze deeply at the smoothened contours of a West African mask, or marvel at the detailed textures of a portrait by Rembrandt, when one can distill the entire experience into an image on a tiny screen?
This is not to say that one cannot both enjoy the artwork in the moment and take a photograph of it as a souvenir. Rather, we should value a brief and intimate moment with the work of art over a picture we will merely glance at a few years down the road. This is why the culture of museum photography might ultimately prove to be detrimental to our ability to enjoy and value art. The problem is not that photography is inherently harmful. The problem is that we should not be afraid of forgetting art.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This month, two student groups — Harvard Jewish Coalition for Peace and Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine — have emerged with the aim of promoting the global Boycott, Divest, Sanction movement on Harvard’s campus.
As always, we remain committed to free speech, and we wholeheartedly support the founding of HJCP and HOOP, as well as other organizations that provide an avenue for students to gather with like-minded peers and express their opinions.
In 2002, before BDS’s founding, we wrote that divestment, in the case of Israel, was too blunt a tool — bearing the potential to undermine the state itself as well as people across socioeconomic, ethnic, and political divides. While our approach to questions of divestment has changed since then, we believe BDS as a whole does not get at the nuances and particularities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. To put it another way, we think it’s important to critically distinguish between the ends of the movement, many of which we largely agree with, and the precision of its proposed means to affect those end.
The Israeli state’s continued record of systemic human rights abuses against Palestinians is worthy of unequivocal condemnation. These abuses include enforcing severe and discriminatory restrictions on the movement of people and goods across the Gaza Strip, facilitating the unlawful transfer of Israeli citizens to expanded settlements in the occupied West Bank, and discriminating systematically against Palestinians in favor of these settlers. Campus groups that raise awareness about these issues are right to be concerned, and should not be prevented from doing so. Accordingly, blanket accusations of anti-Semitism toward those involved with these movements are not appropriate.
Of course, the issues raised here are complicated. Students exploring such issues for the first time should be careful to critically evaluate the records of those — both affiliated with the BDS movement, like BDS founder Omar Barghouti, and in Israel, like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who fundamentally deny the legitimacy of the other side’s claims and needs. Neither side has a monopoly on moral virtue.
While anti-Semitism need not be inherent in the discourse that this movement, taken as a whole, is generating, we maintain that anti-Semitism is abhorrent and has no place on our campus or anywhere else. As to specific individuals, it must be noted that some founders of BDS, including Barghouti, who spoke at the HOOP event via Skype, have previously denied the self-determination of Jewish people and the right of the Jewish state to exist in “any shape or form.” As such, while we strive to promote free speech on campus, we sympathize with any Jewish students who were hurt by the giving of a platform to a speaker like Barghouti.
Still, automatically dismissing concerns over Israel’s human rights abuses and the BDS activists tackling this issue rather than grappling seriously with the moral challenges the movement poses is inimical to the process of open dialogue. Especially between groups with deep, lasting antipathy for one another, that process must be protected, as it will ultimately be necessary to achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.
We support activist work to identify potential avenues by which grassroots activist efforts can put political pressure on the Israeli government to address the systemic racial discrimination within modern Israeli society.
In addition to social movements for equality in Israel and equitable peace negotiations, such measures might include more targeted boycotts, such as on all companies doing business with or in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which are immoral and a violation of international law.
We recognize that the history and current politics of Israel are complicated matters that invoke deep-seated moral convictions on both sides. While we remain opposed to divesting from Israel, we acknowledge that painting either group as “the evil one” is not productive.

Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said he welcomes the new opportunities for student-athletes that will come when the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences joins the Athletics Department on the other side of the Charles river, completing its imminent move to Allston.
As Harvard gears up for the unveiling of its new Science and Engineering Complex in June 2020, some undergraduates have cited concerns about the remote location of the campus, which will sit just over a mile from Harvard Yard in Allston.
But in an interview Tuesday, Scalise said he believes SEAS’s new location will shift the College’s center of gravity closer to the areas where student-athletes spend much of their time.
“For us in athletics, it's going to make our activity a little bit closer to the center, rather than more of an outpost,” he said.
Scalise also said SEAS’s relocation to Allston will infuse ongoing conversations about student-athletes’ concerns — including scheduling and food accessibility — with greater relevance to the College more broadly.
He added that he believes these logistical conversations will have the potential to improve the day-to-day lives of Harvard’s student-athletes.
“It really depends what the University and the College decide to do. It may actually make it easier for athletics because it may actually make it easier for people to get meals, it may make it — give them more time to get between classes,” he said.
Still, Scalise said he remains concerned that certain course offerings will continue to conflict with athletes’ obligations to their sports.
“The issue for us though is that — when courses are offered. And there's going to have to be some sort of discussions on when specific courses might be offered so that athletes are not excluded from taking those courses and fulfilling their athletic commitments,” he said.
Scalise said his department — which is nestled between the College’s central campus in Cambridge and the forthcoming SEAS complex — is considering repurposing some of its space into classrooms and food stations to ensure a seamless transition for all undergraduates.
“That would make it convenient for athletes but it also would make it convenient for all students,” he said.

Harvard added South Korea to its list of restricted travel locations as the University focuses on “contingency planning” for the possible spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
As national health authorities warn that a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. is inevitable — and global stocks tumble — Harvard officials find themselves waiting for additional federal guidance while seeking to reassure students about their safety.
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in a Thursday email — their fourth such communication since the outbreak began — that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has “urged communities” to prepare for the spread of the virus, officially named COVID-19.
“Contingency planning is already underway at Harvard,” they wrote.
Nguyen and Garber also warned that any travel could be disrupted in the coming months. Last week, the Beijing Academy summer program was cancelled due to the outbreak.
“Other countries may be added to the CDC’s Level 3 Travel Warning due to coronavirus and would face similar University restrictions,” they wrote.
As in previous emails, the administrators asked Harvard affiliates to register all international travel with a University registry.
As of Thursday evening, more than 82,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus and at least 2,809 deaths have been reported worldwide, including 60 cases in the U.S. One Boston resident has contracted the virus, and city officials are currently monitoring 33 additional individuals for symptoms.
Federal health officials on Tuesday cautioned that the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. was almost guaranteed, and recommended that hospitals, businesses, and schools begin to prepare.
On Thursday, Japan announced it would close all elementary, middle, and high schools for at least a month in an attempt to stem the virus’s spread, as Italy takes similar measures, albeit on a smaller scale.
The stock market experienced its worst daily drop in U.S. history on Thursday as panic about coronavirus caused global economic stress.
Thursday’s email also urged students who have returned from South Korea since Feb. 24 or mainland China since Feb. 3 to self-isolate for two weeks and submit a health form to HUHS.
Self-isolation entails remaining at home and not attending group gatherings, including social events, meetings, rehearsals, or team practices, according to HUHS’s website.

Brooklyn College Professor Alex S. Vitale spoke to students at Harvard Law School on Thursday about the potential benefits of abolishing American police forces.
Vitale serves as the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and on the New York State Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. He also consults various international human rights organizations and police departments.
The talk, sponsored by Unbound: Harvard Journal of the Legal Left, addressed a range of challenges posed by current police reform efforts. Promoting his book, “The End of Policing,” Vitale described what he views as the dangers of modern policing tactics and suggested alternatives to the police system.
He began the talk by recounting the story of Deborah Danner, a mentally ill woman who was fatally shot by a New York City police sergeant in 2016. According to Vitale, Danner’s case calls into question the effectiveness of police training on mental health.
“The reality is that between a quarter and a half of all people killed by police in the United States are having a mental health crisis,” he said. “It’s the number one indicator of likelihood of ending up being killed by police.”
Vitale also argued that policing has not had any success in curbing drug addiction in the United States. He blamed the creation of harsh drug policies on a lack of political accountability, claiming that measures such as improving training, increasing gun control, and “hiring a few black police chiefs” are not effective.
“In too many of our big cities, politicians who claim to be our friends — who come out on the picket line with us when someone is killed by the police — go back to City Hall and vote to hire more police instead of expanding community-based mental health service, instead of creating drug treatment on demand,” he said.
In an interview after the event, Law School student Leighton Watson said she feels that serious consideration of the proposal to abolish policing nationwide would first require a clear, agreed-upon definition of what police abolition should practically entail.
“Defining what the scope of abolition actually is is where there are gaps,” he said. “For example, when one person means abolition — is that a complete end of what we call policing, or is there still some function in society, someone that responds to you with a gun?”
In his talk, Vitale acknowledged the impossibility of eradicating all police services at once. However, he maintained that there is a great need for systemic change.
“No one is talking about, ‘tomorrow we flip the switch and there are no police,’” he said. “The reality is we have a massive infrastructure of policing and criminalization, and we need strategies to get out of this mess, and those strategies do not include implicit bias training, community policing, body cameras, et cetera.”
Sharon I. Brett, a senior staff attorney at the Law School’s Criminal Justice Policy Program, said in an interview that understanding deep-rooted problems in the nation's policing system is a key step towards creating a better version of that system.
“It's important to think about this framework when we're doing criminal justice reform work and, particularly, to think about the historical context of the institutions that we’re attempting to reform in order to understand whether or not they can be reformed,” Brett said.

University of Pennsylvania professor Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, who served as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights from 2014 to 2018, discussed the global geopolitical environment at the Radcliffe Institute Thursday evening.
Invited to deliver the Kim and Judy Davis Dean’s Lecture in the Social Sciences, Al Hussein drew upon his own experiences working as a diplomat and human rights official to discuss both the challenges and outlook of human rights.
He opened the lecture by discussing what he sees as the nature of the “new” geopolitical order to a packed audience at Radcliffe’s Knafel Center.
“Our balance of power, by its nature, can only be momentary on any extended timescale,” Al Hussein said.
“In over simplistic terms, the U.S. is still the number one dog in the neighborhood, with strong legs and a mighty bite. It’s in trouble, though,” he added.
Al Hussein continued the discussion by attempting to clear public misconceptions and confusion surrounding the field of human rights.
“For most people, human rights exist as some sort of moral Post-It note, or a feel-good, almost decorative annex to the human experience,” he said.
“Human rights are not pretty, nor are they weak. They’re not soft power, or marginal, and they are not ethics or values either,” he continued. “They are a set of interlocking treaties, nine of them, codifying all manner of rights.”
He said he believes China’s actions towards its Uighur population currently pose the greatest defiance of the human rights treaties across the globe. International rights groups say that the Uighurs, a Muslim minority group living in Western China, have faced detention and surveillance at the hands of the Chinese government — allegations that the government has repeatedly denied.
“China leads the pack, unquestionably so. The manner by which it has forced into camps a very large number of Uighurs… it is virtually unique in the world,” Al Hussein said.
Additionally, Al Hussein said that, now and during his tenure at the United Nations, one of the largest threats to the future of human rights was China attempting to cut funding for human rights programs.
“At the international level, [China is] also trying to subvert the operations of the human rights itinerary by attacking, through the U.N. budget committee, the various posts allocated to human rights,” he said.
Harvard School of Public Health student Heather Kitt said she found Al Hussein’s lecture insightful, adding that she was especially compelled when Al Hussein discussed the detainment and separation of children on the U.S.-Mexico border later in the talk.
“That bravery to not shy away from the bigger dogs in the neighborhood and really call out injustices as injustices wherever he sees them is always quite inspiring,” she said.
Amber Gautam, another student at the School of Public Health, said she appreciated Al Hussein’s analysis of the paradox presented by human rights workers who exploit local populations while working in the field.
“He had a lot of insight to give about specifically handling sexual assault and in the context of humanitarian work,” she said. “That was something I really found powerful as someone who is really bringing awareness to that narrative and actively doing something to address it.”

After anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions submitted its appellate brief against Harvard to the First Circuit Court of Appeals on Feb. 19, experts said the case will likely continue for the foreseeable future.
SFFA filed its initial lawsuit in 2014, arguing that Harvard’s admissions practices had violated anti-discrimination policies enumerated in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The organization specifically accused Harvard of penalizing Asian American applicants.
District Court judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled against all four charges made against Harvard on Oct. 2, 2019, determining that its race-conscious admissions process does not discriminate against Asian Americans. Later that day, SFFA president Edward J. Blum indicated intentions of appealing the ruling to the First Circuit in a press release later that day.
SFFA’s appeal — submitted earlier this month — specifically called into question the district court’s application of “strict scrutiny” in the case against Harvard’s admissions program. The United States Department of Justice and various Asian American-affiliated organizations also submitted amici briefs, calling for a reconsideration of the district court ruling.
Unless the court grants Harvard extra time, it must submit its own brief by May 14. A week later, outside groups will have a chance to support the University’s case in their own amici briefs.
Some experts said they believe Harvard and SFFA will continue to trade legal barbs in the appeals process, and beyond.
NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Senior Counsel Michaele Turnage Young outlined a potential timeline following Harvard’s May 14 brief.
“To the extent that SFFA chooses to file a reply brief, they'll be filing that by June 4. I expect that the First Circuit will grant oral argument, though it's unclear at this point,” Turnage Young said. “But I imagine that that may happen three to four months after the briefing is done, so maybe around September, October of 2020. It's anybody's guess as to when the First Circuit will issue a decision.”
“It is likely that whoever loses in the appellate process may be inclined to file a writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court,” she added.
University of Pittsburgh professor of urban education Dana N. Thompson Dorsey also said she expects the case to reach the nation’s highest court, echoing long-held beliefs about the suit.
“So all of this is a legal game right now: a game of chess to get this before the United States Supreme Court, and it will happen,” she said.
Thompson Dorsey added that, if the Supreme Court does eventually agree to hear the case, she believes the court’s political balance could imperil race-based admissions policies.
“I believe all of this is to get this case before the Supreme Court because of the five conservative justices that are currently sitting on the court,” she said.
Regardless of future verdicts in the case, Tufts Sociology Professor Natasha K. Warikoo said she believes Harvard has adequately demonstrated that its policies past constitutional muster.
“I think the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed that it is legal to consider race in college admissions under these circumstances; if you don’t have any other race-neutral alternatives, if there’s a compelling interest, and it’s contributing to campus diversity, and I think that Harvard was able to demonstrate those things,” she said.

Former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun L. Donovan ’87 and former Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Lizabeth Cohen discussed past and present issues of urban renewal at a talk at the Graduate School of Design Thursday evening.
Cohen, a History professor, opened the event with a brief overview of her latest book, entitled “Saving America’s Cities: Ed Logue and the Struggle to Renew Urban America in the Suburban Age.” Edward J. Logue — the subject of her book — was an urban developer who carried out renewal programs combating municipal decay in New Haven, Conn., Boston, Mass., and New York. Cohen framed Logue’s career as a “drama in five acts.”
Cohen and Donovan delved into various lessons from Logue’s life and work on urban renewal, such the difficulties in catering to both the perspectives of outside expertise and voices from within affected communities.
“Logue long struggled over balancing the public planners’ expertise with the role that residents must play in decisions that affect their own neighborhoods,” Cohen said. “Finding that balance, still, I think, proves a challenge today.”
Though he acknowledged the necessity of community input, Donovan — who recently announced his bid for mayor of New York City — cautioned against excessive opposition to expertise.
“We are witnessing a kind of death of expertise in our federal government in this moment, and I think it’s a cautionary tale that when we do react against expertise in too extreme a way, that we end up with something that none of us should want,” Donovan said. “Having said that, I think one of the great lessons of the book is that while expertise is important, it’s fundamental to ask, ‘whose interest is it serving?’”
Prior to opening up the talk to audience questions, moderator Sarah M. Whiting — the Dean of the Graduate School of Design — asked Donovan and Cohen about how cities should adapt to the effects of climate change.
In response, Donovan said people tend to underestimate how small measures and considerations in city planning — such as building more porous sidewalks and planting trees — can yield positive impacts on the environment over time.
“We tend to undersell the power of changing rules, doing the simple things that add up over time,” Donovan said. “I always like to say, if you're really going to make a city more resilient to climate change, every single person that works in that city has to think about resilience.”
Hundreds of attendees packed into the Piper Auditorium in Gund Hall for the event. Some sat on the floor and event organizers added chairs to accommodate the crowd.
Zhanina L. Boyadzhieva, an architectural designer, said her interest in inequalities within cities and housing policy drew her to the event.
“I think it’s wonderful to see a shift in the focus to make sure there is a kind of underlining the importance of policies and how architecture — or any kind of design thinking — can be implemented,” Boyadzhieva said.

From Washington, D.C. to San Francisco, Michael R. Bloomberg’s 2020 presidential campaign is full of unlikely mayoral endorsers who span the ideological spectrum.
Roughly two dozen of them have one thing in common: participation in the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.
The initiative — a joint venture between the Harvard Business School, the Harvard Kennedy School, and Bloomberg Philanthropies — serves as a 12-month training in leadership and management skills for 40 mayors each year. Jorrit de Jong, a Kennedy School professor, is the faculty director of the program.
The program, started in 2017, has schooled some of the nation’s most prominent mayors, including Chicago’s Lori E. Lightfoot, Philadelphia’s James F. Kenney, and Seattle, Wash.'s Jenny A. Durkan.
At least 23 mayors who have taken part in the program have gone on to endorse Bloomberg’s presidential candidacy.
While most of the mayors who have taken part in the Harvard program have not publicly endorsed a presidential candidate, an analysis by The Crimson found that a majority of those who have made endorsements have thrown their support behind Bloomberg.
Using information from the initiative’s website, The Crimson cross-referenced mayors who participated in the program with public endorsements of 2020 presidential candidates.
Bloomberg’s 23 endorsements from current and former program participants far outnumber the total for any other presidential candidate. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 — who took part in the program himself during its first year — received 10 public endorsements from program participants. Four have publicly backed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Each year, mayors from around the country apply to the City Leadership Initiative, and those who are selected go back to school — albeit mostly from afar — for one year.
Hardie Davis Jr., the mayor of Augusta, Ga., said he applied twice before being accepted to this year’s class.
“It has been an incredible opportunity for me to learn from my fellow mayors, as well as some of the world’s brightest minds about leadership and management training,” Davis said.
Two staff members from each of the mayors’ offices participate in the program alongside them.
Bloomberg’s philanthropic organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, donated $32 million to found the program in 2016 — two years after he took the stage at Harvard’s commencement ceremony.
Bloomberg himself has limited involvement in the training for much of the yearlong program, according to mayors who have participated in the program. In the past, Bloomberg has hosted all 40 participating mayors in New York City for an orientation weekend in July.
Albany, N.Y. Mayor Kathy M. Sheehan, a participant in the program’s second class, said Bloomberg greeted them, joined them for dinner, and spoke at an orientation event.
“He was very personable, very down to earth,” she said. “There were substantive interactions about his experiences, as well as talking about the challenges of being a mayor, and sort of the personal side of his experiences as well.”
Sheehan and other mayors lauded the yearlong education that followed. Sheehan said she took part in online courses and was paired with a “coach” who checked in with her throughout the year.
“The experience was really one that helped to empower both myself and my staff members to move forward on a number of initiatives that are really important to the city of Albany,” she said.
André Sayegh, the mayor of Paterson, N.J., said the program was “enlightening,” and that it helped him to become more analytical.
“Nothing can properly prepare you for being a mayor,” Sayegh said. “There’s no real professional development course that you can take at a college, so this was like the equivalent of mayors university, and you receive professional development training.”
Bloomberg, who is estimated to have a net worth of nearly $60 billion, has garnered the political support of more than 100 mayors in his 2020 campaign. Many of the mayors’ cities have benefited from his philanthropic donations, which total nearly $9.5 billion since 1997.
Davis, who endorsed Bloomberg in December, insisted that his ongoing participation in the Harvard City Leadership Initiative has “nothing to do with” his decision to support Bloomberg’s candidacy.
“Whether I had gone through Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative or not, Mike Bloomberg would still be my candidate of choice because of his body of work,” he said.
Other mayors said that participating in the initiative made them more aware of Bloomberg’s political and philanthropic work.
“I don’t know whether it was a direct relation, but I will say that being part of the program allowed me to see Mike Bloomberg’s leadership ability up close and personal — to be able to see the types of people that he surrounded himself with,” Sheehan said. She endorsed Bloomberg in January.
In an emailed statement, Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership spokesperson Lucy Byrd wrote that the program “is non-partisan and non-ideological.”
“In prior years Mr. Bloomberg has welcomed and greeted the participants and hosted a reception for them at Bloomberg Philanthropies,” Byrd wrote. “Since he has announced his campaign in November neither he, nor anyone affiliated with his campaign, has engaged in program activities.”
“Like all programs at Harvard, our staff and faculty are required to adhere to Harvard University's pre-existing prohibitions on political and campaign intervention,” she added.
Several cities with mayors who participated in the Harvard program subsequently received charitable donations from Bloomberg.
According to the New York Times, an education-reform group in Stockton, Calif., received $500,000 in June from Bloomberg Philanthropies while the city’s mayor, Michael D. Tubbs, was enrolled in the initiative. Tubbs endorsed Bloomberg in December and serves as a national co-chair for the campaign.
San Francisco Mayor London N. Breed, who is currently enrolled in the Harvard program, endorsed Bloomberg in January. Bloomberg has spent millions supporting political initiatives in the city that Breed backs, including a soda tax and an initiative to reverse the city’s ban on e-cigarettes, according to the Guardian.
For Sayegh, Bloomberg’s philanthropy is an example of his leadership.
“Why be skeptical?” Sayegh said. “He’s changing the urban landscape here — and that’s coming out of his own pocket. The man is literally putting his money where his mouth is because, quite frankly, if cities succeed, the country succeeds because that’s where the vast majority of the people are.”
Sheehan concurred.

“He could’ve done a lot of other things with his money,” she said. “He could’ve done a lot of other things after he left office, but he chose to stay in it and to try to focus on doing the most good for the most people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a thorough 4-0 defeat of Yale, Harvard will have the opportunity to punch its ticket to the ECAC semifinals in game two of the best-of-three series tomorrow.
The final scoreline did end with the Crimson in steady control, but the game opened with the teams matching each other’s chances. For most of the first period, each team did stake out decent stretches of zone time and a few good chances, but heading to the locker room scoreless for the first intermission certainly seemed like a likely outcome. Then, however, Harvard managed to turn defense to offense and change the entire flow of the game.
When the Bulldogs threw the puck towards the net with the hope of creating a scoring chance from the point, co-captain and forward Kat Hughes became the catalyst of the counter-attack. The blue-line blast looked to be whizzing past her head, but Hughes made a goalie-like reaction instead, flashing her glove, shoulder, and upper body in general to knock the puck out of the air. After playing it up the boards to herself, the rush was on, and the finishing touches of the ensuing two-on-one would be provided by Becca Gilmore with 5:20 remaining in the first.
“We lost the faceoff, and [we’ve] worked on blocked shots all year,” Gilmore said. “Kat took one I think to the head or shoulder and kept with it. We got some speed, caught them on transition...and Kat made a nice second-effort pass.”
As the game wore on, Gilmore would continue to supply an offensive spark. With the Crimson on the power play in the second period, the five-on-four advantage looked to be going to waste as Bulldogs sophomore forward Rebecca Vanstone prepared to return from the penalty box. Nonetheless, with just seconds left on the power play, sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald fired the puck on net from the point. Gilmore would make sure to take advantage of the opportunity. Jockeying for position just outside the goal crease, Gilmore cemented herself directly in front of Yale junior goaltender Gianna Meloni, taking away her eyes with the screen and then also getting a piece of the Macdonald blast for a deflection goal.
“We got the puck in deep [and] got it to the point,” Gilmore said. “Again, we’ve heard all year to get to the net. So I went in for a screen and was able to tip the puck.”
Later in the middle stanza, Gilmore capped her three-point affair with a feed to sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere. Upon receiving the pass, Della Rovere would cut laterally across Meloni before tucking the backhand finish five-hole to solidify the Crimson’s 3-0 lead. And three goals ended up being more than enough for Harvard to get the win given the play of the defense and sophomore goalie Lindsay Reed. Despite being the Crimson’s primary starter last season and through January of this year, Reed had not started a game since Jan. 25 due to injury. She had dressed in games in February but ultimately did not go until tonight, but she was ready.
“It was awesome to get a fresh start—I was really excited,” Reed said. “Getting the start is a huge deal, and to have it on home ice, it was incredible.”
Despite limited action in the first period—only seeing five shots—Reed did not seem to show signs of rust. After making a stick save through traffic in the final seconds of the first, Reed set the tone game for the rest of the game, i.e. later adding a couple of backdoor butterfly-slide kick saves. By the time the buzzer had struck triple zeroes, Reed had registered 27 saves on 27 shots, crediting her success to her ability to decompose the game into smaller segments.
“I just took it in chunks—like five-minute chunks. Just win those five minutes,” Reed said. “And then when we were down on the [penalty kill], win each minute and keep getting stronger throughout the game.”
The defensive effort, however, was a holistic one as the Harvard defenders managed to funnel many Yale chances to the outside and protect Harvard’s shots-on-goal advantage until the final stages of the third. As Reed alluded, the penalty kill was critical to the defensive display. In the second period, the Crimson faced three Yale power-play opportunities and killed all of them. In fact, the Della Rovere goal came just 15 seconds after burning off Yale’s second power-play chance.
“We stayed calm [on the penalty kill],” Gilmore said. “Obviously we know we have a great goaltender backing us up in there, so we’re able to be aggressive. I think we did a really good job not running around but attacking them when we can and not giving them any time and space.”
As the game entered the third, Harvard sought to maintain its lead and play conservatively, scaling back the offense somewhat with only seven shots on goal in the last period. Reed also contributed 12 saves in the final stanza. Ultimately, the Bulldogs would pull Meloni for the six-on-five, but sophomore forward Anne Bloomer made Yale pay for the decision, adding an empty-netter from the neutral zone with just 23 ticks left to ice the Crimson’s 4-0 victory.
Harvard will have the opportunity to sweep Yale and compete in ECAC championship weekend for the first time since 2015, but the Crimson knows that the Bulldogs will be playing in desperation mode.
“We have to know that they’re going to be fighting for their lives—keep calm because it could be a high-energy game,” Reed said. “We want to avoid penalties, just stay cool, play our own game, and bury the puck.”
With the sub-24 hour turnaround, the puck drops tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. at Bright-Landry Hockey Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For much of the 2019-20 season, the Harvard men’s hockey team has relied on its nation-best powerplay to carry it.
But with a chance to score the game-tying goal in the final minutes of the third period on Friday, Harvard’s man advantage failed to come through when it was needed most.
A Crimson win or a tie would have sufficed to clinch a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs. Harvard’s offense fell silent, though, as the Crimson (12-10-6, 10-6-5 ECAC) was shut out by Rensselaer (16-15-2, 12-8-1), 2-0.
“I thought it was a hard-fought game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought [RPI] did a good job defending the hard areas of the ice. I thought through the first 40 minutes, we didn’t win enough puck battles to be able to possess the puck and sustain offense and challenge the tougher areas of the ice.”
The loss marks the first time the Crimson has been blanked this season after the 2018-2019 campaign ended in a shutout defeat to then-No. 3 Massachusetts in the NCAA Tournament’s regional semifinal. It is the program’s first goalless game at home since Jan. 27, 2018.
RPI got on the board early when Engineers defenseman Cory Babichuk scored the game-winning goal on a power play in the first minute of the second frame. The freshman collected a pass just inside the blue line from senior Chase Zieky and fired a shot through traffic that snuck past goalie Mitchell Gibson (1 GA, .957 SV%).
The Engineers’ second tally of the game came with zeros on the clock when sophomore Ture Linden fired a shot past multiple lines to score on Harvard’s empty net.
With under three minutes to go in the contest, the Crimson had a golden opportunity to score an equalizer when RPI freshman Simon Kjellberg was whistled for slashing, sending the Crimson to the man advantage. Harvard rattled off six shots on the powerplay including four with six skaters after Gibson was pulled. But the Crimson was unable to convert.
“We know that special teams has been one of our strong suits, so we were confident going into it,” Harvard sophomore Jack Rathbone said. “We were definitely able to make some plays, [we] just we needed one more play. And I think it wasn’t for lack of effort.”
The Crimson’s first grade-A chance of the game came in the form of a breakaway midway through the first period. Rathbone, a defenseman, broke free of a pair of RPI skaters and made a move to the left side of the net, but Rensselaer goalie Owen Savory (0 GA, 1.000 SV%) made a sprawling save with his right skate to keep the puck out.
Savory made 29 saves Friday. The Crimson peppered him with 21 shots in the latter two periods of the contest, but the sophomore turned all of them away to keep Harvard off the board.
“In the third period, we made a push,” coach Donato said. “At this time of year, it doesn’t take much — a little bit of a seeing-eye goal on their power play goal to give them the lead. I thought we pushed in the third, [and] had some chances throughout the game. Their goalie made the big saves when he needed to.”
The clean sheet is Savory’s fifth of the season and second in three outings, following a 4-0 decision over now-No. 17 Quinnipiac.
“The message in the room after tonight with Coach was just: The margin is so small when you get to this late in the season,” Rathbone said.
Gibson made several crucial saves late in the second period to keep the contest a one-goal affair. RPI defenseman Jake Johnson ripped a blistering one-timer off of a pad save by Gibson, but the Harvard netminder turned it away.
Harvard skated on the man advantage for under three minutes Friday and went 0-for-2 on the powerplay. It marks just the sixth time this season that the Crimson has not scored a powerplay goal.
“I’m not sure we had the intensity levels necessary to draw penalties in the tough areas of the ice tonight,” coach Donato said.
The pressure is now on Harvard to leaveSaturday’s senior-night contest victorious over Union. A win against the Dutchmen would help Harvard’s chances at securing a coveted top-four finish, but it would not be the only necessary outcome.
Because of Friday’s result, RPI now definitively owns the tie-breaker over the Crimson due to its superior number of conference wins (12 compared to 10, as of Friday night). Harvard is hoping for Dartmouth to take at least one point from the Engineers on Saturday — the only scenario in which the Crimson would still be eligible to finish ahead of RPI.
Despite entering its Friday clash with the Engineers in control of its own first-round fate, Harvard no longer has that privilege with one game to go on the 2019-2020 docket.
“We’ve got to take care of business against Union,” Rathbone said.

With a looming and quietly intimidating professor at the front of the room, and what seems like every single student at Harvard crammed into a lecture hall behind you, talking in class can be daunting. This week for Flyby Tries, we decided to push ourselves outside of our comfort zone by raising our hand in lecture every single day.
Day 1: President’s Day - No class!
Day 2:
Janani: I didn’t have any lecture today, so I just made sure to raise my hand a few times in section. I normally have questions during section anyway, so nothing too out of the ordinary. The week wasn’t looking too bad.
Ellen: In a class that I wasn’t particularly interested in, it was tough to come up with questions, let alone raise my hand. I ended up just asking the professor to clarify a concept, and even though I thought I would come across as stupid, the professor was excited to go more in-depth and my friends were grateful for the clarification.
Day 3:
Janani: Okay, raising my hand in lecture was stressful. I had no idea what to say, but it turns out even if you raise your hand, you might not get called on because there’s just so many people in the room. But then I got called on in my afternoon Gen Ed lecture. I ended up asking what I thought were dumb questions — but hey, the professor spent a few minutes answering them, so they couldn’t have been that terrible.
Ellen: As a STEM concentrator, History classes are the place where I feel least confident, but because I seem to be a masochist, naturally I decided to raise my hand in my History lecture. I was less terrified than yesterday, but only marginally. I realized that because I was coming up with questions, I was thinking more critically about the lecture because I had to find things to challenge instead of going on Instagram during class.
Day 4:
Janani: HAHA, I have no Thursday class. Good luck Ellen.
Ellen: I’m jealous of Janani, but raising my hand felt more and more liberating the more often I did it. I mustered up the courage to raise my hand in LS1b, and it felt so freeing. Even in a big lecture class, I felt I had more confidence, no matter whether I thought my question was stupid or interesting.
Day 5:
Janani: My only classes on this day were sections, and I wanted to strike a balance between being vocal in class and avoiding being section kid. I made sure I was only raising my hand when I had a real question or answer. In my math section, I didn’t feel self-conscious and it was actually kind of fun to participate. I just answered a couple of my TF’s questions and got them right too. #flex.
Ellen: By the end of the week, I was comfortable with raising my hand in lecture, and unabashedly raised my hand in my organic chemistry class. I think the confidence from raising my hand has also made me feel more comfortable talking with my professors directly, and I’m starting to learn more as a result. A concept!
Final Thoughts:
Janani: Talking in lecture was definitely weird but actually kind of cool. It was nice to be able to steer the conversation in a room with hundreds of people. I think I walked out of this week more confident and less concerned with what my classmates thought. This was a great way to gently push myself out of my comfort zone — I’ll definitely speak up in lecture again. I realized that the worst case scenario was that I would say something and be wrong. But that isn’t so bad after all!
Ellen: While scary at first, I highly recommend everyone try this. It boosted my confidence so much and kept me engaged during class. I had to really think about the material and frame it as an argument in order to ask questions, and I stopped taking lecture as the complete truth verbatim. Because I stopped caring what others thought, I learned so much more and will definitely be less afraid to ask questions in the future!

Now that Valentine’s Day has come and gone, you may be back to ignoring your significant other in favor of psetting in Lamont or embracing your self-partneredness in true Emma Watson fashion. Whatever the case may be, we could all use a little alone time doing things by and for ourselves. So here are some ways you can introduce some more self-love into your day-to-day life:
Netflix and Chill
Who needs a boo when you have Netflix and Ben and Jerry’s pint-sized ice cream from The Garage? Set aside some time at night to put on your coziest pajamas, grab your favorite snack, and rewatch an episode or two of your favorite show. This is a fool-proof way to recharge, and requires no one but yourself! Bonus points if you get your laundry done while watching; washing that month-old stain out of your favorite sweatshirt is self-love, too.
Gym Session
Hitting the gym is always a great way to destress and work on the New Year’s resolutions you almost forgot about. Plug in those earbuds to easily tune out everyone else while you’re sweating it out on the elliptical. Playing one of your favorite playlists or podcasts while exercising will remind you that you really are the only company you need at the gym (especially because trying to maintain a conversation when you’re already short of breath can be such a pain).
Go for a Stroll
If the intense energy at the gym isn’t really your style, go for a leisurely walk by the Charles or through Cambridge Common instead. Let’s be honest, you have to leave Lamont at some point and get some fresh air, so why not schedule it into your gcal and make it a real commitment? Consider it a time to reflect, breathe, and maybe snap some cute pics for Instagram if you happen to catch yourself outside during golden hour.
Take a Trip to the Art Museums
If you haven’t visited the Harvard Art Museums yet, consider it a top priority on your to-do list. Not only is it a beautiful space with tons of incredible artwork, but it also has plenty of great nooks and crannies optimal for relaxing and entering a meditative headspace. Bring a book or sketchpad if you really want to embrace the pensive atmosphere and get your creative juices flowing.
Explore the City
If you want to escape the bubble, hop on the T and spend the day exploring Boston. Even if it’s for just a few hours, wandering through the North End or Back Bay areas will leave you refreshed. Some top spots to hit are the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston Public Library, Museum of Fine Arts, and Faneuil Hall. With all the picturesque streets, trendy cafes, and beautiful artwork to discover — plus free access to so many places with your HUID — you’ll soon discover that all you need for a day in the city is you, a camera, and some money to spare. Consider it a date for one, and feel free to splurge!
While it’s nice to spend time bonding with others, sometimes you need to take a step back and put the focus back on you. Take these ideas and rediscover the different ways you can show yourself that, in the end, you can be your own best company.
