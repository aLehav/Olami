After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whenever I compliment my mom’s cooking, she never fails to remind me that whatever typical Dominican meal she made that day is not difficult to make — she learned at only nine years old, after all. Her primary concern is that my future husband (who will apparently be incapable of fending for himself) will be perpetually malnourished. I laugh it off and assure her that my husband will be fine, but I am not in fact indifferent to my inability to replicate Mami’s dishes. I worry that the lives of my future children will severely lack the Latin American spirit that characterizes my home, and that in turn, they will be raised without culture.
In spite of my mild guilt for not being able to provide them with the rich culture that has so profoundly shaped my own sense of self, I’ve accepted that my kids’ upbringing will inevitably be very different from mine. Being raised in a household run by immigrant Latino parents defined my childhood. Mami and Papi were learning how to navigate life in a new country — a country that was practically a different world for them — just as I was coming into the world. To this day, we have always figured things out together; we have shared both the successes and the setbacks.
In many ways, my children’s lives will be easier than mine. They will certainly be more carefree. As a child who didn’t yet know the difference between a savings account and a checking account, I would often be charged with the task of deciphering cryptic letters from Chase Bank that I could barely understand even in English. In the end, I would just translate the parts I could figure out and pray that my parents wouldn’t suddenly go bankrupt because of an important detail I missed.
Most of the time, I didn’t at all mind being my parents’ personal translator, and admittedly, it made me feel important. I cannot say the same about other parts of the journey. I’ll always remember the frustration I felt when I sat in front of a stack of tax returns trying to fill out financial aid applications for the first time, and my slight disappointment when my parents couldn’t understand my eighth grade graduation speech in its entirety. More significantly, the pressure to make my parents’ sacrifices “worth it” — to constantly ensure that I am making them proud — is at times draining.
I am far from upset that my future children will not relate to these feelings, but I acknowledge that it is a package deal. Along with my burdens, they will also lose some of the benefits of my experience. No matter how much I attempt to produce a microcosm of the Caribbean nation my parents call home, as Mami and Papi successfully did for my siblings and me, I know that it will be impossible for me to fully recreate this atmosphere. So, what I can and will make sure of is that my kids do not lose our language.
Although I am many, many years away from becoming a parent, I can say with confidence that I will feel like I have failed if my children are not fluent in Spanish. Needless to say, there are countless practical reasons for learning how to speak the fourth most widely spoken language in the world, including an automatic increase in job opportunities. Plus, knowing Spanish often provides comical moments, like casually letting someone know that I understood their entire conversation about me after quietly listening for five minutes, or deciding to switch it up and order in Spanish at Jefe’s just to witness the employees’ confusion.
Beyond these reasons, however, ensuring that my future children are native Spanish speakers is deeply meaningful for me. It would break my heart to see my kids blankly stare at their grandparents when they speak to them. I want them to be able to understand all of Mami and Papi’s stories and their typical Dominican sayings and metaphors in all their glory. I want them to be able to eavesdrop on strangers’ conversations while waiting in line at FedEx in Washington Heights. To listen to Bad Bunny and Romeo Santos and not just enjoy the rhythm, but truly understand the lyrics. To go to the Dominican Republic and feel a genuine connection to the people, the culture, and the land.
My parents had no choice but to teach their kids Spanish so they could communicate with us, but I will have a choice. And even if my cooking skills don’t ever match Mami’s, I will ensure that my children can read the recipes to me as I follow them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard mostly educates rich kids.
The average household income of a Harvard student is 168,000 — two-and-a-half times that of the average American household. Only 20 percent of our students come from the bottom 60 percent of the income spectrum.
If you want Harvard to teach more than just the richest Americans and do less to enshrine elite privilege, its student body should be more economically diverse. But discussions of economic diversity focus too much on financial aid (and admissions) when Harvard’s recruitment policies are far more important in improving low-income enrollment.
Harvard’s published tuition right now — including room and board — stands at $74,528, nearly double that of the average four-year private college.
People cite this $75,000 “sticker price” as evidence that Harvard costs too much, but usually only rich students pay full tuition. The average price charged for a student— meaning the price paid after financial aid and grants — is $18,037, one-fourth of the published number.
In comparison, the average tuition charged for a four-year private college is $32,720, meaning Harvard is actually much cheaper than most comparable schools. That’s still a ton of money, especially for low-income students.
But that’s the average price charged. With Harvard’s recent expansion of financial aid, students whose parents make less than $75,000 will “be expected to contribute nothing” in tuition, meaning 55 percent of the United States could attend Harvard for free. Indeed, research finds that elite institutions like Harvard provide such generous aid that they’re cheaper than any other type of school, including less selective schools or two year options.
Given that the bottom 55 percent of households can now attend Harvard for free and that our school is much cheaper for low-income students than any other type of institution, increasing financial aid will have little impact on socioeconomic diversity.
This conclusion is confirmed by empirical evidence. A study of Harvard’s 2005 increase in financial aid found initial positive effects in low-income enrollment but concluded that Harvard, going forward, would need to rely on measures beyond financial aid. Indeed, the share of students whose parents were in the bottom 60 percent increased after the 2005 initiative but eventually regressed to earlier levels, suggesting the need for non-aid approaches.
In addition, low-income students, if admitted to Harvard, are more likely than any other income brackets to enroll, according to the aforementioned study of Harvard’s 2005 increase in financial aid. If financial aid were a barrier to low-income enrollment, we’d expect low-income students to turn down acceptance more often than their richer peers.
What other options exist? One solution is increasing outreach to low-income students.
Most qualified low-income students don’t even apply to selective colleges despite the fact that those who do enroll have very high graduation rates and earnings outcomes. Moreover, research shows that targeted outreach to these high-achieving, low-income students is both cost-effective and impactful.
Given that exorbitant sticker prices deter students who could attend college for free, Harvard could — both individually and in conjunction with other schools — advertise how cheap selective colleges are for low-income students. Specifically, Harvard should increase outreach to non-elite high schools and community colleges and expand high school summer programs for prospective low-income students.
There’s also the question of admission policies. It’s easy to say that Harvard needs to admit more low-income students. This may get you part of the way towards remedying the socioeconomic gap, as I’m sure there are low-income students Harvard almost accepted — but didn’t — who would do well academically, given that those low-income applicants who are accepted tend to disproportionately succeed.
However, most of the problem lies in low-income students who never apply — not Harvard rejecting qualified low-income applicants. Only 4.6 percent of applicants of the Class of 2008 had a family income less than $40,000, meaning the available pool of low-income students is small to begin with. So, simply calling on Harvard to admit more low-income students probably isn’t sufficient, by itself.
Given that admitted low-income students have very high graduation outcomes, Harvard could recruit and subsequently accept more low-income students without having to lower its admission standards at all while simultaneously providing huge benefits of heightened income mobility and greater campus socioeconomic diversity.
And to be clear, I’m still in favor of increasing financial aid, as I’m not really sure what the drawback is. I just don’t think it’ll have a big impact in terms of low-income enrollment. And, if we’re deciding between spending a million dollars on financial aid or on low-income student recruitment, I’d definitely opt for the latter.
We should not pretend that Harvard is a socioeconomic equalizer. Instead, we should recognize that Harvard mostly admits rich kids who proceed to make a lot of money and that increasing financial aid won’t do a lot to change that. The solution lies mostly in greater low-income student recruitment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oh, how the mighty have fallen — the mighty New Yorkers, that is.
Last week, Columbia University dropped abruptly from second to 18th on U.S. News & World Report’s best national university rankings list, becoming the lowest ranked school in the Ivy League. The unlikely cause of the meteoric fall? The work of one of Columbia’s own, professor Michael Thaddeus, who pin-pointed inaccurate statistics his school had detailed to the U.S. News & World Report University Rankings report: Underestimations of undergraduate class size averages, inflated student-to-faculty ratios, and distorted graduation outcomes.
Thus far, the university has acknowledged it ‘miscalculated’ some of the submitted data; U.S. News seems to have found the allegations severe enough to initially remove Columbia from the ranking temporarily, and the variation between reported and accurate data proved large enough to undo decades’ worth of ranking-climbing.
In identifying and publicly rebuking Columbia’s behavior, Thaddeus embodied the highest ideals of integrity and scholarship. Academics are tasked with the search for truth; when academic institutions disseminate inaccuracies — particularly when said inaccuracies are so conspicuously aligned with their own institutional incentives — they fail their mission. Thaddeus put the search for truth above his personal interests, antagonizing his institution, and we commend him for it.
Columbia’s misrepresentations are a symptom of more fundamental dysfunction at the root of American education. They remind us of our prioritization of rank, status, and prestige above genuine excellence in teaching and research. Intellectual curiosity, the pursuit of knowledge, and just about any other high-minded idiom of academe seem too often to fall by the wayside: The pursuit of prestige takes their place. That administrators at an institution as prominent, well-resourced, and storied as Columbia University submitted inaccurate information only to reap notoriety and prestige is deeply disappointing.
The perverse incentives these rankings induce, the manifestly absurd results they sometimes yield (Harvard and Yale tied at third?), and the disturbingly firm grasp they seem to hold on everyone’s attention — all point to a need for reassessment. Given these incentive structures, we have little reason to believe that Harvard or any other institution would find themselves immune from the pressures Columbia may, perhaps, have felt.
These pressures flow down to primary and secondary education, too. Many elite high schools start to see themselves as vendors of college acceptance letters first and education second. The ideal outcome becomes the AP Scholar with six leadership positions instead of the curious student of character and quality. Parents become customers who are always right instead of partners in the task of educating young people. The goal of raising kids with a sense of drive, independence, and personal responsibility stays in the foreground of our language but fades into the background of our actions.
Statistics of any sort cannot provide a full and reliable picture of the quality of an educational experience. Statistics can be a useful aid — students need help narrowing down their choices, and average class size or graduation rates are useful proxies. But the tail is now wagging the dog, and the culture of American education is in desperate need of reform.

The Harvard Alumni Association announced on Friday the recipients of its annual HAA Alumni Award, which recognizes extraordinary contributions to Harvard through leadership and service.
The award — first presented in 1990 — honors six alumni this year: Janet Nezhad Band ’83; David Battat ’91; Marion Dry ’73; Roger A. Fairfax Jr. ’94; Marlene Rehkamp O’Brien ’82; and Margaret M. Wang ’09.
This year’s recipients have all remained engaged with the University as alumni. Band is a New York-based lawyer who has served as co-chair of the Class of 1983’s 30th reunion, an HAA elected director, and chair of the HAA awards committee. She has received Harvard’s Albert H. Gordon ’23 Award three times for her leadership and generosity to the University.
Battat, a disaster relief volunteer and entrepreneur, offers alumni interviews to Harvard College applicants, a role he has held since his own graduation in 1991. Battat also leads the HAA Committee to Nominate Overseers and Elected Directors and serves on the Committee for the Happy Observance of Commencement.
Dry has participated in reunion planning and fundraising for the Harvard-Radcliffe Class of 1973 and sponsored a Harvard Kennedy School fellowship for leaders from Muslim countries. She was also a member of the 1973 Gift Committee and co-chair of the class’ 30th reunion.
Fairfax, who now serves as dean of American University's Washington College of Law, has been an HAA elected director, treasurer, alumni interviewer, and member-at-large on the HAA executive committee. He has also sat on the board of the Harvard Club of Washington, D.C.
O’Brien is a lawyer and writer who has served as president of the Radcliffe Club of New York and vice president of the Radcliffe College Alumnae Association. She is also an alumna interviewer and founded a popular faculty speaker series as a member of the Harvard Club of Boston board of governors.
Wang was the youngest HAA president, holding the role from 2018 to 2019. She has since served on the Harvard College Fund Associates Committee, the HAA Committee to Nominate Overseers and Elected Directors, and the Office of the Arts Steering Committee for Strategic Planning.
The HAA Alumni Award seeks to recognize alumni contributions and encourage continued engagement with the community, whether through student clubs, donations, or participation in school or scholarship committees, according to the HAA website. Alumni of Harvard, Radcliffe, and the University’s graduate, professional, and extension schools are eligible for the award.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of activists and legal experts said recent Supreme Court rulings will have an array of negative impacts on public health in the United States at an event hosted Friday by the Harvard School of Public Health.
The panel — moderated by Dana Milbank, a political columnist for the Washington Post — included National Urban League President Marc Morial, attorney Esther Sanchez-Gomez, former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, and University of California, Santa Barbara Political Science professor Leah Stokes.
The panelists discussed the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which stripped away constitutional protections for abortion.
“Young people are agitated, and they are concerned,” Richards said.
She called on more health care professionals to talk about how the court’s ruling will impact their patients.
“Access to reproductive health care is not a political issue — it’s a medical health care issue,” she said.
The panel mentioned that the court’s abortion ruling will disproportionately affect women of color. Maternal mortality would increase 21 percent overall and 33 percent among Black women if abortion were banned nationwide, according to estimates in a 2021 study.
Throughout the event, the panelists discussed the rise of disinformation in American politics. Milbank, the moderator, said “the weaponization of disinformation” has “made it impossible to reach consensus, or even have a sensible discussion in political discourse.”
Sanchez-Gomez said disinformation has played a role in the political discourse surrounding recent gun rights cases taken up by the court.
Panelists also discussed a June Supreme Court ruling that curtailed the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Stokes said Congress has since passed language as part of the recently-signed Inflation Reduction Act, which “reaffirms that the EPA has a requirement to regulate” carbon pollution.
“In some ways, we now have more authority — we have more legal bulwarks — to make sure that we can take on climate change,” she said. “I hope people don’t get too depressed about this particular case.”
Still, Stokes said the court’s recent decisions have been “out of step with the public,” which she said could “undermine its legitimacy.”
Sanchez-Gomez said public health research “is what gives us the tools to solve these problems, particularly in [the] gun violence prevention space.”
“Getting together young people, empowering them to have these conversations, and giving them tools like public health research is a hugely important part of this conversation,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after the Massachusetts state primary, Maura T. Healey ’92 appears to be the governor-in-waiting.
Healey, the state’s attorney general who won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination with virtually no competition, holds a commanding polling lead over rival Geoffrey G. Diehl, the Republican nominee backed by former President Donald J. Trump.
Healey leads Diehl 52 percent to 26 percent, according to a poll from Suffolk University released last week.
Healey would be the third consecutive Harvard College alumni to serve as governor.
The poll showed Kevin Reed, the Libertarian nominee, siphoning off 10 percent of GOP primary voters, suggesting that some Republicans are repelled by Diehl.
Diehl defeated his more moderate primary opponent, businessman Chris Doughty, in the primary earlier this month.
Healey has gone on the attack against Diehl, charging that he is too conservative for Massachusetts, a blue state with a history of electing moderate GOP governors. Diehl has continued to tout Trump’s support and attack Healey as being too far to the left.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Diehl’s campaign declined to say whether he would accept the outcome of the election. The former Plymouth state representative also previously endorsed Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 election.
Healey also holds a large fundraising advantage over Diehl. She had over $4.7 million in the bank at the end of August, according to state filings — compared to a meager $17,000 in Diehl’s coffers.
Every statewide Democratic candidate holds a double-digit lead over their GOP opponent, according to the Suffolk survey. Andrea J. Campbell, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, leads Republican James McMahon, 50 percent to 24 percent, according to the poll. State Senator Dianna DiZoglio leads Republican Anthony Amore by 18 points. Longtime Democratic incumbent William F. Galvin leads Republican Rayla Campbell by 33 percentage points.
President Joe Biden’s approval rating in Massachusetts sits at 48 percent, according to the poll, compared to 43 percent who disapprove.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 holds a 70 percent approval rating, according to the survey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard-led team of researchers found that the well-being of young people has declined, relative to 20 years ago, in a study published last month.
The study, entitled “National Data on Age Gradients in Well-being Among US Adults,” was published in the monthly peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Psychiatry. Tyler J. VanderWeele, epidemiology professor at the School of Public Health and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard’s Institute for Quantitative Social Science was senior author of the study.
The report’s results contrast against evidence from the early 2000s, in which life satisfaction surveys produced “U-shaped” curves for well-being domains — with younger adults and older adults showing significantly higher well-being scores than middle-aged adults.
Today, “the left part of the “U” has essentially completely flattened,” VanderWeele wrote in an article for Psychology Today.
The study used online and telephone surveys, as well as U.S. Census data, to assess different domains of well-being, including happiness, health, and financial stability. Its findings show that those aged 18-25 fare the worst of all age groups across multiple aspects of well-being.
The researchers said the findings suggest greater attention must be paid to the many aspects of well-being among young people.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, VanderWeele called the results of his study “pretty striking, pretty disturbing.” Young adults self-reported the lowest physical health and social connectedness of any age demographic, he said.
Though he said the current data is “purely descriptive” and “doesn’t allow [them] to get at causes,” VanderWeele points to economic factors, social media, and political polarization as areas to begin understanding the broader well-being crisis.
“We need to promote relationships and communities; we need to address the financial conditions that young people are facing; we need to help them find systems of meaning,” he said.
“We do need to address mental health issues, questions of anxiety and depression, but just doing that isn’t going to be enough,” he added. “The problem is much broader.”
VanderWeele emphasized that society must take a forward-looking approach to addressing the well-being crisis.
“We need a politics more oriented toward the common good—both oriented toward the common good of the present but also toward the common good of the future, and of future generations,” he wrote in the Psychology Today article. “The well-being of our youth, and the future of our society, depend upon it.”

When Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla was not studying at the Harvard Kennedy School’s library, he loved to feed friends and classmates from HKS at study group dinners with traditional homemade meals from his native Peru.
The last study group dinner of the spring semester was hosted by a classmate from China who prepared a hotpot meal, but over an hour after the original meeting time, Ventocilla was missing.
He eventually arrived at the hotpot dinner, late, but with a dish of his own in hand: Peruvian arroz con pollo, a traditional chicken and rice dish.
“He arrived late because he was still preparing [it],” said Ana Rocío Castillo Romero, Ventocilla’s friend who was a member of the study group. “He wanted to share the arroz con pollo.”
“So we make space in the table, we put the arroz con pollo right next to the hotpot,” Castillo said. “It was delicious.”
Rodrigo Ventocilla was born in Lima, Peru on July 7, 1990. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. Ventocilla, a transgender man, was a trans rights activist in Peru, where he also worked for the country’s Ministry of Education and Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Ventocilla died on Aug. 11 while in police custody at a hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia, where he was traveling on a honeymoon with his spouse, Sebastián Marallano. His family says he was beaten and discriminated against by police in Bali. Indonesian authorities have denied all allegations of wrongdoing.
Ana Ventosilla, Ventocilla’s mother, said her son spent the first 40 days of his life in an incubator because she went into labor when she was only six months pregnant.
Ventocilla has been “a fighter” since he was very young, Ventosilla said.
“We went every day and prayed to the Virgin so that she could save [him] because [he] had been born prematurely,” Ventosilla said in an interview last month. “And the doctor told me that [he] was a fighter for [his] life because [he] got ahead.”
Later in life, Ventocilla became a fighter for LGBTQ+ people in Peru.
Ventocilla had been an LGBTQ+ activist since his college years, when he would ask his mother for permission to drive their old car to attend demonstrations in support of LGBTQ+ rights, Ventosilla said.
“I was scared and told [him]: ‘You are going to go, but please be careful,’” Ventosilla said. “I even accompanied [him] at times, and [he] always had support, love, and acceptance.”
In June 2015, after graduating college, Ventocilla co-founded a trans rights advocacy organization, Diversidades Trans Masculinas.
Morgan K. Benson, a 2022 Kennedy School graduate, said a large part of Ventocilla’s activism consisted of helping trans people find inclusive spaces.
“That’s how DTM started,” Benson said, referring to Diversidades Trans Masculinas. “He wanted people who needed community with each other to be able to have that.”
Ventocilla met Sebastián Marallano around the time he was launching Diversidades Trans Masculinas. While they knew of each other from the activism world and shared mutual friends, their “definitive” meeting occurred at a party in Lima’s Barranco district, Marallano said in an interview this month.
“By then, I had a crush on Rodrigo,” Marallano said. “I liked him.”
After Marallano spotted Ventocilla at the party, a friend told them to approach Ventocilla and to confess their feelings for him.
Marallano followed the advice.
“At first, he didn’t believe me,” Marallano said. “He asked me if I was kidding and I told him no, that I was serious — that I wanted to get to know him.”
During a rally for Ventocilla in Boston on Sept. 4, Vic Hogg, an HKS student in the class of 2023, said they remembered how he would openly talk about his love for Marallano.
One such time occurred during a meeting of the “queer heartbreak club,” a group formed by Hogg and some friends who were going through breakups at the time.
“We had spent all this time talking about how depressed we were and blah, blah, blah,” Hogg said with a laugh. “Then Rodrigo came over and just started talking about how fucking in love he was with Sebastián and how he was so excited for everything that’s going to come and so excited for the celebration they were going to be able to have.”
After the end of the spring semester, Ventocilla and Marallano traveled to Chile, where they married on May 25.
“One of the reasons we wanted to get married — besides the fact that we loved each other — is because we wanted to have the possibility that I could go to Cambridge,” Marallano said.
But Marallano, who lived in Peru while Ventocilla spent his first academic year at HKS, said they never got the chance to visit Ventocilla in Cambridge because they were unable to get a visa.
Colleagues from Peru and friends from the Harvard Kennedy School remembered Ventocilla as an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and a dedicated student who spent many hours focusing on his work.
Rocio Béjar, who was Ventocilla’s boss when he worked in the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance, said he was “passionate” and “a really good worker.”
Béjar said getting a master’s at Harvard was Ventocilla’s “dream,” but that his goal was always to return to Peru.
“He wanted to return — always — to do something for his country,” Béjar said.
Ventocilla brought his studious nature to Harvard, where he would study at the Kennedy School library all the time, according to Benson, who graduated from HKS in 2022.
“I wish we had more memories together because so much of the year he was in the library,” Benson said. “He studied there and he was just doing it all the time.”
Benson said that one of his favorite memories with Ventocilla was traveling to Palestine during spring break, which inspired Ventocilla to think about ways he could “be in solidarity with Palestine” in his future organizing work.
“It was a really intense trip, but the one day we had that was more relaxed, we went to the Dead Sea,” said Benson, who was roommates with Ventocilla during the trip. “We swam and I got my foot all cut up, which he was so sweet about.”
During his first year at HKS, Ventocilla ran for vice president of diversity, equity and anti-racism in the Kennedy School’s student government. In a message announcing his campaign, Ventocilla wrote that “diversity, equity, and inclusion work, especially LGBT advocacy,” was one of his passions since college.
“Through my experience as a public sector worker and LGBT activist in Peru, I know that issues of racism, sexism, colonialism don’t belong at the margin, they should be the centre of what we learn and do at HKS, and afterwards,” Ventocilla wrote at the time.
Ana Rocío Castillo Romero, Ventocilla’s classmate at HKS and a former colleague from Peru, wrote in a text message that Ventocilla “always fought for his beliefs, who he was, and his right[s].”
“Rodri was brave,” Castillo wrote. “Although he didn’t make it, that didn’t stop him from his fight and ideals.”

We already seem to be at that time of the semester where going to lecture seems like simply too much effort. So in case you needed a little extra motivation to show up at those 9 a.m.s – or even 10:30s – now you can play along to Flyby’s lecture bingo to keep you alert during those 75 minutes.
