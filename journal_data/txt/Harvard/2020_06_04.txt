After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow released a statement to Harvard students on May 30, titled “What I believe,” in which he condemned the death of George Floyd. He recalled his memories of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and then, repeated a few cliches about why he believes in the “American Dream.”
President Bacow told us what he believes — now, we, as Harvard affiliates, should call upon him to take his own advice. He is the president of a behemoth institution that actively profits off of the prison industry, which is predicated on the policing and exploitation of Black people. Even in the middle of this killer pandemic, the University has not opened up its dorms to house people experiencing incarceration who aren’t able to socially distance themselves in prison. On top of all that, the Harvard University Police Department is out in Boston policing the very protests that President Bacow speaks of — and this is not the first time.
The very same guns, bullets, and TASERs that the police are using to maim and kill Black people right now? Harvard makes money off of them. The prisons, jails, and detention centers that protestors and bystanders are hauled off to? Harvard makes money off of them. The technology that can track faces of protestors and reinforce the surveillance state? Harvard. Makes. Money. Off of it.
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign conducted research that revealed that at least three million of the 40-something billion dollar endowment is invested in private prisons and the prison-industrial complex, including companies that privatize healthcare, food services, and telecommunications in public prisons. These companies suck the blood, life, and last remaining dollars out of the world’s prison population — which is disproportionately Black and brown poor people — and Harvard invests in them for a pretty quarterly profit.
The University has refused to divest so many times that the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign sued it. The introduction of the lawsuit’s complaint defines the prison-industrial complex as a network which “encompasses the immense web of financial, economic, and governmental actors and interests that use prisons, police, and surveillance to address issues arising from America’s deeply racist social and economic systems.”
“As a result, the humans trapped in these cages — who are disproportionately poor, Black, and brown — suffer, and all too often, die as a result. These are the companies in which Harvard invests,” the lawsuit reads.
As the lawsuit alleges, the systemic confinement and coercion of Black people in cages en masses is deeply repugnant and ethically unjustifiable. That was true under the reign of chattel slavery, and it is still true now in the world of the prison-industrial complex. Harvard perpetuates violence against Black people with its investment dollars. And the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign informed President Bacow of this many times. So President Bacow should take to heart his “What I believe” message. Otherwise, “What I believe” is all talk, no action. It’s all performance, but no divestment.
When we, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign student activists, filed this lawsuit in February, we had no idea how right we would be when it came to the interests of the prison-industrial complex over the literal lives of prisoners. They have no choice but to await in a dirty and cramped cage their illness and death from a new, highly contagious, highly fatal disease. We had no idea that cities all over the United States would rise up against the fascist and totalitarian regimes that hyper-militarized police forces impose. The case for the abolition of police and prisons makes itself. It makes itself over and over again, and the centrist complacency must stop. The prison-industrial complex is a crisis. The torture, capture, and exploitation of people has reached a breaking point. Now, more than ever.
We are calling upon President Bacow to divest from this atrocious industry and to reinvest that money in helping the Black and brown communities that Harvard’s presence and investments have systemically helped to undermine over centuries.
President Bacow wrote, “I hope you will find the strength and determination to act on your beliefs — to repair and perfect this imperfect world.” We too hope that Harvard University finds the strength and determination to stop its slavery-and-prison profiteering. Harvard is the wealthiest university in the world, and President Bacow sits at the top. Bacow calls on us to “repair” this world, but we, the students of Harvard, have to wonder whether or not he is willing to do the same.
This isn’t new. All of the information contained in this article is already available in the public record. And this problem isn’t about beliefs — it’s about inaction. We do not intend to make any statements or implications about the character of anybody, including President Bacow. Rather, we demand President Bacow take real action beyond the simple rhetoric of the American Dream.
If President Bacow was serious about his belief that George Floyd should be alive, that the police should not perpetuate such violence upon the people, and that Harvard University should be on the right side of history, he should divest the endowment from private prisons and the prison-industrial complex and make immediate reparations with the divested funds. Until then, the world awaits for President Bacow to heed his own words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public Health Department reported Tuesday that the number of coronavirus cases in Cambridge has surpassed 1,000.
Massachusetts has seen a decline in new hospitalizations from COVID-19 since April, but the Commonwealth still has the third highest cases per capita of any state in the nation — more than 1,400 positive cases per 100,000 people.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said the “milestone” of 1,000 positive cases serves as a reminder of the ongoing public health emergency in a statement released Tuesday.
“These milestones are solemn reminders that we are still in the midst of a public health emergency,” they wrote. “This global pandemic has taken a terrible toll on the entire Cambridge community, particularly our most vulnerable. Our continued compliance with public health guidance will allow our city to minimize further impacts caused by COVID-19.”
As of June 2, the city reported 1,008 cases of coronavirus, 94 deaths, and 207 recoveries.
Claude A. Jacob, Cambridge’s Chief Public Health Officer and Director of the Cambridge Public Health Department, wrote that those who have been most affected by the disease within the city were older residents and minority residents.
“Sadly, many of the deaths were among frail elderly residents of our nursing homes and a disproportionate share of this disease has been born by people of color, particularly Black and African-American residents of our city,” Jacob said in a statement Tuesday.
In early April, testing conducted by the Broad Institute revealed more than 200 cases of coronavirus in Cambridge’s seven nursing homes.
More recent data released by the city shows that 26 percent of the city’s cases are attributed to residents living in nursing facilities, while Black residents who have tested positive comprise 20 percent of Cambridge’s total case count.
Although cases have surpassed 1,000, Cambridge has a “relatively high rate of testing” and a low positivity rate compared to other cities in the state, according to the city’s announcement.
In his statement, Jacob encouraged residents to continue wearing masks and practice social distancing.
“The high rate of testing in Cambridge is a strong indicator that many of the measures that the city and residents have taken are working,” the statement reads. “We urge everyone to stay vigilant about physical distancing and wearing a face covering when outside the home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students renewed their calls for the abolition of the Harvard University Police Department after HUPD officers were seen monitoring a demonstration held in Boston on Tuesday over the murder of George Floyd, a black man, by Minneapolis police.
The pushback erupted on Twitter after a photo surfaced on the social media platform Tuesday evening showing a HUPD officer, wearing a helmet and a jacket emblazoned with the department’s name and the University’s Veritas crest, monitoring the demonstration in Franklin Park, which is located in the center of Boston.
People across the country have scrutinized aggressive police strategies to control the protests sparked by Floyd’s murder, one of several recent murders of black people at the hands of police. Harvard affiliates had already voiced concerns regarding Harvard’s police department over its policing of minority affiliates and reports of its racist and sexist internal culture.
In response to the photo, which garnered more than one thousand likes and hundreds of shares, Harvard affiliates expressed outrage on social media.
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition also co-authored a petition entitled “Black Lives Matter: Abolish HUPD,” which was addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and other top Harvard administrators. The petition dismissed administrators’ recent emails condemning Floyd’s murder and police brutality and wrote that the University is complicit in police violence.
“Tuesday's HUPD presence in Boston has proven where Harvard's investments lie: not in the wellness or safety of its community but in the policing of Black and Brown communities,” the petition reads.
The petition also questioned why a university trimming its budget in the face of a financial crisis dispatched its officers to an event out of its jurisdiction.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the petition.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement that HUPD officers attended the protest Tuesday night to assist local law enforcement. He wrote that HUPD and local police departments throughout Massachusetts maintain “strong partnerships” and mutually assist one another in monitoring large-scale events.
“Last evening, the Boston Police Department requested a deployment of HUPD mountain bike officers to assist in providing a safe and secure environment for the ongoing protests occurring in Boston,” he wrote. “In the past, we have provided assistance to these departments under a mutual aid request for support in monitoring large scale events, including the Boston Marathon, post-Super Bowl and World Series celebrations, and Fourth of July fireworks.”
The Boston Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In September, HUPD helped Cambridge police officers arrest a dozen protestors on trespassing charges at Amazon’s Kendall Square office. The protestors were condemning Amazon’s business ties to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Swain, the Harvard spokesperson, declined to comment on whether Harvard paid for the security fees associated with HUPD officers’ assistance at Tuesday’s demonstration. Catalano also declined to comment, citing department policy not to comment on staffing, equipment, operations, and security measures.
One of the HUPD officers who monitored Tuesday’s protest was the subject of an internal investigation launched by the department this past summer, according to two HUPD officers who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The officer, detective Thomas F. Karns, had a physical altercation in HUPD’s parking lot with a black officer roughly four years ago after he allegedly used homophobic and racist slurs to call the black officer a “f----t n----r.” Karns disputed that he called the officer the racist slur.
The recent criticism leveled at HUPD is only the latest in a series of incidents that grabbed headlines this past semester.
A January investigation by The Crimson found repeated instances of racism and sexism within the department. In lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews, roughly 20 current and former officers accused the department’s leadership of showing favoritism and retaliating against officers who spoke out against the department’s culture, set by HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley.
Following the investigation, students called for Riley’s resignation and the abolition of the department.
Instead, Riley launched a review into HUPD’s internal culture and its policing of Harvard more broadly. Though Riley tapped a pair of top law enforcement experts to lead the assessment, his oversight of the review and his appointment of current officers to the working group caused the executive board of the Harvard police union to voice dissatisfaction with the ongoing review.
In February, witnesses to an arrest made by a HUPD officer at the Smith Campus Center alleged that the officer involved used excessive force. A subsequent investigation by The Crimson found that the arresting officer, Anthony T. Carvello, had used force while arresting three black homeless men at the Smith Center during the span of five months. Several HUPD officers who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in addition to witnesses of those arrests, said they believe Carvello used excessive force during the arrests.
Anthropology Ph.D candidate Jarrett M. Drake, a core organizer of Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, said in an interview that he was “alarmed” to see HUPD officers monitoring the protest.
“What bothered me about Harvard police department's involvement in monitoring those protests against the murder of George Floyd is that it connects to our own campaign's interactions and experiences with the Harvard police,” he said.
Drake said HUPD officers had a strong presence at HPDC’s gatherings on campus this past academic year. He said he believes the department discriminates against students of color on campus and pays closer attention to them.
“As a black person, I have centuries worth of evidence to fear for my life every time I see a police officer,” he said. “And that applies to a university cop, it applies to a city cop and it applies to a state cop. And the Harvard police has been no different in that regard.”
Reacting to Tuesday’s photo of a HUPD officer monitoring the protest, African and African-American Studies and History professor Walter Johnson called for HUPD to disarm on Twitter. In an emailed statement, he said he was “dismayed” to see Harvard police officers “deployed in riot gear.”
“I do not see how it serves the mission of the university to have its police detailing in the midst of what has seemed to many of us like a national police riot,” he wrote. “It seems to me that it is past time to discuss the down-sizing and disarmament of the Harvard Police Department. At a time when all branches of the university are being asked to make substantial cuts, it seems only appropriate to have a conversation about whether or not a university needs an armed police force, especially one boasting the sort of gear on display yesterday.”
Correction: June 4, 2020
Due to a transcription error, a previous version of this article misquoted Jarrett M. Drake. He referred to "a university cop."
