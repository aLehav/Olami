After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 31, 2012, at 2:15 a.m. 
Harvard Kennedy School professor Ashton B. Carter is on President Barack Obama’s short list to replace Leon Panetta as Secretary of Defense, according to a report in The Boston Globe this week.
Carter, who from 1990 to 1993 led what is now the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, currently serves as Deputy Secretary of Defense while on leave from his professorship at the Kennedy School.
Carter’s candidacy for the top job at the Department of Defense has been boosted by praise from Washington insiders.
“[Carter] is supremely qualified.... He is very well respected in the Congress on both sides of the aisle,” former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry told the Boston Globe.
Despite widespread admiration, media reports suggest that Carter’s nomination is far from certain.
Unlike others on the short list, Carter is not a member of Obama’s inner circle. Candidates with close ties to the Obama administration include Michele A. Flournoy ’83, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy who is also a former Kennedy School researcher.
Still, cracks in former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel’s candidacy have created an opening. Though many political observers expected Hagel to receive the nomination, his chances have dimmed as a result of opposition from pro-Israel lobbyists and gay rights supporters. In the end, Hagel’s loss may be Carter’s gain.
“If Chuck Hagel goes down Ash is going to be on the shortest of short lists as a successor for Panetta,” Kennedy School professor David Gergen told the Globe.
Through his spokesperson, Carter declined to comment on the prospect of being vetted for a cabinet position.
“[He] more than anything, is focused on the job at hand,” said James Swartout, Carter’s spokesperson.
Carter is known in the Pentagon for his sharp intellect and ability to comprehend information that is both policy-oriented and highly technical. These skills, coupled with his physics background, have also led to speculation that he may be a possible candidate for the Secretary of Energy nomination, according to the Globe's report.
Carter came to Harvard in 1984 as an assistant professor. When he left Harvard for the Pentagon in 2009, he was working with Perry to co-direct the Preventive Defense Project, a collaborative research program between Harvard and Stanford.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the game clock winding down, the Houston Rockets found themselves in an unfamiliar position. For the first time in almost two weeks, Jeremy Lin ’10 and his squad were on the wrong side of the score as the buzzer sounded, losing to the San Antonio Spurs, 122-116.
Whereas in Houston’s last game the team thrived while Lin struggled, it was the opposite Friday as the point guard racked up stats as his teammates faltered. Lin had a hand in three of the Rockets’ first four scores, totaling five points and an assist in the first five minutes and 16 seconds.
Despite Lin’s early offensive success, San Antonio controlled the game from the tip, pouring in 41 points in the opening period. Lin’s counterpart on the Spurs, Tony Parker, was a large part of that offensive onslaught, notching 13 points in those first 12 minutes. Parker would go on to tally 31 points and 11 dimes in the game.
Lin finished the contest with 21 points and eight assists, a marked difference from the eight point, one assist line he had in his last game Wednesday. The Harvard alum had help from James Harden and Chandler Parsons, who had 33 and 24 points, respectively, in the loss.
The upswing in his play wasn’t the only good news for Lin in the last 24 hours, as the new NBA All-Star voting results were released with Lin ranking third among Western Conference guards in votes, roughly 500,000 behind leader Kobe Bryant and 200,000 ahead of teammate Harden. If Lin is to start in the All-Star Game, he will need to move ahead of the Clippers’ Chris Paul, whom he trails by only 46,431 votes.
With a few more performances akin to the one he put on tonight, Lin will only increase his chances of reaching his first All-Star Game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith was not left with much to say.
"We did not play well," Delaney-Smith said. "You can't play the 14th [best] team in the country and not play well."
No. 14/13 Oklahoma State (10-0) rolled over the Crimson women's basketball team, 92-62, in the first round of the Surf 'N Slam Classic at San Diego State's Viejas Arena on Friday night. Harvard (7-4) now faces its first two-game losing streak of the season.
The Crimson held a 7-5 lead three minutes into the game, at which point the Cowgirls took off, going on a 12-0 run and never looking back. Harvard, meanwhile, struggled to find the hoop, mustering only one field goal on its first 11 attempts.
Oklahoma State led the Crimson, 42-31, after the first half.
"We were down by only 11 at halftime and we were playing very poorly in my opinion," Delaney-Smith said. "I thought that if we could just play a little better like I felt we were capable of, we could close the gap, but we just started the second half horribly and dug a deeper hole."
The Cowgirls enjoyed another 12-0 run early in the second to jump out to a 61-39 advantage. Junior guard Tiffany Bias and sophomore forward Liz Donohoe led the scoring drive for Oklahoma State with 24 and 18 points, respectively. Teammates Toni Young and Brittney Martin each recorded double-doubles for the Cowgirls.
“They’re a very good team obviously, but we did some things that we could have prevented, that deepened and widened the lead,” said sophomore Harvard forward Temi Fagbenle.
As the game slipped away from Fagbenle’s squad, Oklahoma State out-rebounded the Crimson, 31-11, in the second period. On the night, the Cowgirls outscored Harvard 44-24 in the paint and 26-4 on fast break opportunities.
“We were forewarned and thought we were ready to play a little transition defense and keep them off the boards, and we couldn't have been worse,” Delaney-Smith said. “We couldn't have been more miserable, failing to do both of those things. That was the game.”
One of the bright spots for the Crimson, though, was Fagbenle, who recorded her third double-double of the season with 18 points and 10 rebounds.
"[Fagbenle] played pretty well," Delaney-Smith said. "She played a good game. She fought till the end."
The British Olympian’s last two double-doubles have come in Harvard’s last two losses.
“I really don’t think it’s that important,” Fagbenle said of her recent individual performances. “Especially when you come out with a loss.”
Junior guard Christine Clark was the only other Crimson scorer to break into double-digits with 15 points. Senior forward and native San Diegan Victoria Lippert, who had averaged 16 points per game over Harvard’s last four contests, was held to a single trey in six attempts from the field.
The Crimson had not conceded more than 92 points in a game since a 101-80 loss at Dayton in 2010 and had not experienced a 30-point margin of defeat since last season’s 74-44 loss at Princeton. Oklahoma State has now won nine of its last 10 games by 30 or more points.
“[This game] was definitely not characteristic of us,” Fagbenle said. “We didn’t play like we know how to play at all. It just wasn’t us tonight. I don’t know why that was, but we did not play like we know how to play. And if we did, I think the outcome would have been very different.”
Contrastingly, Harvard’s first three losses of the season were relatively close affairs. Delaney-Smith had seen positives in the team’s tight losses to the strong Michigan and Boston University programs. Friday night, there were no moral victories.
“In some of the other losses there were some good things,” Delaney-Smith said. “There was nothing really good about this game.”
The Crimson will now face Southern Methodist University (8-4) in the Surf ‘N Slam Classic consolation final on Sunday. The Mustangs lost to San Diego State, 88-72, earlier Friday afternoon. Delaney-Smith expects her players to make adjustments for Sunday.
“They have to figure it out because it was a no-show by too many people,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don't know that we could have prepared them any differently. There has to be more fight. There, there has to be more pride.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BERKELEY, Calif.—After fighting back throughout the second half, Cal finally took its first lead of the period with 1:50 remaining in the contest.
At that point, few would have been surprised if the Harvard men’s basketball team had folded—after all, the Crimson’s young squad was facing a Pac-12 opponent in its home arena 3,000 miles away from Cambridge.
But staring at its first deficit in more than 35 minutes, Harvard responded.
The Crimson (7-4) closed the contest on a 6-0 run and came away with a 67-62 victory over the favored Bears (8-4) on Saturday night at Haas Pavilion.
“What a sensational win for our program,” said Crimson coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad has now won three straight contests for the first time this season. “I thought our kids did a magnificent job of showing a great deal of poise and composure.”
After the Bears took the 62-61 lead off a David Kravish layup, the Crimson swung the ball to sophomore wing Wesley Saunders on the perimeter with the shot clock expiring. Saunders put the ball on the deck, and, with one tick left on the shot clock, drew a foul at the basket.
The sophomore drilled both free throws—his 17th and 18th points of the night—to put the Crimson up one with 1:13 to go.
Coming out of a timeout, Cal looked to inbound the ball to guard Justin Cobbs on the left sideline. But the junior was whistled for an offensive foul for pushing off rookie point guard Siyani Chambers, returning possession to the Crimson with 56 seconds remaining.
“He’s smarter than I am, and he used that to his advantage,” Cobbs said of Chambers. “He was able to flop a few times.”
On the other end, the Crimson milked the clock until Chambers—who struggled shooting the ball all night—let fly a three-pointer fly with 25 seconds left. The attempt was off its mark, but sophomore forward Jonah Travis pulled down the rebound.
With the shot clock turned off, the Bears sent Chambers to the stripe, where the rookie extended Harvard’s lead to three with 17 seconds remaining.
Coming out of another timeout, Cobbs dribbled up the court but lost the ball out of bounds—his fifth turnover of the contest. Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard proceeded to ice the game with two free throws.
“In a situation like this three things are important: concentration, composure, and confidence,” Amaker said. “I thought all three of those words could be used to describe the boys this evening.”
In addition to their critical free throws down the stretch, the trio of Saunders, Chambers, and Rivard carried the Crimson offensively throughout the contest, accounting for 44 of the Crimson’s 67 points and 11 of its 13 assists.
Rivard finished with a season-high 19 points after hitting 5-of-12 attempts from beyond the arc. Chambers also set a new mark for himself, dishing out nine assists.
Despite being held scoreless for the first 15 minute of play, Saunders tallied 18 points—13 of which came in the second period.
Saunders' offensive production came in spite of the fact that he was tasked with defending the Pac-12’s leading scorer, 6’6” guard Allen Crabbe, who entered the contest averaging 20.4 points per game. In 40 minutes, Crabbe put up 27 points on 10-of-18 shooting.
“[Saunders’] assignment was to the best he could on Crabbe,” Amaker said. “We told him we weren’t going to be concerned with the offensive production, but we needed to see the defensive efficiency and concentration on that end, and I thought he set the tone for us there.”
Even with his focus on the defensive end, Saunders managed to come up with a number of critical baskets for the Crimson.
After the Bears knotted the game at 46 with 9:49 to go, Saunders poured in seven points in just 80 seconds.
After scoring back-to-back baskets in the paint, Saunders—who entered the contest with just eight three-point attempts in 10 contests—capped off the run with a three-pointer from the right wing that put the Crimson up five, 53-48, with 8:12 remaining.
“That one was going up regardless,” Saunders said of the three-point attempt. “Luckily I knocked it down.”
Following four straight points from Crabbe the Bears managed to even the score at 58 with 4:33 to go, but the Crimson once again responded to the threat. This time Rivard came up big, drilling a corner three off a bounce from Chambers with the shot clock expiring.
The Bears made one last push, as Crabbe hit two free throws and Kravish finished a layup on two-straight possessions to give Cal its first advantage since scoring the contest’s opening basket.
“This was a great team win,” Saunders said. “Hopefully it can propel our team to the next level."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the year winds down and we prepare to enter 2013, the Back Page recalls the top five monumental moments in sports for the Crimson in 2012. From historic postseason play to NBA fame, it was a big year for Harvard athletes in all disciplines.
5.  Women’s Basketball in the Postseason
For the first time in both Harvard and Ivy League history, a women’s basketball team won a game in the WNIT. The Crimson squad, led by then co-captain Brogan Berry, edged Hofstra, 73-71, on March 15. Berry finished the night on point, tying her season high with 26 points, followed by sophomore guard Christine Clark’s 23 points. Despite two threes from Pride guard Katelyn Loper in the final 90 seconds of play that brought Hofstra within one, a Clark layup and a pair of foul shots by Berry ensured victory for Harvard. While the Crimson would go on to fall to Temple in the second round, 64-59, the historic first-round win remains a highlight of Ancient Eight women’s basketball.
 
4.  Football Wins Sixth “Game” in a Row
Near the end of a tense fourth quarter that saw Harvard and Yale trade leads, a 63-yard touchdown by senior running back Treavor Scales with 1:08 remaining gave the Crimson way more than just the first down it needed to ice the game. Harvard beat the Bulldogs, 34-24, on November 17 for its sixth straight win in The Game and 11th in 12 years. Yale football, which had faltered all season both on and off the gridiron, was expected to buckle easily to a powerful Harvard offense. That didn’t happen. Instead, the teams entered the locker room tied, 3-3, after a first half saddled with errors. The second half saw many more big plays, as the Bulldogs assumed a 17-13 lead 1:30 into the fourth quarter. With its win streak against Yale in jeopardy, the Crimson stepped up. Senior quarterback Colton Chapple connected on a 32-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Andrew Berg to regain the lead and then completed a four-yard touchdown toss to junior Cam Brate after a Bulldogs score had earned the visitors a 24-20 lead. Scales’ 63-yard scamper on Harvard’s next possession secured the 34-24 win. 
 
3. Women’s Squash Tops the Nation
After a tight contest with Yale for the Ivy League title, Harvard women’s squash sailed to a decisive win over the Bulldogs just two weeks later on February 26 to capture the Howe Cup, the national title of the College Squash Association. The Crimson blanked first and second round opponents, Dartmouth and Trinity, respectively, with perfect 9-0 wins. While the Ancient Eight cup saw Harvard rally for a 5-4 victory over Yale, winning this time came much more easily, as the Crimson locked up the national title by the end of the sixth matchup and beat the Bulldogs, 8-1. The run of success for the ladies of Harvard squash didn’t end there, as just a few weeks later then-freshman Amanda Sobhy continued her undefeated season at the CSA Individual Championships to win the individual national title, storming past all five of her opponents. 
2.  Linsanity 
A sequence of injuries and poor performances by the New York Knicks led former coach Mike D’Antoni to take Jeremy Lin ’10 off the bench and give him a chance at point guard for the ailing team. After Lin netted 25 points against Deron Williams and the New Jersey Nets, D’Antoni started the guard, who was nearly released by the team just weeks earlier, and created an era of pick-and-roll domination for the team. Lin led the Knicks on a 9-3 run in February before D’Antoni was fired in favor of Mike Woodson and Lin was forced off the court by a knee injury. While Lin signed with the Houston Rockets and “Linsanity” finally began to die down, the alum became a household name and an icon for the Chinese-American and Ivy League communities across the country.
 
 
 
1. Men’s Basketball Goes Dancing
 
Overcoming a challenging slate of Ivy League and non-conference opponents, the Harvard men’s basketball team electrified Cambridge and made it to Albuquerque, N.M. for the school’s first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 66 years. Conference losses to Princeton and Penn jeopardized the Crimson’s grasp on the Ivy title, but road wins in New York over Columbia and Cornell combined with a Princeton victory over Penn allowed Harvard to win the Ancient Eight outright for the first time ever. For its accomplishments, the Crimson got the pleasure of an NCAA Tournament matchup with a hot-handed Vanderbilt squad coming off a win over No. 1 Kentucky to take the SEC championship. Harvard was knocked off, 79-70, by the Commodores on March 15. While the Crimson may have lost the game, the season as a whole was historic for the program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last game of 2012, the No. 20 Harvard men’s hockey team looked like it was still on break.
In its first loss to Northeastern at Bright Hockey Center since 1978, the Crimson’s touted penalty kill, which ranked ninth nationally coming into Friday's contest, was nowhere to be found in the second period. After falling behind in the first, the Huskies (6-9-1, 3-8-1 Hockey East) came storming back in the opening minutes of the next period and didn’t stop, beating the Crimson (4-5-1, 3-3 ECAC), 5-1.
Northeastern gained a two-man advantage early in the second period and wasted no time in tying up the game at one when sophomore forward Cody Ferriero—who scored 4 goals in the contest—powered a shot past Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard.
Even with senior defensemen Danny Beiga back on the ice after serving time for slashing, Harvard was hard pressed to hold off a rejuvenated Huskies offense. Northeastern pounded the Crimson goal with seven consecutive shots before Ferriero found the back of the net three minutes into the period. Ferriero added his third goal of the period seven minutes later on the Huskies third power play.
While the team’s penalty kill performance was uncharacteristic, so was its starting lineup. Senior forward Alex Fallstrom, who has scored two goals for Harvard this season, was slated to start but saw no playing time.
The Crimson also went without freshman forward Jimmy Vesey, who leads the team with five goals and a .600 faceoff win percentage. Vesey was one of three ECAC players selected to represent the US in the IIHF World Junior Championship in Russia and will return to the squad when competition concludes on January 5th.
With those two absent, Harvard’s woes continued in the third quarter, as Northeastern’s leading scorer, freshman forward Kevin Roy, put the Huskies up by three, and Ferriero added his fourth goal of the night to cement the 5-1 victory.
Harvard’s only goal of the game came five minutes into the first period, when freshman forward Brian Hart snuck a shot past Northeastern goaltender Chris Rawlings on the Crimson’s first power play. Harvard saw five more power play opportunities and failed to capitalize on a single one. The Crimson’s 6.1 percent power play percentage has come as a shock this season after they led the nation with a 27.3 percent success rate last year.
With the loss the Crimson drops below .500 for the first time this season.
