After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School will sell portions of its property on 4 Blackfan Circle in order to alleviate debt pressures.
The 11-story building at 4 Blackfan Circle houses laboratory and office space and lies adjacent to the Medical School’s new research building in the Longwood Medical Area. HFF, the agency in charge of the sale, will list eight of the building’s 11 floors—a total of 192,140 square feet—according to documents posted by the company.
Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said the sale, which he called a “difficult strategic decision,” is meant to reduce the school’s annual debt.
“The hope is that the proceeds from the sale of that building will allow us to pay off a significant part of our debt and be able to stop having to draw down our endowment to pay for our operations,” Daley said in an interview in December.
The sale comes as the Medical School closed the 2017 fiscal year with a $44 million operations deficit, marking the ninth time the Medical School has closed in the red across the past 10 years.
In the interview last month, Daley attributed the continued deficit to heavy losses the school suffered during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. High research costs and continued growth in faculty and student size since then have resulted in a “financially challenging budget,” Daley said.
“We have very, very strong plans to bring the budget into balance,” said Daley, who said he has delayed new recruitments to “rightsize” the faculty. “It does require some significant belt-tightening, which we’ve asked for across our staff administration and faculty.”
The potential sale of 4 Blackfan Circle would be a 99-year unsubordinated leasehold interest, meaning Harvard will retain ownership of the building in name, but will cede all other rights to the buyer.
The Medical School and the Harvard-affiliated Dana-Farber Cancer Institute currently occupy the space, while Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital uses the remaining three floors. Harvard Medical School departments will likely remain in the building under the new owner, according to HFF documents posted online.
Along with the sale of the building, Daley said in December that the Medical School has recently observed a positive four percent variance in the budget, which he said will result in millions more in cost savings for the next budget cycle.
“The University has partnered with us very, very closely in helping us to reorganize our finances so that we are confident over the next two to three years we will bring our budget back into balance,” Daley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A quality defensive effort was not enough to offset a rough second-half offensive performance, and Harvard fell to Vermont in the closing minutes, 62-56, on Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
On a night where Vermont fans appeared to outnumber Harvard supporters, the Crimson struggled to find offensive rhythm without starting point guard Bryce Aiken, who is recovering from a knee injury. Between the end of the first half and the start of the second, the hosts suffered a scoring drought of 6:53.
Harvard (5-9) eventually clawed its way back from a 51-44 deficit, but in the end the Catamounts (9-5) regained control and put the game on ice with just seconds to go.
With 41 seconds left in the game, Vermont clung to a 57-56 advantage. Sophomore forward Seth Towns had just hit a midrange jumper, and the Catamounts opted for a timeout. After the Crimson defense had a chance to reset, Vermont forward Payton Henson found himself open in the paint, and he slammed home a dunk while drawing contact. A made free throw later, Harvard’s window of opportunity slammed shut.
“Our record doesn’t show how good of a team we are and can be,” sophomore forward Chris Lewis said. “The games that we’ve played in, we’ve fought every single time, each of my teammates put everything on the line each and every time, and even the ones that we lost we fought to the very end.”
In the first half, the Crimson came out firing from beyond the arc, connecting on seven of 13 attempts. However, this trend reversed in the second period, as Towns hit the only three-pointer after halftime. The Catamounts were much more consistent on long range shots, finishing at 55.6 percent.
A few key three-point misses came in the final minutes. With about three minutes left to play, junior guard Corey Johnson and sophomore guard Christian Juzang each had chances to give Harvard a one-point lead, but each shot missed its mark.
“Those two certainly were the critical ones,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “Wide open shots that in a game like this you have to make in order to win it.”
Towns accounted for three of the team’s eight long balls, finishing with 13 points, five boards, and three assists. However, the sophomore shot just 5-of-13 on the night and did not draw significant contact, failing to reach the charity stripe. In total, Harvard attempted just four free throws in the game.
“We need more from Seth,” Amaker said. “That’s not dumping it on him or putting it in his lap, but he hasn’t shot the ball well. He didn’t shoot the ball well in Minnesota, didn’t shoot it well here today, didn’t get to the foul line. We certainly need his production, and he’s certainly not shooting at a high percentage.”
Lewis made up for the team’s inconsistent shooting with solid interior play on both ends. The sophomore collected 14 points, including a few strong dunks, four rebounds, and four blocks.
Coming into the game, Vermont was somewhat limited offensively due to the absence of leading scorer and rebounder Anthony Lamb, who suffered a foot fracture in practice. Lamb had paced the Catamounts with 16.8 points and six rebounds per game and had started in all 13 of their previous games.
In this contest, Henson made up for Lamb’s production. The redshirt senior scored 17 points in 28 minutes. Drew Urquhart, Ernie Duncan, and Everett Duncan all contributed clutch three pointers late in the second half, and senior guard Trae Bell-Haynes added 11 points and five rebounds.
For the most part, the Crimson utilized a man defense that worked well against Vermont’s strategy of driving and kicking out for three-point attempts. The Catamounts were forced to take a number of low-percentage shots due to Lewis’ commanding presence under the basket. Lewis notched three of his four blocks in the first half, which perhaps led to Vermont’s triple-heavy approach in the second.
“You hold the team to basically 60 or 62 points, and you can’t be disappointed about that,” Amaker said. “We just have to figure out how can we generate more offense. Can we generate it from our defense, or is it going to be from the three-point line, or utilize Lewis?”
Aiken, Harvard’s leading scorer, has now missed four consecutive games with a knee injury. There was no update on his condition or a timetable for his return, but his absence has certainly affected the team’s offensive rhythm.
“I think that’s exactly what we’ve lacked is rhythm, and we’ve been disjointed,” Amaker said. “It’s been a tough stretch for us, and not having Bryce is something that’s taken its toll on our team now.”
This contest marked the final non-conference home game for the Crimson, which begins Ivy League play on Saturday against Dartmouth.
“In some ways, I said to them, it’s similar to having a practice exam for what’s really coming around the corner,” Amaker said. “We’ll hopefully show that we can learn from it and be ready for the actual exam, which starts on Saturday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a back-and-forth affair in Lavietes Pavilion, a strong fourth quarter allowed Harvard women’s basketball to top Stony Brook, 60-53, on New Year’s Eve.
The Crimson took over with a 14-0 run late in the final period to run away from the Seawolves (8-5) in its final contest of the 2017 calendar year.
“It surprised me to see us start so slow,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “But we were able to come on strong in the fourth quarter.”
Harvard (7-5) was led by senior guard Taylor Rooks, who racked up 18 points and five rebounds, and junior guard Sydney Skinner, who tallied a season-high 15 points off the bench.
“Sydney Skinner was battling some preseason injuries and I think we saw the real Sydney last night,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think she was the catalyst for the fourth quarter.”
The Crimson’s 14-0 run in a span of less than six minutes gave it a seven point lead with only 2:30 to play. Harvard sealed its lead on free throws from Rooks and sophomore guard Katie Benzan.
“We kept it close, almost coasting, but then Kathy turned up the energy, turned up the heat, and turned up the intensity to get us to either stop their runs or increase our leads,” Benzan said.
Before the Crimson was able to take control late in the game, both teams kept it close in a tug-of-war battle. Harvard took a four point lead into the half following a strong second quarter in which it scored 18 points to Stony Brook’s 11.
“We really knew that they had a different style of plan,” Benzan said. “They were long and athletic, they liked to run, and we had a few shooters to worry about. We needed to come out and play our game and not their game.”
An 8-0 run led by a pair of three-pointers from Rooks early in the second carried the strong quarter from the Crimson.
The Seawolves fought back in the second half, taking a small 42-40 lead into the fourth quarter, in which Harvard took control following its impressive 14 point run.
“I just think our mentality changed, that we weren’t going to lose.” Benzan said.
The run was sparked following buckets from sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm and Rooks and three-pointers from Skinner and junior guard Madeline Raster.
“Offensively we just took what the defense gave us and didn’t rush anything or force anything,” Benzan said.
The Crimson turned the ball over 20 times against Stony Brook, marking the fourth straight game in which Harvard gave up the ball at least 16 times.
“Turnovers are still a huge problem for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’ll make some adjustments in practice and hopefully they’ll show.”
The 60-53 victory capped off a perfect 4-0 home campaign in non-conference play. The Crimson’s last loss at Lavietes Pavilion was March 4 last year against Penn.
Harvard’s win over the Seawolves concludes non-conference play, leading into the conference portion of the season.
“We’ve been waiting for the Ivy League for a long time now,” Benzan said. “Kathy says our basketball season is broken into two seasons, and we just finished the first.”
The Crimson finished its non-conference season 7-5, going only 1-4 on the road, rivaling its perfect 4-0 home record.
“This is the most important part of the season and I think our league is very, very strong,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everyone is doing very well so far this year. There isn’t an easy game on the entire Ivy League schedule.”
Coming off of back-to-back wins, Harvard will kick off the new year with conference play against Dartmouth.
“We learned a lot about ourselves and what we need to improve on,” Benzan said. “We learned what we need to improve on, how much we can do, and that we can and will win.”
