After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Axing” is a welcome word to a lumberjack, and maybe even to some prudent budget-balancers.  But if you run a Harvard University regional center (if you run a Harvard institute for some global region, that is—not if you are City Manager of Cambridge), markedly less glee accompanies the term. Axing and austerity, buzzwords-du-jour in the corporate, political, and academic worlds alike, have meant significant losses for the University’s regional centers.  The centers, which study world regions including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have suffered a two-pronged trimming.  Federal funding has plummeted by nearly 50 percent, while Faculty of Arts and Science support has dropped simultaneously.  Granting that budgets do need balancing, these developments remain a concern.  Harvard and the U.S. should prioritize this sort of funding.
This view goes beyond a lazy truism that more money is better than less money when it comes to Harvard and its students and affiliates.  These centers in particular merit robust support from FAS, for the near-halfway slashing of federal contributions render them especially cash-strapped.  No Harvard program should suffer disproportionately because of its budget’s historical funding sources.  (And no doubt, the erstwhile subsidies kept down FAS allotments in years past.)
Real losses have occured as a result. The Center for Middle Eastern Studies has folded its academic journal; the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies has reduced fellowships, guest speakers, and winter break courses; and the centers have been forced to lean increasingly on their own endowments.  In part, this is due to a FAS “debt relief” program, which originated during 2008’s maelstrom and has been made permanent, whereby the centers direct part of their endowments to FAS.  (This policy left the Reischauer Center sending 30 percent of its budget toward FAS during the crisis.)  Depleted endowments mean future weakness, and more tangible losses to follow.
All of this lamenting, of course, assumes that the centers’ work is worth any priority at all.  In an austere age, in a school and a country with a great deal of worthwhile alternatives, the standard to be met is not a light one.  The centers’ value may not be evident at first glance—they do not battle cancer or configure new energy sources—but they provide an education not always available in Cambridge, both by bringing students to the world, in the form of study-abroad programs, grants, and internships, and by bringing the world to students, with a colorful stream of guest professors and expert lecturers.  And they focus on key interests of public or foreign policy-minded Americans—not to mention their purse-empowered representatives.  The studies fostered are critical.  Or even, to borrow the federal government’s term for languages like Arabic (see the Center for Middle Eastern Studies), super-critical.
Naturally, the nation has a slew of critical concerns, and budget-balancing is high among them.  But academic research and studies are worth prioritizing.  Worryingly, their support, at both federal and university levels, rides the vicissitudes of political and economic cycles.  In regards to the latter though, the latest cycle does appear, however gradually, to trend with more and more optimism.  With that good fortune, and with FAS predicting a balanced budget by the year’s end, we now hope and expect that the austerity will slowly ease, that today’s fears will erode, and that the axing will end.  Unfortunately, we are not seers.  Nor are we lumberjacks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven and a half years ago, at the age of fourteen, I had no idea that a disease called cancer would change my life forever. My parents and I could not have seen it coming. My dad was fifty-three years old, in good health, and living a normal life when he began experiencing stomach pain in August 2004. Within a couple of days his pain went from mild to unbearable.
My mom and I rushed him to an emergency room. I will never forget the image of him in the hospital bed, wearing a patient gown, as he choked on a plastic nasogastric tube that was sucking out his stomach contents through his nose. The doctors decided to perform surgery, hoping to locate and remove whatever was causing his dangerous gastric blockage. They suspected that the problem was a hernia. They were wrong. When they cut him open, what they found instead was a tumor in his pancreas.
The news just kept getting worse after that. The tumor was too close to a crucial blood vessel to be removed. A biopsy confirmed that the tumor was malignant. There was no “cure.” The estimated survival time of patients with this stage of pancreatic cancer was roughly one year. After hearing the chief surgeon’s remarks, my mom and I left the hospital, stood outside on the sidewalk, and cried.
The diagnosis that turned my fourteen-year-old world upside-down was only the beginning of my dad’s experiences as a cancer survivor. My dad underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to slow the tumor’s growth. The treatments drained him of his strength and often left him feeling ill and miserable. After a year of treatment, however, he was still alive, and the tumor was showing no further signs of growth.
My parents and I opted for a risky move: pursuing a second major operation in November 2005 to remove the tumor. This time, miraculously, it worked. After a grueling, fourteen-hour-long surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the main tumor—along with most of his pancreas—was gone. Two more years passed by without any major complications. Life had seemingly returned to normal for all of us.
It wasn’t until the end of 2007 that the latest scans showed new metastases invading my dad’s abdomen. Our situation collapsed like a house of cards. In January 2008, hospice workers began coming to the house. As January wore on, my dad lost all of his remaining strength until he could no longer walk, stand, or care for himself. By February 5, his body had entered terminal stages. At 4:30 AM on the morning of February 6, while my mom and I held his hands, my dad exhaled for the last time.
Unlike my dad, neither my mom nor I have yet heard the words, “You have cancer.” But we too have been through it. We helped my dad through the nausea and suffering of his treatments. We escorted him to surgeries, visited him constantly in the hospital, and made sure that the medical team took proper care of him. We celebrated his successes, and we did our best to maintain an atmosphere of “life as usual.” And ultimately, we were the people who stayed at his side to the very end. Partly out of our familial love for my dad, and partly because we had no other choice, my mom and I did not just witness cancer—we had to live it.
Without a doubt, cancer continues to mold my personality, to alter my view of the world, and to motivate me to pursue a career as a scientist and as a doctor. It is because of my family’s trials with cancer that I have become involved with efforts like the Relay For Life at Harvard University. Our Relay For Life is an annual overnight walk-a-thon through which Harvard students come together in solidarity against cancer while raising tens of thousands of dollars to help the American Cancer Society support vital research, patient care, and advocacy efforts. In the wake of my own personal experiences with the disease, I have resolved to fight cancer by turning passion into action.
At Harvard, there might not be very many of us who have been diagnosed with cancer, but without a doubt, many of us are cancer “survivors” in some way or another. If cancer has played a major role in shaping who you are or what you do, I urge you to stand up and take action. Whether it is through getting involved in our Relay For Life effort at www.harvardrelay.org, volunteering at the local Hope Lodge, or participating in other Harvard Cancer Society activities, I hope that you will join our university’s ongoing fight against a disease that has taken too much from too many of us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something strange about the fact that a radical document like Rep. Paul D. Ryan’s budget—a budget that would cut taxes, primarily for high earners, by $4.6 trillion while taking health insurance away from 14 million Medicaid beneficiaries—has been welcomed by centrist elements in Washington as a sensible, hard-headed contribution to the public debate over spending. Maya C. MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, declared that the budget “puts our nation on a fiscally sustainable path.” Robert L. Bixby, who runs the pro-deficit-reduction Concord Coalition, judged that the budget “fit the magnitude of the challenge.”
But then again, the budget was written in language that deficit hawks love. Ryan writes that, “At its core, this plan of action is about putting an end to empty promises from a bankrupt government.” The Ryans, MacGuineases, and Bixbys of the world say stuff like this all the time. We can’t afford the government we have. We’re going bankrupt. It’s unsustainable. And to this day, I have no idea what any of them are trying to say. That may sound like feigned incomprehension, but statements like theirs are truly vague, and none of the things they could mean make much sense.
Do the deficit hawks mean we’re going bankrupt now, or in the next decade? I certainly hope they don’t think either of those things, because that’s absurd. Take a look at interest rates for five- and 10-year Treasury bills. In both cases, the rates are negative. You should take two things away from this. The first is that if there were a significant risk that the US would default on its debts in the next five or 10 years, then, assuming at least a modicum of market rationality, those interest rates would be very, very high. For comparison, Greece, a country that actually is on the verge of default, has interest rates of above 20 percent on its 10-year bonds. When there’s a real risk a bond won’t be paid back, investors demand more interest to make it worthwhile. With Greece, investors are doing just that. With the U.S., they’re doing the opposite.
Which brings me to the second takeaway: Negative interest rates mean that bond-buyers are actually paying debtors for the opportunity to lend them money. This is extremely counterintuitive, so it’s worth driving home for a while. When Treasury interest rates are negative, it is cheaper for the federal government to pay for its programs by borrowing money than it is for it to pay for them with cash. In a situation like this, borrowing money not only doesn’t “bankrupt” the government, it makes its fiscal situation more secure than it would be without borrowing. In a situation like the current one, running a balanced budget would be positively irresponsible, a huge wasted opportunity.
So if Ryan and his centrist fans are saying that the debt is unsustainable in the near term, they’re just wrong. But maybe they don’t mean that. Maybe they mean that at some point, when interest rates are more normal, America’s welfare state just won’t be supportable anymore, and we’ll need to, say, privatize Medicare and gut Medicaid (and other aid to the poor) to survive. But that’s wrong, too. The U.S. is the richest country in the world, and yet dozens of poorer countries have been able to provide comprehensive health care to all their citizens for less than we currently spend on non-universal health care. Of course, they use systems—from single-payer in Canada to something like ObamaCare on steroids in the Netherlands—which the U.S. has yet to adopt, but that doesn’t mean we can’t afford good, cost-effective health care for everyone. It just means we’ve chosen not to provide it yet.
Note also that the fiscal crisis in Europe has nothing to do with the continent’s welfare states and everything to do with trying to use a single currency to meet the fiscal needs of seventeen different countries. If you don’t believe me, just look at Sweden, which has maybe the most generous welfare state in the world and has maintained its own currency, the krona, rather than adopting the Euro. As a result, it weathered the financial crisis better than just about any other rich nation, with the possible exception of Canada, which also does more redistributive spending than the U.S. So if you hear people citing Greece or Italy as evidence that social spending bankrupts nations, don’t believe it for a second.
Ryan is a smart guy, and at some level I think he knows that all this talk about “unsustainable” debt is kind of silly. But I also think that he’s serious when he identifies Ayn Rand as the most important influence on his political views (he apparently forces his staffers to read Atlas Shrugged). Ryan’s budget doesn’t make a lot of sense as a response to real national concerns, but it makes a lot of sense as the pursuit of someone who, like his idol Rand, thinks that aiding the poor is fundamentally immoral. The honest case for Ryan’s budget isn’t that we can’t afford to help the poor. It’s that Ryan and his allies just don’t think we should.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anyone going through the interview process to get a job quickly recognizes that companies often go beyond resumes and references to get a better picture of their prospective employees. Sometimes, this may involve finding publicly displayed information on the internet. Alarmingly, though, a background check or a simple Google search is apparently no longer sufficient for some employers seeking to obtain details of interest about job applicants. Recently, a number of employers have taken the intrusive measure of asking job candidates to provide their Facebook login information. This action is an example of how companies have overstepped their boundaries in the hiring process.
Of course, if such a situation makes a prospective employee uncomfortable, he or she can simply refuse to continue their candidacy or refuse a job offer from the company in question. Nonetheless, as the job market becomes more competitive, applicants should not experience such pressure to disclose personal information and this practice should be put to a stop.
However, pursuing an end to this practice is not about protecting those who may be assumed to have ethically questionable content on their Facebook accounts.  Instead, it is important to protect the right to privacy and define the line that separates basic background screening from excessive prying into a candidate’s private life.
Understandably, employers want to hire people who are not only well qualified for a position but will also represent their company in a positive light. As a result, many companies scan social media sites to gain insight into what qualities candidates for employment posses. According to a survey run by Microsoft, a whopping 70 percent of employers have declined applicants based on information found online.  It is uncertain whether the information found that disqualified a candidate from a position truly reflected his or her personal qualities but companies go by what they see.
Furthermore, this blatant invasion of privacy not only affects the job applicant, it may also put companies in a legal bind. Employers searching through personal social media accounts may find information that they are not lawfully able to obtain due to anti-discrimination laws.  Even if employers keep discriminatory questions off an application or refrain from using them in interviews, accessing a person’s Facebook account can facilitate in uncovering information such as sexual orientation, race, age, gender identity, and national origin.
If employers discover personal details that identify an applicant as a member of a protected group, they can set themselves up for accusations of discrimination in hiring practice. Companies that collect Facebook passwords from their job candidates are grappling with a double-edged sword that can and likely may be more detrimental than helpful. While accessing social media accounts may provide employers with a more complete picture of an applicant, the possibility of a discrimination lawsuit should deter companies from continuing or implementing this practice.
In addition, companies that collect the Facebook passwords of their applicants may be violating other regulations. Facebook has responded to these cases be referring the media to the network’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, which makes it a violation for users to distribute login information and to access other users’ accounts.  Political figures such as Senator Richard Blumenthal are already proposing legislation to take legal actions against employers who ask for job applicants’ passwords.  If employers do not end this intrusive practice by their own solution, the public will hopefully be able to count on the government’s support.
An employer should not have access to information about what someone does during personal time through non-company-related social media. The information that an employer needs to know—like, for example, if an applicant is deficient in work ethic, honesty, or ethics—these details likely can be discovered through references, background checks, and perhaps even information that is displayed publicly on the web.
Though searching through these means may not guarantee a perfect candidate, there are few or no other methods of retrieving information on an applicant without violating privacy rights. Decades ago, companies chose employees without having the option to access their personal information on the internet. Asking a prospective employee for the key to their private lives should not be necessary today.
Although actions by Facebook and by politicians may stop employers from collecting passwords from job applicants, ultimately, the general public must protect its own right to privacy. A job applicant can choose to disclose social media login information to a prying company. However, should you come across such an employer, you should instead take a stand for privacy rights and take your skills to another company that will respect your personal life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a balcony overlooking the nave of Memorial Church, Christian M. Lane hunches over three keyboards, passionately pounding chords. He loses himself in the music, as  the gold pipes lining the wall produce a cascade of notes that expand and trill in the large chamber. In the pews on the floor, his audience is captivated.
Two weeks before, Lane had perched on the same organ bench as he surveyed an empty and echoing Memorial Church from the balcony.
He tucked one leg casually under him to reveal a pink and purple pair of striped socks under his dark suit, while he chatted about organ history, favorite composers and goals at Harvard.
Since his arrival at Harvard in 2008, Lane has received international acclaim—most recently with his victory at the Canadian International Organ Competition—establishing his position as among one of the best young organists in the world.
As a relatively young musician, Lane seeks to reenergize a staid school of organists. Lane wants to challenge the organ’s reputation as an old-fashioned or outdated instrument.
He says that organists can even learn from the energy and identity of pop music from artists like Adele and Lady Gaga. According to Lane, musicians must engage their audience with the creativity and passion to lend a unique interpretation to their piece.
“Notes are only the beginning,” Lane says.
During his four years at Harvard, Lane has become an integral part of the Memorial Church and Lowell House communities—on Sunday, Lane christened the first new organ to be installed in Memorial Church in the past five decades.
But though Lane says he has found a home at Harvard, the 31-year-old will step down from his post as Lowell House tutor next year in order to pursue his larger goal: to bring new life to a dust-coated genre that has become in large part irrelevant in today’s popular music scene.
THE YOUNG ORGANIST
Lane grew up in Walkersville, Maryland, a small rural town that Lane has watched transform into suburbia for nearby Washington D.C. and Baltimore.
Although his family was not particularly musical, Lane says that he always gravitated towards music. According to Lane, his mother briefly studied piano while pregnant with him.
“I’ve always wondered whether that explains my musical bent,” he says.
He started to play the piano at the age of five, attending his first piano lesson on his first day of kindergarten. A year or two later, Lane had moved on to the organ.
Since Lane’s father is a pastor, Lane had access to an organ from an early age. The entrepreneurial youth used his talents to play for the church to supplement his allowance.
“I never practiced enough,” Lane says.
But although he attributes some of his technical deficiencies to his sparse practicing, he says that he appreciated the freedom to explore and develop his talents independently, developing a life long love for music and the organ.
Still, “I never set out to be an organist,” says Lane, who was involved in musical theater throughout high school and hoped to move to New York after graduation.
He always knew however that he would attend a musical conservatory, which he did, first at the Eastman School of Music and then Yale, where he earned prizes for excellence in the organ. After graduating from Yale with two collegiate awards, several national honors, and a master’s degree in music in organ performance under his belt, Lane would sets his sights on the international stage.
WORLD COMPETITOR
Last October, Lane won the prestigious Canadian International Organ Competition against fifteen of the world’s most promising young organists.
“He’s kind of a rock star on the organ,” Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck says.
Lane had practiced for several grueling months before the competition, says Marissa A. Glynias ’12, a student and mentee of Lane’s.
With construction on the instruments in Memorial Church over the last few years, Lane occasionally could only practice on the organ at 2 a.m., says Edward E. Jones, organist and choirmaster at Memorial Church.
Lane’s hard work paid off at the competition, where Lane captured his audience with the passion and creativity he channels into his performance.
“He has a dignity and beauty as he plays,” Eck says.
Lane throws himself wholeheartedly into the piece, losing himself in the music until “he himself is part of the composition,” says Dorothy A. Austin, associate minister at Memorial Church and master of Lowell House.
“I can communicate very effectively in a way that my colleagues struggle to do, but it comes for at the expense of technical accuracy,” Lane says.
In fact, Lane lists technique as his greatest weakness.
“I engage in a very physical way,” Lane says. “From a technical standpoint, that’s not a good thing.”
But Jones disagrees. He says that Lane combines innate musicality with an impressive technique honed at some of the best music conservatories in the country.
In fact, Lane thinks that the organist community occasionally becomes bogged down in dogmatic, theoretical discussions of musical technique.
“Yes, all those theoretical and intellectual arguments are important, but fundamentally, we have to speak to our listeners,” Lane says.
His ability to connect to his audience has served him well in competition.
“My goal is to make the judges stop writing, to make them stop and listen and say, ‘Yeah, this is something I can embrace,’” Lane says.
And Lane succeeded in grabbing their attention.
The win will open up incredible recording and touring opportunities over the next few years, propelling Lane toward further musical fame.
According to Eck, Lane now faces a moment when he career has begun to take off.
But Lane modestly says that the victory will not change him.
“If something had changed, it would speak less of me as a person,” Lane says.
HOUSE AND HOME AT HARVARD
Lane moved to Cambridge four years ago to work as the assistant choirmaster and organist in Memorial Church and a tutor in Lowell House.
“I love Boston and this academic setting,” Lane says.
His position at Memorial Church currently facilitates Lane’s three goals: teaching students, playing in a church and performance outside of Cambridge.
At Harvard, Lane sets aside time from his busy schedule to mentor undergraduates with musical aspirations.
“Chris is both an authority figure that we can respect as a conductor but also a really good friend,” Glynias says.
As both authority figure and friend, his position is unique.
Glynias says that Lane’s presence at the church as a successful musician is comforting to her and other students pondering professional careers in music.
As a Lowell House tutor, Lane is known for organizing casual concerts for the enjoyment of House residents. For Eck and Austin, Lane is the apotheosis of the friend and mentor that tutors should be. “He’s very good with undergrads,” Eck says.
Jones echoes this sentiment, noting that Lane’s dedication and determination provides a good role model for young musicians involved in the church’s community.
Next year, Lane will leave Lowell House to tour across the country and abroad, but will remain in his position at Memorial Church.
Eck and Austin says they are sad that Lane will be leaving Lowell, though Austin noted that she wants Lane to have the freedom to accept traveling and recording offers.
“We’d like to clone him,” Austin says.
Lane is also saddened by his looming departure but feels that in order to realize his goal of reviving organ music, he must move outside Harvard’s somewhat insular community.
“It’s important to be engaged in my profession outside these walls,” Lane says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The introduction of two new engineering concentrations faced criticism from humanities professors when proposed at Tuesday’s Faculty Meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Several faculty members questioned students’ ability to balance the course requirements of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering—both of which will include 20 required half-courses—with Harvard’s commitment to providing a broad liberal arts education.
THE MORE THE MERRIER
According to Evelyn Hu, area dean of electrical engineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the establishment of two specialized concentrations in engineering is motivated by both growing student demand and the rapid growth of SEAS.
“Electrical engineering and mechanical engineering are not simply foundational and time-honored, but they’re also rapidly evolving,” Hu said. “Our students are among the first to realize this.”
Both concentrations will be ABET accredited, allowing students to pursue licenseship and doctorate programs in their fields.
Students in engineering sciences currently receive either a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science degree. Both options provide a broad foundation in engineering, although the S.B.—which has been ABET accredited since 1962—requires 20 half-courses while the A.B. requires 16.
Students pursuing either degree choose from one of five areas.
According to Joost J. Vlassak, area dean for material sciences and mechanical engineering, nearly half of the students concentrating in engineering sciences choose to focus on mechanical engineering.
trating in engineering sciences choose to focus on mechanical engineering.
Faculty will vote on the new concentrations at next month’s Faculty Meeting. If passed, they will be only the second and third specialized engineering concentrations offered by the College. Biomedical engineering was the first, initially offered in the fall of 2010.
LIBERAL ENGINEERING?
Although the Faculty Council voted unanimously in favor of the motion to discuss the concentrations, several professors questioned how they would fit into Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum.
“If a concentration that has 20 course requirements is structurally irreconcilable with a liberal arts education, which I think it arguably is, why create even more concentrations like these?,” said Peter J. Burgard, a professor of German.
In order to receive ABET accreditation, an engineering concentration must have at least 20 half-courses. But the need to meet national standards gave some faculty pause.
“I worry that the size of the concentration is driven by the professional demands rather than the demands of the college,” said James T. Kloppenberg, chair of the history department.
Citing Educational Policy Committee guidelines that have consistently encouraged concentrations to curb their requirements, other faculty wondered why only engineering was allowed an increased course-load.
“We’ve tried to create an ethos in which our undergraduate concentrations are not 20 half-courses,” said Diana L. Eck, professor of comparative religion, suggesting that the College might not have consistent standards across disciplines.  “I don’t see this as just this incredible exception.”
But Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris emphasized the distinction between an A.B. and an S.B. degree and reminded the faculty that the College must comply with national standards.
Between the 20 courses required for these concentrations, eight general education credits, two language classes, and expository writing, students pursuing S.B. degrees will have at most five electives in their eight semesters at Harvard.
Some professors said such a schedule restricts a student’s ability to pursue a secondary field, study abroad, or take electives in a range of departments—although some engineering students take summer classes or five courses a term to expand their curriculum, according to Marie D. Dahleh, SEAS assistant dean for academic programs.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, a strong proponent of the concentrations, took to the microphone multiple times to push back against the idea that engineering students are missing out on liberal arts opportunities.
“Having looked at some of the actual transcripts of these students, I don’t think their liberal arts education is being short-changed,” he said. “If the Harvard College [general education and language] requirements...are not enough to guarantee a liberal education, then we should change the College-wide requirements.”
And Hu suggested that the team-based design opportunities offered by at least half of the four extra requirements were an invaluable “out-of-textbook experience that is very important for almost any student.”
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds suggested that appropriate support networks can help students take advantage of the full scope of Harvard’s academic offerings.
“Without SEAS’ commitment to the fact that these are not engineering students at a more traditional engineering school, but students at Harvard College, we would not have been in support of this motion,” she said.
SETTING THE PACE
Hu closed the meeting with a request for faculty to take a chance on what she called a “unique opportunity” for Harvard to take the lead in re-envisioning undergraduate engineering education.
“[These issues] will continue to be contentious, but if we don’t do it here—if engineering and liberal arts are so intrinsically antithetical that its impossible to join them under the roof of Harvard—I don’t think it will be done anywhere else,” she said.
She emphasized that students choose Harvard knowing that it is a champion of the liberal arts.
“We have students coming into SEAS who have been accepted into MIT and Stanford and other well-known engineering schools,” she said.
“They are very cognizant of the fact that they want to do engineering... at a school that is not known for engineering,” she added. “They are looking for something else.”
OTHER BUSINESS
Dean of the FAS Michael D. Smith opened the meeting by announcing the results of the recent Faculty Council elections, in which 236 ballots were cast. Four women and two men representing three tenured and three non-tenured positions at the University were elected to the Council. The six new members will assume their roles on the first of July.
Although eclipsed by the more lengthy discussion on the SEAS concentrations, revisions to the Student Handbook were also presented to the faculty by Dean Harris. Wording has already been changed to acknowledge the official recognition of Reserve Officers’ Training Corps on campus and to better coordinate the language regarding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act with federal law.
Additionally, faculty voted unanimously to modify the Handbook to give the Administration Board jurisdiction over academic performance of College undergraduates taking classes at the Harvard Summer School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Excuse me, you are from Currier,” said Blondell Newbon, a checker for Adams House Dining Hall, as she handed an ID back to one disgruntled Currierite during dinner Tuesday. “I’m sorry, but you can’t eat here.”
Effective Tuesday for an indefinite period, all members of Currier House—including its students, tutors, and faculty—are banned from the entirety of Adams House, according to a declaration of war issued by Adams House on Monday night.
After Currier student tampered with the Adams’ mascot selection process last weekend, Adams responded with a call to arms.
According to Antone Martinho III ’13, Adams HoCo Chair of Special Projects, the link to the online poll was leaked to students in Currier House, who encouraged fellow Currierites to disrupt the selection process by casting votes.
Though Adams has 589 residents, including the newly assigned freshman, the poll received more than 680 votes, Martinho said. About 300 votes were cast for “acorn,” while other options, such as “dragon,” “phoenix,” “unicorn,” and “bear,” split the remaining votes, he said.
“This is part of House life and something that should be contained within its members,” Martinho said. “It was completely unacceptable of Currier to engage in the vote.”
In response to Currier’s involvement in the vote, Adams initiated war at its HoCo meeting Monday night.
In its declaration of war, Adams HoCo named Currier students “pariah and anathema,” and designated Currier House a colony of Adams House.
On Tuesday night, Currier students responded with a letter circulated over its House listserv.
The letter formally accepted the challenge and justified Currier’s participation in the poll by insisting that Adams HoCo “sought to control the outcome through the politics of fear, demanding HUIDs from its citizenry before they could vote.”
The letter also condemned Adams’ “history of unchecked aggression against its neighbors” as well as the “haughty attitudes and priggish insults that Adams has long spewed out from behind gilded gates.”
Members of Currier HoCo could not be reached for comment.
In addition to Adams and Currier, two additional Houses joined forces in solidarity with Currier.
Pforzheimer House published the “Mario Doctrine,” named after Pforzheimer Building Manager and “Secretary of Depfense” Mario E. Leon, which pledges allegiance with Currier. It warns that “the full might and courage of the Pfolar Bear Cavalry shall be unleashed on Adams House if any members of Currier House are harmed or inconvenienced by the treachery and snobbery of Adams House.”
In the “Decree to Save the Tree,” Mather House also allied itself with Currier.
The decree stated that if Adams does not withdraw its declaration of war by midnight on Wednesday, Mather will also declare war in solidarity with its Quad allies.
“After almost eight years of peace, Mather does not wish to enter hostilities with any house,” the decree read. “But where there is tyranny, we will fight for the right to maintain housing independence,”
Currier also anticipates support from Cabot House, according to an email to the Crimson from Nicholas P. Stanford ’12, who is in charge of Currier’s war effort.
According to the declaration drafted by Adams HoCo, the war will persist until “the entire population of the former Currier House makes a suitable act of penance to the students of Adams House.”
The chaos of wartime extends beyond the student body to Adams House staff, who have been asked to ensure that Currier students do not use the Adams dining hall.
Newbon—who swipes students’ IDs in the dining hall—said that by the time the swipe machine displays a student’s House affiliation, the student will likely have already entered the servery, sending her on a wild goose chase for the escaped Currierite.
“I will have to get up and hold the line up when it’s busy,” Newbon said.
Newbon—who has worked with Harvard University Dining Services for 20 years—said that while she can usually tell freshman apart from upperclassmen, Currierites will be more difficult to spot.
“But I will do my best,” Newbon said.
Currier said in its declaration that it will only accept a surrender from Adams under one condition.
“They must adopt the Acorn as their mascot, so that one day their mascot may also blossom into a Tree,” the letter read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff visited Harvard Tuesday to take part in the signing ceremony of a five-year fellowship agreement between her government and Harvard University. The fellowship will provide financial support for Brazilian students who are admitted to Harvard and wish to pursue studies in the sciences.
“Knowledge and talent know no national boundaries,” University President Drew G. Faust said. “And the most pressing challenges that humanity faces must be faced in the broadest possible context—a context that is interdisciplinary and a context that is international.”
Brazil’s National Council for Scientific and Technological Development will provide funds that will allow around a hundred Brazilian students to attend Harvard. This group will include a small number of undergraduates, 30 to 40 doctoral students, and 40 postdoctoral fellows who may have found Harvard too costly to attend otherwise. Further, during the next five years, Brazil will send scholars to Harvard for year-long fellowships.
Jorge I. Dominguez, Harvard’s vice provost for international affairs, said that Harvard has seen a continual increase in the number of Brazilian students over the past two decades.
“This agreement is extremely farsighted on the part of the Brazilian government,” he said.
After their signing ceremony late Tuesday afternoon, Faust and Rousseff appeared at the Harvard Kennedy School. During her speech, which was simultaneously translated from Portuguese, Rousseff said that the level of progress in a society can be assessed by the number of women in prominent positions.
She continued that today, little girls can dream of becoming the president of Brazil or the president of Harvard—possibilities that she did not imagine as a child.
Rousseff focused on Brazil’s impressive economic and social strides during her speech, but she acknowledged that much national progress remains to be seen.
“I must be very clear in my remarks,” she said. “The fact remains that we have huge challenges ahead.”
Such challenges include eradicating “extreme poverty,” she said, while implementing educational opportunities—especially in science. The fellowship is one facet of this effort.
Lucas G. Freitas ’15, who is also a Crimson photo editor, was among a group of Brazilian students that met Rousseff prior to the signing ceremony.
“In the beginning when she was elected, a lot of Brazilians didn’t like her, because she was not initially as charismatic as the previous president,” he said. “A lot of the students [that attended today] now think that she is a much better candidate.”
He continued that his Brazilian classmates were impressed by Rousseff’s improved public speaking and her straightforward answers to questions posed by the audience.
The signing of this agreement is consistent with Harvard’s efforts to further the University’s internationalization.
“With the signing of this agreement, the Brazilian government will be making a Harvard education in the fields of science and technology available to talented Brazilian students without regard to financial status,” Faust said.
She added that this initiative will strengthen the University’s ongoing efforts to increase access to education to “the widest possible array of talent.”
The agreement was signed by The Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education, Brazil’s National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, and Harvard University.

Curious students of various religious backgrounds gathered to learn and ask questions about Mormonism in the annual “Meet the Mormons” event in Harvard Hall on Tuesday.
Hosted by the Harvard Latter-Day Saint Student Association, the event aimed to provide members of the Harvard community with information about the Mormon faith, including a history of the religion and an explanation of the central beliefs. Copies of the Book of Mormon and other Mormon literature were also made available to attendees.
Members of the audience directed a number of questions to a panel of four Mormon students about topics including the content of the Book of Mormon, Mormon attitudes toward homosexuality, and the Mormon conception of heaven.
Ruth B. Pimentel ’12, former president of the Harvard Latter-Day Saint Student Organization, estimated that about 30 non-members attended the event.
“I was really impressed by the questions that were asked. They were insightful,” said Philip M. Ngo ’14, one of the event’s panelists.
But some members of the audience said that questions still remain about Mormon practices.
“I was expecting more of an explanation of how their doctrine was different from the traditional Christian doctrine,” Bryan H. Padilla ’15 said.
Padilla and Richard A. Lopez ’15, members of Harvard College Faith and Action, noted that they were interested in understanding the differences between Mormonism and traditional Christianity.
“We wanted to come and just learn more about what Mormonism is, so we could talk with people about it on an intellectual basis” Lopez said.

When being questioned or detained by law enforcement officials, minorities should be respectful, but also understand their rights as citizens, panelists said at a “Know Your Rights Panel” on Tuesday.
Hosted by the Harvard Islamic Society, Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA, the Institute of Politics, and the Harvard College Sudanese Society, the event featured president of the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers and detective Larry Ellison and American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney Sarah Wunsch.
“Know Your Rights” was the first in a series of events that comprise a two-week Islamic Awareness Fortnight, which is intended to educate the Harvard community about Islamic culture and beliefs.
President of the Islamic Society Ana R. Nast ’12 said the panel was organized in response to two recent events related to racial and religious profiling: the shooting of Sanford, Fla. teenager Trayvon Martin and the New York Police Department’s surveillance of Muslims in the New York area.
The event opened with the screening of a video that instructs Muslims and individuals of Middle Eastern descent about how to react when agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation make a surprise visit to their homes or office places.
Wunsch reminded attendees that they are not required to answer questions and instructed them to call her or another attorney in the event of an FBI visit.
“We need to educate people about their rights so that they don’t get scared when answering questions,” Wunsch said. “You can easily get sucked into uncomfortable situations.”
Ellison said that as a black male, he understands the frustration of racial profiling.
“It’s happened to me, even while I was working,” he said.
Ellison also said that it might be helpful for minorities to wear certain types of clothing, such as collared shirts, to avoid being profiled by police.
Though RAZA president Edward Escalon ’14 said he enjoyed the event and thought it was useful for the members of his organization, he said he was “put off” by Ellison’s suggestion to dress differently.
“I don’t think I should have to stop wearing my hoodie in order to not be profiled by police,” Escalon said.
The event concluded with another video that described how individuals should behave when detained by airport security personnel.
As a non-Boston native, Fatima O. Mubarak ’15 travels often, and said that she found the airport segment of the panel particularly useful as a person of color.
She added that she enjoyed the opportunity to learn about her rights in sensitive environment.
Other events in the Awareness Fortnight include a “Taste of Islam” study break, a community prayer, and a presentation on Islamic Leadership in America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Senator Rick Santorum announced Tuesday that he would suspend his campaign for the presidency, leaving a clear path for former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney to assume the Republican nomination and challenge President Barack Obama in November’s election.
Even though the Republican national convention will not take place until August, Harvard professors said that Romney has nothing between himself and the nomination. Both Romney and the president are Harvard alumni—Romney from Harvard Business and Law School, Obama from just the Law School—making the race the first between two Harvardians since 2000.
“[Romney] technically doesn’t have enough delegates yet,” Institute of Politics director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said, but “there’s no political scenario that would create any other outcome than a Romney nomination.”
As he began to pull away in the race for delegates in recent weeks, Romney already had begun to shift his focus to the general election and Obama. Professors said Romney is likely to regroup further as the Republican primary season draws to a close in the coming months, better tempering his campaign and its message for the fall.
“I would think that he’s going to shift into a prolonged media and fundraising tour, and he’ll use the completion of the primary cycle as an extended series of victory laps,” said Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Richard Parker. “He’ll use the process of seeming to campaign to test messages.”
A key part of that message will inevitably be choosing a running-mate, but it will also be setting the tenor of the race. Professors said the match-up between the former Massachusetts governor and the president will likely have a different focus than the Republican nominating race.
“Campaigns seek to mobilize their core supporters and appeal to those who are undecided or persuadable. In doing so, they emphasize those issues and themes that are uppermost in the minds of voters and those issues that play to their strengths,” Harvard Kennedy School professor Roger B. Porter wrote in an email.
As things stand, the theme this time around will likely be the economy, professors said.
“I think the key thing is [Romney’s] got to continue to focus on the economy,” Grayson said. “He’s got to do a better job articulating what is Mitt Romney’s vision for the country. It’s going to be a right of center message.”
In his exit speech on Tuesday afternoon, Santorum declared “we are not done fighting” and that he would continue to help defeat Obama. The support for his party fell short of directly endorsing Romney.
The former Pennsylvania senator dropped out just two weeks shy of his home state’s primary, which political experts have begun to suspect could go to Romney. Though he did not definitively name a reason for dropping out, Santorum had recently taken a few days off from the campaign trail to care for his sick daughter and re-evaluate his campaign.
“Those who seek elective office are by and large realists. Rick Santorum...eventually concluded that [his] window of opportunity had passed,” Porter wrote. “Contesting the battle further was expensive and potentially damaging to [his] brand.”
Fellow Republican contenders Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul have pledged to stay in the race, but experts said that their candidacies are now more about spreading a message than actual electoral ambition.

At a panel discussion on the reorganization of Harvard’s library system, faculty members and library staff members voiced many of the concerns pertaining to librarians’ job security, the future quality of the library system, and communication and commitment from Mass. Hall that have all plagued the reorganization effort since the January announcement that the restructuring would involve staffing cuts.
During the discussion on Tuesday, University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 said that there had been “a series of catastrophic misunderstandings” during the reorganization process but assured the crowd that “those of us in the library take this [dialogue] very seriously.”
He said that “the impression [among staff] that there would be sudden, brutal, [and] massive layoffs” was not true. At this point, he said, administrators “don’t have any idea of what the size of the staff will be.”
More than four weeks after announcing that the library would shrink its workforce without revealing how many workers it would cut nor how it would select them, the University offered long-time employees a voluntary retirement package in February.
History professor Lisa M. McGirr called upon the University to think beyond financial cares when making decisions about the size of the staff.
“Harvard is, and should continue to be, more than that,” McGirr said. “Efficiency can be a good thing and doesn’t require layoffs—we should proceed with great care and caution.”
But the discussion on Tuesday covered topics beside the looming threat of involuntary layoffs which has sparked numerous protests on campus throughout the semester.
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Director Bill Jaeger, who was unable to attend the forum, said that he perceives the University’s message to have moved away from the subject of layoffs since the “stark announcement of January 19.”
“I think the ongoing conversation among the library staff is changing and is less concerned about avoiding layoffs and more concerned about other parts of the library organizational design that are also really important,” Jaeger said.
The conversation on Tuesday followed that tack.
Darnton acknowledged that stakeholders are concerned about service quality from the library and said he shared those worries.
“I was upset to see that services had declined in many ways,” he said.
But he said that the University’s support for the libraries has not decreased; if it had, he said, he would have resigned.
Janet Katz, a librarian on the panel, said she was specifically anxious about the cataloging of volumes in the near future.
“I know how excellent HOLLIS is,” Katz said about the library’s online catalog system, “and I just hate to think it would become any less.”
Panelist and classics professor Richard F. Thomas said he had been disappointed by the level of faculty and librarian involvement in the decision-making process thus far. “We need more than just conversations between the people who are putting [in] the system and librarians,” he said. “We need actual input from librarians who are willing to give it and have the expertise to give it. I think librarians and faculty embrace change, but that change has to be change that doesn’t diminish the quality of the libraries in all media.”

One of the two women injured in the U-Haul crash at the November Harvard-Yale Game tailgate party that killed a third woman filed a lawsuit last week seeking at least $15,000 in damages from the Yale undergraduate who was driving the vehicle and the rental truck company.
In a memorandum filed with the Superior Court of New Haven, Sarah Short, a Yale School of Management student, claimed that she has suffered from “severe painful and obvious injuries” since she was hit by a truck driven by Yale junior Brendan Ross at the tailgate party.
The crash also killed Short’s close friend, 30-year-old Salem resident Nancy Barry, and injured Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach.
In the court filing, Short, 30, listed five potential causes of her injuries, for which she said either Ross or the U-Haul Company of Connecticut should be held responsible—including the driver’s failure to honk his horn, the excessive speed at which he was driving, and the unsafe condition of the truck that he rented.
Ross, who had been transporting beer kegs to his fraternity’s tailgate party, was taken into police custody immediately after the accident and released that night. He registered as sober on a Breathalyzer test conducted at the scene.
Ross has not been charged with any crime, but New Haven Police Department spokesperson David Hartman said on Tuesday that charges may still be in the works. The investigation into the accident is closed, Hartman said, but the state attorney’s office will not determine whether to issue an indictment until transcripts of witness statements are made in four to six weeks.
According to Short’s complaint, which was filed by New Haven lawyer Michael A. Stratton, she underwent multiple surgeries after the collision. Her injuries included “severe and deep bone bruising,” “extensive soft tissue loss,” “severe scarring,” and “extreme pain.”
She has also struggled with the emotional repercussions of witnessing her close friend’s unexpected death and then confronting her own wounds.
The court document said that Short is seeking damages to compensate for the wages and time in school that she lost due to her injuries as well as the cost of her medical care.
The memorandum stated, “The plaintiff...suffered and will continue to suffer an overall impairment to her earning capacity and ability to carry on and enjoy all of life’s other activities.”
Short, Ross, and their respective attorneys could not be reached for comment on Tuesday evening.
In response to the fatal accident, Yale announced new tailgating regulations in January. In the future, tailgates at Yale will shut down at kick-off. Yale also decided to ban kegs and prohibit vehicles like U-Hauls from the student section of the tailgate.
Harvard instituted similar policies starting at the 2010 Harvard-Yale Game.

Speaking before a crowd of more than 400 people, University President Drew G. Faust discussed the evolving perceptions of the Civil War and the ties between war and the humanities at the Boston Public Library Tuesday evening.
“Most Americans have approached the Civil War anniversary with attitudes quite different than those who attended 50 years ago,” said Faust, pointing to the way in which the United States honored the centennial anniversary of the war in the 1960s. “Race has moved from the margins of Civil War history to the center.”
She broadened her discussion of the Civil War to include her explanation for human fascination with battles.
“It’s terrible, and yet we love it,” Faust said. “We must acknowledge both its horror and its attraction, if we hope to understand the difference, and the contradiction at the heart of its presence in human lives.”
Faust’s talk was the penultimate speech in a lecture series created as part of Harvard’s ongoing 375th anniversary celebrations to emphasize the ties between the University and the broader community. By the conclusion of the series, the University will have brought educational programming to all 34 Boston and Cambridge public libraries in the form of college prep classes, book readings, and speeches by notable Harvard faculty members and alumni.
Faust gave the inaugural talk in the series at the Cambridge Public Library in January. Other speakers in the series included Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Professors Maria Tatar and Steven Pinker.
President of the Boston Public Library Amy E. Ryan said that she thought Faust’s lecture Tuesday epitomized the mission of the BPL.
“This was so meaningful because there were people here from all walks of life, all of Boston, here to see President Faust,” Ryan said. “This is the sort of thing that breathes life into the mission of the library—the advancement of learning.”
Harper C. Sutherland ’14, who attended the event, said that the lecture was not what she was expecting.
“I thought it was going to be more based on the Civil War and not as much about war in general,” Harper said. “I think her book is more interesting.”
Isabelle Barnard, a visiting pre-frosh who accompanied Sutherland to the event, said she found the lecture to be  “fascinating.”
“Obviously, it’s always a plus when the president of the college is brilliant,” Barnard said.
Elizabeth Saltonstall, who attended the event, praised the accessibility of Faust’s lecture.
“She brought it alive in such a relevant way,” Saltonstall said. “People from all different walks of life could relate.”
Harvard Overseer and New York Times bestselling author Walter S. Isaacson ’74 will conclude the series with a lecture on Steve Jobs at the end of May.

Entering the ninth inning of its first-round Beanpot matchup Tuesday night, the Harvard baseball team had amassed a three-run lead over crosstown rival Boston College.
But the seemingly comfortable advantage nearly evaporated after a walk by junior pitcher Matt Doyle and two singles loaded the bases for the Eagles with just one out in the final frame.
With the tying run for BC (13-21, 4-11 ACC) on base, junior hurlers Andrew Ferreira and Zack Olson came through for the Crimson (6-22, 2-6 Ivy).
The duo struck out the only two batters they faced on the night, securing Harvard’s second straight berth in the Beanpot final with a 5-2 victory at LeLacheur Park in Lowell, Mass.
“All around it was a really well-played game,” junior third baseman Kyle Larrow said. “We got runs when we had to, we played good defense, and we pitched well. Something our team has been trying to do all year is to do all three things at the same time—we have to pitch, play defense, and hit. We were able to do that today.”
Harvard got the scoring started off early, jumping out to a two-run lead in the first inning of Tuesday’s contest. After sophomore left fielder Jack Colton and senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds got on base with a pair of singles, sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan drove them both home with a single down the left field line.
The Crimson was able to stretch its lead to three in the third frame, as McGuiggan found his way home on a fly out from senior catcher John Smart.
“Jake’s been absolutely tearing up the ball lately,” Olson said. “It seems around this time every year he starts to get hot. Right now, you feel like he’s one of the guys you want up at the plate to get a big hit.”
With freshman Matt Timoney starting on the mound for just the second time in his rookie campaign, BC got back within striking distance. Sophomore outfielder Tom Bourdon drove in two runs with a single and a double in the third and fifth innings, respectively, making the first-round Beanpot matchup a one-run game again.
But the two scores were all the Eagles could muster on the day. Timoney finished the game with three strikeouts in 7.1 innings pitched, and McGuiggan led the offensive charge for the Crimson, earning an impressive four hits in just five at-bats Tuesday night.
“Matt Timoney...threw really, really well,” Larrow said. “He kept us in the game the whole time.”
Rookie designated hitter Nick Saathoff also had a strong night, notching three hits of his own.
“This was a big game for [Saathoff] as a freshman,” Olson said. “We all know he’s got a really talented offensive bat. He needed to get a few at-bats out there to get into the rhythm of the college game, and I think now he’s really starting to get a handle on things. I think he’s going to be big for us throughout the rest of the year.”
Harvard returned BC’s fire in the next few innings, pushing its lead back up to three by the end of the ninth frame. In the top of the sixth, freshman Ethan Ferreira sent Saathoff home, coming up with a big single after his team had amassed two outs. Larrow followed suit in the ninth, driving in McGuiggan with a single to right field after the shortstop stole second base.
The Eagles—who have claimed an all-time high nine Beanpot titles since the tournament’s inception—have struggled recently against the Crimson, dropping two games within a week despite entering the 2012 season on a 15-game winning streak against Harvard.
“We felt like, talent-wise, we were on an equal playing field,” Olson said. “Both [last week and Tuesday night], I think we brought a little bit more intensity than BC. We had a little more focus on the little things, and it paid off with two wins.”
In Tuesday night’s other Beanpot matchup, UMass took down Northeastern, 4-1. The Minutemen will meet the Crimson on April 18 to compete for Boston-area bragging rights and the midseason championship title. For Harvard, a win against UMass would break a Beanpot championship drought stretching back to 2005—the longest such current streak among the four Beanpot-eligible teams.
“The win [over the Eagles] is huge,” Olson said. “It gives us a load of confidence going into this weekend…beating BC twice within a span of a week really gives us a lot of confidence for our conference play.”

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team surrendered the first goal of its Tuesday evening game at Harvard Stadium, but it wouldn’t make many mistakes from there.
Buoyed by four goals from freshman attackman Will Walker and the faceoff dominance of freshman midfielder Keegan Michel, the Crimson scored 16 unanswered goals, spanning all four quarters, and left visiting Quinnipiac (3-7, 2-0 NEC) all but helpless as it walked off with a dominant 18–4 win.
Tied at two with 4:30 to play in the first quarter, Harvard (6-5, 2-1 Ivy) unleashed one of its most impressive scoring runs of the season.
The streak began with sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp, who caught a pass from senior attackman Jeff Cohen and buried a shot in the back of the net. Will Walker added back-to-back goals within 20 seconds of one another to send the Crimson into the second quarter leading, 5-2.
The Harvard advantage only grew from there. Freshman midfielder Sean Mahon caught a pass at the top of the box, pump faked, and fired to put Harvard up four. Later, after a Quinnipiac score was waived off for a crease violation, tri-captain Kevin Vaughan scored on a mid-range shot, and Cohen scored back-to-back goals soon after to send the Crimson into the half up 9-2.
The onslaught continued in the third quarter. Walker completed a hat trick three minutes in after catching a pass from Vaughan. After a score from sophomore attackman Carl Zimmerman, Walker netted a fourth goal with five minutes remaining in the quarter to stretch the lead to 10. Eipp earned some style points by scoring on a behind-the-head shot soon after, and sophomore attackman Garrett Campbell scored his first goal of the season to send Harvard into the final frame comfortably ahead, 14-2.
The Crimson would add four goals in the fourth quarter, including freshman attackman Phillip Wagley’s first two collegiate goals. Quinnipiac scored twice in the waning minutes, but the outcome had long been decided.
“I thought we were sharp right from the beginning on offense,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “I’m really happy with the overall effort and energy.”
The Bobcats, who were held scoreless for two straight quarters and more than 40 minutes of play, took an early 1-0 lead on a third-minute goal from junior Brendan Wilbur. The Crimson responded with two straight goals of its own. Senior midfielder Terry White found the back of the net on a shot from outside, and senior midfielder Andrew Pataki scored his first goal of the season seconds after that.
Later in the quarter, a fortuitous bounce allowed the Bobcats’ Matt Kycia to pick up the ball in front of the net and tie the game at two, but it was all Harvard from there.
The Crimson dominated possession throughout the game thanks in large part to the efforts of Michel, who won every one of the game’s thirteen first-half faceoffs.
“Keegan has been huge for us all season,” Will Walker said.
“He was outstanding tonight in terms of getting possessions for us, really the MVP of the game” Wojcik added. “He’s been an integral part of this team.”
The Bobcats won only four of its 26 faceoffs on the night, but even when they did manage to get the ball, their offense struggled, getting off only 10 shots in the game to the Crimson’s 50. Plagued by dropped passes and turnovers, Quinnipiac could find no answer to Harvard’s defense.
“Our defense was organized and energized tonight,” Wojcik said. “We played well on the ball and off of it.”
It was a team effort on the offensive end as well for the Crimson, which saw three of its players record their first goals of the season. Eipp and Mahon added two goals apiece, and junior attackman Jack Walker also added a late goal.
Cohen, who netted two goals on Tuesday, was honored in a pre-game ceremony after breaking the 50-year-old Harvard record for career goals last Saturday at Cornell. The record was previously held by Dave Bohn ’61, who was in attendance Tuesday night.
The Crimson now looks ahead to an Ivy League matchup in Pennsylvania this Saturday, when it will face a struggling Quakers team that, according to Wojcik, plays among the nation’s most challenging schedules.
“We expect it to be a dog fight,” Wojcik said.
Harvard currently sits in third place in the Ivy League, one full game ahead of fifth-place Brown, which would be the last team left out of the Ivy League Tournament if the season ended today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last home game of their college careers, Harvard women’s water polo co-captains Shannon Purcell and Devan Kennifer bid farewell to Blodgett Pool in style. Kennifer outhustled two Hartwick defenders to score a crucial last-minute goal to send the game into overtime, and Purcell netted the game-winner with 44 seconds remaining in overtime to power the Crimson past the No. 20 Hawks, 12-11.
It was senior night at Harvard, and four-year players Purcell, Kennifer, Lizzie Abbott, and Monica Zdrojewski were honored in a ceremony before the game.
The senior class has racked up a record of 54-55, including a 17-15 mark last season, the program’s first season over .500 in six years.
The Crimson’s victory over Hartwick (23-10, 3-3 CWPA West) marks the first time Harvard (13-9, 4-1 CWPA South) has defeated the Hawks since their first matchup in 2001 and breaks a 27-game losing streak to Hartwick.
“It’s a big thing for our program. Hartwick’s a great team,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “They are very strong…. They’ve been in the top 20 for a long time for a reason. But it’s a regular season win, we still have a lot of work to do, [and] we still have five really good teams in our division that we have to play.”
The crowd was involved in the game early at Blodgett, creating an electric atmosphere. When Kennifer appeared in front of the stands, chants of ‘Ocho, Ocho’ reverberated throughout the pool.
“With the crowd being up there, I wanted to win it for them,” Kennifer said. “The crowd going nuts for us, just every time, again and again. That was such a huge kick.”
The Hawks struck first with a quick goal two minutes into the first period to put Hartwick up, 1-0. But the Crimson quickly struck back, capitalizing on a 6-on-5 to net a goal and tie the game up.
The first period featured ball-hawking defense from both sides that forced many missed scoring opportunities from both teams. The Hawks were able to tally two more points in the first period to come away with a 3-1 edge.
The second frame featured many more scoring displays than the first. Just 30 seconds into the second period, junior two-meter defender Elise Molnar bounced a shot in on a fast break to make the game 3-2 and junior attacker Aisha Price netted another goal two minutes into the period to tie the game up, 3-3.
Freshman goalie Ariel Dukes was active throughout the period, making several key saves. The three-time CWPA Defensive Player of the Week kept Harvard in the game with numerous blocked shots and stops, but the Hawks were able to capitalize on several costly Harvard turnovers to head into halftime up, 7-5.
At the start the second half, Hartwick netted two quick scores in the first two minutes to put the Hawks up, 9-5.
But after a timeout, the Crimson roared back with three goals of its own. Molnar broke free from her defender to score another fast break goal, and under two minutes later, Aisha Price found the back of the net on a 6-on-5 to make it 9-7 Hartwick.
Less than a minute later, Kennifer recorded stole the ball and gave it sophomore attacker Shayna Price, who is also a Crimson Sports comper, to snipe in a long-range goal.
While Harvard was able to narrow the lead and score, the Crimson was unable to stop the Hawks offense and allowed two more scores to end the third quarter with an 11-8 deficit.
“It was the last home game of the pool, [so] you have to leave it all in the pool,” Kennifer said. “We’ve come back from a lot more than [four goals down], and we were really pumped up. You have to think about it like it’s the beginning of the game, like it’s a 0-0 ballgame.”
The fourth period began with continued intense defensive pressure from both teams.
Aisha Price scored a quick goal to wake up the crowd and with three minutes left in the quarter, sister Shayna Price connected on a perimeter shot to make it 11-10.
Stingy defense from Harvard continued to bother Hartwick, with many Crimson players recording steals.
Following a crucial save from Dukes, Harvard was down one point with one minute to go, and with 30 seconds remaining, Kennifer was able to retrieve a Crimson turnover and force a game-tying goal into the net.
In the two overtime periods, Harvard had two goals overturned by the referees, once on a correctable error, and once on called foul.
“Getting those goals taken back and things that was tough,” Kennifer said. “But you have to look at it with perspective. If they take a goal away, we’ll just go score another one.”
The Crimson was able to find a way to win with help from Purcell and a raucous home crowd. With 44 seconds left in overtime, Purcell found the back of the net on a final goal to end the game 12-11.
“I think everyone on the team believes that we can play with anybody we get in the pool with this weekend and at [Eastern Division Championships],” Kennifer said, “Our momentum has changed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard softball team put up a total of 25 runs to sweep Rhode Island in its two-game series, 10-0 and 15-7. Each of the contests lasted just five innings, as Harvard took home both victories by mercy rule.
But the Crimson squad was unable to repeat its dominant performance this season, splitting yesterday’s doubleheader against the Rams (14-19, 2-4 A-10) at URI Softball Complex. Despite nabbing a 6-2 win in the first game, Harvard (20-10, 7-1 Ivy) failed to keep the rally going in the second contest and was ultimately defeated, 5-1.
“Overall, we had a pretty solid team effort,” said freshman first baseman Adrienne Hume. “We still have some things to work on, and I know we can be much stronger offensively. We have the ability to score a lot more runs than what we showed for today. We came away with the split but definitely could have taken both games.”
RHODE ISLAND 5, HARVARD 1
In the second game of the day, the Crimson fell into an early one-run hole and was unable to dig itself out, losing, 5-1.
For the first three innings of the contest, the Rhode Island defense silenced the Harvard bats, which currently lead the Ivy League with a batting average of .281.
Meanwhile, as the Rams’ infield was shutting out the Crimson, its offense was able to load up the scoreboard with runs.
Courtney Prendergast hit an RBI double in the first inning and Alison Hartzell homered in the second to give Rhode Island a 2-0 lead. The Rams then plated three more batters in the bottom of the third inning to put Harvard in a five-run deficit.
The Rhode Island rally finally ended in the fourth inning, when sophomore hurler Laura Ricciardone came in to replace freshman Gabrielle Ruiz on the mound. Ricciardone went on to pitch a scoreless three innings during which the Rams did not produce a single hit.
The Crimson tried to make a comeback at the top of the sixth inning but was only able to muster up a single run, when right fielder Shelbi Olson scored, unearned, on a throw to second base.
Harvard made one more scoring attempt in the seventh inning but came up empty.
“The team is left with a bitter taste in our mouths that the Rams were able to take one from us,” Ricciardone said. “We’ll carry that with us to [our conference matchup at] Yale this weekend.”
HARVARD 6, RHODE ISLAND 2
The first game of the doubleheader was a defensive battle with the Crimson ultimately coming out on top, 6-2.
Co-captain Rachel Brown was put to the test as soon as she got on the mound, as the first two batters of the Rhode Island offense roped back-to-back singles in the first inning. The third batter then popped out and Brown walked the cleanup hitter, loading the bases with only one out.
But last season’s Pitcher of the Year led Harvard safely out of the inning by striking out the next two hitters. Brown went on to fan a total of 14 batters in her seven innings pitched, bringing her career strikeout count to 157, the highest in the Ancient Eight.
Brown kept the momentum going in the second and third innings, and both squads were held scoreless until the top of the fourth, when sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange—the most recent Ivy League Player of the Week—ripped a two-run homer.
The Rams responded with a run in the bottom of the inning to decrease their deficit to a single run and make the score 2-1.
The Crimson regained a two-run lead in the fifth inning as Hume stole home on a wild pitch.
But Rhode Island continued to battle, bringing in an additional run that same inning to once again make it a one-run game, 3-2.
Harvard answered at the top of the sixth inning with a three-run rally, extending its advantage to four runs.
Lange was the first on base, advancing on a walk. Freshman Andrea Del Conte came in to pinch run for Lange and advanced to second on a fielding error. Shortly after, sophomore Allison Scott singled to center field to bring Del Conte home.
Freshman second baseman Katherine Lantz followed with a two-run homer to plate the final runs of the inning.
The Rams made an effort to spark up a comeback in the sixth and seventh innings but were unsuccessful, and the host team fell to the Crimson, 6-2.
“Overall I think the team played well today, but I definitely think we saw areas of our game that could be improved,” Lantz said. “The team is looking forward to working out these kinks this week at practice in order to come out on top against Yale this weekend.”

In a conflict which has expanded in the course of a single day to involve an unprecedented three Houses, a fourth House has now joined the alliance against Adams House. Led by a mysterious individual known only by the alias "General Mistie," Mather House Committee issued a "Decree to Save the Tree" to declare war against Adams if they continue hostilities against Currier House.
In the declaration, Mather warns Adams against making a rash decision in the matter due to the increasing number of Houses allied to Currier. The Decree also invoked Mather's aid to Adams House in recovering its gong from Kirkland House during the Great House War of 2004.
Mather concluded with an ultimatum to Adams to rescind its declaration of war by 11:59:59 on Wednesday evening. If Adams does not, Mather will issue a formal declaration of war.
We're sure that more will progress tonight and tomorrow. Stay tuned!

Winthrop House surprised campus today by declaring war on Lowell House. Their first grievance? The lack of swipe access to Lowell's back gate. Despite other House conflicts, this battle is so far limited to the two river Houses, and Winthrop has not stated its position in the on-going Adams-Currier conflict.
A declaration on Winthrop's House Facebook page detailed various reasons for the war against Lowell, ranging from the noise of the Lowell Bells to the dearth of broccoli in the dining hall. The color of the dining hall itself was another point of conflict, and Winthrop also expressed disapproval that "Lowell has incurred the wrath of the international community."
Winthrop also made the largest demands so far in the current conflict, demanding that students from Winthrop, Eliot, and Leverett be granted access to the back gate. They also demanded that the Lowell bells only be rung between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. on Sundays, and offered to enter an alliance with other River Houses to resolve the conflict.
In an ominous turn, the Declaration warned, "President and Commander-in-Chief Gregg Peeples is hereby authorized and directed to employ the entire naval, military, canine, and feline forces of Winthrop House and the resources of the Government to carry on war against the House of Lowell."
This is first war to strike Winthrop since the 2008 "War With Waves," following the flooding of Winthrop Dining Hall. Winthrop remained neutral in both the 2004 conflict and the 1999 Pfoho-Adams War. A formal response has yet to be issued by Lowell residents, although Lowell's House Masters, Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin, responded in an email message to Lowell residents that has since been forwarded around campus that "this is not the occasion for war."
"In the spirit of Gandhi, we respond: "Nonviolence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last article of my creed." and, again, "The pursuit of truth does not permit violence on one's opponent."
Stay tuned to Flyby for updates as they happen.

Relations continued to deteriorate between the Quad and the River on Wednesday evening as the Pforzheimer Department of Pfublic Safety issued a travel advisory to its residents regarding unnecessary travel to Houses currently in conflict with Currier.
"Please be advised that at 2:28 p.m. this afternoon, Winthrop House declared war on Lowell House," the advisory read. "We recommend that any Pfohosers who visit these active war zones practice extreme caution in avoiding sewage and cockroaches." The degree to which Pforzheimer and other Quadlings are heeding the advisory is currently unclear.
As always, more updates to come.

Henry A. Kissinger '50 sent shockwaves across campus on Wednesday by declaring his support for Adams House, where he lived as an undergraduate in Claverly Hall. Kissinger, who is known for his eight years at the helm of American foreign policy and for being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973, spoke in Sanders Theatre in conjunction with the 375th anniversary celebration.
In response to a question about his views on the interhouse conflict, Kissinger said, "I support Adams House."
Historically, Adams has received little to no support from those outside the House. Besides a tenuous alliance with Mather in the 2004 conflict against Kirkland, Adams House otherwise has worked alone; it did not form alliances in the 1999 Pfoho-Adams War. Kissinger's allegiance to the House may help to spur Adam's momentum.
Natalie T. P. Cheng '15 contributed to the reporting of this story.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 16
An earlier version of this blog post incorrectly stated that Henry A. Kissinger '50 spoke at the Institute of Politics. In fact, he spoke in Sanders Theatre.
