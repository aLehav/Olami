Now did I ever tell you about the time that I met Tommy Tune? Oh that was a great show. Right over here in the Colonial, can you believe that? You must go see a show. I have a clipping I saved about it somewhere at home. And I met James Taylor. Never did like James Taylor myself. No, he was bald. And Paul Newman—you know he wrote Lisa after she named her horse after him? Wrote her a letter himself! Imagine that. But now I haven’t finished telling you about Tommy Tune at the Colonial.
You know I can remember this city back seventy years ago? On Friday nights we used to go cruising up and down the streets, all the boys in their nice cars. And we went on dates, oh sure. Big groups of us—boys and girls. But my best boyfriend was Frank Blow. That was before Bill of course. And he has a widow now. But we wrote each other for years. For years and years. Oh Frank Blow, forever. Always.
Now what do you think that is out over there? It looks like the harbor to me. I’m not sure. I think it’s a harbor. Never seen a harbor in all my sixty years here but that’s what I think it is. I wonder how the ships get this far in.
Oh no, oh dear. I think I have to go. How do you know when you have to go? How will I know? We should probably call someone. Should we call? I just don’t know anymore how to tell. This always seems to happen. Do you think we should call? I think maybe it’s passed. Maybe let’s call soon. Yes, I think I will have to go soon.
You know it’s my birthday this weekend. Eighty-five. My whole family is coming for my birthday. Even Lisa—she’s the one from Texas. She’s the one calling so many times every week. They will all be here and I will be eighty-five years old.
When are they getting in? Where are Lisa and Jonathan and Leslie? I do wish they would get their arrangements in order. They need to get their schedules aligned. I’m really not sure there’s time. When is anyone coming?
It was nice visiting with you today but I feel so tired. I think I’ll rest. But I do hope they get here soon. It hurts and hurts. I wish I could just go home. When I get outa here, first thing I wanna do is take a drive up those mountains over there so I can take a look at where I’ve been looking from. A harbor. Where has it been all this time? I can’t imagine how I’ve missed it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering Saturday afternoon’s contest, the Cornell field hockey team, led by reigning Ivy League Player of the Week Hannah Balleza, had won four straight games. The Big Red’s momentum seemed to carry over into the first half against Harvard, as Cornell took control early, not allowing a Crimson shot until the game’s 29th minute.
Following its slow start, Harvard (3-9, 1-3 Ivy) fought back, but Cornell (6-6, 3-1 Ivy) was again able to establish control with three goals in the final frame en route to a 4-0 victory, marking the Crimson’s fourth straight loss at Jordan Field.
“I think they caught us on our heels,” sophomore Noel Painter said. “We weren’t able to respond in time to make a difference in the first half, and, unfortunately, in the game, we weren’t able to come back and counter all the goals that they scored.”
Balleza netted two goals on the day. The junior has now accounted for seven of the Big Red’s last 10 scores.
“She’s a phenomenal player,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “You don’t see many players in the Ivy League that can match speed and skills.”
Freshman Taylor Standiford contributed two goals for Cornell as well, her first two of the season. In the game’s 12th minute, Standiford’s opened the scoring, as she took a penalty corner from Balleza and fired a low hard shot past Crimson goalie and co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos into the left side of the cage.
With the Big Red controlling the pace for most of the opening 25 minutes, Harvard began to assert itself towards the end of the half. Junior Rachael Rosenfeld had a chance on an open goal, but the play was called back due to a foul.
The Crimson drew a few penalty corners in the closing minutes and took the last three shots of the half, but could not convert to knot the score before halftime.
“I think when you see the clock counting down, you start to feel that you have to actually do something,” Painter said. “That’s what we need to do for the entire game, for seventy minutes, and that’s something that we’re working on.”
Harvard was able to withstand the Cornell’s press until midway through the second half, when Balleza was able to put one in the cage after a scramble in front of the home team’s goal.
She added another ten minutes later as senior Kat DiPastina drove down the right side and passed it up from the baseline to Balleza by the right side of the circle. The junior put the visitors up, 3-0, with a shot to the far left side of the cage.
Off a pass from senior midfielder Genevieve Collins, Standiford added a late goal off a shot from the left side of the circle past the diving Tassopoulos.
Down 4-0, the Crimson increased its pressure in the remaining minutes, but still could not slip one past junior goalie Carolyn Horner, who entered the game with the fourth best save percentage in the nation at .822.
Tassopoulos, who had a .776 save percentage coming into the game, good enough for ninth in the nation, finished with four saves. She is now third all time in career saves for Harvard and ten shy of 500 in her four years with the Crimson.
Despite the lopsided score, Harvard outshot the Big Red, 9-8, in the second half to finish with 12 shots to Cornell’s overall 15. Each team also had six penalty corners apiece, but the Crimson was unable to convert, suffering its third shutout of the year.
“On game days, this team is still feeling a little bit hesitant in decision making,” van Herwaarden said. “That allowed Cornell to apply easy pressure on us and then it becomes very difficult to get through.”
According to van Herwaarden, the Big Red was able to transition to defense quickly because of Harvard’s difficulty controlling the ball.
“We didn’t put in enough fight,” van Herwaarden said. “I thought we were pretty evenly matched with a team like Cornell…. This team has been showing incredible stuff in practice, and right now it’s time to translate it toward the field on game days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 1:41 to go in the second quarter of the Harvard football team’s game against Bucknell Saturday, senior Kyle Juszczyk caught a pass at the Bison 30-yard line as the defense closed in.
Bucknell’s Jordan Dudas, Ryan Morgan, and Jaylen Amaker swarmed the tight end and did their best to halt him in his tracks. But one by one, each defender’s effort proved futile, as Juszczyk shed Dudas and then pinballed off Morgan and Amaker before emerging out of the attempted gang tackle with his legs still churning. He reached the 20, where he stiff-armed the Bison’s Derrick Palmer to the ground with ease, steamrolling into the end zone for a 59-yard score while leaving the four Bucknell defenders on the ground behind him.
"As a little kid, I was told it will hurt less if you hit them before they hit you, so I just tried to stick by that," Juszczyk said with a smile.
"When the coaches watch film, we always kid Kyle that he’s like a comet—there’s always debris in his path," Crimson coach Tim Murphy added.
Just like Juszczyk, the rest of the Harvard offense could often not be stopped in Saturday’s 35-7 win. The victory extended the Crimson’s winning streak to 14 games dating back to last year—the longest streak in Division I—and Harvard’s 205 points through five games is the most of any Crimson football team since 1892.
Juszczyk finished with two catches for 79 yards on the day, giving him over 1,200 yards in his career—good for a spot on Harvard’s all-time top 10 list.
His dynamic fellow tight end, junior Cameron Brate, registered five catches for 57 yards and a touchdown. The score came with 7:07 left in the first half, when senior quarterback Colton Chapple found Brate on a low slant over the middle for a 14-yard score.
"[Juszczyk is] going to get [an NFL] look," Bucknell coach Joe Susan said. "And the other tight end [Brate]—those body types are so hard to find."
BOLTIN’ COLTON
Chapple threw for 189 yards and the two scores before being pulled with a big lead in the third quarter for the third straight game. But the quarterback did most of his damage on the ground, running for a career-high 120 yards and two touchdowns.
"I feel like [my scrambling] helps our offense get into more of a rhythm," Chapple said. "If they see plays break down, and I’m able to get some positive yards out of it...that gives us some momentum, gives us shorter third downs, and keeps the chains moving."
Late in the first quarter, Chapple’s legs orchestrated a drive by themselves. Starting at the Bucknell 27 after a fumble recovery by safety Jaron Wilson, Chapple rushed for three yards on first down. Following an incompletion, the quarterback found himself with a wide-open left side of the field on third and seven and took advantage, scrambling for 18 more. He capped the drive by running the option with senior halfback Treavor Scales, keeping it himself and scoring a six-yard touchdown untouched to put Harvard up, 7-0.
"He’s so athletic and so poised in the pocket," Susan said. "He has that clock in his head that you need, and when it breaks down, he’s a threat to make plays with his feet."
Chapple also scored Harvard’s final touchdown of the game when off play-action, he found a hole in the defense and sprinted 59 yards down the right sideline for the score. It was Harvard’s third straight touchdown of 55 yards or more, following freshman Andrew Fischer’s 58-yard double reverse and Juszczyk’s 59-yard reception.
"There seems to be a running joke on the team that everyone’s shocked at how athletic I look out there," Chapple said.
FOUR-TIFIED
The Harvard front four also dominated throughout the evening, recording six sacks—by six individual players—and 12 tackles for loss.
"[Zach Hodges, John Lyon, Nnamdi Obukwelu], those guys pose matchup problems that you have to take into account in your protections," Susan said. "We started to adjust the protections as we went, but they are [so] good in terms of their ability to create straight-line rush, and they’re excellent in their movement and twist game, which really poses problems."
Until Bucknell’s final drive—when it scored a touchdown against Harvard’s second-team defense with 59 seconds remaining—the Crimson held the Bison to -1 rushing yards on 30 attempts. Bucknell’s starting running back, Jeremiah Young, was limited to 29 yards on 16 carries on the evening—just 1.8 yards per attempt.
“You won’t run the ball on us,” Hodges said. “That’s our job, to not let teams run the ball.”
Hodges paced Harvard with 3.5 tackles for loss, giving him a team-high 11 on the season. His 1.1 sacks per game is the sixth-best mark in the FCS.
“There’s always a difference in the athleticism between an offensive line and a defensive line, and that was obvious today,” Susan said. “That’s the best defensive line in terms of performance that I’ve seen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With this year’s installment of the Heptagonal Championships just two weeks away, the Harvard cross country team had its last chance to square off against non-conference competition this past weekend. The Crimson competed in two invitationals: the elite Wisconsin Adidas Invitational and the less competitive Princeton Invitational.
At the Wisconsin invite, Harvard’s pair of junior standouts, Maksim Korolev and James Leakos, led the men to a 28th-place finish out of 45 teams. The Crimson women relied on its depth and tight pack to earn a 23rd-place finish out of 48 squads.
At Princeton’s invitational, the Crimson men’s and women’s teams finished second and 10th, respectively.
WISCONSIN ADIDAS INVITATIONAL
Harvard toed the line against a number of the nation’s most storied cross country teams on Friday at the University of Wisconsin’s Thomas Zimmer Championship Course. The fourth-annual Wisconsin Adidas Invitational attracted teams from across the country, including the first, fourth, and fifth-ranked men’s teams and the second-ranked women’s squad.
In the end, it was No. 8 Stanford who took home the men’s team title, with No. 5 Iowa State topping the women’s field.
“There’s no question that this was the best [field] we’ve faced all year,” Saretsky said. “It was really, really incredible competition. In some ways, I think it might even be more competitive than the national meet with the sheer depth and volume of the race.”
Despite a strong outing by Ivy League standards, the Crimson men found itself in the bottom half of the team standings, racking up 655 points en route to a 28th-place finish. Korolev, who was held out of competition at the Paul Short Invite on Sept. 28 after winning the Harvard-Yale dual meet earlier this year, was once again the squad’s frontrunner. The junior placed 18th after covering the eight-kilometer course in 23:44. He was the first Ivy runner to cross the line, finishing three seconds ahead of Columbia senior Mike Murphy.
“I think Maks did a great job of executing the plan,” Saretsky said. “He did a good job of being patient and being towards the back of the front pack. Through 5k, he was in a position to really move up and establish himself as one of the best distance runners, not just in the Ivy League, but in the entire NCAA Division I.”
Leakos, whom Korolev ran down in the final stretch at Harvard-Yale, was the team’s next runner, coming in 36th place with a time of 23:57. Among Ancient Eight competitors in the race, Leakos finished fourth.
But after Leakos, a costly 43 seconds elapsed before another Crimson competitor came in. With over 150 runners having crossed the finish line after Leakos, the team’s third runner, freshman Tom Purnell, earned 188th place with a time of 24:40. Junior Kurt Ruegg, who led the team at the Paul Short meet, and freshman Billy Gaudreau, rounded out the scoring for Harvard, coming in 205th and 208th place, respectively.
The Crimson women earned a higher finish than the men, relying on the same strategy that has worked for the squad all year long: packing up.
Paced by junior Emily Reese, Harvard’s first four finishers crossed the finish line in a 14-second span. Reese, who is the latest in a string of different frontrunners for the Crimson, covered the six-kilometer course in 20:40, which was good for 70th place.
“One of the strengths of our women’s team right now is the interchangeability of our top five,” Saretsky said. “It’s exciting to see how competitive they are and how they continue to improve week in and week out.”
PRINCETON INVITATATIONAL
While the Harvard squads’ top competitors were in the Badger State, a number of the team’s other runners traveled to Princeton to face off against some local competition.
Senior Sean Pohorence led the way for the men’s team with a time of 24:48, good for 18th place overall. The other four Crimson scoring runners were just behind the senior, giving Harvard an unusually low six-second pack time.
“We started off the race a little bit disconnected,” Pohorence said. “But once we got linked up in the middle, it was easy to keep that going because we’re so used to seeing each other in workouts at practice.”
The men’s team’s point total of 110 was good for second place, topping Ancient Eight foes Cornell and Princeton, who finished in seventh and 14th place, respectively. Led by freshman Selena Pasadyn, the Crimson women scored 283 points and finished in 10th place at the Princeton Invite. Columbia took home the team title, tallying just 83 points on the day.
“As a team, I think we showed just what we’re capable of,” Saretsky said. “There’s a lot of excitement, and confidence, and great momentum moving into the Heps in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Overtime has not been kind to the Harvard men’s soccer team. After knotting the score at one in the second half, the Crimson’s comeback attempt was cut short when No. 19 Brown notched a golden goal in the 97th minute to take a 2-1 win.
The loss dropped Harvard (1-7-3, 0-2-1 Ivy) to 0-2-3 in overtime contests.
Brown (9-1-2, 2-0-1) wasted little time finding the back of the net in the extra period, as sophomore forward Ben Maurey centered the ball to senior defender Dylan Remick in the box just over six minutes into the extra period, who then powered the ball into the upper middle of the net.
“I thought we did a really good job of just battling in general,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “Brown is a team that likes to test the other team…. They like to challenge you and see how tough you are. They’ll make the game ugly, they’ll make the game physical, and they’ll try to get into your head. I thought we did a very good job of responding to that and throwing it right back at them.”
In the opening 20 minutes, the Bears supplied offensive pressure, taking five shots and earning three corner kicks. Harvard’s first shot came in the 23rd minute when freshman forward Jake Freeman rocketed the ball into senior goalkeeper Sam Kernan-Schloss’ hands.
Brown responded by putting the first point on the scoreboard fifteen minutes later. Junior forward Voltaire Escalona crossed the ball to senior midfielder Bobby Belair, who then executed a diving header to put the ball in the net. The Bears ended the period outshooting the Crimson, 11-6.
“We made small mistakes with not paying attention, not making that extra rush to get back,” senior forward Zack Wolfenzon said. “We’re almost there.”
Less than two minutes into the second half, Harvard came back to tie up the score off an unassisted goal by Freeman. The rookie dribbled it through the Brown defense and drilled a shot into the lower left corner of the net to score his second goal of the season.
“At the second half, we came out and were like ‘Hey, this is our season, and we got to come back and score a goal,’” Friedman said.
In the second half, freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez was strong in the net, saving six shots. Although the Crimson outshot the Bears, 7-6, in the second period, the Harvard offense was not able to capitalize on another attempt, and the match moved into overtime.
“I thought we had more chances and clearer chances in the second half,” Wolfenzon said. “We could’ve put the game away.”
Heading into overtime with the score 1-1 the Bears pressured offensively and had two corner kicks in the first three minutes of play.
Harvard had a chance in the 94th minute, but Freeman’s attempt went wide.
In the 97th minute, Maurey passed the ball to Remick who placed the ball over the head of Mendez to secure the win for Brown.
“We had a few small mistakes on both sides of the ball,” Wolfenzon said. “Both of their goals could have been avoided with maybe a little more focus and a bit more communication. They scored two great goals, but I think we need to be a little more tuned in. We really had a chance to win that game.”
Overall the Bears outshot the Crimson, 22-13, but Harvard edged out Brown on corner kicks, 6-5. Mendez registered eight saves and Freeman had six shots for the match.
With the loss, Harvard dropped to 1-7-3 on the year.
“It’s tough to talk about our record because we’re 1-7-3, but I don’t think it speaks to how good we are as a team,” Friedman said. “I think we played one of the toughest schedules in the country. We played every big-time team on the East Coast and two big-time teams on the West Coast. We’re a good team, but it’s just tough when we’re not getting the results.”
“We have an unbelievably talented group of kids,” Wolfenzon said. “We’re all behind coach [Carl] Junot and the rest of the coaching staff 100 percent. We like what they’re doing; we like the way we are playing in practice. It’s fun, and we’re having a good time.”

In this mini-series, Flyby profiles one of the seven fall 2012 IOP Fellows each week. This week: Sonal R. Shah.
You  may have seen IOP fellow Sonal R. Shah around campus at Harvard  sporting events as she indulges her passion for all things athletic. But  you can also join Shah in another setting this semester; every Thursday  from 4 to 5:30 p.m. her study group meets in room L166 at the IOP.  
 Shah  says that the IOP fellowship came at exactly the right moment in her professional life. "It was  perfect timing because I really wanted to take some time off and figure  out what I was going to do next, but at the same time stay connected,"  she said.
 
While  Shah may be unsure of where she is headed after this semester, her  previous list of jobs is full of well-known names and accomplishments.  Born in Mumbai, India and raised in Houston, Texas, Shah received her  masters in Economics from Duke University and then headed to Washington  D.C. where she worked for the Treasury Department under the Clinton  administration, doing work that took her all over the world.
 
In  1995, after bombing had devastated Sarajevo, Shah worked with the  treasury there to create a central banking system for the region.  Through working in Sarajevo and dealing with conflict, Shah learned the  importance of compromise and bringing together a group to solve  problems. "You couldn't go into a post-conflict situation and pick  winners. You had to bring everyone to the table to figure out  solutions," she said.
 
In 2002, after working in government for seven years, Shah decided to pursue a different path. She founded the non-profit Indicorps with her brother and sister.
 
"It's  basically a peace corps for Indians with the idea that if you wanted to  understand your identity as a diaspora, the best way to do it is  through service," she said.
 
Shah's passion for creating change would later land her in jobs at Goldman Sachs, Google, and the Technology, Innovation, Government Reform group of President Obama's Transition Board. 
 
Her  experiences in other countries and her jobs in both the public and  private sectors taught her to think about global issues and interactions  with a new perspective.
 
"Both  at the corporate level and the non-profit level, we think globally," she said.
 
In her study group, "Social Innovation: Impact on Politics,"  Shah focuses on the politics of technology, the use of technology in  elections, and how technology can be harnessed to encourage greater  participation in the governing process itself.
 
"I  think that democracy is much bigger than an election. It has to be very  much about people participating in a process," Shah said.
 
As  part of her study group, Shah will discuss the 2012 election, which she  believes poses a clear difference in terms of the two possible  outcomes. 
 
"There's a very clear difference in my mind as to what vision you want from this  election. Do you think that the government has a role to play that can  do good? I do."

When you've found yourself suffering at the hands of melancholia, odds are, someone has offered you the sage advice "chin up!" And, odds are, the falsely cheery phrase elicited an exponential increase in your irritation. However, the next time life seems to be taking a toll on your mood, you might find it helpful to adhere to that suggestion, as it's now supported by scientific research.
Harvard Business School's Amy J. C. Cuddy, in collaboration with Columbia University's Dana R. Carney and Andy J. Yap, has conducted some intensive research delving into this subject. After experimentation involving 42 subjects (16 male and 26 female) who were randomly assigned to two treatments—one, a high power, "chin up" pose, and the other, a low power, slouchy pose—Cuddy, Carney, and Yap drew some definitive conclusions.
The results were self-evident. Maintaining a high power pose directly caused a dramatic increase in testosterone, a hormone traditionally associated with a sense of power, and an equally dramatic decrease in cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. "Posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes," states the study. "And these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices."
There is a reason that every leader from Napoleon to Alexander the Great to that obnoxiously charismatic guy who beat you in the race for class president strutted around with flawless posture. Not only does the power pose make others more likely to follow you, but also it makes you more likely to believe in yourself.

It's recruiting season, and that means suits, resumes—and racism?
In a blog post published Saturday evening, a writer for The Harvard Voice listed a catalog of satirical stereotypes about people who attend on-campus recruiting events for finance and consulting jobs.
Four were mostly inoffensive snark—"the ass-kisser," "the final club bro," "the interview selection mistake," and "the hipster." The fifth, however, drew some angry attention—"the Asian."
The writer described the Asian interviewee:
"You can always spot the Asian contingent at every pre-interview reception. They dress in the same way (satin blouse with high waisted pencil skirt for girls, suits with skinny ties for boys), talk in the same sort-of gushy, sort-of whiny manner, and have the same concentrations and sky-high GPAs. They're practically indistinguishable from one another, but it’s okay. Soon, they will be looking at the same Excel spreadsheets and spend their lunch talking about their meaningful morning conversations with the helpdesk of Bloomberg. Uniqueness is overrated when you make six-figure salaries."
After Harvard students immediately expressed outrage at the blog's language via social media, the editors of The Voice—a student life magazine that operates the blog Very Noice—removed all comments and blocked further responses to the article, changed the byline from "The Voice Staff” to “Anonymous," and replaced "the Asian" with a rewritten paragraph on "the super-interviewee."
At that time, the editors posted a note apologizing for the potentially offensive content. “Though the article was written by an anonymous contributor, we have removed the inappropriate content because it is not in line with The Voice's mission of promoting satirical, yet inclusive, content,” the note said.
They posted a note below that from the writer, which said, "Clearly, I've been censored, which in itself is an interesting reflection on free speech in America. If you couldn’t tell that this article was satire, then we have bigger problems than me being 'offensive.' (If you are curious to know what the censored stereotype is, just take a quick look around the room. JK!)"
The anonymous writer's note was later removed.
All five posts on Very Noice since May have been written under the bylines "The Voice Staff" or "Some Dude."
April A. Sperry '13, listed on The Voice's website as one of two presidents and editors-in-chief of the publication last school year, declined to comment. Her co-president and editor Michelle B. Nguyen '13 could not immediately be reached on Sunday afternoon.

Come tomorrow, the number of people taking Harvard courses will grow by over 100,000.
Monday is the first day of school for HarvardX—a platform through which the University offers online versions of Harvard courses.
More than 100,000 students have registered for HarvardX courses thus far, Harvard told the Boston Globe.
HarvardX currently offers two courses—CS50x: "Introduction to Computer Science I" and PH207x: "Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Health Research." Each has no prerequisites and is an online adaptation of the courses offered through, respectively, Harvard College and Harvard School of Public Health.
Upon passing CS50X or PH207X, users earn a certificate issued under the name HarvardX.
HarvardX is the University’s contribution to edX,  a joint non-profit virtual learning initiative run by Harvard, MIT, and University of California, Berkeley.
Harvard and MIT announced the creation of edX this past May, pledging $30 million each in support of the venture. UC Berkeley joined in late July.
While BerkeleyX and MITx classes for this school year began as early as September, tomorrow is the first day of both Harvard courses.
When it was first announced in May, University President Drew G. Faust described edX as an initiative that "opens the possibility for transformation through education to learners around the globe."
"[EdX is] a partnership that will change our relationship to knowledge and learning," she said.
