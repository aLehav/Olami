After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What an incredibly lovely and wrenching hour of television. We’ve spent week after week dwelling on the submerged pain of all these women, and in “You Get What You Need,” everything explodes in grand fashion. We finally see the infamous trivia night—it’s weirdly opulent, and the blue and purple lighting makes it all feel like a fever dream—and we learn what happened on those stairs. Perry’s the dead body, impaled on a bit of rebar after Bonnie pushed him off Celeste to keep him from killing her. Jane and Renata and Madeline, all involved in the struggle, lie to protect Bonnie, and no one goes to jail. Also, just prior to Celeste’s beating, Jane realizes that Perry is her rapist and Ziggy’s father.
As the solution to a mystery, it’s a bit imperfect. It seems unlikely that out of everyone at the party, only Bonnie would know to follow Celeste and Perry, and it’s especially strange that Jane had apparently never met Perry before. And, of course, their convergence at a single school in Monterey strains credulity. Then again, none of that really matters, because this show never really pretended to be a whodunit. What matters is the moving visual poetry of Jane realizing who Perry is: Madeline looks at Jane, realizes what’s happening, and looks at Celeste, who then looks back at Perry. It’s only a handful of glances, but it contains a horrifying revelation, a profound expression of friendship and mutual understanding, and a painful statement about the nature of abuse. Celeste believes Jane instantly, and she doesn’t even seem surprised. Making Perry Jane’s rapist, and making Celeste’s son Amabella’s tormentor, finishes off one of the show’s central ideas about domestic violence—it’s never just hurting one person.
The final scene, that of all the women and their children enjoying the beach, further rounds out the show’s thinking about men and women. Without the toxic presence of male viciousness—definitely Perry, but also Nathan and Ed and Joseph in milder ways— everyone finds themselves free to wander around in a utopia of maternal solidarity and care. It’s a continuation of the moment when all the main women instinctively put aside their issues with one another to protect Celeste, to fight off a man with evil intentions. Granted, the pastel paradise idea might feel a little over-neat, and it certainly cuts off any full resolution of Madeline’s storyline, but it’s a really beautiful vision that encapsulates so much of the show’s previous work.
And this show did a lot of work. It managed an array of different characters and storylines and kept them all operating at a high level of aesthetic and intellectual quality; it also treated clichéd subject matter with unusual clarity, warmth, and empathy. We started with upscale “Desperate Housewives,” and we ended up with an astonishingly thoughtful depiction of therapy, marriage, parenting, female friendship, and stay-at-home mothering. We also got a show that remained wonderfully radical in its thinking about gender—in its investigation into the many kinds of ways that men hurt women, in its focus on women knowing and talking to one another. Of course, we also got Nicole Kidman doing some of the best work she’s ever done. May the Emmys rain down upon her.
So, in summary: the show maintained a truly impressive level of quality all the way through. In its writing, cinematography, and acting—especially in the case of Celeste and Perry’s relationship—it set new standards for the genre. And if Nicole Kidman in particular does not win all possible awards and adoration for her performance, she’ll have been absolutely robbed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Americans” is doing its best to juggle a number of plotlines in its fifth season. From Paige’s emulation of her parents’ darker sides to the increasing conflict between the Jennings and their ability to maintain their false identities, from Oleg’s trials and tribulations in Moscow to Stan’s clashes with the F.B.I. and C.I.A., from an American plot to wage war on Soviet grain to Philip’s Russian son trying to make his way to America— there’s a lot going on. That makes for great storytelling, but it can also make for particularly confusing episodes when the directors choose to advance too many of them at once.
Episode four of season five is one of those episodes. It’s still good, but there are a lot of scene changes in the episode that happen very quickly. Another level of confusion is introduced by the Jennings’ travel over the course of the episode, which splits its focus between Paige and the Jennings in Washington, Oleg in the U.S.S.R., and the operations the Jennings are running in Topeka, Kansas. Rapid switches from one of these scenes to the next occur throughout the episode and make it difficult for the viewer to follow any one thread. The show has done this before, but it’s frustrating to see it return at a time when the series should be gathering steam, as this is the second to last season of the show.
Though hard to follow, this episode does do a great job of developing these threads. I wrote in weeks past about the increasing tension between the Jennings’ private life and their work, and this is brought to a head as Gabriel assigns them to work on seducing executives of AgriCorp, the nondescript technology company helping produce grain-destroying bugs for secret U.S. operations. The only issue? These executives live in Topeka, Kansas, which would require the Jennings to fly there almost every week, and put strain on their relationships in D.C. Gabriel shoots down their concerns, and the Jennings return to their car with a new assignment. Philip deadpans, “Think we’re gonna get fired?” Elizabeth turns to him: “That’s not funny.” Philip responds, “I know.”
And, as we see, it really is a job—just not the kind you survive being fired from. As Philip and Elizabeth commute back and forth, they talk about their work like an office job. When Philip returns from his (unsuccessful) mission, he complains about how dull it is; “It’s promising if I don’t die from boredom first.” When Elizabeth returns from her mission, Philip is waiting, dinner’s in the fridge, and they casually discuss her attempt to seduce another man to gain intelligence on a secret ecological attack against their home country. It’s absurd, and the Jennings are clearly perturbed by the intrusion of their work on their lives. But they still keep seducing, murdering, and lying their way to state secrets.
As for Stan and Oleg, they remain tragically moral characters in the immoral world of “The Americans.” Paige and the Jennings, though at times morally troubled by their actions, continue their work. Yet despite the morally tumultuous journey Stan and Oleg took through the first four seasons, they continue to display an adherence to basic decency. Indeed, Stan puts his career and, potentially, his life on the line by threatening to go public and confesses to the unlawful murder of a Soviet man. Such a confession would cause massive public scandal, as proof of the government wielding unchecked lethal force against unarmed people, and also likely result in Stan’s being fired—perhaps in the way Philip alluded to in the show’s opening moments. All this for the enemy, for no other reason than that his moral compass will not allow him to stand idly by while Oleg is blackmailed. Whether or not the news will ever reach Oleg, whose mother tells him “do what you have to do to survive,” remains to be seen; of course, it’s unlikely that the C.I.A. will tell him.
Even so, Oleg faces his own problems. He continues pressuring a corrupt grocer along with the assistance of an experienced prosecutor. Once they obtain the name of her supplier, though, he has to confront the lack of moral flexibility in the Soviet system. In a clear parallel to Stan’s dilemma in the U.S., Oleg is perturbed by his government’s willingness to throw aside morality in the name of efficiency. Oleg, whose own brother was killed in Afghanistan, takes issue with his bosses’ plan to leverage the corrupt supplier’s son, who is deployed in the region, to force him to cooperate. He appeals to his director, suggesting that they find another way: “It’s not about being soft. It’s about doing the decent thing.” The director scoffs at him: “The decent thing is what’s best for our country.” In Stan and Oleg, we see men of two nations trying to do what is morally correct and being told that what is in the best interest of their country is the opposite. Here, as I wrote last week, is the central thesis of “The Americans.” If neither country will do what is right over what is tactically correct, then what are they really fighting for?

After several bombs destroy the Jeffersonian Institute’s lab in a fiery explosion, forensic anthropologist Temperance “Bones” Brennan (Emily Deschanel) loses her primary skill—her ability to think critically—in the series finale of “Bones.” She quietly but dramatically says, “Something is wrong with me” to her husband, an FBI agent named Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz). Thus begins the end of Fox’s 12-season-long criminal drama. The series finale of the show offers emotional tension through music and nostalgia, but fails to deliver fully because of its fast pace.
The main storyline of the episode is the search for revenge-seeking antagonist Mark Kovac (Gerard Celasco), who tries to kill Booth and those dear to him. This plotline is interrupted by the personal storylines—Angela Montenegro’s (Michaela Conlin) fear for her unborn baby, Bones’s mental setback, and Camille Saroyan (Tamara Taylor) and Arastoo Vaziri’s (Pej Vahdat) wedding. All the sidebars provide a way to tie up previous plot holes and issues presented earlier in the season. However, the Kovac storyline keeps the show’s formula—forensic anthropologists using their expertise to solve crimes—pleasantly consistent until the very end.
The music sets two opposing atmospheres—one of emotional intensity and the other of bittersweet reminiscence. The dialogue takes a backseat to fast-paced, strong, loud music in several action scenes. I the first scene after the explosion the music is pregnant with tense emotion, creating suspicion and unease. This heightens the stakes, introducing the possibility that Bones may never again be able to do the work that defines her. In contrast, soft and sweet melodies create a bittersweet atmosphere in moments of nostalgia. This style of sound plays while the characters are sifting through old mementos, talking about good old times, and thinking about future prospects.
By uprooting Bones’s identity through a brain injury, the show allows her to think about what is most important to her—her intelligence or her relationships. When testing her brain’s capability,  Bones says to the interns, “I remember the day each of you was hired.” Despite not being able to sustain complex thought, Bones realizes she can still remember the pivotal life events of those closest to her: Arastoo’s engagement, Clark Edison’s (Eugene Byrd) pride in his published book, and Jessica Warren (Laura Spencer) teaching her how to chirp. Past events are further explored when characters search through sentimental items such as a dolphin necklace, plaque, and rubber band ball, offering the audience a chance to dwell on the show’s long history.
Despite its musical and nostalgic excellence, the show jumps from one conclusion to another far too quickly. For example, the interns nearly solve the season’s biggest mystery within the span of a minute. Though this was supposed to be a heartfelt display of how much the interns had learned from Bones, the whole moment instead came off as incredibly unnatural and rehearsed. The fast-paced quality and quick succession of scenes watered down the quality of its content. Perhaps if the finale had a longer run time, it could have fleshed out each issue fully, making the events feel more natural.
The “Bones” finale gives each character a happy ending while staying true to its vision. Its music’s emotional relevance creates both nostalgic and intense atmospheres as Bones’s head injury provides the perfect platform for reminiscing. However, because the show weaves through its conflicts too abruptly, it takes away from the riveting suspense that has been the selling point of “Bones” in the past 12 seasons.

On March 2, a week after releasing his fourth album, “Drunk,” Thundercat posted to Facebook a review from music mag The Fader, titled “Thundercat’s Drunk Is A Revealing Look At The Ways We Cope.” He added the terse caption, “It is what it is.” This quiet unease about categorization appears forcefully in his interviews: When Fact Magazine asked if he would describe the music of Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald as “yacht rock,” Thundercat replied, “No. I would describe their music as ‘awesome.’… Just like [with] anything else, people have to compartmentalize things.” This resistance to pigeonholing manifests itself most thrillingly in his music itself, which is endlessly diverse in style, tone, and subject matter. It seems a singular injustice to confine such a capacious record to one interpretation, because “Drunk” encompasses everything. As Thundercat sings on “Where I’m Going,” “Everything and nothing / Twirling around in my head.”
Such a line urges any attentive listener to reflect on the incredible crucible that is Thundercat’s head—taking care, of course, not to partake in the same sort of pigeonholing. A direct descendant of such pioneering jazz bassists as Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke, Thundercat has contributed his talents to albums by Erykah Badu, Flying Lotus, Kamasi Washington, and Kendrick Lamar; in fact, he was one of the primary architects behind Lamar’s 2015 magnum opus “To Pimp a Butterfly.” Yet Thundercat is also a dedicated weirdo: He took his stage name from the ‘80s animated series “ThunderCats,” after all. Off record, Thundercat regularly exercises his off-kilter sense of humor, engaging in bass battles with a robot Hannibal Buress on “The Eric Andre Show” and trading non sequiturs over Twitter with Zack Fox, the artist and Internet jester who allegedly inspired the album. He watches “Scooby-Doo” and “Dragon Ball Z,” plays “Diablo” and “Mortal Kombat,” and hangs out with his cat, Turbo Tron Over 9000 Baby Jesus Sally, to whom he has penned many a paean.
On “Drunk,” Thundercat seamlessly synthesizes the two parts of his personality, as though the virtuoso and the stoned nerd had performed the Fusion Dance from “Dragon Ball Z” before stepping into the recording studio. Shortly after the intro “Rabbot Ho” invites listeners to “go hard, get drunk, and travel down a rabbit hole,” the following track “Captain Stupido” offers lines like “I feel weird / Comb your beard, brush your teeth / Still feel weird / Beat your meat, go to sleep” over frenetic basslines that squiggle at breakneck tempos. Tossing in a couple time signature switch-ups and an expertly placed fart noise for good measure, Thundercat offers the best of both his native worlds while yanking the listener on what viscerally feels like a journey. 
This interplay between musicianship and comedy yields songs both stunning and surprising. On “A Fan’s Mail (Tron Song Suite II),” Thundercat establishes a melancholy mood well-suited for meditations on mortality, yet the song turns out to be another ode to his cat: The chorus literally goes, “Cool to be a cat (meow, meow, meow, meow).” The cheery, chiming “Bus In These Streets” tackles technology dependence “Black Mirror”-style, if “Black Mirror” eased off the fearmongering and developed a good-natured sense of humor. It also showcases Thundercat’s divine falsetto: Arguably the most gorgeous moment of the album comes when he disputes the necessity of Tweeting one’s every thought, crooning, “Won’t you leave some things to mystery? / Opening your mouth removes all doubt / So be quiet.” The peak of Thundercat’s hilarity arrives on the chugging, chiptune “Tokyo,” which tracks his fish-fueled spree through Tokyo’s Gundam Cafes and suicide forests (cue second terrified fart noise). It also includes this anecdote about the origin of his nerdy obsession with Japan: “This all started when I was a boy / I went to the dentist and he gave me a toy / It was Dragon Ball Z, a wrist-slap bracelet / Goku fucking ruined me.”
Yet Thundercat balances these bits of farce with moments of genuine pathos. These dominate the second half of the album, with Thundercat touching on madness, insomnia, heartbreak, and death. No song proves as moving as “Them Changes,” which opens with Thundercat anxiously singing this arresting first line: “Nobody move, there’s blood on the floor.” He mourns the violent loss of his heart over a hypnotic bass melody and an Isley Brothers drum loop, concluding with the brutal lines, “Now I’m sitting here with a black hole in my chest / A heartless, broken mess.” Thundercat also broaches social issues on “Jameel’s Space Ride,” in which a fantasy of riding a bike into space gets disrupted by the threat of police brutality: “I want to go right / I’m safe on my block / Except for the cops / Will they attack? / Would it be ’cause I’m black?” Throughout the album, Thundercat proves that he can handle the serious as well as the lighthearted.
Thundercat’s versatility extends to his musical arrangements as well. Name any genre, and he mostly likely draws from it: ‘70s funk, ‘80s pop, jazz, soul, RnB, hip hop, electronic music, etc. He traffics unironically and fruitfully in camp: not only does he get Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald to hop on first single “Show You The Way,” he also makes them sound fresh. The bossa nova groove of “Walk On By” sounds like Thundercat’s attempt to reclaim elevator music; that this effort succeeds, and that he also commissioned Kendrick Lamar to deliver a typically brilliant verse on it, attest to his genius. Thundercat effortlessly achieves a fusion of myriad disparate elements, one that anyone could find appealing. You could play this album in the car with your parents, and they would probably bob their heads and smile.

Though Harvard’s collections of art, artifacts, scientific specimens, and more have historically been divided according to discipline, today many at the university’s museums, including the Harvard Art Museums and the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, are seeking greater integration and collaboration. Museums are experimenting with exhibitions that cross the divides of academic disciplines and asking new questions. What counts as art? What is worthy of display in museums? What obligations do museums have to their histories?

It is a little known fact that Harvard’s numerous museums originally began as a collection housed under one roof: the Philosophy Chamber. In 1820, a team of Harvard faculty and officials dismantled the Chamber and divided it into collections categorized by discipline and topic. Those collections evolved into today’s Harvard museums. Now, almost 200 years later, curators at the Harvard Art Museums are working to undo that separation. In an effort led by Ethan Lasser, Head of the Division of European and American Art and curator of American Art, Harvard Art Museums staff are working to piece the room back together for a temporary exhibition.They seek to revisit the rationale for the original division and unlock the untold stories of the museums and university collections. 
“At one time, the sciences and the arts were under one roof—literally, within four walls,” Lasser said. “In a way, the map of the university … today has its origins in decisions by faculty and officials in 1820 who were dividing this collection, parsing it through the different subfields.” In many ways, the fate of the Philosophy Chamber symbolizes the evolution of teaching philosophy. The 19th century saw a shift toward academic specialization and the categorization of the Harvard collections by their disciplines. Though each Harvard museum opened its doors at a different time in the university’s history—the Fogg in 1895, the Germanic Museum in 1903, the Sackler in 1985, the Peabody in 1866—the governing philosophy of past decades suggested that academic material was to remain separated by discipline, with little or no overlap. “The divisions that exist now are historical ones,” Martha Tedeschi, director of the Harvard Art Museums, said. “If all the objects were delivered to Harvard now, I’m sure the divisions would be very different. But they grew out of the historical context, and I think they very much reflect the way disciplines were being taught at Harvard, and who the luminaries and professors of that moment were.” The conversations that took place in the Philosophy Chamber in 1820 represented a landmark transition in the history of the museums at Harvard, as well as in the history of academic thought. “There were debates in there about scholarly, academic matters, about scholarship’s complicity ... in realizing broader political agendas in good and bad ways, and questions about who should have access to knowledge,” Lasser said. “It’s important that the past allows us to reflect on those things. It’s a moment … in some ways to celebrate, but also a story that takes us into the best and worst of the university’s past. I think it seems like a good moment to have that balance in mind.” Though the historical Philosophy Chamber exhibition draws on a moment in the university’s history, its significance is relevant to ongoing debates in museums today about the categorization of their objects. “The exhibition will obviously be about the past,” Lasser said, “but not only about the past. The objects that were brought in are highly, highly contemporary in their own way.”

In many cases, the wishes of donors determine an object’s eventual place of display. Objects come to the Harvard museums as gifts from donors or purchases by the museum, Tedeschi explained. “We’re involved in a collection assessment project right now where each curator is looking at the collection in their field, and looking at what the strengths and the weaknesses are, and where we might want to build or expand our holdings,” she said. “So we’re actively looking to see what areas have been neglected in the past, where might we want to take the collection next.”
Like other museums, Harvard’s collections adhere to specific historical norms of cataloguing and categorization. These norms erect disciplinary divisions between museums, establishing distinct identities for each museum, according to Yukio Lippit, Chair of the Department of History of Art and Architecture. “These conditions and the way we categorize the world and its cultural production are constantly evolving,” he wrote in an email. “Just look at the way in which academic departments at universities, as well as the courses they offer over the decades, are constantly changing. So current academic and museum practice, to a certain extent, is forced to overcome the historical conditions under which collections and institutions were formed.”
In other cases, though, collections are in certain museums because of their original intended purpose. For example, in the 1870s and 1880s, German father and son glassmaking duo Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka produced a series of glass models of invertebrate sea animals for private aquariums. Though it was possible to keep sea animals, it was difficult to display them aesthetically. With glass versions of jellyfish and anemone, aquarium-keepers could more easily showcase beautiful aquatic displays. Louis Agassiz, founder of Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, purchased some of the Blaschka’s invertebrate models to display and use as a teaching tool for zoology students.
Inspired by Agassiz, Harvard botany professors of the time decided to commission a collection of glass flowers in 1886. Cold Cambridge winters prevented them from teaching students with real flora and forced them to turn instead to inaccurate models made out of papier-mâché and wax. The Blaschkas were commissioned to produce a series of floral glass models for the purposes of botanical instruction.
“Almost immediately, as soon as they started putting them out in the exhibit gallery, they became a tourist attraction,” Jane Pickering, Executive Director at the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. “They were done for scientific purposes at the behest of the faculty, but then, in and of themselves, became these amazing works of art.”
Though the two collections of glass objects, both with artistic merit, were produced by the same makers, they found homes in science museums rather than art museums. Even though both collections might be considered artistically meritorious, their origins as scientific instruments of instruction for botanical and zoological purposes place them in the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Comparative Zoology, respectively, rather than in the Harvard Art Museums.
In other contexts, however, the models are understood differently. Some of the Blaschkas’ remaining invertebrate models were acquired by Cornell. Those models are today on display at the Corning Museum of Glass, a center specifically dedicated to glassmaking as an artistic medium. “They’ve totally made the transfer over since they’re now displayed in the Corning Museum rather than the biology museum of Cornell,” Pickering said. “That, to me, is interesting because it shows this historical development. Especially in a place like Harvard, we are very much a product of our history.”

The history of Harvard’s museums can also have effects that some staff and students say are problematic. For some, the divisions between exhibits of certain objects reflects a certain reliance on outdated notions of what is worthy of display or public attention.
Anthropology has historically engaged primarily with non-Western cultures, whereas the art showcased in art museums often tends toward Western art—a difference that became concrete in the distinct identities of each type of museum, according to Irene C. McLaughlin, Curator of North American Ethnography at the Peabody Museum. “In the 19th century, people often didn’t accord much respect to anthropology because they didn’t think at that time that the study of non-Western people was as worthy as the study of Western civilization,” she said. “Art museums and art historians, of course, felt … that Western art was more highly valued than art from the rest of the world. In fact, they often did not even apply that term ‘art’ to the products of other cultures.”
Some now see these historical divisions as outdated. “The Peabody's collections are overwhelmingly non-European in origin,” Julian Rauter ’19, a social anthropology concentrator and member of the HMSC student board, wrote in an email. “The problem with anthropology (as opposed to art or history) is less what is being represented and more how it is being represented; rather than excluding the work of non-Europeans, our discipline has been guilty of viewing them like you would view a biological specimen.”
Another reason for the divisions is the inherent tendency of anthropology to view objects as objects in their own right, rather than for their aesthetic value, according to McLaughlin. “Anthropology museums have been criticized for not recognizing the artistic dimensions of the objects they have,” she said. “Anthropology in the early days was most concerned with not going for the exotic and most beautiful object … The whole worldview of anthropology is how people behave on a daily basis, not the masterpieces that they occasionally collect. That doesn’t mean anthropologists were never aware of native individuals that were especially skilled, what we might call artists today.”
The Harvard Museums of Science and Culture have made several attempts to correct the problem of Western dominance, including their year-long “Race, Representation, and Museums” lecture series. “Right now, for the past year through the end of this semester, the HMSC’s been running a series of lectures, seminars, and dialogues about race and how that plays into the museum curation practice,” Celnik said. “They’ve been making a very conscious effort to publicly talk about this.”
At the Peabody, several exhibits address the issue head-on. “The Peabody's new exhibit on the history of anthropology has tackled problematic representations of indigenous cultures head-on, and I think that's a sign of self-awareness about this key issue,” Rauter wrote. The exhibition, "All the World Is Here: Harvard’s Peabody Museum and the Invention of American Anthropology," will open on April 22.
Meanwhile, at the Harvard Art Museums, the Sackler Museum has always displayed Mediterranean and Asian art. Curators are making efforts to mitigate the legacy of outdated museum divisions. One such effort is a gallery of African art, currently on loan from the Peabody. “These are true masterpieces of African art and we have them here, and we get to see them next to a gallery of art from the Islamic lands, just around the corner from European painting, and close to Chinese and Korean works of art,” said Jessica L. Martinez, Research Curator of African Art Initiatives at the Harvard Art Museums. “So then you get to see how Africa is part of a dynamic and global story. Africa is the nexus of the story that we’re telling.”
To some, however, even the notion that non-Western culture needs to be classified as “art” in order to be considered significant or important is problematic. “It reduces all culture to this common denominator of formal properties of material things that basically strips out the cultural context,” McLaughlin said. “Many people have argued that it’s an elevation of other cultures to call it art, but I think that’s a little patronizing. I know that people mean well that are trying to promote the recognition of non-Western arts…. It’s a complicated question.”
On the other hand, Martinez suggested that the installation of African art at the Harvard Art Museums is a way of examining the objects from an artistic standpoint. “We believe deeply that African art is central to a larger art history story that we tell here at the museum,” said Martinez. “We want to see the works from the Peabody Museum in an art museum context and ask, how do we look at these works as new? What fresh perspectives can we take when we see the Peabody collections in an art museum context?”

“Here, history is treated with innovation—old becomes new, art and science are partners,” reads the introduction of “Open,” a commemorative guide published at the reopening of the renovated Harvard Art Museums in 2014. But the idea that “art and science are partners” is a relatively new one. Around the time of the Philosophy Chamber’s dismantling in 1820, the prevalent teaching philosophy indicated a trend toward the categorization of material by disciplines.
Exhibitions of university collections today reflect these shifting pedagogical priorities. “We’re thinking about how an exhibition is an argument,” Pickering said. “For example, you’re telling a story or making an argument in an exhibition … Often those things don’t just come from one place. You wouldn’t just use an object or set of objects from one museum if you were looking at a complicated topic, or something that was very multidisciplinary. You’re going to want to bring objects from lots of museums.” At the Harvard Art Museums, the ability to draw on collections from the Peabody or Houghton Library allows for a more global view. “There’s a great interest among museums in general now at offering a more global exhibition calendar, that isn’t so focused on one part of the world, or one medium,” Tedeschi said. “There are many different possibilities for borrowing here, which means that we can think outside of the boxes we inherited.” Cross-disciplinary exhibits have been a practice of Harvard museums for several decades. A 1927 photograph depicts a Mayan art exhibition in the Fogg Museum featuring objects on loan from the Peabody. That interdisciplinary trend continues in a contemporary context, as museum curators work to strengthen their exhibits by drawing on the collections of other museums. An upcoming exhibition at the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments entitled “Scale: A Matter of Perspective” examines the notion of scale from different perspectives and features objects on loan from multiple museums and university collections. The exhibition will cover subjects ranging from astronomical instruments to biological models and ethnological concepts to literary devices. “[The exhibition] includes how we look at scale, how we measure and observe it in terms of microscopes and telescopes,” Pickering said. “We have objects that come from every museum, as well as some of the library collections as well, because we’re looking at a broad-based topic. You wouldn’t be able to do that with just collections from the Peabody.” “[‘Scale’] really made me think about the way that we often arbitrarily deem certain objects as ‘belonging’ to one discipline or another,” Rauter wrote. “When you get down to it, all museums are trying to show the world through a different lens, just like all academic disciplines. I think there could be a lot more crossover in curation.” The effort to bridge disciplinary gaps requires a certain level of communication between museums. “The staffs of all the museums are talking to each other constantly,” Pickering said. “We’re making an effort to borrow from each other. There are some very practical reasons why that’s a great idea, because Harvard has astounding collections and it’s relatively inexpensive to borrow something from across campus.” The impetus to design unconventional exhibits can also come from faculty, some of whom see the need to integrate university collections into the curricula of their courses. For some courses, museum collections serve as an integral component of curriculum. “It is safe to say that the museum collections have been incorporated into almost every class I have taught over the years,” Lippit said. “Whether a seminar or lecture course, this has involved bringing students into the gallery, storage rooms, or now the art study centers, doing visual analyses or writing research papers on museum objects.”

As academic philosophies evolve, the Harvard museums are working to adapt their exhibitions to fit the expanding definitional limits of their divisions and separate focuses. “I think it’s definitely true, and certainly coming at it as a scientist, that if you see the importance of research as being to help humanity deal with its huge challenges, and the only way we’re going to sort of address those challenges is by thinking across disciplines, that we just can’t answer these questions,” Pickering said. “We cannot begin to understand and answer questions associated with these topics without bringing in people from many different disciplines.” Many museum staff recognize that cross-disciplinary work is impossible without a solid base of collaboration between departments. “Collaboration is alive and well on college campuses and university campuses,” Tedeschi said. “The interdisciplinary [focus] and collaboration go hand in hand: the recognition that different disciplines can actually feed each other and enhance each other. The museum is a fantastic place for that to happen. For any object that you can look at in history, there are so many different lenses through which you can examine it.” Interdisciplinary exhibits benefit academic thought, according to Pickering. “Since I firmly believe that museum collections have a huge role in this sort of research … I therefore think it’s very important to do this interdisciplinary work, because if you don’t, then you’re not using the collections to their fullest extent, but then you’re also not doing useful things,” she said. If the ideology surrounding disciplines changed once, though, there is certainly the chance that it will shift again, necessitating further shifts in museum practices. “I’m sure philosophies will change,” Tedeschi said. “They have ever since we’ve been paying attention, so there’s no reason to think they won’t change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sandra Lerner is a painter based in New York whose work explores the intersections between Eastern philosophy and theories in physics and cosmology. Her work is featured in collections around the world, including the Kampo Museum in Kyoto and the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Connecticut. Currently, ten of her paintings are on display in the Gutman Gallery, at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education. This exhibit, “Creative Flux,” takes as its theme visual representations of Taoism and modern physics.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you discover Taoism?
Sandra Lerner: In the sixties, I went to a gallery opening that was selling these books on Taoism, and I read a passage by Lao Tsu from the “Tao Te Ching”.
“Look, it cannot be seen-it is beyond form—
Listen, it cannot be heard-it is beyond sound.—
Grasp, it cannot be held- it is intangible.—
These three are indefinable,
Therefore they are joined in one.”
“Stand before it and there is no beginning.
Follow it and there is no end.
Stay with the ancient Tao,
Move with the present.”
I discovered this in the midst of the human potential movement, and I became very interested in Taoism, Buddhism, and eastern philosophy. Then in the mid-sixties, I read Lawrence LeShan’s book, ‘The Medium, the Mystic, and the Physicist.’ I was thunderstruck by the similarities with physics and what they were proving and theorizing, which was so similar to what the Eastern mystics have been experiencing for thousands of years—that in the universe everything is interconnected, interdependent, and molecules on the smallest level [are] creating, annihilating, co-creating again.
THC: How have your trips to Japan and elsewhere in Asia influenced your art?
SL: I’ve travelled through Asia and been to Japan many times. I studied calligraphy with a master calligrapher there. This calligrapher in Japan sort of adopted me as a daughter, and I spent a total of eight months there studying with him, and I was an honored guest.
THC: How would you describe the paintings in this show?
SL: So what I do in my paintings is I use the dichotomies, which would be hard edges and the morphosis shape. For example, the line from the mountains where the softness of the background … seeps into this, and I have a framework for this, and it loops forward in the same way that Randall suggests that gravity is seeping in from a different universe. And also it could be that when we look at the sky, our eye is a frame, since we can’t see the whole universe in the same way astronomers look at the universe through a telescope. For me the lines thrusting outwards, using the hard edge with the texture and juxtaposing all the polarities in the paintings, is something that has really informed my work.
THC: Are the pictures meant to evoke landscape scenes?
SL: I try to suggest shapes. And many times these shapes to me look like mountains. It could be rivers, it could be lakes. And I just suggest, because I want the viewer to finish the rest of the story. And in this, I did feel the wave, because particles change into waves and waves change back into particles. Everywhere I am thinking about particles in flux and nature in flux as we are constantly evolving.
THC: What do you hope that the Harvard community takes away from your show?
SL: I really just want them to feel the work, and I think that with my work it’s not just a matter of thinking, it’s a matter of pondering. I just suggest things, but I also want someone to look and see what the calligraphy means and draw their own conclusions. So it’s something that the viewer participates in. I have had collectors say to me years after they bought paintings, every time we look at it, at different stages in our lives, it means different things, and it seems to evolve as they evolve.

To the Editor:
We write concerning The Crimson Editorial Board’s piece on Harvard’s chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi’s recent decision to go gender neutral.
Aside from the merits of the text itself, we were surprised to see the cartoon that accompanied the piece. This cartoon depicts a Jewish kid sitting in a chair smiling, with President Faust and Dean Khurana hovering over him. We find the cartoon creepy and offensive. We think that it may suggest more about the thinking prevalent on The Crimson Editorial Board than the article itself.
The hand-drawn image of a young student in bliss, benevolently watched over by a towering Faust and Khurana, contains eerie echoes of authoritarian paternalism.  Somebody on The Crimson’s editorial staff should have recognized the damaging associations raised by including this cartoon. There is a long history of Jews being represented in caricature in newspaper illustrations, as well as the old stereotype of a “court Jew” cravenly seeking protection by shamefully cozying up to those in power. We do not suggest that The Crimson Editorial Board should not comment on events on campus or ever draw a Jewish figure, but this particular image calls for particular sensitivity.
We see the opposite of sensitivity. The cartoon includes an image of a kippah, a traditional Jewish prayer garment, which apparently represents AEPi. Many AEPi brothers do not actually wear kippot. Yet The Crimson Editorial Board has no problem using the stereotypical image to represent all Jews. Moreover, it places the kippah next to a Harvard baseball cap, conjuring up images of athletes choosing schools on signing day. This appears to suggest that members need to choose between their Jewish identity and a spot at the school. To be clear, we did not wake up in the morning quivering because of this tasteless cartoon. But imagine if an editorial in The Crimson had included a cartoon that uses a sombrero to represent Latino students, a keffiyeh to represent Muslim students, a conical hat to represent Asian students, or a rastacap to represent Caribbean students. There would surely be a massive uproar across campus. Dean Khurana, depicted smiling benevolently in this cartoon, would likely host an emergency town hall complete with baked goods and Play-Doh.
We have little tolerance for double standards in our community. Jewish community centers across the country are currently receiving bomb threats while we are seeing anti-Semitism surge on college campuses nationwide. This editorial was meant to celebrate a step forward in building a more inclusive campus. The cartoon that runs alongside it sends another message. Perhaps Harvard has moved backwards in the past few years. Perhaps our innumerable committees on inclusion and belonging should stop rewording lyrics and replacing parking signs long enough to ask this question— does Harvard continue to hold double standards for Jews? For now, this much remains in doubt: on a campus with a long history of anti-Semitism, it is unclear whether either Massachusetts Hall or the Editorial Board of The Crimson cares that Jews feel we have a place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The moment I entered Starbucks’ restroom, I bumped into a lady in her mid-60s, characterized by a shriveled face and visibly decaying teeth. She was carrying a bag overfilled with medicine and her threadbare clothing brought out the scars on her hands and legs.
As she began groaning in pain, I sprinted to get her crutch. We began talking, and I discovered that she was living with a few others near the Garage.
Eight years ago, she had been deserted by her family and had boarded a bus from Houston to a homeless veteran facility in Connecticut where she received medical treatment for a second-stage renal disease. But three years later she found herself abandoned by the facility for failing to pay rent. The facility also chose to retain her Social Security and other identity documents. From the facility, she had a found a way to Boston and now lived on the streets. Due to her continued health condition, she had to pass bowels several times during the day and night, when it was freezing cold and most painful.
Moved by her condition, I looked up the nearest veteran facilities for homeless elderly people and came across an entire database of specialized veteran-centric services for those who qualified as mentally or physically handicapped. But all of them required enrollees to pay an annual rent of 30 percent of their annual income. Even the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter requires that short term and extended stay beds be for sober men and women. Extended stay beds are assigned by lottery and are typically reserved for people who are working.
Being an international student in Massachusetts had little helped me to understand the maladies of the homeless American. But in the case of veterans such as the old lady, it wasn’t hard to tell that unemployment as a result of old age was not the only factor contributing to her homelessness. Lack of family and social support accompanied by various health complications including hearing and speech impairment, dental problems, loss of vision, chronic illnesses, and an end-stage disease had landed her in a cycle of debt.
Despite being largely informed about programs available to her, the lady had fallen victim to an enrollment policy leading to detention of her Social Security and identity documents. This is problematic because, in many cases, homeless individuals need documents to prove their disability and receive benefits or assistance.
Documentation is not the only obstacle, however. For this woman, health care was highly needed and highly inaccessible. A report by the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, documents the incredible challenges of the Medicaid enrollment process, including language barriers, low literacy levels, absence of stable contact information, and documentation. Poor health conditions further hinder understanding and completion of the application. And a lack of reliable transportation contributes to delays or denials of applications. Therefore, despite the presence of widespread private and public insurance schemes, a large number of Americans remained uninsured.
Federal government-administered national social insurance programs pose a similar problem for healthcare. Programs like Medicare and Medicaid, for example, require the citizen to have paid into the system through payroll taxes or shared costs. These programs are also part of the health insurance problem as they generally cover only about half of health care charges, leaving the rest to be covered through supplemental insurance or out-of-pocket.
In order to solve the problems of our healthcare system and begin to tackle the plight of homelessness, we must push for more comprehensive solutions. Investing in organizations, institutions, and funds with the intention of generating social and environmental impact alongside a financial return (termed as impact investing) should be looked to as a sustainable and far-reaching solution.
Homelessness does not directly affect us all, but it is necessary to understand that homelessness is not a choice but a social problem. Currently, 564,708 Americans are homeless and 1.4 million are on the verge of homelessness. These people are members of our own community, living off the streets in extreme weather conditions―individuals who are or once were someone’s father, mother, wife, or child. We may be blessed with a strong support system in times of need, but not everyone is so fortunate. It is therefore vital that we extend such support and services to those lacking them.
It is our responsibility to provide more funds and create an ecosystem of services that continuously seeks to contributes to the stability of the homeless and almost homeless. Because everyone―rich or poor, old or young, differently abled or unemployed―has the right to have a safe, dignified, and secure life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Apr. 13, 2011, at 3:40 p.m.
Despite the unique difficulties that low-income and first-generation students face in their transition to college, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a proposal to create a summer bridge program. In response, the Undergraduate Council announced plans to fund additional programming for freshmen during Opening Days. This funding would be available to 89 affinity groups associated with the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations in order to help these groups increase their programming and help students transition to life at Harvard.
While we commend UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 for developing these plans, this solution is ultimately unsustainable and can only, as the two acknowledged in their email last Wednesday, be a starting point for a comprehensive first-year bridge program.
As proponents of the UC initiative themselves realize, the task of distributing funds to 89 different organizations is difficult. The budget will attempt to incentivize student groups to work together in order to prevent the dilution of funding grants. While this is logistically necessary, it will most likely have a negative effect on the quality of programming as no two groups' needs are the same. Forcing collaboration could lead to the conflation of unique experiences and needs.
Obtaining sufficient funds also appears difficult under this plan. A group’s funding needs can be difficult to determine by arbitrary metrics, and the UC may not even have the financial strength to provide sufficient resources. This would be especially challenging given that many of the SAC groups serve low-income students.
In the first few weeks of school, freshmen should be exploring the variety of extracurricular and social opportunities available to them, not seeking out help for their struggles. Though the UC has encouraged groups to spread out programming across two weekends, disadvantaged students may still be set back by the additional time demanded. Because of this, a transition program before the year starts is the best solution.
Perhaps most importantly, the administration should realize that it is unfair to place the burden of creating and funding this programming on current undergraduates, often from marginalized backgrounds and who are themselves struggling to navigate Harvard. Incoming students should not have to solely rely on other students to teach them how to navigate this institution and its unique academic systems.
Ultimately, no effort will be sustainable or complete without greater participation by Harvard. Measures like the UC’s will hopefully improve the ability of student groups to provide resources, but the best and most comprehensive option remains, as we have said before, a summer bridge program for low-income and first-generation students. Anything less is a disservice to the students who have yet to walk through Harvard's gates.

A previous version of editorial indicated that the UC funded programming would take place during Opening Days. The programming is expected to take place after Opening Days, during the first two weeks of September, depending on the student groups' schedules.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The signs in the yard intend to be endearing: "Whoever you are, you are Harvard." Yet, despite (and in spite) of the College’s efforts, I’m hesitant to hang my hat on this hollow truth.
-----
I remember my parents telling stories of their youth when I was younger—my father’s voice holding my hand gently as he talked of his rough beginnings. I felt my fingers fold in a bit like dog-eared pages with the lilts in his tone as he recalled fonder times and the raspier dips with the not-so fond memories.
We had different views of what the world looked like at five. Mine is scary movies on rainy days with the neighbor kids, pruned fingers and blue lips in the summer, tiptoeing to the basement early in the morning to play with my siblings. His is 77 steps and kids he shouldn’t have been around, mouth run thin from constant translation, running downstairs to the bodega beneath their apartment to pay as much of the water bill as they could before the landlord turned it off again.
At fourteen I ran away from home and didn’t tell anyone. I packed my backpack with some books and a granola bar and walked to the park around the corner, sat on the swings for an hour, then went back home.  At fourteen, my mother was working under the table at a bakery known for hiring Portuguese immigrants. She would be gone for hours at a time, and at the end of the week would hand her paycheck to her mother like clockwork.
Eighteen was a turning point for all of us for very different reasons. My father left for the Coast Guard to give himself a chance. My mother chose to turn her life around. I was the first in my family to leave my state, my family, and my home for college.
-----
The first time I walked into Harvard Yard I didn't even realize it. It was early June—everything was green, save for the golden foot of the John Harvard statue. I was on a school field trip through the Gifted & Talented program in my middle school, which attempted to incentivize us to pursue a path of higher education by organizing this trip, using Harvard as the castle on the hill exemplar. I followed the pack of students into the Yard, standing towards the back of the group while everyone vied for a spot near the statue, trying to rub the foot for good luck. We moved on with the tour quickly, and I never got the chance to touch it. I thought my hopes to attend this school—and any other school for that matter—had withered away as quickly as they had blossomed.
On the bus ride home I stuffed my thoughts and dreams and hopes and wonders of this college and this world into my backpack, tucking it away—out of sight and out of mind. I knew deep down places like this weren’t meant for me to call mine. This place was alive with intelligence and money and power, promising a greatness I couldn’t conceive as tangible with hands like mine. What was mine was dirty Jerz, a long line of farmers and laborers, people whose lives revolved around the next paycheck to sustain their families, not textbooks or pursuing higher education.
The next time I walked into Harvard Yard, I was an admitted student of the Class of 2020. This place was going to be home, was offering itself palms upturned to be mine—and I didn’t know how to reconcile that with what seventh grade me knew was true.
-----
I didn’t truly know what being a first-generation student meant until I came to college. Sure, it was simple to look at the parts of me that fell into the stereotypical description and understand them on paper; it was another thing, however, to feel the vertigo between Harvard and home.
Opening Days taught me this quickly. Conversations with other freshman showed that there was a melody here, an almost silent refrain that only those with trained ears can pick up on. It was implicit knowledge on how to traverse the system that was distinct between groups of peoples that began to take shape in the nascency of freshman year. For the most part, those of privileged backgrounds clung to one another. They knew the classes to take, how to ask for help, had the “ins” to all the complex extracurricular and social scenes, utilized their parents as resources on what to do in college so as to not make as many mistakes.
From inside that circle, I’m assuming that their privilege isn’t as flagrant—yet outside of that conversation, the gift of this prior knowledge is highly recognizable, and highly sought after. In lacking these tools at our disposal, other first-gens and I meander through the college experience relying on little but ourselves, making mistakes that could have easily have been avoided through programs that taught us how to ask for help, through programs that taught us the academic and social nuances of Harvard, through programs that assured us that despite wherever we’re from, we are Harvard too.
-----
What was mine was still dirty Jerz, Brick City and my hometown and all the tales between these two cities. What was mine is still mine, will forever be a part of me; yet, as I continue to grow in my intellectual and educational pursuits here, I realize that where I come from puts me at a systematic disadvantage from my peers. I still don’t know if I’m doing this right, if I am utilizing the breadth and depth of opportunities here to the best of my ability—but I do know that this is my home now, and I will do my best to make sure that in some way, shape, or form, I am Harvard too.

UPDATED: April 11, 2017 at 1:44 p.m.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 will lead this year’s Commencement exercises as chief marshal.
The position is awarded to class members from the 25th reunion class who has achieved success in their careers, contributed to their communities, and served the College, according to the Harvard Alumni Association. In a statement, HAA’s president Martin J. Grasso Jr. ’78 praised Healey’s selection as chief marshal.
“Harvard Commencement is a celebration of the achievements of all the degree recipients during their time at Harvard and also an opportunity to welcome them as Harvard alumni,” Grasso said. “It will be a high honor to have Attorney General Healey serve as our chief marshal, and will greatly contribute to the special and memorable nature of the day for the many graduates, families, and alumni joining us in May.”
Healey—the state’s premier prosecutor—has made headlines in recent months due to a legal dispute with the natural resources behemoth ExxonMobil, which her office argued was obscuring information as to whether the company was hiding the harmful effects of climate change from the public.
She has also frequently pilloried President Donald Trump, calling him a “chaos candidate” who has evolved into a “chaos president." Healey has also filed a lawsuit against Trump’s administration for his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven predominantly-Muslim countries.
In May, Healey will be responsible for leading the alumni procession to Tercentenary Theatre, where the bulk of the campus’s main Commencement activities—including Class Day and the Commencement speeches—take place. She will also host a lunch for alumni and other special guests to the University.
While at the College, Healey concentrated in government and captained the women’s basketball team, eventually taking two years to play at the professional level in Austria before returning to the United States to pursue law. She hasn’t dropped the sport completely, though—she’s earned a reputation in Boston for her skills on the court, trouncing Governor Charlie Baker in a basketball game in 2014.
Healey was elected attorney general in 2014.
Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 led the Commencement exercises for the 25th reunion class last year.

Peer education group Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College hosted Sex Weekend, a three-day event aimed at issues of sex, sexual health, relationships, and other sex-related topics, from Friday to Sunday.
The weekend's events were dubbed an abbreviated version of Sex Week, which happens in the fall, according to SHEATH co-president Lita D. Pena ’19.
“Our goal is to connect diverse individuals and communities both within and beyond Harvard through common human experiences, and to open up campus dialogue about these important issues,” she said.
The first event of the weekend was a film screening of “Sticky: A (Self) Love Story,” with a follow-up conversation about masturbation after the documentary. The film discussed the history and misconceptions surrounding masturbation.
Roberto Ruiz-Melendez ’20 said the film showed “how important it is to be sex positive.”
“I actually learned a lot,” he said. “I went just because my friends told me to and I was like, ‘Yeah sure, why not?’ But it was interesting to see the incredible amount of smear campaigns and negative ads against masturbation.”
Ruiz-Melendez said one of the most intriguing facts he learned was that the man who invented the Graham cracker wanted to stop people from having sex, “so they made really bland food that would kill people's sexual desire.”
The next event was a workshop called “Vocalizing Desire,” hosted by a representative from Good Vibrations, a Harvard Square sex toy vendor that "promotes sexual health, pleasure and empowerment,” according to its website.
“This workshop focused on increasing sexual communication between partners regarding safer sex practices, consent and boundaries, and wants and desires,” Pena said.
The final event of the weekend focused on how race and sexuality intersect.
“We hope that people can find a space that’s open and welcoming to discuss some of their anxieties or interests about sex and sexuality,” SHEATH co-president Amelia Lamp ’19 said.
In addition to the three events, SHEATH members distributed several different brands of free condoms and lubricants, candles that melt into a massaging oil, and vibrators and other toys donated by various companies including Good Vibrations, Pena said.
Claira Janover ’20, a member of SHEATH, said that the weekend was a fun way to discuss sex.
“I think it’s a really great way to make learning about sex fun,” Janover said. “A lot of people want to have a vibrator or have masturbation toys, but don’t want to express that desire.”

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he does not believe the College’s new social group policy requires an oath pledging a student is not a member of a final club or Greek organization, despite a Faculty motion alleging the opposite.
At the April 4 Faculty meeting, biology professor David A. Haig—a vocal opponent of the College’s policy on single-gender social organizations—presented a motion which stated, “This faculty does not approve of Harvard College requiring a student to make an oath, pledge or affirmation about whether the student belongs to a particular organization or category of organizations.”
In an interview last Friday, though, Smith said he disagreed with the premise of Haig’s motion—for the policy, as he read it, does not require such an affirmation.
“I don’t think the College at this point is asking for any oaths, and therefore, debating whether or not we think we should have one is not high on my agenda here,” Smith said.
Haig’s motion was directed at proposed requirement that students applying to leadership positions, athletic captaincies, or postgraduate fellowships sign a document asserting they have not belonged to a single-gender social group in the past year—and will not for “at least one year after their tenure as holder of the fellowship or award.”
“This document should be regarded as an agreement between the individual student and the College,” the implementation report reads.
At the April meeting, the Faculty voted to refer Haig’s motion to a committee tasked with revising or replacing the policy. Haig is a member of that committee.
Smith likened the document signing requirement to other pieces of “paperwork” where students must affirm their understanding of the College’s policies.
“I don’t think that’s unreasonable to remind students as they’re moving into something that ‘here’s our policies and rules about something,’” Smith said.
In addition to Haig’s motion, Smith also commented on other Faculty concerns from last week’s meeting.
Smith reiterated his alarm that there were no women elected to the six open seats on the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest governing body. He said that he believes the election procedure of the Council—candidates for Council seats are nominated and voted on by the entire Faculty—is not the place to make changes to encourage a more diverse outcome.
“I’m sure there’s a whole set of other challenges in this that are making the outcome not what we would ideally like to see in this whole thing, and that’s why I’m asking for thoughts outside what I and the Council know,” he said.
At the meetings Smith told Faculty that he will ask the Standing Committee on Women to investigate the disparity.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, Faculty voted to approve a schedule change that, starting in the fall of 2018, will extend the length of most courses to 75 minutes with 15 minutes of passing time—eliminating the informal seven minutes of passing time known as “Harvard Time.” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris first presented the proposed change at March’s Faculty meeting.
Smith said he has no qualms with a last-minute amendment to the schedule legislation by English professor James Engell that allows two hour seminars to begin at 9:45 a.m., the only exception to an otherwise rigid structure.
“I’m mostly concerned with the principles behind it that Dean Harris talked about, and making it much clearer for students when their classes are taking place, making sure the students can move between classes, making sure that we have balance between the parts of campus—the Cambridge part of campus and the Allston part of campus,” he said.
Although the schedule was almost unanimously approved by the Faculty, the meeting was not without controversy. Several math professors questioned the legitimacy of a proposed course requirement in data science.
“I certainly think from day one we’ve tried to reach out to the math department and include them in these discussions,” Smith said.

The news that Clover Food Lab will open in the Science Center in a few weeks and replace Greenhouse Cafe has started to divide the student population along culinary lines: for some, the change is a more healthful and convenient dining option, while others say they will miss the greasy grab-and go.
Quickly, the decision to swap chicken fingers for chickpea fritters in a central artery on campus has sparked a flurry of posts on social media and discussions around campus. Clover enthusiasts were thrilled to be able to grab signature pitas and popular coffee in between classes, but others expressed frustration and disappointment.
Teddy Landis ’20 said he was “very upset” when he learned that Clover—a local vegetarian chain with another location on Massachusetts Ave.— was coming into the Science Center.
“Quite honestly, I think their food does not taste good,” Landis said. “I was really excited to have a place where I can just grab a really tasty sandwich, hang out, and do a pset, and now I can hang out and do a pset, but without a really tasty sandwich.”
Alongside the recently refurbished Cabot Science Library, the new location of Clover will open in the Science Center sometime in the next few weeks, according to Lucia K. Jazayeri, director of communications for Clover. She said the new location will have a Crimson Cash reader, but was not sure if the location would be accepting BoardPlus.
“We are going to do Crimson Cash, but I’m not sure which variety,” Jazayeri said. “I know there are two different kinds. But we will have a Crimson Cash reader, we will be able to take Crimson Cash.”
The possibility of purchasing exclusively vegetarian food in between classes was enticing for some students.
“I’m excited about having Greenhouse’s space turn into Clover’s,” Gabriel H. Karger ’18 said. “I think it will be connected to more open spaces, so it’ll have some of the old feel, which is cool.”
Additionally, Jazayeri said the Science Center location will feature a coffee bar and more to-go options than the Mass Ave. location.
“This’ll be our chance to really experiment with snacks and prepackaged things that we make or things that we source from people in the Boston area that we really love,” Jazayeri said.
Clover enthusiast Angie Cui ’20 was particularly excited to be able to get Clover coffee at a more convenient location.
“I really like the coffee at Clover,” Cui said. “I’ve found that it has a lot of caffeine in it and really just wakes me up in the middle of the day.”
Still, some students remain unimpressed and disappointed. Henry G. Scott ’18 said he’ll miss Greenhouse Cafe, which served pizza, chicken fingers, and burritos to students.
“Greenhouse was a really important part of my first two years at Harvard and I was really looking forward for it to come back after construction was done in the Science Center,” Scott said. “Greenhouse I thought had amazing pizza—the best in Cambridge, for sure—and also a variety of different snack foods, whereas Clover I see as something, maybe I’d get there once a semester. They’re very strange, kind of particular types of food that appeal to less of a wide and casual audience.”
This is not the first time dining options in the Science Center have provoked strong feelings from students. In 2003, students lamented the departure from Chick-fil-A from the Science Center, and some even submitted a petition to bring the chain back to campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid silent protest, Jordan B. Peterson, a psychology professor who has drawn criticism for his stances on gender identity, spoke in the Science Center at an event hosted by the newly formed Open Campus Initiative Monday evening.
At the event, Peterson outlined his criticism of transgender people, arguing that the idea that biological sex and gender were independent quantities was “wrong.” Peterson also sharply criticized ‘safe spaces’ on college campuses, women and gender studies, and activism.
Discussing his public refusal to use pronouns other than “he” and “she,” Peterson said, “One thing I won’t do is use the made-up words of postmodern neo-Marxists, who are playing a particular game to gender identity, as an extension of their particular reprehensible philosophy.”
The event attracted quiet protest. At the start of the event, several students stood outside the Science Center with a banner sporting transgender flag colors, and flyers with information from the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. Around five students inside the event held up signs with statements of solidarity with transgender people during Peterson’s talk.
The Open Campus Initiative, a recently formed student group seeking to “test”  Harvard’s commitment to free speech, invited Peterson to Harvard. Their first two invited speakers, Peterson and political scientist Charles A. Murray ’65, are both far right academics known for their controversial views on race and gender.
Some students criticized the group for inviting these speakers, arguing that it gave a platform to hate speech.
The event was organized with assistance from the Office of Student Life.  Associate Dean of Students David R. Friedrich and Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller were present at the event, in addition to multiple Harvard University Police officers.
Protesters all remained silent throughout the event, which Open Campus Initiative president Conor Healy ’19 praised.
“I was really pleasantly surprised there were no disruptions. And I thought we did a good job challenging [Peterson],” Healy said.
Speaking to an audience overwhelmingly comprised of white men, Peterson said he thought college campuses were “overrun, in large part, with disciplines that have, in my estimation, no valid reason to exist.”
“I think disciplines like women’s studies should be defunded,” he said. “We’re causing full time, destructive employment for people who are causing nothing but trouble. What they promote has zero intellectual credibility.”
The Open Campus Initiative's next planned event will host divisive political sciencist Charles Murray in September.

As Harvard continues to renew the College’s undergraduate Houses, “several” of these decades-old buildings on campus contain asbestos, a potentially carcinogenic chemical that was once regularly used for construction.
Presence of asbestos in the Houses, though, is not a concern to administrators, who say that it is unlikely the chemical will pose any sort of health risks to students.
Last year, then-Winthrop resident Matthew W.G. Walker ’16 returned to his dorm room to find it covered in asbestos-laced dust that had fallen from the ceiling of his room. Though the discovery of asbestos kicked off a flurry of discussion about asbestos at Winthrop, many of Harvard’s older buildings contain asbestos, according to administrators.
Zachary M. Gingo, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Senior Director of Facilities Operations said asbestos can not only be found in the Houses but also in office buildings and some older libraries.  Gingo said that asbestos does not pose health risks unless it is made “friable,” or ground into a fine powder.
While Gingo did not explicitly name the Houses which have asbestos, Adams House, Eliot House, Kirkland House, Lowell House, parts of Pforzheimer House, and parts of Cabot House were all built before 1970 and have not had major renovations since.
Though the asbestos may be widespread, Gingo said Harvard ensures it does not become friable.
“Harvard takes every precaution to ensure that that does not happen on campus, employing specific maintenance protocols to avoid the damage or disturbance of potentially asbestos-containing materials," he wrote in an emailed statement.
Gingo added that House building managers are aware which parts of their house might contain asbestos, and hire “third-party experts” to remove the asbestos before any work is done on those areas.
“There's asbestos hidden away in all older buildings, but whenever found during work, the official team comes in and takes it out safely,” said Sean Palfrey, a Faculty Dean of Adams House.  “This is a fact of life, and as long as everyone is aware it could be there, the response is well-established.”
Gingo said asbestos removal does not only occur only during major building renovations— Eliot House is set to be examined this summer, according to Gingo.  This examination is part of an ongoing process that was started in the 1980s.

UPDATED: April 11, 2017 at 1:37 p.m. 
Two of the College’s pre-orientation programs, the First-Year Arts Program and the First-Year International Program, will have new directors when incoming students arrive to campus in the fall.
FIP will be led by Dwight Fee, a preceptor in Expository Writing who teaches Expository Writing 20: “Social World of Friendship at Harvard.” Fee received his Ph.D. in sociology from University of California, Santa Barbara and previously taught at Vassar and Middlebury Colleges.
Fee will succeed FIP’s current staff director, Jonah M. Johnson, who is also a preceptor in Expository Writing. Fee said his decision to take on the role was inspired by hearing about Johnson’s experience in the position.
“I think that this is a chance to affect a large number of people when they first step foot not only in the country, but on Harvard’s campus to really influence their experience in being part of a community when they arrive,” Fee said. “I can’t think of another position where I can be able to do something like this.”
American Repertory Theater administrator Julia Smeliansky will take over FAP from Dana E. Knox, a production coordinator at the Office for the Arts, who led the pre-orientation program for seven years.
Smeliansky says she is excited to lead the program—geared toward introducing freshmen to the arts at Harvard through master classes and workshops across the artistic disciplines—and sees the new opportunity as a way to showcase the arts to students who may not have had much prior experience in the field.
“With the establishment of the TDM concentration, I’ve been doing a lot of work with undergraduates and when this opportunity came up I thought it would be another chance to hopefully get to meet freshmen when they come in and have this opportunity to spread the love for arts,” Smeliansky said.
In addition to her position as the A.R.T.’s administrative director of the Institute for Advanced Theatre Training, Smeliansky is a lecturer on Theatre, Dance, and Media and has previously worked at the Moscow Art Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
The A.R.T. Institute drew attention in January when it received a “failing grade” from the U.S. Department of Education for the high amount of debt that graduates of the program left with, leading the A.R.T. to freeze admissions for fall 2017.
Katie W. Steele, director of College initiatives and student development, said both program directors will be responsible for coordinating between the Freshman Dean’s Office, student leaders who run the programs, and guests who provide programming workshops to participants. Steele oversees FDO pre-orientation programs and orientation week known as Opening Days.
The FAP and FIP directors will also oversee the financial affordability, physical accessibility, and budget of the programs, according to Steele.
“We hire folks who—because of either of already their responsibilities at Harvard, because of who they are, because of their past experiences—have a strong interest in the arts or the experience of international students,” Steele said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 11, 2017 at 7:50 p.m.
Mock notices from a purported “Harvard Special Investigations Unit” warning students that a resident of their dorm “has been detained indefinitely” sparked outrage from several students, who called the false flyers disturbing, and prompted the involved students groups to apologize.
Formally cosigned by Harvard Concilio Latino, the Harvard Islamic Society, and the Harvard Black Students Association and orchestrated by the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee, the flyer posed as a notice informing students about an ongoing investigation in the recipient’s dormitory.
“We regret to inform you that a resident of this dorm has been detained indefinitely due to suspicious actions, suspected violent inclinations, or suspicion of being a deportable alien (i.e. questionable residency status),” the flyers read.

The provocative notices—which included information about a panel Thursday on incarceration—went on to explain that though the flyers were not real, they hoped that the “unsettling nature” of the notice “allows Harvard community members to reflect on the reality of people who face these kinds of unwarranted disruptions.”
Voicing shock and fear, however, several students took issue with the controversial method for publicizing these topics.
Karla V. Alvarado ’19, who noted that she had previously dealt with a similar situation because both of her parents used to be undocumented, described feeling troubled.
“I was upset mostly because I think [the flyers] didn’t take into account the feelings of people who have actually seen deportation notices or experienced the risk of deportation, or have loved ones who are at risk of deportation—their responses were not taken into account,” she said.
Cecilia Nunez ’20 said she agreed.
“As a member of the Latinx and black communities, I was really disturbed by the format of the flyer and how terrifying it was for students of color and undocumented students especially to receive the notice,” Nunez said.
By Monday evening, some of the students groups connected to the flyer had publicly apologized. In a joint statement, the board of Concilio Latino wrote that the group had not been previously aware of the flyer’s exact contents and apologized for the harm it may have caused students.
“[The flyers] are fake, but the effects they may have had on any of you are beyond real and represent something entirely antithetical to what Concilio stands for,” the statement reads.
Fatima M. Bishtawi ’17, the co-president of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, wrote in an emailed statement that though there was a miscommunication with Concilio Latino, both of the other organizations, the Black Students Association and Harvard Islamic Society, “saw the flyer beforehand and approved it.”
In a statement on behalf of the entire Palestine Solidarity Committee, Bishtawi also apologized for the flyer’s contents.
“As organizers of this initiative, we would like to unequivocally apologize for any trauma and pain provoked by the seriousness of this notice,” the statement read.
The group added that the original intent of the flyers were to invoke the experiences of those who “do not always get to walk away from a notice knowing that it is fake.”
“The campaign was intended to communicate that these issues are real, they’re jarring, they're emotional, and that is the reality,” the group said. The statement noted that "those who drafted this notice are themselves affected by the issues of administrative detention, criminalization, state violence, and deportation."
Shantell Williams ’18, the president of the Black Students Association did not respond to repeated requests for comment as of late Monday night.
Zarin I. Rahman ’18, president of Harvard Islamic Society, directed requests for comment to Anwar Omeish ’19, the director of external relations for the group. Omeish did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The Palestine Solidarity Committee stopped distributing flyers after student criticism.
Past postering campaigns organized by the Palestine Solidarity Committee had met similar controversy. In 2013, the group faced backlash after using mock eviction notices to publicize that year’s Harvard Israel Apartheid week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly ten years after its inception, the Harvard Ed Portal, a Harvard service initiative in Allston, has grown to provide academic support to about 250 Allstonian students each year.
Founded in 2008 as part of a community benefits package Harvard agreed to in exchange for the ability to begin development in Allston, the program originally tutored about 25 Allstonian students. Today, the Ed Portal serves about ten times that many students and now includes clubs and summer activities in addition to after school mentoring.
Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey said the original idea for the Ed Portal came from within the Allston community.
“When Harvard was first contemplating expanding its campus… we engaged with the community to discuss what kinds of things they would expect and want from Harvard,” Casey said. “What rose to the top of the list was an interest in experiencing the kinds of interactions students experience in the campus.”
Robert A. Lue, a biology professor and the faculty director of the Harvard Ed Portal, said the program served both Allstonians and Harvard students.
“The mentoring program is really an opportunity for Harvard undergraduates to come together with children from the Allston neighborhood and jointly explore what it means to become passionate about learning,” Lue said.
Lue said the program’s original focus on science and writing has expanded to include the arts and other academic disciplines.
Terry Lee ’18, a mentor in the program, said mentors currently have four sessions a week with either one or two mentees, but they can also lead larger clubs. Lee leads a computer club; Ellen R. Jang-Milsten ’18, another mentor, leads a science of cooking club.
Jang-Milsten said many of the club ideas, including the science of cooking club, come from the undergraduates involved in the program. Lue described the process of creating clubs and activities as “co-creative,” involving mentors, mentees, and faculty support.
Tina R. Schneider, an Allston resident and mother of two daughters in the program, said that while she had heard negative sentiments in Allston surrounding Harvard’s development there, she supported Harvard’s presence.
“We started right when they started—first semester we were there, and we’re still there,” Schneider said.
Schneider added that her daughters have been involved in many facets of the program, including one-on-one mentoring, group mentoring, and club activities. Her elder daughter, Emma, worked a summer internship at the Ed Portal last summer. Emma said she was responsible for “helping to organize the space and taking care of some of the insects” in the program’s science center.
Schneider said her daughters were interested in science, and their exposure to female mentors and role models in science has been her favorite thing about the program. Her daughter Emma said she became so close with her first mentor that the Schneider family invited her over for dinner.
Emma also said the mentoring program exposed her to opportunities and resources she did not have access to in school. She said she has done dissections at the Harvard-Allston campus, but not in her high school.
Casey said one of the community’s ultimate marker of success for the program was to see a mentee attend Harvard. Kevin Y. Yang ’20 became the first Allston mentee to matriculate to Harvard this September.

Approximately two years since Harvard debuted a Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, its initial batches of concentrators largely laud the program, though some say it can be difficult to balance its academic and performance components.
Several TDM concentrators say they enjoy the attention and independence that the new concentration of only 21 students provides.
“It’s wonderful being in a small department and getting a lot of individualized attention,” said Julia E. Belanoff ’18, who studied at the National Theater Institute in the fall.
Sam A. Hagen ’18 voiced similar sentiments, and said he finds Harvard invested in the concentration’s growth.
“What is most exciting about TDM is the energy, attention, and resources that are being directed towards continuing to improve it,” Hagen said.
University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly voiced support for the concentration and the humanities broadly, providing $5 million in “seed funding” from her discretionary fund to start the concentration.
But even with the ample advising resources, students say it can be difficult to balance the theoretical and vocational aspects of the concentration.
Martin Puchner, a Drama and English professor who chairs Theater, Dance and Media, said the concentration looks to integrate “an academic, historical, literary study of theater, dance and media with actual art making and practice,” and added that courses “ask for a balance between those two things.”
Hagen, however, said he found that striking such a balance can be a challenge.
“I think the fundamental question or problem of having a TDM department is how do you incorporate performance work with academic work? That’s been a difficult question to grapple with in many ways, but the department have been very open to trying to address that question,” Hagen said.
Eliza B. Mantz ’18 also said she has had difficulties in beginning to propose a thesis.
“Constantly trying to negotiate with the department about what they want and what they need to see and what you’re passionate about and what you want to create a project on has been the most challenging part of trying to come up with a thesis,” she said. “The department isn’t exactly sure what a TDM thesis looks like.”
Sarah K. Grammar ’18 also said “the Committee is discovering with us what a TDM thesis can be.”
But overall, TDM students say they enjoy the enthusiasm shared by those within the young concentration.
“I’ve had to construct my own path in college. I’ve loved the freedom of a new concentration and how its parameters are flexible,” Belanoff said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you're a fan of matches that are over before they begin, I would advise against following the Harvard women's tennis team. The Crimson remained unbeaten in conference play with a pair of 4-3 wins, edging out Brown on Friday indoors in Providence before topping archrival Yale outside at the Beren Tennis Center two days later.
Following its performance over the weekend, Harvard (15-6, 3-0 Ivy League) moved into sole possession of first place in the Ivy League with four matches to play. It was the Crimson’s first road win over the Bears (11-6, 2-1) and the team’s first home victory over the Bulldogs (7-12, 0-3) since 2013. The 3-0 start to Ivy League play is Harvard’s best since 2011.
“Every match has been 4-3 and it really makes practice that much more intense,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We know the matches are going to be tight, which makes our practices tough every day. We have the mindset of preparing for every match like it’s going to be 4-3.”
HARVARD, 4, YALE, 3
The Brown-Yale weekend always presents a strange scheduling situation for Harvard. While the team’s other two 2-match Ivy League weekends have contests on consecutive days, the annual weekend series with the Bears and Bulldogs feature a home and away match with an off-day in between.
The extra day of practice appeared to benefit the Crimson early on. Harvard secured the doubles point for the second consecutive match. Captain June Lee and Erica Oosterhout cleaned up at first doubles, winning all six games over Tina Jiang and Elizabeth Zordani. Junior Annika Ringblom and sophomore Sabrina Xiong continued the dominance, topping Caroline Lynch and Amy Yang, 6-1.
“It’s always a battle playing against Yale,” Green said. “It was probably the best doubles we’ve played all season. We were fortunate enough to carry that momentum into the singles and compete down the line at every position.”
Despite the early lead, the Crimson would lose three of the first five singles matches and allowed its guests to knot the match at three points apiece. The final result would come down to Harvard freshman Natasha Gonzalez and fellow first-year Opala Dhingra. With each player competing in just her third Ivy League match, Gonzalez proved cooler under pressure. The Houston native took her match’s first set 6-4 and closed out Dhingra with a 6-2 win in the second.
Gonzalez was not the only freshman to step up for the Crimson on Sunday. Another good sign for Green came in the play of freshman Lexi Milunovich. The Greenwich, Conn., native played in her first match in almost two months last weekend against Dartmouth and returned to doubles action on Friday. Milunovich picked up her first Ivy League singles win against the Bulldogs, edging junior Valerie Shklover in each of their two sets.
“Having Lexi back in the lineup has been a tremendous boost for our squad,” Green said. “She’s an energetic player with a lot of experience so we’ve really felt her presence. It’s been great to have her back.”
Sophomore Erica Oosterhout kept her perfect conference record intact after besting Yale junior Carol Finke, 7-5, 6-1. The win capped off an undefeated weekend for the Tampa native. Oosterhout is one of just twoIvy League players to have three wins at first singles.
Lee saw her nine-match win streak come to an end against the Bulldogs. The senior fell to Yang at second singles in a marathon match, 7-6, 5-7, 10-4. The fourth and fifth positions also went to the Elis. Freshman Irene Lu dropped her match to Jiang, 6-3, 6-4, while Ringblom was ousted by Zordani, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1.
HARVARD, 4, BROWN, 3
Brown and Harvard had met earlier in the spring at the ECAC Championships at the Murr Center. The Bears topped the Crimson, 4-1, back on Feb. 12, but Harvard won when it mattered. After losing the doubles point in the teams’ first go-round, the Crimson came out firing on Friday afternoon in Providence.
Harvard took the day’s first two doubles matches with Milunovich and Gonzalez capturing a victory in their first action as a pair and Ringblom and Xiong winning at No. 3. Despite holding the one-point edge early, Friday’s match with Brown proved to be yet another nailbiter for Green’s Cardiac Crew.
“There’s always that back-and-forth, game-for-game situation,” Lee said. “That’s just always how Ivies is. The games are all really important. We’ve had good practice for that from our previous matches and it’s just a matter right now of trusting what we’ve been doing and believing in our practices.”
The Crimson got strong play from its top players against the Bears. Three of its top four players picked up victories with Oosterhout and Lee leading the way at first and second singles. After having her way with senior Dayna Lord early on, Oosterhout needed a tiebreaker in the second set to secure the straight set win. After sitting out doubles action for the first time this spring, Lu took care of business at the No. 4 singles spot. The Laurel, Md., native topped Brown freshman Devon Jack, 6-2, 6-4.
Lee ended up securing the clincher for the Crimson on Friday, a fitting result for the team’s lone senior who entered the match riding an eight-match singles win streak. The West Windsor, N.J., native was consistent in her takedown of the Bears’ Alyza Benotto, edging the junior, 6-4, 6-4.
“We all got really good starts in singles,” Lee said. “We knew that Brown was going to put up a good fight so we were just trying to step on the gas and keep the pressure on.”
Milunovich dropped her second consecutive match at No. 3, falling to Brown junior Maddie Stearns. Ringblom and the Bears’ Katie Ta played the day’s only three-set match, with the Harvard junior ultimately falling 10-7 in the third. Gonzalez ended up on the wrong end in each of her two back-and-forth sets against Brown sophomore Taylor Cosme.
“I’m really proud of the way our gang fought against Brown,” Green said. “Brown has some really solid doubles and we were excited to see all of our hard work. We came out fairly strong and really took it to them. I was really proud of the way we competed overall.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 13, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Rebecca Nadler '14 was inducted into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame. Nadler will not be eligible for this honor until 2029.
Rebecca Nadler '14 will become the first Harvard skier to be chosen to the newly created William S. Broadbent Family Harvard Skiing All-Time Team. She will be honored later this year.
The class of 2017 inductee quickly became a dominant force in NCAA women’s alpine skiing beginning her freshman year. The Ottawa, Ont., native opened her collegiate career with a fourth-place finish at her first giant slalom race at the St. Lawrence Winter Carnival. She also had strong showings at giant slalom races at the Colby Winter Carnival before qualifying for the NCAA Championships during the 2010-2011 campaign.
Nadler only continued to achieve more success her sophomore year. She opened the 2011-2012 season with a sixth-place finish in the giant slalom event at the Bates Winter Carnival as well as with two second place finishes and a win at various other races before qualifying for the NCAA Championships for the second year in a row.
As a sophomore, the Nadler became the first Harvard skier, male or female, to win a national championship with a first place finish in the giant slalom event in Montana. Her winning time of 1:41.82 also earned her All-American status for the season. Nadler was also just the fourth woman from the Eastern Region of the NCAA to win the giant slalom title. She placed seventh in the slalom event to cap off her unprecedented campaign.
Nadler kept earning more accolades in the rest of her Harvard career, qualifying both her junior and senior year for the NCAA Championships. Ending her collegiate career on a high note, she once again received All-American status with a sixth place finish in the giant slalom event at the NCAA Championships her senior year.
The All-American and 2011 National Champion graduated in 2014 with a degree in neurobiology.

Fields, courts, mats, pools, tracks, rivers, and courses—Harvard student-athletes compete on all kinds of environments. And in each location, a predictable cast of characters helps the Crimson to success.
Head coaches guide, assistant coaches supplement, strength trainers toughen, and sports medicine professionals heal. Then, of course, there are the athletes themselves through which performances culminate.
This list is not complete, however.  The efforts of one particular group of individuals affiliated with Harvard athletics goes largely unnoticed.
For the Crimson’s baseball, basketball, cross country, squash, women’s tennis, track and field, and water polo teams, student managers are an integral cog in the machine. By streamlining  practices and helping with sideline management during games, these student managers simplify the lives of coaches and athletes—and make success that much easier.
Attention to detail is key when aiding in the everyday process. Student managers thrive in working on the small, sometimes overlooked aspects of a team. For the managers, it’s all just part of the job. Just ask senior Peyton Fine, a student manager for men’s basketball.
“I think it starts with just having everything ready for practice and that’s sort of the day-in, day-out of the role,” senior Peyton Fine said. “A lot of the time before practice the guys will do a lift, so we’ll be there towards the end of their lift just making sure waters are out, that the court is clean, that different extra equipment that we use during the practice is set up…. Within the games, it’s our job to make sure the bench is set up, making sure during timeouts that we…bring out the stools onto the court.”
Fine and the rest of the men’s basketball student management cohort tirelessly work to ensure the needs of the coaching staff and players are met such that the squad can perform to the best of its abilities without having to worry as much about the little things.
Managers on other teams provide similar assistance, but no manager is confined merely to aiding in equipment and electrolyte transfer.
For sophomore Rana Bansal, the No. 2 men’s squash manager, a typical practice day could involve anything from filming sessions to refereeing intra-squad matches, or even playing on-court with some members of the team. On match day, his responsibilities tend to revolve around score reporting and lending support to the team.
Fine has a more expansive role within the men’s basketball team, as well, as he handles much of the deeper analytics reporting that coaches rely on to color their decision-making processes.
“During the game, we’re tracking all the substitutions that come in and out of the game so we can do line-up efficiencies and line-up plus-minuses,” Fine said. “That’s a stat that in a lot of bigger conferences the media will take care of. If you have like the ACC, the Big Ten, or Big 12, there’s such a media presence at those games, that [they] can usually track those stats.... The one thing we don’t have [in the Ivy League] is [a lot of media coverage], so that’s something we have to do internally.”
Without much media coverage of Ancient Eight matchups, student managers are there to pick up the slack where it’s needed. Statistical tracking, statistical analysis, and score reporting can just another part of their role.
The ways in which such a role manifests itself can constantly change. Clearly, the duties of a singular student manager depend on the requirements of his or her individual team. Methodologies and personalities vary from team to team and sport to sport, resulting in different experiences across the board.
“I think being team manager entirely depends on the team you are working with, because each team has different needs and requirements for its players,” Bansal said. “I have been able to get close with the guys on the team and feel very strongly about making sure that we are successful not only in matches but the way the squad feels and approaches each match.”
Student managers become part of the fabric of their respective teams, and are treated as such. As their experience builds and familiarity grows, the certainty of this statement deepens even further.
Even so, the managers must live in multiple worlds. As an extension of the coaching staff, they have administrative responsibilities. But as Harvard students, they seem more liable to develop natural bonds with athletes. In reality, according to Fine, they foster solid connections with both parties, albeit connections of a dissimilar nature.
“Age-wise and experience-wise you’re going through the same things [as] the players. However, the person that we’re taking our direction from is a member of the coaching staff­—you do live in both worlds,” Fine said. “In terms of integration, we travel with the team just like a player would, we are at every practice just like a player would be, and just like a coach would be… There’s no way you can’t be [integrated] when you spend that kind of time, and so you do end up with both sides.”
Building these bonds allows student managers to access the wealth of experience and fellowship that the Crimson’s coaches and student-athletes have to provide.
“Being team manager means that you get to work closely with the coaching staff, which has been great especially for squash because the coaches are among the best in the world,” Bansal said. “At Harvard the coaching resources are almost unparalleled in the time and effort they dedicate into making sure you are successful as a student both in the athletic facilities and outside in the classroom and your personal life.”
In terms of commitment, the role can be taxing, as managers must spend a similar magnitude of time involved in sport as their student-athlete counterparts.
However, coaching staffs often offer some flexibility, recognizing that time can be scarce commodity for Harvard students.
“There’s a level of commitment that’s expected, but our coaches are really good about working with us,” Fine said. “As Harvard students, this is one of many things we have going on, and our coaching staff is really good about meeting us where we’re at.”
The Harvard Athletics Department isn’t the only entity that benefits from the relationship. For the managers, the experience can be rewarding, as well. They not only get to be involved in a sport that they love but also get some satisfaction from knowing that they are a part of the formula of their team’s success.
The position is also a platform to build upon one’s understanding of how a sport should be played. After observing firsthand how the coaches and players respond to different situations during practices and games, managers absorb pockets of useful information. Knowledge accrues, and working relationships build.
“I learned a ton about the game of basketball just by doing this,” Fine said. “I expected to gain basketball knowledge and [knowledge of] what a professional life in basketball could look like. I got that, but I also got so much more…. The relationships that I got out of it were way more than I expected.”
For those passionate about an individual sport, taking on a student manager position has seemed to have been gratifying route to stay involved through a role with the Crimson varsity squad. But according to Bansal, in terms of the experience, you get out of it what you put in.
“I would encourage others to pursue a role as team manager if they are really passionate about the sport and the team,” Bansal said. “The role is definitely worthwhile if you love the game you are spending time following, and tracking and the success of the experience depends on what you make of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Just as Harvard softball returned to Cambridge, so too did New England’s spring weather. As the cold slowly began to dissipate, Harvard slowly heated up, improving from last weekend’s 1-3 showing to go 2-2 in two doubleheaders.
It was a tale of two opponents for Harvard (11-14, 3-5 Ivy) this weekend. The Crimson dominated Cornell (6-17, 1-7) in the Saturday doubleheader, piling on 17 combined runs and holding the Big Red to eight. However, Harvard was no match for defending Ivy champion Princeton (13-13, 6-2) on Sunday, as the Tigers’ powerful pitching and hitting were both on display in the Sunday doubleheader.
Despite the ups and downs of the weekend, one constant was sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich, who was named Athlete of the Week. The El Segundo, Calif. native had nine hits in 14 at bats, including two triples.
She scored four runs and drove in three more, and she also extended her errorless streak to 25 games to start the season.
Rich currently leads the Ivy League in batting average with a .437 mark, and she stands at seventh in stolen bases with seven.
“She’s just been steady for us,” head coach Jenny Allard said. “She makes big plays, she comes up clutch hitting, she has a lot of fight in her, she’s real competitive. She was one of the few that really stepped up this weekend.”
PRINCETON 6, HARVARD 2
In the final game of the weekend, the Crimson fought tooth and nail with Princeton until the top of the sixth, when the Tigers rallied for three runs to put the game out of reach for the host team.
Down 3-1 in the top of the fourth, Harvard appeared poised to erase its deficit. Princeton senior Erica Nori allowed a leadoff walk to sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively. With one gone, sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart roped a double to straightaway center, putting runners on second and third. A single off the bat of senior designated hitter Catherine Callaway chased in freshman pinch runner Chanel Varney to bring the Crimson within one.
However, Nori slammed the door on Harvard in the fourth, getting the final two outs of her day via groundout and flyout to strand two runners in scoring position.
Any hopes the Crimson had of building on its fourth inning momentum were dashed by Tiger sophomore righthander Riley Wilkinson. Coming on in relief for Nori, Wilkinson coasted through three scoreless innings to pick up her first save of the season.
Princeton rallied for three runs on four hits in the top of the sixth to extend its lead to 6-2. For the second time in two games, Harvard was unable to surpass two runs scored.
“I think every game from here moving forward is going to be a learning process,” co-captain Giana Panariello said. “We’re going to have to fight to win games. It’s a tough conference this year.”
Rich added her ninth hit of the weekend in the back half of Sunday’s twinbill, and she also contributed a sacrifice bunt.
Despite allowing six runs, four of which were earned, sophomore southpaw Katie Duncan tossed a complete game for Harvard, striking out seven in the process. Following its 11-run effort in the first game, the Tigers outdid themselves by notching 12 in this contest.
PRINCETON 10, HARVARD 2
(6 innings)
Princeton erupted for ten runs on 11 hits to down the Crimson in the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader.
The Tigers put up its second three-run inning in the top of the sixth. Fueled by doubles from sophomore first baseman Kaylee Grant and sophomore catcher Keeley Walsh, Princeton grabbed an eight-run lead, which gave the Tigers a shortened six-inning win when Harvard failed to score in the last of the sixth.
Princeton senior righthander Claire Klausner got the start in the circle, and she picked up her sixth win of the year. She kept the ball in play throughout her start, only striking out one, but she also kept Harvard off the basepaths by limiting the Crimson to five hits and one free pass.
“They moved the ball around the zone, and they got our hitters to swing at bad pitches,” Allard said, referring to the Tigers’ pitching. “When we did square the ball up, we hit it right to people, but most of the time they got us to hit what they wanted us to hit.”
Plating three runs in the top of the first, the Princeton offense fired on all cylinders from the beginning of the game.
Grant pulled a ball over the fence in right-center in her turn at bat, a two-run shot that gave Princeton a 3-0 lead.
One of the bright spots for Harvard’s offense in this contest was once again the sophomore shortstop. Rich went three-for-three with a double and a run scored.
HARVARD 9, CORNELL 5
A third inning comeback and a sixth inning rally propelled the Crimson to a sweep of Cornell on Saturday.
After Harvard squandered a one-run advantage in the fourth, the Crimson found itself knotted at five with the Big Red through five and a half innings. With two outs and a runner on third, Harvard looked to reclaim the lead heading into the final inning.
Two walks loaded the bases for Panariello. Before the Bay Shore, N.Y. native could get a chance to break the tie, however, Cornell pitcher Cora Geunes delivered a wild pitch, allowing Lockhart to touch home with the Crimson’s sixth run of the game.
Now facing a second-and-third situation, Panariello ripped a single into right field to plate two more, and she was chased in on Rich’s second triple of the contest to stretch Harvard’s lead to 9-5.
“I think obviously we had some good breaks,” Panariello said. “They had some breakdowns that we really capitalized on. This year is all about passing the bat to the next girl and knowing that she can get it done as much as you.”
The Crimson had the opportunity to secure the victory in the sixth because of its come-from-behind effort in the bottom of the third. With one run on the board, Rich stung the ball into the left-center gap. The ball rolled all the way to the wall, and two runs crossed home to cut the Big Red’s lead to one. Junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan drove in Rich with a ground-ball double past Cornell’s third baseman. In total, Harvard racked up five runs on three hits in the inning.
Duncan tossed seven innings, striking out five and walking none.
Rich notched three hits in four at bats, including two triples and three runs batted in.
Harvard continued to run wild on the Big Red’s catchers. This time around, sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer swiped two bags, and Panariello added one.
HARVARD 8, CORNELL 3
Rebounding from its 1-3 showing a week ago, the Crimson recorded a convincing 8-3 victory over Cornell in the weekend opener.
“It was nice for us to bounce back yesterday against Cornell,” Allard said. “I thought we had a lot of confidence at the plate and really attacked certain pitches well, and our pitchers kept us in the game.”
After scoring just 12 runs in four games against Penn and Columbia, Harvard erupted for eight runs on 14 hits against the Big Red. Kaplan went four-for-five with a run scored and an RBI.
The Crimson got on the board first in the bottom of the opening frame with two runs. Harvard was aided by some errant pitching from Cornell’s starter Maddie Orcutt, who walked three and hit one batter in the inning.
The Crimson opened up the floodgates in the second inning, effectively putting the game out of reach with a four-run outburst.
With runners on first and third, Shively tripled to right field to clear the bases. Lockhart followed Shively with a shot to left, good for two bases and an RBI. Later in the inning, junior left fielder Dallas Hogan knocked in Lockhart with a single back up the middle.
Harvard’s offensive outburst was not entirely necessary, however, as senior hurler Taylor Cabe cruised to her third win of the season.
Cabe allowed two runs over six innings, and freshman Olivia Giaquinto came on in the ninth to finish off the Big Red.
The Crimson was active on the basepaths in this contest. Rich stole her seventh bag of the year, and Panariello swiped two more. Rich also contributed two hits, scored two runs, and drew a base on balls.
