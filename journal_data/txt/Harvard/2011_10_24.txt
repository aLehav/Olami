After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Björk fans need not worry—the Icelandic singer hasn’t stopped being really, really weird.
The release of her newest album, “Biophilia,” is accompanied by an app for iOS devices that bills itself as an “extraordinary and innovative multimedia exploration of music, nature, and technology.” If you ever wanted to listen to her music while watching a dramatic video of DNA replication or you wanted to use lightning to create the same arpeggios she uses in her music, you won’t be disappointed.
But though the “Biophilia” app sets out to bring a different dimension to her newest release with a litany of visual and technological effects, the connection between the app and the album is tenuous at best.
The app is organizationally centered on a sprawling three-dimensional structure of meandering lines, odd shapes, and multicolored stars, each of which represents one of the tracks from the album. The structure can be navigated by zooming in with a two-finger pinch or rotating it with one finger. As you zoom in closer to a star, its corresponding track begins to play.
Tapping one of the stars takes you to its submenu, which presents a short blurb about the song. Each application also comes with two longer passages: a general explication of the relationship between the app and the song, and the other a “musical analysis” of the song’s form, texture, and composition. These passages are some of the most redeeming aspects of the application. They provide an accessible and often fascinating window into the creative process behind an artist known for her cerebral esotericism.
In addition to the writing, each menu presents four options: play, score, animation, and credits. “Animation” takes you to a screen that scrolls by with colored bars and circles that light up in time to the song and in positions that indicate the relative pitch of the instruments. “Score” takes you to a screen that shows the individual notes and rhythms of the songs on a collection of staves, albeit in a stripped-down version that substitutes the actual instruments and vocals for more easily transcribed MIDI tracks.
But the heart of the “Biophilia” application lies in the “Play” feature, which takes the user to some sort of interactive activity—sometimes a game, sometimes a clip, sometimes just something to mess around with.
Most of them are entertaining for a little bit, but they don’t really go anywhere. The “Sacrifice” app is a bunch of shapes that play a very short sample of a sound from the song when pressed. You can organize them into sequences and play them back, but you can’t play any two sounds simultaneously, so the end result is less a creative rearrangement of the original and more an incoherent mess of sounds. The “Virus” app consists of a bunch of cells that slowly become invaded by viruses that you’re supposed to fight off. The whole thing happens very slowly, though, so it isn’t very engaging.
A few of the apps are genuinely fun and interesting. The “Crystalline” app is basically what “Katamari Damacy” would look like if Björk had designed it—you roll a crystal through tunnels collecting other crystals of various colors as the song plays. And the app for “Dark Matter” will entrance music theory enthusiasts with its thirteen glowing stars, each of which represents a note in the chromatic scale. When you touch one of the stars, a series of colored lines emerges from it and connects to other stars. Each different color represents a different kind of scale, from standard major and pentatonic scales to exotic scales like “ultra-Locrian” and “Egyptian.”
Ultimately, though, the interactive features never feel like they connect to the songs on any level other than the superficial. Yes, the song is called “Crystalline” and its app has something to do with crystals, but it’s here that the interaction between the music and software ends.
The “Biophilia” app will more than satisfy diehard Björk fans (Ed. Note: all 13)—between the written materials and the “score” and “animation” features, it opens up a window into the music that most artists never give their fans, at least not to this extent. And it’s all in a package that very much fits with Björk’s bizarre aesthetic.
But if you weren’t a Björk fan before, you probably won’t know what to make of the “Biophilia” app. For all that it intends to add to the listening experience, it ends up being a collection of reasonably cool to genuinely fascinating things that ultimately have very little to do with the album itself.
It’s true that trying to integrate music, technology, and visual effects into a coherent experience is a tall order. But for the relatively steep $10 price it costs to unlock all of the songs and for the 725 megabytes it will eat up on your device’s memory, the result is a bit of a letdown.

“The Mighty Macs,” a G-rated portrayal of Immaculata College’s successful run for the American Association Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) basketball championship in 1972, was produced in 2009, but is only now making its way into theaters more than two years later. It is doubtful, however, that this delay was due to studio infighting or lawsuits or any sort of interesting behind-the-scenes drama. More likely, someone just left the film on a shelf and forgot about it. The oversight would make sense, since “The Mighty Macs” is one of the most incredibly forgettable sports movies to be released in quite some time.
The film stars Carla Gugino as Cathy Rush, the new basketball coach at Immaculata, a Catholic all-women’s college. Rush has no previous coaching experience, but by stringing together nearly every sports movie trope ever conceived, she is able to—spoiler alert—lead her underdog team to a national championship. Along the way, the film features subplots about her over-emphasized troubled marriage to her husband Ed (David Boreanaz) as well as inconsequential culture clashes with the austere nuns who run the school.
But in actuality, the movie is just a collage of clichés compiled by writer-director Tim Chambers. Here they are:
First, the school is very poor. We know this because it has only one basketball and no gym, and because one character unsubtly remarks that “it will take an act of God to save this school.”
Second, there is the obligatory nun who is having a crisis of faith. She prays to God for a sign, gets annoyed by the noise of the basketball practice interrupting her supplications, then realizes that the practice is the sign and becomes the assistant coach.
Third, the team’s coaches make them do drills in unconventional places, “Karate Kid”-style; the assistant coach, the improbably named Sister Sunday (Marley Shelton), predictably tells Cathy that she’s pushing the kids too far.
Fourth, there’s that classic scene where it seems like nobody is going to show up to practice, but then it turns out that the entire team is already inside practicing. Oh, and the team gets really good after a montage!
Fifth, by the end of the movie, the school’s obligatory Mean Nun (Ellen Burstyn) is won over, and shown to be totally on board with the team when she pays for them to get to their final tournament.
Sixth, Cathy has to face off against her old coach who once told her that she wasn’t good enough, and who now happens to be the head of the highest-ranked team in the tournament. And finally, of course, there is that final shot where the basketball arcs in slow motion, all the sound drops out, and then the basketball goes into the hoop and the team wins the championship at the buzzer.
Add to this bevy of banality the fact that the film doesn’t actually seem to know much about basketball. The team has the basics, but Cathy Rush, Esteemed Basketball Coach, doesn’t actually give a lot of specific advice. Her coaching canon consists solely of vague inspirational statements like “We have to stand up for what we believe in!” and “Play our game … We can win this thing!” On the overhead court diagram in the locker room, the assistant coach literally just writes the word “BELIEVE” over it. That is the Mighty Macs’ game plan: believe.
Well, believe it or not, with such spellbinding plotting as this, “The Mighty Macs” is just plain boring. There is never anything at stake—even viewers with absolutely no knowledge of the film’s historical background know that the girls are going to win, thanks to the movie’s heavy-handed previews and storytelling—and there is nothing innovative about how it portrays the value of sports. “The Mighty Macs” is just an ineffectual, inoffensive basketball movie pieced together out of pieces of other, better sports movies. There’s not much else to say about a film whose final line is—I kid you not—“Anything can happen when we’re committed to our dreams.”

In 1846, Edgar Allan Poe championed the short story in his essay "The Philosophy of Composition," noting that this form was in fact superior to the novel because a short story is capable of being read in a single sitting. Poe's mind would be blown if he knew that more and more authors are turning their attention to the art of the Tweet, a form capable of being read in a single second. Here are some of the more interesting Twitter accounts headed by literary types.
Neil Gaiman (@Neilhimself)
The English fantasy author who has written everything from alternative comic books to children's novels now constrains his writing talents to 140 characters or less. He mainly talks to his friends and self-promotes, but there's occasionally an odd bit of wisdom.
Sample tweets:
— "Woke up. Hair EVEN more unlikely than usual. Normally if I have full on crazy hair it means rain. This may mean waterspouts or twisters." (Oct. 6)
— "They turned off the security cameras in the Degas exhibition so my wife could take her clothes off while I sketched her in chalks. #herIdea" (Oct. 4)
Judy Blume (@JudyBlume)
There are two things you need to know about this perennially challenged young adult novelist. First, that there are a lot of tweets about banned books. Secondly, that Blume often sounds like your parents do when they text.
Sample tweets:
— "Husband says: You and your tweeting makes me laugh! He laughs so hard bed shakes.  (What?!)" (Sept. 25)
— "On train to Baltimore. Person behind me is in lengthy phone conversation about work w/someone named Frank. he is in Trouble." (Sept. 16)
Bret Easton Ellis (@BretEastonEllis)
The controversial author of "American Psycho" and "Less Than Zero" built his reputation on novels that focused on human vice and depravity. His Twitter, on the other hand, is concerned mainly with the movies and popular music he enjoys. We all need to let our hair down sometimes.
Sample tweets:
— "Went to a screening of "Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)" and yeah it's the grossest movie ever made but also kind of likable and charming." (Oct. 6)
— "But really My Chemical Romance's "Disenchanted" is the best power-ballad of the last ten years." (Sept. 14)
Margaret Atwood (@MargaretAtwood)
Frequent Booker Prize candidate Margaret Atwood, best known for books such as "The Handmaid's Tale," has one of the more literature-oriented accounts. Perhaps that's why she has such trouble keeping thoughts under 140 characters.
Sample tweets:
— "Help! Identify a story in which a stranger hides on a boat, appears only at night to tell of a woman he failed - keys are pregnancy, coffin" (Oct. 1)
— "The story I seek is not scifi. Might be 19th C or early 20th C. The boat is returning from some "colony"or other. The hiding man is a doctor" (Oct. 1)
— "Okay, giving up for the moment. Can query person in whose house book with the story resides. Will take time. Let you know answer when found." (Oct. 1)
Steve Martin (@SteveMartinToGo)
At this point, it's fair to describe the comedian Steve Martin as an author—he's written a novella that was well-received by the New York Times, a play that was well-received by the New Yorker, and many short pieces that were published in The New Yorker. Likewise, his Twitter has been acclaimed by the New York media.
Sample tweets:
— "After much thought, I have decided to use my sense of humor for good rather than evil." (Oct 1)
— "Just hired three ex-News of the World employees to get my voice messages.  So much easier." (Oct 1)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Deborah Bright is a professor of both  photography and history of art and visual culture at the Rhode Island School of Design, but this semester she joins the Harvard community as a visiting professor in the department of Visual and Environmental Studies. A critic, writer, and photographer, Bright has combined her liberal arts education with an interest in history to examine topics that range from queer sexualities to the Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. This Thursday at 6 p.m. in the Carpenter Center, she will be giving a talk centered on selections from her latest photographic exhibition, “Destruction Layer.”
The Harvard Crimson: Did you always study photography?
Deborah Bright: I actually first studied and got my [Master of Fine Arts] in painting. However, it was the mid-1970s, and painting was in crisis at that time because it sort of reached the end of what I would call “high formalism” as the dominant aesthetic. That’s what I had been trained in, but I had always found it very unsatisfactory because it completely avoided issues of content in the work. It was all about the formal structure, how it was put together. It being the ’70s with the culmination of the social change movements and the anti-Vietnam political upheaval, I was very frustrated as a painter that we weren’t dealing with issues of the world that we live in. It was very ivory-tower, very remote.
THC: So what eventually led you to photography?
DB: While I was in graduate school, I helped one of the professors mount an exhibition of Walker Evans’ s photographs from the Library of Congress. Getting involved with Evans’s work was really key … for me because he was a photographer who combined a very sophisticated sense of graphic form with very telling content. The two worked together beautifully. I had taken a photography course many years earlier in college, but it just hadn’t clicked with me. Coming to his photographs after this intensive training as a painter, I really said, “That’s my medium.”
THC: You will be giving a talk next week relating to your participation in the Carpenter Center’s Exhibition “New Visiting Faculty 2011/12.” Could you give a little preview of what you will be speaking about?
DB: The work I’m going to be talking about on Thursday is about Palestine and Israel, and it has involved years of conversation and research and investigation. This is a project that I see as continuing an exploration of landscape as a sight of trauma, both historical and political. What I was interested in was the battlefield and what it is now. Is it a site that is a holy place, that’s a kind of sacred monument to slain martyrs, or is it a place where the local people lost and were dominated? These are exactly the thick and problematic kinds of historical stories that I want to excavate.
THC: What drew you to this particular project?
DB: I was involved in a long-term relationship with a third-generation Israeli. I made my first trip to Israel in 2005 just as a tourist and yet also went there with this sensibility of someone who looks at landscape through the prism of historical complexity. We kept noticing that as we visited official tourist places, quite often there were ruins nearby that weren’t marked. It dawned on us that these were remains of Palestinian villages that had been depopulated in 1948. These remains of the villages really intrigued us and so we came back and did some research on the history of Palestine before most of it was absorbed into the state of Israel.
THC: Some of your earlier work deals with homosexuality and society. What was your inspiration for those endeavors?
DB: I had just come out as a lesbian in 1985, so I was fairly new—fresh, one might say—to coming to terms with my sexuality. There was a project that I really wanted to do: it was to take old film stills from movies that I had watched growing up and insert myself into them as a character, thereby problematizing the heterosexual economy of the scene. This was the ’80s, so again there was a lot of discourse in film studies and photographic studies about the gender of the gaze in film spectatorship. I wanted to kind of disrupt the heterosexual terms that were being discussed. I created what came to be known as the “Dream Girls Project,”
which was based on my memories of even before I could name queer desire [but still] felt it and identified with it. This project came to … have a wonderful life beyond what I imagined.
THC: How has your experience been teaching here at Harvard?
DB: I love working with Harvard students because they are so bright, and they do the ground work. Sometimes, they want to know what the expectations are so that they know how to surpass them. It’s a little more linear, a little more goal-oriented. They won’t immediately try to be show-offs the way art students will. Of course, the world here is a much more logical, logos-centered universe. There are interesting differences between students here at Harvard and those at schools of art and design, but I don’t think one way is a better way to be an artist than the other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent interview with The Guardian, Carol Ann Duffy, Britain’s Poet Laureate, compared poetry to text messaging. According to Duffy, “The poem is a form of texting…it’s the original text…It’s a perfecting of feeling in language—it’s a way of saying more with less, just as texting is. We've got to realise that the Facebook generation is the future—and, oddly enough, poetry is the perfect form for them. It's a kind of time capsule—it allows feelings and ideas to travel big distances in a very condensed form." Duffy suggests that today’s young people have a great deal of potential as poets because they—well, we actually have been, through texting and tweeting and updating Facebook statuses, inadvertently practicing and perfecting our ability to express ourselves in a limited number of words. We have, according to Duffy, inadvertently developed poetic skills by crystallizing and condensing our ideas.
Maybe young people in Britain text differently than we do in America. But I would hardly compare my own experiences with text message conversations to poetry. The text messages my friends and I exchange do, indeed, convey ideas and emotions in a condensed format. But, in order to share our thoughts in 140 characters or less and to spend as little time typing as possible, we disregard rules of sentence structure, grammar, and spelling. My first instinct would be to say that my text messages contain absolutely nothing that could be called “poetry”. Sometimes, they’re hardly intelligible English. But reading Duffy’s interview made me think, made me wonder that if I were perhaps to examine some of my past text conversations, I might be able to identify anything poetic in my messages or messages from friends.
Text Message: “Im busy today. Going tmrw. When r u going? ”
Analysis: Perhaps the omission of the apostrophe in the contraction “Im” suggests that existence—conveyed by the word “am”—is not just related to identity, as the word “I’m” might suggest, but rather is so inextricably linked to identity that it is impossible to differentiate the two. This text also includes an interesting commentary on temporality. “Tmrw” takes up far less literal space on the page (er, cell phone screen) than “tomorrow,” and the absence of vowels decreases the likelihood of a reader’s potentially instinctive tendency to “hear” the word inside his or her head while reading.  “Today” is not shortened and, consequently, contains one more letter than “tmrw.” Therefore, it might be argued that the present tense, in this passage (er, text message), signifies that the present situation conveyed in the text message takes precedence over what may conditionally happen in the future. The second sentence of the message contains an additional example of the use of spelling to alter the meaning of a word. By writing “u” instead of “you,” the author devalues the significance of the Other.
…Or maybe not.
Maybe the omission of vowels and apostrophes signifies nothing more than the desire to spend less time typing the message. And by maybe, I mean definitely.
Although I doubt that text messages bear any resemblance to poems, that does not mean that Duffy is incorrect in describing poetry as a form of texting. Poetry involves vividly conveying emotions and ideas by using a limited number of words. Accordingly, text messaging might theoretically be a medium well- suited to the production and dissemination of poetry—and I would argue that it could also be well-suited to fiction as well. Great literature can be written in 140 characters or less. There’s the classic Hemingway story: “For sale: Baby shoes, never worn.” A brilliant story and only 37 characters long. And Margaret Atwood: “Longed for him. Got him. Shit.” Thirty words.
Although the poem may be “the original text,” I don’t think that text messages stand much of a chance of being vehicles for poetic expression or for developing poetic skills. For better or for worse, the role and use of text messages in our society is too firmly ingrained in our collective consciousness. However, other, newer platforms—Twitter, for example—have much more potential as vehicles for poetic and literary experimentation. Many poets and authors already use Twitter in order to share short pieces of writing and verse. In order to expose children to this way of using Twitter for creative writing and to encourage them to do so as well, school curriculums must adapt and include social networks in the school curriculum. Text messaging, too, needs to be a part of education. Schools must place extra emphasis on teaching spelling, grammar, and sentence structure in order to counteract the spillover of text-speak into academic and creative writing. It may be impossible to eliminate text-speak, but it is imperative that educational energy should be directed toward teaching young people to limit their use of text-speak to text messages—and to know how to write properly otherwise. This will then allow young people to engage in creative exploration—and even create poetry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In almost any Harvard class—across disciplines and course levels—one can see students checking Facebook, reading the New York Times, or checking their Gmail during lecture. The degree of internet browsing—something I like to call the Facebook Index—varies widely from class to class, and from student to student. However, by and large, Facebook during class has become so ubiquitous that no one even questions it.
Students and professors seem to accept this as a routine part of Harvard life. An explanation for this widely accepted phenomenon, however, is far from obvious.
Harvard students are, for the most part, intellectually curious. Their professors are leaders in their fields and senior advisers to governments and corporations.  Why such talented students choose to surf the internet over actively listening to their distinguished professors is quite the paradox.
The question gets more perplexing when considering that outside of class, the same students are eager to meet people who are intellectual leaders in their field. The same students will desperately try to lottery into an Institute of Politics forum event with the president of Chile or a dinner discussion with Larry Summers. A recent event with the former president of India was so well attended that a police officer physically prevented me from entering the room because it was literally overflowing.
Intrigued by this paradox, I started asking my classmates “Why do you Facebook during class?” Answers were mixed, but generally a variant of the following responses. People say they go on Facebook under one of the following circumstances: A professor starts regurgitating exactly what they’ve read in the textbook; paying attention won’t clarify confusion; a professor starts on a random tangent that is neither interesting nor relevant; students need a break to re-focus; students feel pressed for time and decide to multitask.
Deeper probing of these responses has led me to the following conclusions. Harvard students are generally pragmatic and hyper-concerned about maximizing their Return On Time Investment.  During class, students will give their attention to whatever they think will give them the most utility in each moment. Past generations of students must also have wanted to maximize their ROTI during class. But technological innovation has provided today’s students with more options to do so in real time, via their smartphones and laptops.
At the same time, the IT revolution has destroyed the traditional professor-student knowledge hierarchy. Access to knowledge has become easier. In the past, professors were knowledge gatekeepers when lecturing at the pulpit. To do well in class or feed their intellectual curiosity, students had no choice but to listen actively in lecture to uncover the knowledge residing with their professors.
But today, much of knowledge has become commoditized on the web. Knowledge in any subject—semiconductor fabrication, Kantian logic, or exchange rate policy—can be accessed through a quick Google search. Online sources like Khan Academy, MIT OpenCourseWare, Wikipedia, and Google books are all freely and instantly available online. Today’s students have many choices in deciding how to educate themselves and can do so in a highly personalized and customized manner.
The Facebook phenomenon is part of a much larger knowledge and cultural paradigm shift that Harvard must proactively respond to if it wants the educational experience to remain a central part of students’ lives. Faculty need to realize that they are in constant competition for students’ time and attention and their quest for personally relevant knowledge. Professors need to start thinking of themselves as service providers who must constantly innovate to serve students better, servicing students’ curiosity and their desire to apply knowledge to create impact.
Facebook doesn’t compete for student attention equally in every class. From personal experience, classes taught by Michael Sandel, Niall Ferguson, and Donhee Ham, have a very low Facebook Index. These professors interpret knowledge and make it relevant to students in a uniquely personalized manner. Sandel makes abstract philosophy relevant to everyday life. He extracts and synthesizes student perspectives to create a classroom experience that shares knowledge in a way that can’t be found in a book. Ferguson wows classes by candidly sharing his strong opinions on world history and current events. His classes are so unique they develop into popular new books.
The demonstrated success of these professors and others like Computer Science 50’s David Malan should motivate all Harvard faculty to approach their classes with some fundamental questions. How can we add the most value to our students? Can we personalize the content to each student’s unique interests with readily available technological tools? What specialized or experiential knowledge can we provide that is unique? What knowledge and resources can we share to help our students achieve their goals?
In a world that has been impacted by knowledge flattening, Harvard clearly is not alone in struggling to capture student attention. Rather than perceiving technology as a competing force in the classroom, our creative and distinguished faculty should explore innovative teaching methods that harness the same technological force to uniquely personalize class content and deliver it in a powerful, Facebook-type manner. Doing so, will not only improve education here at Harvard but also position the University to take leadership in improving education worldwide.

Dean Michael D. Smith of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences recently announced that a “teaching and learning” initiative is likely to become a focus of Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign. The initiative, for which the University has already received a $40 million donation, will commission pedagogical innovation at Harvard, including funding pedagogical research and educational technology in the classroom. This donation and the publicity surrounding it seem to indicate that the University realizes that good teaching should be more of an institutional priority. However, we question the donation’s efficacy in the absence of a stronger culture of teaching. Technology and training alone cannot guarantee improved teaching or learning; instead, the University should foster a culture of teaching by incentivizing better pedagogy and combating the widespread belief that good teaching and good research are incompatible.
The belief that high-caliber research necessarily entails low-caliber teaching is misguided. There is no reason that we cannot simultaneously prioritize research and teaching: Indeed, the two should go hand-in-hand. Harvard attracts some of the most talented researchers, and it is precisely these researchers who, when entrenched in a culture that prizes teaching and student engagement, have the potential to become our most talented instructors. By implying a zero-sum relationship between teaching and researching, we not only shortchange the potential of our faculty members, but we also run the risk of excusing an absence of effective teaching with superior research. If we acknowledge that teaching can and should be a priority of universities, we must, then, consider how we might increase its perceived prestige.
Additionally, we encourage the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to implement other solutions to the problem of low-quality teaching. For instance, smaller class sizes and lower student-faculty ratios must become a priority. Reducing class sizes is one of the most effective measures that FAS can take to increase quality of instruction because large class sizes diminish classroom interaction and hinder the learning process itself. A possible solution to this problem might be to allow non-tenure track faculty, such as lecturers, to remain at Harvard rather than expiring their positions. As it is quite difficult to progress from a lower-rank instructor to a tenured professor, allowing talented, non-tenured teachers to remain on faculty can ensure that we have an abundance of quality instructors.
Moreover, FAS should instate a reliable course evaluation system. Without a sounder system of monitoring teaching quality, we consign ourselves to rationalizing expensive pedagogical updates on hunches and assumptions. While there are advantages to our current Q guide, it cannot serve as FAS’s principal course evaluation tool because it is entirely a product of student opinion. Student opinion is no doubt helpful in course selection, but it is also likely to reward less rigorous courses. We encourage FAS to instate a more authoritative course evaluation system, such as a comprehensive departmental evaluation of each instructor. Both departmental evaluations and retainment of quality instructors will incentivize good teaching among our faculty members.
If Harvard truly wishes to make teaching count, it must first target the values of those who have the power to make it count: our teachers. If we are to play an active role in sustaining the value of scholarly work in our culture, then we must take steps to prioritize the transmission of knowledge from the creators to the consumers of scholarship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months ago, I decided to participate in a project that would push for 100 percent cage-free eggs in Harvard dining halls. Battery cage facilities are so horrifying that surely, I thought, it would be easy to mobilize Harvard students around this issue. Had that been the case, Harvard’s switch to cage-free eggs would have come much sooner. What animals in factory farms endure, however horrifying, has not yet become a priority for enough students that it could serve as the basis for the mobilization of an entire campus. I needed to horrify people about something else.
Crimson writer Sandra Y. L. Korn recently wrote an article on why a sustainable food system is simultaneously a sustainable job system. She described why we cannot, if we are to successfully advocate for sustainability in our dining halls, separate the twin forces of environmental degradation and degradation of labor standards.
In a similar vein, a battery cage is hellish not only for the hen who spends the entirety of her life crippled and unmoving in its confines. It is also hellish for the laborer who treats her with horrifying brutality not because he is a sadistic human being who wants to, but because he is an instrument in a food system in which he has to. It is hellish for the family of the laborer, which falls victim to the psychological damage and even domestic violence that so often results from time spent in a factory farm. It is hellish for the millions of low-income Americans who live near the masses of chemical and animal waste discarded by factory farms.
In short, our current food system is detrimental to virtually every party involved because it is a system rooted in unchecked destruction and exploitation. There is no party left unharmed by our current food system: not animals, the environment, consumers, or producers. As I refined my understanding of the intersectionality of food justice, the way in which I discussed cage-free eggs changed: Cage-free eggs became just one way in which we could at last begin to reform our food system, one of the many multifarious, transitional solutions to the problem of food justice. It was when I began to discuss this multifariousness that many more people began to listen and lend their support. Finally, in response to a swelling of student advocacy, Harvard University Dining Services announced on Oct. 17 that it would switch to exclusively cage-free eggs.
Many of us tend to compartmentalize food activism by claiming just one perspective of many as our own. This  illustrates the flawed way in which we understand food justice, both in theory and in practice, and I have been just as guilty of this. Until quite recently, the food movement has been not a movement at all but a fragmented collection of interest groups that advocate for the environment, animals, labor or public health. These are all necessary and laudable victories, but ones that when treated as isolated issues evade larger questions of food justice. If we do not speak for more than one victim of our food system at a time we cannot begin to address these larger questions. The cage-free egg initiative, I hope, not only directed Harvard’s purchasing power away from an atrocious practice, but also helped promote dialogue on the intersectionality of seemingly unrelated allegiances in food justice.
A few months ago, I had the privilege of attending the Real Food Challenge’s Northeast Training. RFC is unique in that it empowers students to recognize the multifarious nature of food activism. At RFC, I saw what a true food movement will look like: It will not eschew the importance of any injustice in favor of another. Nor will it be suffocated by internal disagreement or ask members to forgo their own passions and strengths in food justice. On the contrary, it will harness the knowledge and passion of each individual to fuel a movement that is conscious of the reality of food activism: that our food system is too complex and exploitative to be reformed one injustice at a time. As I have learned through activism for cage-free eggs, there is truly no hierarchy of oppressions.

The Memorial Church plaque recognizing Harvard recipients of the Medal of Honor will be rededicated on Veteran’s Day, 11/11/11, at 11:00 a.m. to include all 17 alumni who are known to have received the highest military decoration, bestowed by the U.S. President.
When the plaque was first installed in 2009, 10 names were listed. A week before the original dedication ceremony on Nov. 11, 2009, Capt. Paul E. Mawn USNR (Ret.) ’63, who was coordinating the dedication of the plaque. received a number of calls from family members of Medal of Honor recipients requesting that their relative be included.
In the years since, Mawn—who serves as the chairman of Advocates for Harvard Reserve Officers’ Training Corps—has vetted all of the names suggested and concluded that 17 alumni have received the award.
Major General John E. Hyten ’81 of the U.S. Air Force will speak at the Nov. 11 event, and over 150 veterans are expected to attend.
Other than the service academies, Harvard alumni have received more Medal of Honor awards than any other university.
A recently published book titled “Crimson Valor” chronicles the stories of the 17 Harvard alumni who have received the distinction.
“This book will promote and promulgate the long tradition of Harvard alumni defending our national security by serving our great country in the U.S. military, which is one of the goals of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC which we define as the “‘Long Crimson Line,’” Mawn wrote in an email.
The book was authored by Capt. Philip A. Keith ’68 USN (Ret.), a former fighter pilot and a veteran of the Vietnam War.Keith pledged to donate 50 percent of the net profits from the sale of the book to offset the cost of the plaque, which was funded by alumni.
President of the University Drew G. Faust is expected to attend the Nov. 11 event, which is being coordinated by the Harvard Veterans Organization.
This event is emblematic of Harvard’s recent efforts to rectify its relationship with the military.
Until last spring, ROTC had not been recognized by the University for nearly four decades, causing some tension between Harvard and advocates for the military.
Last month, Harvard officially opened a naval ROTC office, and the University is currently in discussions with the army and air force about their potential presence on campus in the future.

The Food Law Society at Harvard Law School hosted a conference Friday on United States food policy, discussing healthy diets, federal agricultural laws, hunger, and how to encourage healthy eating. The conference highlighted the need to increase access to cheap, healthy food and to rebrand healthy food as something with mass appeal.
Most of the conference was centered on the legal and economic issues associated with food. Doug Rauch, former president of Trader Joe’s Co. who helped turn the California chain into a national success, spoke on what he called “the U.S. hunger paradox”—the idea that we have more food, more cheaply than any nation in history, but more people are going hungry.
Rauch went on to explain that on the supply side, we have so much food that people who can afford to buy can afford to waste; it’s so cheap that many people throw good food out unconcerned. On the demand side, Rauch said, those afflicted by poverty cannot afford food containing essential nutrients, leading to malnutrition, and can only afford cheap food with empty calories, leading to obesity.
Rauch is fighting empty calories by opening health food stores in poor communities whose products are cheap, but still economically sustainable for the business. “Fighting hunger isn’t about a full stomach, it’s about a healthy meal ... This is something we know how to cure, what is missing is the prospective, the policy, and the will to do it,” Rauch said.
Jennifer Pomeranz, the director of legal initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, discussed the market conditions that made unhealthy food so much more popular than healthy food.
Pomeranz criticized the restaurant industry for lobbying to keep calorie counts off of menus. That effort, she said, has worsened access to healthy food, which is less aggressively marketed, less accessible, and more expensive.
“They expect you to be responsible, but they don’t give you the info needed to be responsible,” Pomeranz said.
Freya Williams and Graceann Bennett—two executives at OgilvyEarth, a marketing company devoted to promoting sustainable products—discussed how to make sustainability more appealing to consumers.
They cited the statistical observation that environmental sustainability is either seen as “feminine” or “for rich elitist snobs and crunchy granola hippies” as hindrances to greater sustainability. The apparent femininity makes men embarrassed to engage in its practices, and the elitism and hippie mystique deters the moderate middle class.
Bennett explained that the key is for sustainable companies to engage in marketing techniques with masculine and more mainstream-America appeal. “Honestly, what guy is going to buy a little square car called a Nissan Leaf?” Williams quipped.
The conference was sponsored in name by Technology, Engineering, and Design (TED), a nonprofit focused on spreading ideas through conferences that can be viewed online for free. The HLS conference was independently organized by the Harvard Law Food Society, an organization dedicated to giving HLS students experience in food and agricultural policy from legal, managerial, and scientific perspectives.

A Harvard Business School conference over the weekend brought together a variety of clean technology industry officials, sustainable development researchers, and business school students to foster dialogue about the changing relationship between the environment and business—a conversation that led to a ringing endorsement about the importance of alternative energy.
“Clean technologies are on the road to disrupting multibillion dollar markets. We’re underestimating the impact that technology will have on the energy industry. We are in the early stages of a technology revolution that will fundamentally change energy economics,” said keynote speaker Tommy Iglesby, who is a principal at McKinsey & Company’s energy practice.
Iglesby said that there is a need to develop clean energy sources while also revitalizing existing forms of energy such as hydrocarbons. He characterized clean technology as a disruptive force that could revolutionize energy economics because it would affect every aspect of consumers’ lives, including, for example, the way people drive.
“This is dropping a rock in a very large pond and watching the ripples affect an entire industry,” he said, referring to the launch of clean technology efforts. “It isn’t about one technology over another—it’s about all of them.”
The conference, which is the largest energy-related forum at the Harvard Business School, featured over 30 speakers from small start-ups to large corporations in both conventional and alternative energy fields. Panelists included professors in urban development, clean energy entrepreneurs such as Jim Matheson of Flagship Ventures, and officials such as S. Vijay Iyer, the director of the sustainable energy department at the World Bank.
Panel topics ranged from the role of entrepreneurship in clean technology to the development of global energy policy. Each panel included a moderator and question-and-answer format for participants.
“The private sector can only go so far,” said conference participant Omar C. Mitchell, a student at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “In my personal opinion, it’s about the usage of our current resources and the way the government regulates the industry.”
Mitchell, who said that he plans to pursue a career in energy-efficient construction, said he chose to attend the conference in order to gain knowledge about the intersection between business and energy.
“I need to understand the broader context of energy,” he said.
The conference also included for the first time a start-up showcase, which highlighted over 20 budding business ventures in the clean technology industry. Co-hosted by the MIT Energy club, the showcase provided companies, such as Harvest Power, an organic materials management company, and 360Chestnut, a business that promotes energy efficiency, a chance to present their ideas to the conference participants.
The conference was hosted by the Harvard Business School’s Energy and Environment Club.

Students, faculty, and staff from Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, MIT, Northeastern, and Wellesley gathered together to volunteer for Cradles to Crayons last Friday as part of the Greater Boston Universities’ Week of Service.
Volunteers helped the non-profit—which sends clothing, school supplies, books, and other essentials to children in need—package 663 winter clothing bundles with pants, sweaters, and other winter gear necessities.
“This winter, we expect requests for 15,000 winter coats and 10,000 hats and mittens,” said Lynn Margherio, the group’s founder. “We’ve had hundreds of students across the Harvard campus come out to volunteer since the beginning of this year.”
The Week of Service falls in line with President Drew G. Faust’s initiative to engage the Harvard community in volunteering opportunities and to promote public service.
Carolyn W. Chou ’13, a Phillips Brooks House Association volunteer at Cradles to Crayons on Friday, said that the University approached PBHA to participate.
“It’s important to encourage initiatives through the university to do public service, as well as to hear what other non-Harvard students are doing to figure out how we can all work together to provide the quality services we want to for youth and families,” she said. “Cradles to Crayons is an ideal organization to work with because it provides not only social and emotional support to kids, but also tangible resources such as clothing and school supplies.”
The Week of Service was the first coordinated volunteer week across all six university campuses.
“The six presidents had dinner and came together to talk about students sharing community service experiences cross-campus,” said Maile Takahashi, director of community programing at the Harvard Public Affairs and Communication Office. From that discussion evolved the coordinated service week between Cradles to Cradles and the universities.
“Cradles to Crayons has been a terrific organizer and a great example of social entrepreneurship,” Takahashi added. “I’m hoping that people take away from the volunteering experience that everyone can make a very real and tangible impact to better our community.”

Exposure during pregnancy to Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical commonly found in plastics and consumer goods, is linked to behavioral and emotional problems in young girls, according to a recent study conducted, in part, by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Researchers, who collected data from the urine samples of 244 Cincinnati-based female participants and their children, found that  the mothers’ in utero exposure to BPA was associated with behavioral problems at 3 years of age for girls, but not for boys. Increasing levels of gestational BPA exposure were associated with hyperactive, aggressive, and anxious behavior in young girls, who also experienced poorer control of their emotions, according to lead author Joseph M. Braun, a research fellow at the Department of Environment Health at HSPH.
“It may be that BPA may actually be able to interfere with brain development in girls by some sort of sex-specific mechanism, but cannot interfere with boys’ development,” Braun said.
Braun said that a possible explanation for this link may be because BPA acts like estrogen.
“We know that sex steroids, such as estrogen and testosterone, are important for brain development,” Braun said. “We suspect that fluctuations in these hormones during pregnancy might impact the risk for behavioral disorders like ADHD or anxiety.”
Braun added that BPA can act on other systems of the brain, including the dopamine system, which is also linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anxiety, as well as depression.
Over 95 percent of each an individual’s exposure comes through eating food that has come in contact with BPA, Braun said.
BPA is found in many consumer products, including canned food linings, polycarbonate plastics, and some thermal paper receipts found at ATMs or in grocery stores.
“We found previously that women who work as cashiers have higher BPA concentrations than other women,” Braun said.
Researchers suggested that anyone concerned can reduce their BPA exposure by avoiding canned and packaged foods, thermal paper sales receipts, and polycarbonate containers marked with the number 7 recycling symbol.
The study’s results were published today in an advance online edition of Pediatrics, a research journal.
Scientists are now looking at children of age 8 to 9 to study the relationships between depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression in relation to the BPA exposure both in utero and throughout childhood.

Fans of crew and curious visitors convened Saturday and Sunday at the 47th Head of the Charles Regatta for an afternoon full of intense races and energetic vendors handing out free samples of their products.
Spectators came from far and wide to watch their favorite teams compete in a variety of rowing events.
Harvard’s men’s and women’s crew teams ultimately brought in the most points of any school, club, or university. The men’s heavyweight crew team won first place, after coming in second in the regatta last year.
Some onlookers had friends that they wanted to be able to support and cheer on in person.
Aaron Kano-Bower, a student from Wesleyan University, said that he had been coming to the regatta for the past three years, ever since his friends began to compete in the races.
“I came back for fall break just to see the Head of the Charles and to hang out in the city,” said Kano-Bower.
While some passed the afternoon taking photos of the swift athletes or sitting leisurely on the bank of the river, others came to enjoy the free merchandise that many vendors were offering to passerby en masse.
“I got a lot of free granola bars,” said KJ J. Stime ’15.
Booths stretched along the Charles River, largely centered around the Weld Boathouse on Memorial Drive. Vendors drew in potential customers with unique games and a variety of giveaways. Gogobot, a community site for sharing travel advice and recommendations, invited guests to spin a wheel that would guarantee them one of many prizes like a small bag or a hat, especially useful for the chilly weather.
“People are just descending upon us in hoards,” said Julia Pond, a representative for the company.
Other popular brand names were there as well. 5-hour Energy had a big presence with a giant blow-up bottle of the drink that could be seen clearly above the dense crowd. Representatives were handing out multiple bottles of their product to anyone interested.
Local companies were also present in full force, with Palumbo Kettle Corn generating crowds with free samples of their freshly made popcorn.
“We have been doing this event for eight years,” said Steve Palumbo, the owner of the company. He said that the free samples are attractive “because many don’t really know what kettle corn is.”
Palumbo said that he didn’t have much time to focus on the races due to his stand being “so busy.”
However, among all the excitement, some were disappointed with the race itself. Gabe Frankel, a student visiting from Wesleyan University, said that he “expected it to be a sprint” where all the competitors would “line up in a row” to race. Once he found out that the rowers would compete for the best time and begin sequentially, he said he lost interest.
Frankel wasn’t satisfied with the free offerings either, saying that besides the 5-hour Energy samples, he hadn’t found much.
“It could’ve been better,” he said.
As the festivities came to a close on Sunday evening, visitors began to collect their belongings and depart from the river. Many were optimistic for next year’s regatta. When asked whether he would be back for next year’s event, Kano-Bower responded, ”Yep, definitely.”

The Office of Career Services on Friday held its Advertising, Marketing, and Public Relations Expo, where attendees said they appreciated the new focus on alternative careers and the diverse lineup of employers present.
“We’re definitely seeing this as a growth area for students at Harvard, particularly with the analytic and creative approach,” OCS Director Robin Mount said.
Fair attendee Norman Zhu ’13 said that while finance and consulting are popular career choices for many Harvard students, he was pleased to find opportunities to connect with other types of employers. He added that advertising and marketing are generally less popular at Harvard.
Xing Lin ’13 attended the fair with the hope of finding an internship that would give him some marketing experience.
“Some of the companies they have here are really great,” he said. Lin noted that he was particularly impressed that there were representatives from Pandora Media at the fair.
“We’ve been trying to do smaller events, more targeted events,” Mount said of the event, which took place at the OCS building at 54 Dunster St. “When it’s in a smaller space, it’s friendlier. Students are more relaxed and you can get more face time.”
Ryan C. Cutter ’13 noted that the job fair was the first OCS event he had attended.
“It’s nice to be able to walk around and talk to companies,” Cutter said, adding that he was also pleased by range of companies represented at the fair, including Jack Morton Worldwide—an experiential marketing agency.
Employer representatives said that they had been impressed by the students who they had met at the fair.
“It has been great to talk to a bunch of interested, motivated people,” said David C. Lipson, who was representing PR agency Schwartz MSL. “It’s great to know that everybody coming in the door is interested in the industry.”
Anjuli C. Felix, representing Pandora Media, echoed Lipson’s sentiments, saying that she enjoyed meeting students.
“Everyone is bright, well-spoken, and excited to talk,” Felix said.
Alice Bertholin Rice, representing Ogilvy & Mather, said that the advertising, marketing, and public relations agency is looking for juniors for their summer internship program and seniors for their Associates program.
“We’re looking for students that are creative but have a business acumen,” she said. “We don’t require a specific major—we’re looking for diversity of thought.”
Pandora Head of Staffing Kevin R. Kinkor said that he had met several students who had particularly impressed him.
“I just can’t wait to go back to the office and tell the hiring manager,” he said.

Harvard University Students Taking On Poverty (STOP) hosted a joint lecture entitled “Bridging the Gap” at the Science Center on Saturday, featuring 11 guest speakers who shared their views on pressing poverty-related subjects.
“Our goal is informing the public about issues in poverty that they might be blind to,” said Marjorie LaCombe ’13, president of STOP. Each speaker had approximately 10 minutes to present, with the ultimate goal of giving attendees a well-rounded view of some critical aspects of poverty all over the world.
The subject material and style of presentation was extremely diverse: professors, journalists, and poets all had something to contribute. The first speaker was Harvard Professor of Philosophy and Human Rights Mathias Risse, who discussed the inherent injustices in the free market that he said help perpetuate poverty. He argued that helping to alleviate poverty was more a matter of correcting systemic inequality than relying on individual charity.
“Helping the poor is a matter of justice, not a matter of beneficence,” said Risse.
Next up was Rema Nagarajan, a journalist for The Times of India, the widest-read English newspaper in India. Nagarajan delivered a forceful speech, arguing that despite India’s rapidly rising GDP, the majority of Indian citizens were being left behind.
“Sixty percent of people earn about two dollars a day,” she said.
Anna Griffin, a reporter at The Oregonian, told the audience about Portland’s successes combatting poverty through urban planning.
Shining a more aesthetic light on the darkness of poverty, Harvard undergraduates Samantha A. Berstler ’14, and Ekene I. Obi-Okoye ’12 recited their own original poetry on the issue.
Amanda Fernandez, who represented Teach for America, also spoke at the event, advocating the importance of education in combating poverty.
From a more vocational point of view, Yvette Castro talked about Fashion Fights Poverty, a group that looks to help the poor through artisanal training and socially conscious consumerism.
Rounding out the evening were Elizabeth Toulan, senior attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services, and Katharin Dyer, a board member of CARE USA, who talked about how poverty can be combated via legal representation and humanitarian support, respectively.
The final presentation was given by 13-year-old Tajonna, whose last name was omitted from the program, and her chaperone, Samantha Wolfe, representing the Massachusetts Face of Homelessness Speakers’ Bureau. Tajonna told the story of her time living on the streets.
Themes such as education, economic support, and humanitarianism pervaded the night.  But many of the speakers made special reference to Harvard, and the significant changes that students at the College can affect with regards to poverty.
Despite the array of accomplished speakers at the event, it attracted about 50 people, leaving many of the seats in the Science Center empty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fahim Zaman ’12, like all undergraduates on the meal plan, has unlimited access to dining halls. But most meals, he struggles to find something to eat.
Zaman, a Muslim undergraduate, keeps halal, which means he only eats foods that are permissible according to Islamic law.
The restrictions include not eating pork or pork byproducts, any food prepared with alcohol, or meat from animals not slaughtered in God’s name—these items are haram, or not permissible.
“Sometimes I force myself to eat vegetarian during the week,” he says of his dining hall experience. But most days, rather than be forced into a quasi-vegetarian lifestyle, Zaman eats out in the Square.
Although Harvard University Dining Services has taken some steps to accommodate Muslims in dining halls, some students say the University could do more.
“The Muslim community is growing. There are many more Muslim students than there were a decade ago, or even five years ago,” says Abdelnasser Rashid ’12, a former president of the Harvard Islamic Society. “That’s something that [Harvard University Dining Services] and HIS should be talking about.”
QUESTIONS OF QUALITY
Harvard currently provides a weekly halal dinner for undergraduates in Winthrop on Mondays and a community dinner in Adams on Thursdays.
But Muhammad Hassaan Yousuf ’12 says that the quality of food during the Monday dinner tables has seen better days.
“I’ve seen members of HIS go and they would be unable to eat the meat,” he says. “Sometimes, it would even be raw inside.”
Rashid agrees that there are problems with the quality of the meals.
“The meat, to put it frankly, is often not well prepared. It’s so bad, in fact, sometimes, that it wouldn’t make sense for them to offer it to everyone else,” Rashid says, adding that the food during the Thursday meals in Adams—more popular among Muslim students—is better.
FEW OPTIONS
At home, Rayhnuma Ahmed ’14’s Bangladeshi family prepares halal lunches of chicken and beef.
But during the school year, Ahmed is forced to rely on sandwiches, yogurt, and salads.
In an effort to provide meat options to students like Ahmed, Harvard began supplying halal hotdogs and burgers for the grills in 2002. But Muslim students say the grill options are not filling the void left by meatless lunches.
Ahmed orders from the grill once or twice a week at the most. “It wouldn’t be healthy to eat a halal hamburger or hotdog every day,” she says, noting that grilled chicken would be a healthier option.
Rashid says the halal grill options are a good start in Harvard’s efforts to accommodate students who keep halal.
In order to provide halal food that meets religious standards, Harvard dining services must ensure that the halal meat does not come into contact with other meat, according to Rashid. This requires staff to be particularly cautious in their preparations, switching gloves between dealing with halal and non-halal meat and sectioning off part of the grill, he says.
“I came today and I looked at the grill to see if there was an area that was a bit cleaner, and there wasn’t,” says Rashid, who chose not to order meat that day.
Yousuf says that he has also had negative experiences at the grill.
He says some employees did not recognize the significance of his halal dining restrictions. A meeting with the Leverett Dining Hall manager, he says, resulted in a refresher workshop for the staff on halal cooking.
“If you ask the dining hall staff, they are very helpful,” Yousuf says. “They’ll be very careful and change their gloves.”
‘YOU HAVE HILLEL’
Last year, Yousuf—who was then director of development for HIS—says he asked HUDS for a list of all dishes involving pork and pork byproducts.
“They said it’s very hard to have a list because the ingredients keep changing,” he says. He says he contacted them repeatedly for the list, but did not hear back.
Instead, Yousuf asked HUDS to consider identifying halal foods on the name cards, next to the vegan and vegetarian signifiers. That request was also turned down because, Yousuf was told, it would open the door to listing ingredients relevant to any and all eating habits, including any allergies and other religious preferences.
Students have been left to their own devices to identify halal food—literally. Rashid developed an app in CS50 to determine which foods were safe for Muslims to eat.
Crista Martin, a spokeswoman for HUDS, says that the University is in the process of making it easier to access halal meals.
“In the near future we hope to implement a web-based menu search tool that will be useful to Muslim students in identifying any food cooked with alcohol,” she said in a statement. Martin also pointed to the grill options, the two weekly meals, and kosher dining—which meets halal requirements if it is not prepared in alcohol. All dining halls are equipped with a kosher fridge and all students have access to the Hillel dining hall.
But students are wary of relying on existing options like Hillel.
“I got the sense that they were trying to say, ‘Why do you need this, you have Hillel,’ and to me, that was kind of inappropriate,” Zaman said, pointing to the range of interactions with HUDS.
Muslims should also not have to feel dependent on another religious group for food, he said.
“We’ve all eaten [at Hillel] before, but it’s not a habit to get into. It’s a space where we’re welcome to, but it’s a space that’s not ours.”
‘A HUGE ADVENTURE’
On Thursday evenings, Adams Dining Hall Chef Ed B. Childs breezes through the Adams Small Dining Room with trays of rich halal food for the roughly 70 people who will flow through during the two-hour dinner.
Thursdays are a highlight of his week.
“I look forward to Thursdays,” he says. “We choose the menu. Each meal is a huge adventure.”
Childs delves beyond the normal dining hall recipes, exercising his culinary skill for the attendees of the Harvard Islamic Society’s Thursday Dinner Tables.
“It’s El Salvador night tonight, it’s Indian night sometimes,” Childs says, recounting the different types of halal cuisines he serves. “It’s a great atmosphere that really bonds this group.” Sometimes the recipes are from his travels, and sometimes the students request halal versions of classic American foods like the Philly Cheesesteak.
The dining hall staff often contribute recipes from their home countries, such as the El Salvadorian rice and beans dish.
The Adams House dinners, unlike the ones at Winthrop, are also open to the Harvard Muslim community at large. Rachid Chakri, a Moroccan immigrant and Extension School student who works at Harvard University Health Services, has been attending the meals for several years.
“[Childs] told me about it since he knew that I am a Muslim,” he says. “I like the food. I like making friends, because this is a chance for the Harvard Muslim Community to know each other. We are all Muslim, but there are differences.”
“I’ve never seen anyone more appreciative of dinner than this group,” Childs says.
At Winthrop’s Monday dinners, lagging attendance leaves some students worried that they will be cut entirely.
But they say that halal food should be available regardless of numbers.
“Who eats or needs halal food, I don’t think you can put a number on that. It all fluctuates. I know people who’ve changed since they’ve come here,” Zaman says. “Why can’t they present it as food for everyone in the dining hall?”
Another concern is missing out on community-building aspects of the Harvard experience. At the 375th anniversary dinner, for instance, many Muslim students were unable to eat the meat entrees. The vegetarian entrée, Welsh Rarebit, was prepared with beer, also placing it into the category of haram. Students like Ahmed, the sophomore, were left eating salads.
“I think there’s a negativity complex where you think it’s okay that you don’t have any food to eat tonight, but in reality there’s $50,000 being spent on you every year,” says Zaman. Although he appreciates the efforts Harvard has made, dining is still frustrating. “I don’t pay for only Mondays and Thursdays,” he says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hoping to seize on the energy surrounding Occupy Boston, members of the Institute of Politics visited Dewey Square on Saturday as part of a voter registration effort to encourage civic participation both at Harvard and beyond.
“We thought it would be cool to go down to Occupy Boston to talk to people to see if they would be interested in getting involved in the political process,” said Amanda E. McGowan ’13, who chairs the IOP’s National Campaign program, which focuses on increasing voter registration on campus.
About 15 volunteers went to the Dewey Square camp in two shifts, one in the morning and one later in the evening.
According to McGowan, members of the IOP were surprised to find that many occupiers were not interested in voting, particularly during the IOP’s morning visit.
“Some were already registered but did not want to vote. Others were not registered and did not want to be involved in the political system,” McGowan said.
“There was a sense of disappointment with the system,” she continued.
The IOP’s interest in registering voters began a few weeks ago, when former Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell—an IOP visiting fellow—inquired about the percent of occupiers who were registered to vote.
“One of the things [Rendell] said was that he could sympathize with the movement, but that he wasn’t sure it had any political goals,” McGowan said. “He said, ‘I wonder how many people there are registered to vote?’ and it made us all stop and look around.”
IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12 stressed the importance of getting youth politically involved.
“Obviously a component of what the IOP does is getting people involved in government and making social change,” Solnet said. “I think these are all things that are tied into the IOP’s mission.”
Solnet said he sees the moment as an opportunity to motivate young people to become civically engaged.
“[The Occupy movement] is historic, and it’s something that’s growing quickly around the world,” Solnet said. “For many people this is a very inspiring movement.”
Indeed, while some protesters expressed a lack of interest in becoming involved with the political process, many others were receptive to the call for affecting social change at the ballot box.
“The people there in the evenings tended to be a lot more politically involved,” McGowan said.
IOP members also organized a small Harvard contingent to attend a Sunday ‘teach-in’ in Dewey Square about creating successful social movements, led by Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Marshall L. Ganz ’64-’92.
Matthew R. Shuham ’15, a member of the IOP’s Special Events Board, expressed enthusiasm about the trip to Dewey Square.
“We are seeing this political event shaping in our own backyard,” Shuham said.
He continued, “The IOP can sometimes be a theoretical place to work and learn. When we see something like this happening, people get excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an unprecedented open forum Sunday night hosted by the Undergraduate Council, three top University administrators offered few concrete answers to student concerns about social spaces and other student life issues.
The meeting marked the first time that University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith were all present at a UC meeting.
Discussion at the meeting was centered around two main issues—the creation of a student center and secondary fields—before the floor was opened for general questions for the final fifteen minutes.
Students present at the meeting expressed disappointment with the administrators’ responses to concerns regarding the creation of a student center.
During an interview with Charlie Gibson in Sanders Theatre in September of last year, Faust entertained the idea of transforming the lower floors of the Holyoke Center into a student center. But in her opening statement on the issue last night, Faust denied having publicly addressed the creation of a student center.
“I’ve actually never talked about a student center,” Faust said. “I’ve talked ever since I became President about what I’ve called ‘common spaces.’”
In responding to student concerns, Hammonds and Faust both repeatedly referenced the work carried out by the Committee on Common Spaces that recommended that the University make better use of available space in the Yard and in the Holyoke Center. Faust has acted on the committee’s recommendations to make better use of the Yard, installing the brightly colored chairs that have become a hallmark of the Yard during her administration. But besides the off-handed comment to Gibson, Faust has remained mum on plans for the Holyoke Center, and on Sunday both Faust and Hammonds were more inclined to embrace the committee’s recommendations in spirit rather than offer concrete plans on how to solve the problem of insufficient social space at Harvard.
Students remained persistent in their engagement on the issue at Sunday’s meeting, responding that social spaces on campus are too disjointed and expressing hopes for a single, centralized location for students to come together and socialize. Faust, however, shared a different vision.
“I want to contrast a ‘student center’ with what you might call a ‘campus center,’” she said. “There is a need for social spaces across the University, not just the College.”
“And my goal is to provide a context in which the entire University can come together more broadly,” Faust added later in a reference to the work of the Committee on Common Spaces.
Students said they were frustrated that Faust and her lieutenants declined to offer specific plans to build a student center.
“I was disappointed to find out that the leaders of the College do not even have a definitive plan moving forward for a student center,” said Spenser R. Goodman ’14, a UC representative for Cabot House. “The best they could do was deflect questions or just give vague, ambiguous answers and say that they were trying.”
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14, one of the students in attendance, shared similar frustrations.
“I came to this meeting because I realized that three important members of the administration were going to give what was hopefully an uncensored view,” he said. “But I am not sure I gained a sense of what will be changed, and the impression I got was that they are not sure what they are doing.”
With about 100 individuals attending the meeting, the audience represented a wide range of constituencies—including students, House Masters, faculty, staff, and directors of various centers on campus.
“So many people came with thoughtful questions and it just really goes to show that students and other campus members have a lot on their mind,” said UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12. “I think the meeting went really well, but in order to focus the discussion in the future, we will need to explore other avenues as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three top Harvard administrators struck discordant tones Sunday night while reflecting on the controversial freshman values pledge during an Undergraduate Council forum.
All three—the University President, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the Dean of the College—celebrated the dialogue that followed the College’s decision to institute a values pledge accompanied by publicly displayed signatures.
During Sunday’s meeting, University President Drew G. Faust supported the College actively encouraging conversations on Harvard’s values—a position echoed by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. But FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, bristling a little at the question, spoke more cautiously about the value the pledge brings to the Harvard community.
“The pledge itself is not going to work very well except as a vehicle to have these conversations,” Smith said.
Without criticizing the pledge, Faust spoke positively about the “vibrant discussion” of values that resulted from the controversy.
“The reason we have a residential house system is because an education at Harvard is about your whole lives,” Faust said. “Whatever form it takes, the kind of conversation that has gone on about values this fall has been very important.”
The discussion of the pledge came during the open question and answer session of the meeting in response to a UC representative’s request for the administrators to give their opinion on the incident.
The pledge, which the Freshman Dean’s Office inaugurated this fall, provided each freshmen entryway with a statement asking students to commit to “upholding the values of the College and to making the entryway and Yard a place where all can thrive and where the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.” Proctors asked students to sign the pledge during the annual Convocation Ceremony, and the signed document was to be displayed in freshman entryways.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 denounced the pledge on his blog and called it “very unlike Harvard” during an interview with The Crimson.
Lewis expressed concerns that the public signing and public display of names on the pledge placed unfair pressure on students to add their name to a document that they otherwise might not sign.
The College later reversed its decision to include the signatures with the text. The content of the pledge, without signatures, is currently on display in all freshman entryways.
College administrators have said that they plan to pursue some statement of the College’s values in future years, although whether that will take the form of a values pledge has yet to be determined.
“The kind of conversations we’ve had this fall have been really important and really good,” Hammonds said during Sunday’s forum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In search of effective strategies for advocating immigration reform, nearly 50 students attended the Ivy League Immigrants’ Rights Coalition Summit over the weekend, hosted by Harvard College Act on a Dream.
Joining a contingent of 20 Harvard students, 26 attendees traveled to Cambridge for the summit. Every school in the Ivy League was represented, as well as Georgetown University and New York University.
The summit brought together students passionate about immigration reform and focused heavily on the Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. If passed, the bill would grant conditional permanent residency to undocumented students who were brought to the United States before the age of 16, under the condition that they graduate high school and complete either two years of higher level education or two years of military service.
The first pan-Ivy summit on immigration reform, the conference reflects growing advocacy efforts regarding the DREAM Act at several colleges and universities across the country. The DREAM Act was first introduced to Congress in 2001 and was most recently reintroduced in May, but has not been successfully passed into law.
“Our hope is to form a more formal coalition among all the Ivy League schools that already do DREAM Act advocacy independently,” said Nicolas E. Jofre ’13, one of the main summit organizers and co-director of Harvard College Act on a Dream. “This was the first time this has ever been attempted, and the fact that we had representation from every school was a huge deal.”
Organizers said they were surprised to find that student groups at other colleges and universities have also been active in advocacy efforts.
“A lot of the students who showed up were very passionate, and we discovered that there’s a lot more activism going on than we originally anticipated,” said Melissa V. Perez ’13, co-director of Harvard College Act on a Dream.
Many participants were drawn to immigration reform advocacy due to their personal ties with affected communities.
“The issue of immigration is something that has been very personal to me. I come from a community that is highly Latino in terms of demographics,” Perez said. “I have a lot of family members and close friends who are directly impacted. I have a stake in it in that sense.”
The conference featured Pulitzer Prize winner Jose A. Vargas, a journalist who has written for the Washington Post and the New Yorker, among other publications. Earlier this year, Vargas revealed publicly that he is undocumented, and he has since been active in immigration reform advocacy. During the panel, he stressed the importance of reaching out to those who do not support paths toward legalization for undocumented residents.
“I felt like we had a lot of conversations that aren’t generally addressed in DREAM activism,” Perez said. “Jose A. Vargas talked about how activism often preaches to the choir—that’s a conversation that isn’t often had.”
While participants felt the conference was a success, organizers said this is only the first step in accomplishing Act on a Dream’s broader goals.
“We realize there’s a lot of work that still needs to be accomplished,” Perez said. “But we all have resources in the Ivy League that are huge privileges [that we can use] for that purpose.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After having its lead cut to a lone goal in the final moments of its game Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team found itself forced to fend off an eager Princeton team looking for the equalizer. Withstanding the offensive onslaught, the Crimson dominated possession over the final two minutes to capture the 2-1 win.
“When you face Princeton, you know you’re going to do a lot of chasing and defending,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They kick the ball so well. It was an exhausting game, and Princeton played really well and really stressed our defense incredibly well, and I’m glad we absorbed that.”
Harvard (10-4-1, 4-0-1 Ivy) hosted the Tigers (5-9-1, 1-4-0) under the lights at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium on Saturday evening. The Crimson entered the match looking to extend its slim lead over the University of Pennsylvania (12-2-0, 4-1-0) in the Ivy League standings.
Harvard and Princeton opened the match with a long stretch of back-and-forth play, as each team looked for scoring chances.
The first shot opportunity came on a through ball to co-captain Melanie Baskind with 30 minutes to go in the first half, when she fired just wide of the left post from six yards out.
Just minutes later, the Tigers almost found the net off of a bending corner kick. Hooking into the box, the ball came loose, and a scramble ensued. Before any Princeton strikers could get a foot on the ball, Harvard goalkeeper Bethany Kanten secured the ball as she left her line.
The Tigers maintained pressure with a second corner kick moments later, but Kanten thwarted a header with a diving save, keeping the game scoreless with 20 minutes to go in the half.
The Crimson provided a successful response off of a throw-in with 17 minutes remaining in the half. After several attempted clears by the Tiger defense, Harvard freshman Mai Le chested the ball and volleyed a blistering lefty shot just inches inside the right post to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
Knowing the danger of Princeton’s relentless offense, the Crimson looked to maintain its composure following the goal.
“We had to get our focus back, concentrate on keeping up our intensity, and keep playing the game,” Le said.
Harvard did just that, as it found itself with another scoring chance with 12 minutes to go in the half. On a through ball out of the midfield, Baskind outran the Princeton defense and sent a shot just outside the frame.
Just prior to the halftime break, the Crimson faced a scare, as the Tigers received a direct kick just outside the 18-yard box. The penalty chance amounted to nothing, as the Harvard defense cleared the shot before it even approached the goal.
The Crimson addressed both its offensive and defensive needs at the half.
“We talked about converting on the chances we were getting on the flanks ... and making dangerous runs in the box,” Baskind said. “Our defense was playing well, and we just needed to keep winning balls out of the air.”
After the second half rolled around, the Tigers began to dominate possession.
Within the first three minutes, Princeton found itself with multiple scoring chances. A minute into the half, the Tigers sent a cross in front of the goal about eight yards out, which the Harvard defense managed to clear.
Moments later, off of a cross from the right flank, Princeton midfielder Melissa Downey put her foot on an open volley in front of the net, but the shot skipped just over the crossbar. After making several more runs, Downey again put pressure on the Harvard defense with a shot that sailed wide with 35 minutes to go in the half.
The Tiger barrage continued throughout the half. On a dangerous Princeton attack, Kanten came through for the home team, sending a header from striker Jen Hoy over the bar with 33 minutes remaining in the game. Harvard needed to look for ways to slow the Tiger offense.
“We needed to step up our pressure,” Le said. “We needed to try to put them under a bit more.”
With 30:47 to go in the half, Harvard did just that. On a long ball from the defense, Crimson rookie Meg Casscells-Hamby beat her defender and laid the ball across to Baskind from the left for an easy finish, giving Harvard a 2-0 lead.
“What a great choice from Meg,” Leone said. “Someone was in a better position, she delivered the ball perfectly, and it was a great finish.”
Leone wasn’t the only one who appreciated Casscells-Hamby’s assist.
“The cross was textbook—I didn’t have to do anything. If I could switch it in the book, I would,” Baskind said. “That’s her goal.”
Princeton’s pressure continued for the duration of the game, picking up in the last two minutes following a point-blank goal from Hoy assisted by defender Gabrielle Ragazzo.
With only one goal separating the teams, Princeton ramped up its already aggressive play.
“At that point, we were just focused on how we were going to close out the game,” Baskind said.
But Harvard ultimately managed to withstand the Tigers’ final push in the longest two minutes of the game.
The final horn couldn’t have come any sooner for Leone.
“Bend, don’t break, and that’s basically what we did,” Leone said. “We bent like crazy, but we didn’t break ... We just held on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League is proving to be a conference full of very evenly-matched teams.
Against Princeton on Saturday at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, it took the Crimson’s best effort for it to walk away with a victory against a team that already had three league losses on the season.
But the Tigers played beyond their league standing, performing as if everything was on the line, defending very well and physically letting Harvard know that they would not go down easy. Princeton committed 12 fouls, and three of its players received yellow cards on the match.
Harvard responded with nine fouls of its own—its second-highest total in league play this season—but, as has been the norm this season, received no cautions from the referee.
“I didn’t like that we gave up so many fouls, especially in the second half,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “If you’re moving your feet, you’re not fouling that much, and I thought we struggled a little bit [with that].”
But Harvard refused to let the rough play affect its overall game plan.
WITHSTANDING THE BARRAGE
The home team instead let its goal-scoring do the talking, converting two of its five chances on goal while the visitors could only put away one of four. The Tigers out-shot Harvard, 15-7.
It was the second straight week in Ivy play that the Crimson had fewer attempts than the team it hosted. While Harvard built a one-goal cushion in the first half thanks to its good control of possession, it was Princeton who went into halftime with a 7-4 shot advantage.
“It felt good being up 1-0, but obviously, they’re a great team,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “We just talked [during halftime] about converting on the chances we were getting on the flanks, but we were having some trouble getting the ball back and making dangerous runs in the box.”
The Tigers came out of the break with clear intentions of finding the equalizer. They not only upped the offensive pressure but also dominated overall possession, keeping the host in its own half for much of the second period. It was only on a counter-attack that Harvard built a 2-0 advantage, and after the score, the Crimson retreated back to its defensive stance.
The visitors were doing many things right but lacked the scoring touch they had demonstrated over the past four games. During that stretch, Princeton scored 16 goals—three of by striker Jen Hoy, who had the Tigers’ lone tally of Saturday’s game. The rest of the Princeton attack was off-target, sending the ball wide of the net on chances that could have been put away.
Luckily for the home team, accuracy was not an issue for rookie Mai Le, whose volley from the edge of the 18-yard box flew near the right post and evaded the leaping dive of Tiger goalkeeper Kristin Watson. After 28 minutes of Crimson-dominated possession, the goal was well-deserved.
Though Harvard’s two-goal lead was cut in half in the final minutes of the game, the Crimson knew that it had to control possession to run out the clock. That’s exactly what it did, frustrating Princeton to no end.
“Props to them for not giving up,” Baskind said. “They had a ton of opportunities, so for them to finish one, I don’t think it was too surprising. But at that point, we were just focused on how we were going to close out this game.”
LEADING THE PACK
After finishing second on the team last season with 22 points, a lot of expectations were set on co-captain Melanie Baskind, one of the few veterans left in the Crimson attack.
The game against Princeton once again showed why the senior is so important to the success of the team.
To start the second half, Leone rested the starter, who had run around Princeton’s defense for most of the first half, highlighted by a neat move near the net that left a defender stumbling behind.
The Tigers took advantage of the Crimson’s key playmaker’s absence, keeping freshman goalkeeper Bethany Kanten busy with shot after shot.
But the second goal came once Baskind was inserted back into the lineup over 10 minutes into the period.
A quality outlet pass to rookie Meg Casscells-Hamby freed the midfielder forward and instead of taking the shot, Casscells-Hamby selflessly passed it off to a sprinting Baskind for the easy score. The two speedsters were too much for the Princeton defense to handle.
With two games left in the campaign, the senior has a good chance of adding to her current 21 points—which lead the Ivy League—and exceeding last year’s total. With most of the plays involving her feet, Baskind will definitely have a say in the season’s final outcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most people who came to Harvard Stadium on Saturday probably expected just what I did: an old-fashioned whooping, courtesy of the mighty Harvard offense and defense.
At the very least, there were some guarantees. Against a weak Princeton defense, junior Colton Chapple would have another day that left his stat sheets looking like a Madden box score. And the stingy Harvard defensive line would shut down the Tigers’ running game.
But on Saturday, you couldn’t count on anything. The unexpected became the expected in one of the craziest games that Soldiers Field has hosted in years.
The most surprising moment, though, didn’t come when the teams scored nine touchdowns on 12 possessions. Or even when Princeton fought back from a 26-point deficit to bring the game within three points.
No, it came just one minute and 22 seconds into the game, when a Harvard No. 16 jersey—worn by senior quarterback Collier Winters—came onto the field to lead the offense.
I thought—we all thought—this was a done deal. Winters was out. Through. It was Chapple’s game now. Winters had ridden off into the sunset. Forced into early retirement, the next stop for Winters was Florida. Bingo and golf, here we come!
Because during Winters’ injury, Chapple had stepped in and set the record books ablaze, doing things with the football that Harvard quarterbacks just don’t do.
And even with Winters healthy to play last week, it was the junior that came out to marshal the offense, not the veteran Winters.
So no one expected that Chapple would’ve been benched in favor of the fifth-year senior. Even the stadium announcer had it wrong, proclaiming that Chapple would start behind center against the Tigers before the game.
In the junior’s place, Winters didn’t have a flawless game. He missed the open receiver at times and opted scramble far too often. He had an ugly interception in the second quarter.
But overall, Winters picked up just where Chapple had left off, completing 81 percent of his passes, throwing for 403 yards, and tallying six touchdowns—five through the air, and one on the ground.
And so, Winters too assured himself a place in the Harvard record books, becoming just the third Crimson gunslinger ever to throw for more than 400 yards in a game.
Some of Winters’ passes were, well, Chapple-esque. Throws like his 53-yard touchdown pass to senior Chris Lorditch couldn’t have been placed any better.
And certainly, it helped to have such a deep and talented wide receiver corps. Some receptions just wouldn’t have been possible without acrobatic moves from the wideouts. Sophomore receiver Matt Brown’s high-flying touchdown reception in the first quarter proved that sometimes it pays to have basketball players on the gridiron.
In the end, though, it was Winters’ game. And now, it’s Winters’ offense, as he appears to be the long-term starter.
“I’m really proud of what Colton did while I was out,” Winters said. “I’m thankful for the coaches having the confidence in me to play me this week, but I’m really grateful for Colton getting us in this position, and I thought he did a great job.”
In his own, soft-spoken way, Winters was thanking Colton for the ride. But now, he’ll take the keys back, thank you very much.
On the other side of the football, the defense, the one constant all year has been the powerful, suffocating defensive line. Senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz and Co. had held opponents to an average of just 55.4 yards per game on the ground coming into Saturday’s game.
But against Princeton, when upside down became right-side up, the run defense took the day off.
Other than one sack by Ortiz, who was pulled early in the second half after suffering a mild concussion, the usually dominant D-line got dominated. The leave-your-mouth-wide-open front seven did just that against the Tigers, but for a much different reason.
In its first five games, the Crimson D-line had allowed 277 yards on the ground.
In 60 minutes, Princeton nearly matched that number, galloping for 267 yards.
And the on-and-off secondary was off as well, surrendering nearly 300 yards in the air. The trouble really began when senior cornerback Matt Hanson had to sit out a few series after getting banged up. Without its stalwart, the secondary struggled, dropping coverages and failing to stop the relentless Princeton attack.
Eventually, after the all-Ivy senior came back in, the defensive troubles subsided, and Harvard overcame the adversity to take a far more exciting game than was previously expected.
But Murphy refused to explain away the defensive struggles by pointing to injuries to key players. And rightly so. He knows there’s serious work to be done before the level of competition picks up.
“I don’t care who goes out of a game,” Murphy said. “If Josue goes down, we have to step up. We talk about it all the time: everything we do is about adversity training ... The true test of fortitude and the true test of excellence is being able to fight through adversity. So there’s no excuses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The forward pass has been around in college football for about 105 years now. In a little over a century, only one Harvard quarterback had ever thrown for five touchdowns in a game—as of two weeks ago, that is.
In the two weeks since, it’s happened twice.
No Crimson quarterback had five passing touchdowns in the same game since the early 1950s, until sophomore Colton Chapple did it last week. And just when it looked like the brewing quarterback controversy was resolved, Harvard coach Tim Murphy mixed everything up once again.
Senior Collier Winters, who had been out due to injury since the first game of the season, made his second start of the year count. Winters threw five touchdowns and ran for a sixth, passing for 403 yards along the way. His 34 completions were the second-most ever in a game for a Crimson quarterback.
“[Winters] deserved to be our starting quarterback on merit, but also on some of the personal factors, being a fifth-year senior,” Murphy said.
Coming into the game, it was widely assumed that Chapple would get the start. He was listed at the top of the depth chart, and even the stadium’s public announcer broadcasted before Harvard’s first possession that the junior would start.
In the post-game press conference, Murphy said that Winters would be the team’s starter going forward. But after both Chapple and Winters put up back-to-back performances that are among the best single-game efforts in program history, a lot can change in a short period of time.
“I’m not sure we knew that we’d be this solid at quarterback in terms of depth,” Murphy said. “As someone said at the beginning of the season, the most valuable player on your team, or the second-most valuable player on your team, might be your second-string quarterback.”
AIN’T NO STOPPING US NOW
For three quarters, Harvard dominated. But with a huge third period and a touchdown at the beginning of the fourth, Princeton made Saturday’s game a contest.
Harvard took a 35-9 lead four minutes into the second half, and it looked like the team would cruise to another easy victory like the win last week against Bucknell.
But with a flurry of touchdowns, the Tigers almost came all the way back, closing the gap to 42-39 two minutes into the fourth quarter. It’s as close as Princeton would get, but the team certainly put a scare into the Crimson.
“I don’t even know what the difference was [between the first and second halves],” Tigers quarterback Tommy Wornham said. “Once the ball started rolling, it didn’t stop. It was one of those things where momentum kept carrying us through.”
It took Princeton just five plays to score its first touchdown of the half to get to 16 points. Still trailing by 26, the Tigers attempted a surprise onside kick halfway through the third quarter—and it worked.
Princeton recovered and scored 87 seconds later, and a successful two-point conversion made it an 11-point game.
“They’re definitely a tempo offense as well,” captain linebacker Alex Gedeon said. “Once they get going, they’re no huddle, so it’s really important against them to get stops, to get three-and-outs to stop the tempo, and we didn’t do that in the third quarter.”
With 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter, Princeton scored again, and another two-point play brought Princeton all the way back to field-goal range.
The Tigers took advantage of a weakened defense playing without senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz, who left mid-game with a minor concussion, and senior defensive back Matthew Hanson, who hurt his knee in the third. Hanson came back in the fourth quarter.
Winters led a touchdown drive on the next series, capped by a one-yard run from junior Treavor Scales. Princeton didn’t score again in the game, and the Crimson would tack on seven more to seal the win.
“We didn’t tackle well at all today,” Murphy said. “We gave a lot of extra yards we left out on the field. That’s obviously a credit to their offensive line and their backs, but we didn’t tackle.”
REWRITING THE RECORD BOOKS
For a 138-year-old program, football’s record book has been awfully fluid lately.
Against Cornell, Chapple became the third Harvard quarterback to throw for 400 yards in a game.
In the matchup against Bucknell, he became the second to throw five touchdowns.
Against Princeton on Saturday, Winters became the fourth and third quarterbacks to do those exact same things.
In the past three games, the two Harvard quarterbacks have thrown for 14 touchdowns, also a record.
But the individual accomplishments are only part of the story.
The Crimson has scored 40 or more points in three straight games, the first time the team has done that since 1932, when it beat Buffalo, New Hampshire, and Penn State.
The two teams combined for 95 points on Saturday, the most in any game Harvard has played since it beat Wesleyan by the comfortable margin of 124-0 back in 1891. The only modern game that comes close was a 52-37 win over Brown in 1990.
“I’ve never seen anything like [this game],” Murphy said. “Last time I was involved in a game like that was down at the University of Delaware my first year as a head coach in 1987 at Maine. We had to win to go the playoffs, and I think we won 56-53, something like that.”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (7-6, 3-2 Ivy) fell out of first place in the Ivy League standings with a heartbreaking loss on Saturday to Princeton (7-7, 4-1).
The Crimson entered the game in a five-way tie for first place in the Ancient Eight standings, giving the team its best opportunity in recent history to win a title. But the dream became much more difficult to attain with the 4-1 loss at Jordan Field.
Heading into the game, Harvard was excited for the chance to sustain its place in the top spot.
“We were really excited to try to keep first place in the Ivy League,” co-captain Carly Dickson said. “It’s always a great game against Princeton since they are a strong team this year and, we were excited to have a good game against them.”
The Crimson came out strong in the first 15 minutes and controlled the momentum, but it was unable to take the lead before giving up corner opportunities to the Tigers.
“We had some really good preparation,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “In the first 15 minutes or so, it was a great game, and we controlled a lot of the momentum. Then we gave up some corners, and we kind of got back on our heels a bit.”
Princeton gained the momentum of the game with its aggressive offense, leading to several scoring opportunities. Freshman Allison Evans had one 19 minutes into the contest, firing a shot past Crimson goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos.
The Tigers mounted another attack with less than eight minutes remaining in the half. The Harvard defense appeared to make a clean stop with a good defensive play, only to have the referee award Princeton a penalty shot.
Tigers junior Charlotte Krause entered the penalty corner and passed to freshman Sydney Kirby, who placed the ball down for sophomore Amanda Bird. Bird shot the ball past the left side of the goalie for the score, resulting in a 2-0 Princeton lead with seven and a half minutes in the half.
“They got a couple of corners in a row, and that was what I think caused the momentum shift,” Dickson said. “I wish we had gotten a goal in the first 15 minutes when we were playing so well because I think we would have kept the momentum if that happened.”
The score remained 2-0 heading into halftime. The Crimson knew that the third goal would be crucial to the outcome of the contest.
“I think we were okay going into halftime,” Caples said. “We went into halftime with it being 2-0, and we knew that the next goal in a 2-0 game would be pretty important.”
The Tigers came out and once again controlled possession of the ball, leading to two penalty corner and giving them a 9-1 penalty-corner advantage. Princeton had several shots on goal, but Harvard was able to hold on in the first seven minutes of the half and keep the game close.
The Tigers were able to mount another attack, as Evans was able to sneak into the right side of the zone and get off a good shot.
Evans was denied by a great diving save by Tassopoulos, but the ball bounded right back to Evans, who took the rebound and raised a shot over the fallen Tassopoulos into the net, giving the Tigers a commanding 3-0 lead that deflated the Crimson.
“[The goal] put them up, 3-0, and that was tough,” Caples said. “It spiraled a little bit on us, and we played back on our heels instead of attacking. We made some skill error and just lost our momentum. At that point, we need to stay disciplined in our fundamentals and execute the game plan to dig ourselves  [out, but] we weren’t able to get anything going.”
Princeton stretched the lead to four, as senior Rachel Neufeld scored off a rebound that effectively put the game out of reach.
Crimson freshman Noel Painter scored two minutes later, setting the score at 4-1, but the goal was not enough to spark a comeback.
Despite the loss that dropped it to fourth place, Harvard will look to rebound and finish out the season strong.
“Princeton is a strong team but, you know, we are close, and there is still a lot of work to be done for us,” Caples said. “I look forward to see how we respond tomorrow [against Colgate].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a widely held belief that the key to winning close games in intercollegiate athletics is experience and leadership. While co-captains Carly Dickson and Georgia McGilvray both put in impressive performances, tallying five and four shots on goal, respectively, it was the play of two freshmen, Noel Painter and Caitlin Rea, that gave the Crimson the victory.
The Harvard field hockey (8-6, 3-2 Ivy) relied on its youth to pull out an overtime 3-2 victory over Colgate (6-10, 1-3 Patriot) on Sunday.
“Carly and Georgia have done a terrific job stepping up and leading this young team this year,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “And it’s great, because now we can go into overtime and know that we have the weapons we need to come away with the victory. With this being our third overtime win this year, we know what we’re getting into.”
After two contested regulation periods, in which four green cards were issued and two goals were negated by a strict officiating crew, the teams entered the added period even at two goals apiece.
The fifth green card of the game came just over a minute into overtime. It was the second of the game for Colgate forward Halle Biggar, temporarily taking her out of the match and giving the Crimson an opportunity to reclaim an elusive victory. Rea and Painter did just that, connecting on a left-to-right pass that left the defense out of position.
“Caitlin just got me the ball in the circle and I put it in the back of the net,” Painter said. “I’m really glad that I was able to contribute to the team in my way and finish it off. It was definitely a team effort.”
The game-sealing goal was Painter’s second of the game and team-leading eighth of the season. The Harvard freshman is currently fourth in the Ivy League in the category and has potential at being named the conference’s freshman of the year.
“I’m very, very excited with how this season has been going,” Painter said. “We have to focus on getting one percent better every day as a unit. As a freshmen class, and really as a team, we’ve gelled both on the field and off of it, and I think that definitely helps.”
The Crimson dominated possession in the first half and drew first blood with a strike from distance by Rea. After stopping a long pass just outside the shooting circle, Rea deked her defender and unleashed a shot that sliced through the defense and into the left corner untouched.
Rea tallied two assists in addition to her game-opening goal. She found the back of the net on her first shot on goal at Harvard, giving her a 1.000 shooting percentage.
“It felt really good,” Rea said. “I was excited to be in the game, and I think we all had quite a lot of fun out there. It’s definitely a good way to end the weekend.”
The Raiders threatened to tie things up with a penalty corner following a yellow card on junior Molly Stansik. Colgate executed a pass and shoot that forced junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos to dive, stop the shot, and return possession to the Crimson, who ended the half with a one goal advantage. Tassopoulos continued her stellar play, saving nine of 11 shots and maintaining a .812 save percentage—good for second in the Ancient Eight.
“It was a very physical game, and the referees had to do their job and keep it safe, keep it skillful,” Caples said. “That’s what they’re here for.”
Harvard wasn’t so lucky the next time. The Raiders converted a penalty corner at the beginning of the second half to draw the score even, 1-1. Tassopoulos guessed correctly, but Colgate midfielder Lauren Dittman’s shot sailed just over Tassopoulos’ shoulder as she stretched across the left corner of the goal.
With 15 minutes remaining in the period, the Raiders took advantage of another chance. Biggar scored off a rebound to move Colgate ahead, 2-1, after her first two attempts were stifled by Tassopoulos.
The lead was short lived however, as Painter and Rea returned the favor just 36 seconds later. Painter, who received a pass from Rea, knocked one past an outstretched Raider defender to bring the teams even once again and set the stage for overtime.
Harvard is currently tied with Dartmouth for fourth in the Ivy League and, with three games remaining, has a chance to have its first winning record since 2004. The Crimson hosts the Big Green on Saturday, in a matchup that will help shape the Ancient Eight title race.
“We’re going to be working really hard in practice this week,” Painter said. “Dartmouth is going to be a huge game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (10-8, 3-5 Ivy) proved that maintaining a strong game plan makes them hard to beat, as the squad knocked off former first-place Columbia at home. That lesson was further emphasized Saturday night, as the Crimson’s inconsistent passing and defense led to a 3-1 loss at Dartmouth (12-7, 4-4 Ivy).
Despite strong performances from sophomore setter Natalie Doyle and co-captain Christine Wu, both of whom notched double-doubles, Harvard could not stifle the Big Green’s strong performance, led offensively by senior Madeline Baird.
“When we are [playing] in our system, we move as a unit and we all trust each other,” Doyle said. “The effort was there, but the execution was not quite on par.”
Harvard arrived in Hanover after an unbalanced performance last weekend, when the team lost to last-place Cornell on Friday before overpowering the top-seeded Lions the next day. The Crimson was also hoping to avenge its 3-2 loss to Dartmouth at home last month.
“We seemed a little timid,” said co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer, who had 11 kills in the match. “We didn’t have that aggression, that all-out pursuit that we normally see in both our offensive and defensive game.”
Harvard started off strongly, opening up an 11-7 lead over the Big Green in the first set. But, after several attack errors by the Crimson, Dartmouth fought back with a 7-1 run to take the lead and later rode a 4-0 run to close out the first set, 25-22.
The game was full of streaks from both teams, as leads were exchanged throughout. The Big Green would open up an 11-6 lead in the second set behind a strong offensive display from Baird. The senior struck six kills in the game.
But Doyle would go on to serve up 13 of her 44 assists for Harvard in the second set, as the Crimson went on a 9-2 run to reclaim the lead.
Despite the run, errors would bequeath the Big Green a two-point advantage that it would ride out to take the second game, 25-23.
After going down 2-0, Harvard looked to recover its game plan and execution that it had practiced all week.
“After the second game, we went into the locker room for our 10-minute break and got really pumped up,” Doyle said. “We talked about what we needed to do, and we went out and executed.”
The execution showed as Harvard stormed to an 11-5 lead in the third set, with sophomore middle blocker Teresa Skelly recording six of her 11 kills on the day.
Dartmouth would eventually fight back and close the gap to two points at 19-17, but Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss would call a well-timed timeout to stop the Big Green’s momentum. After the squad got back on the floor, Dartmouth would only score two more points, as Harvard took a 25-19 win to make the game, 2-1.
But despite the strong performance in the third set, the Crimson would not maintain the momentum. Like the previous sets, the team failed to execute the game plan and continued to make attack errors. Early in the fourth set, the Big Green generated a 5-0 run to take a dominant 8-3 lead.
“The third game was a fun one to watch because that was Harvard volleyball,” Doyle said. “But … in the fourth game, we had balls drop, we had miscommunications, and for some reason, the Harvard system was not there.”
That characterized the fourth set, as Dartmouth would add another 4-0 run late to take the set and the match, 25-15.
Harvard is going into this week of practice hoping to improve team communication and execution before hosting a pair of critical Ancient Eight games next weekend against Penn and Princeton.
“We are going to work on playing more as a unit, communicating more, and keeping up positive energy on court,” Fryhofer said. “We became too individual … We’re going to focus on our team, and how we can make each other better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team finished its 2010-2011 season with a flurry of goals and wins, and its improbable late-season run nearly earned the squad a spot in the third round of the ECAC playoffs.
In Friday's exhibition match against Western Ontario, the offense picked up just where it had left off.
In an impressive scoring display, the Crimson bested the visiting Mustangs in a 7-4 victory at the Bright Hockey Center.
“There are a lot of good things to look at [in this game], and certainly a lot of things to improve on if we want to have some success,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
The Harvard scoring onslaught began just minutes into the contest.
After the teams traded shots early on, junior forward Marshall Everson received the puck near the red line with no one in front of him. In a one-on-one against Western Ontario goaltender Alain Valiquette, Everson came out on top, slipping the puck by Valiquette’s right foot to give the home team the early one-goal advantage.
But the first period scoring was far from over for Harvard. Seven minutes later, junior forward Luke Grenier skillfully deflected a pass from sophomore defenseman Danny Fick past the Mustang netminder to double the Crimson lead.
And like at the end of last season, the Crimson power play was in high gear. With a one-man advantage at the 13:48 mark in the first, senior forward Alex Killorn, last year’s leading goalscorer for the Crimson, made it a 3-0 game.
Just a little more than 10 minutes later, early in the second frame, Harvard took advantage of the power play again, with junior Conor Morrison finishing off a strong Crimson passing display.
After Harvard tacked on another score just 1:24 later—giving the home team the commanding 5-0 lead—the momentum began to shift.
Western Ontario finally got on the board 7:23 into the period, when sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard couldn’t hold on to a Mustang shot, and Western Ontario forward Shaun Furlong pounded the rebound between Girard’s legs.
When Girard was replaced by freshman goaltender Stephen Michalek with 9:05 remaining—as was planned before the contest—the visitors took advantage.
In his first collegiate performance, Michalek struggled early on. In his nine minutes between the pipes in the second frame, the Mustangs found the back of the net three times, narrowing the score to 5-4.
“The second period got away from us a little bit,” Donato said. “We made some poor decisions with the puck, took some penalties, and turned the puck over a bunch.”
Harvard bounched back in the final frame. Michalek settled down, keeping the visitors off the board to assure the victory. And in the end, the Harvard offense—and its strong power play—proved to be too much for Western Ontario.
Twice in the final 10 minutes, the Crimson found the back of the net, both times on power plays. With 10:37 left to play, Morrison snuck one past Valiquette. Just four minutes later, Killorn followed suit, finding the back of the net to earn his third point of the game and putting the contest out of reach.
“One of the things that really excited me was in the third period, after having a tough second [period], our power play came out and had a big goal—a timely goal,” Donato said. “We faced some adversity, and it was a nice opportunity to come out and have a good period, and I thought we did.”

One week after the Bruins paraded their Stanley Cup trophy through Harvard Square, the Harvard women’s hockey team earned a celebration of its own.
On Saturday night, the Crimson took on McGill in its first exhibition game and defeated the Martlets, 3-1. Despite the scoreless first period, Harvard’s offense took off with 3:42 left in the second with a goal by junior forward Jillian Dempsey. Her score was followed by goals from sophomores Kalley Armstrong and Gina McDonald with 8:03 and 0:20 left in the game, respectively.
“I think it was a great way to get started,” Dempsey said. “It’s awesome to be back in the jersey. We have an amazing squad this year, and a lot of really good freshmen are coming up. This game showed that we have a lot of things we have to work on and develop, but overall, I think we’re really happy.”
Throughout the scoreless first period, the biggest disparity was the number of penalties called on the Crimson as opposed to McGill. While the Martlets only had one penalty, Harvard tallied four. But because of the high total, the team was able to prove its strength in penalty kill.
“We had to kill a lot of five on three [penalties],” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “That was definitely good practice for us. But we have to stay out of the box, stay aggressive, and use our sticks better. Overall though, we’re getting it. We have a lot of kids who have played in kills before, but we have to stay out of the box. That’s number one.”
Dempsey agreed with Stone, emphasizing the importance of the penalty kill.
“We’re really happy with how our penalty kill went, though we obviously don’t want to be giving up that many penalties,” Dempsey said. “We’ve done a lot of practice on the PK, and since we worked on that so much, it turned out really great. Everybody played hard and hustled.”
At the 9:13 mark of the second period, McGill’s Leslie Oles took advantage of a Harvard penalty and was the first player to put the puck in the net to give the Martlets a 1-0 lead after a quick pass from teammate Melodie Daoust. But, the Crimson was not at a disadvantage for long as Dempsey followed-up with a goal of her own.
“I got it in the middle and was on a two-on-one with [sophomore Lindsey Fry],” Dempsey said. “The defenseman shaded over to Fry, so I didn’t have the passing option. I just faked a shot, pulled it over to the left, shot it towards the top corner, and it went in.”
The goal was a result of a slotted pass from McDonald, who earned the assist on the play.
“I saw her flying up the middle of the ice when I got the pass from [sophomore Marissa Gedman],” McDonald said. “I touched it to the middle for Jillian to pick up, and she took it down the ice, faked out the goalie, and put it away.”
Four penalties later, Armstrong led a break, dribbling the puck down the right side of the ice and ultimately finishing with a score.
“I saw Gina and really actually wanted to pass to her,” Armstrong explained. “But I guess last minute I just decided to throw it towards the net. The support of my teammates right then was awesome and really helped my play.”
Not to be outdone, McDonald followed Armstrong’s path down the right side of the ice, and rounded off the score, 3-1, with a goal of her own. Twenty seconds later, the game was complete, and Harvard won its first matchup of the season. Along with the strong offensive showing, both teams’ goalkeepers came through and kept the game under control. For the Martlets, goalkeeper Charlene Labonte saved 28 out of the Crimson’s 31 shots.
“Both goaltenders did fantastically today, I thought,” Stone said. “On offense, we had some pretty good opportunities, but their goalkeeper kept them in the game. It could have been a very different score without that. Our goalkeepers also kept us in the game, so overall, it was pretty encouraging.”
With one game under its belt, the Crimson is one victory closer to regaining the Ivy League title that it captured in 2008 and 2009. Armstrong, who missed out on the championship years, knows what it will take to get her team to that level.
“One of our strengths is definitely our speed,” Armstrong said. “As we also have a very short bench, I feel like we can take advantage of that speed ... Our chemistry looks good, and it’ll get better, so this game was a really good start to our season. We’ll go from there, and we’ll be good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s water polo team, last weekend’s trip to California was anything but a beach vacation.
The Crimson (6-14, 6-9 CWPA) went 0-5 in The Rodeo, an 18-game invitational tournament hosted by Santa Clara University. Of the nine teams in the field, seven ranked among the top 20 in the nation.
“We came into this tournament knowing that we were going to play some of the toughest competition in the country,” sophomore attacker William Roller said. “We had the expectation that this trip was going to be a learning experience of seeing how these top programs play.”
SANTA CLARA 13, HARVARD 4
The Crimson finished tournament play with a 13-4 loss to No. 15 Santa Clara (15-12). The Broncos dominated the first half, outscoring Harvard 13-2. Freshman two-meter John Holland-McCowan and freshman utility player Max Murphy both scored in the first half for the Crimson. Harvard finished the match on a positive note, with senior attacker Evan Zepfel and Murphy scoring in the final frame.
Although the Crimson left California without a win, the team values the experience.
“We were looking to get better against some of the top competition in the country so that we can achieve our goal, which is to do well at [the Northern Championships] in two weeks and make [the Eastern Championship],” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said.
PEPPERDINE 20, HARVARD 2
The Crimson resumed play on Sunday, losing its first game of the day to No. 6 Pepperdine (12-8) by a score of 20-2. The Waves scored seven straight goals to open the game before Harvard rookie Evan Ramsey and sophomore attacker William Roller scored consecutive goals to put Harvard on the scoreboard. Pepperdine netted another goal just before halftime and followed with 12 more unanswered goals in the second half to seal the win.
STANFORD 19, HARVARD 3
Things did not get any easier for the Crimson, as it fell No. 3 Stanford (13-3) in the second of Saturday’s two games, 19-3.
Falling behind 6-0 at the end of the first quarter, Harvard struggled to slow down a balanced Cardinal offensive attack that saw 11 different players score at least one goal.
“Stanford was definitely the best team we’ve played all year,” Minnis said. “They’re big, they’re fast and strong, and I think we learned what we need to do to go up under pressure.”
UC DAVIS 20, HARVARD 2
In its first game on Saturday, Harvard was blown out by No. 12 UC Davis (18-7) by a score of 20-2.
Both teams scored in the first two minutes, with co-captain Kevin DiSilvestro netting his only goal of the game to tie the score at one. Aggie senior center Aaron Salit answered back tallying three of UC Davis’s five consecutive first quarter goals to take the lead for good.
The Crimson showed a glimpse of promise in the second quarter. Ramsey scored his first goal of the tournament, cutting the Aggie lead to four, but Harvard was unable to put another shot into the back of the net, and UC Davis ran away with the win.
CAL BAPTIST 12, HARVARD 10
The Crimson opened its schedule with an overtime loss to No. 18 Cal Baptist (20-6) on Friday night. Junior utility player Scott Gleason netted two goals in the extra period to seal the victory for the Lancers.
Harvard trailed 3-2 at the end of the first quarter, with DiSilvestro scoring the Crimson’s only two goals of the frame. Cal Baptist outscored Harvard again in the second period, firing two more shots into the back of the net. Zepfel scored the Crimson’s only second period goal to cut the Cal Baptist lead to 5-3 going into halftime.
Offense dominated in the third quarter, with both teams scoring four goals. Harvard junior two-meter player Max Eliot scored both of his goals in the third quarter to keep the Crimson deficit at two.
It seemed that Cal Baptist would easily pull away with the win, taking a three-goal lead with a tally early in the fourth quarter, but Roller scored back-to-back goals, and DiSilvestro completed his hat trick to send the game into overtime, where UC Davis won, 12-10.
“We wanted it more than them,” senior goalie Alexandre Popp said. “Unfortunately, they had two quick goals in the overtime period, and we couldn’t come back. It was a good battle, and it really reaffirmed our belief that we can play with anyone in the nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Washington may be the defending national champions, but the Charles is Harvard’s river.
And on Sunday in the Championship Eight event of the Head of the Charles, the Crimson commanded it.
Harvard’s varsity eight finished nearly six seconds ahead of USRowing and 8.5 second ahead of the Huskies, the second fastest collegiate crew of the day.
“It was a good day at the office,” said junior bow seat James O’Connor.
Washington, last year’s Head of the Charles champions, started just ahead of the Crimson, but Harvard was able to resist the temptation of focusing on its competition too early.
“The first mile, we just kind of did our own thing,” O’Connor said. “We just settled into a really good rhythm.”
About a mile in, the crew took its move.
“By the one-third mark, [junior] David [Fuller], our coxswain, was telling us that we were catching Washington, and we got really excited” said senior seven seat Matt Edstein.
“We really revved it up from there,” O’Connor added. “Sitting in the bow seat, I could see [sophomore] Andy Holmes and [junior Josh] ‘Hicksy’ [Hicks] just jump on it. They got the fire in their bellies; it was really good.”
The chase continued until the Crimson was finally able to gain overlap with the Huskies around the Eliot bridge.
“We were sitting in their dirty water for a while, sitting in their puddles,” O’Connor said. “We got a bit of overlap. We managed to push right in front of them.”
But because Harvard had fought so hard for the inside of the Eliot turn, it yielded the final turn of the day to Washington, which allowed the Huskies to finish with open water.
“It was good to catch them for at least a little bit,” Edstein said.
And the ground the Crimson had gained over the course of the race was enough to give it a substantial lead.
“This told us that what we’ve been doing has been pretty strong,” Edstein said. “At the end of the day, our big race is in eight months. It’s a good encouragement that if we slack off, the other crews aren’t that far behind.”
Harvard’s top championship four entry took fourth. The Crimson prioritized its top eight ahead of its top four, but not all programs followed suit, meaning that Harvard’s rowers were competing against many programs’ top athletes.
“It was not our best row; it was a pretty ... rocky row,” said senior bow seat Nick Jordan. “But we were very aggressive with it, so we had a good result.”
While the Crimson fell to the University of Wisconsin, the University of California, and the U.S. Naval Academy, it was able to beat Stanford’s top four and the U.S. rowing development team entry.
Harvard’s second championship entry took 15th, and its third champ eight took 21st. In Saturday’s club eight events, the Crimson heavyweights posted third and 22nd place finishes.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Only the USRowing eight, stroked by Will Newell ’11, separated the Harvard lightweights from sharing the limelight with the Crimson heavyweights. Harvard will just have to be content with being the fastest collegiate crew by nearly 14 seconds.
Starting third behind Princeton and Cornell, the Crimson 1V surged into second place before it got to Newell Boathouse.
“We were catching up to Cornell and sort of caught them by the Weeks footbridge,” said junior four seat Stu Taylor. “We passed Cornell going past Weld.”
“We just ripped it out,” added sophomore bow seat Michael Wales. “It was so cool to be in the boat with a bunch of legends ... I had a blast. It was just a lot of fun, the whole thing.”
Harvard’s second varsity, meanwhile, took 13th overall. The Crimson was the second fastest 2V and finished a little over a second behind the 12th-place Tigers’ 2V.
“It’s a building process for the JV this season,” said captain and six seat Tom Nesel. “We started off pretty well. We held off many fast crews into Eliot Bridge ... A lot of guys had a lot of heart, and they gave it all they had.”
Newell, captain of the 2010-2011 team, and the USRowing boat won by over 14 seconds.
After the top two eights, Harvard’s next priority boat was the lightweight four, which also took 13th overall.
“There were some very good stretches,” said senior bow seat Collin Rees. “We felt like we really got it going.”
The Crimson lightweights’ other two events were the club eight and the club four. Competing against mostly heavyweight crews, Harvard took third in the club four and 20th in the club eight.
“This weekend was probably one of our best showings,” Taylor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what has become the largest two-day rowing competition in the world, an estimated 319,000 spectators flocked to the banks of the Charles River this past weekend for the 47th annual Head of the Charles Regatta.
The Radcliffe heavyweights and lightweights, coming off strong performances at the Head of the Housatonic Regatta, returned to their home course hoping some of that momentum would carry over.
The heavyweight 1V was the top Ivy to finish in the Championship Eights, coming in second place behind winner UVA. The 2V finished in 22nd place in the same event. In the Championship  Fours, the 4V captured eighth place out of 20 boats. The lightweight 1V and 2V captured third and fifth place, respectively, in the Lightweight Eights race, and the 4V captured ninth place out of 14 entrants in the Lightweight Fours.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
After a pair of second-place finishes in the Varsity Eight and Varsity Four at the Head of the Housatonic Regatta, the Black and White heavyweights were eager to make a strong statement at the Head of the Charles.
“We went into the race ready to give it our all and go our hardest,” junior Scout Moran said. “We were up against some fierce competitors, but we were quite pleased with our results. The Head of the Charles is a really fun time, and everyone brings their A-game, so it was thrilling to see how we did.”
In the women’s Championship Eight race of the Head of the Charles Regatta, the Black and White heavyweights fielded two boats.  The 1V and 2V finished the course in 16:19.63 and 17:15.4 to earn a second- and 22nd-place finishes, respectively.
Although the 1V finished just eight seconds shy of UVA and the Championship Eight title, this has only increased the determination of the Black and White to improve for the spring season.
“Eight seconds, really?” said Moran after hearing of her boat’s final time. “Bring it on! I’m excited to start training, and UVA will be in our minds.”
In its first event of the regatta on Saturday, Radcliffe finished in 13th-place in the Club Eight event in 19:00.76.
With that time, the Black and White finished firmly in the middle of the race among 28 entrants.
In the second day of the Regatta, Radcliffe took to the waters for the Championship Four event.
Led by freshman Eliza Flint, sophomore Deva Steketee, and juniors Marisa D’Orsogna and Jessica Mealia, the Black and White Heavyweight 4V completed the course in a time of 19:05.19, earning an eighth-place finish. Ivy foes Yale and Brown edged out Radcliffe with sixth- and seventh-place finishes, respectively, while the Vesper Boat Club took first-place.
As the heavyweights look toward to the upcoming Foot of the Charles regatta in mid November and the spring competitive season, the rowers look to take some of the lessons learned at the Head of the Charles to their future competitions.
“I think the races we had this weekend reminded us how we have to race fearlessly,” Moran said. “This weekend, we had complete trust in our coxswain and our stroke. We weren’t concerned about where we were in relation to the other boats. So I think that sense of fearlessness is one that we hope to take into our future practices and races.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Under the leadership of new Radcliffe coach Michiel Bartman, the lightweights looked to pick up where they left off last season. The Black and White did not disappoint, as all three crews finished in the top 10 of their respective races.
“I think it was a great showing for our team,” senior coxswain Maryana Vrubel. “We went out on the course with a lot of focus, and we did pretty well. But the fall season is the fall season. It’s when we build up for the spring season, and I think we showed that we are incredibly strong and that we have a lot to work with on our team.”
With times of 17:17.19 and 18:20.20, the lightweight 1V and 2V finished in third and fifth place, respectively, in the women’s Lightweight Eight race. The Black and White 1V finished just over a second behind second-place Stanford but nearly 24 seconds behind first-place Wisconsin.
Ancient Eight rival Princeton, who was due to compete in the race, was scratched off the starting lineup.
The Radcliffe 4V finished the course in  20:26.19 to earn a ninth-place finish. The Vesper Boat Club—Bartman’s former team—came in first place in the women’s Lightweight Fours.

Crayons, face painting, laughing for no reason: these are the things of our childhood. When writing a ten-page paper or working on a CS50 problem set, students might wish they were just back in their kindergarten class for nap time. But other than carefree days, what else have we lost as we grow older?
According to Jason Jedrusiak, a graduate of Northeastern College and proponent of laughter meditation, as we grow older, we lose our ability to freely laugh. As Jedrusiak points out, babies laugh more than 200 times a day, while the average adult only laughs around 30 times a day.
Hoping to promote that youthful carefree feeling and simple happiness, The Happiness Project asked Jedrusiak to lead a laughter meditation session on October 19. For an hour, The HappyNest in the SOCH was filled with bouts of laughter and cheery giggles as students took their mind of the stress of college and indulged in some relaxing fun.

When people think of Harvard their minds often wander to red brick buildings filled with students eagerly studying to become future lawyers or politicians. But those thoughts may soon shift to include the likes of Shakespeare and Fitzgerald.
U.S. News and World Report ranked Harvard as the number one university in the world to get an English degree. Rankings are based on data gathered by the QS World Survey, a company that gathers comparative data on universities and organizations.
Three years ago the English Department restructured concentration requirements to better cater to students' needs, according to Professor of English Stephen L. Burt.
"Rather than requiring a two-semester lecture course, we instead require four seminar-sized courses that can be taken in any order," Burt said.
W. James Simpson, chair of the English Department, said that the department's top-notch faculty make it stand out.
"We need to keep focused on our graduates and keep hiring great faculty to stay on top," Simpson said.
Rounding off the top five are University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, University of California at Berkeley, and Yale University.
"Of course this isn't about competition, but we're happy they liked us," Burt said.
He makes a good point: with Yale lagging behind who needs to worry?
