After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many Harvard courses, lecture attendance falls victim to an all-too-common plight: After shopping week lecture halls—overbrimming with students sitting crisscross in aisles—attendance slowly but persistently decays, until classes are practically vacant. By the semester’s end, attendance is generally below 50 percent. 
This phenomenon, which most Harvard students probably witness or contribute to on a semesterly basis, is borne out by research conducted by the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching in the fall of 2014.
The plausible reasons for this deflation are varied. Students may prioritize catching up on sleep or homework over going to class. Likewise, Harvard students’ bustling lifestyles may result in conflicting commitments. Perhaps midterm study crunches cause students to make one-week exceptions for themselves, which then solidify into habitual lecture dereliction. More cynically, students who would under regular circumstances attend lectures may imitate their more apathetic counterparts, for fear of showing excessive investment in a class.
Regardless of the exact rationale for their absences, students know they can catch up at their leisure; by virtue of near-universal lecture videotaping, students can ingest lectures at 1.5 times speed on their laptops whenever and wherever they please, ensconced in their dormitories or tucked away in a library. Ironically, students may skip lectures on occasion to watch other lectures they have missed, sparking an insidious positive feedback loop of chronic absence.
Despite its normality, the culture surrounding lecture attendance erodes the very foundations of undergraduate learning at Harvard. The lecture is the most basic unit of knowledge transfer at a university. In opting to ditch them, undergraduates are forgoing the privilege to take part in an intimate learning community and reducing a substantial component of their college experience to the consumption of videos.
The superiority of lecture attendance is so evident as to hardly merit justification. On a practical level, the benefits of actually going to class include the opportunity to interact and collaborate with peers, the ability to ask questions, and greater focus afforded by physical immediacy, among others.
Worse, poor lecture attendance is a double-edged sword, impacting faculty and students alike. Students’ presence is a basic gesture of decency and respect toward lecturers, whose time comes at as high a premium as ours. If lecture videos truly exceed the value of in-person lectures, as many an undergraduates’ habits suggest, instructors should be able to publish videos from years past to students enrolled in a class, rather than go through the strain and indignity of presenting to half-vacant auditoriums. A deep hypocrisy also underlies Harvard students’ indifference to lectures: on the one hand, we pine for faculty accessibility, but on the other, we lack a commitment to our most elementary form of interaction with professors.
All of this is not to categorically condemn lecture videotaping; it is simply to argue that videos should supplement rather than supplant lecture attendance. Videos are indispensable for review and make-up for occasional absences.
Nevertheless, the culture surrounding lecture attendance begs the question of how students can be encouraged to attend lectures. It is a thorny issue to address, since responsibility is particularly diffuse; any individual absence can pass under the radar, but absences en masse are painfully noticeable. Top-down approaches such as attendance tracking or grading stoop down to the level of coercion and paternalism, straining the relationship between the lecturer and the lectured. Similarly, petty tactics like pre-lecture spectacles degrade the classroom, conflating academics and entertainment.
Perhaps the best solution, if a little quixotic, is for each undergraduate to come to appreciate the privilege to attend lectures in person, and to act accordingly. Harvard students travel from every corner of the globe for the opportunity to study in Cambridge—why can't we take a stroll across the Yard to class?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I knew summer was coming to an end not because my calendar changed to August or back-to-school sale advertisements started up, but by the daily increasing number of emails I received on my Harvard College account. I didn’t want to face the reality. I remember all too well the unexpected sense of loss that comes with deleting emails that publicize events, throwing away fliers placed at my door, and ignoring the people posted in the dining hall. I’ve come to identify this feeling, which hints of disappointment but also relief, as FOMO—fear of missing out.
FOMO is an acronym I was not familiar with until I stepped foot on this campus a year ago. Yet, it quickly becomes this ever-present, tangible thing that students—including me—battle with regardless of class year. It is relevant in many situations, but mainly the amazing opportunities that can’t fit nicely into your schedule with classes, work, and extracurricular activities.
There is always something going on that you could be a part of, and it easily leads to getting caught up on what you would be missing out on—the possibility of meeting new people, making connections that could be important in the future, or even experiencing something that could totally change your life’s course. With all these possibilities left unexplored, it seems like with every choice comes a missed opportunity.
Harvard is an amazing place that provides so many daily opportunities that we are privileged to have. We have access to nationally and internationally known figures who frequently come to campus and interact with students, award-winning professors and scholars, and so many free resources. It is truly humbling that this is our normal. But as the emails advertising various talks, meetings, and other events flood my inbox, it quickly becomes overwhelming. It gets to a point where I have to start blocking anything more out because my mind, much like my calendar, is already full of dates. There is an anxiety that comes with realizing the enormity of a task, even if it is just showing up.
Every opportunity is so wonderful that it seems foolish to turn any of them down. Realizing that these perks are a part of the privilege I have through attending this college, I feel guilty when I ignore the notifications. When family and friends back home ask about my college experience, they don’t want to hear about my difficult classes and heavy workload. That’s to be expected—after all, it is Harvard—and students from other schools can easily say the same. They want to hear about the famous people I met and the unique experiences that could only happen at Harvard.
This leads me to ask myself, am I really making the most of my Harvard experience? Probably not. But, at the same time, if I tried to make room for everything, something would pay the price. Grades would plummet as I cut into study time or my health would be compromised as my hours of sleep progressively decrease. It is hard to admit, but even as students at one of the best universities in the world, we can’t have it all.
So once we’ve come to terms with that reality, how do we handle this fear that will only persist as our time here comes closer to an end? We must first remember who we are and own it. It sounds cliché, but it’s true.
Because too often, the fear of missing out causes us to do things we wouldn’t normally do or stress ourselves by trying to accommodate every opportunity, just for the sake of what could be. In the process, we lose ourselves.
Instead, if you are sure of yourself and your decisions, there will be no need to worry about missing out. Stand firm regardless of what your friends or peers are doing. You know yourself best, so you know what you need at any particular time. Don’t confuse your interests with those of others. If a Supreme Court justice is visiting campus and your friends who are into government get super excited, that’s great; but if that doesn’t personally excite you, don’t waste your time.
Granted, college is all about trying new things and exploring interests you never knew you had, but not every interest is worth the opportunity cost that comes with exploring it. The question that then arises is how will you know if this random opportunity is worth it? The truth is, you don’t. But, I’m a firm believer in things happening naturally: if it feels forced, like you’re going through multiple obstacles just to make this one small thing happen, then it’s not meant to be.
Finally, before we let the fear of missing out consume our every thought, we need to remind ourselves that tomorrow is another day. With a new day comes new opportunities. Saying no every once in awhile, or even often, in the grand scheme of things won’t have that great of an effect on the quality of our eight semesters at Harvard. It’s really about seizing every moment we say yes and creating memories that will make us glad we had the power to say no when necessary, simply because it made our yeses—though farther apart—that much more worthwhile.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For more than a year, conversations about potential graduate student unionization were overshadowed by a pending decision from the National Labor Relations Board about whether graduate students have the right to unionize.
But following a recent board ruling that graduate students have a right to hold a vote to unionize, this obstacle has been removed. The 3-1 ruling—overturning a precedent from 2004 that private universities did not have to recognize graduate student unions—clears the way for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers’ push for collective bargaining rights.
This victory for advocates of unionization contrasts sharply with statements made by Harvard administrators, among them University President Drew G. Faust, who believe that unionization would harm faculty-student relationships by transforming them into adversarial employer-employee relationships.
Graduate students, by virtue of the teaching appointments they hold and the research they conduct, function as employees as well as students, so the decision to offer them the option to bargain collectively is a commendable one. Ultimately, the decision of whether to unionize is one that the graduate student body must make. But, as employees of Harvard, they should, and now do, have every right to make it for themselves.
There are legitimate arguments for and against unionization. On the one hand, the union's rights are valuable bargaining tools for graduate students in their interactions with Harvard’s administration. As we have previously opined, even the possibility of unionization has gained leverage for graduate students seeking to bargain with the administration.
Furthermore, there is considerable enthusiasm within the graduate student body for the prospect of unionization, as more than 60 percent of graduate students employed by the University have already signed authorization cards calling for a vote on the creation of a union—twice the 30 percent threshold for a vote.
Despite students’ eagerness, however, the NLRB's ruling neither necessitates nor justifies unionization. Reservations held by the administration, and even some graduate students, are legitimate ones.
Faust, for instance, has warned of the potential degradation of the sacrosanct faculty-student relationship to a transactional employer-employee dynamic. Likewise, recently improved parental accommodations demonstrate that graduate students can secure improved benefits without a union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This fall, students enrolled in CS50, Harvard’s behemoth introductory Computer Science course, will only be asked to attend two lectures in person. The new policy, one of a host of changes announced by CS50 course instructor David J. Malan ’99 in a recent Medium post, is part of a broad-based effort to streamline the course in its 10th year under Malan’s charge.
While students have long had the option of watching the course’s lectures online rather than in person—CS50 is the only course at the College that allows students to enroll in a different course during the same time slot—the latest bevy of changes to Harvard’s flagship computer science course will entirely replace Wednesday lectures with “walkthroughs” of that week’s problem set. On Mondays, meanwhile, Malan and course staff will generally film the coming week’s lectures in sessions that are open to, but not required of, students. 
Other changes to this year’s iteration of CS50 include “trimmer” problem sets, re-worked office hours and question-answering resources, and even filming in virtual reality. The changes, according to Malan’s post, are a result of course staff going “back to first principles” after explosive growth and modest dips in student evaluations of the course’s problem sets over the past few years.
Members of the Class of 2020, many of whom are sure to enroll in CS50, will likely be hopeful that the course's reworked office hours—there will now be far more times a student could potentially seek help from teaching staff—will ease the congestion and competition for assistance from TFs that has characterized CS50’s office hours for the past few years.
Since taking over CS50, Malan has turned what was once a wonky course of middling popularity into, by many metrics, the most popular class Harvard offers. Last year, for instance, the course had 750 enrolled undergraduates, compared with just 132 in the fall of 2006. Malan’s course is known by and has drawn mild criticism for its carnival atmosphere, complete with a DJ, puppets, and sizzle reels.
Despite sizeable operations at Harvard and Yale, where CS50 began satellite operations last year, CS50’s reach has expanded far beyond the purview of undergraduate education. More than 1.1 million people have viewed lectures through the CS50x online course since it launched on Harvard co-founded online education platform edX. More recently, CS50 has expanded into high school computer science education this past year with a pilot program of around 40 schools that drew largely positive reviews. This year, the course held “hackathons” in both London and New York.
"While CS50 was once a course... it's now become in our minds more of an umbrella term of any number of educational, technological, and video-oriented experiments and research developments,” said Malan while discussing CS50 research and development in a YouTube video this year.
Though apparently popular, these extra-Harvard operations are far from cheap. According to the same video, CS50 employs a staff of roughly 100 undergraduates, graduate students, and full-time professionals. To finance these operations, the course accepts sponsorships from companies, a practice no other Harvard course employs and that is the subject of some criticism among undergraduates and certain professors at peer institutions.
One CS50 sponsor, Microsoft, had a sizeable role in developing the curriculum for CS50 AP, though School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III said last semester that “appropriate separation” has been maintained between corporate sponsors and the course’s curriculum. In the same interview, Doyle said that SEAS maintained oversight over sponsorship cash coming into the course. 
The course was also the subject of an apparent trademark tussle in 2012, when Harvard filed a motion to block Malan’s trademark applications for “CS50” and “THIS IS CS50." Neither Malan nor administrators responded to requests last spring for comment on the filings. Malan and course preceptor Douglas R. Lloyd ’09 did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion, will leave her position this October, adding to recent administrative shakeup within the Office of Student Life.
Dela Peña's departure for a new position at Washington University at St. Louis, announced in an email to College staff by new Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, comes at a busy time for the school's student life branch. Over the past year, the College has sought to rein in its unrecognized social organizations and implement recommendations from a diversity and inclusion working group.
Dela Peña was the first administrator to hold her particular position, and in her time at the College she oversaw the rollout of a new bias reporting system and assisted Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in developing a response to a sexual assault prevention report released in March. She also sat in with him and other College administrators on several meetings with single gender social organizations last year in the hopes of negotiating with them to go gender-neutral. 
 One of dela Peña's smaller initiatives last year sparked wide criticism. Last winter, dela Peña’s office and the Freshman Dean’s Office released a poster in the shape of a placemat meant to guide students through family conversations about race over the holidays. The placemats that drew ire and criticism for what some called administrative overreach and political correctness. Even University President Drew G. Faust joined the critics, calling the posters “a really bad idea.”
Dela Peña said that her's and Khurana’s work to curb the influence of single-gender, unrecognized social groups had “nothing to do” with the timing of her transition. In fact, prior to her decision to leave the College, dela Peña noted she was looking forward to “continuing the conversation” about exclusivity and gender equity in Harvard’s social scene this year, as well as overseeing the rollout of the College's policy starting with the Class of 2021.
“I wish I could have seen through the implementation of the policy,” she said.
Dela Peña’s position was created in 2014, and she said the Office of Student Life will launch a national search for her replacement in “coming weeks.” In the interim period, O’Dair will supervise the directors of the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the Women’s Center, and Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Dela Peña’s follows a recent string of departures at the Office of Student Life. Khurana announced the resignation of former Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde last January, and this summer the College announced a permanent replacement— O’Dair. Also this summer, former Director of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey left the College for a position at the University of Miami.
Dela Peña said she found the College to be a positive working environment.
“I don’t think there’s anything in the climate that is making us flee the campus. I loved my time here, and I really appreciate what Harvard has done for me,” she said.
According to O’Dair’s announcement, dela Peña will officially vacate her deanship on Oct. 20. In St. Louis, her official title will be associate vice chancellor for student affairs, as well as dean for the Center of Diversity and Inclusion.

The potential removal of iconic local business Out of Town News and plans to renovate the store's kiosk have sparked outcry among Cambridge residents, even though the structure itself is not slated for demolition. 
The City of Cambridge, which currently leases the kiosk to Muckey’s Corporation, is planning to begin a renovation of Harvard Square’s central plaza in 2017. Muckey’s has owned Out of Town News since Hudson News dropped its lease in 2008.  While no plans have officially specified what the kiosk will hold following the renovations, the space may not include the store known for its sale of newspapers and magazines from around the world.
The $4.6 million renovation plans to “open up the historic kiosk building for more public use, enhance the historic character of the building, and build on its iconic presence,” according to the city’s recently approved Fiscal Year 2017 Budget.  The proposed renovation will revert the kiosk to its appearance before the inclusion of Out of Town News in 1984, according to Charles Sullivan, executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission.
Public response to the new design and potential removal of Out of Town News has been widespread. On Monday, six Harvard professors wrote a letter to the editor in The Crimson critiquing the proposed changes. Local restaurant Bartley’s Burgers displayed a colorful sign at its entrance with “Save Out of Town News” emblazoned in chalk.
Online, a change.org petition started by local organization "Our Harvard Square" has gathered signatures from more than 200 supporters, claiming “the design makeover proposes major changes, including stripping the historic ‘Kane-Gonic’ brickwork wall structure, replacement of window panels with LED-illuminated glass, and the loss of historic iron detailing, woodwork and pendant lighting.”
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and member of Our Harvard Square, said the group was formed in response to the city’s plans for renovation.
“[Our Harvard Square] is a group of individuals who became aware of the fast-moving events around the redevelopment of Harvard Square and most importantly the question of the kiosk,” Blier said. “We realized specifically, for preservation of the Harvard Square kiosk, that it was really important to bring in broader local, national, and international support.”
The petition and Monday’s letter to the editor request that the Cambridge City Council grant the kiosk “landmark” status to preserve the building’s historical integrity.
However, the kiosk has been on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places since 1978, and is within the jurisdiction of the Harvard Square Conservation District. Landmark status from the City Council would do little to change its current protected status in Cambridge, Sullivan said.
“It would be duplicative to designate it as a landmark,” he said. “Harvard Square has been designated as a conservation district since the year 2000.”
However, landmark status is important to Our Harvard Square, Blier said.
“We want to give the kiosk as much protection as possible to safeguard its core historical features,” she said. “To give the kiosk landmark status is up to the City Council because they own the building and could easily do it.”
Sullivan said he believes that many of the proposed controversial changes are minor.
“People don't understand how the structure was originally designed,” Sullivan said. “The whole thing was transparent, and that’s what this proposed design will recapture. So no original aspect is being torn away, with minor exceptions, and the only new inclusion is the glass.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the planned renovations would modernize the kiosk and the surrounding plaza. In its current form, the plaza, especially the area known as “the pit,” isn’t fully handicap-accessible, according to Jillson.
“Some people say ‘oh my goodness, they’re moving out a locally-owned independent’ and of course that is a concern, but the reality is that it is public land,” Jillson said. “The reality is that most people aren’t getting their news from a newspaper, and we can’t change that.”
The city began preliminary discussions and hearings about the proposed renovations in 2013, according to City Councillor Jan Devereux. Over the summer, a City Council committee held a hearing to allow community members to voice their concerns with the project.
“I think there is a fair amount of misunderstanding and overall angst about change,” Devereux said. “Harvard Square is psychologically and culturally important for a lot of people who have had any association with Cambridge, whether as a student at Harvard 40 years ago or as a resident.”

UPDATED: August 31, 2016, at 11:29 a.m.
Students returning to campus for the fall semester were greeted by a number of new businesses in Harvard Square, with several more preparing to open in the coming weeks.
Tom’s Bao Bao, a restaurant specializing in Chinese buns, opened its doors earlier this month in the former location of Yogurtland, and quickly drew customers. The eatery boasts large open windows that allow customers to see the buns as they are being prepared.
“The retail space is terrific. It’s really cool,” Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said. “They’ve done a great job with Tom’s Bao Bao.”
According to Jillson, students can also look forward to the opening of several other establishments in the Square within the next six to eight weeks as well.
The Hourly, an oyster bar owned by Grafton Group, the same company that owns both Grafton Street Pub and Grill and Russell House Tavern, will open up on Dunster Street across from the Smith Campus Center in the former Kennedy’s on the Square location. However, Jillson expressed concern that the Campus Center’s current heavy construction might deter potential customers from frequenting the new eatery.
Just a couple of blocks away at 8 Holyoke St., Mediterranean-style wine bar En Boca will move into the location previously occupied by Sandrine’s. An Italian restaurant owned by chef Michael Pagliarini—who also owns Italian restaurant Giulia—is set to open in the Charles Hotel.
DAVIDsTEA will open its first Cambridge location on JFK Street next to Sweetgreen, an East Coast-based salad chain. Sweetgreen, originally slated for a summer opening, will most likely open up by the end of the year, according to Jillson.
Although many students are still reeling from the closure of Panera earlier this year, Tatte Bakery and Cafe, which Panera has invested in, will open up in Panera’s former location in late September, according to Tatte’s catering manager Sarah Hang.
“We are very excited to be joining Harvard Square. It’s such a lively area,” Hang said.
However there are also several Harvard Square establishments that students will no longer see as they reacquaint themselves with the Square.
The Sound Lion audio store is among the businesses that have shut their doors. A couple of storefronts away, the Tannery clothing and shoe boutique has also closed its doors. The reason for the closure is unclear, and the business did not respond to a request for comment.
“I’ve heard different reports that they might relocate in the Square or close permanently,” Jillson said.
The Concepts sportswear store, also on Brattle Street, will relocate to 9 JFK St, according to a recent tweet from the company.

The National Labor Relations Board's decision to grant teaching assistants at private universities employee status with collective bargaining rights has sparked a variety of reactions at Harvard, as classes begin and the prospect of a union election looms.
On Monday, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng sent an email to graduate students updating them on the recent developments, noting that the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers could now call for a union election. Meng wrote that the University “has invited the HGSU-UAW to meet and discuss next steps in light of the NLRB’s decision.”
Yale’s graduate student unionization effort has already petitioned the NLRB, and is seeking to have departments file for elections individually. This approach differs from the previous filing practices of union movements at other universities.
“The decision to form a labor union is a serious one and I look forward to joining you in a robust dialogue,” Meng wrote.
As of February, at least 60 percent of the nearly 4,000 graduate  students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who are employed by Harvard as teaching fellows or research assistants had signed an authorization card in support of the HGSU-UAW. Union organizers celebrated last week’s landmark decision to recognize graduate students as workers with collective bargaining rights as an important victory for the movement.
Students not involved in the union effort also expressed excitement. Philosophy Ph.D. student James F. Bondarchuk, who has signed an authorization card, said, “I think it’s great. I think it’s a very positive development for graduate students.”
Bondarchuk said he does not believe a union would affect his relationship with his advisers and professors, a claim which remains one of the University’s chief arguments against unionization and a topic of concern among some students.
“Your adviser is not directly and personally profiting from your being paid. The incentive structure in the adviser-advisee relationship is very different from in a traditional employer-employee relationship,” Bondarchuk said.
When asked if he would also vote in support of the HGSU-UAW in the coming election, he responded that he would “without hesitation.”
Sociology Ph.D. student Charlotte Lloyd, who is not actively involved in the unionization effort, was also pleased by the NLRB decision. She intends to vote in support of the HGSU-UAW in an election.
“Proper recognition of graduate student labor and the protections that recognition entails are overdue and ultimately beneficial to the university community,” Lloyd wrote in an email. “Hopefully the union will be a positive forum for discussion of graduate student labor issues.”
But some graduate students are not as convinced. While Kevin Tian, a Ph.D. student in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, acknowledges that unions in general have been beneficial for improving working conditions, he has doubts about their efficacy in a university setting.
“To me it’s not immediately obvious whether a union for the engineering students would make sense,” Tian said. “Students at SEAS, for example, only have to teach once. One semester, one section. So it’s a significantly reduced load in terms of how much we serve as a teaching assistant compared to research assistantship.”
“It seems a lot of things are so department-specific, I’m not sure how [the union] would address that,” Tian added.
In addition to student research assistants and teaching fellows, undergraduate teaching assistants could be part of a union as well. The debate over unionization has been mostly confined to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and other graduate schools, but it could potentially spill over into the College.
James Lim ’16, a former Crimson sports editor, who was a teaching fellow for an intermediate macroeconomics course for three years as an undergraduate, said the undergraduate and graduate student teaching fellows performed the same work.
“My day-to-day was no different than that of the graduate students who are also TFs,” Lin said. “We also prepare teaching materials and taught sections every week.”
However, Lin said he considered the experience to be an enriching part-time job.
“Is it something we would have demanded union rights for? I’m not sure about that,” Lin said. “I don’t think that any undergraduate teaching fellows jumped into the class thinking that this was going to be a job per se.”
Gabriel G. Hodgkin ’18 expressed his support for the broad category of workers that includes undergraduates. Hodgkin is a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate group that advocates for worker rights.
“I’m excited that the NLRB definition includes so many of the people whose work makes our community run, and it’s important that we all be able to join together to make Harvard a healthier place,” Hodgkin said.
He added that he is excited about what the decision will mean for graduate students.
“Grad students have quite an important role in my education. I’ve seen firsthand the work they do and I know that the grad students’ working conditions are the undergraduates’ learning conditions,” Hodgkin said. “We’re all in this together.”
Tian said he thinks the discussion surrounding unionization will get more serious in the coming weeks, in light of the decision. There is not a clear cut majority of students for or against the union effort in SEAS, he added.
“The discussion is going to be happening a lot more openly because it is considered now an option that there will be an actual election, as opposed to before where it was kind of a very vague hypothetical,” he said.

With wide-eyed freshmen seated in Tercentenary Theatre for their convocation ceremony, prominent Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, challenged the new students to make the most of their nascent college careers and pursue truth in the midst of what she considered toxic public discourse.
The Tuesday afternoon ceremony, which takes place at the beginning of every academic year, welcomes freshmen to campus and features a series of student and faculty speakers.
In her address, Faust decried “the vile discourse of ethnic, religious, and racial hatred that has spread with such active virulence in recent months,” cautioning students that the mission of a research university—pursuing truth—has become all the more urgent. 
“At a time when we find ourselves in what pundits have dubbed a ‘post-factual world,’ universities must embrace, embody, and actively defend their very different standards of truth: their commitment to evidence, proof, and fact as the foundation for knowledge and the basis for action in the world,” Faust said.
This “wild rumpus of ideas,” Faust said, must be coupled with a respectful and inclusive attitude. “We need to feel safe enough, included enough, understood enough to dare to disagree,” Faust said.
Beginning with a prayer from Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church, the list of speakers included Faust, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and Emma Woo ’17. 
Retreading a number of his favorite credos, Khurana entreated the Class of 2020 to make their time at the College a “transformative,” not “transactional,” experience. Instead of checking boxes and using Harvard as a simple platform to successful careers, Khurana implored the students to be idealistic and think about ways to better the world and the University.
“Right now probably some of you think Harvard is awesome. Harvard is awesome!” Khurana said. “But it isn’t perfect. It’s not the culmination of some evolutionary apex in higher education. Harvard is imperfect because humans are imperfect, and our ideals are not easily realized.”
Between performances from the Harvard Choruses, the Kuumba Singers, and the Harvard University Band, several other speakers took to the tree-shaded stage. Like Khurana, Smith revisited familiar themes in his address, stressing that everyone is vulnerable to insecurities and jealousy before advising the freshmen: “Don’t compare, connect.” Woo, the president of the Harvard College Interfaith Forum, mused about the plurality of ideas she has encountered in college.
After the program, the freshmen—assembled in full for the only time besides their commencement in 2020—flooded Widener Library's steps for their customary class photo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: OCTOBER 3, 2016
Last Friday, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker released the team’s 2016-2017 schedule. Despite a non-conference schedule reminiscent of years past, the team will kick off this season in unfamiliar fashion. Following its annual home matchup with MIT on Nov. 3, the Crimson heads to Shanghai on Nov. 11 to face off against Stanford in the second annual Pac-12 China Game. Both teams enter the contest coming off lackluster seasons that saw the Crimson finish fourth in the Ivy League and Stanford ninth in the Pac-12.
After the trip overseas, Harvard heads back to Cambridge where it will face a familiar slate of regional opponents in Holy Cross, Massachusetts, Northeastern, and Boston College—all four of which handed the Crimson a loss the past season. The Crimson also take on NAIA’s Fisher College on Nov. 17.
Back on Harvard’s regional slate after a two-year absence is Fordham, which the Crimson face off against on Dec. 3 at Lavietes Pavilion. Also on Harvard’s non-conference schedule is a trip to Houston on Dec. 23. The two last met in 2014 when the Crimson handed the Cougars an 84-63 loss.
Notably absent from this year’s schedule is an in-season tournament. In last year’s Diamond Head Classic, Harvard finished as an unexpected runner-up to Oklahoma following an 83-71 loss in the title game. The Crimson also captured titles in the 2011 Battle 4 Atlantis tournament and the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout two years later. Ivy League teams are only able to participate in two in-season tournaments every four years.
Following the holidays, Harvard faces off against another familiar foe in Howard on Dec. 30 at Lavietes Pavilion. In a historical matchup over Martin Luther King Day weekend last year, the Crimson topped the Bison, 69-61. Harvard caps off its nonconference schedule with a trip to Vermont on Jan. 2, a home game against McGill on Jan. 10, and an away showdown with Bryant on Jan. 16. The Crimson faced off against all three squads last season, coming away with wins against McGill and Bryant, but dropping its matchup with the Catamounts, 65-62.
At the end of the nonconference season the Crimson faces an equally familiar conference slate, chock full of weekend back-to-backs. The Crimson starts off Ivy League competition with a game against Dartmouth on Jan. 7. After facing Dartmouth again at home two weeks later, Harvard heads to New York to take on Columbia and Cornell on Jan. 27 and 28. Harvard takes on Penn and Princeton in Cambridge over Super Bowl weekend before traveling to Brown and defending league champion Yale.
Following a late-season four game home stand against the Bulldogs, Bears, and Killer C’s the Crimson closes out its regular season with a trip to Princeton and Penn. New to the Ivy League this season is a four-team conference tournament for the league title, to be held March 11 and 12 in Philadelphia.
