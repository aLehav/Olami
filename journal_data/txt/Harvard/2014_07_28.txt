After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MADRID—Living here this summer has taught me that I’m a bad kisser.
No, I have not gotten in touch with my promiscuous side whilst overseas. But while I’ve accepted most of Spanish culture with relative ease—learning to mentally convert euros to dollars and kilometers to miles, to survive without peanut butter, and to not get hungry for dinner until nine or ten in the evening — my attempts to navigate the double-kiss-in-lieu-of-handshake that Spaniards use to greet one another have been nothing but an awkward and embarrassing struggle.
People say hello here via a quick peck on each cheek. This practice, I’ve learned, is not just a way to greet close friends, but is an all-but-mandatory method for addressing pretty much anyone. And though I’ve managed to get the hang of finding my way around the city, the work required for my internship, and how many tapas to order to make up a full dinner, I have yet to properly learn exactly how or when to initiate the double kiss.
On more than one occasion, I have misread the signals and gone in for either a hug or a handshake. Even when I do read the situation correctly, I struggle. I’m fairly certain that my lips aren’t actually supposed to make contact with the other person’s cheeks, and so I devote an excessive amount of mental concentration toward ensuring I aim properly and only kiss the air. I’m also continually unsure of where to appropriately place my hands, and in a misguided attempt to avoid uncomfortably caressing a stranger, I tend to just lean forward with my arms stuck straight out to the sides, like a bird that can’t quite balance right.
I also lack the confidence to initiate the greeting. Since kissing strangers is such a foreign concept to me, I doubt myself and have trouble believing that the practice is truly appropriate, particularly when meeting people at work. My solution has been to wait for my new acquaintance to initiate the double-kiss, which results in a couple seconds of uncomfortable eye contact after I am introduced to someone as I wait nervously and I can only imagine appear either rudely aloof or incredibly awkward.
Who knew that the simplest of cultural differences would give me so much trouble?
Sprinkled with government buildings, embassies, and traffic circles featuring impressive statues and fountains, my home in Spain’s capital city is not too far a cry from my hometown near our capital city back in the U.S. (they even call the subway here the Metro!) After over a month living here, Madrid definitely feels comfortable and familiar.
But still, I miss handshakes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days after Harvard announced sweeping, University-wide changes to its sexual assault policies and resolution procedures, student leaders and activists said that while the approve of many of the policy’s changes, they are dismayed that they did not establish a more expansive definition of sexual assault.
The changes included the creation of a new university-wide Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution to investigate sexual assault allegations and a “preponderance of the evidence” standard to investigate them. The policy uses a standard of “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” to define sexual harassment, rather than a standard of affirmative consent, as some of Harvard’s peer institutions use.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 called the newly announced policies a “step in the right direction” in an interview on July 3, but criticized their failure to include an affirmative consent requirement.
Affirmative consent is a standard that requires both partners to actively communicate their willingness to participate in sexual activity. The Undergraduate Council voted to endorse such a clause in November 2012.
“I really do think that having [an affirmative consent] policy is an important step to changing culture on campus—to making affirmative consent a social norm,” UC vice president Sietse K. Goffard ’15 added, arguing that such a policy on campus would work to prevent sexual assault, rather than just react to it.
Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an incoming leader of the student advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, which has vocally argued for reform of Harvard’s sexual assault policies, said she applauds the changes the University has made to the complaint process by creating a new investigative office with a more standardized and streamlined process.
However, like the UC leaders, she said that she is still concerned by the use of a standard of “welcomeness and unwelcomeness” to define consent in cases of sexual assault.
“[The new standard is] very vague and dilutes the sense...that they are very specific acts of violence and power and determination,” Fournier said. “A policy of affirmative of consent will allow survivors to better understand their own circumstances...and define what happened to them.”
Fournier argued that the new “unwelcome conduct” standard is ambiguous and that an affirmative consent standard would be more clearly defined.
For Fournier, an affirmative consent clause would “make communication paramount,” prevent those incapacitated from giving consent, and not equate a longstanding relationship to consent.
Mia Karvonides, Harvard’s Title IX officer who will play a central role in implementing the new policies, said July 2 in a question-and-answer with the Harvard Gazette—a publication of Harvard’s communications office—that the new policies do not include an affirmative consent policy because “there is no standard definition of affirmative consent.”
“The closest any college comes to a defined affirmative-consent approach is Antioch College,” Karvonides said. “Under their policy, consent is given step by step at every point of engagement during an intimate encounter. You must verbally ask and verbally get an answer for every point of engagement. ‘May I kiss you? May I undo your blouse?’ Etc.”
Still, other universities, such as Yale and Dartmouth, have adopted sexual assault policies that include affirmative consent clauses, with varying definitions.
Mayopoulos and Goffard said that Karvonides’s defense of the decision not to adopt an affirmative consent policy was unsatisfactory.
“There is no perfect, one accepted standard, but the fact is that there should be … a Harvard definition that is most suitable to our campus,” Goffard added.
Alison Shafer, the incoming president of Harvard Law School’s student representative council, took a different approach to the policies, with praise for the changes but noting that implementation of the policy is key to its success.
“It ultimately comes down to how the policy is implemented,” Sher said, citing the op-ed “Dear Harvard, You Win,” which accused the administration of mishandling previous sexual assault cases.
Sher declined to comment on the new policy's standard of preponderance of evidence and its exclusion of an affirmative consent clause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s and women’s soccer teams will not be in action for another month, there certainly has not been a shortage of excitement at Ohiri Field this week.
Liverpool Football Club, one of the top teams in the English Premier League, arrived in Boston Monday to kick off its summer tour of the United States. And for the second time in the last three years, the Reds elected to practice at Harvard over the course of their stay.
For much of the week, Liverpool ran both morning and afternoon training sessions at Ohiri. Hundreds of fans lined the gates each day, and many were even treated to autographs and photo opportunities with some of the Reds, including star midfielder Steven Gerrard and forward Daniel Sturridge.
Over the past few years, Liverpool has developed strong ties to the Boston area. In October 2010, the club was sold to Fenway Sports Group, the sports investment company that owns the Boston Red Sox. Since then, John Henry, the owner of the two squads, has been working to generate support for the Reds in Massachusetts.
One of Henry’s initiatives was to bring his new club to the home of his old one. He helped establish the “Football at Fenway” series in 2010 and brought Liverpool to the ballpark for its Boston debut in 2012. The Reds took on A.S. Roma, an Italian Serie A Club, under the lights of Fenway in front of a sold-out crowd of 37,169 fans.
This year, Liverpool opened its American Tour with a rematch against Roma at Fenway Park on July 23. With most of their starters on the bench, the Reds fell, 1-0, but they will have several more chances to pick up a win during their stay in the States. The club plays next at Soldier Field in Chicago Sunday against Olympiacos. Henry’s team will also take on Manchester City at Yankee Stadium and A.C. Milan in North Carolina before heading back to Anfield.
Prior to leaving for Chicago, however, the Reds decided to give back to the city of Boston. In addition to running their own practices at Harvard, several Liverpool coaches conducted a free soccer clinic for kids from Allston-Brighton, Boston, Cambridge, and Watertown last Sunday at Soldiers Field.
Liverpool kicks off its regular season August 17 against Southampton. After finishing second last season, the Reds will be looking for their first Premier League title since 1990.
