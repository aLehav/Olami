After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The snowfall was still fresh as I walked through New Hampshire, knocking on doors before the Democratic Primary in February. My canvassing partner was a Colombian born student who started his studies abroad, but decided to finish his education in the U.S., now participating as an active member of the Harvard College Democrats.
In an election that has contested what it fundamentally means to be American, the afternoon was more than simple civic duty. It felt more like an attempt to survive in and protect the America that insists it is for all, including us—two Latino men with immigrant backgrounds.
This election’s anti-immigrant sentiments and xenophobia have been terrifying. The Republican nominee, Donald Trump, kicked off his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists and criminals. Then, when the move gained him political points, he continued the rhetoric. He questioned Judge Curiel’s ability to uphold the law because of his Mexican heritage, although Curiel was born in Indiana and is as American as Trump himself. And, in a pitiful attempt to save his image, he posted a picture of himself saying he loved Hispanics, the only evidence being a taco bowl.
Donald Trump has made a successful campaign out of questioning American multiculturalism, making Latino individuals question if they have a space in today’s America. The American Dream brought our families here, but who is allowed to dream is questionable after this election. By attacking both undocumented Latinos and Latinos with birthright citizenship, it seems incomprehensible that there would be any Latinos for Trump.
But looking at Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party reveals that there would be understandable reason for more Latinos to support the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton has pandered by claiming that she is like my abuela—which she sure as hell isn’t. Her interventionism as Secretary of State has led to turmoil in Honduras, and she's in large part responsible for the influx of unaccompanied Central American children to the United States.
To top things all off, leaked e-mails from the DNC refer to Latinos as nothing more than a “brand” to be “acquired” — as if a whole community of Americans is nothing more than a collection of votes on the way to the presidency. This mythologized Latino monolith continues to erase the fact that the political, cultural, and social realities of Latinos in the United States are wildly diverse.
The political system will only work for those who are present, and Latinos have been missing from the important roles that sustain our democracy. Only six percent of the members of Congress are Hispanic. There are only three Latino senators in office. There are far fewer Hispanics eligible to vote in the first place, and those who are eligible to vote have lower turnout rates as well. This disengagement is not always conscious. Poverty and inflexible working-class job schedules are known to deter individuals from voting and being involved in the political system, and Latinos are more likely to find themselves in these situations. When Election Day becomes a choice between taking time to support a party that sees you as no more than a vote or working another hour to put food on the table, the choice is clear.
There is no way of getting the representation this country needs without helping those who have no entrance into the process. Starting at the local level, programs need to be set that build these bridges into the system. Predominantly Latino high schools could offer after school sessions on voting and community organizing for students who don’t hear about how to get involved while at home. The possibilities are endless, but it is essential that political systems on the local, state, and federal level take steps to include all Americans as more than just a voting bloc.
Democracy should work for all, not just those who can afford to be involved. When more of the most influential political seats are held by Latinos, there can be an accurate, diverse understanding of what it means to be Latino—and, in turn, an accurate representation of the political spectrum of the “Latino voter.” The assumed allegiance to a certain party will finally disappear, and politicians and their parties will finally have to face the reality that latinidad encompasses conservatives, liberals, and everyone in between.
This election season, the idea of Latinos for Trump may seem ridiculous, but the way limited representation has led to polarizing political parties for Latino voters, touting Latinos for Romney or McCain still seems bizarre. As much as we may disagree with the policies of those across the aisle, democracy works best with differing opinions. When Latinos are granted equal access into the process, these perspectives can thrive and both parties can begin to see us as not just Latinos for Trump, or Latinos for Clinton, but rather Latinos for Democracy and Latinos for America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has unveiled a new addition to its HarvardX virtual education platform, which will for the first time charge between about $200 and $500 for enrollment in online courses, signaling a move towards more financially sustainable online learning models.
Starting in September, the paid program, HarvardXPlus, will offer four eight-week courses, a departure from HarvardX’s current online course offerings, which are open to auditors—people who can view lectures and materials online but do not receive course credit—for free.
HarvardXPlus promises students expanded content and more intimate contact with peers, teaching fellows, and faculty. In addition, the program will also provide those who complete the course with a “branded credential,” a two-page document that describes in detail the the learning objectives, outcomes, and skills acquired during the course. Enrollment will be capped in the hundreds, as opposed to tens of thousands who enroll in HarvardX courses.
Three of the courses—biochemistry, business contracts, and world literature—come with a $495 price tag. The final course, ChinaX Book Club, costs $195.
While HarvardXPlus is the first program in HarvardX to require a fee for enrollment, HarvardX allows participants to purchase a verified certificates in otherwise free courses. These certificates typically cost between $50 and $150.
Faculty director of HarvardX Robert A. Lue said that charging a fee will provide financial incentive to finish the course. According to a recent report, 5 percent of non-paying HarvardX participants completed the course, while those who paid for certification had around a 59 percent completion rate. Lue said he hopes these courses will have a more committed cohort of participants.
“We are able to bring together a community that is hard to bring together physically. [HarvardXPlus] is a limited enrollment group which is from all around the world. It’s an opportunity to have a conversation that is so diverse and so different, but they’re all committed to an intimate, intensive experience,” Lue said. 
The move to a paid addition to HarvardX’s entirely free online catalogue symbolizes a slight departure from the norm of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, which are open to auditors for free.
“I think it’s important not to look at it as Harvard turning its back on MOOCs. It’s looking at it as a new learning opportunity which will provide additional value but will cost a little more than traditional MOOCs,” said Ray Schroeder, associate vice chancellor for online learning at the University of Illinois.
In 2012 Harvard and MIT unveiled edX, an online learning hub that hosts the HarvardX platform. The move was in part why 2012 was dubbed “the year of the MOOC” and many felt that edX had the capacity to revolutionize education. In the years since, over 50 other universities have signed on to create classes for edX.
However, the online education platform has not been without its issues. HarvardX has yet to take hold as an integral part of Harvard’s on-campus learning environment. The fiscal sustainability of the program has also come under question.
Lue said he hopes the additional revenue from HarvardXPlus will contribute to the sustainability of HarvardX and defray some of the costs of producing the online materials. Still, Lue stressed that the premium model was something that has always been planned and that it likely would have come to fruition regardless of the added benefit of additional revenue.
“Like a lot of things in sustainability, there are a lot of things which go into it. It’s a portfolio approach. Do I think this will be part of the portfolio? I hope so,” said Lue.
Lue emphasized that HarvardXPlus is “experimental,” and more premium courses are currently in the works. According to Lue, HarvardX will evaluate the first iteration of the program after the courses are completed this fall.
“Ultimately the world of online learning is moving so fast so we are still learning what we can do,” Lue said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
George Q. Daley ’82, a pioneering stem cell researcher and long-serving professor at Harvard Medical School, will lead the school as its next dean, ending a prolonged and at times contested search to fill the position.
Daley will take over from acting dean Barbara J. McNeil starting in January 2017, according to a press release from the University. McNeil has occupied the role since Aug. 1, following the resignation of Jeffrey S. Flier after nine years at the school’s helm.
A Leverett House alumnus, Daley is a professor of biological chemistry, molecular pharmacology, and pediatrics at the Medical School and a prominent stem cell scientist, currently heading the Stem Cell Transplantation Program at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. After earning a Ph.D. from MIT and M.D. from the Medical School, Daley became a chief resident at Massachusetts General Hospital. He joined the Harvard faculty as an assistant professor in 1995 and became a full professor in 2010.
“George Daley is an eminent scientist, a dedicated educator, an adept bridge-builder, a compelling advocate for scientific discovery, and a person of remarkable leadership qualities and thoughtful judgment,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release announcing Daley’s appointment.
Daley’s appointment comes after some Medical and Dental School students decried what they considered  a lack of diversity in Longwood, where their campuses are located. In February, around 40 students representing the Racial Justice Coalition student group delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall, where Faust works, demanding that Harvard select a dean who “has demonstrated a commitment to social justice,” as well as make an effort to interview candidates from “backgrounds underrepresented in medicine.”
Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 did not explicitly address the concerns of the group in the press release, but offered thanks “to the many people across the Harvard medical community who offered their perspectives and counsel on the deanship.”
During the search process, Faust and Garber solicited suggestions from Medical  School affiliates. In February, Faust appointed Michelle A. Williams as the first black dean of a Harvard faculty to lead the  School of Public Health.
As dean, Daley will oversee the Medical School as it allocates its portion of the University’s record-breaking $6.5 billion capital campaign; as of April, the Medical School had raised just over 70 percent of its $750 million goal. With $150 million earmarked for educational initiatives, the Medical School rolled out a new curriculum in 2015 based on a “flipped classroom” model.
“I feel humbled by the prospect of leading so talented a community with so essential a mission — a community whose dynamism, growing diversity, and shared concern for the well-being of others are a deep source of strength,” Daley said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 11, 2016, at 11:30 a.m.
This week, graduates of the Fox Club could reverse a historic undergraduate move that last year controversially added women to the 118-year old club.
At a Thursday morning special meeting, Fox club graduates will vote on two resolutions: whether to “allow undergraduate members to punch and elect female members in the 2016-2017 school year and beyond” and whether to allow undergraduates to extend “provisional” memberships granted to female and many male undergraduates until the summer of 2017, according to a copy of the ballot that was obtained by The Crimson.
Although extending provisional memberships requires only a simple majority to pass, changing the club’s “nature or character” by allowing female members requires a two-thirds majority.
The vote is almost sure to inflame tensions further among Fox club members, who have spent the past year at loggerheads over the role of women at the club, the bounds of undergraduate members’ power, and the proper response to administrative pressures.
While the co-ed question will remain undecided until Thursday, an internal survey conducted by the Fox club’s Path Forward Steering Committee, a body formed in the wake of intense internal controversy at the club, bears bleak news for those in favor of a co-ed or gender neutral Fox club.
Earlier this year, the committee distributed a wide-ranging survey to 867 Fox club graduates and 72 undergraduate members, with an ultimate response rate of 49 percent among graduates and 75 percent among undergraduates, according to results obtained by The Crimson.
Just over half, or 51 percent, of surveyed graduate members said they supported “making the club open to women on the same basis as men,” well short of the two-thirds majority needed. In contrast, 83 percent of polled undergraduate members, who will not participate in Thursday’s vote, support opening the club to women.
The survey did not query members on how they would vote on the question of extending provisional members. Last October, in an attempt to quell graduate opposition to the co-ed move, many female and male Fox initiates accepted temporary memberships into the club, pending a future graduate vote. Given that extending the provisional membership for a year requires only a simple majority though, the prospect looks brighter for undergraduates on that front.
Still, the survey figures, should they hold, could represent a disappointment for the club’s graduates and undergraduates who advocated for female members. A return to purely all-male membership policies at the Fox would also cast a pall on extensive efforts from College administrators to compel single-gender groups to embrace a wider membership pool, efforts that culminated last academic year with the announcement of unprecedented sanctions on single-gender social organizations.
Fox graduate board president Hugh M. Nesbit ’77 and Fox undergraduate President Ian P. Meyer '17 did not respond to request for comment for this story.
In addition to its projection about the future of women at the Fox, the survey highlights a persistent sticking point of final club life: the seemingly-unavoidable tension between the graduate membership, who control the clubs’ legal, financial, and physical infrastructure, and the undergraduates who regularly enjoy the benefits of the clubs’ deep coffers and plum real estate.
While the Fox is deeply divided on the question of female members, the survey laid bare a host of other issues on which the opinion of undergraduates and graduates differ.
Despite agreement on what the report called “key elements” of the club’s purpose—over 75 percent of undergraduate and graduate respondents agreed that “Friendship” and “Camaraderie” were important elements of Fox Club life—graduates and undergraduate survey respondents logged significant differences on issues ranging from the purpose of the clubhouse, to the Fox’s place in the broader undergraduate community, to trust in University administrators.
Undergraduate respondents, for instance, were far more likely to think the club should be a part of Harvard’s broader social milieu—49 percent of them strongly agreed with the statement that the Fox “should contribute to the social life of the broader undergraduate community. Only 15 percent of graduates expressed strong agreement with the same statement.
This difference is also reflected in views towards the proper use of the club’s 44 JFK Street clubhouse, which the Fox’s graduate board briefly shuttered last year as a result of continuing strife between graduates and undergraduates. Just four percent of undergraduates expressed agreement with the prompt that “the Clubhouse should be a members-only facility” closed to parties, date events, and other larger social functions. Roughly a third of graduates strongly agreed with the statement.
While University administration was not well-regarded among respondents—perhaps no surprise for a club whose undergraduates claimed that administrators “forced [their] hand” in making the decision to add women to the club—undergraduate respondents were more than three times more confident than graduate ones that the club would be “treated fairly” by the University: 28 percent to 9 percent, respectively.
There was broad support among respondents of all stripes for an independent Fox Club, with 90 percent of graduate and 80 percent of undergraduate respondents registering strong support to remain “fully independent” from Harvard.
The survey also gauged how a co-ed move might affect the Fox Club’s finances, with the available data suggesting that "if the Club goes co-ed, annual giving will decrease; if the Club remains all male, annual giving will increase."
Running a final club is not cheap. Costs for date and punch events, property upkeep, insurance, and property taxes on multi-million dollar clubhouses require huge amounts of annual spending, often significantly more than clubs collect in membership dues from their undergraduates.
In the 2014 fiscal year, for instance, club records indicate total expenses at the Fox exceeded $200,000, with the undergraduates cost share coming to roughly $28,000. According to the survey results, the bulk of the tab is picked up by alumni who graduated from Harvard over 30 years ago.

Nikki Okwelogu
Women’s Track and Field: Shotput, Nigeria
For the second straight Olympic games, the Harvard track and field program will field an athlete to represent the Crimson. Four years after Samyr Laine ’06 represented Haiti in the long jump at the 2012 London edition, rising senior Nikki Okwelogu will step up for Nigeria in the shot put.
Okwelogu’s appearance in Rio is a culmination of the success she has had over the past few years in honing her talents.
The Fresno, Calif. native came to Harvard as a highly sought after recruit coming out of Clovis West High School, amassing over 80 offers from collegiate track programs before selecting the Crimson.
It took little time for Okwelogu to make an impact upon joining the Crimson, as the then-freshman took home both the indoor and outdoor Ivy league titles in the shot put while also recording school records in discus and shot put.
The shot putter’s first taste in international competition came the following summer, as Okwelogu elected to represent Nigeria–the country her parents were born in–on the international stage. Okwelogu continue her success by taking home the Nigerian National Championship in the shot put and finishing as runner-up at the African Championships in the same event a few weeks later.
Okwelogu also partook in the Commonwealth Games, competing against a stacked field that included defending Olympic champion Valerie Adams of New Zealand. The prestigious event was the first taste of high-caliber competition the Crimson athlete obtained and provided somewhat of a comparison magnitude-wise to the Olympics.
“It’s literally like an Olympic games, an opening ceremony and fans everywhere,” Okwelogu said in 2014. “I had no idea until I walked into the stadium, and I was supposed to be warming up, but I was just looking around for a solid five minutes.”
Okwelogu’s international experience quickly paid dividends as the then-sophomore took home the Ancient Eight titles in both the discus and shot put, consistently breaking the conference record and named a first team All-American at the NCAA Indoor Championships in the latter.
In her junior year campaign with the Crimson, Okwelogu took home yet another quartet of Ivy League titles and was named first team outdoor All-American and second-team outdoor All-American in the shot put and discus, respectively. Most importantly, however, the shot putter made sure her Olympic dream became achievable.
Okwelogu reached the Olympic qualifying standard at the NCAA Eastern Regional Championships, throwing a personal best mark of 17.91 meters to take home the event title.
The Harvard athlete was named to the Nigerian Olympic team in the shot put after taking home second place at the African Championships with a 17.07 throw; the rising senior also took home the title in discus, throwing a mark of 56.75 meters.
Though Okwelogu has shown success at a variety of levels so far, the shot putter will have her work cut out for her in Rio. In the 2012 London games, the gold medal winning throw by Adams was 20.70 meters, more than two meters longer than Okwelogu’s career best. The rising senior’s all-time best would have been the 17th best mark at the first round of the 2012 Olympics and over half-a-meter short of the top 11 marks that moved on to the event finals.

Vincent Breet
Men’s Heavyweight Crew: Coxless Four Boat, South Africa
One of just three current undergraduates who will be representing the Crimson in Rio de Janeiro this summer, rising senior Vincent Breet will be part of the South African Coxless Four Boat looking to take home the gold medal.
Breet is no stranger to international competition, racking up years of experience competing for South Africa before suiting up for the Crimson. The South African decided to take the past year off prior to the Olympics to focus all his attention on training in his homeland.
The Alberton, South Africa native began representing his home country at the 2012 World rowing Junior Championships, competing with the coxed four boat that took 10th place overall.
The 2010 competition was the first of a steady stream of apperances in the South African boat for Breet, who transitioned to pair rowing at the 2011 World Junior Championships, taking home sixth place overall.
After placing second overall in the Men’s Pair at the U23 World Rowing Championships in 2012, Breet made his World Rowing Cup debut at the 2013 edition in Lucerne, Switzerland, clocking the fourth fastest time in the Men’s Pair final. The rising senior also took home the 2013 U23 World Rowing Championship Men’s Pair title just a few weeks later before joining the Crimson.
Breet’s impact was immediate for Harvard, as the then-freshman–the first ever first year to row with the Varsity team–rowed fifth seat on the first Varsity Eight all season, helping them take home second place at the IRA National Championships.
The South African’s international achievements continued to grow, as Breet advanced to the finals of the Henley Royal Regatta in a pair while representing Tuks Rowing Club in the 2014 summer. The Harvard athlete also made his first appearance at the World Rowing Championships, taking home the bronze medal in the Men’s Pair to go along with a fifth place finish in the same event at the World Rowing Cup.
Just a year later–after once again rowing the fifth seat in the first Varsity Eight for Harvard in his sophomore year–Breet moved to the men’s four, taking home the C final at the 2015 World Rowing Championships and competing at the 2015 Rowing World Cup. It’s in this event that Breet will compete in after helping South Africa take sixth in the 2016 World Rowing Cup and first at the 2016 FISA European and Final Olympic Qualification Regatta.
Breet and the South African boat will start competition in Rio on August 8 in Heat 3, competing against Greece, France, and powerhouse Great Britain in their quest for an Olympic medal.

Henrik Rummel ‘09
Men’s Heavyweight Crew: Coxless Four Boat, USA
Despite being born in Copenhagen, Denmark, Harvard grad Henrik Rummel ’09 will find himself donning the USA colors for the second times at the Olympics when he competes in Rio as part of the men’s Coxless Four Boat, but Rummel is no stranger to representing the Stars and Stripes.
After moving to the United States in 2000, it took only four years for the Copenhagen native to be chosen as a representative for the US at the international level. Rummel competed in both 2004 and 2005 as part of the men’s eight at the World Junior Rowing Championships. After taking fifth in 2004, Rummel helped the United States take home the title in 2005.
Soon after, Rummel joined the Crimson, helping the freshman eight take third place at the EARC sprints and fifth at the IRA National Championships in 2006. The next year, the then-sophomore transitioned to the first Varsity Eight, helping the team take second place at the IRA National Championships and the Ladies Plate Challenge at the Henley Royal Regatta while garnering first-team All-Ivy honors.
After his junior campaign with Harvard, Rummel returned to the international stage, representing the USA at the U23 World Rowing Championships, helping the US take home first place in the men’s eight.
After finishing his collegiate career undefeated in the varsity eight in the comfort of the Charles River, Rummel began his prolific international career with the US by taking seventh in the men’s eight at the 2009 World Rowing Cup and first in the men’s pair with coxswain at the 2009 World Rowing Championships.
Rummel continued in 2010 by finishing fifth in the men’s four at the World Rowing Championships before being a Grand Challenge Cup semifinalist at the 2011 Henley, fourth in the men’s eight at the 2011 World Rowing Cup, and eighth in the men’s eight at World Rowing Championships.
Four consecutive years of international competition with the US culminated in Rummel’s first ever Olympic appearance at the 2012 London games, where he helped the US men’s four take home the bronze medal.
Since London, Rummel has established himself as a stalwart in the men’s four for the US, taking home third and first at the 2013 World Rowing Championships and World Rowing Cup, respectively. In 2014, Rummel led the US to second and third at the World Rowing Championships and World Rowing Cup before returning to his winning ways in the 2015 edition of the World Rowing Cup.
Rummel and the US defended their title this year at the World Rowing Cup I and took fourth at the World Rowing Cup II leading up to the 2016 Rio Olympics, where they will begin their quest for another medal against Belarus, Canada, and Italy in Heat 2.

Michael DiSanto ‘12
Men’s Heavyweight Crew: Men’s Eight, USA
Boston will be able to claim one of its own as a member of the USA Men’s Eight boat competing at Rio this summer thanks to Harvard grad Michael DiSanto ’12.
An Economics major who captained the Crimson before graduating in 2012, the Boston native was a pivotal component of three consecutive top-five finishes at the IRA National Championships during his time in Cambridge.
DiSanto made an early impact for Harvard as part of the freshman eight that went undefeated in dual racing in 2009 before moving on to become part of the first Varsity Eight as a sophomore. The then-sophomore encountered immediate success upon joining the Varsity boat, helping the Crimson take home the Eastern Sprints, EARC, and Ivy League title as well the program’s seventh Ladies Challenge Plate at the prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.
The success continued during DiSanto’s junior year with Harvard despite the team falling short of defending its Ladies Challenge Plate title at the 2011 rendition of the Henley. The Crimson once again took home the EARC, Eastern, and Ancient Eight titles as well as finishing runner-up to the University of Washington at the IRA National Championships.
After his successful campaign with Harvard, DiSanto suited up for US Rowing for the first time, competing in the men’s four at the U23 World Rowing Championships. The Boston native finished in sixth place in his first taste of international competition.
In his last season with the Crimson, DiSanto captained the Crimson to another Ladies Challenge Plate at the Henley as well as a perfect dual season and a third place finish at the IRA National Championship.
It took a year after graduating from Harvard before DiSanto donned the US uniform at the international level once again, as the rower represented USA at the 2013 World Rowing Championships. Competing in the men’s pair, DiSanto finished 14th overall.
Two years later, DiSanto improved on his previous performance, taking ninth place in the men’s pair at the 2015 World Rowing Championships before transitioning to the men’s eight for the 2016 international competitions.
DiSanto was part of the US boat that took first place at the Olympic Qualification Regatta and helped his country finish third at the World Rowing Cup a few weeks later. The US men’s eight will open up competition in Heat 2 of the event, competing against Germany and Poland.

Andrew Campbell Jr. ‘14
Men’s Lightweight Crew: Men’s Double, USA
Of the three Harvard graduates representing USA men’s rowing, Andrew Campbell Jr. ’14 will be the only one competing at the lightweight level but will look to leave his mark when he begins rowing in Rio.
The New Cannan, Conn. native began competing for the United States in 2009, finishing in seventeenth in the lightweight double sculls at the U23 World Rowing Championship before earning the first sculling medal for the US since 1976 at the 2010 World Rowing Junior Championships by taking third in single sculls. At the national level, Campbell Jr. took home the title in the single sculls and lightweight double sculls at the 20120 USRowing Youth National Championships.
Campbell Jr. was named the 2011 US Rowing Man of the Year after claiming third and fourth in the lightweight single sculls at the U23 World Rowing Championships and World Rowing Championships before taking the school year off to focus on attempting to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics.
The Harvard athlete fell just short of making the Olympic team, finishing third in the lightweight doubles category at the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta but took home the bronze in the lightweight single sculls at the 2012 World Rowing Senior and Junior Championships.
Returning to the Crimson in 2013, Campbell Jr. rowed in the seventh seat of the first Varsity Eight, helping Harvard cruise to an undefeated season that saw it claim the Head of the Charles, Eastern Sprints, and the IRA National Championships. The success continued at the international level, where Campbell Jr. took home the U23 World Rowing Championships in the lightweight single sculls and seventh in the 2013 World Rowing Championships.
After ending his career with a second place finish at the IRA National Championships in 2014, Campbell Jr. claimed first in the U23 World Rowing Championships lightweight single sculls and thirteenth at the World Rowing Championships in the same event.
2015 saw Campbell Jr. make his first appearance at the World Rowing Championships with an eighth place finish in the lightweight double sculls as well as fourth in the World Rowing Cup. Just a year later, Campbell Jr. claimed sixth in the lightweight double sculls at the World Rowing Cup before qualifying for the Olympics by finishing in first place at the US Olympic trials.

Eli Dershwitz 
Fencing: Men's Individual Sabre, USA
All seems to be going according to plan for Eli Dershwitz. The Sherborn, Mass. native came into his freshman year at Harvard in 2014 already knowing he would take the next season off to compete for a spot on the USA Olympic fencing team.
The decision paid off. In March 2016 Dershwitz won the Seoul Grand Prix in South Korea, securing his opportunity to represent the United States in individual men’s sabre in Rio de Janeiro in August. The qualification placed Dershwitz on the list of seven fencers in the Crimson’s history to compete for America on the Olympic stage.
Dershwitz’s intention to take a gap year after his freshman campaign in Cambridge came as no surprise to either his coaches or his teammates, as he ranked third in USA Fencing’s national rolling points standings for senior men’s sabre at the end of the 2014-2015 season. However, the knowledge that he would not be on the team the following year did not hold Dershwitz back from becoming one of the best fencers on the NCAA circuit in his first year on the team. He concluded the season with an 84-14 overall record while tallying wins in the Tradition Tournament at Sacred Heart, St John’s Invitational, and the Ivy League Round Robin. His contributions ultimately helped the Crimson take home the Ivy League title.
In his first time competing at the NCAA Championships in 2015, Dershwitz finished with a 22-2 overall record and a +60 touch differential, a feat which awarded him third place overall.
The competition in Rio will be much different than fellow NCAA athletes, but the change is something Dershwitz is accustomed to. His laundry list of success on the international circuit transcends borders and continents, as he has won gold medals in Uzbekistan, Turkey, Canada, Costa Rica, and Poland in addition to his Grand Prix championship in South Korea.  He also took home bronze and silver medals at junior world championships in 2013 and 2013, respectively.
As of July 1, Dershwitz ranked at the top of the rolling point standings for Team USA in the senior men’s sabre division, amassing 8,230 points. This accomplishment places him more than 750 points ahead of second place teammate Daryl Homer.
Dershwitz will get his first taste of the Olympic stage on Wednesday when he faces off against Seppe Van Holsbeke of Belgium in the opening round of individual men’s sabre competition.

Shelley Pearson ‘13 
Women's Heavyweight Crew: Single Sculls, Bermuda
Hailing from Pembroke, Bermuda, Pearson will represent her home country in Rio, rowing in a women’s single scull during the Olympics.
At Harvard, Pearson cemented made three appearances on the varsity eight and four with the second varsity eight during her freshman year, culminating in her contribution to the varsity eight win in the petite final at the EAWRC Sprints at the end of the 2010 season.
Pearson, however, got her start on the international rowing stage before she began to compete for the Crimson. In 2008 and 2009 Pearson competed in the Junior Worlds for the United States, rowing in the junior women’s four.
Focusing on NCAA rowing throughout her time at Harvard, Pearson cemented her place in the varsity eight during her sophomore year and helped the varsity eight win the third-level final at the NCAA Championships with a time of 6:34.45 while sitting in both the seven and five spot.
Her junior campaign she netted the eight spot in the varsity eight and helped the boat secure a Beanpot title in a time of 6:25.9 as well as a third-place finish at the lass of 1975 Cup and an O’Leary Cup championship. The 2012 season also marked Radcliffe’s first ever Ivy League Championship Regatta, and Pearson rowed with the varsity eight which won the varsity eight grand final.
After graduating with a concentration in Psychology, Pearson has pursued both a Masters of Science and Masters of Business Administration at the University of Oxford. Returning to the rowing competitively on the international stage, Pearson transitioned to rowing for Bermuda in 2016. Her qualification for Rio de Janeiro came off the heels of the World Rowing Cup in Poznan, Poland where Pearson competed in the single scull races, finishing fifth in the first heat with a time of 8:00.880. Her times continued to drop throughout the competition, as she ranked second in her second race at 7:49.130, dropped to fifth in the semifinal and came in third in the final with her best time of the competition, 7:38.690.
With the first round of women’s single scull already in the books in the Olympics, Pearson completed her course in 8:22.150, ranking her third in her heat and 13th overall. Her time was good enough to have her move on to the quarter final round, where she will compete Tuesday.

Cheta Emba ‘15 
Women's Rugby, USA
The first ever opportunity for women’s rugby to be represented on the Olympic stage will include a Harvard graduate. Cheta Emba ’15 made the trip down to Rio with the USA Rugby 7s team to try and make history as the first ever women’s team to be awarded a gold medal.
At Harvard Emba found an unlikely tract to find her way onto the women’s rugby team. Entering her freshman year as a member of the women’s soccer team, Emba played goalie for the first two years of her collegiate athletic career. This was because for those years Radcliffe rugby belonged only on the club sports level, becoming the 42nd Crimson team to be recognized by the NCAA in the 2013-2014 season. Emba made the transition from the soccer field to the rugby pitch her junior year and quickly became one of the team’s most valuable players.
As one of the trailblazers for the Radcliffe rugby program as a varsity sport, the inaugural season saw the team go 6-16-1 and mirroring its record again the following year.
Emba was quickly recognized for her performance on the pitch when she was selected to the US National Team for the Super Series in Canada during her senior year.  The Crimson program continued to draw attention from national media as its 7’s team made it to the championship game of their own tournament in the 2014-2015 season, coming up against four-time defending 7’s national champions Norwich on March 28.
After graduation, Emba joined USA Rugby on the Women’s Eagles team, and attended multiple camps at the Olympic Training Center in addition to competing with the team. She will serve as a travel reserve for the national team as it makes its way to Rio, being one of 14 athletes chosen to play for the United States in the first women’s Rugby 7’s competition in Olympic history.
The United States kicked off its Olympic push for the first ever gold medal in women’s rugby with a game Saturday against Fiji, falling 12-7. Emba did not contribute to the game or see the field but did make the trip to Rio with the Eagles.

Brendan Hodge ’07
Men's Lightweight Rowing: Coxless Four Boat, Canada
Returning to rowing after an eight-year hiatus in international competition, Hodge will be rowing in the coxless lightweight four boat for Team Canada in the Rio Olympics. Hodge, a Government concentrator while at Harvard, joined Canada’s Olympic team after not competing on the international circuit since the 2005 World U23 Championships. His return to the sport was sparked by the appearance of the team in the London Games in 2012, and after seeing his country compete there Hodge was not ready to give up rowing altogether.
His road back to the Olympic stage started after the 2012 Games, when he began once again to train for the first time since his 2005 World Championships appearance. A year after he began training once again he was invited to train with the Canadian national team. Months later he was on the competitive platform again, racing in the 2013 World Cup where he finished 16th manning a spot on the lightweight four. In the 2013 World Championships, eight years after his last appearance in the race, he placed fourth in the lightweight pair. In the 2014 edition of the same race, he and his teammates on Canada’s lightweight four took home 13th place.
Hodge’s Olympic berth came on the heels of his boat’s gold medal performance in the 2015 Pan Am Games in Toronto, where they secured a big in Rip with their 11th place finish.
In between his time rowing for the Crimson heavyweight team and his opportunity to represent his home country in Rio, Hodge pursued a career in law, returning to his birthplace of British Columbia and attending UBC law school from 2007-2010. Following law school he began practicing law at Lawson Lundell LLP before leaving the profession behind to pursue his Olympic career in 2013.
In addition to being a member of the lightweight rowing team while at Harvard, Hodge served as a mechanic for Quadbikes.

Olivia Coffey ’11
Women's Heavyweight Rowing: Quadruple Sculls, USA
Claiming a seat on the varsity eight boat her freshman year at Harvard, Coffey took the reigns of her athletic career and never looked back. She took the same approach with her effort to represent the United States in the 2016 Olympics, taking a place as an alternate on America’s heavyweight rowing team this summer.
The Elmira, N.Y. native continued to add to her list of rowing accomplishments with the qualification, extending her rowing career five year after she left the Crimson team. Throughout her time in Cambridge, Coffey was a staple in the heavyweight varsity eight, leading the team to a silver medal at the EAWRC Sprints her sophomore year as well as aiding the team in its petite final victory her junior year.
In between her accomplishments on the collegiate circuit, Coffey found success on the world level when she competed for Team USA in the 2009 World Rowing Under 23 Championships where she won silver in the heavyweight eight. The next year the team won gold at the same race, awarding Coffey another medal. The 2011 rendition of the race brought the USA heavyweight eight a bronze medal.
Her competition both for the Crimson and team USA culminated in her senior year with Radcliffe, when she was voted co-captain, giving her the opportunity to stroke with the varsity eight all season. That year Harvard won the third-level final at the NCAA Championships with a time of 6:34.45 and brought a fifth-place finish from the EAWRC Sprints back to Cambridge.
Those achievements also garnered Coffey national attention, being named a first-team All-American as well as to the All-New England team her senior year.
Since graduating with an economics concentration, Coffey continued rowing, not being able to give up the sport she had been competing in since her 2005 debut at the Phillips Andover Academy.
In 2013 Coffey once again had the opportunity to compete for the United States on the international stage, making the heavyweight four boat and bringing home gold in the 2013 World Rowing Championships. Transitioning to the quadruple sculls in 2014, she once again medalled with Team USA, taking the bronze. 2015 added three gold medals to Coffey’s arsenal, winning the quadruple sculls at the World Rowing Championships as well gold in both the heavyweight eight and four boats at the 2015 World Rowing Cup.
To qualify for the alternate role at the Rio games, Coffey finished sixth in the quadruple sculls competition at the 2016 World Rowing Cup.

A name not normally associated with the Olympics, the Harvard women’s track and field program made its presence felt during the trials period, as a strong contingent of student athletes competed for spots on their respective nation’s roster.
Coming off of a year that saw her claim both indoor and outdoor All-American status in the shot put, rising senior Nikki Okwelogu insured a Harvard presence at the Olympics games by qualifying in the shot put.
The Fresno, Calif. native first met the Olympic qualifying standard by throwing a 17.91 mark to win the NCAA Eastern Regional competition. The senior then took home the title in the same events at the Nigerian Olympic Trials to gain a spot on the 35-person Nigerian roster.
Despite qualifying for the Olympics, Okwelogu paid her way to Brazil in order to compete after being notified that the Nigerian Federation would be unable to pay for her ticket. The rising senior set up a GoFundMe to help raise money in order to compete in Rio de Janeiro.
Back in the States, the Crimson sent a strong contingent of athletes to the US Olympic trials in Eugene, Or., with the competitors looking to secure a top-three finish in order to obtain a spot on the Olympic team.
Recent Harvard graduates Paige Kouba ’16 and Autumne Franklin ’16 led the group of five athletes that also included rising sophomore and first team outdoor All-American Gabby Thomas, rising junior and first team indoor All-American Courtney Smith, and rising senior and second team outdoor All-American Jade Miller.
Smith started off the string of performances with a 22nd place finish in the 10000 meters. Despite keeping pace with the leaders for the 1600 meters, the rising junior–who was the only collegiate competitor in the field–was unable to keep up, ultimately crossing the line with a time of 35:45.82.
A few days late, Kouba–who lives in Eugene and had been a volunteer at previous renditions of the Trials– stepped onto the track to compete in the 3000-meter steeplechase, clocking in with a time of 10:13.82, good for 31st.
Though the distance runners turned in solid performances, it was the sprinters who made some noise in the latter half of the competition.
Miller and Franklin both competed in the 400 meter hurdles, the same event the two had garnered All-American honors just a few weeks beforehand at the NCAA Championships.
Franklin posted a time of 56.17 in the first round to advance as one of the top 16 competitors, while Miller fell just short with a time of 56.77, just over half a second slower than the time needed to move on to the next round.
Franklin improved her time in the second round, finishing third with a time of 55.40 seconds before culminating her performance in the final round.
The Owning Hills, Md. native continued to improve by clocking in at 54.65 seconds but was unable to clinch a spot in the Olympics, finishing sixth overall, a half-second behind Sydney McLaughlin for the final roster spot.
Competing in the 200 meters, Thomas continued to demonstrate the impressive progress that saw her claim third in the 200 meters at the NCAA Championships in her debut season with Harvard.
After posting times of 22.91 and 22.72 seconds in the first and second rounds of the competition, Thomas was one of just three collegiate athletes in the event finals. The Florence, Mass. native replicated Franklin’s performance by taking sixth place, clocking in at 22.72 seconds, less than 0.2 seconds behind third place finisher and defending event champion Jenna Prandini.
While no Crimson athlete qualified for a spot in the US Olympic roster, the five competitors were the third most sent by a women’s collegiate program–just behind perennial powerhouses Oregon and Arkansas.

Although the start of the collegiate swimming season is still months away, 16 members of the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team took to the pool to compete at the highest national level this summer. Facing off against the fastest swimmers in the country, the group of Crimson athletes traveled to Omaha, Neb. between June 26th and July 3rd for the U.S. Olympic Team Swimming Trials. The stakes were higher than usual, with the top two finishers in each event earning the right to represent the United States at the Olympics in Rio.
Harvard’s efforts at the meet were highlighted by a standout performance from sophomore Logan Houck, who outpaced some of the nation’s strongest swimmers to qualify for the final of the 1500 free. Houck ended up in sixth place overall, 24 seconds out from an Olympic spot, and ahead of Zane Grothe, a 12-time All-American from Auburn University, and 16-year-old phenom Robert Finke.
“Logan is a complete workhorse,” senior Sava Turcan said. “He is an outlier because not a lot of the best swimmers in the Ivy League are distance guys. Harvard swimming has had a bit of a drought in great distance talents, so it’s certainly nice to see [Houck] succeed.”
A number of other Crimson athletes also had strong showings at the event, including junior Shane McNamara, who collected an 18th-place result in the 200 breast that saw him narrowly miss out on a place in the final.
Houck and McNamara also finished 28th in the 400 free and 39th in the 100 breast, respectively, while senior Christian Carbone and junior Steven Tan cracked the top 50 as well. The meet marked Carbone’s second trip to Olympic Trials, and the senior exactly equaled his mark from his first visit, ending up 30th in the 400 IM in both 2012 and 2016. Tan had the 42nd-best time in the 100 butterfly.
Continuing the run of strong Harvard results, seniors Paul O’Hara and Max Yakubovich and sophomores Gavin Springer, Daniel Tran, and Brennan Novak all finished inside the top 100.  O’Hara came in 51st in the 50 free, Novak ended up 72nd in the 400 free, Tran was 68th in the 200 back, and Yakubovich ended his race in the 100 butterfly in 80th place.
Springer and Novak also had a close race in the 1500 free, ending up 86th and 92nd, respectively.
Senior Jack Manchester and sophomore Sebastian Lutz put in competitive times at the meet as well, with Manchester ending up in 114th in the 100 back and Lutz finishing in 128th place in the 50 free.
Some of the strongest Harvard performances of the meet came from a pair of athletes who have not yet seen the pool for the Crimson.
Dean Farris and Daniel Chang, incoming Harvard freshmen, lived up to the impressive billing of the 17 high school All-America honors that they share between them. Farris competed in four events at trials and came away with a 39th-place result in the 100 free. Meanwhile, Chang ended the meet with top-100 marks in both the 100 and 200 breast events.
“Trials is a very difficult meet to swim at because of all the added hype, so for them to swim at or better than their personal bests shows a lot about their maturity and ability to handle pressure,” Turcan said.
The trials saw strong showings not only from future Crimson athletes, but from past Harvard swimmers as well. Three Crimson graduates, Alex Meyer ’10, Griffin Schumacher ’15, and Spenser Goodman ’15 made the trip to Omaha to vie for a spot on the Olympic team.
The 2016 meet marked the second trip to Olympic Trials in four years for both Schumacher and Goodman, and both athletes dramatically improved on their results from the 2012 event. Goodman ended up 60th in the 200 free, while Schumacher touched the wall 34th in the 50 free and 43rd in the 100 free. Both swimmers bettered their finishes from four years ago by at least 40 spots.
Meyer, meanwhile, has enjoyed an impressive career in swimming after leaving Harvard, and the Ithaca, N.Y. native competed at the 2012 Olympic games. He ended up in 20th place in the 1500 free at the 2016 trials.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though its season ended in mid-March, seven members of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team continued their competitive training and qualified for the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Already having 18 members of the men’s team going to Omaha, Neb. June 26-Juy 3, the women’s contingent brought more Crimson hopefuls with dreams of representing their country in the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The women who qualified for trials made up a diverse group of swimmers, both in events competing in and age. The seven swimmers consisted of four returners to the Harvard squad, two incoming freshmen who will have their first look at collegiate swimming in the fall, and one member of the program’s alumni network. Junior Geordie Enoch along with sophomores Meaghen Popp, Brittany Usinger and Sonia Wang made up the Crimson returners appearing in trials, while incoming freshmen Miki Dahlke and Matti Harrison represented the younger swimmers to make the cut. Class of 2011 alum Katie Mills was the only graduate to represent Harvard after she spent her four years with the program and continued swimming following graduation, winning a silver medal at the 2015 Pan Am Games.
None of the Crimson women qualified for the Games, and Harvard sent no swimmers overall to Rio. Only the top two finishers in each event held at the Trials qualified for the U.S. Team.
At the meet Wang and Usinger both competed in the 200 Meter Butterfly. Wang tied for 71st place, finishing in 2:12.35, while Usinger finished 81st in the race with a time of 2:13.95. Wang raced three more times over the course of trials, competing in the 100 Meter Butterfly, the 200 Meter IM, and the 400 Meter IM. Her times were 1:00.27, 2:14.90, and 4:47.59, respectively.
Enoch’s sole event was the 200 Meter IM, and she finished the race in 2:22.66, landing her in 104th place among all competitors.
Mills also competed in four events: the 100 Meter Butterfly, 200 Butterfly, 200 Meter IM, and 400 Meter IM. Her best swim came in the 400 IM, where she finished seventh with a time of 4:41.05. She also made good times in the 200 Meter Butterfly, finishing in 2:08.89, while completing her 100 Butterfly in under one minute (59:59) and her 200 IM coming in at 2:15.55.
Dahlke’s two events in Trials were the 50 and 100 Freestyle, where she finished in 26.11 and 56.34, respectively. Harrison’s performance in the 100 Backstroke, her only event, landed her a 1:03.37.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday a group of media representatives picked Harvard football to top the Ivy League—but just barely.
In an annual pundit poll, the three-peat champions edged Penn by a score of 126 points to 119. However, the Quakers garnered more first-place votes (nine) than the Crimson (seven).
Last season Harvard shared the conference title with Penn and Dartmouth, the first three-way tie since 1982. While the Crimson and the Big Green graduated starting quarterbacks and most of their defenses, the Quakers preserved a more substantial core, including play caller Alek Torgersen and breakout receiver Justin Watson.
Given the talent that Penn returns, Harvard’s retention of top-dog status signals confidence in coach Tim Murphy’s ability to wring excellence from a new lineup.
As usual, though, the field of contenders extends beyond two. The Ancient Eight may not be as evenly balanced as last year’s tripod, but talent sparkles throughout the conference.
Harvard, 126 points (seven first-place votes) 
Last year the Crimson graduated a staggering array of talent—15 starters, nine first-team All-Ivy players, four NFL signees, three starting linebackers, and an All-Ivy quarterback.
The most glaring challenge in 2016, then, is to escape the shadow of what Murphy has called “arguably the most successful senior class in Harvard football history.”
Captain and fifth-year senior Sean Ahern will provide constancy at cornerback, but he’ll play alongside a renovated secondary and a fresh trio of starting linebackers.
Offensively senior Joe Viviano and sophomore Tommy Stewart are battling for the top quarterback spot. Last preseason Viviano broke his left foot, and he broke his right one during winter workouts; the injuries gave Stewart a chance to move up the depth chart, creating the current competition.
Certainly the Crimson returns key contributors—senior tight end Anthony Firkser and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley will headline the aerial attack, while junior Larry Allen Jr. and senior Max Rich will anchor the offensive line.
But as training camp dawns, Harvard faces as many questions as answers.
“We’re used to setting the bar high, but this group [from 2015] was really special,” Murphy said. “To lose that nucleus…is a little bit daunting and certainly unprecedented for us.”
Penn, 119 points (nine first-place votes)
A seasoned quarterback. A dangerous group of receivers, highlighted by a speedy first option. A powerful inside linebacker.
In 2015 the Crimson rode this combination to first-place success; in 2016 Penn hopes to duplicate the feat.
The Quakers boast senior quarterback Alek Torgersen, the projected Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, and junior wideout Justin Watson, the lone conference star to be mentioned as a possible FCS Offensive Player of the Year. Even behind a diminished offensive line, the Torgersen-Watson combination is surely the most explosive in the league.
Although the defense will lose linebacker Tyler Drake, who won Ivy League Defense Player of the Year last season, Penn can take solace in remaining linebacker Donald Panciello. Despite missing a week in 2015, the then-junior finished second in tackles.
Even special teams promises improvement, as junior punter Hunter Kelley and senior kicker Jimmy Gammill return.
Already loaded with talent in 2015, Penn enters this fall with new experience, not to mention a hunger for an undisputed title.
Dartmouth, 83 points
 “A lot of new faces…. We did graduate a good number of people that were significant players.”
So began coach Buddy Teeven’s assessment of his 2016 squad. As with Harvard, Dartmouth must cope with a great deal of turnover, including the graduation of 10 of 11 defensive starters, supernova quarterback Dalyn Williams, and top receiver Victor Williams.
Senior linebacker Folarin Orimolade is the lone holdover from the 2015 defense, and according to College Sports Madness, he’s slated to be Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year. Beyond on-field performance, Orimolade—who is one of three captains—will shoulder leadership responsibilities.
Offensively junior Jack Heneghan and sophomore Bruce Dixon IV will duke it out for the top quarterback role; whoever triumphs will have the benefit of playing alongside junior Ryder Stone, the 205-pound running back who led the program in rushing yards last year.
Such a roster refresh presents real difficulties, but in a teleconference, Teevens sounded a hopeful note.
“Philosophically we like to play a lot of people,” he said. “[There’s] a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. Guys see an opportunity to compete and play.”
Yale, 81 points
Per coach Tony Reno, the central theme of Yale’s preseason is competition—not against other teams but within a deep Bulldogs program.
“For the first time since we’ve been here as staff, we’ve got competition at every level,” he said. “Our approach in the offseason was to get better, specifically in the strength area.”
The most evident site of competition is the quarterback role, where four contenders will vie to replace Morgan Roberts. In his three years with the program, Roberts racked up more passing yards (6,182) than any other Yale graduate.
Matters are more settled on defense, as 12 of the top 14 tacklers on the team will suit up in 2016. Complimenting this contingent is senior Foyesade Oluokon, an All-Ivy safety in 2014 who sat out last year with an injury.
Still, a year after finishing fourth, the Bulldogs face a stiff task in leapfrogging the reigning tri-champions.
Princeton, 79 points
 Versatile athleticism defines this year’s Princeton team.
First there is John Lovett, a first-team All-Ivy selection last year. Sometimes lining up as a dual-threat quarterback, the junior will take snaps at running back this season, hoping to match his 6.5 yard-per-carry average in 2015.
Then there is Charlie Volker. Last December the then-freshman, who also competes for the track team, broke the school record in the 60-yard dash. Such speed will be on display come September, as Volker will share carries with Lovett.
Senior quarterback Chad Kanoff holds the keys to this high-powered offense, and coach Bob Surace has indicated that, in keeping with past years, the team will play up-tempo.
Whether the defense can keep up with this frenetic pace is a different question. But the Tigers sport impressive depth in the front seven, giving reason to believe that Princeton will be a tough out this season.
Brown, 61 points (one first-place vote)
By most measures, last season’s Harvard-Brown matchup—which ended as a 53-27 Crimson rout—was not an entertaining contest. It was, however, a revealing glimpse into the Bears’ future.
In the second half of that game, then-junior Kyle Moreno relieved starter Marcus Fuller and put on a fine performance, totaling 307 yards on 20-of-31 passing. This year Moreno returns as Brown’s true starter, and he’ll likely spend a lot of time connecting with senior wide receiver Alexander Jette, the Bears’ lone selection on the 2015 All-Ivy first team.
Also in that Harvard beatdown, a young defensive unit held the Crimson scoreless in the final 20 minutes of play. Led by senior defensive end Richard Jarvis, that unit returns mostly intact for 2016.
However, the true strength of this season’s Bears was on display throughout all of 2015, rout or not. That strength is the offensive line, which returns all five starters this year.
Averaging close to 300 pounds per person, this wall of large men will aim to ensure that Brown finishes .500 or better for the tenth straight year.
Columbia, 43 points
Last season play-calling duties for Columbia alternated between Florida transfer Skyler Mornhinweg and then-sophomore Anders Hill. This two-faced monster will rear its head again in 2016, except Mornhinweg and Hill will be a year older.
While quarterbacks matter, perhaps the most important returning member of the Lions is the man who sits above Mornhinweg and Hill, namely coach Al Bagnoli. Prior to last season, the Penn legend made headlines by un-retiring to revive a hapless Columbia program.
One season and two wins later, the verdict is in: Not even Bagnoli can work immediate miracles. Yet the 2015 squad made obvious progress, posting the first conference win since 2012 and falling to Harvard and Dartmouth by a combined 12 points.
It will be up to Mornhinweg, Hill, and a slew of other veterans to further the process that Bagnoli has started. On defense seniors Keith Brady (linebacker), Gianmarco Rea (linebacker), and Christian Conway (defensive back) will play an especially instrumental role as the Lions continue their long march to relevance.
Cornell, 20 points
It’s possible to spin Cornell’s season outlook in two ways.
On one hand, the Big Red owns arguably the best player in the conference, a rising senior who has shattered Ivy League competition and earned preseason attention as a potential second-team All-American.
On the other hand, that player is a punter.
Yes, Chris Fraser has performed at a remarkable level for Cornell, but the team has not returned the favor. Last year, the Big Red won a single game (against Columbia), and barring a preseason turnaround, the team seems at risk of a similarly dismal showing.
Gone is Luke Hagy, the bruising running back who carried Cornell’s offense from time to time; at training camp, four or five players will compete to replace him.
The Big Red also sports competition at the quarterback position, although sophomore Dalton Banks has the upper hand heading into the season.
Hope springs more freely on defense, as senior linebackers Jackson Weber and Miles Norris provide a core of strength up the middle. Even so, given the depth of other teams, Cornell faces an uphill battle in Ancient Eight play.
