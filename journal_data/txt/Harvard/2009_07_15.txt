MUMBAI, India - In the days after the Indian elections on May 16, until the finance minister’s speech on July 6, the nation discussed only one subject: the budget of the incoming government. The Congress Party, reelected to power after holding office for the past five years, had won a large enough majority of parliamentary seats to create a governing coalition free of leftists—like members of the Communist Party—who had slowed market reforms in the past. The new government, more moderate and centrist in composition than in its past term, won such a large majority, in fact, that officials promised very bold action to continue India’s economic rise.
 The country’s rapid economic growth in the past decade has been fueled by a transition to the open market, and for the country to continue at this pace, it needs more open market reforms. The economy is still hampered by strict government regulation and distorted by enormous government spending, and though regulation and spending are understandable reactions to the global economic crisis of the last year, Indians were rightly expecting the continuation of the reform agenda in this year’s budget. 
In India, the Congress Party’s budget announcement has come to be one of the defining moments of the fiscal year (which ends in March). In a still heavily regulated economy, government action on major economic issues can have a profound impact on the nation, attracting foreign investment and fueling rapid growth. Thus, every newspaper and television station provided special coverage on the budget for the month preceding the announcement. Publications issued countless surveys, and every business leader offered their recommendations and predictions. 
When July 6 arrived, every station carried the budget address, delivered by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. And the nation was in for quite a surprise.  While Mukherjee did announce significant fiscal stimulus plans, expanding rural employment, and development programs, he did not mention any specific open-market reforms, such as raising foreign investment levels, divestment of public enterprise, or deficit reduction. After Mukherjee had signaled to the entire nation that he would follow through on these reforms, the speech was a major disappointment.
For someone offering few substantive changes, the finance minister seemed awfully proud in his speech, congratulating his party on avoiding the worst of the financial crisis. Yet, smug as he might have been, the reality is grim: According to the World Bank, in 2005 456 million Indians still lived in poverty. Mukherjee’s plans to combat this are well intentioned, but will only temporarily help to alleviate the plight of the poor. It will take the spread of private industry and finance to permanently raise their standard of living. 
The government could have painlessly enabled this development of the free market through selling state-owned businesses, loosening regulations on foreign direct investment, and creating a plan to reduce the deficit. India achieved 6.7 percent growth this past fiscal year only on the back of intensive government spending by the previous Congress-led coalition. Public-sector spending provides a short-term stimulus, but a more open economy is necessary for sustainable growth.
For India’s economy to return to the 9 percent growth it enjoyed in the 2007 and 2008 fiscal years, liberalization must continue. State control over public enterprise and limits to investment still create massive inefficiencies in the economy that prevent India from realizing its full potential.  The Congress Government was overwhelmingly reelected on the promise of greater reforms and more growth—and they should have followed through on those promises in the budget. Having failed to do so, they cannot delay the reforms any longer. There are a billion people who should not have to wait.

ROME, Italy — Last week, I was walking to the Fontana di Trevi when a street vendor’s wares caught my eye. No, it wasn’t the Sexy Roman Priests 2010 Calendar (though tempting)—I found myself staring at a different calendar entirely, labeled Il Duce. “This has to be a joke,” I thought to myself.  But as I wearily flipped through it, I saw pictures that portrayed a strong Italian leader.  The Benito Mussolini of this calendar was no buffoon.  
I looked for the street vendor; he was a harmless looking middle-aged Pakistani gentleman. “Someone should tell him,” I thought.  “Someone should tell him this is not okay.”  It’s embarrassing; it should be tucked behind dozens of Roman Holiday calendars.  Let’s sell the tourists black-and-white photos of Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck eating gelato, not images of Mussolini inspiring false and dangerous notions of Italian greatness through racism.  
I didn’t say anything, though.  I kept walking through the beautiful streets of Rome, a knot in my stomach.  I suppose I didn’t want to cause a scene and I was struggling to accept a greater and more disquieting truth: If the vendor had put the calendar in front, it was probably a popular item.  People are buying these souvenirs and putting them in their kitchens.  They might be marking birthdays, dinner parties, or play-dates under Il Duce’s watchful eye. 
At work, I mentioned the calendar to one of my colleagues.  She wasn’t the least bit surprised, mentioning that some of her friends thought Mussolini wasn’t half bad (she, of course, completely disagreed with them).  She reminded me of something Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said in 2003.  In an interview with English magazine The Spectator, he was quoted as calling Il Duce a “benign” dictator, saying “Mussolini never killed anyone” and “Mussolini just sent people on holiday to confine them.” 
Of course, many Italian politicians responded with outrage.  They pointed out that Nazi concentration camps were no vacation spot.  Yet, the leader of Italy’s Jewish community, Amos Luzzato, said he was “not surprised, just saddened” by the Prime Minister’s remarks.  
My response to the calendar was, perhaps, naive.  My second week in Italy, I got into a fight with a friend at a dinner party over his description of European Jews. 
“They always live in the best neighborhoods,” he said.  “They inherit all their wealth and then they don’t have to work.”  
That was a remark I couldn’t let go; keeping my calm, I gave my host a lecture on European history.  Perhaps Rome’s Jewish ghetto is a fashionable neighborhood now, but that wasn’t the case in 1943. Did he, by any chance, remember Italy’s racial laws under Mussolini?
He admitted that his was view narrow-minded, but probably still has no idea that he made a faux-pas.  He was surprised when I didn’t call him for two weeks after the party. For me it was an incident; for him it was a conversation. 
All of this makes me overwhelmingly sad.  I love this country; I spent almost every summer, and many winter and spring breaks visiting my grandmother in Rome.  Sitting at my kitchen table, overlooking the roofs of the city, I cannot help but think that it is the most beautiful place in the world.  Yet, the current political trends here turn my stomach.  
I believe Italians can do better.  They can do better than Silvio Berlusconi, better than the Lega Nord (a xenophobic political party that is currently part of the coalition that forms the government), and better than the new anti-immigration laws, which criminalize illegal immigration, allow citizen brigades to comb the streets for illegals, and harshly penalize renting a room to an undocumented individual.  They can certainly do better than a tasteless calendar of Il Duce, a celebration of one of Italy’s darkest moments.  The question is: will they? 
Italy does not need to look for its glory days in its fascist past.  It does not even need to look longingly at the Renaissance and the Roman Empire (though, unlike the fascist period, it would do well to take these moments as inspiration).  Italy has always been a country marked by the enormous creativity of its citizens.  I truly hope young Italians will embrace this aspect of their history and make it central to the nation’s future.

CHANG CHUN, China— Hot pot, as suggested by its name, is simply a pot of boiling water, seasoned or not, into which diners fling food, wait for it to cook, fish it out, and consume. I consider myself somewhat of a hot-pot connoisseur, having indulged in many delicious regional varieties, including the characteristically tasty Xi’an hot pot, the lamb hot pot of the Northeast, and the Sichuan duck-gizzard hot pot, known to be one of the spiciest foods on the planet. Yet, I continue to be impressed and surprised by the gusto and creativity with which the Chinese attack fine cuisine.
Case in point: Last Friday, a restaurant with an innocuous name and façade offered one of the most delicious and amusing culinary experiences I’ve ever had.
The first thing I noticed when I entered the restaurant was the electric trains—you know, little model trains that made adorable choo-choo noises. The whole environment, complete with oval stone bridges, frosted glass dividers, and delicate watercolor paintings, gave a quirky vibe, a mix of Eastern traditional decor and the Western industrial revolution.
The cars and cabooses chugged along tracks that circled diners’ tables, which were arranged in a big loop and named. Ours was the Beijing Station Platform #6. Each car carried a plate of food that diners could reach out and grab as the train passed by. With four looping tracks, and each vehicle carrying dishes with different prices, I counted at least 35 food options to hot pot, including five types of mushrooms (one, a cutely shaped species I’d never seen in America before). The food delivery method created an amusing, interactive buffet, a clever combination of eating and entertainment. I had never seen anything like it.
Even cleverer: the way the meal was marketed. Diners pay the base price, plus the cost of whatever dishes they eat. Because a waitress would arrive at your station and remove the empty plates, there was an urge to always grab more from the toy trains, which passed by with convenient frequency. All this encouraged patrons to completely stuff themselves. Which I totally did.
And, did I mention the hot pot itself was absolutely delicious?

PENNSAUKEN, N.J. — The following is an excerpt from the last page of the diary of Nathaniel S. Rakich, ethnologist and professional snob. The diary was found in southern New Jersey on July 5, 2009, where Rakich told friends he was researching the indigenous population in its natural habitat. Tragically, due to the incompatibility of his “subjects” with his own elitist customs, he never returned.
