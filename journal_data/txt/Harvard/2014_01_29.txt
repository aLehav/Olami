After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The appropriations bill that was passed earlier this month sets the federal government’s budget for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2014, and is regarded by many as a sign of good things to come. Congress demonstrated its oft-doubted ability to work cooperatively by passing this bi-partisan bill, and many of the funding cuts that were made during the “sequester” this past March were softened. In particular, the new appropriations bill allocated more money for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), among other research-sponsoring agencies. In many cases, however, total funds still did not match pre-sequester numbers. While we recognize this restoration of funding as a step in the right direction, Congress must continue to restore funding to the various catalysts of research in the United States. Congress should recognize the scientific and economic benefits of research and look to other areas, such as entitlements and defense, to find savings.
Though the bill gives back some of the funding to the NIH and NSF that was lost after the sequester, it does not restore federal funding to its pre-sequester level. Limiting the ability of these organizations to give grants and fund important research affects research institutions across the nation, and Harvard is no exception. Increasing the federal contribution to the NIH and NSF is certainly beneficial, but until funding reaches or surpasses the levels of pre-sequester, we will continue to have to understaff labs or turn away projects entirely. Continuing to underfund research institutions can only result in fewer contributions to science and technology during a time when both are incredibly important to the world economy; now is the time to actually increase the number of opportunities for American scientists, as important discoveries are waiting to be made in medicine, energy, and countless other fields.
Indeed, evidence suggests that funding scientific research is actually beneficial to the economy, creating high-paying jobs and brighter futures. This would suggest that instead of including scientific research in budget cut proposals, Congress should invest in research, even in the face of large deficits. Although increased spending is unpopular in a still fragile economy, it will yield long-term dividends.
We understand, however, that demanding more funding for certain areas without reducing funding in others does not compute. Instead of cutting scientific research, however, we invite Congress to revisit other areas and organizations that receive funding from the federal government. Our lawmakers should focus on removing inefficiencies in the system, which are especially notorious in the Department of Defense. Additionally, we encourage Congress to also look at entitlement programs more closely, as we have opined in the past.
Although the newly passed appropriations bill is not perfect, we do appreciate that it is a step towards restoring funding to research. If this trend continues, we can expect to see actual economic benefit backed by exciting advances in areas from basic science to cancer treatment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One month ago – on December 26 – I was on the road, driving home from a family ski trip in Killington, Vermont. Snow was falling heavily; ice and slush covered the roads. Not far from the resort, the narrow mountain road started heading downhill. As I tried to brake gently at the beginning of a tight curve, my car skidded on the ice.
I lost control of my 4,000-pound SUV for a few terrifying moments. I was headed straight towards a collision with another car from the opposite direction. In the end, I managed to avoid the crash; I took my only other option – a ditch on the side of the road. My car came to a rest inches away from the jagged edge of a mountain cliff.
My story is not unique. It has been known for a long time now that snowfall greatly enhances the dangers of driving. There have been numerous studies linking increased rates of car crashes and snow. In 1997, Keith Knapp, Leland Smithson, and Aemal Khattak found that the rate of car crashes in snowstorms in Iowa was 14 times higher than the non-storm crash rate; in 1998, Mircea-Paul Andreescu and David Frost showed that 20 more accidents occurred on snowy days in Quebec than on dry days. Similar studies focusing on England and the US point to the same conclusion – that driving in the snow is dangerous.
The reasons are clear. Snowy conditions lead to slippery and slushy roads and decrease tire traction – a problem often compounded by lowered visibility and black ice. Drivers are more likely to lose control with cars slipping and skidding on icy surfaces. The difficulties are further exacerbated by drivers’ relative unfamiliarity with such situations.
Theoretically, driver’s education would teach all students how to deal with dangerous circumstances. However, my experience with driver’s ed suggested a different set of priorities – the instructors discussed driving on icy roads only briefly, even though ice can be seen on the roads here in Massachusetts for almost three months each year. Instructors were much more focused on the basics of driving, on ensuring that students understood the rules of the road.
The current driver’s ed curriculum in Massachusetts is bogged down by too many hours in the classroom. Drivers under the age of 18 must spend 30 hours in the classroom, drive for 12 hours with an instructor, complete 6 hours of observation from the backseat of a training vehicle, and log an additional 40 hours of driving. The practice hours on the road are undoubtedly helpful for teenagers as they begin to learn how to drive; however, the classroom instruction is often overly repetitive and of little benefit to the learner. The lessons I took were wasted on videos of road rage incidents. Far too many hours were spent on the same basic skills. Moreover, the observation hours are utterly useless–my instructor believed that there was nothing to be learned from the backseat of a car, and so I never logged a single one.
Indeed, some of the excess classroom and observation hours should be eliminated. Instead, teenage drivers in Massachusetts (and other northern states) should be required to spend half a day at schools dedicated to driving under extreme weather conditions. Such schools are naturally more prevalent in the northern states – the North Atlantic Chapter of the Audi Club sponsors a Winter Driving School each year in New Hampshire, while Bridgestone runs a similar school in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. These are just two examples (there are many others)—the important thing is that students at winter driving schools learn to maneuver in snowy and icy conditions by practicing through controlled skids.
Winter driving schools are needed because, truthfully, classroom lessons about driving on ice are useless in real life. No whiteboard diagram or instructional video can replicate actual road conditions. These lessons are tremendously difficult to apply on the road, since the proper course of action is entirely counterintuitive – most people are freaked out at the thought of turning into a skid and accelerating. Even though I have driven in the snow and on icy roads for years, I still panicked when my car began skidding out of control. In the heat of the moment, in that instant when I realized that the car was no longer responding to my touch and my control, I forgot all the lessons of driver’s education. Faced with an oncoming car, I froze.
Teaching students through action is much more effective than writing tips on a whiteboard – the only way to prevent panic is through practice. More experience with driving on snow will provide learners with a better feel for the road and their cars. Half a day spent outside at a winter driving school will make a bigger impact than a dozen hours wasted inside a classroom.
As much as I love the snow and the beauty it brings to winters in New England, its presence on our roads seriously increases the danger of driving. If we change the requirements of driver’s education in Massachusetts to include some form of winter driving practice or risk training, everyone can be a little more at ease on the road.

Those of you familiar with India know what I mean when I say the country suffers from too much monkey business. Rhesus macaques menace India’s urban areas, biting people, spreading disease, and causing a general nuisance—so much so that some cities have proposed that the simian miscreants be given oral contraceptives to keep their numbers in check.
 
This problem poses a challenge for the highest echelons of government: Not only did mango-eating monkeys nearly spoil a recent photo op with American Vice President Joe Biden; the creatures also threaten the country’s very seat of power. While strolling around the Central Secretariat in New Delhi last March, I happened to notice a troop of monkeys swarming the walls of the building in defiance of a security guard’s efforts to shoo them away.
 
So India has a problem with its primates? Send ‘em our way. Instead of destroying the landscaping around India’s parliament, the monkeys could be put to good use inside the U.S. Capitol.
 
Many might argue that Washington has enough apes of its own, though at least ours refrain from throwing trash and relieving themselves in public areas. (Or do they? Nature calls even during filibusters.) I assert, however, that India’s monkeys have the potential to eliminate one of the great political annoyances of our time: obstructionism in the Senate.
 
Now, I’ll concede that some legislation does in fact deserve to be blocked. The monkeys would simply be used to increase the cost of doing so, thereby ensuring that only the most heinous bills and appointees be filibustered. My plan is ruthlessly simple: For every hour of needless hot air expended, one monkey should be released onto the Senate floor.
 
The first few monkeys might not be so bad—apart from picking at Ted Cruz’s masterfully coiffed hair, they wouldn’t do too much damage. Things would start to get interesting around hour six or seven, when the monkey population would reach critical mass. After half a day in a stuffy room, the creatures would begin to live up to their reputation. Hungry, bored monkeys are vicious monkeys, and the usual staidness of the Senate would degenerate into the law of the jungle.
 
By my calculations, Congress would have to halt proceedings upon the release of the tenth monkey into the chamber. No sane legislator could tolerate this one-to-ten monkey-Senator ratio for more than five minutes. The current occupant of the storied “candy desk,” Illinois Senator Mark Kirk, would be unlikely to survive for more than this length of time—and death by monkey is an awful way to go. (Just consider the unfortunate case of King Alexander of Greece, who died after an attack by his pet Barbary macaque.)
 
The Senate would have to appoint an official monkey keeper, much as the Gibraltar Regiment appointed an “Officer-in-Charge of the Apes” to care for the territory’s primate population. This individual would be equal in rank to the Senate Chaplain and would oversee the day-to-day care of his or her charges. The monkeys themselves would reside in the offices of the most junior member of the Senate, except during longer recesses, when they would serve as teaching tools in local civics classes.
 
While the Senate might lose its aristocratic veneer as a result of this new measure, everyday Americans could take comfort in the fact that their elected representatives would no longer have to contend with frivolous filibustering and other forms of gratuitous obstructionism. It only seems fair to fight fire with fire—monkey business is monkey business, whether the blame lies with Senators or with actual primates.
 
After all, as H.L. Mencken once wrote, “Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey-cage.”

When did Buzzfeed start to take over the Internet? From the daily lists that crowd my Facebook newsfeed to the animal memes on every computer screen in lecture, it’s hard to escape the Buzz. I, too, had a Buzzfeed obsession for a while. I would peruse lists late at night as a stress release, occasionally emitting a “lol” at a particularly resonating post. But these days I’ve come to think that Buzzfeed is seriously, even sickeningly flawed.
 
As a news source, Buzzfeed is hyperbolic, exploitive, and desensitizing. As a fun site for lists and gifs, it whitewashes individualized colorful experiences and feeds a narcissistic nostalgia already too prevalent among our generation. I have read countless lists with titles along the lines of “50 Things You Miss About the ‘90s” that simultaneously reduce my own personal experiences to mere symptoms of mass culture and also plunge me into a strange yearning for a past of Cabbage Patch Kids (even though I was always more of a My Little Pony girl). Buzzfeed’s main takeaway is speed—read a quick article summarizing the health care debate, remember your childhood with a few swift clicks—and its emphasis on rapid-fire too often feels soulless.
 
 The way that Buzzfeed presents “hardcore news” side by side with adorable pictures of cats is psychotic. In the same radius you’re expected to contemplate headlines such as “Bomb Kills 50” and “Adorable Puppy Rides Bicycle.” With this juxtaposition, the reader’s emotions are confused: horror and sweetness become repellently mixed. The emotional intensity of a story is cheapened, and our respect for the integrity of the site questioned. It seems intuitive that we ought to separate stories about fat cats from stories on suicide bombers. But Buzzfeed constantly blurs the lines.
 
Am I being dramatic? Let’s look at just this week. On January 23, the horrifying story “Indian Woman Allegedly Gang-Raped On Orders from Her Village Council” was featured directly above “This is Just What Lambs Do When you Pick them Up.” On January 27, the disturbing piece “HIV Student Allegedly Filmed Secret Sex With more than 30 Unknowing Partners” was right below “16 Things Teen Girls Wore in the Winter of 1996.” Buzzfeed treats violence and hardship simply as additional forms of entertainment, and the ultimate effect is to desensitize the reader.
 
Buzzfeed also introduces stories without coming clean about those stories’ connections to advertising. On his popular blog, “The Dish,” Andrew Sullivan writes of Buzzfeed’s unethical mixing of editorial and advertising content. As he puts it in his piece “Guess Which Buzzfeed Piece is an Ad,” some Buzzfeed posts are “sponsored” by advertisers—it is sometimes unclear until halfway through the article that you are reading a carefully constructed ad. The sell is so soft it’s hard to notice. Sullivan points specifically to two Buzzfeed posts about the new Playstation 4. One of the posts is written by Buzzfeed staff and is titled “The Only Post You Need to Read About the Playstation 4”; the other is written by Buzzfeed’s “partner,” Sony Entertainment, and is titled “11 Things You Didn’t Know about Playstation.” The two articles are basically identical in terms of form, structure, and tone. These types of posts are deliberately ambiguous, combining opinion and promotion. And while it’s a clever tactic, it’s not an ethical one. What if Buzzfeed put its resources behind a dangerous product, like cigarettes? Would we be alarmed to see “40 Things We Love about Smoking,” or would we numbly accept it?
 
 When it’s not sneakily selling products, Buzzfeed is telling me what to do and how to feel. There are countless posts like “Can You Make it Through This Post Without Crying?” replete with images of dying gorillas or stock photos of homelessness. Journalism in any form should let the story speak for itself. Buzzfeed too often crams emotions down our throats and orders us to “watch this” or “feel that.” It asks, “are you crying yet?”
 
But there is perhaps nothing more prominent on Buzzfeed than the endless lists that try to package up childhood memories and other human experiences into neat, meme-littered posts. I admit that I’ve found it fun to read lists that recount the boy bands of the ‘90s that I’ve forgotten or describe things that annoy New Yorkers. The illumination of the everyday is sometimes hilarious and trips down memory lane to the days of Nick Carter and TLC can be silly and fun.
 
But the incessant flow of these posts, inundating us with images of our generation’s “collective past,” prods the narcissism in all of us, already powerfully manifest on Facebook and Instagram. Every day becomes a “Throwback Thursday” — we get caught up in our own memories, rather than progressing as adults. Furthermore, the assumption that everyone has the same past experiences—we all remember that movie from 1995!—simply doesn’t hold true. Who is Buzzfeed to tell me that, as a girl born in the ‘90s, I must have loved “Felicity”? I hated that show!
 
I’m not trying to dictate to people what they should enjoy reading. I’m just noting some pernicious qualities to watch out for. Before tearing up at a post or seething with anger at a news story, remember that relevance and impartiality are sometimes casualties in Buzzfeed’s incessant quest to make you feel.

Anthropology professor emeritus Stanley J. Tambiah, described by colleagues as one of the giants of 20th century anthropology and who was known for his studies of Buddhism and South Asia, passed away on Jan. 19 after a long illness, three days after his 85th birthday.
Called “Tambi” by those who knew him well, Tambiah was a native of Sri Lanka and first joined the Harvard faculty in 1976 after teaching at the University of Chicago and the University of Cambridge. He taught at Harvard for 35 years as one of the first full professors of South Asian descent, according to neurology professor S. Allen Counter, director of The Harvard Foundation.
“He was a great Thai studies and Buddhism expert who was known for meticulously detailed and conceptually rich ethnographic studies of religious rituals and cultural traditions and the way that they came together in on the ground practices,” said Arthur M. Kleinman, an anthropology professor who was both a student and colleague of Tambiah. “What distinguished him was in addition to being a superb field researcher, he was also the author of bold theoretical statements.”
Colleagues remember Tambiah as a humble yet “lion-hearted” man with a brilliant mind, noteworthy for his love for life and a “smile that lit up the world,” said Charles S. Hallisey, a close friend and former teaching colleague of Tambiah’s.
“Everything that was beautiful about the world, he loved,” Hallisey said.
In the latter part of his career, Tambiah focused his work on the study of political violence, a topic that “affected him greatly” as a native of Sri Lanka, Kleinman said.
“It wasn’t just an academic topic to him, there was an imperative to it,” said Hallisey, a lecturer at Harvard Divinity School. “He was alert to the way scholarship could contribute to the betterment of the world.”
Kleinman said that Tambiah left the world of academia a legacy of his views on studying anthropology.
“His point was that what distinguished anthropology was an initial engagement with what was culturally specific and locally important, and as a last step, a translation from that into what was comparative and universal,” Kleinman said.
Counter echoed the sentiment that Tambiah meant a great deal to the discipline.
“He is a great loss because he’s a terrific scholar,” Counter said, adding that he always “felt like a student” in Tambiah’s presence.
John D. Rogers, a close friend of Tambiah’s, said that although the scholar was a prominent figure in the academic community, he will be remembered for his kindness toward junior academics.
“He was always someone who, in academia, treated people as individuals and didn’t make assumptions based on their positions within the academic hierarchy,” Rogers said. “He was a very kind and sensitive man.”
Beyond his accomplishments in anthropology, Tambiah also brought a perspective and mindset that contributed to the “internationalizing of Harvard” that made the institution a “world university,” Hallisey said.
Kleinman, who is also director of the Harvard Asia Center, said that Tambiah is honored with a lecture series on Thai studies hosted by the center.
Tambiah  is survived by his two sons, grandchildren, a younger sister, and a former wife.

Thomas M. Ferrick, the Humanist chaplain at Harvard for more than 30 years, died on Dec. 30 in Cambridge, Mass.
Ferrick began his tenure at Harvard in 1974 with the founding of the first university Humanist chaplaincy in the world.
Ferrick, who had grown up as an orphan with his sister Dorothy E. Cogan, spent his early life as an active member of the Catholic Church. After graduating from Holy Cross College in 1951, Ferrick went on to be ordained as a priest and served as the Catholic Chaplain at Dartmouth College.
Ferrick said he first began to question his Catholic faith long before he came to Harvard.
“One doesn’t lose faith overnight in the religion that supported him and inspired him through all his mature years,” Ferrick told the Boston Globe in 1973. “It erodes, I think, by virtue of the keen observation of life and the judgment that no earthly authority can assume so wide a competence as the Catholic Church did.”
For Ferrick, an openly gay man, the Catholic Church’s position on many social issues, such as contraception and homosexuality puzzled him, said Joe F. Gerstein, president of the Greater Boston Humanists and long time friend of Ferrick.
“[Tom was] completely disillusioned by the political shenanigans…within the priesthood, administration, and so forth,” Gerstein said.
Ferrick left the priesthood in 1969 and, according to Gerstein, was excommunicated by the Catholic Church years later.
When Ferrick came to Harvard as the Humanist chaplain, he did not allow his own qualms with religious life to adversely affect his work and his mission to promote open religious and Humanist  discussion at Harvard. Rather, he encouraged religious diversity at the University, which previously only recognized chaplaincies for the Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic faiths.
 
“[Ferrick was] really active in getting religious representatives into the chaplaincy,” Gerstein said.
 
Friends of Ferrick said that although he did not actively seek influence or publicity, he nonetheless had a profound effect on the religious and Humanist life at Harvard and in the greater Boston area.
 
“Tom was given the chance to be a pioneer because he asked the University for no money, and because it was assumed the idea of a chaplain for atheists and agnostics would fail,” current Harvard Humanist Chaplain and Vice President of the Harvard Chaplains Greg M. Epstein wrote in The Huffington Post.
That assumption was swept away as Ferrick gained admirers. John L. Loeb ’24, who read about the chaplain’s work in a Harvard Gazette article, included an endowment of $800,000 for the Humanist chaplaincy in a $70 million donation Loeb and his wife granted the University in the early 1990s.
 
Ferrick handed over the Humanist chaplaincy to Epstein in 2005.
 
Epstein, who said that his career as a Humanist chaplain began with the role that Ferrick played for him as a mentor, added that Ferrick would be impressed with the increasing presence of humanism on campus and the diversity of religious chaplains that the University now has.
 
“Tom would have been shocked by the level of activity that we are having,” Epstein said.
 A memorial service will be held for Ferrick on Sunday, March 2 at 1:30 p.m. at the recently opened Humanist Hub at 30 JFK St.

Harvard’s endowment grew at a slower rate than the national average for American colleges and universities, as well as many of its peer institutions, in fiscal year 2013, according to data released Tuesday by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute.
In each of the past ten years, Harvard’s endowment has outperformed the NACUBO average and remains the most valuable of the 835 schools that participated in the survey at more than $32 billion. This year, however, the average NACUBO school saw returns of 11.7 percent, while Harvard’s endowment grew by 11.3 percent.
In a letter accompanying the University’s FY 2013 financial report, which was released in November 2013, Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo celebrated the 11.3 percent return, which she wrote exceeded the HMC’s “policy portfolio benchmark.”
“As we have noted previously, earning returns in excess of the markets as represented in the Policy Portfolio is not easily done and is not expected every year,” Mendillo wrote.
Universities commonly set such benchmarks to reflect individual long-term priorities and risk-management strategy. During the financial crisis in FY 2009, Harvard’s endowment lost nearly $11 billion in value—falling to $26 billion from $36.9 billion in FY 2008. Since the financial crisis, Mendillo has emphasized risk management strategies in investing as the endowment has slowly recovered.
Kevin Galvin, a University spokesperson, reiterated HMC’s commitment to outperforming its internally set policy portfolio benchmark.
 
"At HMC, the primary goal is to beat the benchmark policy portfolio, which is calibrated to meet the long-term needs of the University's research and education mission. Our 11.3 percent return in fiscal [year] 2013 exceeded our benchmark by a healthy 213 basis points and contributed about $600 million of additional value above the markets,” Galvin wrote in a statement Tuesday evening. “Our focus remains on outperforming the markets allocated by our policy portfolio.”
Harvard also drained more funds from its endowment than many of its peers, drawing $1.5 billion dollars, or 5.5 percent of the endowment, to fund University operations in 2013. The NACUBO average endowment payout rate for institutions with endowments over $1 billion was 4.8 percent in FY 2013.
This year, Harvard was outpaced by the rest of the Ivy League, where University of Pennsylvania’s 14.4 percent endowment return led a strong year of collective investing for the eight-school conference. Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth also had returns over 12 percent, and Columbia and Cornell finished with 11.5 percent and 11.4 percent returns, respectively. Stanford also outperformed Harvard, finishing with 12.1 percent investment growth, while MIT matched Harvard at 11.3 percent.

Ari Shavit’s critically acclaimed book “My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel” delves into the controversy surrounding Israel’s tumultuous history and present-day conflict, but during a talk Tuesday at Harvard Hillel, Shavit focused on how to bridge the gap between American Jews and their homeland.
“I think it’s the role of the Jewish state and the Jewish leadership to try to seduce you into being Jewish, being proud to be Jewish,” Shavit said.
Shavit, a columnist at the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, spoke alongside Jeffrey M. Goldberg, a columnist for The Atlantic, who described Shavit as both a friend and a key critic of Israel’s occupation in the West Bank.
 
Throughout the discussion, Shavit grappled with what he characterized as the chasm growing between Israel and young American Jews.
“Now you have a situation in which...American Jewry is moving in more liberal, universal, assimilated directions,” Shavit said, adding that Israel is moving in the opposite direction.
Shavit’s current book tour across the U.S. is aimed at reaching out to young American Jews.
“There’s nothing more essential for the Jewish people and for the state of Israel than to restart the dialogue with you,” Shavit told the crowd. “I think one of the greatest failures of Israel in recent years is that it did not reach out to young American Jews, and now it’s the time to do it.”
Goldberg also spoke about the importance of reaching out to the Jewish youth in the United States.
“This is something that we talked about months ago, having Ari go to campuses and speak with young American Jews,” Goldberg said.
Though Shavit passed out copies of his book for free at the event, Peter B. Kussell ’67, who attended the talk, said he bought a copy of the book when it first came out and called it a “landmark” book about the state of Israel.
“I think he’s directing this towards what stake your generation has in Israel,” Kussell said.
Shavit’s and Goldberg’s discussion follows a speech at Hillel on Monday by former Israeli Major General Yaakov Amidror, who focused on the Israeli military.
“The real threat to Israel is the loss of the Jews,” Shavit said. “We don’t have an F-15 problem,” he added, referring to the Israeli Air Force.
However, both Shavit and Amidror said that Israel has done the best it can in a difficult situation.
“We are not perfect,” Shavit said. “We are not some marble statue of perfection, but not only are we human, we are an amazing human endeavor.”
Shavit also spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies on Tuesday.

Harvard’s political enthusiasts packed the floors of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday night to watch President Obama deliver his sixth State of the Union Address.
 
Tuesday’s annual viewing party for the President’s State of the Union Address was open to the public and co-sponsored by the Institute of Politics, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Harvard Republican Club.
 
In the address, Obama outlined some his policy priorities this year, including early and college education, unemployment, the economy, and strong but narrow military goals.
 
Reactions to the President’s speech from attendees at the viewing party varied. Dhruva Bhat  ’17, who hails from India, saw the State of the Union Address for the first time last night. He said he was glad he saw it for the first time at the IOP viewing party because he could watch it with members of different political parties and gauge their reactions.
 
For Tianhao He ’15, who has been involved with the IOP in the past, the JFK Jr. Forum was a great venue to hear the speech because it connected to a part of the speech’s message.
 
“The fact that the College hosts events like this is very important, because it encourages kids to have a passion for public service,” he said. “The speech is so powerful because it speaks about the need to have a passion for public service, caring about the problems affecting our country, and working together to find the solutions.”
 
 
Eva A. Guidarini ’15, president of the IOP, said that the event provides College students of all political affiliations a way to engage in a speech that is more fun than watching alone.
 
For example, in addition to watching the address together, attendees also engaged with the speech by playing a game of “phrase bingo” organized by members of the IOP. Each “bingo number” was a phrase frequently used by Obama, and participants crossed out phrases occurring in the speech as they listened. Those with filled boards were entered into a raffle for prizes.
 “It’s a great way to bring everyone back on campus and get everyone excited about politics and public service as we launch a new semester, especially going into a midterm election year,” Guidarini said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Students may no longer have to trek to the North End for hand-made cannoli from Mike’s Pastry, as the bakery is one step closer to opening at 11 Dunster St. after securing the support of the Harvard Square Advisory Committee Monday.
“They seemed very enthusiastic about having us there,” said Mike’s Pastry general manager Angelo Papa about the Monday night meeting with the Advisory Committee, which recommended that the Board of Zoning Appeal grant the pastry shop a fast-order food permit.  Papa is the stepson of Mike’s Pastry founder Michael Mercogliano.
On Thursday evening, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal will assemble to review Mike’s Pastry's request for a license and fast-order food permit. If the Board approves the request, construction of the new location at 11 Dunster St. can begin.
Everything in their space will be rebuilt, Papa said. The pastry shop will primarily serve takeout orders, but it will also have standing room and will house six counter seats for customers. Under current plans, the new location will open in late May or early June.
The menu will be similar to that of the North End location, featuring classics like cannoli and Italian pastries as well as other menu items such as croissants, muffins, turnovers, cappuccinos, and coffee.
Excitement about this addition to the Square is already brewing. Denise A. Jillson, Harvard Square Business Association executive director, said she has received numerous phone calls and emails about Mike’s Pastry.
“I think it’s lovely, really wonderful,” Jillson said. “We look forward to welcoming them to the Square.”
The family-run operation has done business on Hanover St. in Boston for more than 60 years, and the existing Mike’s Pastry shop will continue to remain open and serve cannoli in their signature blue-and-white pastry boxes.
Although Mike’s Pastry is expanding, Papa said that they will aim to stay true to their family-style business values and their mission of providing a quality experience.
“This is a new adventure. It’s the first time we’ve ever left the North End,” Papa said. “We’re a small business, we’re proud of what we do, and we love our customers.”

This spring, students will be able to explore the intersection of the humanities, technology, and design in two new humanities studio courses intended to combine traditional seminar teaching methods with hands-on studio work.
The two courses—Humanities Studio 1: "Cold Storage—An Interactive Documentary Project" and Humanities Studio 2: "Homeless Paintings of the Italian Renaissance: A Hands On Curatorial Experiment"—are among a series of new courses launched this spring that are not affiliated with a single department.
“We are part of this broad movement in the humanities, the digital humanities, in which researchers are applying new emerging kinds of research methods,” Matthew Battles, associate director of the the Harvard metaLAB, said. The metaLAB is a humanities research laboratory that includes faculty who are working with students in the studio courses.
Students in "Cold Storage" will focus on documenting and analyzing the Harvard Depository through video production and website design, while students in "Homeless Paintings of  the Italian Renaissance" will develop an animated archive of lost Renaissance paintings.
According to Jeffrey T. Schnapp, the professor of both new courses as well as faculty director for the metaLAB, the studio classes will be open to both undergraduate and graduate students.
“They aren’t courses that presuppose a set of skills or involve prerequisites,” Schnapps said. “I like to describe them as translational courses where you acquire a set of skills, you acquire knowledge, but right from the beginning you have to translate that knowledge into hands-on forms.”
Schnapp said 11 students shopped "Cold Storage" on its first day, Tuesday. Both courses will be capped at 18 students.
“It’s an experiment stage, to test the waters, see what works at the end of the experiment,” Schnapp said.
Battles said the courses will be graded on a letter scale and students will be evaluated primarily on class participation and projects.
“The grading will be based not on any particular fluency in Photoshop or Javascript, but rather with the ability to come to grips with new materials, to identify problems, analyze those problems,” Battles said.
Both studio courses have been approved and financed under the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, an initiative to promote innovative teaching methods.
According to Battles, the studio courses will provide fluid interdisciplinary curriculum that meets the aims of HILT and will accommodate changing teaching methods.
“We’re in the midst of rapid change, changes in educational experience and participation, changes in institutional forms, and changes in technology,” Battles said, noting that the structure of the new courses is yet another progression in teaching methods.

More than 28,000 students from 183 countries have enrolled in HDS1544.1x: “Early Christianity: The Letters of Paul,” Harvard Divinity School’s first foray into edX, which launched Jan. 6—a figure more than 220 times the size of the school’s 2013 graduating class.
The course, christened “BibleX” by the media and taught by Divinity School professor Laura S. Nasrallah, examines the political and religious context of Paul’s letters and the lasting impact that the letters have had on modern religious debate.
The course consists of video lectures, annotation assignments, online discussions, and other short videos that help students gain a glimpse into the historical world Paul occupied and the controversies, both ancient and new, that surround his letters.
“One of my goals was to really engage in this new online learning,” said Nasrallah, an expert on the New Testament and early Christianity. “I think a lot of people are really curious about the Bible and ancient history,” she added.
Tyler M. Schwaller, a Ph.D. candidate at the Divinity School who helps staff the course, said that he did not initially expect the amount of attention that the course would receive from the public.
“I thought there was potential for a few thousand people,” Schwaller said.
Sergiy O. Nesterko, a HarvardX research fellow, said that the course’s success was doubly impressive given that humanities courses usually attract fewer registrants on the platform than science or technical courses. Harvard has offered a handful of humanities courses on the platform since it co-founded edX with MIT in May 2012.
“The subject of the course contributed to the level of popularity of the course,” said Nesterko, adding later, “It’s a very wide reach, but I wouldn’t say it is atypical for any HarvardX courses. These courses generally attract registrants from many different countries from around the world.”
The course makes use not only of discussion platforms through HarvardX, but also uses Facebook to promote debate between all class participants. Nasrallah also encourages students to use the website Poetry Genius to annotate texts of Paul’s letters.
Unlike some other HarvardX courses, there is no residential equivalent of “The Letters of Paul” this semester.
Both Schwaller and Nasrallah said that the course has attracted students from religious and non-religious backgrounds.
“We know the ways in which the religious subjects we study can really spark a passionate debate,” Nasrallah said.
While Schwaller and Nasrallah are not sure whether they will offer more courses through HarvardX in the future, both agree that creating an online course has improved their teaching skills.
“[The course] helps me think more broadly about different ways to teach,” said Schwaller.

Heather P. Campion, a member of the Institute of Politics' Senior Advisory Committee and former director of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, was named the first female CEO of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation Tuesday. Campion, who has been serving on the Kennedy Foundation’s Board of Directors since 2003, will assume the new position March 3.
In her new post, Campion will spearhead the drive to digitize the library’s archives and modernize the exhibits in the library by making it more hands-on and high-tech, according to a press release from the library. With these projects, the J.F.K. Library is hoping to engage with a wider audience and encourage more people to explore the Kennedy era. She also plans on continuing the Kennedy Foundation’s mission to promote the legacy of President Kennedy and connect his visions to current problems.
The IOP and the Kennedy Foundation have a history of working closely on many projects, including a joint creation of the New Frontier Awards in 2004 to honor young Americans with commitment to public service. The IOP plans on building upon its close connection with the Kennedy Foundation with Campion in charge.
“I'm really excited about working with her in this new capacity,” IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson '94 wrote in an email. “She will be an outstanding leader of the Library Foundation.”
Since joining the Harvard Kennedy School in 1981, Campion helped build the School’s Center for Business and Government and held positions including Director of the Public Liaison office and Associate Director of the IOP, in addition to Forum Director.
Outside of the Kennedy School, Campion was an executive at Citizens Financial Group, Inc. from 1998 to 2007 and most recently served as Chief Administrative Officer of Northeast Bancorp from 2010 to 2013. Before that, Campion was a member of the White House staff in the Speechwriting Office and the Office of Public Liaison during the Carter Administration and worked on presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988.
Colleagues of Campion described her as a dedicated and enthusiastic worker.
“Heather has more energy than anybody you will meet,” said Catherine McLaughlin, Executive Director of the IOP.
Grayson, who was a student at the College when Campion directed the Forum, credits Campion for helping interest him in the IOP as a career.
“Probably safe to say that without her efforts, I probably wouldn't have been as involved with the IOP,” Grayson said. “She encouraged student involvement in all aspects of the Forum.”

CORRECTION: Jan. 30, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified where current IOP Director C.M. Trey Grayson ’94 was a student when he first interacted with Campion in her capacity as director of the Forum. In fact, Grayson was a student at the College, not at the Kennedy School of Government at the time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael G. Ignatieff—a Harvard Kennedy School professor and the former leader of Canada’s Liberal Party—discussed his highly personal reasons for pursuing high office in his home country during a speech at the Harvard Book Store Wednesday.
“I don’t apologize for the raw, naked, unbridled ambition that drove me to do it,” said Ignatieff, who argued that such ambition was necessary to make it through the brutal political landscape.
Ignatieff held the event to talk about his recent book, “Fire and Ashes: Success and Failure in Politics.”
Ignatieff left the Kennedy School in 2005 to run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a member of the Liberal Party and rose to leader of the party and leader of the Official Opposition before losing his seat in the 2011 federal elections after his party’s worst showing in history.
Ignatieff’s book details his ascension to power in the Liberal Party, where he sat poised to become prime minister, as well as his failures and “naivete” in office.
After leaving Harvard, Ignatieff found a world where “you have to fight for your standing, you have to fight to be heard at all,” he said.
He went on to describe the political sphere as a tough place for even the most confident and hardened politician.
“You have to have a crazy idealism to get you through the tough parts,” he said. “You have to put it all on the line—lives, their careers, everything.”
When asked if he wanted to be prime minister, Ignatieff answered without pausing, “Yes.”
“[The party] told me I could be prime minister.... I went into it entirely for myself, no doubt about it,” said Ignatieff, who also served as the director of the Carr Center for Human Rights before turning his attention to politics.
Instead, he argued that such ambition was needed just to draw people into politics. “If you knew what you were in for before you went into politics, no one would do it,” Ignatieff said.
Yet Ignatieff said that people should aspire to the highest political offices. He decided to write the book, he said, for those who looked at his political career and said, “ 'he didn’t quite get there, but I will.' ”
According to Ignatieff, his book details his political mistakes and misunderstandings—“here are a few things you really have to know” about political life, he said.
After leaving Canada to pursue his Ph.D. in history at Harvard in the 1970s, Ignatieff worked as a freelance writer in London before coming in 2000 to join the faculty at the Kennedy School, which proved to be a point of contention in Canada.
“It’s painful to be told you don’t belong,” he said, recounting crowds who greeted his return to Canada and the declaration of his candidacy for parliament with signs that read, “go home."
“He has been extremely honest,” said Gaurav Keerthi, a Kennedy School student enrolled in Ignatieff’s class. “It takes a certain type of courage to be that frank in your failure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Romanian Ministry of Justice has accused Dragos Lipan Secu of accepting bribes and laundering money while he was employed as a contractor for Scolopax, a Harvard-owned timber company in Romania.
According to a statement issued by the Romanian Anti-Corruption Department on Jan. 21, Secu allegedly conspired with timber sellers to purchase timberland on behalf of Scolopax for artificially high prices. In return, he received a series of bribes from the sellers, including 4.45 million lei, or $1.3 million, a trip to the Canary Islands in 2007, and a Chrysler Sebring car.
Secu’s wife has also been arrested for complicity, according to the statement. Bloomberg News reported that the couple could face a sentence of more than 10 years in prison.
Scolopax is wholly owned by Phemus Corporation, a subsidiary of the Harvard Management Company that invests on its behalf. According to University tax filings, Scolopax had assets of over $126 million in 2011. Phemus Corporation’s assets totaled more than $4.2 billion in 2012, the last year for which information is publicly available.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said that Secu’s relationship with Scolopax and the University ended in December 2012. The alleged transactions occurred between 2007 and 2009.
“This matter pertains to actions of an outside contractor who is no longer associated with Harvard Management Company,” Galvin wrote in an emailed statement. “We are aware of the allegations and gathering further information.”
Sam F. Wohns ’14, a member of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, said that the allegations demonstrate the need for Harvard to more vigilantly monitor its investments and subsidiaries.
“I think that this is a clear example where Harvard’s inadequate oversight of its investments has led to not only connection to illegal business activity but has also hurt our bottom line,” Wohns said. “It’s a great illustration of what’s at stake when Harvard fails to adequately ensure that its companies are operating according to the law and upholding Harvard values.”
Other Harvard-owned natural resource companies have come under scrutiny in the past few months. In October, a California-based think tank, the Oakland Institute, and Responsible Investment issued a report alleging that Harvard’s timberland holdings in Argentina have caused environmental damage.
Harvard began investing in timber in 1997, according to a Bloomberg News article. As of 2012, about 10 percent of Harvard’s portfolio was invested in natural resources—including timberland—in countries like Brazil and Romania.
Returns on Harvard’s endowment in 2013 trailed the national average, according to a recent study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund Institute. HMC’s investments in natural resources saw total returns of 5.1 percent, falling short of its own internally set benchmark goal of 7.6 percent. Of all the asset classes detailed in the the University’s fiscal year 2013 financial report, natural resources fell short of the benchmark by the largest margin.

In the latest installment of the crosstown rivalry between the Harvard and Boston University wrestling teams, the second half of the Crimson lineup strung together four consecutive wins to lead the team to a 23-15 dual meet victory, its second in four games, at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday.
The comeback may have been a team effort, but no match was more crucial than junior co-captain James Fox’s first period pin of BU’s Kristian Meyer in the penultimate battle of the day.
With Harvard trailing, 15-14, to the Terriers, Fox knew the importance of his match.
With the heavyweight bout on deck, the two-time NCAA qualifier believed he had to not only win, but also dominate.
After losing four of the first six matches of the day, Harvard found itself behind, 15-6, with only four bouts remaining in the match. The lightweights struggled against a tough BU core led by No. 8 Nestor Taffur, giving up three major decisions.
None of the Crimson lightweights were pinned, however, and they kept the match within reach. And in dominant fashion—punctuated by the performance of Fox—Harvard’s heavyweights stormed back and took control of the match for good.
Freshman 174-pounder Eric Morris and co-captain 187-pounder Cameron Croy both picked up major decisions, 11-0 and 16-5, respectively, to bring the Crimson back into the match with two bouts to go.
Down just one point in the team score, it was now Fox’s turn.
“We knew [coming in] our upper weights would have to get major points because the lower weights were going to have a tough time against BU,” Fox said. “I told myself I needed a major here.”
Fox did just that. After taking down Meyer twice seemingly at will in the first period, he was able to sink in a deep hammerlock.
After nearly going out of bounds in the process of turning the Terrier, the 197-pounder kept one foot inbounds and dragged his opponent back into the ring.
Fox finished Meyer off by earning a quick pin with five seconds left in the period, igniting huge applause from both his team and the near-capacity MAC.
“I [thought] I had to get this guy in and settle down,” Fox said. “Last week I got in a similar position and couldn’t finish. After the match, I talked to my mom and she [said], ‘You need to settle.’”
The advice worked, and the pin gave Harvard a commanding 20-15 lead going into the last match. Sophomore heavyweight Nick Gajdzik was thankful for the cushion.
“Gajdzik came up to me after and [told me], ‘thanks for putting that out of reach,’” Fox said.
In his previous match at 197 lbs., one week ago against No. 6 Cornell, Fox was one of two Crimson wrestlers to earn victories against the Big Red. But while Fox had the opportunity to pin his opponent, he was unable to notch the decisive fall.
He secured that pin this time around. Indeed, Fox’s eighth victory of the season gave his team much-needed momentum heading into the final matchup of the afternoon.
“Fox is an amazing wrestler,” Gajdzik said. “His pin was huge. It gave us six points in the team score, so when I went out there to wrestle, I basically had to not get pinned.”
Even though he only had to avoid a pin for Harvard to win the dual meet, the heavyweight pulled off an overtime decision, 3-1, against BU senior Kevin Innis.
After grinding out three periods, the match was tied, 1-1, going into overtime.
Gajdzik countered a quick shot from Innis and got behind for a match-winning takedown.
“The guy I wrestled was a really solid wrestler,” Gajdzik said. “The mentality I tried to go out with is [that] every match is winnable. You have to wrestle your match.”
The Crimson will hold the Charles Cup, the trophy awarded to the victor of the rivalry for the foreseeable future, as Boston University’s wrestling program, which currently sits four games below .500, was cut for next season to free up funding for other programs.
After losing the cup for three straight years, Harvard has most recently won it in back-to-back seasons.
“BU is one of our rivals, and we battle for the Charles Cup,” said Fox. “Since wrestling is getting cut, we wanted to win the final Cup.”
In addition to the hardware, the victory has given the Crimson confidence as the team heads towards the meat of its schedule. Harvard is now 3-4 in dual meets after posting an 8-5 record last year.
“This win is huge. BU is a very good team, and I think it legitimizes what we are doing,” Gajdzik said. “That’s the kind of energy we need to push us forward for the rest of the season. It showed that we are going to be ready for the postseason.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I have to say that we’ve both been pretty lucky,” said Alex Velez-Green, a Harvard College senior. “We know a guy in Nairobi who had to spend two weeks in a hospital because someone beat him up.”
On the diverse and lengthy list of Harvard students’ worries, getting assaulted in Kenya generally doesn’t rank very high. But not many students also worry about how they’re going to traverse a continent in the span of a semester. Velez-Green and fellow senior Nathan Clement, formerly of the men’s water polo team, had to do just that, as they decided the summer before their senior year to put off their last fall semester to travel from Cairo, Egypt to Cape Town, South Africa.
Velez-Green had past experience abroad and was always interested in other countries. The same could not be said for his roommate, however. In his freshman year, an undaunted Nathan Clement decided to walk on to the Harvard water polo team. Despite contributing only lightly to the squad during his first two years, by his junior season Clement began to get some playing time and eventually even earned a “Major H” award.
But near the end of his junior year, Clement dislocated his shoulder. Full recovery, if possible, would have taken months of therapy, so he made the difficult decision to leave the team.
With increased time at his hands, Clement decided to travel with Velez-Green during the fall semester, embarking on a journey across an entire continent.
FIRST STEPS
The idea to make this trek was first born while Velez-Green was recovering from a tonsillectomy.
“By the end of the year, I wanted to get abroad again,” Velez-Green said. “It’s a completely different experience, and I saw all my friends going abroad for junior spring, and I was so jealous.… I wanted to take the opportunity because especially after you graduate, traveling would become a lot more difficult.”
With the itch to travel, Velez-Green eventually resolved to go from Cairo, a location with which he had familiarity, to Cape Town. The vast majority of the journey would be a completely new experience for the Harvard student.
Before Velez-Green took off, Clement decided to join in on the expedition.
“I’ve never done any travel except for Canada and Mexico, so when Alex said he was planning a trip, I said, ‘Hey, why not,’” Clement said. “Especially since I will probably not have an opportunity to travel once I get a job, it just felt like the perfect time, and there wasn’t anything really stopping me.”
Velez-Green and Clement officially touched down in Cairo on Aug. 22, and they were quickly reminded that Egypt remained in a state of revolution.
From their ride from the airport to their hostel, the roommates were stopped at checkpoints by soldiers bearing AK-47s, and they explored the city with cautious and curious eyes.
Velez-Green and Clement proceeded to travel from Cairo to Alexandria, where through a group of friends Velez-Green was able to experience a dream of his: riding a customized motorcycle, complete with blaring speakers and flashing, multi-color lights, throughout the streets of Alexandria.
BAD FORTUNE…AND GOOD LUCK
One day in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Velez-Green and Clement attempted to take a taxi to one of their destinations. After being told that a taxi should only cost six birr, the Ethiopian unit of currency, the duo agreed to pay the taxi driver 20 birr, and left the car after arriving at the location, thinking that all was well.
Instead, the driver demanded that they pay 150 birr, following the students and latching onto Clement’s backpack. As locals tried to mediate the argument, the duo decided to pay the driver 100 birr to end the discussion. Although the disagreement was settled, there was still a sour taste in their mouths.
That experience did not characterize the whole of the experience in Addis Ababa, however. At 4 am, the duo along with their Australian friend, Yanush, went to a muddy and rundown public bus stop with people everywhere. The three were at a lost as to what to do, but a man volunteered to take their money and purchase the tickets for them.
“We really had no choice if we wanted to get anywhere,” Velez-Green said. “We gave him the money, and I told Yanush to stay next to the guy, and I got behind him if he started running.”
Luckily enough, the man procured the three tickets for Yanush, Velez-Green, and Clement, while refusing to accept any payment for his services.
“Out of nowhere, by a crack of luck, he got us where we had to go, and he didn’t ask for anything,” Velez-Green said. “That has happened so many times on our trip. I’ve learned that if things are grim, you just have to roll with it, and especially smile at people.”
KILL’EM-MANJARO
After enduring an overcrowded, twelve-hour bus ride through the Semien Mountains, feeding hyenas, and going on a safari, one of the duo’s biggest tasks was to climb Kilimanjaro. Despite feeling ill in the days leading up to the climb, Velez-Green was determined to complete the climb and not give up.
“You start the final ascent at around midnight to make it at sunrise,” Velez-Green said. “[It] was okay for a while, but I guess halfway through, the headache got much worse, and then you get this overwhelming feeling that you have to sleep…. You’re just so groggy, and your mind can’t really focus at all. It became increasingly difficult even to walk.”
“Alex was no longer walking anymore,” Clement added. “He was just stumbling along. It looked like he was walking upstream through a really, really heavy current.”
At his weakest moments during the hike, Velez-Green was rendered unable to move. Sitting on a rock, he mumbled about how he could not feel his hands anymore and how the numbness was seeping higher up into his arms and legs.
“The guides were worried, and then they took off their own jackets and put them on Alex, and then he started feeling better,” Clement said.
Despite his illness, Velez-Green was determined to reach the top. He told himself that as long as he put one foot in front of the other, he’d eventually make it up there—and he did.
DANGER AND WORRIES
Despite the hazardous experiences that Velez-Green and Clement had through the trip, the journey was still safer than it could have been.
“We’ve both been scammed, but we haven’t been mugged,” Velez-Green said.
In addition, despite the prospect of danger, the two were most worried about their budget entering the trip. Including airfare, a safari, and climbing Kilimanjaro, the two have spent roughly $6,000 apiece, which they consider to be pretty cheap.
“We’re being careful not going to super expensive places, but we’re eating well and not starving ourselves,” Clement said.
“What I love about traveling is finding the local joints,” Velez-Green added. “If you’re doing it right, you can go to [inexpensive] places…. You have to be creative with how you have fun.”
END POINT
Throughout the trip, Velez-Green and Clement have enjoyed remarkable timing, as they entered Egypt during the end of the revolution and touched down in South Africa only a few days before the passing of Nelson Mandela.
In this final location, Velez-Green and Clement were lent a unique perspective and observed firsthand how a nation mourned—in a slightly different manner than may be expected—one of the world’s most influential leaders.
“The atmosphere at those services was remarkably [upbeat],” Velez-Green said. “More people were dancing and singing than crying. People grieve in different ways. At least the people I saw that were grieving by celebrating. There were a lot of feelings that he was the best thing that happened in the last few decades.”
Now that Velez-Green and Clement have reached Cape Town, they will both be leaving Africa shortly. The two have gained a multitude of experiences from the journey and learned a variety of lessons, and the takeaways are applicable to all aspects of life.
“I think that one thing that made our trip really cool was that we were extremely willing to change our plans,” Clement said. “So be flexible.”
