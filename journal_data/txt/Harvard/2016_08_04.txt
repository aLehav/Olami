After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adam Haslett’s third book, “Imagine Me Gone,” expands on the notion of depression first evoked in “You Are Not A Stranger Here,” the acclaimed collection of short stories that brought Haslett Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award nominations. Building upon his first work, in which the short story “War’s End” deals with a man depressed to the point of suicide, Haslett expands upon depression and its detrimental effects in the novel-length tale that the subject warrants. The book follows a family of five as they struggle to fight the mental illness plaguing the patriarch, John, as well as his eldest son, Michael. Margaret, John’s wife, and their other two children, Celia and Alec, can only watch in horror and desperately try to keep from succumbing to the disease that haunts them. In “Imagine Me Gone,” Haslett surpasses himself in his second exploration of the subject through his multifaceted depictions of depression and its effects on both victims and witnesses of the disease, reaffirming himself as an improved, matured writer.
Throughout, Haslett deftly explores the many different shapes and forms that depression can take within the minds of the father and son at the core of the novel. Though Margaret marries him knowing of his condition, the apparent dormancy of John’s illness appeases her—until catastrophe falls upon the family when it resurfaces decades later, bringing with it debt and resentment engendered by the passive, barely responsive state in which his compromised mental health leaves him. A “monster [that] has its funnel driven into the back of your head and is sucking the light coming through your eyes straight out of you into the mouth of oblivion” constantly challenges John’s sanity. Through his meticulously chosen metaphors, Haslett paints a intricate picture that immediately gives the reader a harrowing sense of what depression is like.
Haslett’s strength lies in encapsulating the darkness that enshrouds the main characters’ brains by making tangible the hopelessness that depression often induces in its victims. One character explains, “There is no getting better. There is love I cannot bear, which has kept me from drifting entirely loose. There are the medicines I can take that flood my mind without discrimination, slowing the monster, moving the struggle underwater, where I then must live in the murk. But there is no killing the beast.” Haslett further demystifies the stigmatised disorder by representing its manifestation as entirely different in Michael. Whereas John’s “mind closes down… [and] goes into a sort of hibernation,” Michael’s by contrast goes into an overwhelming overdrive that threatens to slowly kill not only him but also his family, who has to watch helplessly as he wastes his life away.
Indeed, Haslett breaks from the archetype of the depressed sad sap by making Michael a riveting character who defies the stereotypes associated with depression. He is haunted not only by the dark shadow of his mental health but also by his privilege as a white man and by the music he obsessively listens to. He studies African culture, history, and sociology to try to understand a group of people from whom he could not be more different. His love interests are all black women who turn out to be lesbians, women for whom he has “the desire to physically reverse racial privilege by becoming [their] slave.” This characterization depicts how the depressed are not ruled by their disorders;  instead, depression just adds another dimension to who they are. Michael is an eclectic amalgam of characteristics that are altogether as erratic as his mind. For example, in an earlier scene in the novel, he reminisces as a young teenager in a letter to his aunt about a rendition of Donna Summer’s “On the Radio”: “Its opening piano and strings have always hovered between LA session-music shmaltz and the prelude to a tragedy, only to be redeemed by the purity of her voice in that first verse.” Though this level of musical insight is unrealistic for such a young man—the language used during Michael’s younger years is rendered much more in Haslett’s voice than in his character’s—his quirkiness and undeniable sincerity set him apart from the usual image of the depressed person.
Spanning decades, from the beginning of John and Margaret’s relationship to the realization of their children’s adult lives, the evolution of the main characters as they grow and deal with their respective situations reflects Haslett’s growth as a writer. Just as his characters evolve to learn what it really mean to love your family in spite of an omnipresent and draining spirit, Haslett’s writing has matured in this accurate representation of the struggle with depression. Gone are the days of dark fiction from his earlier works; now Haslett incorporates comedic reprieves, particularly through Michael, to lighten the burden of hardship depression undoubtedly represents. “...I was selected by the Department of Education to voyage on their first Student Loan Probe to Jupiter, as one of four debitnauts. We traveled for years, passing through nebulae of internships and retail, through the wake of an imploding technology boom, and on through the outer rings of bankruptcy… Our hope was to make contact with the lost colony of the underemployed,” he narrates in a request for forbearance. Despite his troubled mind, his wry sense of humor shines through and endears him to the hearts of readers, adding yet another layer to the complex character of Michael.
From John to Michael, from Margaret to Celia and Alec, Haslett’s novel is the tale of how depression in its myriad forms affects people in different ways—especially those who don’t suffer from it, as they become instead the helpless bystanders forced to witness its soul-crushing power in action. Haslett’s authorial evolution is evident in the maturity with which he explores depression and its different iterations, in the variety of his cast of characters, and in the complex incorporation of comedy into an otherwise serious story. He may have written about the topic already in his first book, but “Imagine Me Gone” paints a brand new, innovative picture of depression that demands to be felt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Take a high concept restaurant scene. Add a magical knife. Throw in a healthy serving of patriarchal villains and strong female protagonists, and you have the recipe that Jeremy P. Bushnell concocted for his latest novel, “The Insides.” A professor at Northeastern University, Bushnell made his authorial debut in 2014 with “The Weirdness,” which satirized the New York literary world to much praise. His most recent work carries on his signature blend of magical realism with sharp wit; The Crimson sat down with Bushnell to talk about his new book and his creative experiences.
The Harvard Crimson: Why did you decide to write and publish books?
Jeremy P. Bushnell: Well, that’s been something I wanted to do for a long time. Ever since I was, like, a little kid, I had an identity where writing and creative stuff was important to me. When I was real little, I used to make comic books that... you would call “fan fiction” nowadays. They were based on a Japanese television show character called Ultraman. Seeing “Ultraman,” I really loved it, so I started making my own comics and telling my own stories about the Ultraman characters.... I also remember that I had sold one of his comic books to a neighbor… so early on, I was not just creating, but I sort of wanted to be in the marketplace. I gradually got more serious about it and learned about the industry and the way that it worked and what it meant to do a career. It was all kind of a continuum from there, I guess.
THC: What has your experience of the writing industry been like?
JPB: I teach a course over at Northeastern that is about the publishing industry and how writers make their way around it, and it’s an interesting learning process that you figure out as you go along. I teach that course to help students through that part of [being a writer] because there’s a lot of schooling about writing. You learn a lot about the craft, but you learn less about the way that publishing works as a business. I majored in English with a concentration in writing. I did graduate school at the MFA. But it was only after that [schooling] that I figured out how the industry worked. I was lucky enough to get an agent that was desirable… [and who] represented me for an earlier book, which we didn’t have success [with]. That was an interesting learning experience right there. It was more of an experimental book with more of a sort of cerebral narrative. When my agent took it, he said flat out, “I’ll represent this book but I don’t think I can sell it.” So I did some more research [about] trends in the marketplace and… tried to emulate those aspects in my book to make it more market friendly.
THC: You mentioned that you teach a course at Northeastern. You’re also a fiction editor for Longform.org, a lead developer for a game, and, as you said, a professor. How do these eclectic roles affect your writing?
JPB: I really think that in some ways, working as a game designer and a teacher of writing both emphasized something to me in my creative work—which is that the revision process is very important. As a teacher of writing, I always encourage students to do first an outline and then an early draft and then a rough draft and then a final draft. I encourage students to go through this process of multiple drafting and explain that your paper gets better with each draft. I was able to teach that easily, but I still had a sort of a blind spot against it in my own work. I still kind of liked to write a draft and make a very light revision and then be done of it and put it away. And I think that was a mistake, and it took me some to figure that out. Designing a game was really helpful with that. When you’re designing a board game… you make these sort of complex systems but you don’t know how they are going to play out. So you have people play test them and the… first version of your game always sucks. They’ll play it, and it’s no fun, and you have to make tweaks and changes.... But then people find a loophole, so you have to close the loophole. So working on a game, I just iterated [the game] hundreds of times, and each time I could see that the game was getting more fun…. [Learning to revise] was kind of the final big creative hurdle for me… and I think my work in other fields really helped me with that.
THC: Turning to your stories themselves, what made you chose a high-concept restaurant scene for “The Insides”?
JPB: I had done this previous book, “The Weirdness,” which was about the literary scene. And I didn’t want to stay in that territory, so I was looking around for some other scene that was right for parody. And I thought, well, the New York food world is definitely a world that could be easily satirized…. As it ended up, I did less satire than I had initially intended. The new book is little more serious and a little more weighty in terms of its themes, but I had sort of chosen the milieu and kind of wanted to stick with it.
THC: I also noticed that your protagonists, Maja and Ollie, are both female.
JPB: My first book was normal for me—like white male, young guy protagonist…. [So] there was a part of me that just creatively wanted to branch out and try writing a different type of characters. I consider myself to be a feminist writer, and I think it’s important to have stories where heroes are women, both written by women and men as well. I think it’s worth telling these kinds of stories…. On another level, the story is sort of about struggles around power, about how people who are more powerful kind of exploit and do harm to people who are more marginalized…. This book is about patriarchy. The villains are a father and son team looking to gain power against others. It’s literally a book about patriarchy. And I figured, if your antagonist in your book is a group of evil patriarchs, it probably makes sense to counter them with a protagonist who is a young woman. So I put those forces in battle with one another.
THC: What made you settle on such weighty themes?
JPB:  Those are the themes that I think about in my daily life. I spend a fair amount of time reading progressive writers and thinking about progressive politics…. I think someone can read my novels without looking for political context and still enjoy it... but I just think about these issues and want them to surface in the writing. Also, in some ways this is a book about loss and the sadness that people keep. The title, “The Insides,” which in the book refers to a magical realm… [is] also about what’s deep inside of us—sort of about wounds and painful memories that we hold onto and stuff down inside of ourselves. The book is real concerned with how you process those things and deal with mistakes in the past…. This book asks, if there’s shortcut to erase those mistakes or change things in some way, would you do it? That’s an interesting question, but it does make for a book with some deeper emotional resonance.
THC: Why do you choose to blend genres and employ magical realism in your stories?
JPB: I mean, that’s a choice that’s reflective of my habits as a reader. I read all kinds of stuff, from pretty heavy theory to kind of real silly, trashy comic books to junk sci-fi to stuff that’s listed like literary to fantasy. And it’s all sort of genre-hopped in my reading, and I view them all as pools to draw from…. To me, it’s not like I’m making a conscious choice to genre-swap. I just kind of write about what I want to write about, and it tends to be somewhat comic, somewhat horrific, and somewhat realistic.
THC: What’s it been like to get so much praise and acclaim for your stories?
JPB: I would like to have more complicated answer about it, but it feels good to put something out there and to see that it’s resonating with people…. With this book, obviously some things were hard. As a white male writer writing a protagonist who is a woman of mixed race, there’s some concern of, like, “Did I do that right?” If you get the notes wrong, there’s more danger there…. And some of the reviewers who were women of color spoke to the fact that it resonated with their experience, and that was hugely important with me. I think that if you’re going to make the choice to tell a story that hasn’t been your own, you have a real responsibility to try to get it right and do your homework about it and make sure that it rings true to those readers as well. So I’ve been happy to see that [many critics] seem to feel that aspect of it came out well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: August 5, 2016 at 9:49 a.m.
Jeff Neal, a top University spokesperson, left his position at Harvard Public Affairs and Communications in late July after seven years of guiding Harvard’s media strategy and representing a number of its leaders.
Neal, who joined HPAC in 2009, said he intends to take a six-month sabbatical to work on a writing project and will not seek another full-time position until 2017 at the earliest. HPAC has not named Neal’s replacement, and an online posting for a Assistant Vice President of Communications remains open.
“Whatever the future might hold, I am happily embarking upon a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to focus on a few things for which I otherwise have far too little time and to be very thoughtful in deciding my future career path,” Neal wrote.
Since 2014, Neal had managed the media presence of University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and other members of Harvard’s central administration, penning press releases and sitting in on interviews with reporters. Previously, Neal was the primary spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, where he was tasked with shepherding the Faculty through the intense media scrutiny that accompanied revelations of a widespread cheating scandal in 2012.
A Texas native, Neal previously served as the chief spokesperson for the governor of Rhode Island.
“Jeff played a vital role advancing awareness of Harvard faculty research and the University’s commitment to financial aid and expanding access first at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and most recently as part of the University’s central communications team,” said Paul Andrew, Harvard's Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications. “We thank him for his seven years of service and wish him well in his future endeavors.”
