After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From a mere glance at the titles of her two novels—”Secret Daughter” and “The Golden Son”—Shilpi Somaya Gowda’s obsession with the familial becomes apparent.  Born and raised in Toronto by Indian expats, Gowda’s literary work is an attempt not only to connect with her homelands (emphasis on the plural), but also to capture the complicated coexistence of conflicting forces. In “The Golden Son,” Gowda focuses on the conflict between familial expectations and the ambiguity of youth, as well as the subtly unnerving tensions that populate the cross-cultural experience. While Gowda strongly delineates her plot and develops her main characters well, the triteness of her language and flatness of her characters often detract from the overarching themes of the novel.
Twenty-something Anil Patel is the titular “Golden Son.” After his father pays for a girl’s life-changing cleft palate surgery, Anil decides to pursue a career in medicine, leaving behind his bucolic existence for the frenetic pace of medical residency in Dallas, Texas. While his future is hazy, Anil’s present is no less uncertain, as he leaves behind an ailing father and a precarious family estate.  Meanwhile, Anil’s childhood friend, Leena, is thrust into an arranged marriage with a man she has never met. The alternating duet of Anil and Leena’s stories creates a kaleidoscopic narrative that is rich with insights on Indian and American culture.
Gowda deftly explores this theme without overdramatizing Patel’s struggles. Instead of inundating the reader with endless tragedy, Gowda presents well-curated glimpses into Anil’s daily life, such as his difficulty finding vegetarian foods in the hospital, for one. Even as Anil begins to adjust to American life, his surprise at such prosaic things as iced tea and karaoke are Gowda’s ways of reminding the reader of the struggle of assimilation.
In Gowda’s exploration of culture, marriage is a constant theme. Through his roommates’ romantic entanglements—and eventually his own—Anil explores the paradigm of the proper. Instead of the quiet Indian housewife his parents envision, Anil becomes involved with Amber, an archetypal girl-next-door. Gowda’s technique of exploring cultural differences through marriage is theoretically valid, but her execution is often overdone: The first time Anil visits Amber’s family, they invite him to go hunting in the backcountry. Such a technique often undermines the subtlety that Gowda aims for, instead leaving the reader in a wake of cliches as stifling as the Texas sun.
The title of the book is emblematic of Gowda’s linguistic weakness. She opts for a play on words neither clever nor original enough to sustain the meaning that Gowda places on it. This triteness recurs again and again, especially in romantic relationships: “Amber had been his first kiss, her first sexual experience and his first girlfriend. Now, he knew, she would also be his first heartbreak.” Better yet: “the scent of her was tantalizing.” And still more stale: “he was a dweller of two lands, accepted by none.” And yet, Gowda also manages to draw beautiful material from the mundane with phrases like “the unswallowed pill of regret settling in his throat.”
Gowda’s description of Anil’s father’s shrine provides another unexpected moment of depth: “It was not one of the photos taken shortly before his death, when his face was sunken and his eyes held a look of defeat. Nor had she chosen, as some widows did, a picture from his youth, in which he looked more like a movie star than the man she woke up next to every  morning. Mina had selected a picture of Jayant in his early forties, in the prime of his health and life.” In this paragraph, Anil’s mother, formerly the unmitigated force of tradition, gains a believably human dimension.
However, not all the characters receive such well-crafted descriptions; many stagnate in their one-dimensional forms. Neither Anil nor Leena have any glaring flaws or any inner strengths that can be developed throughout the novel. The weak descriptions of Anil and Leena often translate into anemic supporting characters, as Gowda turns to formulaic constructions in order to fill in the novel: the conservative mother, the harsh professor, even the jocular Australian. Perhaps the most convincing supporting characters are Texas and India, as the contrast between the two makes for some of the more gripping dialogues in the novel. Overall, instead of an interestingly jagged surface of idiosyncrasies, Gowda’s characters represent a smoothly perfect sheen. They are solid, but also hollow, and the book eventually relies more on plot than human depth to create interest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than eight minutes left in the Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s game against New Hampshire, co-captain Audrey Todd found the back of the net to extend the Crimson’s lead to 12-5. The senior’s third goal of the game seemed to all but wrap up the contest.
The Wildcats did not go down without a fight, however, staging a late game comeback that saw Harvard’s lead dwindle to two with less than a minute remaining. But ultimately, the Crimson (4-1, 1-0 Ivy) held off the late-game comeback on Saturday at Jordan Field to defeat UNH (2-5), 12-11.
“We collapsed at the end, but I credit UNH on their fight and not giving up,” junior attacker Marisa Romeo said. “We had a really balanced scoring attack with a lot of assisted goals which is really good.”
After a low scoring first half on both sides, the Harvard offense came out firing on all cylinders offensively in the second half. The Crimson started the half with an onslaught of scores, staging a 7-3 run to push its two-goal halftime lead to six. Sophomore attacker Eliza Guild and senior midfielder Alexis Nicolia netted two goals each, while freshman midfielder Keeley MacAfee recorded a score for Harvard as well.
With 7:36 left in the game, the offense seemed to have put the game out of reach for the visiting Wildcats. However, the effort of New Hampshire sophomore Krissy Schafer did not allow for the Crimson to cruise to victory, recording a hat trick in the final eight minutes of the game, part of an UNH 6-0 run that pulled New Hampshire within one with nine seconds remaining. But the Wildcats were unable to find a last-second goal in the closing seconds, as Sophomore midfielder Julia Glynn won the draw, all but securing the win for Harvard.
“You always have to expect a team to fight back. It came down to scrappy ground balls and draw controls at the end,” Glynn said.
Harvard won the groundball battle with 15-10 advantage over the Wildcats, while New Hampshire won the advantage in  draw control 15-12.
The scoring started off slow for both squads, with UNH holding a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes of play. Glynn finally opened the scoring for the Crimson with her ninth for the season more than 11 minutes into the tilt.
Harvard went on to take the lead against the Wildcats after a pair of assisted goals from junior attacker Maeve McMahon and another goal from junior attacker Marisa Romeo. Romeo leads the team in goals having found the back of the net 11 times so far this season.
Todd was critical in the win on Saturday, scoring a hat trick. The co-captain’s three scores was her season high and brought her season tally to eight.
“I know that Audrey is a great cutter and great shooter...she always knows I’m looking for her so she’s always ready. I was really happy we connected on a few plays,” Romeo said.
Weis’ seven saves in the game earned her the fifth best saves total in a career with 367 total saves, which was just enough to squeak out the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After splitting its first four games of the season at the Wake Forest Tournament, the Harvard baseball team was swept by top-ranked Florida (17-1) in a three-game series this weekend in Gainesville. The games marked the first time the Crimson (2-5) has played a No. 1 ranked team during coach Bill Decker’s tenure and were the first of nine the team will play this week in the Sunshine State.
“[Sean] Poppen [and I] have proven that we can compete with teams like that and we went in with that mentality,” junior pitcher Nick Gruener said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t win those games, but we definitely put up a good fight in both games on Saturday. I was pretty fired up about the weekend overall and I was pretty proud of us for doing what we did.”
FLORIDA, 3, HARVARD, 1
In what was the closest of the weekend’s three contests, the Gators rode the arm of sophomore right-hander Alex Faedo to victory. Faedo struck out 13 and only surrendered two hits in eight and a third innings of work. Gruener, a Florida native, held his own against a potent offense. The junior held Florida to three runs in seven strong innings. The Gators’ offense had tattooed Crimson pitching for 25 runs in the weekend’s first two games.
“If you make a mistake pitch, they’re going to capitalize on that,” Gruener said. “You have to throw a perfect game against a lineup like that.”
Both offenses were held scoreless through the game’s first six innings. The visitors did not record their first hit until junior Josh Ellis reached on a single in the top of the seventh. Nelson Maldonado’s double in the bottom half of the frame drove in Peter Alonso and Jeremy Vasquez to give Florida the only runs it would need. Maldonado scored later in the frame on a squeeze by sophomore centerfielder Nick Horvath.
Harvard manufactured a run in the ninth after freshman leftfielder Trent Bryan doubled with one out to remove Faedo from the game. Senior second baseman Mitch Klug reached first on a throwing error that allowed Bryan to claim the run but junior left-hander Kirby Snead slammed the door on the Harvard rally.
FLORIDA, 9, HARVARD, 2
In the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, the Crimson and its ace, senior Sean Poppen, squared off against the nation’s top collegiate pitcher, A.J. Puk, who many scouts believe will be the top pick in June’s MLB Draft. Poppen held his own early on before getting knocked around by the Gators’ offense as the game progressed while Puk struggled with command issues in a game in which neither starter made it out of the sixth inning.
Much like Gruener, Poppen did not surrender a run against Florida through the game’s first four innings. After a Dalton Guthrie sac fly plated Jonathan India in the fifth, the Gators’ offense came alive during the following frame. Two doubles and a single ended Poppen’s day and the hosts finished the inning holding a 5-1 lead after Crimson senior Nick Scahill allowed Maldonado to record a three-run home run. Florida added four more runs over the next two innings while Harvard got one back in the top of the eighth when freshman first baseman Patrick McColl singled home classmate Jake Allen.
“They’re the highest caliber pitchers that we’re going to face,” captain DJ Link said. “It’s a good challenge for us and it forces you as a hitter to simplify everything and not try to do too much. Overall, our hitters stepped up to the challenge and did pretty well.”
FLORIDA, 16, HARVARD, 5
The Gators jumped on Crimson sophomore Ian Miller for five runs in the weekend’s first two innings and then hung six more on senior T.J. Laurisch in the third. All told, Florida finished Friday’s game with 16 runs on 20 hits. Freshman second baseman Deacon Liput led the Gators with four runs batted in while Guthrie and sophomore designated hitter J.J. Schwarz got in on the action with three hits apiece.
Harvard’s offense scored more runs and had more hits on Friday than it did in its two games on Saturday combined. Sophomore third baseman John Fallon was a triple away from the cycle in three at-bats.
“He’s on fire right now and he’s a guy that’s going to be in the middle of our lineup and he’s been playing really solid defense as well,” Link said. “We need him to keep going throughout the year, he’s an integral part of our lineup and our defense. He’s doing a great job and really stepping up and being a leader.”
Classmate Conor Quinn had two hits and drove in a run while Link also had two hits. Sophomore Noah Zavolas and senior Joey Sliepka combined for three and two-thirds scoreless innings out of the bullpen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team began Saturday by posting its worst defensive half of the year statistically, allowing 10 goals in the first two quarters to an energized Penn State squad that was playing in front of a large crowd of fans in University Park, Penn. Just as at the end of every other game the Crimson has played this season, however, it had a chance to pull out a victory at the end.
On the strength of its third multi-goal fourth quarter comeback this season, Harvard overcame a 12-8 deficit entering the final period to force overtime. Sophomore attackman Morgan Cheek, who collected the winning tally in overtime in the team’s first game of the season, once again found himself in a position to score in sudden death.
Nittany Lions sophomore goalie Will Schreiner saved his shot cleanly, however, and initiated a breakaway that sent the ball back into his team’s attack area within a matter of seconds. Then, for the first time all season, an opposing squad scored on the Crimson in overtime.
With junior attackman Nick Aponte’s goal, Penn State (5-2) secured a 13-12 victory, its second over an Ivy League opponent this season after beating Cornell in February. Meanwhile, Harvard  (4-2) has now dropped two straight games after starting the season with four consecutive wins. The defeat to Penn State was the team’s first overtime loss in four such games this year.
The Nittany Lions immediately put their potent offense, ranked in the Top-10 nationally in goals per game, on display in the first and second quarters. After falling behind, 3-1, in the first 10 minutes, they ripped off a 7-0 run in which the entire team got involved. Five different goalscorers paced the surge, and during one three minute stretch at the end of the first period, they found the back of the net five times.
“We came out with a good amount of energy and I thought we played pretty well at the beginning of the game,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “They [Penn State] were just sharper and faster.”
Though Harvard struggled defensively in the first half, it’s offense kept the team in the match by responding to the Nittany Lions’ run with one of its own.
Crimson senior attackman Devin Dwyer, the squad’s leader in points, scored with 0:09 left in the second quarter to cut the deficit to 10-8. Dwyer and Cheek combined for five goals in the half to pace Harvard.
“Those guys are always really good for us,” said Crimson co-captain and midfielder Sean Mahon. “Especially Devin, not just getting goals and assists but also picking up key ground balls.”
After the two teams collectively scored 18 goals in the first half, both adjusted their game plans at intermission to slow the opposing offense. Penn State managed to pad their lead with two more goals in the third quarter, while Harvard was shut out completely. It was the second consecutive game in which the Crimson failed to score in the third stanza.
Trailing 12-8 entering the fourth, however, Harvard once again came to life. It turned the tables on the Nittany Lions, holding them scoreless while scoring four to tie the game at 12.
“We tied it up with several minutes left in the fourth and had several more chances to win the game outright,” Mahon said. “But we couldn’t get the job done then and ultimately couldn’t do it in overtime either.”
For Penn State, Aponte finished with six points on the afternoon, tallying three goals and three assists. Attackmen T.J. Sanders and Grant Ament also added five points apiece.
“Our guys did a great job of being resilient at the end of the game,” Wojcik said. “In the end, it came down to our playmakers against theirs, and they found a way to finish the job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team competed in three separate regattas throughout the weekend en-route to posting top-ten finishes in both of the team racing events, while improving on previous years’ results in its divisional race.
ST. MARY’S TEAM RACE
The Crimson sent many of its veterans to Maryland to face off against non-conference, local area schools, and Ancient Eight competitors in the St. Mary’s Team Race, while racing in 420s and FJs in a true team round robin format.
The team of seniors Andrew Mollerus, Sydney Karnovsky, and Marek Zaleski, junior Julia Lord, junior co-captain Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj, and sophomore co-captain Nick Sertl posted a seventh place result in a field of ten with a 4-5 performance. Although the group tied sixth place Boston College in record, they lost the head-to-head matchup against the Eagles, thus establishing the final outcome.
“Our results weren't amazing, but the weekend gave us a lot of time to really learn from our mistakes, which will help us a lot in future weeks,” Karnovsky said.
Tentative winds prevailed throughout the weekend as the light breezes of 4-7 knots from the Northeast on both days were barely enough to get in the required 45 races to complete the round robin event.
WOOD TROPHY TEAM RACE
Hosting a team race event for the first time this season, this Harvard contingent of FJ sailors finished fifth place out of eight competitors with a 7-10 record overall throughout the two day event.
The weather on the Charles was far from consistent in both force and direction. Faltering gusts of varying strength ranging from one to 24 knots were the norm.
“The wind conditions were interesting with some lighter air in the morning and some pretty big gusts in the afternoon, but overall the direction of the breeze was steady with few large shifts,” freshman Nicholas DiGiovanni said.  “[But] we were working well as a team and definitely learning a lot [from the conditions].”
On the crucial first day of the event, the coed group put forth a fifth place result against fellow NEISA competitors Boston College, URI, MIT, Brown, Penn, Boston University, and Fordham. The Crimson’s 6-8 effort on the day left it out of the Sunday double round-robin amongst Saturday’s top four finishers to determine the overall winner of the regatta.
“We did pretty well, certainly a tough competitor at the regatta,” DiGiovanni said.  “We lost a few races we should have won and won a few we probably should have lost, so there were some curveballs throughout the day. I’d say we landed bit below our mark by the end of the day, but it was a good day of racing.”
Even though it was left out of the top-tier event, the group was able to finish on top of the single-round robin racing amongst the rest of the event’s participants on Sunday. After racing was completed, Boston College was able to triumph over URI in a tiebreaker as Harvard placed between fellow Ivy League squads, Brown and Penn, in the standings.
NAVY REGATTA
Unfortunately for this group of women racing FJs and Z420s in the Navy Spring Women’s Regatta in Annapolis, Md., the weather did not cooperate enough to get in all of the required racing.  With the schedule shortened to only five races for each division of the women’s only interconference regatta, the Crimson strung together a 13th place finish in the 19 school field.
Having already forgone racing on Saturday due to the lack of wind, the analogous lack of racing on Sunday morning frustrated the sailors. But as soon as the wind began to pick up in the early afternoon, the women set out as quickly as possible to finish as many races as they could before the 3pm deadline.  Only five races for each division were able to get off as Harvard’s A-Division crew posted 66 points to the B-Division crew’s 48.
With fellow sophomores, skipper Taylor Ladd and crew Kirstin Anderson, racing in the A-Division and fellow freshmen, skipper Taylor Gavula and crew Divya Arya, in the B-Division, the Crimson was able to improve on its 18th place result from just one year prior by totaling 114 points over the ten races. Rival Yale was the winner on the day as it finished with a well-balanced, 42-point performance in the shortened event.
“Unfortunately there was not much wind in Maryland this weekend so the teams at St. Mary's and Navy didn't get to sail much,” Karnovsky said. “However I think that when both teams did get out, we shook a lot of rust off and fine tuned a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team has come to rely on its pressurized defense and steady goalkeeping to give it a leg up over most of its opponents this season.
The story, however, has not been so bright on the other side of the pool.
The Crimson’s recent trip to the Aztec Aquaplex at San Diego State University, where it posted a 1-2 record at the Aztec Invitational, demonstrated the lack of scoring consistency that Harvard (12-4) had been able to keep cloaked all season long. While it provided a few outbursts on the attack, the erratic offensive output came back to bite the team in the form of its first losing tournament record of the year.
“We lacked a little bit in the offensive area,” said co-captain Yoshi Andersen. “One thing that we really have to improve on is executing shots that we should make, and not letting those slip through our fingers…I thought we just didn’t play as consistently as we needed to.”
The Crimson opened the tournament by falling to No. 20 San Diego State, 9-5, before exploding for a ten-goal victory over Chapman, 16-6. The final game of the weekend, however, proved to be an illustration of Harvard’s inability to generate consistent goals, as it fell behind early and never regained footing against No. 11 UC San Diego, losing 10-7.
“We’re encountering teams with different strengths and capabilities…we’re playing teams that we don’t normally play, that we don’t know a lot about,” junior attacker Melissa Balding said. “Just playing different teams highlights where we need to make adjustments.”
UC SAN DIEGO 10, HARVARD 7
The Crimson entered the final quarter staring at an 8-4 deficit to the Tritons (18-6), and for a moment, Harvard looked like it came alive when it pulled the game back to 9-7 with just over three minutes remaining. Andersen, junior attacker Charlotte Hendrix, and freshman attacker Kristen Hong ignited the small rally with three goals in just over three minutes. However, UCSD senior goalie Courtney Miller, the 2015 WWPA Player of the Year, shut the game down thereafter, adding an insurance goal with ten seconds left sealed the Crimson’s fate.
“We really feed off each other’s enthusiasm and energy, and we found that energy in the 4th quarter, which is a bummer because we found it too late,” Balding said. “Had we been able to really use that energy and momentum throughout the game, I think we could have come out victorious.”
UCSD took a 3-2 lead out of the first quarter and never looked back, shutting Harvard out in the second frame and riding a 6-2 halftime lead to its 11th straight win and a sweep of the Aztec Invitational. Along the way, the Tritons downed three straight top-25 ranked teams in two days.
“Sometimes we overthink our spots a lot,” Andersen said. “It’s something we’ve been working on the whole season, [to] instead go on our instincts. By thinking too much, or reading the goalie, the defense can get on us.”
The team will look to get better at adjusting to the different teams that it’d be playing against during its nine-game California swing.
“I think that’s something we’re looking to take with us as we do have six more games in California, to take that energy and that spike that we had in the fourth quarter, to bring it to the [entirety] of the rest of our games,” Balding said.
HARVARD 16, CHAPMAN 6
The flip side of the coin is when the Crimson offense provides a flurry of scoring that quickly overwhelms its foes. Sunday’s morning game against the Panthers (3-11) provided just that illustration.
Harvard banged out an 11-0 run out of the opening sprint, spearheaded by opening goals from Andersen and junior attacker Michelle Martinelli, along with three goals each from Hong and sophomore attacker Sami Strutner. The Crimson took a commanding 13-1 lead into the halftime break and cruised from there.
SAN DIEGO STATE 9, HARVARD 5
The opening match against the host Aztecs (8-11) provided little in the way of offensive excitement after Andersen’s opening pair of tallies. After holding a 2-0 first-quarter lead, Harvard came to a halt, and SDSU scored five unanswered en route to handing the Crimson just its third loss of the year.
Although Harvard clawed its way back to 5-4 on two third-quarter goals, the Aztecs put the game away with four in the final frame.
The Crimson’s loss was its first defeat this season to a sub-.500 team.
