After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Disney bought 21st Century Fox in March of 2019, most of the talk was about the big names the company had acquired, like “The Simpsons” and “X-Men.” Finally, it was time for the “Titanic”/”The Little Mermaid” crossover we’d all been waiting for. But buried somewhere in that list of exciting intellectual property was a little movie called “Love, Simon.”
Starring Nick Robinson as the titular Simon Spier, “Love, Simon” was a fairly unremarkable movie. Sure, it was the first major studio teen rom-com featuring a gay protagonist. That’s great! Kudos to Fox (or, I guess, Disney?). But did it have to be about an upper-middle-class, cookie-cutter white boy with no discernable personality coming out to his uber-supportive friends and family? “I’m just like you,” Simon says at the start of the movie — but who, I wonder, was he talking to? Certainly not Victor.
“Dear Simon,” Victor says at the end of the first episode, “my story is nothing like yours.” And so begins the Hulu series’s 10-episode crusade to distinguish itself from the film. Victor Salazar (Michael Cimino) is the new kid at Creekwood High. He’s Hispanic, his parents are religious, and he’s a working-class student at an upper-middle-class school. “Back where I’m from, $500 is a lot of money,” he says, “but I guess at Creekwood, it’s just a drop in the bucket.” Showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger, it seems, are doing their best to fill in the representational gaps left by “Love, Simon.”
Unfortunately, their attempt is half-hearted at best.
This is not to say it fails entirely. Victor, for example, is “still figuring things out” — a refreshing, honest departure from Simon’s assuredness. “I’ve been doing research. Like, a lot of research,” he says with an eloquence only a high school sophomore could muster. “Some guys like guys, some guys like girls, some guys like both, and some guys like… feet?” Episode eight is arguably the season’s best with its willingness to lean into the ambiguity of exploration. Featuring Bram (Keiynan Lonsdale reprising his role from “Love, Simon”) guiding Victor through New York like some sort of gay Yoda, it’s truly a highlight.
The show’s most distinguishing element, however, lies in its depiction of family. Freed of the two-hour runtime limitation, writers could give Victor actual three-dimensional parents with problems and personalities and flaws (unlike Simon’s, whose family scenes could’ve doubled as pharmaceutical commercials). “For as long as I can remember, I’ve been my family’s fixer,” Simon narrates. This struggle, this tension between Victor’s desire to come out and his feeling of obligation to hold together his fractured family, is what drives the show, cements the show’s emotional stakes and adds a layer of nuance to the classic coming out story.
Beyond these two features, however, and despite the writers’ best attempts in the first episode, “Love, Victor” never manages to shake off the shortcomings of the original film. It feels too — in a word — safe.
Much like Simon, Victor is a confident, charming, straight-passing protagonist whose only defining personality trait is being good at basketball. He comes from a devout Catholic family, but the only episode that reckons with the relationship between queerness and religion — in the form of his standard-issue homophobic grandparents — ends with a simple and dismissive, “this is not the world we grew up in.” He’s supposed to be the new kid at school, but by day two, he’s walked on to the varsity basketball team and is riding the ferris wheel with “the hottest girl in [his] class.” He’s a working-class kid surrounded by upper-middle-class peers, but he never seems out of place, always perfectly comfortable paying for basketball fees and carnival food and spontaneous cross-country bus tickets.
This is 2020. There are queer kids — so many queer kids! And the ones who have to deal with religious families and poverty and social alienation need shows that genuinely grapple with these issues more than ever. It’s a shame, then, that every time “Love, Victor” verges on doing so, it chickens out. And just when it seems like the stakes become real, just as Victor finally musters up the courage to actually say the words “I’m gay,” the season ends. The hamartia of shows pre-approved for a second season, it seems, is the inability to make the first one satisfying on its own.
“Love, Victor,” like “Love, Simon,” has “teen rom-com” embedded in its DNA. The floating, effervescent, indie-pop-heavy score. The party- and banter-filled idealization of high school. The cringey biology teacher who shares far too much about her personal life (here, played to perfection by Ali Wong). The difference is that “Love, Simon,” for better or for worse, leaned into the genre — the kiss-on-the-ferris-wheel happy ending? Doesn’t get cheesier than that. And despite its shortcomings, the film still managed to deliver on that dose of teen rom-com warm fuzzies.
“Love, Victor” doesn’t capture that same magic. It never quite achieves its predecessors’ catharsis in its attempt to tell a more honest, less sanitized story — an admirable and important goal. Unfortunately, it just doesn’t try hard enough.
Season One of “Love, Victor” premieres on Wednesday, June 17 on Hulu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 2,000 faculty and staff members returned to scientific research laboratories at Harvard over the past week — the first large scale return to work since campus shut down in mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced on May 4 that Harvard would begin a “phased” reopening of Harvard’s research labs, which he described as “urgent.”
The return to research operations is overseen by a Lab Reopening Committee, initially formed by Vice Provost for Research Richard D. McCullough in collaboration with Dean of Science Christopher J. Stubbs at Garber's request.
The labs operate in shifts and use physical distancing and personal protective protocols. They are modeled after guidelines used by University labs dedicated to COVID-19 research, which have remained open as essential work.
Naina Kurup, a postdoctoral fellow in the Chemistry Department, wrote in an email that the guidelines have contributed to a “sense of security,” though there has been “a learning curve” for certain requirements, like avoiding common spaces and completing online check-ins.
Nevertheless, Kurup wrote that she and others in the lab are “slowly finding our groove again."
“It's been exciting to see my worms come back to life again so I can start the experiments I was planning at home!” she wrote.
Though researchers are social distancing, Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences Conor J. Walsh said his lab’s ability to return to in-person experiments is “positive,” noting its work is experimental in nature and cannot be done at home.
“For us, we're not able to do the types of research we are without being in the lab,” he said.
Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Professor Richard T. Lee ’79, a former Crimson editor, said the reopening of his lab is crucial because its work relies on experiments.
“We could write up some papers and write proposals, but we weren't getting new data,” he said. “We were very much shut down by the shutdown.”
Still short of full capacity, Lee said researchers must be “much more strategic” about time spent in the lab.
“We're trying to get those answers now as quickly as we can,” he said. “We're not at full capacity and so we have to be very careful about every person, hour in the lab.”
Though Lee is overseeing the lab, he said that he himself has not returned to the lab, since his presence would “take up one of the density spots” — the number of researchers authorized to work in the lab at a given time and.
Mohammed Mostafizur Rahman, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, said that he spent much of last week in preparation for future experiments.
“For all the work that we shut down, we need time to ramp up as well,” he said. “This first week hasn't been really much work as much as prep for the work — a lot of animal breeding, getting animals ready, getting your reagents ready.”
Leonardo A. Sepulveda Duran, a postdoctoral fellow in the Chemistry Department, said that he, too, is seeking to be “strategic” about his work in case the pandemic closes labs again.
“I'm focusing on just trying to get the most data I can in a few next months, so if we have to go into lockdown again, I can do the analysis of the data remotely, the same way I've been doing,” Sepulveda Duran said. “I imagine this is going to happen several times until we get a vaccine.”
For now, though, most said they are happy to be back to work.
“As an experimentalist, there's no other place you want to be than in your lab,” Rahman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he lied to federal investigators about research funding he received from China.
Lieber, who was indicted on two counts of making false statements last week, appeared via video-conference before Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler in Massachusetts District Court.
“This case is not about China or allegedly false statements,” Marc L. Mukasey, Lieber’s attorney, wrote in an email Tuesday. “Academic freedom is at stake here. Scientists and professors should stand with Charlie in this battle.”
Lieber will next appear in court July 30, according to the Boston Globe. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason A. Casey said during Tuesday’s arraignment that a trial in the case would last a week and involve roughly 10 witnesses, the Globe reported.
The two counts brought against Lieber, a world-renowned nanoscientist, center on his involvement with China’s Thousand Talents Program. The Chinese government established the Thousand Talents Program in 2008, hoping to attract scholars from across the world to contribute to Chinese development. The U.S. government has since said the program poses a danger to national security.
The first count alleges Lieber purposely told federal investigators in 2018 that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program and that he “wasn’t sure” how China categorized him. In fact, representatives of Wuhan University of Technology in China previously asked Lieber to participate in the program, and he signed a three-year contract as a One Thousand Talent “high level foreign expert” in 2012, according to charging documents.
The grand jury also indicted Lieber on a second charge of making false statements for causing Harvard to tell the National Institutes of Health in 2019 that he had never participated in the Thousand Talents Program.
Federal authorities arrested Lieber on Jan. 28; Harvard placed him on paid administrative leave later that day. Lieber was released after accepting a $1 million bail agreement.
The charge of making false statements allows for a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Tuesday that Harvard will close to observe Juneteenth. All faculty and staff will receive a full day of paid time off.
Juneteenth — celebrated annually on June 19 — commemorates the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves in the Confederacy. Though the proclamation was issued on Jan. 1, 1863, it took until June 19, 1865 for the news to reach Texas.
Bacow wrote in an email to faculty and staff that the holiday offers a “moment to acknowledge and celebrate the promise of a new beginning.”
“I cannot imagine a better year for Harvard to begin recognizing its significance,” he wrote.
This Friday will mark the 155th Juneteenth celebration in the United States.
The announcement comes after weeks of protests over anti-Black racism after the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade by police.
“These are extraordinary times distinguished by extraordinary displays of passion and resolve,” Bacow wrote. “We are everywhere reminded of the possibility of something different—something better—for our communities, our states, and our nation, as well as the deep reflection and hard work getting there will require of all of us.”
On June 5, the Harvard Coalition for Black Lives penned a letter to Bacow asking Harvard to take several actions to promote racial justice, including matching donations to support activism, providing pro bono legal defense for detained protesters, divestment from Harvard’s “current policing structures,” and disclosing the University’s relationship with local police.
In the days since, the University announced a new independent review of the Harvard University Police Department.
Bacow wrote that he is “proud” of efforts to “advance the cause of racial justice” at the University. Bacow previously faced criticism for a May 30 email espousing his “beliefs” about the nation without expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
“Each of us has a role to play in considering the past and the present as we work together to imagine our future, and I am proud to undertake that important—and essential—work with all of you,” Bacow wrote.

Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer spoke to nearly 1,000 attendees at a virtual Harvard Hillel event Monday evening where he discussed the Court’s recent move to virtual oral arguments and a landmark decision earlier that same day that protects BGLTQ workers from workplace discrimination.
Monday’s decision — in which Breyer voted as part of a 6-3 majority — ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Breyer said the arguments in the cases focused on whether the law’s ban of discrimination “on the basis of sex” applied to BGLTQ people.
“The Civil Rights Act says, Title VII, that you cannot discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, sex and a couple of other things,” Breyer said. “So the question was, did discrimination against a gay man or a gay woman or transgender person, did that discrimination — was that, on account of sex?”
Breyer also reflected on the Court’s transition to hearing arguments over the phone due to the coronavirus pandemic. When justices reconvened in early May, they began broadcasting the previously closed-door arguments to the public — an unprecedented move in the Court’s history.
Breyer said the phoned-in arguments had “less dialogue” than in-person arguments.
“There’s less of a chance of getting what I call the best kind of discussion, and that’s when you get the lawyer to forget he has a client,” Breyer said. “It’s more polite.”
Even as oral arguments go public, Breyer said that public pressure won’t sway the court.
“Public opinion is something that shouldn’t and normally doesn’t have much influence,” he said.
In the current Court — which includes four liberal justices and five conservatives — Breyer emphasized that despite disagreements in interpretation, the justices remain close.
“I have not heard a voice raised in anger,” he said. “You can be friends with people with whom you disagree a lot.”
Breyer said that disagreements are often “a question of emphasis” — different judges emphasizing different parts of the Constitution. But he stressed that though the Court is known for its close 5-4 votes, nearly 40 percent of Supreme Court decisions are unanimous.
“I usually end by saying, I can’t tell you what kind of life to live, but I can tell you that this document, the people who wrote that document knew that our experiment will succeed only if we understand it, its rule of law, and if we build and work together,” Breyer said, holding up a desk copy of the Constitution to the camera.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tensions flared in Harvard’s African and African American Studies Department this week after a professor proposed a forum to discuss potential partnerships with local police departments.
In an email to colleagues earlier this month, AAAS professor Doris Sommer invited faculty to a discussion of “activities that link Harvard to local communities beyond the University” in response to nationwide protests against police brutality. Since the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of the Minneapolis police on May 25, thousands of Americans have pushed for a greater public reckoning with anti-Black racism.
“Among the questions we might consider is how best to partner with community service inside the Cambridge/Boston Police Department, and perhaps how to participate in educational initiatives inside police academies and training centers,” Sommer wrote in her email.
Sommer also invoked “student voices” as part of the motivation for hosting the conversation.
At the forum on Monday, which took place on Zoom, a number of graduate students protested both the possibility of partnering with the police and Sommer’s reference to “student voices” on the issue.
Though the students remained anonymous — obscuring their video and using pseudonyms — they identified themselves as a “coalition” of graduate students in the AAAS Department and across the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In total, around 80 individuals attended the forum on Monday.
During the meeting, members of the group repeatedly pasted text from and links to a letter they had authored on the issue in the Zoom chat function.
“We are deeply disturbed to learn of a communication from faculty in our department, African and African American Studies (AAAS), proposing partnership with the Cambridge/Boston Police Departments,” the letter read. “We want to be ​very​ clear that this is not the sort of action student voices are calling for.”
The letter also advocated for AAAS and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to instead “commit resources” to four local organizations and sever all ties with the Harvard, Cambridge, and Boston police departments.
“That our department, which was ​born out of a moment of civil unrest​ very similar to the one we are experiencing today, or any of its members, would consider collaborating with law enforcement institutions is shocking and misguided,” the letter read. “This discussion stands in the face of all that we have been taught and all that our department claims to stand for.”
Sommer said in an interview Tuesday that her email “probably should have been phrased differently.” She said she included the reference to collaboration with police academies to “ground the invitation in an experience” that she knew had occurred in other cities.
“That opportunity doesn't seem to be on the table anymore,” Sommer said.
Nevertheless, Sommer said she did not think the protest was “necessary.”
“I understand the tone of the protest and the purpose of the protest, but from my position as a convener of an open meeting for faculty, I don't think that the student protest was necessary,” she said. “My intention was to convene a group of like-minded faculty members to explore what we can and should be doing as a community.”
AAAS Professor Walter Johnson said he supported the students’ efforts at the meeting and in an emailed statement Tuesday.
“Their entry into the meeting was dramatic, and while it seemed as if some of my colleagues were put off by that, I thought it produced a good discussion of very important issues,” he wrote.
Johnson wrote that the clash between students and faculty at the meeting was indicative of “two fundamentally different approaches” to issues of police brutality.
“How to reform police departments? Or how to dismantle them?” Johnson wrote of the two paths.
“For what it is worth, I do not think that the faculty of AAAS are all on the same side of this question,” Johnson added. “This is not simply a divide between faculty and students in the department or in the university at large.”
Sommer said she did not think there was a difference of opinion between herself, other faculty, and the students. She said she favors the abolition of police departments over reform but believes it must occur “in stages.”
“I don't think there was a difference of position,” Sommer said. “I think we were all involved in a moment of frustration among the students.”
Though the conversation continued for over an hour, faculty vowed to postpone a full discussion of the issues at hand until AAAS department chair Tommie Shelby could be present at the meeting.
Sommer said the number of faculty who attended the event was “promising” for future efforts. She said she hoped the faculty would also discuss possible educational initiatives and other community partnerships in later conversations.
“It was heartening to see people from a variety of disciplines come together so that we can think together,” she said. “I hope we'll be able to convene that in the future, and students will be rooting us on rather than worried about what we're doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to temporarily pause the hiring of vacant positions in the Cambridge Police Department and begin filling positions in the Housing Liaison Office, Community Development Department, and Central Square Library.
The order amended Policy Order 7, legislation sponsored by Councilors Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler and Quinton Y. Zondervan that calls on the city to redirect at least part of the FY 2021 CPD budget increase to improving the public health and safety of other departments.
Instead of filling CPD positions, the city will instead prioritize hiring positions like a case manager in the Housing Liaison Office, an Associate Housing Planner, and a new social worker in the Central Square Library. Sobrinho-Wheeler noted that if the amendment had not been passed, the hiring process for these positions would have begun as late as April 2021.
Ultimately, the funds reallocated to those hires equal a “$2.5 million Police Department budget increase,” according to the amended order.
As protests calling for police reform and racial justice ripple through the nation in response to George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police, city councilors said the policy order was an appropriate first step for Cambridge.
“This was a really short timeline to have this conversation about the FY21 budget, and it needs to continue being a part of a larger conversation about policing, accountability, and racism that the city as a whole has,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said at Monday’s meeting. “There are a lot of points we are never going to be able to address in this policy order alone, but that I hope we get to have a chance to talk about going forward.”
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said though CPD’s current practices have been shaped by “nearly a decade of intentional racial justice work,” the city must listen to residents who have voiced their concerns about public safety.
“I would argue as many have here in the past week that Cambridge Police Department is not Minneapolis. It's not New York, it's not LAPD or Buffalo or Albuquerque,” Mallon said. “But that doesn't mean we're perfect, nor does it mean that in this moment, we do not also have a call to action, and to push for achieving a deep look at policing and how we fund it in Cambridge.”
While Councilor Marc C. McGovern supported the policy order, he cautioned city officials that the reallocation of CPD's $2.5 million budget increase could undermine the department’s existing reforms. McGovern said it would be a mistake if the city cut funding for the police academy, the Office of Procedural Justice, or the new recruitment class — which he said was “the most diverse in the history of the department.”
“If the money impacted certain unfilled positions or demilitarizing the department — which we should do regardless of the budget — then that would be different,” McGovern said of the amendment. “The conversations here are not necessarily the conversations they need to have in Minneapolis or Los Angeles or even Boston. We have to be part of the national dialogue, while also realizing that the specifics are different in each municipality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 17, 2020, 9:11 p.m.
Harvard Law School’s announcement that it will continue online instruction for the 2020 fall semester drew scores of criticism from students who say remote learning will lower the quality of their legal education and disadvantage students facing difficult living situations.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in a June 3 email to students that the school would hold its fall term online, citing ongoing public health concerns and uncertainty about the availability of COVID-19 testing on campus. In response, a group of students drafted a petition for an alternative model and called for changes to the Law School’s proposed policies.
Following the announcement, the school held a series of webinars and posted online responses to frequently asked questions on topics such as tuition, grading, and leave of absence considerations. Several students, however, described the information provided by the school as either vague or insensitive.
“I think finally people are getting fed up with how HLS has been less than transparent in this whole process,” Law School student Paul A. Caintic said. “It's just all been handled really terribly, and it hasn't quelled students’ worries at all.”
Caintic said the webinars included “insulting” comments from administrators, such as advising debt-ridden students to rent an office space if they need a quiet place to study.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email that the webinar hosts were responding to a question about studying in disruptive home environments and suggested students could use grants or loans to rent an outside space.
“Ultimately, we indicated that every student must determine which options make the most sense for them, depending on their particular circumstances,” he wrote.
Rising second-year Law student Christopher Hall said Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark Weber suggested in a webinar that students should be grateful to experience an online education since the legal profession is increasingly relying on remote work.
“We just saw a seismic shift in what is going on in the legal environment in the last 10 to 12 weeks," Weber said. "The remote environment is going to be much more prevalent because we are already seeing that people can do it. The people who are here are going to be a little bit more seasoned in that environment because that is what it’s going to look like.”
“That's of course, you know, very difficult to hear and very dismissive of students’ concerns,” Hall said.
Weber wrote in an email that his response was aiming to address student concerns that learning remotely might place them at a disadvantage compared to peers at schools offering in-person instruction.
“Even before COVID-19, the legal profession was becoming increasingly open to remote work,” he wrote. “In my role leading the Office of Career Services, I always want to make sure I share with students how employers are thinking about these questions.”
Hall co-authored a petition to Manning and University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling on the Law School to consider implementing a hybrid semester plan, which would offer classes simultaneously in-person and online. Students would choose individually whether to attend classes in Cambridge or learn remotely, according to Hall.
“The basic outline is classes are offered in a multitude of ways so that they can meet each learner where they currently are,” he said. “It addresses the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all model of learning.”
The petition — signed by more than 400 students and alumni — highlighted concerns with remote learning, including decreased career advising opportunities, difficulty connecting with peers and professors, and the inability of international students to qualify for work visas for the summer of 2021 without two semesters of in-person classes.
It also featured a survey of nearly 400 students, which demonstrated that more than 80 percent of respondents would choose to defer if the Law School does not amend its policies for the fall.
In a statement responding to the petition, Manning defended the decision to hold a fully online semester. He argued a partial campus reopening under the hybrid plan would pose health risks to students and faculty and offer an unequal educational experience to students watching online broadcasts of classes tailored to the in-person instruction of their peers.
“We understand that fully on-campus courses have advantages over an online experience, but we think that hybrid courses may offer the worst of both worlds,” Manning wrote.
Students also criticized the Law School’s decision to not offer grading system accommodations or a tuition discount for the online fall semester.
“We all know that an online education is just not worth as much as an in person one,” Caintic said. “The connections you make, the facilities you get to use, the free lunches — those are all things that are going to be lacking from our education now, and yet a penny was not deducted from tuition.”
The Law School’s website notes that it already canceled its expected tuition increase, but that cutting tuition is a University-level decision.
Third-year Law student Michael E. Hornzell also voiced concerns about the school’s refusal to record fall semester classes. HLS offered recordings in the spring semester, but the school’s website states that students should participate in their fall classes “at the times they are offered.”
“For the school to not just build recording in is a bit ridiculous,” he said. “It just hurts the students whose internet might go out.”
The Law School has pledged to allocate $1 million to help students facing challenges with internet access or technology. Still, Hornzell said his access to a strong internet connection in the spring did not prevent frequent Zoom malfunctions that resulted in missing several minutes of class at a time.
Caintic said he had similar worries, claiming the inability to watch class recordings at students’ convenience would disadvantage those in significantly different time zones or who hold family responsibilities.
“I think it unduly prejudices low-income students, students who find themselves in a difficult home situation, people who have young children who can't afford a nanny, and our international population who again — I cannot stress enough — are being asked to become nocturnal to go to class,” Caintic said.
Hornzell said he agrees partial reopening plans such a hybrid semester might pose too many health risks due to the pandemic but argues the University should implement more measures to accommodate student concerns with online learning.
“I feel like they've really fallen flat in their response here,” he said. “I respect their commitment to the health and safety of the community members, but there's more to that in a total response.”

Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria announced the creation of an “enduring entity” to anchor anti-racist efforts at the school and committed to sharing a full anti-racist action plan by the start of the fall semester in an email to affiliates Monday.
“The entity will need to be funded and supported for impact and reach,” Nohria wrote. “It will need to include a roadmap for actionable work and desired outcomes for the coming year, three years, and five years and beyond.”
He added that three pillars will guide the endeavor: conducting research and education on racism, supporting Black affiliates within and outside the School, and working with the broader business community on issues of racial discrimination.
“We will also need a set of metrics and a system of accountability to ensure we are making progress,” Nohria wrote. “We will prepare and share the first such report on race at the School before the end of the summer.”
The email comes amid weeks of protests over police brutality and systemic racism across the country after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers.
The Business School held a community conversation about race on Thursday. Nohria wrote that the responses to the conversation “varied widely,” from appreciation to disappointment and questions of “Why are we having the same conversation again?"
In another email to affiliates on June 7, Nohria apologized for a lack of previous anti-racist work at the Business School, which has tenured just four Black professors in over a century.
“Today, on behalf of the HBS community, I apologize that we have not fought racism as effectively as we could have and have not served our Black community members better,” he wrote.
After that letter, Steven Rogers — an alumnus of the Business School and a senior lecturer from 2012 to 2019 — told the business-school focused publication Poets & Quants that the Business School perpetuates “systematic anti-black practices.”
“There is an institutionalized racism at Harvard Business School that keeps Blacks out of almost every aspect of the school,” Rogers told Poets & Quants. “It is virtually the same today as it was more than 30 years ago when I was a student.”
Rogers also said that Nohria is “the leader of anti-Black practices at the school and is complicit in them.” Rogers retired in 2019 after he was passed up for a promotion and over his frustrations over the lack of diversity at the Business School.
Nohria was set to step down June 30 after a decade at the helm of the Business School. After the coronavirus pandemic shuttered campus in March, he decided to stay in his post through December.
In his email on June 15, Nohria disputed some of Rogers's comments, though he said school leaders have since “reflected” on them.
“Though it's not appropriate for me to speak publicly on confidential personnel matters, please know that I and other leaders at the School have carefully reflected on Steve's words,” Nohria wrote in his June 15 email. “We believe there are inaccuracies in the piece and are working to share data related to race more transparently. But we cannot dispute Steve's lived experience at HBS—it pains us deeply and we must learn from it.”
Mark Cautela, a spokesperson for the Business School, declined to comment further on personnel matters related to Rogers.
Rogers first wrote to University President Lawrence S. Bacow about his concerns over racism at the Business School in 2018. In a copy of his letter published by Poets & Quants, Rogers wrote “There is something terribly wrong at HBS.”
In his reply, also published by Poets & Quants, Bacow wrote that “Nitin is well aware of the need to improve the environment at HBS, where diversity, inclusion, and belonging are concerned.”
In his June 7 email, Nohria vowed to take several “initial steps” towards anti-racism in addition to the long-term action plan.
Immediate changes include creating a page on the website with resources for “racial understanding,” training HBS affiliates on how to engage in discussions about race, developing an annual report to improve transparency on issues of racial equity at the School, using “creative approaches” to recruit and retain Black students, faculty, and staff, and creating a framework for business to use to report their diversity metrics.
“We will seek not just to reduce racism, but to proactively be anti-racist,” Nohria wrote.
At the close of his June 15 note, Nohria wrote that he had to “resist the urge to ask HBS's Black community for patience and trust.”
“People who have waited for centuries to receive what others get at birth should not be asked for patience, and trust must be earned,” he wrote. “I will ask, instead, for the commitment of the entire HBS community to this work.”
