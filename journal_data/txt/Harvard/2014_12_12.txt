After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The third time was almost the charm for Sir Ridley Scott as he revisits the historical epic again in “Exodus: Gods and Kings.” After mixed reviews for both “Kingdom of Heaven” and “Robin Hood,” this biblically inspired epic is his best attempt yet to recreate the visual and thematic spectacle that was 2000’s Oscar-winning “Gladiator,” combining stunning visuals with excellent performances.
Like its source material, “Exodus” is the story of the prophet Moses. The film, however, presents the biblical tale side by side with the relationship between Moses (Christian Bale) and Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses the Great (Joel Edgerton). Moses and Ramesses are raised as brothers, although the two men are destined for very different futures. Ramesses, the heir to the throne, while Moses will only ever be a close advisor. The revelation that Moses is actually not Egyptian but rather Hebrew leads to his exile. “Exodus” then shifts focus to Moses, depicting his slow evolution from loyal Egyptian general to biblical prophet.
Scott uses his whopping $140 million budget well. An epic earns its name through grandness in both visual and narrative fields. In the former, “’Exodus” checks all the boxes. Everything from routine aerial shots of Memphis to the climactic parting of the Red Sea are presented on a scale that is truly worthy of gods and kings. Another scene that comes to mind includes a massive battle in the film’s opening act between the Egyptians and the Hittites as the camera alternates between one-on-one clashes and a sweeping survey of the entire battle.
On a narrative level, “Exodus” tells a series of intriguing stories, but none of them are very original. There’s the sibling rivalry storyline, the atheist-to-believer storyline, and of course, the story from the Book of Exodus. For the first 20 or so minutes, the film egregiously rips off “Gladiator,” depicting a family crisis in which the pharaoh makes it clear that he prefers the “adopted son” to his own true heir before passing away.
Luckily, a cast of superb actors saves the film from becoming a hackneyed mess, salvaging and even sometimes even injecting life into oft-used storylines. Most press coverage of the “Exodus” cast has surrounded its lack of Egyptian, African, or Jewish actors, but hopefully this controversy will not detract from the outstanding work that this cast has done. Bale plays Moses with requisite intensity, hitting his Batman-register occasionally during angry tirades. The real gem of the film, however, is Edgerton, whose rage, frustration, and insecurity as Ramesses is chilling. Playing a character raised on the belief that he was a god before being radically cut down to size, Edgerton makes Ramesses appear almost relatable despite his complete lack of redeemable qualities.
Riding on the shoulders of Bale and Edgerton, the brother storyline is by far the film’s most interesting. The dynamic between Moses and Ramesses is so tortured and tragic that one almost wishes the film centered on the two men. At its climax, “Exodus” chooses between its two identities, the tale of two warring brothers and the religious origin story, picking the latter. Moses and Ramesses come close to a pivotal confrontation, but Scott pulls us away from a possibly earth-shaking clash. It is far and away the biggest disappointment of the film and the defining difference between it and timeless epics like “Gladiator.”
“Exodus” is a film that is undeniably dazzling although somewhat lacking in the narrative department. Amidst the recent flood of biblical epics, Scott’s film certainly leaves its distinct mark. To call it a return to form would be an overstatement, however. Better luck next time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As protests mount across the country in reaction to the recent killing of Eric Garner, there has been little to no legitimate response from any conservatives in this country, except to condemn the looters and flag burners. Those forms of protest were reprehensible—but focusing on them distracts from the dead black men, victims of state-sanctioned violence against the people, who lie dead in our streets.
As a lifelong conservative, I have always believed the unifying principle of our part of the political spectrum to be a belief in limited government. A limited government maintains low taxes to help businesses grow, reduces regulation to promote innovation, and keeps its powers in check to protect the civil liberties of the people. Based on the reactions to these killings, it seems that most of my conservative friends have ignored this third tenet.
Our Founding Fathers overthrew the British because they abused the colonists not only with taxes but also with physical brutality. We conservatives seem ready to applaud Thomas Jefferson’s push against a government that taxed people out of business. Where are we now when our government is shooting people in the streets? Nowhere. We are hiding. Why are we not shouting down and calling out the clear violations of the liberties that our ideology holds dear?
This desire for change is not, as many on the right have phrased it, a war on the police. Police officers do not go out everyday with the goal of killing black men. And yet we must recognize the racism present in our system that continually keeps blacks in this country down. When this happens even once, it is too often. The police officers who are sworn to protect us should be held to a higher standard; they should be the protectors of the people, not the persecutors.
Was Eric Garner a perfect man? No. But does that matter? No. Should he have been strangled to death as he gasped for oxygen in front of multiple officers? No. Is Daniel Pantaleo, the officer in question, guilty? I don’t know. That was for the court to decide, but he was never tried.
In response, conservatives will point to other factors that are harming the black community. Yes, Mr. Hannity, we know that the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that unemployment for black male youths is double what it is for whites of the same demographic. We know about black-on-black crime. We know that urban poverty and squalor are created by a lack of jobs, a bad welfare system, and that failing government schools hold black youth back in life. We know that broken families and fatherless homes are some of the leading indicators of future arrest and poverty. Those are bad things. We should fix them. But that’s not the issue we’re facing.
The issue we’re facing is forces of the state killing innocent youth. They weren’t tried. They were shot. They were strangled. They were killed.
We have tolerated a caustic system that permits those with power to put those without it down—especially when those without it are black. We can work to fix that system. We can work to address the prison industrial complex, the mandatory minimum sentences, the treatment of blacks as criminals and of urban areas as war zones. We can work to prevent the future killing of all types of people by authorities of the state. It’s time that we as conservatives stand and say that black lives matter. All lives matter.
Conservatives constantly bemoan our overreaching government. We talk about the government hindering our businesses, spying on our communications, failing our children in the classroom. What about when the government cuts short the life of one of our fellow citizens? That’s not “too much government?”
Don’t be a hypocrite. This is what the Founders warned us about. Wake up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CS50 instructor David J. Malan ’99 is the Willy Wonka of computer science. He has crafted CS50, his emporium, into arguably the most magnificent and sought-after course in the land. Last year, The Crimson praised CS50 for its “commitment to innovative teaching” and for “raising the bar for teaching at Harvard.” This statement’s Boolean value: false.
The first remark is true—Malan has innovation in spades. He has built his empire with futuristic tools, from 3-D printers to programmed bulbs, which leave us golden ticket-holders awestruck and anticipating. But these gizmos and their grandiosity shield the reality that the teaching in this class should not identify the new bar—chocolate or otherwise—against which other classes should be measured. TF Oompa Loompas do the majority of the job in section or at office hours, but they cannot make up for all that was lost during fancy videos and minutes of electronic dance music at lecture.
The Crimson is right that the College can learn a lot from CS50’s model. Harry R. Lewis ’68, former dean of the College and current director of undergraduate studies for computer science, is right to pinpoint office hours and a benefit for students of all types (or no types) of computer science backgrounds as areas CS50 should be proud of. Having almost 12 percent of the college enrolled in one course does indeed mean  that course is impressive. It does not mean that the course cannot be improved.
The first comment in the Q Guide’s “What would you like to tell future students about this class?” section summarizes CS50’s notable shortcomings by calling the course “poorly structured.”
“When you start to cover literally a language a day at the end of the course,” the student writes, “and when the psets are completely foreign even when you've attended every lecture, you can get overwhelmed fairly easily.”
Another commenter explains why CS50 problem sets take, according to a plurality of respondents on the Harvard Q Guide (and certainly in my experience), over 14 hours per week.
“Not because the PSETs are extremely difficult,” the student writes, “but because of their length and lack of clarity; office hours are extremely necessary in this course.”
“The secret of this class was office hours,” the student adds. He’s right. Why? One might guess that it’s the high TF-to-student ratio at office hours and the opportunity for one-on-one help. To some degree, that’s true. If you are almost finished with a p-set, having TFs available to take a peek at and help you debug your code is invaluable.
But—and I’m not proud to admit it—that’s not usually why I went to office hours, and I know it’s not why a lot of the people around me at those crowded Annenberg or Cabot tables went either. On more than one occasion—Problem Set 3: Breakout and Problem Set 8: Mashup come to mind—I went to office hours for the walkthrough code. And I left without much more than that.
Let me explain: At every office hours, which are three hours each and take place a whopping four times a week at a predetermined dining hall, one TF leads a walkthrough, where he or she is meant to take students through each step of the p-set to make it a bit more manageable. Ideally, a walkthrough would go through a p-set’s sections and remind students of the skills from lecture that they had already learned and could successfully apply to the p-set. Then, office hours would end, and everyone would get to bed by 10:30 p.m. Wouldn’t that be nice? You bet your CS50 cupcake it would!
But there aren’t enough CS50 stress balls in the world to bridge the gap between that fantasy and how things actually work. Because for referring to previously taught skills to provide enough clarity for students, the skills have to have been, well, previously taught.
Except the teaching part never really happens in CS50 lecture. So referencing the skills becomes useless, and TFs are left to provide students with actual code in the hopes that students understand what they’re being given. A lot of the time, they don’t. And they don’t need to, because major assessments have virtually nothing to do with the p-sets in the class.
If you left me in a room for a week with no other agenda than to redo p-set 8, I would likely still not be able to complete that task. After all, I never learned how to do it in the first place. This is not to say I didn't learn anything from CS50—I learned a lot, and I don't regret taking it. But for the amount of resources the class has and the number of hours it requires from its students, I should have learned more, and I should be more comfortable with the material that was “covered.”
Many TFs justify the cursory attention given to web programming in the last few weeks of CS50 by saying that, in the real world of computer science, we would be similarly be left to Google to learn certain skills. However, if we’re taking a course at debatably the top university in the world—a course that will soon be offered to another set of students at another top university—shouldn’t our teachers be able to break down for us what we could have learned from Google for free? Should Google really have so much to do with a Harvard education?
My answer is no. CS50’s showmanship is top notch, but before Yale becomes our Charlie Bucket and inherits this famous empire, let’s be sweeter to the next crop of students and bring CS50’s bar for substance up to its bar for sparkle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric Garner’s death at the hands of New York City Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo was unnecessary and tragic. That Pantaleo managed to avoid indictment by a Staten Island grand jury is further indication that the American criminal justice system still deals inadequately with police violence in communities of color. Since the day the grand jury made its troubling decision, demonstrations have taken place at Harvard, across the country, and even around the world.
These protests have shown the world that enough is truly enough. The rights of minorities, particularly people of color, have been trampled on for too long.
While the demonstrators rightly continue to keep the issue in the spotlight, raising awareness cannot be the only goal. Certainly, the ignorant backlash against protesters from several commentators indicates that many Americans are still not aware of the racial disparities that exist in countless facets of American life. At the same time, however, the severity of the Garner incident shows the need for meaningful policy changes, and soon.
Although the existence of a video documenting the entire incident did not secure an indictment in the Garner case, we stand by our previous statement in favor of requiring police to wear cameras on their person. Body-worn cameras have demonstrated their use as a prophylactic measure that decreases instances of police brutality and of civilian complaints.
Cameras are certainly not the entire solution to this problem, and they must be accompanied by strict regulations regarding when officers are allowed to turn them off. However, combined with a battery of other measures, President Obama’s initiative to equip police with body-worn cameras is a step, if a small one, in the right direction.
To effect lasting change, the energy of the current demonstrations must also make it to the ballot box. Young voters and voters of color have had unfortunately low turnouts in the past several elections, most notably in the recent midterm election. According to a Pew study done days before the election, over a third of non-voters are under the age of 30 and about 43 percent are people of color. Too much of the current political discourse centers around restrictive measures, like voter identification laws, that will make it harder for minorities to make their voices heard. For lasting change in police-community relations, however, the young people and people of color must vote.
While significant, policy changes can only address symptoms of the United States’ wider issues with race. Beyond issues of police procedure, the Eric Garner case and countless others like it are about racism in America, and must be recognized as such.
Racism is certainly not limited to police forces, but racism perpetuated by the government is particularly heinous. As Max Weber famously put it, the government “claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.” In a democracy, the government must use that monopoly sparingly and equitably if it is to maintain its political legitimacy. When police abuse their power by taking a heavy-handed approach to protesters speaking out against institutional racism, they further harm their own credibility and lend credence to the view that they represent an antagonistic force in many communities.
We should be able to expect better from our police forces. We should be able to expect better from our government. We should expect better from all Americans, who continue to ignore the deadly role racism plays in American society. Garner’s death must not be forgotten. Enough is enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In our stern voices, we chanted: “Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter!”
Confused, boisterous, and starkly naked, they replied: “U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!”
During this year’s Primal Scream, we were a part of a group of students who stood in front of Hollis Hall as part of a peaceful protest in response to the recent non-indictment of Darren Wilson and Daniel Pantaleo, police officers who are responsible for the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, respectively.
With the support of the administration, we hoped to delay primal scream with a 4.5-minute moment of silence, symbolic of the 4.5 hours that Brown’s body lay on the street after his death. Black lives matter, and we wanted to engage the larger Harvard community on some of the most salient issues of our time: systemic racism, oppression, and brutality on black and brown bodies. And yet, to our dismay, the efforts of several administrators who rallied for students to respect the moment of silence were muted by the chanting of the naked mass. Moments later, primal screamers ignored our request for the moment of silence and, with us blocking their typical counter-clockwise path, ran the opposite way, only to finish where they had started: face-to-face with chants of “Black Lives Matter!”
We are not sure under what pretense the U.S.A. chants came in reply to our calls for justice, as we know the traditional occurrence of U.S.A. chants at primal scream. We are not sure of the full intention behind the sneers, the annoyed side comments, and the profanities that were thrown at the faces of peaceful protestors. We know the festivities that occur in conjunction with primal scream. We know that there was a considerable amount of confusion surrounding the event and its purpose. And we know, indeed, that many people during primal scream are not completely sober.
But we are sure of our disappointment. We are sure of our discomfort, as demonstrators encountered profanity, physical assaults, and gestures of obscenity. We are sure of our unease, as we witnessed many primal screamers disrespect us and the administration who supported our peaceful protest. We are sure of our collective anger by the extreme lack of sensitivity for 4.5 minutes—just 4.5 minutes—of silence for Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Aiyana Stanley Jones, Tamir Rice, and the countless others who have suffered and died at the hands of reckless and racist law enforcement.
This peaceful protest is not inhibiting the fun of our classmates. As peaceful protesters, we asked for their respect as our peers, many of whom we consider friends. Primal scream brings together hundreds of students on Harvard’s campus. There have been peaceful protests on campus already, and yet none of them reached this vast number of people. As the protest organizers have outlined, the protest “provides a venue to reach people not part of that self-selecting group of students who would attend a protest in the first place; the protest is an invitation and an opportunity for these students to stand with their classmates in solidarity and critique the entrenched privileges that they may find themselves heirs of.”
The response we attained was far from ideal. But our hope and fervor in proclaiming our message remains unwavering. The disrespect we experienced this night stands as a testament to why we need to continue our work as advocates for black lives and activists against an oppressive criminal justice system. During this night, running naked throughout Harvard Yard was prioritized over standing in silence in solidarity with classmates, classmates who are personally affected by the recent grand jury decisions in Ferguson, Staten Island, and Cleveland. These misplaced priorities are indicative of why our protests for the recognition of black lives will continue to matter.
We have peacefully protested in the streets of Cambridge, Boston, New York, and elsewhere: “Hands up! Don’t shoot! Hands up! Don’t shoot!”
We have peacefully protested in front of the John Harvard Statue: “No justice! No peace! No racist police!”
We have peacefully protested on all floors of Lamont Library: “If we don’t get it, shut it down!”
We have peacefully protested in front of the naked mass of Primal Scream: “Eric Garner! Michael Brown! Shut this racist system down!”
And we will continue to protest in support of the notion that black lives matter. Our voices ring with knowledge that we do not live in a post-racial society. The time to stop death and violence on black and brown bodies is now.
Black. Lives. Matter.
We hope that one day you will join us in chanting and believing the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of about 30 students attempted to hold a silent demonstration in the first minutes of Primal Scream, a biannual naked run around Harvard Yard, early Thursday morning, inadvertently leading to a chaotic exchange of words and gestures that reversed the usual direction of the run and left many questioning the significance of the heated interaction.
The run is a College tradition in which students, at times inebriated, run naked around the Yard on the eve of the first day of exams. It usually attracts more than a hundred participants.
Protesters said that their goal was not to protest Primal Scream itself, but to hold a four-and-a-half minute period of silence before the run for Michael Brown of Ferguson, Mo. and Eric Garner of New York—two unarmed black men who were killed by white police officers this summer—and to join in solidarity for people around the nation who have experienced racism. The organizers of the demonstration had posted a Facebook event describing their plans for the protest ahead of the event.
While protesters said they felt ignored and angered by the actions of Primal Scream participants, several students in the run said they could not see nor hear the protesters because of the noise and nature of the gathering, with some saying they would have participated in the protest if they had known about it in advance.
About ten minutes before the intended start of the run at midnight, the group of protesters convened near Harvard Hall on the path encircling the Yard and held signs, one of them reading “Black Lives Matter.”
About 25 College administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, were present in the surrounding area before the run began, and a few stood near the protesters to ensure that both the moment of silence and the run could take place safely, according to Dingman. Dingman said he had met with the Harvard Band in advance and asked that they not play during the moment of silence.
As student streakers began to gather, talking and shouting, just a few yards away, the protesters, some of them clad in black sweatshirts with the words, “I ♥ Black People,” stayed silent. After failing to quiet the students with a megaphone, Khurana was lifted onto the back of a half-naked man, from where Khurana tried to quiet the crowd again.
When the streakers continued to talk, the protesters broke their silence, chanting, “Silence. Silence.” Meanwhile, shouts of “U.S.A., U.S.A.!” erupted from the group of runners, drowning out the calls for silence by the protesters. Primal Scream participants have also chanted “U.S.A., U.S.A.!” during past runs.
“This is absolutely ridiculous, this is absolutely ridiculous,”one of the protest organizers, Aubrey J. Walker ’15, said to his fellow protestors. “We’ll wait here all night. Guys, look to your left, look to your right, these are your brothers and sisters and siblings. All we ask is for four and a half minutes of silence.”
Shortly after, a group of streakers from the back of the crowd began to run in the opposite direction of the protesters, and the rest of the streakers followed in a lap around the Yard. The protesters turned to face the streakers after they finished their first lap around the Yard, forcing some streakers to run off the path and into the middle of the Yard. Some runners chanted, “black lives matter!” while others shouted obscenities.
After the runners dispersed, the protesters walked to Lamont Library, shouting slogans common to the widespread protests of recent weeks, such as “No justice, no peace.” After walking up several floors in the library while chanting, the protesters reassembled in the Lamont lobby, as Khurana looked on.
Addressing the crowd, Walker and Sarah F. Cole ’16, another protester and president of the Black Students Association, expressed frustration that the silent demonstration did not go as planned.
“I know that people are tired,” Cole said. “But it’s important that we keep rallying, keep pushing.”
“Tonight we said black lives matter, and they really do,” Walker said.
Members of the protest said that they were upset by the reactions of the student streakers.
Amanda D. Bradley ’15, who helped organize the protest, said that while she did not know the intentions of the primal screamers, she felt disgusted by what they were chanting.
“For people to say black lives matter, and for the crowd to shout back ‘U.S.A.,’ which is upholding a system that is oppressing black people, I think that that is problematic,” she said.
Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15 said she was appalled by what she called a disrespect both for Khurana and the protestors.
“I think that for many students of color, particularly black students, there’s always a fear of what white retaliation looks like,” she said, citing obscene gestures and language toward protesters.
Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, another protester, said she was “disturbed” and “angered” by reactions to the protest, especially from those in the front of the crowd of streakers who she believed could hear the calls for silence.
Meanwhile, some students participating in the run said they were confused by the demonstration and unaware that it was taking place.
Emily Savage ’15, a runner, said she did not know that a protest was occurring.
“It killed me that I had no knowledge of the four-and-a-half minute silence,” she said. “And I think I speak for so many students when I say that it's so unfortunate [that we didn't know it was happening].”
Skip L. Rosamilia ’17, a Primal Scream participant, said that he could not hear or see through the crowd of streakers.
“I’m sad because it...look[ed] like there was one group who was for [the demonstration] and a huge group that wasn’t, and I don’t think that was the case,” he said, calling the interaction between the protest and the streakers a “huge egregious misunderstanding.”
Khurana also said many runners told him that they would have joined the protesting students if they had known about the demonstration.
“I think what it was, is just...a tight physical space and a relatively loosely structured event without actually clear planning,” Khurana said, noting that it was difficult for him mediate between the two groups of people.
Some students voiced similar concerns before the demonstration on the Facebook post for the event, saying that the protest would be disruptive to the College tradition of Primal Scream and potentially would risk student safety. As a result, organizers posted an update on the protest’s Facebook page saying that they had changed the nature of the protest from a die-in to a moment of silence out of safety concerns and in an effort to preserve the Primal Scream tradition.
Though Walker, one of four principal organizers of the protest, acknowledged Thursday afternoon that there “was some confusion as to what was going on and not a lot of individuals knew what was happening,” he said he thought the protest was a success.
“The event was successful because it started a conversation in communities that haven't been talking about this.”
The Primal Scream protest is the latest in a string of protests in reaction to the non-indictments of the white police officers in the Brown and Garner cases. Students from the College and graduate schools, as well as the Boston community, plan to march in the Yard on Friday in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Close to 1,400 individuals had RSVPed to the march’s Facebook page as of four p.m. Thursday.

The benefits of the Mediterranean diet could be closely tied to telomeres, one of many biomarkers of aging, according to a recent study by researchers at the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital.
By analyzing 4,676 disease-free women from the Nurses’ Health Study, researchers found that adherence to the Mediterranean diet—which has long been associated with longer life expectancy and a lower risk of heart disease—is linked to longer telomeres.
“We look at telomeres, which are the ends of chromosomes,” said Immaculata De Vivo, senior author of the study and an associate professor at the Medical School and the School of Public Health. “If you look at a shoelace, there’s a plastic part at the end that protects the shoestring. That’s what a telomere does. It keeps the chromosome from falling apart.”
This protective structure of chromosomes gets shorter each time a cell divides, and shorter telomeres are correlated with lower life expectancy and a higher risk of diseases related to aging.
Clifford W. Lo, an associate professor in the School of Public’s Health Department of Nutrition who was not a part of the study, said that the new study provides strong scientific evidence for the benefits of the Mediterranean diet.
“For many years, nutrition has concentrated on nutrients rather than food and diets, and most of the dietary suggestions by the U.S. government are not specifically tested in regard to mechanism,” Lo said.
The Mediterranean diet has drawn increased scientific support within the last decade, which could help persuade the public to adopt it, according to Lo.
Moreover, health benefits are not the only incentive for people to practice the Mediterranean diet. The dietary pattern, which consists of wine, olive oil, whole grain, fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables, is “not only good for you, but also delicious,” De Vivo said.
While the researchers have found a correlation, scientists are still uncertain if the Mediterranean diet specifically results in longer telomeres. “Our study shows that the dietary pattern is effective only when all components are put together, so it should be the combined result of different substances,” said Marta Crous Bou, first author of the study and a postdoctoral research fellow.
According to De Vivo and Crous Bou, the next steps are to look for evidence of causation between these variables and also to test the effect of the Mediterranean diet on men.

Harvard College notified 16.5 percent of the 5,919 students who applied to the Class of 2019 under the early action program of their acceptances Thursday, marking the lowest admissions rate in the last six early action cycles.
This year’s number of applicants signifies a roughly 26 percent increase from the 4,692 applicants who applied early last year. Early admissions rates for the classes of 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 21.1, 18.2, and 18.3 percent, respectively. Regular admissions was the only option for applicants to the classes of 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.
Among those early applicants who were not offered admission Thursday, the majority, 4,292, were deferred to the regular decision process, 541 were denied admission, 19 withdrew, and 90 submitted incomplete applications.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview Thursday that increased online presence of the Admissions Office—including a new website, videos, and social media through the outreach initiative Harvard College Connection—could have contributed to the increase in the number of applicants.
This year’s early admissions pool shows slight increases in the percentages of minority students. Of those admitted early to the Class of 2019, 22.7 percent are Asian American, 10.3 percent are African American, 11.4 percent are Latino, 1.2 percent are Native American, and .3 percent are Native Hawaiians, compared to 21, 9.9, 10.5, .9, and .2 percent figures, respectively, last year.
Of the admitted students, 49.7 percent were women, compared to an overall admitted pool that was about 45 percent female last year.
“We trust that recruiting efforts for women through [Harvard College Connection] and other outreach had a significant effect,” Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath '70 said in a press release.
Fitzsimmons said that academic interests among admitted students were generally similar to those of students admitted last year. The number of students indicating a potential humanities concentration was 15 percent of the total admit pool, compared to 14 percent last year. Twenty-eight percent of students expressed interest in the social sciences, compared to last year’s figure of just 23.5 percent. The number of students declaring undecided declined from 12.2 percent last year to 8.5 percent this year. Computer science also saw an increased number of potential concentrators from 3.7 percent last year to 5.1 percent this year.
“We attribute [the increased interest in computer science] to the incredible popularity of [Computer Science 50: "Introduction to Computer Science I"]. That has really been in the news a great deal,” Fitzsimmons said, adding that Steven A. Ballmer’s recent gift could also play into the larger number of students interested in computer science.
Fitzsimmons declined to provide the number of legacy students who applied or were admitted early, saying that it might give the wrong impressions about the overall class, focusing too much on early admissions rather than on who ultimately attends the College. He said, however, he would share the number of legacy students in the Class of 2019 with The Crimson after regular admissions decisions are sent and students accept their offers.
The Crimson was granted early access to admissions figures and an interview with Fitzsimmons under the condition that it not publish the story until Friday morning. Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, sat in on the interview.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Business School professor Krishna G. Palepu said that he will appeal an Indian court’s ruling that found him guilty of failing to obtain government approval for fees he charged for consulting services provided to Satyam Computer Services.
The ruling, announced Monday, ordered that Palepu pay a fine of 2.66 crore rupees, or about $430,000, according to the American Bazaar, an amount Palepu said represented excessive compensation he received from the company.
Palepu was tapped in early 2012 as University President Drew G. Faust's senior advisor for gloabal strategy. He has also served as a senior associate dean at the Business School.
The ruling against Palepu was one of a number of other verdicts announced Monday as part of one installation of legal proceedings surrounding Satyam Computer Services, a top Indian outsourcing company that in 2009 was accused of engaging in falsification of its accounts. In the investigations that followed, India’s Serious Fraud Investigation Office filed complaints stating that Palepu failed to obtain government approval for the work he did at Satyam.
Palepu said that the money in dispute represents a discrepancy in the way the compensation he received from the company was filed, not a fine for misdoing. After exceeding a certain cap on compensation, independent directors of Indian companies must receive government approval, he said.
“The dispute is not about the money being legitimately earned—the dispute is about whether the company has done the paperwork properly or not,” Palepu said.
Though the ruling signals guilt on Palepu’s part, he maintains that he complied with regulations, making the information about the work he did public to shareholders.
He said the current ruling improperly targets him, citing a U.S. federal judge’s decision to dismiss shareholders' lawsuits against the directors of the company. Palepu wrote in an email Thursday that he was an independent director at Satyam from 2003 to 2005, and subsequently a non-executive director until he stepped down in 2008.
In the appeals process, Palepu aims to address what he calls an unfair verdict.
“My lawyer advised me very strongly that we will prevail on appeal,” he said.
The investigations that led to this week’s ruling are part of a broader corporate fraud case, one of the largest in India’s history. In 2009, B. Ramalinga Raju, Satyam’s chairman, admitted to falsifying the accounts of the company, inflating its earnings and assets, according to The New York Times. In his disclosure, Raju admitted that the company did not have 50.4 billion rupees, or $1.04 billion, of the 53.6 billion rupees it listed as assets in the second quarter of Indian fiscal year 2008.
Palepu said that he played an integral role in exposing the scandal. After he received a whistleblowing email, he brought the fraudulence to the attention of the company’s board, he said.
“I did more than my job to bring the problem to light,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five appearances in front of the Cambridge Historical Commission, local developer Raj Dhanda said that his proposal for a three-story addition to the Galeria building in Winthrop Square was approved last Thursday.
Though Dhanda’s original plan, first presented to the Commission in March, featured three levels of microunit apartments, he ultimately decided to abandon initial plans for residential use in favor of commercial development after his proposal was unanimously voted down twice earlier this year. The three-story addition to the Galeria will now likely serve as office space, according to Dhanda.
Community members and the Historical Commission previously expressed concerns that a large residential complex would cast a shadow over the historic Winthrop Park, located across the street from the Galeria.
“Apart from design itself there were many people who felt that a residential design was not appropriate here,” Dhanda said. “This made me change from residential to commercial, and we reduced the size of the building to satisfy people in the way they wanted.”
According to Dhanda, key features of the new design include a “step” facade, where each level of the building recedes further back from the previous story, as well as improvements to effectively integrate the additions with the existing structure.
“Make no mistake, this will be an expensive building…but the whole thing would look like one brand new building,” Dhanda said.
After modifying his plans to commercial purposes, Dhanda and his architect Peter Quinn sat down with several members of the Historical Commission to discuss ideas for a new proposal, Dhanda said. Four meetings and about ten hours later, Dhanda and his team had solidified an updated plan to present to the entire Commission.
“From the first meeting I got the sense that [the Commission was] not anti-development, they just wanted to have some input into the design,” Dhanda said. “We went back and forth with reports that Commission gave us. We changed design, colors, many things. We decided to really do a serious upgrading of existing building, the glazing, all that stuff.”
The commission's executive director, Charles Sullivan, said that what ultimately allowed the revised plan to pass was its smaller upper floors and remodeled, uniform appearance.
Addressing general concern that the building’s design is too contemporary, Sullivan noted that “the Square is very eclectic.... There’s no prescribed style.”
According to former Harvard Square Defense Fund President G. Pebble Gifford, who participated in the negotiations with Dhanda, the newly approved plans are an improvement upon past versions. She praised the removal of “garish” colors and the implementation of one universal color and window scheme, as well as the removal of “odd, bulky, box-like shapes” that were previously to be located on top of the proposed development.
Yet Gifford said she is still not completely satisfied with the project.
“On the whole I’d say it’s better than it was but not exactly what we would’ve liked,” Gifford said. “The building is very cubist in its forms.... We made a silk purse out of a sow’s ear, so to speak.”
Gifford added that the development received approval after a “pretty intense” review by Cambridge citizens.
“[The] conditions were to tone down the fluorescent lights in the office, to have Staples get rid of its red [colors on its storefront]...and [Dhanda] has to make sure that the greenery he’s putting in those balcony stays,” she said.
Dhanda said that he will appear in front of the Cambridge Planning Board on Jan. 27 to appeal for a special permit for parking.

Harvard has raised $2 billion since the public launch of the University-wide capital campaign in Sept. 2013, bringing the total value of gifts and pledges to $4.8 billion, University spokesperson Jeff Neal said on Thursday.
This latest figure—which is up-to-date as of the end of September—brings the University $500 million closer toward its $6.5 billion goal since the last official figure, which was current through the end of the fiscal year in June.
The vast majority of donations raised between the end of June and September came from a $350 million gift from Gerald L. Chan in unrestricted endowment funds for the School of Public Health. The school was renamed the T. H. Chan School of Public Health with the gift, the largest single donation in University history.
If the University reaches its $6.5-billion goal, it would make the Harvard Campaign the largest fundraising drive ever in higher education. During the quiet phase of the campaign, more than 90,000 supporters contributed $2.8 billion in donations and pledges.
At the Campaign’s launch last fall, officials announced that 45 percent of the funds raised will go to teaching and research, 25 percent to financial aid and “the student experience,” 20 percent for capital improvements, and 10 percent as “flexible funding to foster collaborations and initiatives.”
This most recent figure does not include a gift from Steve A. Ballmer ’77 to add 12 professorships to the Computer Science department. This donation is estimated by The Crimson to be about $60 million, though Ballmer declined to specify its exact size.
Harvard reported a $2.7 million operating surplus in Fiscal Year 2014, a figure that was boosted by $420 million in current use gifts.

A group of researchers led by Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology associate professor Chad Cowan have discovered compounds that could serve as a tool in the fight against obesity.
The significance of the discovery, according to Cowan, lies in its potential to transform the body’s energy-storing white fat into energy-burning brown fat.
“[White fat] provides energy back to the body when you are in caloric debt,” Cowan said, noting that white fat cells store energy in the form of fat deposits for extended periods. Brown fat cells, on the other hand, expend energy to regulate body temperature and are positively correlated with a lower body weight.
Recently, the researchers discovered two compounds that foster the transformation of white fat cells into brown cells, potentially enabling the body to burn more calories from its fat reserves.
“The [transformed] cell burns off energy and creates heat,” Cowan said. Most importantly, he noted, the converted cells continue to behave like brown cells even after the converting compound is removed from the cell.
Cowan’s findings represent a “fantastic discovery,” according to Patricia K. Donahoe, a research director at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies stem cells. “Understanding this pathway could have tremendous results in the medical industry,” she said.
Though the compounds Cowan discovered have shown signs of success in mice, he and his team hope to develop their results into drugs for humans. The first step, Cowan said, is to find similar compounds that have already been approved for human use.
“If we found drugs that were already in use in man, the development of the pill would be very quick,” he said. “However, it could take as many as ten years.”
One of the most immediate benefits of the prospective pill would be the development of a new way to fight obesity, though Cowan stressed that this pill would not be a panacea. For one, he said, white fat is essential, and lacking fat is just as detrimental as having too much.
In addition, he noted, his discovery does not prepare the way for a world without exercise.
“My one reservation is that I would never want people to think that this medication would replace physical activity,” he said. “It wouldn’t replace all the other benefits of exercise such as increased bone mass, muscle mass, and flexibility.”

A 10-2 loss is always a tough pill to swallow, especially for the Harvard women’s hockey team.
Yes, the Crimson (6-2-2, 5-1-1 ECAC) was playing against No. 1 Boston College, but most would have expected Harvard—a preseason favorite to win the national title—to put up more of a fight against the best team in the country. Loaded with talent across the ice, the team entered its 2014-2015 campaign with a No. 3/4 national ranking. But just over a month into its season, the Crimson was forced to swallow its worst loss in almost two decades.
“We’ve taken our lumps a little bit,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said upon the team’s return to home ice on Dec. 2.
A tough road schedule in November saw Harvard steadily slide down the national rankings. The Crimson went 1-2-2 in a four week-long break from home ice, dropping a 5-4 decision to unranked St. Lawrence while squeezing out ties against two top-10 programs in Clarkson and Boston University. It was a difficult schedule to start out the year, and by the end of the month, the Crimson had compiled its worst record to start the season in roughly five years.
A few lumps, perhaps. And yet, though it may not have the record to show it, the Crimson is not far off from reaching its full potential.
There have been quite a few glimpses of it already this season. And perhaps more importantly, the team has shown grit when the going’s gotten tough.
Harvard bounced back the evening following its BC blowout to take down Northeastern, 4-3, after trailing the Huskies by two goals in the first frame. Then, in its much-welcomed return to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center a few nights later on Dec. 2, the Crimson topped Dartmouth, 4-1, for its first Ivy win of the season.
“We’re building our confidence,” Stone said after the squad’s win over the Big Green. “Things are getting better.”
Harvard showed signs of its peak form this past weekend, upending then-undefeated No. 4/4 Quinnipiac with a clutch third-period score to secure the 2-1 victory. With the win, Harvard vaulted back up the national rankings, climbing as high as fifth in the PairWise Rankings.
The growing pains seen earlier this season can easily be attributed to the adjustment that comes with the bevy of talent that Harvard boasts on its current roster. “Weapons all over the place” is how Stone describes it.
There’s the Olympians returning to the roster, adding on to a squad that had already grown and matured under associate head coach Maura Crowell in Stone’s absence. The incoming freshman class—one of the most talented and decorated in recent memory—adds to the Crimson’s arsenal on the ice. And ECAC Goaltender of the Year, junior Emerance Maschmeyer—fresh off a season in which she recorded the fourth-best save percentage in the nation—has returned to split time between the pipes alongside sophomore Brianna Laing, who boasted a .974 save percentage in her freshman campaign.
Stone has plenty of puzzle pieces to work with as she jockeys ice time amongst the talented squad.
It could be easy to discount the Crimson after the team’s early season struggles. And it’s still far too early in the year to say for sure whether this team is national championship material. But if anything, the team’s early adversities should bolster the Crimson as it heads into winter, facing the meaty part of its packed Ivy and ECAC schedule.
Here’s to seeing if the puzzle pieces end up fitting just right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One could say that Harvard sophomore Nikki Okwelogu’s shot put and discus career has been successful.
After all, few people can claim to be a California State Champion, Ivy League Champion, Nigerian national champion, African Championship runner-up, Commonwealth Games finalist and World Junior Championship finalist.
Despite these achievements, humility stays at the forefront of the Crimson star, who admitted to being starstruck while competing internationally this summer.
“People that I admired, I was [now] competing against. It was insane,” Okwelogu said. “Looking around [at the] thousands of people in the audience, it was crazy.”
Though Okwelogu has now built a formidable reputation in the shot put and discus world, the roots to her success had a curious start.
PAGING PALAVICINI
A routine visit to the doctor’s at the age of five would initiate a crucial relationship for Nikki, as she met her future high school coach, Martin Palavicini, who worked as a physiologist.
“It was completely coincidental,” Palavicini said. “I met her mom, her, and her sister. It happened that they were in the same public school that I was teaching and coaching, so we spotted her early on.”
After tracking her progress throughout elementary school, Palavicini coached her from middle school through her senior year in high school, watching her develop into a top-five nationally ranked athlete in the shot put and discus.
Though Okwelogu excelled athletically, academics remained important, with both coach and athlete emphasizing success on and off the field.
“The main difficulty we had to face was her high standards in academics,” Palavicini said. “There was a lot of time in AP classes and scholastic work. We were very flexible to make sure she was successful at that end.”
Colleges would end up taking notice of her work ethic on both sides, as more than 80 programs recruited her before she ultimately decided to attend Harvard.
RECORD BREAKER
Okwelogu took Harvard by storm, moving seamlessly to collegiate competition. As a freshman, Okwelogu posted marks of 16.05 meters and 51.14 meters in the shot put and discus, respectively, to place her name on the record boards of the Gordon Indoor Track, a feat no Crimson thrower had accomplished in those events for over 20 years.
“Nikki’s got a great disposition and was able to make the transition better than most,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “She’s able to get the individual coaching attention to develop so she could focus on her strengths.”
In addition to breaking records, the sophomore established herself as the premier thrower in the Ancient Eight, taking home titles in the shot put for both indoors and outdoors, and placing second in the discus for outdoors.
Okwelogu credits a large part of this to the confidence she developed throughout the season.
“Nerves would be a huge factor in every meet,” Okwelogu said. “Over the course of the season I got very comfortable…and learned to trust myself.”
Unlike most Ivy League athletes, her season did not conclude with the collegiate season as she continued on to the international scene.
INTERNATIONAL DUTY
Okwelogu first got the attention of the Nigerian team her junior year when her sister, Nonny, competed for them at the 2012 World Junior Championships. Both were eligible to compete for the US and Nigeria, ultimately choosing their ancestors’ country.
“I wouldn’t have known Nigeria was a possibility if they hadn’t found [Nonny] first,” Okwelogu said. “My mom facilitated, saying, ‘She has a sister who is up and coming, maybe you should look at her too.’”
The coaches kept an eye on her results, inviting her to compete with the Nigerian team this summer, where she would take home the Nigerian National Championship in the shot put and runner-up in discus.
She would follow the performance by being a finalist at the World Junior Championships in the shot put before competing in the biggest event of her career: the Commonwealth Games.
This internationally renowned competition is held by the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of mostly former British territories.
Okwelogu, a last-second addition to the Nigerian roster, was shell-shocked by the magnitude of the games.
“It’s literally like an Olympic games, an opening ceremony and fans everywhere,” Okwelogu said. “I had no idea until I walked into the stadium, and I was supposed to be warming up, but I was just looking around for a solid five minutes.”
The then-rising sophomore would hold her own, placing ninth in a field that included New Zealand’s two-time Olympic champion Valerie Adams.
Okwelogu wrapped up the summer with her first international medal, placing second in the African Championships in the shot put.
OLYMPIC DREAMS
With a taste of international competition and the initial shock gone, Okwelogu now hungers for more, with her sights set on qualifying to the 2015 World Championships and 2016 Olympic Games.
“Now I can see myself as a competitor,” Okwelogu said. “I went to those meets with the mentality that I’m so lucky…but I qualified not performing as well as I could have because I was in shock.”
“The biggest thing for her is to keep doing what she’s been doing,” Saretsky added. “She wants more of it and at the end of the day you’ve got to continue to focus on the process.”
Palavicini believes the girl he met 15 years ago in the small office will continue to shine.
“I still remember that little girl when she was five,” Palavicini said. “From elementary, to junior high and on to college, I look forward to see whatever the future brings for her.”
