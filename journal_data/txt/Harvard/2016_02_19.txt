After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As an opera, “Switch” accomplishes a vast amount of its goals with extraordinary creativity and delicacy. But it has one glaring flaw: its plot. John Aylward may be a fantastic composer, but his new opera, “Switch,” is a reminder of why the libretto and the score are usually the work of different individuals. There’s only so much creative energy one person can muster. The unstable story of “Switch” would have been enough to damn many plays, but "Switch" is redeemed almost wholesale by its marvelous execution.
The opera, running Feb. 12 to 20 at Cambridge’s Le Laboratoire, focuses on the trials and travails of Henry (Mikhail Smigelski), an aspiring playwright who simply cannot complete his latest project until a mysterious woman named Anne (Amanda DeBoer Bartlett), purportedly a friend of his girlfriend Molly, begins to revitalize his work as a muse. As the play progresses, Henry’s relationship with Anne—and Anne’s to the world at large—become increasingly murky. These developments all take place in what the program aptly calls “an alcohol-induced dreamscape.” Though the use of familiar tropes is not, in and of itself, a fault, writers have been writing about how they can’t write for centuries now, and it’s hard to come up with the thousandth variation on a theme that by now feels slightly trite. The plot’s broad themes, too, seem tenuous: The theme of myth, for instance, feels a bit shoehorned in, as though the librettist read a couple Joseph Campbell books a couple nights before finalizing the libretto. The plot is generally weak, starting off with a character we don’t particularly like writing a story that doesn’t get that much better despite repeated bursts of “inspiration,” guided along by advice that either seems obvious or useless.
The scenes are brilliantly realized, with a number of fantastic feats of creative staging. In one scene, Anne seems to climb onto and over Henry, emptying bottle after bottle of whisky onto him; in another, as Henry describes his screenplay to Molly, virginal girls in floral dresses ethereally drift across the set to the fridge only to grab a bottle of Narragansett Lager; in yet another, those same girls, heavily implied to be Anne’s fellow muses, bury a delirious Henry in veritable reams of rough drafts. The individual scenes of the play are immensely evocative and imaginative, with something interesting happening in almost every corner of the set at any given time. “Switch” may have a shaky plot, but it is articulated with extreme finesse.
The set of “Switch” is stunning. Scenic designer Andrea Merkx makes clever use of the Le Laboratoire’s black-box space, creating six distinct islands of visual interest. Two of those areas are occupied by the musical ensemble: In one the percussionist stands surrounded by a dizzying array of instruments, and the conductor, flautist, cellist, and clarinet player, arranged in a loose diamond, occupy the other. The other four spaces are beautifully rendered representations of rooms in Henry’s house. These portions of the set have a warm, modern feel and feature a beautiful selection of bauhaus artifacts, from a wonderfully boxy white coffeemaker to a walnut rolltop desk. The set is immensely detailed, abounding with clever touches—oranges, for example, are dotted around the area as decorative flourish. There’s also, in keeping with the show’s themes, a bottle of booze in every drawer.
Musically, as well, the opera succeeds. The instrumentalists are all tremendously gifted. Flautist Keiko Murakami skillfully played four different varieties of flute, ranging from the piccolo to the alto, and percussionist Mike Truesdell was able to make use of his entire arsenal of marimbas, drums, cymbals, and whole host of other instruments. The musical numbers themselves were innovative and gorgeous, making use of a staggering variety of different sounds—from percussive raps on the cello to low breathy gasps on the alto flute. There are a number of excellent arias in the opera: “Love, Death, Honor, and Truth,” “The Magnets of Euripides,” and “The Ring” are three highlights out of many. The arias do suffer from a bit of fragmentation; Henry and Anne’s singing is sometimes distractingly broken up by dialogue. But this flaw does not detract from the otherwise very proficient score.
Director Laine Rettmer wonderfully fuses music and theater, incorporating each of the musical performers into the action of the stage. Murakami danced and moved with the muses and was heavily implied to be one of them—since with her they numbered nine. And at one point cellist Serafim Smigelskiy (not to be confused with actor Mikhail Smigelski) appears on Henry’s desk, playing his cello as the coquettish Anne languidly wraps herself around him, fingering the notes. Their collaboration grows in tension until Anne, driven to a state of frenzy, pulls the tuning pegs out of his cello and, lifting the instrument above her head, runs offstage, pursued by the worried cellist. After a pause, a loud, wooden crash is heard. The incorporation of the musicians into the drama serves as a fascinating blurring of the fourth wall.
The opera’s acting is, on the whole, mixed. DeBoer Bartlett delivers a tremendous performance, portraying the beleaguered Molly and the maniacally energetic Anne with equal poise. Her body movement is expressive, her singing exceptional, and overall level of energy exceedingly high. Mikhail Smigelski is a phenomenal singer, with a robust, melodious bass-baritone with serious power. However, the opera’s lack of long, uninterrupted arias prevents his singing voice from shining as powerfully and distinctively as it might. His character comes off as stiff, unable to fully deliver the intense ecstasy and frustration to which Henry is supposedly subjected to throughout the course of the play. This criticism is not to serve as a censure of Smigelski; both his thick, hard-to-ignore accent and a certain woodenness inherent in the script contributed to this impression. Smigelski moves well—one of his most arresting scenes shows him putting a beer bottle down with such vehemence that he shatters it, lacerating his hand.
Unfortunately, the intentionality of Henry’s woodenness is unclear. It would certainly mesh with the themes of alienation and failure of expression that suffuse the work. And Henry’s character does possess hints of cluelessness and lack of tact: There is a fantastic scene towards the end of the opera in which he, ignorant of the source of Molly’s distress, can only mention his progress on the project that is so clearly asphyxiating their relationship. If Henry’s flat affect is intentional, it is well done—but it may have been done too strongly, rendering his character unengaging.
In many ways, “Switch” is a masterpiece: It gets almost all the details right, from creative and intricate staging to fantastic blocking to lovely musical nuance. However, overall the opera comes off slightly underwhelming, its small but frequent flares of genius unable to elevate stale themes and wooden characters. The whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts. But for its various excellent individual components, “Switch" is absolutely worth a look.

As they sing, dance, and cast spells on stage, men—some in drag—fight for their right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 168th annual production. Running nearly every night from Feb. 6 through Mar. 6 at Farkas Hall, “That 1770s Show” is a musical set in an alternate version of 1775 Boston. A phenomenal performance overall, “That 1770s Show” excels in all fields thanks to talented actors, exceptional stage direction, and a hilarious script that connects colonial strife of the 1770s to the modern day.
“That 1770s Show” follows Betsy Gloss (Joshuah B. Campbell ’16) and an eclectic band of angry Bostonians in 1775 as they express their frustrations about high taxes through mischief and violence. As Governor Bucky Hampalace (Aaron A. Slipper ’18) ignores the plight of his citizens to tend to his greedy and murderous daughter, Anne Heritance (Daniel S. Milaschewski ’17), Gloss and her friends seek the help of alcoholic and genius inventor Benjamin Dranklin (Daniel E. Hughes ’18) and the governor’s wife, Mae Flower (Dylan J. Peterson ’17), to remedy the issue. However, things take an unexpected twist as Anne Heritance’s giant pet, Codzilla (David A. Sheynberg ’16), finds a way to survive on land and sets out to eat the entire Boston community.
The “That’s 1770s Show” script, written by Milaschewski, Jacob D. Rienstra ’17, and A.J. Unitas ’16, is packed with action, romance, and a strange take on American patriotism. Amid all the events that take place in just a few hours, Hasty Pudding Theatricals still manages to retain the brazen sense of humor for which they are so well known. “That 1770s Show” is especially hilarious when it breaks the fourth wall. Characters warn students of alcoholism as Benjamin Dranklin guzzles down a cocktail, breaking his short-lived sobriety. A quick advertisement to the Harvard Coop is thrown in as actors walk off the stage. The characters even take a ride on the T, its infamous “The next train to Alewife is now arriving” announcement playing in a supposedly technologically unadvanced society.
The script not only manages the balance between reality and fiction well but also excels in challenging trite theater tropes. When characters line up on stage near the end of the show—ready to resolve the story by simply telling the audience what happens to each of them in the future, as many plays do—they are unexpectedly invaded by a new challenger. The musical quickly shifts into a chauvinistic dance sequence that, despite having no words or passage of time, is extremely engaging and aesthetically pleasing. Soldiers in short and sparkly dresses line up in different formations, their coordinated dance steps mimicking a march. They wield white rifles and move across the stage, casting tall silhouettes onto the back wall. Shiny streamers add to the comically patriotic effect, stars move around the stage, and actors perform leg-kicks in perfect unison. The dance reflects the consistently strong stage direction that makes the musical exceptional.
Furthermore, the lighting of “That 1770s Show” maximizes the space’s potential. Light creates different ground textures that mimic the settings of certain scenes—like a Bostonian cobblestone road or a forest floor. Colored lighting also helps to emphasize the emotions felt in different scenes. When a character is attacked by a sea monster offstage, red light flashes with every chomp or scream, leaving much to the imagination. As Anne Heritance is bound by ropes, her internal thoughts are met with a dramatic change in lighting, the blue tint and her echo-like voice mimicking the inside of her mind.
It is the actors’ performances, however, that make the musical whole. The witch Galinda Witchhat (Kyle R. Whelihan ’17) teeters around in high heels, showcasing her ditzy nature without words. Gloss is strong in nature, making her eventual leadership role fitting. Anne Heritance screeches and throws temper tantrums with no restraint, and Mae Flower’s indulgent personality is reflected in the swaying of her hips as her character moves across the stage. Each actor performs his character to the fullest extent. And, as for the music, written by Dylan MarcAurele ’16, the songs are catchy, energetic, and flawlessly executed.
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals delivers on all fronts in its retelling of the start of the Revolutionary War. Strong performances, along with incredible stage direction and an uproarious script, make “That 1770s Show” a professional, lively, and entertaining musical.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who are planning a family saw a bump in their benefits this week when the GSAS administration announced that it will expand its Parental Accommodation and Financial Support Program. With the newly augmented program, students will now receive $6,200 and 12 weeks of time off after giving birth to or adopting a child.
This change is clearly a positive one for students of both GSAS and the College. Since graduate student teaching fellows play such an important role in Harvard's undergraduate experience, dedicating more resources to them is beneficial to the entire academic community. The new policy will also bring parental benefits for Harvard’s graduate students in line with their peers at Columbia, Princeton, and Dartmouth, where 12 weeks of leave are available to new parents. In addition, under Harvard's policy, graduate students will now be able to spread their twelve weeks over the course of an entire year, rather than take it in a single block as required under the old program. This flexibility, combined with the program’s financial subsidy, is a sign that GSAS is pursuing policies with its students’ best interests in mind.
According to Allen Aloise, GSAS’s dean for administration and finance, the Parental Accommodation program was started in 2013 following a collaborative effort between GSAS, the Graduate Student Council, and Harvard Graduate Women in Science and Engineering. Upon revisiting the program two years later, the GSAS administration concluded that students could benefit from more resources. “In hearing and talking to students, we heard that they would appreciate some additional support in this regard, and the Graduate School agreed,” said Aloise. Last year, GSAS spent $155,000 on the program, a figure that is expected to rise both because of the expanded financial benefit and from a larger number of interested students.
More broadly, the process of consultation that led to the revamping of the parental leave policy reflects administrators’ ability to continue improving conditions for graduate students. Despite this commendable advance, graduate students face remaining difficulties that the administration would do well to address. In addition to smaller sections, teaching fellows should receive greater security in funding and teaching assignments, and better training before they take the front of the classroom. These very concerns, among others, precipitated last year's demands for unionization.
It is important to note that the increase in parental benefits happened without the involvement of any sort of union. Still, one administrative success cannot undo the dissatisfaction among students that gave impetus to this movement. Last fall, we argued that unionization was a potential solution to a situation in which Harvard did not have strong enough incentives to respond to graduate students’ concerns. A continued effort on the behalf of administrators to cooperate with students, however, may provide compelling evidence against the proposition that unionization is the most effective means by which graduate students can effect change.
While we are not ready to suggest that such evidence exists at this point, Harvard now has the opportunity to show that it can respond to its graduate students without the presence of a union. To do so, administrators must pursue further reforms in other areas of concern. Until then, graduate students will be justified in their continued efforts to organize.

What I both admire and dislike most about black progressivism is its staunch unwillingness to compromise. Not with the American political process, not with the American people—especially conservatives of color, and certainly not with even more radical strains of progressivism.
At the very least, for a movement with clear political ends, it’s one that is unwilling to navigate by political means.
A few weeks ago, Bernie Sanders spoke out against the demand for reparations—a popular argument that black Americans today should be monetarily compensated for the moral and financial wrongs their ancestors suffered from the dawn of slavery to about the 1960s.
When asked if he believed whether the U.S. government should dole out reparations, Sanders said:
"No, I don’t think so. First of all, its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil. Second of all, I think it would be very divisive. The real issue is when we look at the poverty rate among the African American community, when we look at the high unemployment rate within the African American community, we have a lot of work to do.
"So I think what we should be talking about is making massive investments in rebuilding our cities, in creating millions of decent paying jobs, in making public colleges and universities tuition-free, basically targeting our federal resources to the areas where it is needed the most and where it is needed the most is in impoverished communities, often African American and Latino."
To any early follower of Sanders’s politics, his statement should come as unsurprising. Like many democratic socialists, Sanders prefers to view Americans as populating classes, not races—and like many conservatives incidentally, he views employment as the most effective solution to addressing the litany of woes touted by black and Latino progressives.
After all, “more jobs” was his response to Black Lives Matter before protestors infamously interrupted his rally in Seattle this summer, compelling him to release an official racial justice platform despite little ideological interest among his adherents or, frankly, himself. His nationalist economic populism is similarly the reason why he’s against open borders, albeit less staunchly after Latino progressivism’s poster child Jorge Ramos expressed his chagrin—sure, open borders would boost the livelihoods of poor Hispanics coming into the country, but such a policy would also steal jobs from America’s poor.
Yet for the umpteenth time, black and Latino progressives seethe in outrage at Sanders’s disagreement with them on reparations, feeling blindsided by their sometime-ally’s predictable betrayal, enraged by the notion that progressivism as a political movement can be both palatable and aracial.
To the credit of Ta-Nehisi Coates, who became the first to feign puzzlement over Sanders’s comments with his piece in The Atlantic last month, the pundit later announced that he will nonetheless vote for Sanders when given the chance. But this is more an affirmation of his democratic prerogative than an indication of ideological compromise. Coates made it clear: “I’m not going to make any calls. I’m not going to volunteer. I’m not doing anything. I answered the question because I was asked the question. But, I just want to be clear. I reject the term supporter. I reject the term endorsement. I’m a voter.”
And to the credit of the substance of Coates’s ire, the Senator’s case against reparations is indeed a tad hypocritical. His arguments that a successful reparations bill would be implausible within the political system and would moreover divide the country is a risible affront to the public image of unapologetic radicalism and partisanship he so carefully manicured. Why haven’t implausibility and divisiveness ever disqualified Sanders’s support for single-payer healthcare and unprecedentedly high tax rates?
Unlike Coates, Jamelle Bouie—another pundit at the helm of black progressivism—forgives Sanders’s hypocrisy by chalking it up to the insurmountable clout whites wield on political victories in this country. Sanders must be a pragmatist before Election Day, the argument goes, in order to afford not being one from then on out. That is to say, the Sanders movement necessitates race-based handouts—but Sanders and his supporters, both current and potential, either don’t know or don’t care about this yet.
I think Mr. Bouie is kidding himself. The very lifeblood of black progressivism is its clout, its spectacle, its omnipresence in both intellectual and popular discourse. That’s the reason why it matters that black actors are boycotting the Oscars, that politicians are arguing over Beyoncé’s ode to the black condition, that Kanye can get away with brazenly condemning the "white publication” the New York Times for having the audacity to comment even approvingly on music made by “the great grandson of an ex slave.” Frankly, that’s the reason why Sanders released a racial justice platform and softened his rhetoric on closed borders despite his conscience.
Based on the evangelical powers of black progressivism, I wouldn’t put it past Sanders to come out in favor of reparations tomorrow. If he does, it’s because he’s playing his cards right—not because all progressivism must be black progressivism, the myth so many like Coates and Bouie attempt to perpetuate. And if he doesn’t, he’ll simply prove that black progressivism transcends politics. It’s an ideological exercise in special-interest radicalism that not even a man who wants a 90 percent tax rate is willing to support.

America is at war with itself over the dictionary. I’m not talking about political correctness—the idea that we should avoid offensive language for its own sake. I’m talking about the metaphors that are the currency of our politics: terms like “illegals” for undocumented immigrants or “tax relief” for promised tax credits. The phrases repeated so often that they become cliché. 
I’m going to argue that as these formulations enter political discourse, they evoke images that can color our political consciences—for example, of Mexicans as law-breakers and taxes as heavy burdens. And that whenever we participate in a political debate, we bolster one side or the other with the words we use to express our position.
To argue politics persuasively, be strategic about the language you use.
The debate over immigration reform exemplifies the power of language to frame the nature of the policy problem. Turn on talk radio or go to a Trump rally, and you’ll hear the people under discussion referred to with phrases like “illegal immigrants,” “illegal aliens,” or even just “illegals.” Language like this ignores the human context in which immigrants live and make choices. Instead, it suggests that they should be identified and labeled based on a single binary: their relationship to American immigration law. It is the ultimate form of other-ing, making callous formulations like Trump’s possible: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”
More humane terms like “undocumented immigrant,” “undocumented worker,” or “asylum seeker” suggest that the debate over immigration policy is about something completely different. They categorize immigrants in terms of their willingness to work, the danger or poverty in their home country, and their affection for American values. And they imply that when men and women decide to cross the border “without documents,” they do so often for the safety and welfare of their families. Gone is the insinuation that immigrants feel a sense of entitlement, or disrespect the rule of law.
What do Americans think about immigration reform? It all depends on how you phrase the question. An April poll from Rasmussen Reports found that, by a 56-35 margin, Americans disapprove of President Obama’s “amnesty” policy that allows “illegal immigrants…to remain in this country legally and apply for jobs.” But a Gallup study from August found that 65 percent—including the majority of Republicans—favor a substantially similar policy if it is described as a “pathway to citizenship.” The fate of ten million people may well hang on which phrase wins out.
Metaphor may matter even more when we conceptualize abstract policy questions. As Nicholas Kristof has argued, liberal rhetoric surrounding the contentious issue of “gun control” implies that Democrats want the government to control who can own a gun, or ban guns altogether. These narratives blend with the visual image of the government taking control of people's guns, becoming so closely associated that merely uttering the words "gun control" becomes counterproductive.
Surveys show that most gun owners support common sense restrictions on firearms. (For some perspective, only 6 to 7 percent of American gun owners are N.R.A. members.) But once a cognitive frame is established in which “gun control” equates to gun confiscation, moderates are prompted to respond emotionally rather than rationally. Perhaps this is why Congress has taken no action in three years since Sandy Hook, even though 89 percent of Americans support requiring background checks at gun shows. That’s why Kristof suggests ditching the phrase, and saying “gun safety” instead. Linguistic precision barely figures into it; we should care about the results.
Movements to change the language we use have already had an impact. In 2013, a petition demanding that leading news agencies stop using the term “illegal immigrant” gathered over 70,000 signatures. In response, the AP changed its style guide. The New York Times stopped short of a full-scale ban, but put limits on the phrase’s use. The debate continues today, as millions of Syrian migrants—or should I say “refugees”—pour into Europe.
Debates like this convince me that, despite all its flaws, the culture of political correctness has been a good thing for our society. By forcing us to recognize the harm our words can do, it has taught us to think before speaking, and to own the vocabulary we use. Now it is time for us to aim higher—to pay attention to our language because we want it to describe our values, not just because we fear causing offense.
In his famous essay, “Politics and the English Language,” George Orwell argued that the most fundamental terms in our political discourse—socialist, fascist, middle class—have become muddled almost to the point of meaninglessness. “What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way around,” Orwell wrote. “In prose, the worst thing you can do with words is to surrender to them.”
Whatever our politics, let’s stop surrendering to words, and start talking about what they’re actually saying.

To the editor:
Tuesday’s op-ed lamenting “Harvard’s Wall Street Problem” takes a myopic view towards Harvard’s “academic and civil focus”.
I shall address the civil focus first. The author envisions an ideal Harvard as one where “world-changers are created, polished, and sent out into the world with a sense of purpose,” and calls upon Harvard to subsidize students entering the public sector to stem the flow of graduates into the financial industry. But perhaps by focusing first on accumulating human, social, and financial capital to be deployed later in life, young graduates entering finance can make a substantially larger impact over the course of their lifetimes than if they had jumped into public service immediately after college. At the extremes, it is not unreasonable to think that a single Warren Buffet could create as much positive impact as many, many employees in the public sector. The world-changers that the author wishes to see ought to seek to do the greatest good for the world, not only in the years immediately following graduation but also over their entire lives.
Moreover, it is not even obvious that public service is the most impactful career in the years after graduation. Though the author portrays Wall Street as having “highly questionable social impact”, there is evidence to suggest that broad swathes of the public sector should also be characterized as such. Meanwhile, high-earning graduates will have access to more capital to do good than graduates in other industries. Of course, not every financier is earning to give, nor is monetary philanthropy the only way to better the world; nevertheless, the view that working in the public sector after graduation is the only means of doing good is a blatantly unreflective stance.
The author further claims that the finance recruiting process “diminishes the academic culture of our campus” and discourages the pursuit of passions when they “no longer seem marketable.” It is not clear to me that finding a job as a fundraising manager for a charity has any more ties with the ivory tower than trading at a hedge fund.
I am also not sure that passion (for things other than money) is non-marketable to finance firms: My secondary field in philosophy was a specific point of excitement in my finance interviews. More generally, if the ultimate goal of Harvard is to create positive change-makers, it is not obvious that creating “post-graduate programs that foster participants’ passions” is the best way to do so—I have a hard time discerning whether spending a year researching snails on the Australian coast will increase one’s lifetime contribution to society any more than going into finance.
I don’t claim to know how we can best honor Harvard’s mission statement and the education we’ve been lucky enough to receive. But to suggest unconditionally that finance is “soul-crushing” and fundamentally incompatible with moral leadership, as the author has, is an overly simplistic view of what doing good and changing the world really means.

Taxis in Greater Boston have recently partnered with “Curb,” a ride-hailing app similar to ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft, in an effort to remain competitive.
Jason M. Gross ’94, head of product and marketing at Verifone, the company behind Curb, described the app as a “ride-hailing app that allows you to hail a nearby taxi or actually book it for the future.”
Tensions between taxi drivers and ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft have exacerbated in recent months, coming to a head last September when drivers attended a City Council meeting requesting that lawmakers regulate the industry.
Similar tensions have come to the fore both nationally and around the world as the taxi industry has been slow to react to the rapid rise in popularity of ride-sharing services. The lack of regulation for ride-sharing services has been at the center of taxi drivers’ concerns, sparking debate in local and state governments.
“There's a very fair and reasonable outcry,” Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, who worked closely with taxi drivers throughout the fall, said. “My response was really: ‘You improve your service, and we’ll be there to help.’”
The council passed a resolution in September requesting that Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and state legislators pass a bill to regulate ride-sharing services.
The 2015 resolution, sponsored by former Councillor Dennis Benzan and then-councillor E. Denise Simmons, who is now Cambridge mayor, supported state legislation that would allow taxis and ride-sharing companies “to operate on a fair and even plane throughout the Commonwealth.”
The Massachusetts House of Representatives is expected to act on multiple proposals on the issue later this month, in the hopes of reaching a compromise accepted by both ride-sharing companies and taxi drivers.
Gross said he  thought  the convenience provided by ride-sharing apps is in part responsible for the shift in popularity from taxi services to ride-sharing services.
"People come to expect a certain level of convenience,” he said. “What we are trying to do is support the taxi industry and make it competitive, from the standpoint of providing all that same convenience and ease.”
With the introduction of Curb, Mazen hopes that customers will support local taxi drivers, in an effort to help their neighbors.
“The taxi industry needed to take a really hard look in the mirror and see why people were going for Uber,” he said. “It was the accessibility paired with the experience.”
Gross said the two industries are complementary and help to serve different sectors of the population.
“Different people choose different forms of transportation for a variety of reasons,” he said. “It would be very difficult to imagine a city or a world without taxis, where the only people able to get transportation are people with a smartphone, people with high disposable income who are price insensitive to [surge pricing].”

Harvard student groups are continuing to focus their efforts in Massachusetts for their respective candidates prior to Saturday’s caucuses in Nevada and upcoming primary elections in South Carolina.
On the Democratic side, Harvard Students for Bernie have “had a lot of momentum” after Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’s victory in the New Hampshire primaries, Justin G. Curtis ’19, vice president of the group, said. This week, the organization made hundreds of calls to voters in Nevada during two phone banks that the organization held this week.
“In the next couple of weekends we’ll be canvassing in Massachusetts in preparation for Super Tuesday,” Curtis said. “It’s a lot easier to get kids to canvass around Harvard than in New Hampshire.” 
Harvard Students For Hillary have continued holding phone banks and hosting canvassing trips to rally support for former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton.
Thanks to advice from the Clinton campaign, which has a “robust operation in Nevada and South Carolina,” the student group has primarily made calls to Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts, board member Sarah E. Graham ’17 said.
“Maine is a caucus state and they typically have low turnout, so we feel like we can really make a difference there,” she said.
The group has planned canvassing trips around Cambridge during the two weekends leading to Super Tuesday—on which about a dozen states hold caucuses and primaries—and on the actual day of the primary election.
“I feel that as a group we have been putting in a lot of effort,” Graham said. “We’re pretty optimistic about the results.”
Harvard Republicans are regrouping after canvassing in New Hampshire for several weeks, according to Gwen R. Thomas ’17, Harvard Republican Club president.
“Everyone is just waiting to see how things play out,” Thomas said.
Currently, Donald J .Trump leads nations polls and many Harvard Republicans are uneasy about the possibility of the controversial businessman becoming their party’s nominee.
Last semester, the Republican Club conducted an internal straw poll, and those who voted were split nearly 50-50 between Florida senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush for primary election. Currently, Bush places fifth in delegate count, lagging behind other establishment competitors Rubio and Ohio Governor John Kasich in national polls.
Thomas, who said she is uncertain how club members’ opinions have changed since their first poll, said the group will conduct another straw poll to gauge preferences as the number of candidates whittle down.
Recent CNN/ORC polls in Nevada show Clinton and Sanders in dead heat at 48 and 47 percent respectively amongst Democratic voters. On the Republican side, the South Carolina race is less contentious, with Trump leading the polls at 38 percent to Texas Senator Ted Cruz’s 22 percent. Rubio lags further behind at 14 percent.

Political aspirants beware: heads of state live 2.7 years less than runner-up candidates who never serve in office, according to a December study led by a Harvard Medical School professor.
Anupam B. Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, led the study, which was published in the British Medical Journal. Observing the rapid onslaught of wrinkles and gray hair in many a once-youthful presidential hopeful, people have long speculated that presidents in office age faster than the average citizen, Jena said.
“Looking at presidents before they take office and when they leave has been used by some people as anecdotal evidence of accelerated aging,” Jena said.
Yet despite apparent popular agreement, scientific discussions of this phenomenon were far from conclusive. A 2011 study found no evidence that presidents die sooner than anyone in the general population. In the same year, however, other news outlets cited wellness experts who estimated that the typical American president ages two years for every one served in office.
Jena and his team recognized what  they thought were a number of flaws in the experimental approach of the 2011 study that might have contributed to its surprising conclusion.
“It’s intuitive that you shouldn’t compare a world leader to the general population,” he said. He added that presidents should be expected to outlive average life expectancies given their higher socioeconomic status and superior access to health care.
The 2011 investigation also focused on American presidents alone rather than examining a larger sample of world leaders. Such a small group, Jena said, was hardly “enough to find a statistically significant effect.”
The research team hoped to remedy these faults with a new approach. Rather than using the general population as a standard for comparison, the researchers thought it would be more revealing to examine runner-up candidates as political leaders of a similar socioeconomic status.
The team also examined a broader sample of world leaders than existing studies had used. Pooling historical election data from 17 different countries and spanning nearly three centuries, the researchers came up with 540 suitable candidates. They then observed the number of years the candidates lived after their last election relative to historical life expectancies for people of the same age and sex.
In addition to the shorter life expectancy the study discovered, a proportional hazards test the researchers conducted found that successful candidates also had a 23 percent increase in mortality risk.
The researchers said they were not surprised by their findings.
“When so many people think that something is happening, my a priori belief is that it’s probably happening,” Jena said.

An application developed by a Harvard undergraduate will allow students to place dining hall grill orders remotely through their electronic devices in order to reduce crowding and save time for students.
The application, called Mange, is currently being piloted at Cabot House. If successful, it will be introduced in all Harvard dining halls by the end of the year, according to HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
Created by Enrique A. Dominguez-Meneses ’16, Harvard students can log in with their emails through the website mangeapp.com. Dominguez-Meneses said he is planning to launch the app on iOS and Android application stores in the near future.
Once registered, students can use their accounts to place orders from remote locations or at the counter itself. The application will then notify HUDS chefs of the order.
“Before, you would get up two, three times to see when your grill order was ready.” Dominguez-Meneses said. “Now, when your order is done, you’ll get an email or text notification to tell you.”
He added that the app will hopefully help save time for hungry students and reduce crowding in the dining halls, especially at the grill counters.
“By reducing crowds of people ordering at the counter using paper slips, it clears a lot of room in the dining hall for when other foods need to be delivered,” said William A. Campbell, a HUDS employee at Cabot.
Students said they found the app useful for helping them remember what they initially ordered.
“I usually make a grill order, forget it’s done, and never pick it up,” said Juliana Castrillon ’17. “This helps me with picking it up consistently.”
The app also displays the HUDS grill menus for each day, allowing users to order grills ahead of time if they prefer the food options of another day.
HUDS employees who work at the grill said the app has facilitated their administrative record-keeping, from tracking food orders to creating inventories.
“The most important thing is good accounting, and this app helps us to tally up the food at the end of the day,” said Abdelkader Mouhoub, a HUDS employee at Cabot.
The app also aims to reduce food waste by discouraging the practice of leaving grill orders unattended. If a student abandons grill orders twice, he or she will forfeit the right to order remotely.
"The goal is that, by getting a little ding, students will go and pick up their grill orders with more frequency,” Martin said.
Dominguez-Meneses, who codes as a hobby, said he hopes his invention will inspire other students to create applications that facilitate the use of social and recreational spaces at Harvard.
“On campus, my ideas for projects have come through observation—putting myself in other people’s shoes and realizing what I have to worry about,” he said. “I think this app can reduce food waste, wait time, improve the dining experience, and HUDS in general.”

Harvard has partnered with the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation to form a novel homeownership initiative intended to stymie a destabilizing trend—the increasing number of transient renters in the Allston-Brighton area.
A few months ago, Bettina Hein, founder and CEO of a YouTube advertising technology company, was reaching the end of her rope. Hein, who at that time lived in Cambridge with her husband and two young children, was struggling to find a new house in Brighton.
Hein finally found the perfect home, located within a seven-minute walk of the school her children will attend, only to be outbid. 
“The market is really tight in that area,” Hein said. “There’s about an average of one house a month coming on the market.”
Though she did not know it then, Hein had been outbid by the ABCDC, an organization dedicated to creating affordable housing and educating first-time home buyers, which bought the house as part of its All Bright Homeownership Program.
So far, the homeownership initiative has bought three homes and resold two, according to  Valerie K. Frias, the associate director of the ABCDC. One of those ended up being Bettina Hein’s dream home, which she eventually bought.
The ABCDC initiative began as an idea roughly four years ago and was first implemented last summer, Frias said. Overseen directly by the ABCDC, the program buys up homes in Allston and Brighton and resells them under an owner-occupancy deed restriction, which stipulates that the owner must live on the property.
“The goal is to increase owner occupancy and stability to bring a real sense of community,” Frias said. She added that the program “is designed to essentially stem the investor trends in the north Allston, north Brighton neighborhood.”
In recent years, investors both foreign and domestic have come to dominate the housing market in Allston and Brighton, overpaying for area homes with ready cash and then converting them to profitable rental units.
Recognizing investors’ chokehold on the market, Harvard “committed to contribute” to the new homeownership program after discussions with local residents, according to Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke. The University donated $3 million to the initiative as part of its community benefits package, detailed in the master plan for its Allston developments.
“Harvard provided [the] grant money that became the foundation for the program,” said Sarah Kitterman, senior loan officer at Boston Community Capital, a nonprofit community development financial institution that backs the homeownership initiative.
Kitterman said Harvard’s $3 million constituted a “critical layer of equity capital” which the ABCDC could then leverage to raise more money. Armed with Harvard funding, the fledgling program approached BCC for a loan.
BCC did not disappoint, providing up to $5 million for a line of credit. In total, the homeownership program has easy access to $8 million, enabling it to act “very quickly” when purchasing property and thus making the program competitive with cash-paying investors, according to Kitterman.
“This program is the first of its kind in the nation,” O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement. “[It] exemplifies the real impact that can emerge from leveraging shared resources.”
Indeed, the program has already had made an impact. Just weeks after outbidding the Heins for the house, the ABCDC put the property up for sale again. “We were thrilled,” Hein said.
Despite an increase in price, Hein and her husband jumped at the opportunity to buy the house after meeting with Frias and learning about the homeownership program.
“Did I resent having to pay 40 grand more than I wanted to? Yeah,” said Hein. “But I got the house I wanted and I do think it’s in general a good thing for the neighborhood, I’m super happy that they’re doing this.”
She added that the program must walk “a fine line” in future, taking care not to drive up prices in the area to the detriment of lower-income families. In the end, however, she said she believes the program’s positive impact outweighs any increase in prices.
Upon learning of Harvard’s role in the program, Hein laughed.
“Honestly, Harvard is a contributor to the price inflation [here],” she said. “So I think they’re wise to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past two years at the University’s Title IX office have been anything but calm. From sweeping Title IX policy overhauls to two federal investigations, student protests, and task force meetings, various groups have continually criticized Harvard's response to sexual assault.
Amid heightened external and internal pressures, a recent federal lawsuit filed by Alyssa R. Leader ’15  stands to further scrutinize how Harvard administrators have handled sexual assault on campus. On Tuesday, Leader filed the suit, alleging that Harvard mishandled her 2015 sexual harassment complaint and denied her request to remove an unnamed male perpetrator, referred to as “John Doe,” from Cabot House.
The case is far from the first time that Harvard has faced scrutiny over sexual assault. As undergraduates held rallies to protest sexual assault training and resources, a 2015 University-wide survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate female respondents at the College said they had experienced some form of sexual assault during their time on campus. 
Leader’s suit alleges that Harvard violated Title IX, the anti-sex discrimination law, and failed to prevent retaliation after she reported her case to several University administrators. Leader reported her case to the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution in February 2015, prompting a formal investigation into the complaint, according to the suit. Leader also reported her case to Harvard University Police Department and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
In all instances, Leader alleges, administrators failed to protect her against sexual harassment and misinformed her of her legal rights.
Only after Leader independently obtained a restraining order against Doe did Harvard move him to another House, the suit claims. And after both students graduated from the College, the ODR found Doe “Not Responsible” for any of Leader’s claims.
Framing her suit around ongoing student criticism to Harvard’s Title IX compliance, Leader said she hopes the litigation will put more pressure on administrators to prevent sexual assault and effectively handle investigations.
“The main thing that I really want to see is accountability for how [Harvard] treated me and so many other survivors over the years,” she said in an interview.
In an emailed statement Wednesday, Rakesh Khurana, the Dean of the College and a Cabot House master, wrote that he could not comment on pending litigation and Harvard administrators “take seriously and swiftly respond to all allegations of sexual assault and harassment.”
Several Title IX legal experts predicted that Leader’s lawsuit will further complicate ongoing debates over whether universities nationwide, including Harvard, have violated Title IX.
Although the University overhauled its sexual harassment policy and procedures in 2014 and further revised them after the Law School was found in violation of Title IX, New England School of Law professor Wendy Murphy said Leader’s lawsuit questions whether the new policies are effective in practice.
“The one issue I have with all of the schools, including Harvard, is going to be implementation,” said Murphy, who filed a federal Title IX complaint against the Law School in 2010. “I don’t know enough about the specific case to advance the plaintiff’s position… but I know that if the facts alleged turn out to be true, I think Harvard has a problem with implementation.”
Still, Leader’s lawsuit may not directly affect an ongoing federal investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance if the government is already examining Leader’s case as part of the larger probe, S. Daniel Carter, an independent campus safety consultant, said.
“The investigations they’re conducting now are far more exhaustive and wide ranging, examining how institutions collectively respond to institutional violence,” he said.
Regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome, Leader’s case could also clarify broader requirements for accommodations that universities must provide to students during a sexual assault investigation under Title IX.
Carter said he found it peculiar that, according to the lawsuit, Harvard had not forced Doe to move out of Leader’s House, an accommodation he called “a staple with Title IX compliance for decades.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said it is not uncommon for universities to enforce Title IX differently and respond to accommodation requests on an individual basis.
“It’s really unclear exactly how this will all end up,” Lake said. “People will be watching this.”

Scientist James D. Watson, best known for receiving the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the co-discovery of DNA with Francis Crick, reflected on his life experiences and gave general advice on success at a lecture Thursday.
The lecture, organized by Andrew Barry, lecturer in Organismic & Evolutionary Biology, attracted approximately 150 students to Harvard’s Science Center.
 
Watson gave advice geared toward undergraduate students by coming up with a list of rules that he has gathered in his personal life. He had 100 such rules and recounted their origins, starting with his experience growing up on the southside of Chicago. Striking a humorous tone, he first advised students to avoid fighting bigger boys or dogs.
Watson delved into his undergraduate experience at the University of Chicago, offering tailored advice to college students in the audience.
“College is for learning how to think and the second rule is knowing ‘why’ an idea is more important than learning ‘what’,” Watson said.
He then described taking courses in zoology, his undergraduate major and a subject he is passionate about.
“The great thing about biology is that you always know that you are right,” Watson said.
Speaking about his own personal success, Watson repeatedly stressed a simple maxim: “you shouldn’t do anything unless you want to win.”
Moreover, he stated his belief in the importance of finding good mentors and partners for collaboration, both of which are factors he attributed to his success. He listed many famous figures, including Salvador E. Luria and Maurice H.F. Wilkins, as people with whom he has developed close relationships and helped him in his scientific career.
When asked about scientific findings that would be as revolutionary as the discovery of DNA, Watson spoke about insights that could arise from uncovering how information is sorted in the human brain. This topic is personal to Watson since he has a son with a mental illness.
To many in the audience, Watson served as an inspiration and role model in terms of his approach to his work and his accomplishments.
“I found Dr. Watson’s speech and advice incredibly inspirational. He mixed life advice with humorous stories and opinions about current events,” Anthony Bogachev ’19 said.

After the release of Datamatch pairings, compatible students have scheduled their free meals at Zinnekens, El Jefe’s, Clover, and Pinkberry.
Frank J. Mendoza, manager of Pinkberry in Harvard Square, commented on the influx of visitors to the frozen yogurt joint since February is typically its slow season.
“[On Tuesday] we had about 10 couples throughout the day,” Mendoza said. “We still have customers, but more are coming in because of Datamatch.”
He said that the store did not need to stock up on extra yogurt despite the recent demand among students.
The assistant manager of Mexican restaurant El Jefe’s, Patricia Flores, reported hosting 12 couples as of Wednesday afternoon, a number that she said is “not overwhelming.” She added that typically three or four couples come eat at the restaurant at the same time.
“Overall, they don’t know each other,” Flores said of the Datamatch couples. “I’ve seen some couples shake hands, and say ‘oh hey, how are you?’”
Datamatch, sponsored by the Harvard Computer Society, creates compatible pairings among undergraduates through an online survey and associated algorithm, additionally offering couples the opportunity to recieve free food. This year, questions for the online survey were developed by writers from Satire V, an undergraduate humor magazine, with the input of Psychology professor Steven A Pinker. More than 3,300 students participated in the survey this year.
Sathvik R. Sudireddy ’19 said he was matched with someone he had never met before.
“She contacted me and from there it was just a natural conversation,” Sudireddy said. “We just made that arrangement and the plans, and that’s it.”
Sudireddy added he and his match have only communicated through Facebook messenger, and they will first meet at El Jefe’s on Friday.
“I think we will have a good conversation and it will be fun getting free tacos. It’s always nice meeting new people and making new friends,” he said.
Some students said their Datamatch results cataloged familiar names. Julia E. Belanoff ’18 said she was matched with another student from her freshman dorm entryway.
“I was kind of surprised, but if you’re going to eat free food you might as well do it with someone you know you like,” Belanoff said. She added that even if she had not known her match, she still would have gone on the date.
“It’s fun to have the excuse to meet someone you don’t know, and Datamatch is the funny ‘how I made new friends’ story,” she said.
Other students commented on the casual nature of their dates.
“If it was a real date, I would have worn make-up and not have been late. This was an eyeliner-less date,” Tanner E. Skenderian ’16, who went on a breakfast date at Clover, said.
Both students and restaurant-owners alike appear satisfied with the Datamatch project this year.
“It’s very cool and interactive,” Flores said. “It’s very cute and nice to see.”

Harvard’s Memorial Church is slated to undergo renovations that will increase accessibility to the building, improve sustainability standards, and establish a new student space in the center of campus.
The project is tentatively expected to cost between $10 and $15 million, according to Harvard Divinity School professor and Pusey Minister in Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton. The cost could be met through a variety of potential sources, including Memorial Church’s own savings from recent decades, funding from the Harvard Office of Sustainability, and even contributions from other Harvard bodies including the Central Administration or the Business School, according to Walton.
Dedicated in 1932 to honor Harvard affiliates who died during World War I, Memorial Church hosts a wide array of events, including weekly religious services, group performances, and meetings for student groups. 
According to Walton, the church has a moral imperative to make the building more accessible to Harvard students.
“This is a beautiful building, with all of this expensive architecture and organ, but if it’s not comfortable and conducive to the community? … I think that this building is made for the students of Harvard, and so, as much as we could make sure that all students feel welcome here, that they don’t have to feel marginalized because of our lack of accessibility currently,” Walton said.
Early planning stages have deemed that structural changes to the building will be necessary. The church’s current layout poses an obstacle to those who need to use the church ramp and an elevator in the basement to reach the sanctuary. According to Walton, these accessibility concerns become particularly salient and problematic during large campus events such as Freshman Convocation.
“To me, that’s dehumanizing. It’s disrespectful and it’s dehumanizing, and I would say, borderline discriminatory,” he said.
Renovations will also introduce a displacement air conditioning system to the chapel space, which will channel cool air up through existing vents in the floor to create “cool zones” in the church’s pews, Walton said. 
Walton added that the building’s current air conditioning only exists in the church’s basement, which has dissuaded summer events, such as weddings, from being hosted due to the heat accumulation in the sanctuary. The new renovations are expected to save energy and money being lost in the building’s current climate control system.
The retooling of the church’s infrastructure will require contractors to gut the basement, which also creates an opportunity to redesign the space to be more suitable and accessible for student use.
Through meetings with architects in charge of the project, members of the Memorial Church Student Advisory Board have given some input on the basement redesign, according to Karen-Alexandra Nogues ’18, a member of the board.
Nogues added that students have expressed a desire for more discussion spaces and an accessible kitchen that would create a “lounge space” for students.
“We’re lucky in the sense that it’s a central location in Harvard Yard,” Nogues said. “We’re looking for ways in which students can find the space even more useful during the day.”
The Student Advisory Board hopes to transform the church basement into a go-to social space and study lounge.
Scott Hosch ’16, who represents Harvard Christian Impact & Athletes in Action on the board said, “I think one of the big goals of the renovations is making Memorial Church... a more welcoming place for students, where no matter what time during the week, you can go in there and be accessible to the chaplains, and just have a place to study or hang out.”
Harvard Divinity School's Andover Hall, a major campus thoroughfare, will also undergo significant renovations.

In response to requests by Congressional leaders to increase the degree of federal oversight for large university endowments, Harvard has indicated it will work with Congress to provide more clarity and information regarding the use of its endowment resources.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Congressman Thomas W. Reed II, and Congressman Kevin P. Brady sent a letter on Feb. 8 to 56 colleges and universities in the United States with endowments over $1 billion requesting information on the usage of endowment resources, particularly focusing on financial aid.
“Despite these large and growing endowments, many colleges and universities have raised tuition far in excess of inflation,” the chairmen wrote in the letter.
In recent months, Reed has sponsored a bill in Congress that would effectively force universities with large endowments, such as Harvard, to spend a minimum of 25 percent of their endowment income on providing financial aid in order to keep their 501(c)3 tax-exempt statuses.
Harvard, which manages a $37.6 billion endowment, has repeatedly argued against such measures. Faust has stressed that Harvard is uniquely positioned to effect change, through its students and its research, around the world. 
“When we see what we’re not able to do, and what would be possible, that’s how we justify that [endowment],” Faust said in 2014.
Still, Harvard has indicated it will work with Congress to provide more information about how it uses its endowment.
“We look forward to working with the committees and providing clarity on the strong financial management practices governing the endowment and the positive impact it has for students, faculty, researchers and society,” Harvard spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email.
Over the last year, a number of competing proposals debate how to best to hold large, wealthy university endowments accountable to the American public. Mark S. Schneider, a vice president at the American Institutes for Research, said that instead of the Reed plan, the wealthiest universities should be subject to an excise tax, with the revenue generated going toward community colleges across the country in need of financial support.
“What the Reed plan would really do is just reshuffle wealth among a very small pool of schools.” Schneider said. “If top tier students are going to be wealthy after graduation, why should the public be subsidizing them?”
At the core of Schneider’s argument is the fiscal inequality that exists among American universities. He also questioned why unrestricted gifts and restricted gifts, the latter offering more benefit to the donor, are considered equal under the U.S. tax code.
Harvard Law School professor Thomas J. Brennan, a taxation expert, said that Congress has the power to reclassify these large universities as private foundations instead of public charities.
This reclassification, according to Brennan, would enable Congress to enforce expenditure requirements, which are applied to private non-profit organizations like the Gates Foundation. Public charities are not required to use a particular amount of their funds each year.
“Expanding taxation to private university endowments could lead to dangerous slippery slope. If endowments can be taxed, what about pension funds?” Brennan said.
Brennan added that the threat of the government taking a cut of endowments might lead to a decrease in contributions to universities.
“If people begin to think that their donation is at risk of being redistributed by the government towards a different use, it would have a chilling effect… on future donations towards and all sorts of things,” he said. “The idea of the federal government interfering with free markets this way scares me.”
Brennan said that recent trends of corporate tax inversions should act as a warning for U.S. policymakers threatening new taxation efforts.
“We are living in a very global, competitive environment. If the federal government begins limiting their support of top universities, there are other countries that want to pick up the slack.”

A recent Harvard Medical School study shed light on how to avoid injuries while running, showing that people who land lightly on their feet are less likely to injure themselves.
The study, which was led by Irene S. Davis, a visiting professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School, aimed to determine whether runners who land on their feet more heavily are at greater risk for developing medically diagnosed injuries.
The study, which Davis called “innovative,” investigated runners who had never been injured before, a group that has always been understudied in scientific literature, she said.
“We can learn as much from people who never get injured as we can from people who do. That way we can see what the uninjured are doing right,” said Davis, who also serves as the director of the Spaulding National Running Center, a Harvard-affiliated research and treatment facility for running related injuries.
In order to examine the relationship between mechanics and impact load, the study recruited 249 female recreational runners who struck the ground with their heels while running. Landing on heels poses a greater risk of injury than landing on middle or front of the foot, because it results in a stronger impact force, according to the authors.
The participants ran a minimum of 20 miles a week and reported to a biomechanic lab where they recorded their past injuries and ran on a track that could detect the impact force of their foot strike. The researchers tracked the mileage and any running related injury of the runners monthly through a web-based, database programme for two years.
While 103 runners reported injuries that required them to seek medical attention, 21 runners reported of no injuries whatsoever, the study found. The researchers observed that the runners who reported to have never been injured landed very lightly even though they landed on their heels, suggesting that the impact of the landing is an important factor for injuries.
Although the participants of the study were all women, Davis said that preliminary data suggests there are no differences in foot strike impacts between men and women. Davis added that she is currently conducting another study that investigates the differences in foot strike impacts between men and women.
As spring arrives in Cambridge and people take to the streets in their running shoes, they should remember that being light on their feet can help prevent injuries, Davis said.
“People should really try to listen to their foot strikes and try to make them as soft as possible,” Davis said. “Sound is correlated to force, so if you’re hitting really hard it’s going to be loud and that’s a nice way to know when to reduce those impacts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michelle A. Williams, an epidemiologist and professor at the School of Public Health, will lead the school as its next dean beginning in July, becoming the first black person to head a faculty at Harvard and the first female dean of the school.
Williams will take the reins from David J. Hunter, who has served as interim dean since Julio Frenk left the School of Public Health last year after six years as dean to become the president of the University of Miami. She assumes the position in the midst of the University’s ongoing capital campaign, as the school allocates a record-setting $350 million gift from billionaire benefactor Gerald L. Chan. 
“She is a skilled builder of bridges—between the theoretical and the practical, the domestic and the international, the different disciplines that drive the School’s academic endeavors, and the different communities that shape its identity and aspirations,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement about Williams’s appointment. “I know she will approach her new role with the intelligence, dedication, integrity, and humane spirit that she brings to all she does.”
After earning her undergraduate degree at Princeton and a masters degree at Tufts, Williams attended the School of Public Health and later joined the faculty at the University of Washington. Since 2011, Williams has served as the chair of the epidemiology department at the School of Public Health, researching infant and maternal health across continents. She is the principal investigator of three projects funded by the National Institutes of Health.
“As an alumna and faculty member, I have witnessed the transformative impact that this institution can have in education, research, and discovery related to the health of communities in need,” Williams said in a statement. “We have an imperative to lead and to serve, and I am looking forward to working even more closely with the School’s faculty, students, staff, and alumni to build on the School’s achievements.”
Williams’s appointment comes as some students at Harvard’s graduate and professional schools have called for more diversity in the leadership of the University. Students at Harvard Medical School recently delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall, calling on Faust to prioritize making the school more diverse during the search for their own new dean.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 19, 2016, at 5:02 a.m.
After starting the month as the No. 7/7 squad in the country, the No. 13/13 Harvard men’s hockey team has slipped down the national rankings in recent weeks. In February, the Crimson has lost four of its six games, including defeats at the hands of unranked Northeastern and RPI. Three points separate the team from losing its position of notching a first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament.
This weekend does not make matters any easier.
With the Ivy League title on the line, the Crimson welcomes rival No. 16/- Cornell and Colgate to the Bright-Landry Center, as the squad looks to reverse course and secure its spot atop the ECAC standings.
“We know coming down the stretch that these games will be tough,” Harvard coach Ted Donato '91 said. “And going into the playoffs, [the games will] be emotional, there will be overtimes, there will be a lot of energy spent.”
Skating at home has not seemed to give the Crimson (14-8-3, 10-5-3 ECAC) a boost against the Big Red (12-8-5, 7-7-4) in recent years, as Cornell has taken the last seven matchups in Cambridge. Cornell perhaps benefits from the mobility of the Big Red faithful, who have been known to make their presence known in the annual rivalry game at the Bright. Hopes are high for Harvard as a win would secure the Ivy League title, an accolade that has eluded the has eluded the Crimson’s grasp over the last 10 years.
“We’ve got a big four points [this] week,” freshman Ryan Donato said. “Hopefully we’ll clinch the Ivy League.”
Cornell, much like the Crimson, has had a February to forget. After playing No. 1/1 Quinnipiac to a draw, the Big Red has only notched one win this month—a narrow 1-0 victory against cellar-dweller Princeton. The defense has propped up Cornell into the national ranks, as the defensive unit has allowed just over two goals per game in league play.
Cornell lacks an offensive star, as freshman Mitch Vanderlaan leads the squad with only six conference goals. The Big Red’s top three goal-scorers in conference play have combined for 16 goals in ECAC contests, only two more than co-captain Jimmy Vesey has in conference play alone. Last year’s Hobey Baker finalist, however, did not play in the Crimson's previous game against Union due to a lower body injury.
“We’re hopeful it’s nothing too serious,” Ted Donato said. “The powers at be decided that there was a chance to maybe give a few days.”
Harvard handled its business earlier in the year in Ithaca, scoring the first three goals of the contest en route to a 6-2 win. The Crimson had six different goal scorers in the game, with all four classes represented. Sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen, who has experienced some trouble as of late manning the net, saved all but two of the 20 shots he faced in Lynah Rink.
“When he looks [comfortable and calm], it really relaxes the bench and allows our guys to play with a little more confidence,” Ted Donato said. “Obviously he’s an important part.”
This weekend will mark the first time in February in which the Crimson did not have to suit up for a Monday game earlier in the week. Harvard will look to draw upon the extra rest in this pivotal matchup.
“We’ve played a lot of emotional hockey over the past two, three weeks,” Ted Donato said. “So just getting back into a little bit of a normal routine...will get some guys healthy and strong.”
After the Ivy League title is settled, the Crimson will take on a Colgate (8-20-2, 4-12-2) team that is two points from the bottom of the conference standings. The Raiders have failed to get going on offense in conference play, as the squad is the only team in the ECAC that is averaging less than two goals per conference tilt. The point-leader for the Raiders is senior Tyson Spink, who has notched 11 points in conference play—only good for 30th in the ECAC.
The defense is not faring much better. The Raiders are conceding slightly less than three goals per game in conference play, which is the fourth-worst rate in the league.
Harvard, meanwhile, has maintained its strong power play unit from last season. The Crimson once again leads the ECAC in man-advantage conversion with a 32.7 percent conversion rate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into Levien Gymnasium a year ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team was angry and determined.
The previous game, a 57-49 defeat to Cornell that dropped the Crimson into a tie for first in the Ivy League, had been frustrating. Harvard had just 21 points in the first half and never led in the second as its eight-game winning streak ended with a whimper. A team that routinely struggled offensively made just 25 percent of its shots, its worst performance of the season. Heading into the Lions’ den, there was no more room for error.
A year later, the Crimson (10-14, 2-6 Ivy League) can only hope for the same ending: an 80-70 victory where the visitors never trailed. Harvard heads to Columbia (17-8, 6-2) on Friday with vengeance again on its mind but with the hosts—not their traveling partner—on their mind.
Columbia’s 55-54 victory over Harvard three weeks ago stands in a winter of tough losses as the one that got away from the Crimson. Back-to-back missed free throws from 40-plus percent three-point shooters opened the door for Lions senior Alex Rosenberg’s buzzer beating fadeaway, a basket that visibly shook the Crimson.
Captain Evan Cummins dropped his hands to his knees as the basket went in, with the team’s three seniors watching a parade of Lions rush a court where none of them—coach Kyle Smith included—had ever won. The celebration, a raucous one in front of the Harvard bench, was unlike anything a visitor had done in Lavietes since Cummins arrived to campus.
Junior Zena Edosomwan, who left the game with injury with Harvard safely in the lead, did not provide any bulletin board material when asked about the game this week.
“I thought about it and I’m ready,” Edosomwan said. “I want to let the play do the talking. That game was a heartbreaker and I’m excited about [the rematch].”
While Harvard’s record since the game is only a game worse than Columbia’s, who failed to capitalize on late-game opportunities versus Princeton and at Yale, it enters the contest four games behind the Lions in the league standings.
Multiple players have noted the difficulty of enduring the run of defeats; after the team’s fifth straight loss two weeks ago, senior Patrick Steeves said “I don’t think anybody expected this.”
Yet, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said that he was happy with the team’s effort last week. The Crimson notched its second Ivy League win of the season last Friday, taking down Brown, before an expected loss against league leader Yale.
“I thought we played with great energy and sense of purpose [last weekend],” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “The spirit is great and the kids are going to be ready to compete on Friday.”
The Crimson has plenty to build on coming into the weekend. Harvard averaged just 11.5 turnovers in the two losses and had a rare good day at the free throw line against Brown, making 74 percent of its attempts. Against Cornell and Columbia, who pressure the ball as intensely as any non-Princeton Ancient Eight squad, Harvard will need to take care of the ball.
Another bright spot during the weekend was Harvard’s defense. Harvard held both Brown and Yale under 45 percent shooting from the field, while limiting the two teams to a combined 19 second-chance points—getting a noticeable boost from having Edosomwan, the team’s best defensive rebounder, in the lineup.
“Even if the offense is stalling, the defense can do all those things to make sure the other team is not scoring,” Edosomwan said. “That’s how it was last year. Offensively we were not a great team but our defense kept us in a lot of games.”
The defense will be crucial as Harvard begins its six-game set of rematches. Since the arrival of the team’s current seniors, the Crimson has never lost twice to the same opponent. Against two opponents that handed Harvard difficult losses, the Crimson has an opportunity for retribution.
“I’m excited for where we can certainly be after the weekend,” Amaker said. “A lot … is on the table for our team to gather and I am still hopeful that we will have the fighting spirit to go after it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every time Columbia basketball gets moving, the world has a funny way of knocking it to its knees.
Up four with just 10 seconds to go last Saturday, Columbia borrowed a page out of its own book. Recently the most defining quality of Columbia has been its ability to, and I paraphrase Drake, drop from a hundred to zero real quick. It happened in Jadwin and Lavietes last year, against Harvard in Levien the year before, and even showed up when the Lions traveled to Kentucky.
Princeton was the last in a long line of Lions tormentors, scoring 10 points in the final 30 seconds of regulation to tie a game it would eventually win by five in overtime. Freshman Devin Cannady had the dagger—a bomb just inside the scorer’s table to tie the game with four seconds left—to cap the run, which vaulted Princeton into sole control of second place in the league with Yale coming to town.
While the focus lies on Columbia’s inability to shake its late-game tormentors, which have persisted longer than the Cha Cha Slide, the more important long-term takeaway may have been Princeton’s ascendance. By most standard efficiency metrics, this year’s Tigers team has been better than four of the last five league champions—only undefeated Yale has been better. The Bulldogs had a quiet weekend, overcoming a half of lackluster play against Dartmouth to come up with two dominant road wins. Star forward Justin Sears, who said last year beating Harvard was one of the two reasons he came to New Haven, had little to say after the win, calling Harvard just another “roadblock.”
With six games to go, Yale’s biggest test comes Friday in Jadwin. Princeton—located just 30 minutes way from where Sears grew up—is the only team to lose to Yale by less than 10 points this year. Its wings, juniors Stephen Cook, Spencer Weisz, and Henry Caruso, combine with the fearsome Amir Bell-Cannady point guard hydra give the Tigers shooters at four positions. They are the only team who can move Sears, who rarely ventures out from the paint on defense, and frontcourt teammate Brandon Sherrod around on offense.
If Yale is worried, they aren’t showing it. Fresh off his third straight win at Lavietes, a first for any opponent during Tommy Amaker’s time in Cambridge, Yale coach James Jones offered his opinion this week that the team’s last game with the Tigers wasn’t really that close at all. Jones is a brutally honest quote, but also a single-minded competitor. He’s the longest-tenured Division I basketball coach in America not to have made the big Dance, and comes off as very aware of it. He’s twice lost in a playoff, and last year’s Dartmouth loss was about as painful as a defeat can be.
Yet he should be worried about the Tigers. Cannady and Bell are two of the only players in the league who can keep up with his lightning quick point guard, sophomore Makai Mason. Yale lost its senior point guard Jack Montague this week indefinitely to personal leave, the causes of which are pure speculation, and the result is that it has just one guard on its bench—senior Khaliq Ghani—Jones trusts to play big minutes. Yale made an atypical 11 threes last time against Princeton, something it is unlikely to repeat with Montague gone.
On the other side, Caruso has to be accounted for. The junior had his worst game of the season against Columbia, making just one of 10 shots, but one of his best the last time out against Yale. He got his 26 points in a variety of ways, flummoxing the bigger Yale defenders that Jones threw at him. He ranks fifth in the league in scoring and an impressive fourth in field goal percentage, ahead of Sherrod—owner of an the NCAA-record 30 straight makes.
While Yale is the team with the longer NCAA Tournament berth drought, Caruso represents a legion of Princeton juniors who have never tasted success. He, Cook, and Weisz have toiled in the league’s middle class for the better part of three years, watching Yale and Harvard fight tooth and nail for the last two titles. The trio was unable to shake the hegemony with a single victory in their first five tries, but aced their first test at home this year, scoring 53 points on 40 shots in a clinical 21-point dismantling of the Crimson.
Friday poses a much harder midterm, but a stronger reward. Win and Princeton shifts the entire dynamic of the league, violently grabbing the driver’s seat from the team whose pro-rated start would make it arguably the best Ivy champion ever. Yale still has to go to Columbia, while Princeton gets the Lions at home. If Princeton can win, something it has done nine of the last 10 times, it will have the inside track to the ‘ship.
As for the remaining seven games:
HARVARD AT COLUMBIA
Harvard senior Patrick Steeves noted after losing to Penn that “we’re going to play all these guys again.” There’s no team, save perhaps Princeton, that Harvard would want to play more than Columbia—whose celebration after finally exercising their demons at Lavietes was outlandish. The Lions have not impressed in the last four games, but retain Maodo Lo—one of the league’s most talented players and, if his coach can get his way, a future NBA draft pick.
Pick: Columbia
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
These two schools share much in common: destitute locales, rowdy student bodies, and a commitment to playing one good weekend of basketball an Ivy League season. The journalism cognoscenti of the two schools have an interesting habit of eschewing midweek analysis of their school’s basketball team to comment on professional sports. From the depths of this week’s articles comes the hard-hitting analyses of Kevin Love (“I don’t like the guy”) and Buddy Hield (“the dude is absolutely sick”).
What’s the saying… “if it ain’t broke, it should be”?
Pick: Cornell
YALE AT PRINCETON
While the defining trait of these two teams is how much they hate Harvard, the schools have a special rivalry in their own right. Their annual football game, a sweater vest and Brooks Brothers affair if there ever was one, is the second-longest running rivalry in the country with its share of high points. The two schools have combined for 35 national titles, tops among any rivalry, and ruled the league before the rise of Harvard and Penn. Princeton’s 65-yard drop-kick to win the 1882 game remains an iconic moment in history, if not only to serve as evidence for the theory that before the forward pass came along, kickers pulled more than quarterbacks.
While it’s been icy—past Yale football players have called Princeton their biggest rival—the most profane airing of sparks happened in November, when Princeton freshman Sam Bellet, a self-proclaimed future student of “Men’s and Women’s Studies,” slammed air quotes around the world rivalry and echoed his inner Donald Trump in saying that “Princeton has had one of the most successful Halloweens in Halloween history whereas Yale can’t even decide what costume to put on.”
Howard, I do worry about these youth.
Pick: Princeton
BROWN AT PENN
This week’s journalism award goes to The Daily Pennsylvanian’s Round-Up column, a Wednesday reminder of teenage exceptionalism. From this week’s edition comes the tale of a frat brother who—absent a place to properly urinate—chugged a handle and relieved himself in trying to fill it to the brim. “Do what you gotta do” has rarely seemed like such bad advice.
Pick: Penn
BROWN AT PRINCETON
Oof.
Pick: Princeton
YALE AT PENN
Steve Donahue’s feisty club is up to fourth in the league, a clear step below the top three but a step outside of the four-way tie for last. Freshman Jackson Donahue (no relation) anchors a solid shooting team that plays exclusively at the basket and behind the three-point line. He, along with classmates Max Rotschild and Jake Silpe, represents a much-needed glimmer of hope for a campus suffering from the tight-fisted reign of a tyrant that charges $200 for lost dorm keys.
Never has taking the wrong black jacket at the Owl seemed so harmless.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
Dartmouth isn’t punchless, but unless Taylor Johnson—leading the league by making 70 percent of his twos—steps up, Miles Wright and Evan Bourdeaux aren’t going to be enough here.
Pick: Columbia 
HARVARD AT CORNELL
Cornell basketball is evocative of Ryan Reynolds: at first glance, both are pretty impressive but after a closer look, it becomes evident there’s something clearly not functioning there.
Pick: Harvard
