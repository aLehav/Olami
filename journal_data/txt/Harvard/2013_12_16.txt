After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
If the stuffiness of fat red ties, spick-and-span shoes, and effusive smiles has turned your attention from Washington, it’s time to take another look. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” which ran at the OBERON until Dec. 8, snatched America’s political history from the textbooks, brazenly reimagining the turbulent story of Old Hickory’s life.
The narrative begins with a young and boisterous Jackson (Jacob A. Brandt ’14) who, within a matter of moments, witnesses those closest to him fall victim to cholera and the cartoon boings of Native American arrows. After Jackson serves as general in the War of 1812, he declares to his wife, “Look Rachel, I love you, but I also got to kill the entire Native population.” And without further ado, Jackson makes his bid for the presidency in 1824, running against the silk-stocking Adams as the voice of the people and the Western Frontier. Jackson—the man who put the “Man” in “Manifest Destiny,” according to the show—finally assumes his position as president in 1828.
Opening with a number entitled “Populism, Yea, Yea!” the musical promptly revealed its unorthodox approach: “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” endeavored to dust off America’s younger years and revitalize them by exploring the ahistorical, ironic, and irreverent character of American youth today. Andrew Jackson’s political platform was transformed into an angsty and adrenaline-charged rock anthem with the opening of the first song. Under the musical direction of Kyra A. Atekwana '14 and Hugh P. Zabriskie '15, the exuberant songs echoed the performance’s thrilling, provocative, and rigorously insightful nature.
Dressing Jackson’s presidential opponent John Quincy Adams (Samuel B. Clark ’15) in red Converse and skinny jeans and Jackson’s presidential groupies (Madison M. Dildine ’16 and Tess V. Davison ’16) in pink cheerleading outfits, the production did away with all forms of historical and theatrical sanctimony, emphasizing the importance of bringing a modern perspective to America’s questionable past decisions. “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” confronted the Trail of Tears and other scandals tainting Jackson’s term head-on. Mercilessly laying bare American guilt, the production removed American history from its glorified narrative and bluntly placed responsibility at the feet of our country’s presidential decisions at the time.
The cast was energetic throughout their performances, springing about the OBERON’s four-sided stage and surrounding the audience, who remained pitted in the theater’s center. The blocking was physically demanding, but the cast met the challenge with assiduity and flare. Replete with sexual innuendo, political no-no’s, and ribald social commentary, the performance bore an unapologetic coarseness. The musical number entitled “Ten Little Indians,” for example, begins with, “Ten little indians standing in a line / One got executed, then there were nine.” Counting all the way down to zero, the song is offensive to a modern audience, but its crudeness successfully highlighted some of America’s shady past.
“Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” was not for the faint of heart. Rowdy and lurid, discordant and in-your-face, little could have redeemed this musical for those of more classical taste. Nevertheless, the cast’s physically demanding and impassioned performance, along with the production’s humor, unconventional music, and innovative costumes made for an exhilarating experience. Depicting a trying time in America’s history with a modern spin, “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson” was strikingly relevant and thrilling to behold.

When Pierre D. Hirschler of New York City applied early to Harvard, he didn’t give much thought to the news he would soon receive in December.
“I didn’t think about it too much, only about whether I should start working on other supplements,” said Hirschler, who attends Lycée Français de New York.
But as the clock neared 3 p.m. on Friday, he started to get nervous. Twenty minutes later, as Hirschler was sitting in his physics class, his phone began to vibrate and the entire class stopped to look at him in anticipation. After happily announcing his acceptance to the Harvard College Class of 2018, Hirschler was met with cheers and applause from his teacher and fellow students.
Hirschler was among 4,692 high school students to receive a long-awaited email when Harvard released its early admission decisions on Friday. For a select 992 students, classrooms and homes buzzed with celebration as acceptance emails offered them admission.
With letters scheduled to be sent mid-afternoon, most applicants received decision emails during the school day, forcing them to decide whether to check during class or wait until dismissal.
Hugo Yen of Fullerton, Calif., gave his phone to his teacher before noon to prevent himself from checking his email before the school day had finished. At the end of classes, Yen then had his teacher read the email to him. After what he said was an “ominous pause,” his teacher read out the first line of the letter, which said “Congratulations.” Yen was applauded by classmates and friends.
For some applicants, waiting for the email and the resultant anxiety prompted a call to the Harvard’s admissions office.
After waiting for more than half an hour past the official time results were scheduled to be released, Matthew I. Miller of Philadelphia, Penn. said he got his decision over the phone from the admissions office. He was so overwhelmed with joy that he took down the name of the person on the line and promised her flowers in the fall.
While admitted students celebrated their acceptances, some said they remained sensitive to the feelings of other classmates who did not receive such good news. When Richard M. Feder of Great Neck, N.Y. applied early to Harvard, he knew that a good friend of his had also applied and that decisions could potentially cause tension between them.
When the emails came, Feder was accepted while his good friend was deferred.
“It’s definitely awkward… but after everything is over, everybody is going to school somewhere,” he said.

The Graduate School of Design announced last Wednesday that John K. F. Irving ’83 and his sister Anne Irving Oxley have donated $10 million to the school in honor of their father John E. (Jack) Irving.
This donation will kick-off the GSD’s segment of the University-wide Capital Campaign, which aims to expand faculty research, increase financial aid funding for students, and provide interdisciplinary research scholarships.
“This gift is not about promoting a single program—this gift is about the future of the school in a world facing increasingly complex challenges," Irving, who is also a co-chair of the GSD Campaign Committee, said in a speech at the announcement party on Wednesday.
One portion of the gift will allocate funds for student fellowships and expanded research opportunities for faculty members. Funds will also be used to promote research on the relationship between landscape architecture and contemporary urbanism, one of the passions of the Irvings’ late father.
Money allocated for “immediate use” will support the John E. (Jack) Irving Dean’s Innovation Fund, an undergraduate concentration in Architectural Studies, and renovations to Gund Hall, the main GSD building, according to a press release on the school’s website.
“The John E. Irving family’s generosity toward Harvard—not just to the School of Design, but to the College and the Business School—reflects this vision of a vibrant and collaborative university community,” GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi said in the press release.
GSD students, faculty, and staff said they are excited about the expansion opportunities that this donation could catalyze.
“I think [the donation] will allow the school to have a larger presence in the Harvard community as a whole,” said GSD architecture student Kayla M. Lim, who attended the announcement party. “I think it will allow the school to grow in diversity through financial aid, which would be really great.”
Robert M. Angilly, a library assistant who has worked at the GSD for more than 30 years, said that the gift could also enhance resources for scholarship. “We may be purchasing and accessing different sorts of materials than what we have now,” he said.
Students also said that they were surprised that two people who had never attended the GSD could be so generous. Irving is the current president of Ocean Capital Investments in New Brunswick, Canada while his sister, who became acquainted with the GSD at its summer Career Discovery program, is a director at Ocean Capital Investments.
“Neither of them had gone to the Design School which was pretty interesting,” Lim said. “It’s cool that people who don’t even go here see the value of design education.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten South Asian student groups at Harvard signed a joint statement last week condemning the “recriminalization of same-sex sexual activity” in India, a development that on Sunday compelled Cambridge residents, as well as Harvard and MIT students, to stage a protest in front of the Harvard Square MBTA stop.
The statement to the Harvard community, signed by groups ranging from the Harvard South Asian Association to Harvard College Sangeet, a South Asian music association, attacked the ruling and affirmed the groups’ commitment to “serving as open and positive spaces for students of all sexual orientations and gender identities.”
The signed statement and protest were prompted after a Dec. 11 Indian Supreme Court ruling reversing a 2009 decision by a lower court that had overturned Section 377 of India’s penal code. That section, which was introduced in 1860 under British rule, currently criminalizes "sex against the order of nature.”
“It disturbs and disheartens us to know that many lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered Indian students and alumni of this University were deemed criminals by the Supreme Court of India this past Wednesday,” the groups wrote in the statement.
Anupa Murali ’16, a co-president of Harvard Mirch, a South Asian a capella group that signed the statement, said that she found the support for the statement “very encouraging.”
“I think it says something really strong about our generation,” she said, “especially considering the fact that in India this isn’t something that’s as widely supported.”
Meanwhile, as part of an international protest of the decision known as the Global Day of Rage, about 20 individuals from around Cambridge and Boston gathered in Harvard Square Sunday. Members of the group held signs with phrases like “One humanity, one struggle” and “Love is not a crime,” while chanting “Murdabad,” an Urdu word that translates to “down with” or “death to.”
Siddharth Narrain Arcot Ananth, a student at Harvard Law School who was one of the main organizers of the event, said that the protesters were trying to attract the Indian government’s attention by aiding the global protest.
“Today there are more than 30 cities across the world that are doing exactly what we are doing,” he said. “The idea is to send out a strong message to the Indian government and to the Indian Supreme Court that people across the world are upset and outraged by the judgment.”
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, the United Nations has spoken out against the decision and urged the government to reconsider.
Nishin Nathwani ’15, who was present at the event and read the student groups’ statement aloud, said that the students’ efforts illustrate “the amount of rage that there is against this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 17, 2013, at 3:05 a.m.
An apparently unfounded emailed threat of live explosives in three academic buildings and one dormitory near the center of Harvard’s campus on Monday morning prompted exam cancellations in several large courses, the descent of federal, state, and local law enforcement, and a White House briefing.
Hundreds of Harvard College students were prematurely roused from bed or abruptly interrupted from their final examinations shortly after 9 a.m., when Harvard University Police sounded alarms in four campus buildings. The evacuations of the Science Center, Emerson Hall, Sever Hall, and Thayer Hall sent scores of students into Harvard Yard and the Science Center Plaza, leaving police to search the premises. With the developing situation attracting national media attention, little happened as a nearly six hour investigation yielded no explosive contraband and authorities issued the all-clear shortly before 3 in the afternoon.
According to department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, the threat came in an emailed message to an affiliate of HUPD that was timestamped, according to Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, at 8:40 a.m.
A Harvard spokesperson who declined to be identified confirmed that the email received by the HUPD affiliate was “nearly identical” to an email received at 8:45 a.m. by Crimson President Robert S. Samuels ’14. Under the subject line “bombs placed around campus,” the email to Samuels read, “bombs placed in: science center [and] sever hall [and] emerson hall [and] thayer hall. 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.”
After the HUPD affiliate read the emailed threat, the department immediately dispatched officers because the email specifically named its targets, according to the Harvard spokesperson. Simultaneously with the dispatch, the spokesperson said, HUPD drafted a MessageMe alert to the Harvard community, the first of more than 10 emails that College students would receive from Harvard officials throughout the day. Repeatedly in those messages, administrators stressed that they were acting out of an “abundance of caution” in an effort to keep the campus community safe.
By the time that first MessageMe alert was sent at 9:02 a.m., HUPD officers had already started evacuating the targeted buildings. Another alert, at 9:13 a.m., reported that HUPD and Cambridge Police were on the scene and investigating. By noon, state and federal authorities had arrived on the scene, and President Obama had been briefed on the situation, according to a White House spokesperson.
Not long after the building evacuations, authorities closed Harvard Yard. Students evacuated from the Science Center who had initially thought the disturbance was nothing more than an ill-timed fire drill were directed to an Annenberg Hall that quickly overflowed from the combination of the usual breakfast rush and those displaced from exam rooms and bedrooms.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris soon joined the students in Annenberg, where he would later be joined by University President Drew G. Faust and interim College Dean Donald H. Pfister. After discussing the situation with a number of teaching staff, Harris climbed on a table and announced that all of the exams scheduled that morning in the three affected classroom buildings had been cancelled. During his impromptu speech, Harris did not settle definitively the question of whether cancelled exams would need to be made up.
Throughout the morning, students with exams scheduled for the day received emails from teaching fellows and professors, many of whom expressed uncertainty about how their courses would be graded, and if students would be required to make up exams. With three major academic buildings still shuttered, students slated to sit for finals at 2 p.m. were cast into an uncomfortable holding pattern. Just after 12 p.m., the University notified parents of undergraduates of the ongoing situation.
With the search turning up no evidence of explosives, life in the Yard began to return to normalcy as the day progressed. The Yard reopened to Yard residents before 11 a.m. And, at 12:40 p.m., Securitas guards stood by Johnston, Widener, Lamont, and the Science Center gates, allowing Harvard ID holders into the Yard. Shortly before noon, several dozen students could be found studying in Lamont Cafe, as well as in Lamont’s reading rooms. At least three others had fallen asleep, some at tables, others on couches.
Early in the afternoon, HUPD sent out alerts announcing that Emerson and Thayer, and then Sever and Harvard Yard, were safe for return, but officers continued to search the Science Center, forcing the cancellation of afternoon exams set to be held there. In an email to undergraduates just minutes before 2 p.m. exams were scheduled to start, Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison wrote that any students who felt unprepared to take their still-scheduled afternoon exams could be excused from the sitting. 
Those who opted to forgo uncancelled afternoon exams, Ellison wrote, could choose to be graded on coursework to date, excluding the final, or to be evaluated on a pass/fail basis without penalty. In an email later in the afternoon, Ellison reiterated that the rest of the week’s exams remained scheduled.
Authorities finally cleared the Science Center at 2:44 p.m., effectively declaring an end to the campus scare. As of press time, Catalano would not comment on whether the investigation had turned up any suspects.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: December 16, 2013, at 2:02 p.m.
With bomb threats in four buildings looming and affected morning exams cancelled, undergraduates evacuated from the Science Center and other buildings in Harvard Yard Monday morning congregated in common spaces throughout campus, awaiting news from law enforcement officials and administrators.
Thayer Hall resident Zachary M. Dinan ’17 was awoken by a blaring fire alarm around 9 a.m. Expecting to "be back in his bed in five minutes," Dinan did not even think to put socks on before leaving Thayer, which, along with the Science Center, Emerson Hall, and Sever Hall, was evacuated early in the morning following unconfirmed reports of explosives.
When he went downstairs and asked the police officer if there was an actual fire, the officer told him that “it was going to be a while.”
“He said to go to Annenberg and wait it out,” said Dinan.
Thayer was cleared later in the afternoon.
A. Viktor Wrobel ’17 was sitting in the Science Center awaiting the start of his Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” exam around 9 a.m. when the fire alarm went off and students were evacuated from the building.
“The policeman outside said, ‘Go find someplace warm, because you're not getting in anytime soon,’” Wrobel said
Wrobel added that he was “not too upset” because he appreciates the additional time to study, although he was “a little unsettled.”
“It would be nice to get some sort of notification about rescheduling or whether we can go back in or exactly what's going on," said Wrobel.
Former Undergraduate Council Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 sent an email several top College administrators, including Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, and Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, asking for more information about exams and safe areas surrounding evacuated buildings with an email at 9:34 a.m.
“I'm one of the hundreds of students that have been evacuated from Thayer, Sever, Science Center, Emerson due to explosive threats—students appreciate the notifications informing us what's going on but want more specific instructions from the MessageMe and emails instructing what we should do, given the news,” wrote Zhu, who was scheduled to take an exam for Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” in the Science Center at 9 a.m. She added in the email, which was also sent over the UC general list, that some students subscribed to MessageMe, Harvard’s emergency alert service, had not received text alerts.
In an interview with The Crimson Monday afternoon, Zhu said that she thought administrators had improved the University’s emergency communication system since the Boston Marathon bombings and manhunt in April, though she added that there is always room for improvement. She said she had been in contact with administrators from the Office of Student Life since sending the email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: December 16, 2013, at 11:52 p.m.
Shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, the roughly one third of students in the introductory chemistry and biology course Life Sciences 1a who were sitting for their final exam in Emerson Hall were greeted by the shrill ringing of a fire alarm heralding a campus bomb scare.
 
As those students were evacuated, the remaining two thirds of the class, divided between Geological Lecture Hall and Yenching Auditorium, began taking their exams, blissfully unaware of the disruption in and around Harvard Yard until they were notified of the threats by course staff approximately midway through their exams.
 
After unconfirmed bomb threats prompted law enforcement to evacuate four campus buildings Monday morning, several of the morning and afternoon’s final exams—including the Emerson Hall sitting of LS1a—were cancelled and rescheduled as course staff and administrators adjusted to the day’s events.
 
Courses with final exams scheduled for 9 a.m. Monday in the three affected classroom buildings—the Science Center and Emerson and Sever Halls—were cancelled, with grading and rescheduling options varying for each course.
 
Students in some courses with morning exams, including Government 1510: "American Constitutional Law” and Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology,” had the option of taking the exam at a rescheduled time this week or at the start of next semester, or not taking the exam at all and accepting their current grade. For its part, LS1a required students in the evacuated Emerson Hall exam sitting to make up their missed exams Monday evening or in early spring.
 
Most exams scheduled for 2 p.m. proceeded as scheduled—with several exceptions. Three afternoon exams scheduled to be held in the Science Center were cancelled, and two mathematics exams were relocated. And students who felt unprepared to take their still-scheduled afternoon exams were excused from the sitting and given the choice of accepting their current grade without the final exam or changing their course grading status to pass/fail with no penalty.
 
Some students already stressed by exams were unsettled by Monday’s events and its implications for their academics. The news about the bomb scare “rattled a lot of people,” said Philip J. Abboud ’17, a student in LS1a who took the exam in the Geological Lecture Hall.
 
Students who completed the LS1a test expressed mixed views on the decision to postpone the exam for some students to the spring semester, noting that while more time to study might be an advantage, students would also be more likely to forget course material.
 
Faculty and staff teaching courses affected by the bomb scare also wrestled with decisions about how to proceed given the circumstances.
 
After the Science Center was evacuated, Gregory Tucci, a senior lecturer on chemistry and chemical biology who co-teaches LPSA,  met in Annenberg with the course’s teaching staff, and spoke with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, to discuss what to do about the cancelled exam. Tucci said he knew that some students were leaving campus, and so he wanted to make sure that they had two opportunities to make up the exam. He also wanted to give them an option not to take the exam at all.
 
“We did not want this experience to hurt their grade[s] in any way,” Tucci said in a phone interview Monday evening. “It was a tough day,” he added.
 
Just before noon on Monday, Harvard Law School professor Richard H. Fallon sent an email to his students in Government 1510 informing them about their options to make up or forgo their cancelled exam.
 
“I am terribly sorry about this morning's bomb scare,” Fallon wrote in his email to students. “I very much hope that it was not too traumatic for any of you in its effects.”
 
Not all courses will be offering make-up sessions for affected Monday morning exams, however. After students were evacuated from Emerson, the final exam for intermediate language course Greek Ac was immediately relocated to Boylston Hall, where students completed the test in spite of the disruption. And students enrolled in Government 1368: “The Politics of American Education” must now complete a take-home exam in its place, to be turned in by Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As law enforcement officials secured Harvard Yard and searched several Harvard buildings for reported explosives, activity in Harvard Square and the surrounding area continued as usual Monday, mostly uninterrupted by events unfolding inside the University gates.
While at least one local school took extra safety precautions following an early-morning bomb threat to four Harvard buildings, owners and managers of Square businesses said that they did not alter their operations and that sales numbers were largely unaffected by Monday’s events. And although some employees were perturbed by reports of the bomb threat, many also said that their knowledge of the situation was limited and they had not closely been following the developing story.
“I’m not as informed as I should be, but I understand that there was some fake, potential bomb,” said Chris Kotelly, owner of the Crimson Corner, adding that his newsstand was enjoying as much business as is typical for a Monday.
Managers at CVS and Pinocchio's Pizza & Subs also said that the threat did not appear to impact sales and expressed little concern with the events of the day.
“Several people have said that they think that it’s a Harvard student that just didn’t feel like taking an exam today, so they called in the threats,” Noch’s manager Adam DiCenso said. “I don’t know if that’s true, but it’s kind of funny.”
At Pinkberry, a shift leader on duty said that the store was more concerned about business than the threat to the security of the area.
“We don’t really look at what’s going on as much, because we’re busy about our store,” shift leader Tausha Chareunchit said. “Because it’s a franchise, we worry more about our store than the location.”
Just a block away at J.P. Licks, however, one employee expressed distress and fear for her own safety. 
“I was really traumatized,” Elisa M. Sanchez said, adding that, upon hearing the news, she was afraid to go to work.
While businesses carried on with the day as usual, at least one local school reacted substantively to the bomb threat. Students at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which is several blocks from the Yard, were required to stay indoors during lunch and recess, although the school was not fully locked down, a school employee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When head coach Tim Murphy announced his departure for Penn State, the men’s swimming and diving team was left with a big void. After 15 years at Harvard, Murphy had left a lasting mark on the program, registering a 122-11 dual meet record and seven undefeated dual meet seasons during his tenure.
But even with the absence of Murphy, the Crimson is off to a perfect 3-0 start to its 2013-14 campaign, all with a familiar face at the helm of the program. A former assistant coach, Kevin Tyrrell now serves as The Ulen-Brooks Endowed Coach for Harvard Men’s Swimming and Diving.
Tyrell is no stranger to Cambridge, having first stepped on the scene in 2000 as a volunteer coach. At the time, Tyrell was coaching at a local high school as well as at YMCA swimming in Boston.
“They overlapped quite a bit,” Tyrrell said. “I did both the high school coaching job, the YMCA coaching job, and the volunteer coaching job here all at the same period of time. All three of them taught me different things about swimming.”
In 1995, Bishop Fenwick High School in Peabody, Mass. gave Tyrrell his first coaching opportunity. Tyrrell coached the team for five years, gaining knowledge that would carry him through the rest of his career.
“The high school team was great because I learned to figure out how you can put together a meet lineup to beat another team,” Tyrrell said. “Its not always about the person whose best at certain events, but how you matchup with other programs, so I’ve used that skill quite a bit here.”
The position at Bishop Fenwick then gave way to another pivotal opportunity in Tyrrell's career, as he became the head coach of the North Shore Sharks at the YMCA. Tyrrell’s team was the largest YMCA swim team in the country. He coached 32 All-Americans and posted a 62-6 dual meet record during his tenure there.
“The YMCA job was great because it was a team of 500 swimmers and 42 coaches,” Tyrrell said. “From a managerial and budgetary standpoint, learning how to work with large groups of athletes was very valuable to me.”
Midway through his time at the YMCA, Tyrrell found himself in Cambridge, volunteering as a coach for the Crimson. Tyrrell played a role in helping Harvard capture two Ivy League titles in his first four seasons with the squad.
“Volunteering here, I got to know Coach Murphy,” Tyrrell said. “I got to know how things work from both an administrative and a coaching standpoint.”
But in 2005, Tyrrell was asked to coach his most competitive program to date, the U.S. Virgin Islands National Team. Born in Kingshil, Tyrrell returned to the Virgin Islands and coached the team for four years, taking them to the FINA World Championships in Rome, the World University Games in Bangkok, and the Pan American Games in Brazil.
“The greatest thing about that Virgin Islands program is that because they are a territory of the U.S. and not officially a state, they have their own Olympic committee,” Tyrrell said. “That means that we have the ability, if swimmers are fast enough, to go events like the Olympics, Pan-American Games, and World Championships. That, from a coaching standpoint, is great because you can really focus kids in on that, giving them a great opportunity to grow as a person.”
In 2008, Tyrell did exactly that, traveling to Beijing for the Olympic Games. As a coach, Tyrrell walked in the Opening Ceremonies and stood alongside greats such as Michael Phelps on the pool deck.
“I really learned how to become a better coach through all those meets down there at the Olympics,” Tyrrell said. “Its one thing to think about [coaching there], but if you actually get the shot to do it and practice and coach athletes at that level both mentally and physically, that’s an experience you really can’t replace with anything.”
After spending four years in the Virgin Islands, Tyrrell returned back to Boston where it all started. In 2009, Murphy hired Tyrrell, who took the reigns as head of recruiting for the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team.
Tyrrell’s last 14 years coaching gave him plenty of recruiting knowledge, but he also drew from his own experience as a recruited collegiate swimmer. In 1988, Tyrrell joined the Lafayette College swim team, where he led his team to a second place finish in the ECAC and was a two-time captain.
“I went in freshman year as one of their top swimmers, and the coach there did a really good job recruiting,” Tyrrell said. “By the time I left, I was one of the guys who was not counted on to score points all the time.”
At Harvard, Tyrrell approached each recruit with the same thought process he had when deciding on where to attend school himself: finding the right fit between athletics and academics.
“I make sure there is a really good fit between what they are looking for academically and athletically,” Tyrrell said. “On the academic side, guys have to want to come here and be challenged in the classroom. That was my process, and I thought I could be really challenged at Lafayette, as I was.”
One of Tyrrell’s recruits was Oliver Lee, who is now a co-captain of the team and holds the Harvard record in the 50 meter free. The senior is also a member of four school record-holding relay teams.
“I spoke with him the summer before senior year of high school,” Lee said. “He was definitely a big factor in my coming to Harvard. He is a great recruiter; it’s one of his strengths, and he has gotten us faster and faster guys every year.”
Tyrrell’s efforts helped the program bring in three Top-20 classes over the past three years. Since 2009, Tyrrell’s recruits have helped Harvard set 12 school records, win eight Ivy League championships, and go 31-4 in dual meets.
When Tyrrell was promoted to head coach this summer, he finally got the opportunity to coach those very swimmers he had brought to Cambridge.
“We were happy that he was going to be our head coach because he knew the program and all the guys on the team, so it wasn’t a drastic shift in coaching staff,” Lee said. “There was a seamless transition."
Though Tyrrell was more than a familiar face around the locker room, he has changed up the coaching style. Tyrrell has altered the way practice is run, having his team swim fewer miles at a faster pace and picking up the overall tempo of the racers.
“He has a different take on the sport,” Lee said. “He focuses on the motional part and the fundamental technicalities that make swimmers fast. He has a very planned out program that has been working very well so far.  There is a lot more quality work than quantity work. “
Despite his success, Tyrrell’s future with the program still remains somewhat uncertain with just a one-year contract. But that hasn’t deterred Tyrell at all. With the Crimson undefeated in dual meets this season, Tyrrell isn’t even thing about his future. Instead, the coach is only thinking about future of his swimmers, making sure it’s a bright one both in the pool and the classroom. Tyrrell says he has the same mindset for coaching whether he is here for another month, year, or decade.
“I have to push these guys and try to develop them and make them better human beings, so they can go on and do awesome things in there lives,” Tyrrell said. “I don’t feel any added pressure. I come in, and I work hard and try to do the best job that I can.”

When Tony Soprano sent his daughter to Columbia University in the famous TV show "The Sopranos", he recoiled from an additional $50,000 "donation" that the dean requested. Even the great mob boss of New Jersey considered Ivy League costs a shakedown—and that episode aired in 2001.
Since then, tuitions have skyrocketed, nearly doubling the cost of attending highly selective private schools over the span of 13 years. Parents could expect to pay $22,054 for a Harvard tuition in 2000. Now that number is $37,576. Over the same period, Stanford, Princeton, Yale, and MIT saw similarly meteoric increases. This growth seems an uniquely American phenomenon (read Oxford’s prices and weep).
These prices make you yearn for the good old days of 1920 when attending the University of Pennsylvania cost just $700 (a mere $8,500 in 2013 dollars).
The cost of attending college could soon become a crisis in a country where high-paying jobs for those without university degrees are scarce. The college wage premium—the ratio of hourly earnings for bachelor’s degrees holders to those for workers with some college education—has been steadily increasing since the 70’s, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.
But with higher stakes come higher debts. The amount of debt held in student loans quadrupled from 2003 to 2012, and now stands at more than one trillion dollars, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, said in an interview with National Public Radio. This is a sum that young adults cannot escape, not even through bankruptcy.
And the pace appears to be accelerating as public universities see their budgets slashed from states whose funds are being diverted to unstable pension and Medicare funds.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which keeps track of inflation, has shown the cost of college dramatically outpace base inflation, growing nearly 140 percent faster than the consumer price index for urban consumers. College costs have grown faster than even medical care.
That’s not to say that there could not be justifiable reasons for the tuition hikes. Running world-class universities is a pricey business and admissions offices are likely to cite robust financial aid programs and improved facilities as counterbalances to the inexorable climb of the sticker cost of attending college.
