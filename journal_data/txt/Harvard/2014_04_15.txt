How long can high literature continue to fetishize the impenetrable? James Joyce has been dead for over 70 years, Ezra Pound for over 40. The artistic merits of inscrutability, always questionable, seem by the modern day to have been largely exhausted. The aesthetic seems now to be used primarily as a mask of sophistication for artists who cannot maintain a coherent narrative or who do not have anything worthwhile to say—and it has been that way for some time, as indicated by Adam Morris’s translation of Brazilian writer Hilda Hilst’s 1986 work “With My Dog Eyes.”
 Hilst, inheritor of an old Brazilian coffee fortune, resided and wrote in her “Casa do Sol,” a retreat built on her family’s farm and a refuge for a tribe of literary eccentrics and an enormous packs of dogs. Hilst’s reception in Brazil, discussed in Morris’s introduction, has been mixed. On the one hand, she received all major Brazilian literary awards during her lifetime; on the other hand, her work was condemned as pornography and has largely remained untranslated from its original Portuguese for decades.
 In retrospect, the decision to protect foreign markets from the hackneyed, incoherent ramblings on display in “With My Dog Eyes” looks more admirable. The Brazilian literary establishment appears to have been had. The novella (at 62 pages, it is difficult to categorize), which is ostensibly about the transcendent revelation and mental breakdown of the mathematician Amós Kéres, is not only formless and confused but also trite. The connections between mathematics, poetry, and the transcendent have been thoroughly explored, and while this fact does not preclude fresh work on the theme, none is here presented that has not already been consummately overused. Hilst describes her protagonist at work: “At night returning to his studies, searching, searching principally for order, mind and heart integrated once more in those magnificent suns of ice formulas expansions expressions, Amós would drift sublimely over some pages, and wasn’t it in a sudden burst that everything was no longer?” The image is so worn and the presentation so overwrought and so familiar that nothing edifying is to be gained from it. The same condemnation applies to her description of Amós’s ambitions. “Hopes: Amós Kéres, mathematician, proved today by scientific methods his conception of the univocal universe.” What is a univocal universe? When did pure mathematics ever prove anything by scientific methods? Why should the reader care?
 Similarly, Hilst’s frequent reliance on her shallow readings of Neoplatonism and Gnosticism is wearying. At one point, one of Amós’s friends declares, “And then I understood that only polyhedrons exist.” Amós thinks unclearly as he rampages through town during his breakdown: “Cursing and cruel, stained in inks, those dark-dusks of not knowing how to say it, I attempt an amputee’s step forward, a blind knowledge of light, an armless embrace of you, Knowledge.”  The Gnostic texts especially are rich mines of images and ideas; however, to put the generic, unspecific notional end of Gnosticism directly into the mouth of a character is amateurish at best. If originality is not Hilst’s strong suit, it cannot be said that she makes up the difference in subtlety.
 The prize judges of Brazil’s literary establishment were fooled by Hilst’s act; Morris, her translator, is completely taken in. His introduction is not literary criticism, or even biography, but rather hagiography: in addition to being a third as long as the text itself, it contains such hackneyed gems as “Hilst chafed at the constraints of bourgeois values” and, on her marriage, the absurdly diplomatic statement “The couple had also discovered that cohabitation was incompatible with Hilst’s rigorous devotion to her craft.” Morris seems to be unable to speak a word against Hilst in spite of the fact that he freely catalogues her abuse of her lovers, her alienation of friends, and her eventual retreat into angry, crazed isolation. Even great work can come from unpleasant people; the case of Evelyn Waugh comes to mind. Morris, however, adopts the childish critical attitude that, because he thinks that Hilst is a great writer, all her personal dislikability is to be lionized rather than excused. This sort of pandering on behalf of a good writer would be absurd; for a mediocre author playing at inscrutable greatness, it is unforgivable.
 In sum, there is little to recommend “With My Dog-Eyes.” This is not “The Waste Land.”  This is not “Ulysses.” This is not “Cathay.” This is a middle-schooler’s short story ginned up with sex and incoherent poetry. Maybe opaque modernism is not dead, but this work does not give support to those who argue this. “With My Dog-Eyes” is not a lost masterpiece; it is a call to action, to reform a critical atmosphere in which failure to communicate is raised to the acme of aesthetic virtue.

 Getting lost within the pages of a book can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but what happens when obsession goes too far? In his second novel, Boston writer Jaime Clarke explores the darker side of literary admiration. The result is “Vernon Downs,” a stunning and unsettling foray into a glamorous world of celebrity writers, artistic loneliness, and individual desperation. The novel itself is unassuming enough: a meek paperback totaling 165 pages, easily lost among a bookshelf of grander volumes. However, the old adage about judgment and covers should be taken seriously here—this little book has a lot to say.
 Clarke immediately introduces the source of conflict, and from here the novel unfolds with a calm strength that easily propels the read. He introduces Charlie, a middle-aged creative writing major with a past of chronic abandonment and an unfortunate crush. He’s infatuated with international student Olivia, but she only wants a summer fling with an American; predictably, Charlie finds himself deserted, cripplingly heartbroken, and unsure of his next move. In a last-ditch attempt to gain experience worthy of Olivia’s attention, he vows to link himself to her favorite celebrity writer, Vernon Downs. What follows is a steady descent into emulation and instability that both is wild and feels strangely natural.
 Clarke deftly constructs his characters from the ground up, using succinct and poignant descriptions that give deep insight into personal motivations and limitations without bogging down the text with obvious, forced characteristics. In the center of this finely woven fabric of personalities is Charlie. The orphaned loner has clearly established emotional trauma that has the potential to limit his actions. However, his desperation is coupled with a clever cynicism that saves him from helplessness as the work develops. He craves attention and stumbles to rescue himself from an endless cycle of dead-end relationships that require little emotional skill but a lot of cunning. While reading “Pride and Prejudice” in class, Charlie is forced to stop, “as the phrase, ‘It is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life’ upset him so much that he couldn’t continue.” Clark’s scattered glimpses into his psyche reveal a battered soul innocently sensitive to his surroundings.
 As Clarke filters the world through Charlie’s eyes, the character’s irrationality becomes unexpectedly relatable. Charlie’s emotional reactions are extreme, but at their essence is the universal desire to fix things, to patch relationships and avoid confrontation, to crave acceptance and fear abandonment. Charlie loses himself in these motivations, leading to an immersion in literature that has him eventually forcing himself into the world of writing and publishing through his connection with author Vernon Downs. Driven by the link he sees between this celebrity and Olivia, Charlie becomes increasingly bound to Downs’s identity until his preoccupation threatens to suffocate him. Fan obsession has been a topic of creative expression many times before; however, in the capable hands of Clarke, the dynamic between Charlie and Downs expands to a commentary on literary exaltation itself. Downs becomes the manipulator, and Charlie becomes the victim; underneath the monopoly of celebrity gossip and adoration surrounding Downs, the famous author’s shiny world dims with scrutiny. Clarke’s carefully constructed dynamic begs reconsideration of what it truly means to become a successful writer.
 In light of the book’s unstable, emotionally charged content, the storyline
 could feasibly become smothered by the heavy tone. Thankfully, with “Vernon Downs” this is never the case. Clark’s storytelling is subtle but strong—the prose paints an effective emotional landscape following the main character’s inner ramblings: “Charlie migrated unencumbered toward the subway, disguised in the crowd as somebody racing toward something…. He refused to acknowledge the emotional attrition invested in every next adventure, every new face, every new terrain.” Clarke manages to gracefully balance artistic imagery with meaning, maintaining a novel that is as readable as it is evocative.
 Indeed, at times it seems like Clarke could elaborate more; his substance-rich prose becomes too concentrated with meaning in a few instances, creating indirect leaps in understanding. However, any frustration at the momentary loss of comprehension abates as Clarke’s steppingstones finally reveal themselves, leading to textual discoveries that feel more satisfying than they would be if the author spoon-fed context. “Vernon Downs” avoids the pitfalls of predictability and monotony beautifully, embodying an emotional journey through obsession and imitation that is at once encouraging and disturbing, heartening and disconcerting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


“Harvard hasn’t always been interested in preservation.” Midday shadows darken the Franklin Delano Roosevelt suite in the Westmorly Court building of Adams House. I am sitting with Michael D. Weishan ’86, an acclaimed landscape architect and designer who oversaw the $300,000 restoration of Roosevelt’s rooms. Everything, with the exception of my iPhone on the table, is as it was in 1904, when Roosevelt graduated from Harvard. Weishan and his team have painstakingly recreated the original opulence of the room, and the result is staggering. The setup isn’t larger than that of other rooms in Westmorly, but the level of artistic care and detail, from the meticulously carved linen-fold wooden doors to the sleek Morris chairs, seems impossibly antiquated to my contemporary and begrudgingly utilitarian architectural eye.
After I take in the surroundings, Weishan asks me about my angle for the story. I stumble through something about gardens at Harvard and then improvise about the increasing significance of landscape preservation here. He perks up at this last point. “It sounds like that’s where the story is,” he says excitedly. He’s right. Over the next hour we explore the spotty history of Harvard’s relationship with preservation. I leave convinced that there’s a phenomenon afoot far larger than the recreation of a president’s college rooms: Harvard is experiencing a landscaping renaissance. New ideologies about aesthetics and homage and an unprecedented appreciation of the past have emerged in tandem with modern technological methods to effectively recreate the grandiosity of the University’s historic look.
THE JOURNEY TOWARDS PRESERVATION
Weishan is extremely prolific. In addition to his work on Adams, he has hosted “Victory Gardens,” a weekly gardening show on PBS, and heads his own landscape and design firm. To top it off, he boasts a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of the architectural and landscaping history of Harvard and can jump cogently and instantaneously between centuries, Yards, and trends. It is clear that he not only is informed about Harvard’s relationship with preservation but also cares immensely about its significance and the difficulties attendant on it.
Weishan primarily uses buildings to point to the morphing focus towards preservation, but he insists that the trajectory of landscape preservation evolved in tandem. According to Weishan, the initial construction of these buildings was followed by “a period of sentimentality for colonial styles in the early 1900s,” and then “a period of modernism where everything old was suspect.” Now, we are in the midst of “a period of appreciation, and some would say reverence, for these historic buildings.”
Weishan is openly critical of the mid-century modernist period. During that time, the prevalence of the brutalist architectural style (think Mather House) contributed to the replacement of various classical landmarks by concrete behemoths and asphalt pathways. “The University actually thought, until fairly recently, that new was also better,” Weishan says. “We would routinely bulldoze buildings and put new ones up—Holyoke Center is a perfect example of that. These were buildings that were considered revolutionary at the time, but now are by and large considered dysfunctional.”
Yet the point of Weishan’s reflections is not solely to show that Harvard has turned a corner or that the present preservationist movement is more novel than it might appear. It also points to the fickle and unpredictable nature of artistic and architectural appreciation. “All this criticism I’ve been giving to the Holyoke Center and William James Hall…. Who knows? In 50 years they may be considered revolutionary,” he says. “I highly doubt it, though.” He becomes more serious and notes that there was a time in the mid-1950s when President Nathan Marsh Pusey publically criticized Memorial Hall and anything with tinges of gaudy Victorian influence.
The imagined objectivity of the present makes the art of preservation all the more challenging. What if we save the wrong things? What if our re-landscaping is just tacky nostalgia? While these questions are impossible to answer in the present, the preservationist movement, particularly in the landscaping world, is somehow finding a tight-rope thin balance in its approach.
THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM
A brief walk from Forest Hills, the final stop on the Orange Line, finds me in an entirely unfamiliar clime: Jamaica Plain. The neighborhood is a bizarre zoning amalgam—smokestacks intermingle with freshly-painted Arts and Crafts homes and ugly 1960s high-rise apartment buildings. One of the first suburbs spurred on by the advent of public transportation in the country, Jamaica Plain was a vibrant immigrant community throughout the first half of the 20th century. However, the plight of redlining, or economically and racially motivated mortgage and insurance restrictions brought a period of economic decline, which gentrification has reversed over the last 20 years. Nestled in the center of the neighborhood is the Arnold Arboretum. Owned and operated by Harvard and partially maintained by the City of Boston, the 281-acre arboretum has been a cultural touchstone in the constantly shifting neighborhood for over 140 years.
I meet Jon Hetman, the communications and stewardship officer at the Arboretum, at his office in the red-brick Victorian Hunnewell Visitor Center. Hetman has held the post for 14 years and, like Weishan, appears to be an informational master of his domain. He tosses out dates and plant species with appealing panache. He tells me that the Arboretum, originally bequeathed to Harvard in the early 1870s, is a link in the famed Emerald Necklace, an interconnected series of Boston green spaces designed by landscape architect and co-designer of Central Park Frederick Law Olmsted. Hetman applauds how vigilant the Arboretum staff has been in maintaining Olmsted and inaugural director Charles Sprague Sargent’s initial vision for the space: “We’ve always taken it as a point of pride that we are one of the best-preserved of Olmsted’s landscapes,” Hetman says. He describes Olmsted and Sargent’s decision to organize the plants by their chronological place on the evolutionary timeline. The two men, still less than 20 years removed from “On the Origin of Species,” wanted to have people walk through the Arborway Gate and get a view of how plants developed using the Arboretum’s  own collection.
The Arboretum was faced with a difficult choice when modern horticulture began to disprove Olmsted and Sargent’s understanding of the progression of plant evolution. “The conifers, which are very far into the Arboretum and which I guess they thought were of the more advanced order, are actually the more ancient plants,” Hetman explains. As a result of these discoveries, the Arboretum staff was faced with the question of whether to alter Olmsted’s evolutionarily incorrect aesthetic. “Once you set this landscape up, though, it isn’t easy to move things around. We’ve stuck to that original plan.” Their valuing of Olmsted’s aesthetic and the logistical grace of his set-up over his theory has, in Hetman’s eyes, been integral to the continued beauty and flow of the space.
The staff of the Arboretum has also worked to honor Olmsted’s vision of the space as an educational and cutting-edge locale. The Arboretum utilizes the most advanced watering and soil enhancement techniques, visibly tags and tracks 15,000 plants, and recently released an iPhone app that allows visitors to do their own research.
“Visitors and our staff once just had to make their best guess about plotting where plants were,” Hetman says. “All of our plants are now ‘globally located.’ On our web app, you can now track every plant that we have here instantly. This is where things are going…. It’s improving how we do our jobs and allows visitors to find our plants.” Geese waddle alongside the Arboretum’s ponds as I download the web app and find my way to a few of the highlighted plants of the month. By using modern science to honor his vision of the garden as a place for education and engagement with the specimens, the Arnold Arboretum has found a way to preserve its scientific viability without undermining Olmsted’s original aesthetic.
THE SPOILS OF THE SOIL
The theme of technology-as-preservation continues to come up in my interviews and encounters with landscape restoration. I stand outside of Johnston Gate and watch as two property maintenance workers from Harvard Campus Services organize the shovels, spades, and levelers that rest against the brick wall next to the gate. I’m meeting Eric T. Fleisher, an environmental consultant who developed Harvard’s organic soil system. Before long, Fleisher drives up in a red Campus Services pick-up, white bags of soil bouncing in the bed of the truck. Dressed in a beige blazer, Fleisher’s style couldn’t be more different from that of his team. Yet he is down in the soil with them, mixing in his product while the group works on steadying the baby oak they have just dropped into place. Fleisher emerges from the pit as one of the workers breaks open the bags of soil, fires up a parked backhoe loader, and begins moving the soil from the truck and into the pit.
While a Loeb Fellow at the Graduate School of Design in 2007, Fleisher tested out his creation of a new a sustainable kind of soil that creates its own nitrogen in a one-acre parcel nearby Holden Chapel. The experiment was a success—landscapes all over campus soon adopted Fleisher’s soil. When new restorations happen, he watches over their implementation into the plots. “I’m up here one or two days a month and work on microbiology in terms of the soil’s health,” he says. “When we do a restoration, it’s important that we get the right soil in.” Fleisher is especially thrilled that the soil is entirely non-toxic and opens up the Yard and other green spaces on campus without any chemical concerns to students and visitors. “There’s less need for water or fertilizer…. We’re creating a closed-loop, high quality compost that goes into building these soils and spaces.” Thus, restoration can be progressive, as opposed to merely responsive. By injecting safe and sustainable practices into aesthetic reimagining, designers and scientists can both make a positive difference on their environments.
HELP  FROM  CHICAGO
The Johnston Gate restoration, like the arboretum’s scientific development, has theory at its core. Blair Kamin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic for The Chicago Tribune, talks to me on the phone from his office early in the morning. A
fixture at the Tribune since 1992, he led a Wintersession course as a Nieman Fellow last year on the 26 gates of Harvard Yard. Kamin was so interested in the gates that he edited and co-authored a collaborative book with his students and another teacher on their architectural history. Kamin’s presented his exploration during a talk at the Harvard Club of Chicago and sparked an unexpected $5,000 donation to fix Johnston Gate, which is named after native Chicagoan real estate entrepreneur Samuel Johnston, Class of 1855. “We looked at the gates, we looked at the design aesthetically, and we looked at the landscapes surrounding them, some of which are in less than ideal shape,” Kamin says. Johnston Gate was one of those that had fallen into a state of disrepair. The two trees that graced the entry until last week have been uprooted and replaced with new red oaks. Liriope, a purplish plant, will grace Fleisher’s soil closer to the ground. Kamin, audibly excited about the tree replacement and panel restoration, explains why the new replacement trees are fitting, given the initial intent of Johnston Gate. “The Gate is an entrance to the Yard, but it is also an extension of the Yard,”
 
 “It doesn’t just create a border between the street and Harvard, but those little panels of greenery were meant to extend the Yard outward to the edge of the city, where town and gown meet.” Before the restoration, the trees by the gate were not displayed in a way that did justice to original intent of the landscape. “The hackberry trees were in these awful-looking dirt patches,” explains Kamin. “There was no sense of the Yard extending past the Gate.”
 
 With Kamin and Fleisher providing both theory and scientific savoir faire, the Johnston Gate restoration appears poised to beautify and repurpose the panels so they reflect their former glory. 
 
VAN WITH A PLAN
 
Another giant in the re-landscaping game has also been instrumental in the restoration of Harvard Yard. “Michael has worked really hard to preserve the trees, the layout, and the abilities of the people to use the Yard. It takes a lot of abuse…. It requires a huge amount of upkeep,” says Weishan. Weishan is not speaking in the third-person—he is referring to landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh. Every interviewee mentions Van Valkenburgh in some way, particularly because he designed the new Johnston Gate panels pro bono as part of his ongoing repair and restoration of Harvard Yard. Picked in 1993 to helm the re-landscaping effort of the Yard, Van Valkenburgh managed to recapture a fading grandiosity while bringing a grove of new trees into the landscape.
 
 


Laura Solano, a principal architect at Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates who has observed the transformation of the Yard under Van Valkenburgh, distilled the firm’s views on re-landscaping in a way that concisely captured the interplay between modern technology and restoration efforts that honor the past. “One of the most critical beginnings was removing all of the shrubs that had been planted around the Yard,” she says. “They brought a sense of residential scale, which didn’t have a place there. It was more about ornamentation than the intended pure, simple New England aesthetic that the Yard has always been.” Solano makes clear the larger concept behind the Van Valkenburgh approach: “We always try to keep the spirit and understand the thinking, but we are working in our time, so we use those tools.”
 
SO FAR SO GOOD
 
In spite of his enthusiasm for preservation and restoration, Weishan is cautious when discussing the work being done on Harvard’s old buildings and landscapes. “Sometimes it’s [building and landscape restoration] to the point of making them obsolete,” he says. “They are loved literally to death because they can’t be changed.” Despite the potential for dysfunctionality, the restorations or careful maintenance of past structures at Johnston Gate, the Arnold Arboretum, and the larger Harvard Yard eschew the kind of preciousness that would likely lead to Harvard becoming a museum––the new landscapes honor the past but aren’t stuck in it.
 
As the House System renovations continue and more designers and academics get on board the preservation train, it is likely that debate surrounding preservation and restoration will intensify. But it appears that as long as those helming the restoration projects, like the landscapers I met, balance their love of innovation with a historical knowledge, they will succeed in honoring the visions of past designers while creating a campus for the future.

“Translation is a kind of poetic experimentation. There is nothing better than reading a poem through translation,” the American poet Charles Bernstein said April 9 in “The Versatorium Playbook,” a seminar exploring the challenges and rewards of poetic translation. Bernstein, a key figure in the American “language poetry” movement, was joined by the Austrian poet and novelist Peter Waterhouse, an experienced translator of German-language poetry. The duo shared their unique perspectives on translation, illustrating the positive impact translation can have on the art form of poetry, as well as on those who collaborate to translate together.
  A professor at the University of Vienna, Waterhouse designed a poetry translation class that centered on students regularly cooperating to work on translating poetry. According to Waterhouse, his students would regularly devote between 30 to 40 hours a week to translating poetry in a group setting. Asked about what types of works the class translated, Waterhouse said, “We translated anything we could get hold of, everything which was around and on the book, not just the poetry—any kind of symbols and signs were also translated. We were interested in material that cannot be translated.” Sometimes, Waterhouse and his students were not allowed to translate certain American poems due to copyright laws. Instead of translating the words into German, they illustrated the meaning of the poem through icons and pictures.
  Waterhouse and his students’ interest in translating difficult poetic works led them to become attracted to the poem “Johnny Cake Hollow” by Charles Bernstein. To Waterhouse and his students, “Johnny Cake Hollow” was fascinating because it seemed impossible to translate in terms of sound and meaning. However, Waterhouse said, “We soon came to realize that it was actually highly translatable because the poem itself was suggesting meaning at every point of every line. Thus, it was not only very translatable but also necessary to translate.” From translating Bernstein’s poem, Waterhouse and his students began to understand that meaning was not a result of translation, but instead comes from the reader’s interaction with the work. “Translation is a type of commentary. We don’t introduce meaning. If you want meaning, you have to add it,” Bernstein said.
  Most of the students who took Waterhouse’s class had no prior experience in translating poetry or even writing poetry but became interested in the theory of translation and started to produce translations themselves. By translating poems written in many different languages, the students interacted more with the poetry they were reading. “Reading poems in your language can be confining at times because they are written in your own language, so you already have a sense of what to expect. On the other hand, there is an endless amount of knowledge that can be gained from translating a poem written in a different language,” Bernstein said. 
  According to Bernstein and Waterhouse, the importance of group translation extends beyond the field of poetry. As Bernstein put it, “Group translations are about people and bringing people together.” In this vein, Waterhouse and his students have gone on expeditions to different parts of Europe, collaborating on and exchanging translations with other student-poets. During Waterhouse and his students’ expeditions, translating poetry became a medium for in-person contact and exchange that facilitated deeper understanding of the words and sounds that make up a language. Translation became an action that was different in its energy and engagement compared to the individual study of a poem in its own language. Bernstein agreed, noting that even experienced poets have a lot to gain from performing translation. “Translation allows you to garner a new meaning of the poem. I noticed that during the translation sessions with my students, I was not teaching but learning. Everyone was learning.”

Given that they spend their nights cracking jokes and playing classroom instruments on The Tonight Show, it’s commendable that The Roots have kept their own music relatively gimmick-free. Their new single, “When the People Cheer,” feels worlds apart from the smiley Fallon house band; it has no gloss, no primetime sparkle. Instead, it’s a haunting mood piece, a somber reminder that what The Roots do best has always been serious, top-shelf hip-hop.
 
Black Thought is one of the game’s most quietly virtuosic MCs, and in typical fashion, he only shows up for the track’s second half, handing off the warm-up verse to longtime collaborator Greg Porn. Porn’s verse smolders thanks to lines like “Lights, camera, chemical reaction,” but by the time Black Thought enters with shout-outs to both Jay-Z and Phil Collins, he’s officially stolen the show. The lead MC’s verse is at once brutally honest (“I’m a sex-addicted introvert,”) and thoughtful (“On my existential grind doing consequential dirt”). Instead of commenting from afar on the social issues they tackle, the two rappers place themselves in the spotlight for blistering self-critique.
 
But this wouldn’t be a Roots track without the rest of the band. Though “When the People Cheer” relies heavily on a dimly twinkling piano sample, its beat could only come from everyone’s favorite afro-sporting drummer, ?uestlove. His no-frills playing has been at the core of the band’s output from the beginning, and while attention-deficient listeners might be getting tired of the same old drum sound, its longevity is an indicator that ?uestlove and company remain serious and hands-on with their music, no matter who they play on TV.

“The Space Project” may have been doomed for fragmentation since its inception. Lefse, the record label that organized the project, invited a wide assortment of artists to compose songs for the album using “sounds” (really electromagnetic radiation interpreted as sound waves) picked up by the Voyager space probes. The album itself is divided into seven pairs of songs that act as A- and B-sides to various celestial bodies: Jupiter, Miranda (a moon of Uranus), Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Earth, and Io (a moon of Jupiter). The many-sided, Holstian endeavor seems to have been put together remotely, with no significant communication among the musicians themselves. As far as collaborative albums go, “The Space Project” is a fairly disjointed one, but the album revels in this multifaceted soundscape, turning its diffuse style into its greatest strength.
 
Ten minutes slip by before “The Space Project” offers any words; both Porcelain Raft and The Antlers choose to let their tracks grow without any vocal contributions. On “Terraform,” Mutual Benefit’s Jordan Lee breaks the silence, gently intoning, “The view from here, well it is a Martian sight: / some cratered ground and a distant, glowing light.” When the artists on “The Space Project” do speak, the vocals act as ornaments to the sampling, using simple ideas to add emotive elements to their respective tracks. The relative wordlessness of the album is apt—not only do the songs reflect the silent vacuum of space, but they also unite the 14 tracks in a showcase of expertly minimalistic songwriting.
 
This sparseness doesn’t hinder “The Space Project,” but rather gives each contributor the freedom to put his or her fingerprints on each track. The metronomic clicking that opens The Antlers’ “Jupiter” is a washed-out variation on the guitar part that opens their 2009 single, “Two,” and the lone trumpet line that joins in thereafter recalls the forlorn outro of 2011’s “Hounds.” Lee’s track is just as characteristic of his own previous discography—the arpeggiated guitar and melodic flute lines of “Terraform” could have been lifted from “Advanced Falconry” and “Golden Wake,” respectively.
 
Spiritualized (which changed its name to “Mississippi Space Program” for the sake of the project) assert themselves as the most experienced songwriters on the album, forging sample and simplicity into a slowly-burning love song that lies close to the band’s noise and space-rock roots. The lyricism in “Always Forgetting With You (The Bridge Song)” is mind-numbingly simplistic, primarily mirroring the opening lines, “If you want a radio, I will be a radio for you. / If you want an aeroplane, I will be an aeroplane for you.” But Jason Pierce’s repetitive, tin-can vocals are soon joined by splash cymbals and a sung countermelody, giving the track renewed life at the right moment and propelling it through its extended outro.
 
The album’s biggest detractor, however, is its second half, which loses momentum amongst celestial dirges alongside jumbled electronica. Beach House’s Victoria Legrand sounds tired and uninspired on “Saturn Song,” stretching out insipid lines such as “I was looking for a four-leaf clover / White snakes play summers for that gunpowder” over tedious expanses of time. Instead of feeling suspended, “Saturn Song” drags its feet throughout its four and a half minutes. Similarly, Absolutely Free’s “Earth I” is an art-punk symphony that tosses around fragments of several promising compositional ideas before dissolving, having developed none of them. “The Space Project” ends with Greek producer Larry Gus’s “Sphere of Io (For Georg Cantor),” which confusedly skirts the lines between jazz, disco, and electronica in a soup of samples and muttered vocals.
 
The tracks also treat their respective samples with varying amounts of dexterity. Porcelain Raft’s opener, “Glove,” immediately introduces the dazzling Jupiter sample to the foreground of the track before allowing it to ebb behind a steady, psychedelic waltz. Dance duo Benoit & Sergio also do justice to their sample from Io, using the glistening loop to gently introduce “Long Neglected Words.” Other samples, such as the one from Uranus used on Blues Control’s “Blues Danube,” are incorporated in a clunkier fashion. In the track’s final moments, the sample is crossfaded into a laid-back jazz-waltz, making it sound like an afterthought rather than the focal point of the track.
Though at times frustratingly diffuse, the incoherent nature of “The Space Project” is assumed confidently, making it impossible to doubt that Lefse intended for these tracks to grow independently of each other. The songs drift in and out of emotional immediacy, transitioning effortlessly (if abruptly) from the foreign tenderness of Youth Lagoon’s “Worms” to the aloof “Blues Danube.” Aside from the origin of the samples, there is little holding the tracks on “The Space Project” together—but like space itself, “The Space Project” builds and grows from its own entropy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“Rap is the new rock ’n’ roll. We the new rock stars,” Kanye West declared proudly in his infamous interview with Zane Lowe of BBC. Though it’s difficult to take something so brazen without a grain of salt, Kanye is ultimately right. Indeed, hip-hop has swept the nation and become one of the most prominent contemporary influences on American culture. But hip-hop has not always been so popularly accepted, particularly in mainstream music. 
 
In his four-part documentary “The Tanning of America,” marketing mogul Steve Stoute brilliantly illustrates the challenging and exciting process by which hip-hop music and its surrounding culture has taken over mainstream society in the past 40 years. The “tanning of America” concept explains how, through hip-hop, mainstream American culture—music and beyond—has become more diversified. Stoute’s documentary, produced by VH1 and based off of his book of the same name, is a masterfully comprehensive examination of the rich but tortured history of hip-hop. 
 
Stoute’s documentary features a fascinating and particularly eye-opening examination into the roots and gradual development of hip-hop. Beginning with a careful examination of television programs, movies, and historical events, Stoute details how African-Americans wanted to narrate and illustrate their unique culture on their own terms. Though hip-hop excited the black community, many mainstream music outlets largely rejected hip-hop music. Even when black artists finally saw major airtime on MTV in 1983 with Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean,” many of these artists often had to adjust their image in order to achieve widespread recognition. Hip-hop was different in that its artists largely refused to change themselves in order to gain popularity.
 
Ultimately, early hip-hop artists like Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay gained so much outside publicity that mainstream music outlets were forced to pay attention to rap music. This is when the “tanning of America” truly began, according to Stoute. America’s fascination with hip-hop quickly manifested itself everywhere, including Harvard; interestingly, Stoute pays careful attention to “The Source” magazine founder Jon M. Shecter ’90, who helped introduce hip-hop to the students of Harvard through WHRB, Harvard’s radio station.
 
Aside from detailing hip-hop music’s meteoric rise, Stoute explains how hip-hop culture changed American culture. Producing many, if not most, of today’s foremost music stars. It also manifests itself in clothing, television, and even politics. Furthermore, it’s not often that we consider the incredible achievements of figures like Oprah Winfrey and President Barack Obama as related to hip-hop’s struggle and ultimate success, but as Stoute and his guests point out, these achievements are necessarily interconnected. Essentially, by popularizing prominent elements of black culture in America through music, hip-hop helped to make mainstream America more comfortable with black people in powerful roles.
 
While Stoute’s documentary deserves praise for its depth and particularly effective storytelling, these aspects are far from its only strengths. The documentary relies on honest and particularly remarkable testimonies from a variety of hip-hop industry legends, including Russell Simmons, Rick Rubin, and Dr. Dre. Stoute also interviews some of the most iconic figures in hip-hop music, including Nas, Mariah Carey, and Diddy, among many others. Stoute’s narrative of the history of hip-hop not only gains credibility but also becomes much more intimate, relatable, and exciting with such recognizable faces telling the story.
 
For those who only interact with hip-hop in a party setting, it can be difficult to understand just how deep hip-hop’s profound influence—or any music’s influence, for that matter—lies. Constantly hearing artists like 2 Chainz and Future at parties can often make it seem like hip-hop music primarily strives to be fun and crazy. And while hip-hop certainly is exciting, Stoute’s apt analysis and fascinating story reminds us that hip-hop was founded—and remains rooted today—on a very profound and personal culture. 
 
Ultimately, Stoute’s “The Tanning of America” is essential to understanding the rich history and vast struggles and accomplishments of hip-hop music. More importantly, it suggests that if hip-hop was able to evolve into one of the most popular genres of music and most powerful cultural forces in a span of just 40 years, it has boundless capacities for the future.

Saturday, April 12 was swinging. In their last performance of the semester, the Harvard Jazz Bands and guests Terri Lyne Carrington (drums), Lionel Loueke (guitar), and John Lockwood (bass) performed in Sanders Theatre as a tribute to the musical influences of Herbie Hancock. While there are mixed feelings as to how institutionalizing jazz at Harvard could help to raise its status in the school’s community, many are taking the University’s push to bring in these guests, as well as new professors, as an indicator that the jazz at Harvard is moving in a positive direction.
  Without an official jazz department, band member Andrew R. Chow ’14, an active Crimson arts editor, feels that some of the top talent at Harvard is lost to joint music programs with other schools. “There is a ‘brain drain’ that is happening where the very top level of jazz musicians aren’t in these bands, maybe because they’re playing at Berklee and NEC [The New England Conservatory of Music],” he says. “There is a level of kids who study jazz pretty intensively at summer camps and are very involved with the music, and I feel like the community of the jazz band is a little different, is kind of a second ground.”          
Besides the brain drain Chow mentions, another potential downside to Harvard’s lack of a big jazz establishment is that without being awarded credit like members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra are, bringing players together can be rather challenging. “As a manager I sometimes feel like I am pulling teeth, and that is not what you want because we are here to play music and we are all here to get along and play jazz, and so I think incentivizing kids is always a way to go—especially at this school,” Monday Jazz Band manager Bradford G. Rose ’14 says. “I think one potential [solution] that we talked about the other day is adding credit to arts programs. I know a lot of schools do that for the wind ensemble...so I think that would definitely get more kids involved in the arts.”
  Another solution offered to improve jazz’s status at the school would be to make sure that players of all necessary instruments are accepted to the school. “Sometimes there is just a lack of players of a certain instrument,” Rose says. “While Harvard recruits for football and makes sure that every spot is filled, last year I was the only drummer I think on campus.” Jacob W. Gollub ’17, another band member, took matters into his own hands. “I emailed Harvard admissions and told them to look for more jazz bassists,” he says.
  As an outsider looking in, though, guest artist John Lockwood thinks that Harvard’s jazz program, despite its small size, is impressive in its own right. Regarding the suggestion of institutionalizing, he says, “Sometimes established is good, but sometimes established is okay but not always so good because when it is well established [the players] just stay within that institution. When there is less of an establishment, sometimes it encourages people to go out more, and I kind of like that aspect. You could go to clubs and you could grow and that could kind of be your school.” This suggestion seems to fit the genre, in which unexpected experimentation is encouraged. “I prefer…playing with different people every night,” Lockwood says, “and I am playing different styles. That makes it exciting.”
  Despite the differing opinions regarding making jazz a formal establishment at Harvard, there is a growing consensus that the presence of the arts at Harvard is increasing. Chow commends the decision to bring in guest musicians and to hire additional professors to help raise the status of jazz on campus. “This semester has been pretty fantastic in terms of jazz on campus with Herbie [Hancock] here and Vijay Iyer here,” he says. “I think the presence of Vijay especially as a semi-permanent professor and member of the faculty, is going to be really important in pulling more people and generating a community. And I think people really are trying to make an effort to build up the jazz scene here.” While jazz at Harvard still searches to find its rhythm, the April 12 concert filled the lower level of Sanders and drew exuberant applause. For all the program’s logistical issues, it continues to draw hard-working musicians from the student body. Even Lockwood admits, “I am very impressed with the students; they’re very talented.”

Composer, harpist, and performer of medieval music, Benjamin Bagby is currently touring the country performing “Beowulf” in its original Old English. On April 10, Bagby took his act to Harvard, performing in Paine Hall and teaching at the English Department. Before his show, Bagby sat down with The Crimson to discuss his work.
 
The Harvard Crimson: What would you call your style of medieval music? What about this genre draws you to it?
Benjamin Bagby: We have “medieval music,” and that’s a very global term. It describes a huge number of different kinds of music—church, choral, pop, you name it. But what I’m performing at Harvard is an epic poem. It’s more of a traditional music from an oral tradition that is only loosely related to medieval music. In fact, it’s more in the domain of storytelling: “epic poetry.” It’s not concert music by any means. What interests me about it is how music plays a role in a type of communication that is supposed to transmit information, feelings, and stories that tell people about where they come from. In an oral tradition, where we have no written scores that have survived, I try to find a way to make music serve as a means of reconstructing that story.
 
THC: Why your specific interest in “Beowulf?”
BB: What interests me is that texts like “Beowulf” were always perceived aurally in the time when they were told. At some point, scribes wrote them in manuscripts, and we transcribed those manuscripts, which is when they became for us by default “literature.” My job is to take “Beowulf” out of that literature box and put it back into the oral tradition, so it becomes like a performance as it was originally meant to be.
 
THC: Can you perhaps go into a little detail regarding your thought process in writing the piece you will perform?
BB: I never set out to compose anything. In fact, it’s all about the text and its meaning. I narrow down my performance parameters using what we know about performances from that time. This understanding is heavily influenced by what we can know about instruments used. The harp became the focal point of my work as I learned how it was employed as a partner with the voice. Once you can establish that instrument’s role, it answers all kinds of questions. So what you call my “thought process” is actually a discovery based on musical decisions without really “composing” anything.
 
THC: What in your personal beliefs do you think has contributed most to your perspective as an artist?
BB: I believe very strongly in the power of language, not only in the way they are spoken but also in the way they are uttered. For example, the greatest actors have fabulous voices and a fabulous relationship to their texts, and that’s an important aspect to any kind performance. And if the words themselves are also powerfully made and beautifully done with a great sense of sound, it creates music, regardless of what the tones may be. The tones are in a way secondary to the music that the language creates.
 
THC: How did the band Sequentia come about? Where does the name come from?
BB: I was in grad school finishing my degree with other music students, and we were all very motivated to perform medieval music, so we founded the ensemble. The Latin word Sequentia refers very specifically to a poetic and musical style which was very important between the ninth and 13th centuries. It is an idea of how music and text fit together. In fact, it influenced hundreds of years of musical creation during that time. You could think of it as a new musical form of the Middle Ages.
 
THC: I understand your wife is a scholar of Croatian chant. How would you say your unique interests complement each other?
BB: She’s definitely more interested in southern Europe, while I’m more interested in northern and southern European sources. But we’ve actually collaborated in the past. Ten years ago we did a recording project here at Harvard and used our time to put together a new project for our two ensembles called “Chant Wars.” It’s about the Carolingian globalization of chant.
 
THC: Have you ever considered any new directions that you’d like to pursue in your career—a new genre or perhaps a new subject matter?
BB: Medieval music is a very huge area that expands over a thousand years. You already have people concentrating in classical music who spend their whole lives dedicated to 100 years of work. And I’m dedicating my life to a variety of styles over an even longer period of time. While there are some elements of jazz and other music forms in my work, that is plenty for me!
 
THC: What advice would you give to aspiring musicians just starting to establish careers as artists?
BB: Art picks you. If you can’t imagine doing anything else, that’s a very good sign. Anyone involved in the arts should honestly ask himself or herself if this chose them. If the answer is “This chose me,” then you’re good. If the answer is “I chose this,” you should think about it some more.

“Draft Day” opens with a countdown clock. There’s a chance audience members kept that clock in the back of their brains over the course of the hour and 50 minutes it takes for the film’s truly ridiculous plot to come to a close. Though great sports films are often based on actual events—“Moneyball,” “Remember the Titans,” and “Rudy,” among others—“Draft Day” is neither based on actual events nor, presumably, a solid understanding of the National Football League draft. “Draft Day” is a far cry from Costner’s typically wonderful athletic fare like “Field of Dreams” and “Bull Durham,” and from even tamer football films that stay a little more grounded in reality.
 
Costner knows his way around sports movies. Unfortunately, he is quite literally phoning it in during much of his turn as Sonny Weaver Jr., the hotheaded general manager of the Cleveland Browns. The entire plot of “Draft Day” revolves around phone calls between Sonny and other major league football teams. Though some of the scenes are entertaining, the first phone calls set the stage for an almost totally pointless dramatic football farce as Weaver makes a trade with the Seattle Seahawks. He gives up three years of first round picks for that year’s first pick overall in the draft. Weaver makes this decision without discussing it with anyone else that runs the Browns, which causes quite a stir behind the scenes. But the audience is supposed to trust Weaver because…well, because he’s played by Kevin Costner and he has the world-weary look of a man with resolve, although it quickly becomes clear he is not very good at his job.
 
There are three major football players up for the first spot on the Cleveland Browns: the legacy child, the overly passionate risk player with heart, and the all-star first seed who’s a little too seedy for the straight-laced Costner. Of course, every NFL city in America wants the apparently flawless first-seed Bo Callahan (Josh Pence). But his perfection doesn’t sit right with GM Weaver, who starts digging up dirt on Callahan. He finds out a few incriminating things about the potential quarterback, like his inability to keep his cool during crisis. Ultimately, Weaver’s trade becomes a clear plot device as Weaver tries to find any way out of choosing Callahan; the entire film follows the same pattern of Costner putting out his own fire while trying to seem like a maverick. 
 
The rest of the plot is populated by trite stereotypes and predictable sports movie motifs. The film throws in a newly pregnant girlfriend, a recently deceased ex-coach father, and Sonny’s ex-wife and mother both badgering him to scatter said father’s ashes on the field. The entire city of Cleveland also holds an intense grudge against Weaver because he fired his dad. Jennifer Garner is heartbreakingly stereotypical as a straight-laced salary-cap manager. Her lines include gems such as “I’m a football girl,” and “I had to fight my way into this game.” In one scene she has lunch and, just so the audience knows she really is a “football girl,” eats a waffle and two bags of barbeque chips as if to give homage to a bizarro Hardee’s commercial.
 
The film gets what gusto it has from its effects: loud, sweeping music, large, bold titles, and constantly moving split screens. The moving screens give the movie punch but at times seem like an off-the-cuff decision that never quite finds its balance. Though the screen is divided, Costner and some others move in and out of their boxed frame, which becomes visually confusing.
 
Denis Leary gives a solid performance as the infuriated Browns coach who was brought to town to win a Super Bowl title for the city of Cleveland. The film’s recurring banter about the downtrodden state of Cleveland sports is also fairly entertaining; P. Diddy even makes a humorous cameo as an agent to the stars, and an intern’s attempts to answer Weaver’s phone (on draft day, of all days) merit a chuckle.
 
Though as a movie “Draft Day” is more or less mediocre, it could make for entertaining popcorn fare for diehard football fans. Overall, “Draft Day” offers a somewhat interesting look behind the curtain of the NFL draft just in time to coincide with this year’s real draft day. Perhaps as the Houston Texans ponder the merits of Blake Bortles and Jadeveon Clowney they’ll get some laughs out of the trading tactics portrayed in the movie. Unfortunately, the film overloads itself with shallow plot devices that keep it from achieving the heartfelt quality of superior sports movies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the weather slowly shifts from a brutal winter apocalypse to the cool caressesof spring, I find myself wondering along with my fellow seniors: “Is it here? Has senior spring finally arrived?” The thought of such a wondrous prospect has sustained us for so long. It kept us moving as we typed deliriously in Lamont at three in the morningsurrounded by pretzel bags and energy drinks. It pushed us to keep going as we sat hunchedover our computers, studying for midterms before break. My personal image of senior spring haunted me all winter: By day, I sit clad inexplicably in a large white sunhat, drinking Blue Moons in the sun with a bevy of young comrades. By night, I rage.
But now that it is here—senior spring is, by all technicalities, here—I am afraid for two reasons. First, because I have hyped it up so much in my head, I worry that this spring is going to inevitably fail to reach expectations. But more importantly, frankly, I think I might not be up to it. I’ve gotten comfortably used to cozying up in bed after an early dinner. My sweatpants have become my own form of snakeskin and I’m not sure I’m quite ready to shed it.
Seniors put so much pressure on senior spring. Past seniors tell us: “It’s the best time of your life. Omg. Take me back.” I love hearing this, and I am so excited to experience my own last two months. Everyone concurs it is a truly special time. But I also have a slight suspicion that going into this spring with the expectation that it is going to be the absolute, determinate BEST thing ever might not be the smartestway to go about it. I have learned that when I go into anything with impossibly high assumptions, I am always disappointed.
I have also already noticed a tendency to label each event and moment we now attend as epically fun and memorable. We stay late at a party that we secretly hate because we feel that we can’t possibly leave—it’s senior spring and every last moment counts! I feel guilty for not going to an event that I’ve never enjoyed because it’s the very lastone and I’m going to regret it foreverif I don’t go. There’s the unspoken rule senior spring that you can never say no. But that rule ignores many exceptions. I have found that sometimes choosing bed and a snack (night cheese!) reallyisbetter than remaining at a party where I’m sweaty, tired, sore-throated and surrounded by tools. Not always. But sometimes.
It’s definitely possible that I’m just boring. Going out now just takes so much more effort for me than it used to. Drunken deep conversations half heard over the sounds of Jason DeRulo are not as fun as I remember. I can’t take a shot without suffering a near death experience. Heavy drinking at night leads to the hangover from hell in the morning (now devoid of all cure since Leo’s closed). Will I be able to handle the fantastic, decadent fun that senior spring promises? This probably sounds ridiculous—I’m twenty-three, on the edge of life! I need to suck it up! But I know I’m not alone when I say one weekend night now entails a three-day recovery.
I have some ideas for preempting these concerns. Although we are all anticipating an amazing few months, it is also important to remember that putting too much pressure and emphasis on anything is bound to spoil it. Let’s be honest when an experience is just not thatawesome. It will make the moments that are actually wonderful special, rather than ladenwith mediocrity.
We should definitely make sure to spend our next two months engaging with others, hanging out with our friends, and enjoying our time together. Senior spring is absolutely about being social. But that doesn’t mean we should be social 24/7, guilt-tripping each other for taking one night off. A girl’s gotta sleep sometimes! Alternatively, for those who feel they have become as boring as I have, staying in does not have to be a solitary activity. A bottle of wine and Netflix is better with company.
I’ve always been told that senior spring is about excess—too much fun, too little sleep. I’m sure that is going to be true.But amidthat excess, it is possible to find occasional balance. Let’s dance the night away these next two months—with abreak every now and then to survey the floor.

If lack of abundant policing and decentralization are the principal virtues of the Internet,  they’re not without their downsides. That much was made clear by the disclosure of a major vulnerability in OpenSSL—a key Internet security method—that researchers have since dubbed the “Heartbleed” bug.
Up to two-thirds of websites—including major sites like Facebook and Google— relied on the flawed OpenSSL protocol after the bug was introduced by a single German programmer in an update two years ago. The code was reviewed by an OpenSSL developer, but neither the programmer nor that developer noticed the flaw before it was adopted by millions of sites to encrypt sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and health records sent between users and company servers.
While there has not been any evidence that hackers exploited the bug to gain access to unauthorized information, the thought that the world’s most technologically sophisticated companies were unaware of a major security flaw for two years is not reassuring.
As it stands todays, cybersecurity rests on a house of cards, with much of the Internet’s users relying on open-source software that usually works well. But when it doesn’t, it’s up to the good will of cybersecurity researchers or self-motivated people to inform the rest of the world of the latest security vulnerabilities. Today, Internet usage is a necessity for most, but it’s one that leaves us always dependent on the kindness of strangers.
Broadly speaking, there are two groups that exploit security flaws like Heartbleed: criminals and intelligence agencies. And while it doesn’t appear that malcontented hackers made use of the loophole, an article published in Bloomberg alleged that the National Security Agency had known of the flaw and exploited it for years. The Obama administration and NSA have both issued denials.
Even if the NSA knew of Heartbleed, the collection of vulnerabilities is not altogether sinister. After all, the essential job of the NSA is to get into places other people do not want them to be.
There is a broader conversation to be had about the wisdom of stockpiling of so-called “zero-day vulnerabilities”—flaws that developers have zero days to repair. The President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies urged that the government “should generally move to ensure that zero days are blocked” and only use them rarely for “high priority intelligence collection.”
As the benefits from an Internet-dependent world accelerate, so too do the rewards of exploiting security flaws for intelligence agencies and criminals alike.
Striking the correct balance between the needs for collectively decided security protocols and decentralization will be a difficult task. But it’s one that will need to happen soon.

Exactly one year ago, I ran the Boston Marathon. Today, I took my oath to become an intelligence officer in the United States Navy.
It’s often said that in works of fiction, action reveals character. But, much as I like to imagine myself as the protagonist in some fantastic rom-com, sci-fi-suspense-thriller, the same cannot be said of real life. It is the character of an action that reveals character. In other words, how one makes big decisions makes all the difference. The thoughts and conversations that led up to my decision to join the military are worth consideration for many other Harvard students.
I joined for many reasons, not least of which were the events I witnessed in Boston one year ago. We talk a lot about privilege at Harvard, but some privileges are more oftenoverlooked than others. In the United States we all share in our relative freedom and safety, but it is easy to forget them in the absence of a major disruption of these privileges, especially when someone else is picking up the check.
It’s easy to pay lip service to grand platitudes about the honor of military service, but sometimes the details worry me. I’ll miss the snooze button on my alarm, my long hair,and being able to sleep on an unmoving flat surface. But my circadian rhythm will adapt, my hair will grow back, and I’ll get my sea legs. Sometimes the little things encourage me. I’m going to wear the uniform, read “Moby Dick” on an aircraft carrier, and constantly make seaman puns. Also I have it on good authority that service members pay discount price at Disney World.
Honestly, the difficulty of getting into Harvard and running marathons did not compare to enormity of signing on that dotted line.
I’m a vegetarian from Oakland, California, a Harvard student, and I write for On Harvard Time. I don’t exactly fit the mold of most officers in the military. I can’t make a bed worth a darn; I can be pig-headed and selfish. However these are not excuses to avoid the military,but motivations to join. There are all kinds of lessons to be learned after graduation.
Sometimes I picture graduating from Harvard to become a naval intelligence officer as leaving Athens for Sparta. But in so many ways being an officer in the military and being a student at Harvard are similar.
The military, like Harvard, has its fair share of songs, Latin mottos, crests, and distinctive jargon. Within the five branches of the military, the Navy has a longstanding gentleman’s rivalry with the Army, culminating in a football game familiarly referred to as “The Game.” You hear a similar intake of breath when you inform someone you’ve enlisted in the military or enrolled at Harvard. Though, to be sure, it’s true the phrase “dropping the H-bomb” has a slightly different meaning in the military. However, both Harvard and the military attract international attention with the ways they wield their resources and influence.
The Navy and Harvard, though both proud emblems of American culture, precede the existence of the United States. Both love to number the U.S. presidents they can claim as veterans or alumni. Finally, it’s important to clarify that as an officer,just as a Harvard student,you are in the elite.Officer applicants face an admissions rate that rivals that of many Ivy Leagues.
Most importantly, both institutions unite people from all walks of life through mutual experience. Whether it’s surviving boot camp or surviving CS50, there is a tremendous camaraderie that comes from the experience of hardship. This is camaraderie undiminished by the diaspora following graduation.
I had heard the stories of the brave men and women who enlisted September 12, 2001. Yet I realize now that cut off from those stories are the sacrifices, the uncertainties, the moments of indecision, and the frantic Google searches in the twilight hours that they had to first overcome.
I will be running the marathon again this Monday as student and future officer, with my Harvard career behind me and my military career ahead.What will get me to the finish line is the resolve that got me to the starting line—the same commitment that got me to write my name on the dotted line.

If I want to be a serious lady power player, I’m going to need to purchase a blazer. It’s going to be black or navy blue, it’s going to cinch at the waist and flair at the hips, and, damnit, it’s going to get me taken seriously. This, at least, was my first takeaway from last week’s Harvard Political Union discussion on “the future of feminism.” My second was that it might be more effective to ditch the blazers entirely.
The debate, between leaders of the campus chapter of “Lean In” and from two of the College’s feminist collectives, was an important one for all of us here at Harvard. I’m not a huge fan of Sheryl Sandberg’s: I don’t think she’s evil or the downfall of feminism, but I do think her top-down approach, with its attendant focus on individual achievement, is not nearly as effective and important as systemic change.  Lots of smart people have made great critiques of Sandberg’s stances, and in some ways, the furor around Sandberg steals airtime from less privileged voices saying more important things. Yet there’s at least one point that comes up frequently in Sandberg’s work that merits more discussion: the argument that women at the top will help other women. It’s a notion fundamental to a lot of feminism, including Sandberg’s, and it’s one that doesn’t always hold up.
It’s rhetoric familiar to anyone who’s ever fantasized about a matriarchal takeover: put women in charge, and the world will be a better place. And maybe it would be. The United Nations, for one, seems to think so: not only do various UN actors portray investment in women as vital for economies, they also posit that women can play a special role as peacekeepers. It’s rhetoric that can be problematic in its recourse to gender essentialist notions of women’s intrinsic peacefulness and thrift, and it can reaffirm sometimes-harmful development practices. Yet it’s an appealing and intuitive idea, and one that ultimately—in organizing efforts led by folks advocating for their communities—is the opposite of the top-down approach with which Sandberg has paired it.
At the leadership level, there’s a lot of evidence on Sandberg’s side. No woman or group of women can speak for all, but when the GOP hosts hearings on contraception without one female-bodied person to testify, the importance of representation seems clear enough. And more in line with Sandberg’s argument is the role of female leaders in changing perceptions around gender norms. Harvard Kennedy School researcher Rohini Pande, for example, has found that exposure to female leaders can help alter male voters’ perceptions of women’s roles in society. Sandberg gets this much correct: Representation is powerful. Role models are important.
But one woman’s role model is another’s oppressor. In an article critiquing Hana Rosin’s The End of Men, Notheastern University Law Professor Aziza Ahmed points to just this. While Rosin lauds powerful women like Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Madeline Albright in her book, she also presents a chapter on female violence in which stereotyped black, Muslim, and working class white women are portrayed as perpetrators of violence. Against the grain, Ahmed argues that the women responsible for the most violence in this world are often precisely those with the most power. Madeline Albright’s defense of anti-Iraq sanctions in 1996, Aziz argues, “justified the death of approximately 500,000 children,” while Laura Bush, in urging the country to go to war in Afghanistan out of “devotion to women’s rights,” promoted a conflict that killed and displaced thousands of women, not to mention reinforced dehumanizing conceptions of Muslim women as perpetually in need of rescue—results antithetical to the aim of female empowerment.
The numerous women in Congress who don’t support the social or economic policies that would help working class women keep afloat point to the same phenomenon: having women in leadership roles (to be sure, a goal in and of itself) is not a panacea—and plenty of women leaders do more harm than good.
There are 200 people on the Harvard “Lean In” listserv. That’s around one in 30 people at the College. That’s a lot of folks, with a lot of potential power, who believe that all other things being equal, women still get the short end of the stick—an idea that appears radical to a few of our fellow Harvardians. But for many women at Harvard, who have substantial educational privilege—and particularly those who come from backgrounds of socioeconomic and racial advantage, too-—it’s important to remember that leaning in for ourselves is not exactly fighting for the liberation of all womankind. The identities, struggles, and backgrounds of some render their very presence in the halls of power a radical gesture. But for many on this campus, leaning in isn’t enough. We need to start listening up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor,
Along with other members of the Harvard Community, I read President Faust’s recent letter about climate change with great interest.Bravo! Every single university, college, school and organization will have to make climate its top priority if our species is to survive on this planet.
Climate catastrophe is happening much faster than the scientific community has predicted. Scientists are by nature doubters and must certainly and necessarilycompromise in order to find the broadest possible consensus.Consequently, many of the leading scientific organizations have overestimated the amount of time left to fix the problem and equivocated far too much about the impact of climate on specific events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and drought.
The Harvard community would do well to reflect on this and decide whether the time has come to chain ourselves to the White House fence.
Ecological apocalypse is happening now.Even here in our island paradise of Hawaii we see it every day.Our coral reefs are under assault from a bacterial disease that seemtohave been unleashed either by rising temperatures or increased ocean acidity.I work with the Fish and Wildlife Service in an effort to save the rare and endangered Koloa Duck, a native Hawaiian species, from extinction at the hands of a virulent strain of avian botulism.
We all need to ask ourselves what more we can do.
How many professors and administrators could cut back on their travel and confer with distant colleagues via the web? And how many students could reduce their air travel.And every single one of us could do better using public transportation.Should all car traffic be banned in Cambridge? Should the parking rates be quadrupled or parking eliminated altogether? London and Berlin and other cities are doing just these kinds of things.
These are just a few thoughts. But, Harvard does on this issue will havean outsized impact on the world. Let us hope it not too little and too late.

Mike Huckabee, former Republican presidential candidate and Governor of Arkansas, discussed the possibility of seeking the Republican presidential nomination once more in 2016 while speaking at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.
“Honestly, I just need to see, politically and financially, a viable path to the nomination,” Huckabee said. “And if I feel like there is, I feel like I have ideas that belong on the national stage. Maybe I’ll give it a shot.”
The event was moderated by IOP Director C.M. Trey Grayson '94, with conversation mostly gravitating towards Huckabee’s early political career, the operation of his state government, and the difficulties of running a national campaign.
Huckabee was first elected to office after a special election for lieutenant governor in 1993, when former United States president Bill Clinton left the position for the White House. Huckabee spoke about the 12 years he spent in the pastorate prior to seeking public office, which he described as a detour that nearly became his final career choice.
After the discussion, Huckabee fielded questions from the crowd on topics including gay marriage, abortion, and the future of the Republican party. When speaking on the vital role that compromise plays in quality government, he criticized the hostile nature of the Washington political theater.
“The atmosphere [in Washington] is so polarized,” Huckabee said. “Both sides have decided that they want everything and they want it now, and if you want everything and you want it now, you’ll get nothing and you’ll get it forever.”
He also said he was disappointed in both President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for deviating from the positions they took against gay marriage in 2008.
Huckabee’s comments elicited several combative reactions from one audience member, who interrupted the governor several times, also questioning Huckabee's comments on gay marriage.
Huckabee is the first of three conservative heavy-hitters to appear on campus in the coming weeks. 2008 GOP presidential nominee and Arizona Senator John McCain will speak at the IOP next Wednesday, and former GOP presidential candidate and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul will be on campus next Friday.

The Harvard-Allston Education Portal formalized on Monday night a new community outreach initiative which aims to combine in-person faculty-led discussions with courseware from HarvardX.
Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol delivered the evening’s lecture to around 75 residents gathered in Allston as it was simultaneously streamed online. The event, which was part of a series known as “On-Ramp,” was designed to provide a connection between Harvard faculty and community members.
“Our hope is to expand over time the offerings for HarvardX and Allston,” said Robert A. Lue, the faculty director of HarvardX and the the Education Portal. “It’s an opportunity for us to build programs that help the community of Allston connect with information in the digital age.”
The Portal, created in 2008, offers mentoring and enrichment opportunities for neighborhood children and educational programs for adults. The HarvardX for Allston project is funded by a multimillion-dollar community benefits package approved last October as part of the University’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston. That package set aside  $10 million for a “transformative suite of projects” for the Portal, including an array of new programming.
Lue also mentioned plans to move the Portal from its existing space to a new “iStudio”—a larger space to develop, film, and livestream MOOCs—currently slated to be built next door to the Harvard ceramics studio in Allston early next year.
“We’ve seen from the very beginning with HarvardX that it’s an online thing, but we’re trying to encourage more in-person interaction to bring the community together,” Lue said. “What always struck me was I kept seeing members of the community that haven’t really plugged into the digital age yet—even if they had a smartphone, they weren’t aware of how much it could be used for.”
The Portal is designed to enable both the Allston community to learn from Harvard faculty and to provide Harvard with the ability to research what makes for effective learning both in the classroom and online, Lue said in an interview after the event.
“It’s a portal for both Harvard and the Allston community, so it’s a bi-directional relationship,” Lue said. “These are like test-run pilots. We are going to see what combination of things really enable a community to come together.”
Reaction to Portal programming has been very positive in the Allston-Brighton community, according to Bruce E. Houghton, a Newton resident who attended the event and is a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, the body that reviewed the community benefits package that included new funding for the Portal.
As with any new community initiative, the Education Portal will have to make every effort to advertise and entice Allston-Brighton residents to utilize its resources, Houghton added.
“When you try something new, you try everything to get people involved and excited,” Houghton said.
“We are anticipating that Harvard [expands] this kind of programming,” said Fran M. Gardino, a Brighton resident who attended the event. “Allston-Brighton is very happy that there is a lot of educational activity coming over into Allston from Harvard.”
Following his lecture, Bol led an open discussion of the Chinese folk story of YingYing, a narrative teeming with conflict between sexuality, mortality, and Buddhism that was the subject of his lecture. The discussion allowed for both in-person and online participation.

Remaining a presence on Harvard’s campus after her Sunday evening performance, Yardfest headliner Janelle Monáe attended two award ceremonies on Monday recognizing her achievements as an artist, advocate, and feminist model.
Monáe was awarded the inaugural 2014 Award for Achievement in Arts and Media by the Harvard College Women’s Center and was also recognized as the 2014 Woman of the Year by the Black Men’s Forum at their 20th annual Celebration of Black Women Gala. These two campus groups each announced their respective awards in March, and have worked since early fall to coordinate Monáe’s visit to campus with the College Events Board.
Program Coordinator for the Women’s Center Keith Grubb ’14 said the various awards allowed campus groups to recognize the impact Monáe’s work has had on numerous intersecting communities.
“It’s important to highlight the various nuances and intersections of her identity,” Grubb said.
In her introductory speech for the artist, Administrative Coordinator for The Women’s Center Bridget Duffy similarly commended Monáe for highlighting the stories of women and advocating for equality regardless of gender, race, or sexuality.
Duffy later added that she believed the multi-purpose nature of Monáe’s visit to Harvard enriched the experience both for the artist and for Harvard students.
“I don’t think different groups [recognizing Monáe] lessens the awards in any way,” Duffy said. “I think it adds a lot of depth and nuance to someone’s visit to Harvard.”
Monáe shared personal stories about her past at both award ceremonies. During a student-led interview with the Women’s Center that followed the presentation of her award, she spoke at length about her grandmother and mother, both of whom never finished school but whom she credited for her success.
She also revealed that her signature tuxedo stage outfit was inspired by the stereotypical black-and-white housemaid outfit, paying homage to her time as a maid moonlighting as a musician.
“Embrace the things that make you unique, even if it makes people uncomfortable,” she said.
At the BMF gala, where she gave the keynote address, Monáe also noted that the title of her album, “Electric Lady,” did not imply that she was “the” powerful and successful woman but that she was part of a group of powerful women with unique stories.
“I stand among an army of like-minded electric ladies and electric men,” she said.
In addition to Monáe, the BMF honored five black female seniors for their achievements and contributions to the Harvard community: Yolanda K. Borquaye ’14, Erin D. Drake ’14, Walenda “Peggy” Mativo ’14, Lauren F. Alexander ’14, and Lindiwe-Claudia Rennert ’14.
Sam R. Mendez ’14, who attended the Women’s Center award ceremony, said that the event exposed him to a side of Monáe he did not see at Yardfest.
“You get a certain amount of her ideas and her world views from the lyrics of her music, but you get a little more of her  as a person and less of a persona if you get to hear her answer questions and hear her speak about her life,” Mendez said.

UPDATED: April 15, 2014, at 1:44 a.m.
Responding to concerns raised by Quincy residents, the Undergraduate Council voted Monday to urge College administrators to cover summer storage costs for undergraduates whose Houses have undergone renovation. 
Quincy House masters first informed residents that on-campus storage space would no longer be available after renovations on the House commenced three years ago.
Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper '94 has said that the efforts of the House renewal project to increase the amount of common space in each House took priority over storage. Quincy’s recently renovated Stone Hall, for example, once housed summer storage in its basement. Today, however, it features more common space that has replaced the storage facilities.
For the two summers while construction was underway, Harvard fully funded off-campus storage options for students living more than 150 miles away from campus. But since construction ended, the College has ceased to pay for off-campus storage for Quincy residents and has instead offered residents a slightly discounted rate for storage through the company Collegeboxes.
Quincy resident Kevin Q. Hilgartner '16 spoke at the UC meeting Monday, conveying frustration with how the Office of Student Life and other House administrators have responded to the growing student concerns about storage.
According to Hilgartner, off-campus storage could cost Quincy residents more than $150 each. Residents of other Houses, on the other hand, will not have to pay for storage until construction concludes on their dormitories.
The shift in policies, Hilgartner said, revealed “a pattern of administrative disregard for undergraduates.”
After the meeting, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 said that failing to pay for summer storage goes against the values embraced by the University, including a commitment to ease the financial burden on students.
“Part of what makes Harvard so great is that it has an incredible diversity of students and socioeconomic [diversity] is part of that…. It’s not fair to bring students and pay for everything, and then throw additional costs at them whenever the administration feels like it,” Mayopoulos said.
According to UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 and Mayopoulos, students who need storage space must individually petition the Financial Aid Office to further subsidize storage costs.
Goffard said that storage officials told him and Mayopoulos that the budget for Quincy House renewal allocated about $30,000 a year for off-campus storage.
Given that University officials raised concerns about increasing the Undergraduate Council fee, Mayopoulos said he failed to understand how the College could now ask some students to pay for storage.
“I literally don't see how you could say those two things and take yourself seriously,” Mayopoulos said.
UC leaders also announced at the meeting that they will be holding a forum this Wednesday with University President Drew G. Faust, in which undergraduates will be able to ask her questions.
In addition, the Council launched its Freshman Health Project week, an initiative Mayopoulos alluded to in his first presidential address to students. FHP Director Ingrid Y. Li '17, said that the project is designed to teach freshmen healthy practices and stress management techniques. Going forward, Li said the UC will likely host a health week every fall in collaboration with other advocacy groups.

UPDATED: April 15, 2014, at 5:30 p.m.
The Pershing Square Foundation, a family-based philanthropic organization, announced a $17 million gift to the University Monday to fund an interfaculty initiative that will investigate the driving forces of human behavior. 
The initiative, entitled the Harvard Foundations of Human Behavior, will use the gift to endow three new professorships and establish a $5 million research venture fund that will award grants to Harvard faculty and graduate students.
Spearheaded by behavioral economist David Laibson, the FHB supports interdisciplinary research in fields that range from biology to psychology to economics. It also facilitates the design and discovery of “cost-effective, scalable interventions that improve societal well-being,” Laibson said in a press release.
The Pershing Square Foundation, which was founded in 2006 by Bill Ackman '88 and his wife, Karen Ackman '93, supports social innovations geared towards sustainable impact. Paul Bernstein, the CEO of the Pershing Square Foundation, noted that the organization has a three-pronged mission.
“One is backing exceptional people,” Bernstein said. “Second is backing those people with ideas to implement the often disruptive but best innovations, which leads to the third thing, which is scalable impact.”
As Bernstein explained, scaling innovations—growing ventures to extend their impact—is relatively rare among existing philanthropies. 
“We’re really interested in carving out that niche and being able to drive some of that impact that comes from scaling ventures,” Bernstein said.
Bernstein noted that he hoped that recent donation would facilitate two goals. 
First, the Foundation aims to attract the most talented minds to delve further into interdisciplinary behavioral science at Harvard.
 
The first of three Pershing Square professorships has already been awarded to Matthew Rabin, a behavioral economist who will join the economics faculty this summer. He studies the economics of individual self-control, errors in probabilistic reasoning, and fairness motives.
 
The second mission of the Foundation, Bernstein said, centers on the research fund, which will award grants to ideas and ventures that address challenges ranging from poverty among farmers and students to the spread of epidemics in rural communities. 
According to Bernstein, the Foundation prizes ideas that will have the potential to affect worldwide change and connect individuals across the University.
 
“We’re looking especially for projects that entail collaboration across all of Harvard,” he said.
 
Collaboration is a key word for the partnership between the Foundation and Harvard. Since Harvard already has several established social entrepreneurial groups and research laboratories that study human behavior and societal interaction, Bernstein noted that the FHB initiative will work inside the existing framework rather than implement its own system of awarding grants.
 
“This should be an initiative, rather than something that builds another center with its own function, precisely with the goal of maximizing relationship-building with other programs,” Bernstein said.
 
The Pershing Square Foundation has given out $235 million in grants and social investments since its founding eight years ago. Yet, Bernstein noted that the new Harvard program promises to fulfill a unique niche. 
“There is so much potential when we develop at somewhere as important and special as Harvard a cross-disciplinary academic discipline on something as important as human behavior,” Bernstein said.
The Pershing Square gift also includes $4 million to endow a chair in global health for University professor Paul E. Farmer, as well as $5 million for the men's crew team.

During an address at the Business School on Monday, former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon argued that although private sector companies are often hesitant to adopt climate change initiatives, minimizing carbon emissions may prove extremely profitable. 
 
The conversation, which was titled “Climate Change and Business,” attracted dozens of graduate students from the Business and Kennedy Schools.
 
Calderon highlighted how global leaders were still reluctant to address climate change only a few years ago, specifically mentioning an international conference in Copenhagen in 2009. 
“Not all leaders and countries felt involved in the issue at that time,” Calderon said.
Nevertheless, Calderon noted that leaders have grown increasingly cognizant of the problems posed by climate change.
“[Today,] climate change is the most important challenge for a human being,” Calderon said.
 
Calderon pointed out a false dilemma many leaders in the private sector believe they face when trying to implement policies to reduce carbon emissions. 
According to Calderon, many believe that “either you tackle climate change or you create economic growth.”
 
Those two goals, Calderon argued, are not mutually exclusive. 
“It is possible to maximize economic growth under the restrictions of carbon emission reductions,” he said.
 
Calderon noted that the public sector can help shape policy to incentivize private companies to invest in climate-friendly programs. Public policy, he said, can provide a powerful stimulus for companies to change the way they invest.
 
 “We can propose profitable businesses for people and companies, we can propose public policies that are able to create jobs and economic growth, and we can change the [way] in which we are deciding development starting today [to create] real development [that considers] the risks associated with climate change in the future,” Calderon said.
 
Rebecca M. Henderson, a Business School professor, moderated the discussion, and said that sustainable investments can still be profitable. 
She also said that the private sector may need something to galvanize it, noting that “sometimes we need a market signal to get people focused in these areas.”
 
Calderon said that hesitation could cost private companies potential profits. 
“Companies are delaying all their decisions about the environment,” Calderon said. “That implies an economic cost.”
 
Maria Melas, an attendee who graduated from the Extension School with a degree in Environmental Management, found the talk particularly engaging.
“The most interesting thing is focusing on the economy and making economic suggestions for how to change things, which in turn will help the climate,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 15, 2014, at 8:30
This is the first in a weeklong series of articles chronicling Harvard’s remembrance of the Boston Marathon Bombings that occured a year ago.
For the Harvard affiliates running in last year’s Boston Marathon, it was a picture-perfect mid-April morning and a pleasant, if difficult, run through Boston’s suburbs.
“It was a beautiful day, and it was a great run,” Patrick Rooney ’14 remembered in an interview last week. “It was just a really incredible run. And I think people forget that, for good reason, but it was a really beautiful day.”
Rooney was one of dozens of affiliates who had crossed into Boston to take part in one of the area’s most treasured spring traditions. Many ran, and countless others watched and cheered along the 26.2 mile course from Hopkinton to Back Bay’s Copley Square.
And then, shortly before 2:50 p.m., just yards from the Boylston St. finish line, two homemade explosive devices detonated within seconds of each other, injuring hundreds on the spot and eventually killing three.
Rooney, who was just blocks away from the finish when the bombs went off, said that he didn’t know what was happening at first. Neither did those across the river, rushing through their end-of-term Monday schedules, who heard the news in fragmented spurts of short breaking reports and social media postings.
“[It was] kind of an earthquake feeling, turning around and seeing the first one,” Rooney said. “And then the second one happened a few seconds later.... It was a very localized thing around those two blasts. I think people that were at the finish line and people that were maybe a block away...could see everything, could hear everything.”
But further up the course, those who were still running—many without cell phones or any communication devices—remained in the dark. Sara R. Siskind ’14, a Crimson editorial editor, had entered the race unofficially a few miles in to help pace a friend.
“This race official or policeman, I don’t remember, stopped me,” Siskind said in an interview last week. “I just remember thinking, ‘You don’t know. I’m running the Boston Marathon. You don’t just tell me to stop.’”
But the runners had to stop. With hundreds injured on Boylston street, with the finish line cluttered with debris and medical personnel, the race could not go on. The unfinished race left thousands of runners on the course with spectators and relatives wondering if their friends and loved ones were safe or not.
Eventually, all of the Harvard affiliates who ran the race made it back to a campus which had experienced dozens of unfounded bomb scares and a partial evacuation of the John F. Kennedy School of Government .
Krystle Campbell, a former Business School employee whose brother and mother have also worked at the University, suffered critical injuries in the blasts. Campbell succumbed to her injuries soon thereafter, and was among three who lost their lives in the bombings.
James Costello, a mail services employee at Harvard, survived the attack but was photographed walking away from the bomb site with singed skin and charred clothing.
Back on campus, Harvard’s runners and spectators were met by students who had experienced the day from a distance.
“It was hard to go back into Annenberg for the first time and see so many people in such a small space...like nothing had changed,” Elizabeth A. Melampy '16 said last week. “And for me so much had changed. So just to have that...atmosphere was really, really hard.”
Rooney remembered the news hitting him after he returned to campus.
“At that point it was really sinking in that this was something that was going to be very tragic, very sad, a real test to the community,” he said. “I just wanted normalcy.... I just remember feeling like ‘I don’t want to be in Boston right now.’”
In the days that followed, the investigation into the bombings would bring the conflict even closer to home. On Thursday, two days after the explosions, the FBI released images of the alleged perpetrators, later identified as Cambridge residents Tamerlan and Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev. As Harvard mourned its lost and injured, the Tsarnaev brothers rampaged through Cambridge, Allston, and Watertown on Thursday night and Friday morning, killing MIT Police officer Sean Collier and eventually drawing police into a shootout. The manhunt, which put much of greater Boston and Harvard on lockdown, ended with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s capture Friday evening in Watertown.
Now, a year later, scores of Harvard student and affiliates are poised to return to the finish line on Boylston Street.
“What makes me so happy is a lot of students, I hear, are going this year,” said Kerry M. Flynn ’14, a Crimson news editor, who watched the race from the sidelines last year. “You’re going to miss one day of class, it’s okay. It’s so much more important to go out and cheer on some friends and just be a part of a memorable day in your life.”
Melampy, who last year never made it to finish, said that she relishes the opportunity to have another chance at the famed course.
“There are so many people that want to run this race and to be able to do it again is really awesome,” she said. “I’m really just excited to spend time on the course. I’m slow, I’m not going to win.... I’m just going to take my time on this course with all these beautiful people and I’m really, really excited to get to do that.”
The 118th running of the Marathon is set for next Monday, and according to race chairman Dave McGillivray, 36,000 runners—9,000 more than last year—have entered the race.
The Harvard College Marathon Challenge, a running group which sent around 20 runners to last year’s race on non-profit exemptions—the other, more popular, way to run the Marathon is to earn a spot by running a certain time at a qualifying event—will send a group of similar size to this year’s race, according to HCMC chair Craig Rodgers. 
More will run in honor of friends and family who never finished a year ago, remembering the long shadow cast on a picture-perfect day in April.

As hundreds came together across Boston on Tuesday to mark the one-year anniversary of the bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon, members of the Harvard community had a quieter day of reflection and remembrance in and around Harvard Yard.
Throughout the day, students braved wind and rain to write on message boards posted in the Science Center Plaza and by Memorial Church. Many of the messages were addressed to first responders and law enforcement officials—from the Harvard University Police Department and other local units—that played a central role in the aftermath of the bombing and in the manhunt that ensued three days later.
“I cannot thank you enough,” read one message addressed to the Boston Police Department and the Harvard University Police Department. “[I] love this community and [am] so proud to be both a native New Yorker and adopted Bostonian. Boston Strong.”
Another message read: “Thank you to all who stood by us in our direst hour of need. We salute you all on behalf of the campus, the greater city of Boston, and the world.”
In the afternoon, Memorial Church hosted nearly 100 people in a service of silent reflection. The hourlong service culminated at 2:49 p.m.—the time of the explosions—with a tolling of the church’s bells, sounded in sync with bells across the Boston metropolitan area. Throughout the hour, community members either sat in silence or chatted softly with others in their pews. Some wore official Boston Marathon apparel, and many carried daffodils that were distributed Tuesday at Memorial Church and the Science Center Plaza.
“It was comforting to know that I would be able to have a more formal space and time to process and reflect on last year with the 2 p.m. event at Memorial Church,” Ginny C. Fahs ’14, a Crimson magazine editor, wrote in an email on Tuesday afternoon. Fahs attended the reflection service and will run the marathon next Monday for the second consecutive year. “My brain made so many lasting memories that day, and the anniversary has brought these images and memories flooding back.”
The reflection period in Memorial Church was a chance for community members, many of whom are preparing to return to the marathon next week, to remember the victims of last year’s explosions.
Krystle M. Campbell, a former Business School employee, was among three killed in the explosions last April. She had been waiting at the Boylston Street finish line to watch a friend complete the race when the first of the two explosions detonated.
Campbell, who was 29 and had been working weekends at the Business School’s Spangler Grille while attending the University of Massachusetts-Boston, is survived by her parents, Patricia and William Campbell Jr., and her brother William Campbell III. Both Krystle Campbell’s mother and brother have worked for the University—her mother with Business School Restaurant Services and her brother with Cabot House dining services.
In the year since her death, members of the Boston community have honored her memory by contributing to her memorial fund, established by the Boston Foundation, which pays for scholarships at Campbell’s high school, Medford High School, and supports the Angell Animal Medical Center and organizations that help autistic children. Seventeen runners will race next week in honor of Campbell to raise awareness for this fund, including a group from the Business School.
In addition, a trustee at the University of Massachusetts Boston set up a scholarship in memory of Campbell. The City of Medford, Campbell’s hometown, recently announced a $1 million project to build a peace garden honoring the lives of Campbell and other victims.
“One year later, our entire family continues to grieve for the loss of our wonderful, smiling, and vivacious daughter, Krystle Marie Campbell,” Campbell’s parents read in a statement addressed to the Boston community last Friday. “There is not a day that passes without our thinking of our daughter.”
Tuesday was a day of ceremonies across the Boston metropolitan area. In the morning, wreaths were placed at the two explosion sites at Boylston Street. Later in the day, Vice President Joe Biden headlined a roster of dignitaries in attendance at a tribute held at Hynes Convention Center.
“You are living proof that America can never, never, never be defeated,” Biden said, addressing the families of those killed in the blast and its aftermath. “You’re here. You’re undeterred, and you’re unyielding.”
In addition to Campbell, 8-year-old Martin Richard of Dorchester and Lu Lingzi, a 23-year-old student at Boston University, were killed in the blasts. MIT Police officer Sean A. Collier was shot by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev before the brothers fled authorities on the Thursday and Friday after the bombing.
After the tribute, a moment of silence was held at the finish line on Boylston Street. Next Monday, more than 30,000 runners are scheduled to cross that line before a projected one million spectators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After leading the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team to one of its most successful seasons in recent memory, Kevin M. Tyrrell—who served as interim head coach for the 2013-14 season following Tim D. Murphy’s departure last fall—has been named the permanent head coach, Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise announced in a press release Tuesday.
Tyrrell was promoted to interim coach after serving as assistant coach for four seasons. Under his leadership, Harvard captured its 23rd Ivy League Championship and spoiled Princeton’s five-year conference-title streak.
The announcement comes one month after Harvard began a search to fill Murphy’s old position. Patricia Henry, a senior associate director of athletics, led the search group.
In a letter to the Friends of Harvard Swimming and Diving last month, Scalise called Tyrrell “an outstanding internal candidate” but acknowledged the need to assess outside options before coming to a decision.
According to swimmer Griffin T. Schumacher ’15, his teammates hoped that the search committee would make the decision to keep Tyrrell in the position instead of hiring someone unfamiliar with the program.
“I think the whole team really wanted [Tyrrell] to get the job, and none of us are really surprised,” Schumacher said.
Scalise echoed Schumacher’s enthusiasm.
“Along with possessing an in-depth knowledge of the sport of swimming, Kevin [Tyrrell] also cares deeply about his student-athletes' success in academics,” Scalise wrote in the release. “He is a great fit to continue to lead our proud program."
Tyrrell brings 20 years of coaching experience to the Crimson, including stints as a volunteer coach from 2000 to 2004 and an assistant coach from 2009 to 2013, when he was in charge of recruiting potential student-athletes.
Assistant coach Samantha Pitter said that she feels confident that Tyrrell’s extensive experience will be a beneficial factor as the team attempts to go for back-to-back titles next season.
 
“He’s been here for so long that he knows the system well and can support all the other coaches with his knowledge,” said Pitter, who was brought in for the 2013-14 season after Murphy left for the head coach position at Penn State. “He really wants the whole team on the same page, and that includes everyone on the coaching staff.”
In the press release, Tyrrell also expressed excitement to continue his tenure at Harvard.
“I look forward to continuing my work with the team and connecting the generations of Harvard swimmers and divers with each other as we move forward to even greater levels of success," Tyrrell said in the release.

Richard Barth ’89, CEO of KIPP charter schools, will serve as the chief marshal at the University’s Commencement exercises on May 29, the Harvard Alumni Association announced on Tuesday. 
The chief marshal presides over an exclusive luncheon for invited guests on the day of Commencement. Later in the day, wearing a tophat and tails, Barth will lead a University-wide procession of alumni into the Yard for the Afternoon Program.
Barth was chosen from among nine candidates.
“My experience as an undergrad at Harvard was transformative, and opened my eyes to what a college education can do—not only for me, but for others,” Barth said in a press release. “Now, in my work with KIPP, I feel fortunate to be able to contribute toward helping students from our nation’s most underserved communities succeed in college and lead choice-filled lives.”
KIPP is an acronym for Knowledge is Power Program. Its charter schools offer a tuition-free, college preparatory curriculum for students who are accepted. There are 141 KIPP schools nationwide.
HAA selects the chief marshal each year from the Harvard College class celebrating its 25th reunion. Previous chief marshals include Arne S. Duncan '86, Nicholas D. Kristof '81-'82, a former Crimson news editor, and Economics professor Martin S. Feldstein '61.

A proposal before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to convert the College’s current course unit system to a more nationally recognized credit system could lead to an increase in the number and variety of nontraditional course offerings and a University-wide standardization of Harvard’s accreditation system.
 
Currently, the College requires students to take some combination of half- and full-year courses that equal a total of 32 semester-long half-courses. In a proposal brought forth by the Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M.  Harris, a new credit system would dictate that a half-course would be the equivalent of four credits, and a student would be expected to complete 128 total credits by graduation.
Though the system of accreditation will change, students will not be expected to take more than four classes per semester in order to graduate in four years.
“From a practical point of view, students at Harvard College would be substantially unaffected, since they will be required to take the same number of courses as today,” Harris wrote in his proposal.
According to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, talk of converting to the credit system has been going on for the past few decades, though the Faculty Council has only recently approved the proposal, which Harris presented to the Faculty in early April.
If the Faculty votes in favor of the credit system at their next meeting in May, the FAS will implement the new system during the 2015–2016 academic year, in tandem with the rollout of the College’s new Student Information System in the fall of 2015.
Peer institutions like Yale, Columbia, and Cornell each use a credit system already, as do Harvard graduate schools, aside from the Kennedy School and the Divinity School, which currently use the same course unit system as the College. According to Burke, converting to a more nationally recognized system would help students who are applying to graduate schools and jobs, as well those who are reporting to student loan companies.
“We have long stated on the back of our transcript that a half-course is approximately equivalent to four credits,” Burke said. “The purpose of this is that it helps other schools understand what a half-course or a full-course means.”
According to Harris, when the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid reports information to the U.S. Department of Education, it currently converts the College’s course units into credits.
“Our course unit system complicates our ability to meet the reporting requirements, since the government bases its benchmarks and standards on a credit system,” Harris said.
Burke said that the College’s use of course units dates back to at least the 19th century, when most offerings were full-year courses.
“Our current terminology is anachronistic; it’s archaic,” former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68 said. “It stems from a time long ago when most Harvard courses went through two semesters, and that’s why they were called full-courses. Today there are hardly any full-courses.”
Harris also noted in his proposal the possibility of “offering courses that span non-traditional segments of time,” which could include labs, quarter courses, and J-term courses.
While the College already offers a few “less-than half” courses, Harris said the way the course catalogue is currently configured makes it difficult for the College to track these alternative courses.
Many FAS professors said that they viewed the proposal favorably, arguing that students may have a wider and more flexible variety of courses to explore.
“I think from the point of view from our concentration in engineering, this will provide a lot of very useful flexibility,” said Robert D. Howe, the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Biomedical Engineering. “We are forced to try to lump together labs with classes, and sometimes that works well, but with other fields it doesn’t always work.”
Howe noted that if labs could count as a separate class rather than being attached to regular lectures or sections, students may be able to choose labs that are more tailored toward their interests.
“The benefit is that we can sort things out into nicer, more logical pieces,” Howe said.
However, Howe warned against increasing the amount of work students would be expected to complete under this new system.
“Every time you have a new class, there’s another layer of overhead,” he said. “It’s one more place you have to go at regular time every week, so we have to be careful that in splitting things up into nice digestible pieces, we don't increase the workload for both faculty and students.”
Lewis, who is a professor of computer science, added, “Certainly, we here in computer science and engineering can think of ways to be creative with these courses.”
Though both Burke and Harris emphasized that there would be no curricular or pedagogical change for undergraduates, they noted that administrative processes would be made easier, especially with the launch of the Student Information System, which will allow students from across all 12 Harvard schools to complete tasks ranging from study card submissions to billing payments all on one online platform.
 
Harris said that the Student Information System will come “ready made” for the course credit system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: April 16, 2014, at 2:28 p.m.
This is the second in a weeklong series of articles chronicling Harvard’s remembrance of the Boston Marathon Bombings that occured a year ago.
One year after emergency workers and medical personnel rushed to the finish line of the Boston Marathon to attend to the hundreds of runners and spectators at the site of the bombings, the Countway Library of Medicine is continuing its efforts to expand “Strong Medicine,” a digital archive that captures and compiles the stories of the bombing's emergency responders.
 
Originally conceived in the summer of 2013, the archive was made available to the public earlier in the spring, according to Scott H. Podolsky, director of the Center for the History of Medicine, a set of collections at Countway that hosts the archive.
 
The archive commemorates the efforts of hospital administrators, doctors, and emergency workers who mobilized in the wake of the fatal, unprecedented bombings, which injured hundreds and killed three. In addition, by centralizing narratives and information regarding Boston’s emergency response, the creators of the archive said that they hope that it will serve as a resource for historians and doctors alike.
 
Currently, the archive contains more than 30 oral histories of surgeons, hospital administrators, and directors of emergency departments who were involved in the emergency response, which many doctors and commentators have since lauded. The collection also includes several commemorative cards and posters that were created in the wake of the bombing.
 
“I think it’s really important to collect history as it’s happening so that people still remember the smaller details about what they were doing last year,” said Joan Ilacqua, the "Strong Medicine" project coordinator. “What we really want to do is make sure that we have a permanent record of that moment in Boston.”
Under the leadership of Ilacqua, four Boston-area graduate students have helped to collect materials and expand the archive.
One of these students, Miriam Rich, who has been interviewing medical professionals for the archive, said that the collection can serve both the general public and medical officials.
“[The archive] will help people appreciate and understand the level of coordination between different people and teams and institutions that need to work together in order for such a successful response to an emergency to happen,” said Rich, a graduate student in Harvard’s History of Science Department. “We can continue to repeat and improve on such a successful emergency response protocol.”
Similarly, Podolsky said that the archive represents an opportunity not only for remembrance but also for reflection on the quality of emergency response.
According to Podolsky, Countway was chosen as the location of the archive because it represents a partnership between the Boston Medical Library and Harvard Medical School. He said this collaboration has facilitated the collection of oral histories from hospitals and medical institutions across Boston.
Even though the archive has been open to the public for over a month, “Strong Medicine” is an ongoing project. Ilacqua said that she has been reaching out to institutions and individuals in an effort to collect stories and objects that reflect the response to the bombings.
“We’re still actively looking for people to give us their stories,” she said.
According to Rich, the project coordinators are seeking to expand the archive as to include the voices of people in non-leadership positions, like nurses and law enforcement personnel.
Emily Harrison '02, another graduate student in the History of Science Department who contributed to the project, said that the process of developing the archive not only provides an opportunity for future research but also offers a chance for reflection for both the Boston community and the archivists themselves.
“I think that the act of creating the archive is also an act of remembering and community-building,” she said. “It feels like a great privilege to get to work on this project and to talk with people who are so very open sharing their stories.”

CORRECTION: April 9, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the department in which Miriam Rich and Emily Harrison are graduate students. In fact, they are in the History of Science Department.

Harvard researchers recently published the results of a long-term study showing that watching greater amounts of television is associated with lesser amounts of sleep for children in their infancy and middle childhood.
 
The investigators found 1,864 children between the ages of six months and eight years to participate in the study through Project Viva, an initiative created in the mid-1990s to help understand a child’s health before or around the time of birth.
“The most exciting part of the study is the longitudinal aspect, showing that these associations start early in life, [and it’s] best to prevent them before behaviors and physiology take hold,” said Matthew W. Gillman ‘76, the principal investigator of Project Viva, an advisor to the other authors of this study, and a professor at Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute, and Harvard School of Public Health.
The co-authors of the television-sleep study, Elizabeth M. Cespedes, Ken P. Kleinman, Shreyl L. Rifas-Shiman, Susan Redline and Elsie M. Taveras, work across HMS, HPHCI, HSPH, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital for Children.
 
Taveras met Gillman in the early 2000s, and after finding that they had many mutual interests, Gillman and Taveras worked side by side for more than 10 years. Taveras and Gillman also worked with Cespedes, a student at Harvard School of Public Health, on the study. The remaining authors had been involved in Project Viva.
 
“We and others had looked at sleep and television screen time as independent risk factors for child obesity,” Gillman said. “Here we took it a step further by asking, could one of the reasons that more screen time is related to obesity be that it reduces sleep, which itself appears to cause excess weight gain?”
 
The team worked together to collect annual data from Project Viva and were careful to make sure the association they found between television-viewing and sleep amounts was independent of a child’s age, race/ethnicity, gender, income, or maternal education.
 
The results of the study showed that, as hypothesized, a greater amount of television screen time may decrease sleeping time. For example, adding one hour of television time daily is associated with a decrease in sleep time of approximately seven minutes.
The presence of a bedroom television was shown to also potentially decrease sleep time, especially in children of racial or ethnic minorities, as it was associated with a 31 minute decrease in sleep for those subjects in comparison with an eight minute decrease in sleep for white, non-Hispanic children.
 
According to Gillman, “We’ve got a generation of kids whose screen time can veer out of control. One of the adverse health consequences is poorer sleep.”
In order to prevent the consequences of weight gain, lowered mood, and school performance associated with less sleep, the investigators hope to launch interventions based on the results from their study.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Princeton Invitational this weekend, the Harvard men’s golf team built an early seven-stroke lead over rival Yale and never looked back. The Crimson finished first out of 15 teams, earning its first victory of the season and its best performance at the Invitational since 2009.
“Golf is played over multiple days, and multiple rounds, and multiple hours,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “At any one time when things are going well, it’s easy to start projecting forward and getting ahead of yourself and thinking about possibly winning the tournament. We did a very good job of not doing that. There were a number of moments when we were able to just stay present and not look back or look ahead.”
This especially held true for the Crimson after the first six holes of the final round on Sunday. Harvard did not execute as well as it had in the first two rounds, and the team saw its 14-stroke lead over the Bulldogs start to slip.
But the Crimson refocused and returned to form, closing out the final round with a tournament total of 832 strokes. With four top-ten finishers, Harvard finished three strokes ahead of Yale, ending the Bulldogs’ quest for a fourth straight Princeton Invitational Championship.
Harvard junior Akash Mirchandani paced the 78-player field, shooting eight under par over the course of the weekend. The junior entered the final round with a three-stroke cushion after shooting nine under on Saturday. Then, Mirchandani held off a pair of freshmen, teammate Robert Deng and Dartmouth’s Jeffrey Lang, in the third round to finish first overall by a single stroke.
For Deng, the tournament marked the freshman’s best finish with the Crimson thus far, as he improved on his six-under performance Saturday to finish seven under par, tying for second.
The performances from Mirchandani and Deng were just enough to edge Yale, who had three top-ten finishers, but none within the top three.
The depth of the Harvard squad gave it the edge. Freshman Daniel De La Garza and captain Theo Lederhausen rounded out the top-ten finishers for the Crimson. The freshman shot a first-round 68, besting Lederhausen by one stroke, before the two went stroke-for-stroke, each shooting for par in the final two rounds. In the competitive field, the one-stroke difference between the pair left De La Garza in a four-way tie for sixth place and Lederhausen tied for tenth.
“Our lineup is constantly changing,” Mirchandani said. “The players that travel and play in each tournament changes week to week. And that’s just a reflection of how deep our team is. Any week, any player on our team can shoot the best score and that’s really fun to be a part of.”
The first-place finish put Harvard atop the Ancient Eight at the tournament, as every Ivy League school was represented at the competition. Aside from Yale, the Crimson finished 22 strokes ahead of third-place Dartmouth and more than 30 strokes in front of fourth-place Columbia.
But Rhoads warns that this doesn’t necessarily mean anything for the Ivy League Championships in two weeks.
“[This performance] simply means that our skill sets are continuing to improve, and we need to feel confident and feel good about those,” Rhoads said. “[If we] keep working hard on that stuff in the next couple of weeks, that will make the results take care of themselves.”

The Harvard softball team (21-11, 7-0 Ivy) is playing in a league of its own right now. The Crimson has won 12 straight contests and is playing with the utmost confidence.
What has been the secret to Harvard’s recent success? Look no further than junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone.
Named to the second team All-Ivy in her sophomore campaign, Ricciardone has pitched at an even higher level in 2014. The Slidel, La., native is 11-5 in the circle this year and has posted a team best 1.90 ERA.
Ricciardone has the fourth-lowest ERA in the Ivy League, has totaled the second-most wins, and ranks fourth in total strikeouts. She has been named Ivy League Pitcher of the Week three times already, the most recent of which followed wins over Boston College and Penn.
“Laura is strong for us,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She comes in and attacks batters, has command of all her pitches, and really stepped up to win those games.”
This past week, Ricciardone continued her dominance.
Facing Columbia in the first contest of a double-header, Ricciardone pitched a complete game and allowed no earned runs. In seven innings, Ricciardone gave up only six hits, while striking out seven batters to help Harvard remain unbeaten in the Ancient Eight.
“It was a strong outing for our team and the conclusion of our southern division tour,” Ricciardone said. “We really wanted to come away with two wins, and [it was] important that we didn’t drop any games in that division. We wanted to finish our pseudo-opening weekend with two wins, and we were able to go out and do that.”
Ricciardone then faced the University of Rhode Island in a mid-week matchup, albeit limiting her innings due to the heavy pitching load.
“We wanted to get the whole staff pitching time,” Ricciardone said. “Our offense produced enough runs so that we could do that, and defense was solid.”
Nonetheless, the junior did not let the limited numbers of batters she would face deter her from putting on another clinic. In the three frames she pitched, Ricciardone gave up only two hits, struck out two batters, and allowed zero runs.
But that wasn’t even the biggest highlight from the junior’s outing. In the top of the second, with the game scoreless, Ricciardone belted a two-run home run, the first of her career, to help secure the 5-1 win over the Rams.
“I didn’t practice hitting at the beginning of the season, but [I] picked it up at the end of our California trip,” Ricciardone said. “I had been not hitting to focus on the pitching, but now that I am healthy, I am happy to have it back as part of my game.”
Allard’s decision to rest Ricciardone was certainly a prudent one. Only two days later, Ricciardone pitched 11 innings in less than 48 hours.
In the first of four games against Brown, Ricciardone pitched a complete game. In seven innings, she gave up only one run on four hits while striking out six batters to earn the 4-1 win.
Ricciardone’s bat refused to cool off. A single to left field resulted in her third RBI of the week, and the junior added another the following day. Since returning from the team spring trip to California, Ricciardone has six hits and six RBIs.
“I give the credit to her,” Allard said. “She came to coaches and asked to hit…. The team was struggling at times, and she came to us asking if she could swing the bat.”
The following day, Ricciardone took the circle for the fourth time that week. While most pitchers would be tired from already pitching 17 innings over the past few days, the junior didn’t miss a beat.
“The Brown series is always difficult,” Ricciardone said. “It’s taxing to face the same hitters over and over again, so you need to really have command of your pitches and a solid defense behind you to rely on.”
It would take Ricciardone only 17 batters to make it through her four assigned innings. She allowed only five base runners on the afternoon, while giving up no runs on the day.
“She commanded her pitchers and attacked their weakness,” said Allard. “She was phenomenal…. She has really been stepping up for us this year, and there is no question.”
The last time Ricciardone lost a game was March 21, and if she keeps pitching like this, she does not look poised to lose anytime soon.

It was divide and conquer for the No. 14 Harvard coed sailing team this weekend, as the Crimson spread out all over the New England area to compete in four regattas. The team came out on top of many familiar opponents and earned three top-five finishes on the weekend.
“We were pretty happy with the way we were sailing,” junior skipper Brian Drumm said. “Especially given that . . . this is our first weekend of fleet racing regattas.”
On Saturday and Sunday, the team competed at the two-division Savin Hill Invitational which was hosted by Boston College and held on Dorchester Bay. Both Harvard squads turned in solid performances to earn an overall third-place finish in the field of seven teams.
Freshman skipper David Mende and crew Nomin-Erden Jagdagdorj guided the A boat to seven top-five finishes, and sophomore skipper Adam Brodehim teamed up with freshman Victor Kamenker to nab three top-three times. The Crimson would end with 160 total points.
A dominating performance from Boston College put the lead out of the Crimson’s reach as the Eagles cruised to first-place with just 54 points.
Meanwhile, other Harvard sailors were racing on the Thames River in a two-division regatta for the Owen, Mosbacher and Knapp Trophies.
“That’s a great benefit of being in the New England area,” Drumm said. “There are a lot of these regattas that are hosted every weekend, so a lot of our sailors are able to get a lot of sailing time.”
The A division squad for the Crimson consisted of sophomore skipper Andrew Mollerus with freshman Sydney Karnovsky and senior Luke O’Connor as crew. They would end the competition with 137 points and in 11th place among the 17 competitors in their division. The B squad fared well, as junior Michael Drumm and senior Isabel Ruane paired up as skipper and crew, respectively, to earn sixth place in their division with a solid 81 points.
Host team Yale would go on to carry the contest with an overall score of 80.
The Thames was also the site of the 27th Thompson Trophy. Beautiful race conditions allowed the intersectional regatta to go off without a hitch, and Harvard would sail to its second third-place finish of the weekend with a total of 243. A strong performance from Drumm along with Ashleigh Inglis at crew would lead the way for the Crimson, as the duo grabbed third-place overall in the A division.
“I’ve never sailed with [Inglis] in competition before,” Drumm said. “So we went out Saturday morning before the competition and really worked on how we work together in the boat, because a lot of sailing is really fast-paced action …. It worked out very well.”
The C division, staffed by sophomore skipper Marek Zaleski and freshman crew Emma Wheeler, came out of the gates strong, turning in a stellar day-one performance that would leave them just one point behind division-leader South Florida heading into Sunday. They were able to keep that pace through day-two as well, putting up an impressively low 46 points for the event.
Junior skipper Gram Slattery and freshman crew Olivia Krorlien rounded out Harvard’s lineup with a 14th-place finish in the B division. First place would go to the top-ranked Stanford team, as the Cardinal finished the day with a combined 173 points.
Rounding out the weekend action, MIT hosted a 13-school race for the 70th Greater Boston Oberg Trophy. This in-conference regatta brought out a plethora of regional teams familiar to the Crimson. A first-place finish in the 12th race propelled freshmen Juan Carlos Perdomo and Priscilla Russo, skipper and crew, to a fourth-place finish in the A division. The B division boat for Harvard, which was manned by senior skipper Caitlin Watson and sophomore crew Kristina Jakobson, managed to secure three first-place races to a seventh-place ranking in their division.
Freshman skipper Bennett Capozzi and junior crew Rebecca Frankel turned out similar results in the C division with one victory and six top-five finishes slotting them at fifth best in that class.
The Crimson would place fifth with 220 points, while the Engineers walked away with 183 points and the win.
Harvard will follow up this flurry of races with five more next weekend.
“We’re definitely focused on what our own boat is doing,” Drumm said. “We’re just need to make sure that we make as few mistakes as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The elements were not ideal for golf this weekend in Providence, R.I. Steady winds of roughly 30 mph made for difficult scoring conditions at Metacoment Country Club.
But the weather did not deter the Harvard women’s golf team, as the Crimson won the Brown BEAR Invitational with an overall score of 628, 20 shots ahead of second-place Boston University.
“I think the team played amazing,” captain Bonnie Hu said. “The conditions were really tough, the winds got up to 40 mph, and playing with that amount of wind is not the easiest thing to do. People did a really good job focusing on the things that they could control and not letting things like the wind affect them.”
Crimson junior Tiffany Lim led the way for Harvard and took home the individual title. Lim, who had one other individual victory earlier this season at the Princeton Invitational, posted a two-over-par 73 on Sunday to take the overnight lead. The junior shot 79 on Monday for a four-shot victory.
“The team did really well today controlling emotions, because conditions were really tough,” Lim said. “The winds were 30-40 miles per hour, and the greens were firm. It was a day that we could have easily gotten frustrated, but we were able to pull it together and make a good run.”
Three other Harvard players finished in the top 10, and all finished in the top 20.
Playing as an individual, junior Brenna Nelsen finished in a tie for second place with a two-day total of 156. Nelsen, a Crimson sports executive, fired a 77 on Sunday followed by a final-round 79.
Sophomore Courtney Hooton shot a combined 158 through the two days of play, landing her tied for fourth with Dartmouth’s Jane Lee and BU’s Kristyna Pavlickova. Pavlickova carded the lowest score of Monday’s round, shooting a five-over-par 76.
Sophomore Christine Lin and freshman Anne Cheng each ended the tournament tied for seventh at 160. Lin shaved five shots off her Sunday score with a team-best 77 on Monday.
First-year Nina Fairbairn posted rounds of 81 and 82 for the Crimson to finish in a tie for 13th place.
After the first round, the Crimson found itself at the top of the leaderboard with an overall 310 through the first 18 holes of the tournament. While the winds continued to pick up in Monday’s final round, the team found success during the final day of play, carding a 318, the lowest team score on the day.
“I think that the common theme throughout this season has been focus,” Hu said. “Whenever we play or practice, we really go through it as a process and that comes in especially handy when you are playing in really tough conditions.”
“I think a lot of [our success comes from] preparation,” Lim said. “We have put in a lot of work since spring break, and we came into this [tournament] knowing whatever happened out on the field, we just had to put our best game forward given what the conditions were. We’ve been focusing on the process on the course, which really helped us.”
Rounding out play for the Crimson was Hu, who also competed as an individual for Harvard. The senior finished tied for nineteenth with an overall score of 166, carding rounds of 81 and 85 for the tournament.
The Brown Invitational was the team’s last competition before Ivy Championships on April 25.
“Going into Ivies I think we are feeling pretty confident as a team,” Hu said. “We always feel pretty confident, because we are really good at doing us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team swept Brown this weekend, keeping pace with Dartmouth to remain undefeated in the Ivy League.
The homestanding Crimson (21-11, 7-0 Ivy) did not trail once over four games against a struggling Bears squad (2-26, 0-12).
“It's a great feeling to be undefeated so far, but we know there is still a lot of work to be done,” captain Kasey Lange said.
Harvard 5, Brown 2
Harvard hit three home runs for five runs off three different bats en route to a clean win over the Bears.
The Crimson got off to an early four-run lead thanks to back-to-back innings with two-run homers, one from Lange in the first, her fifth of the season, and one from junior Adrienne Hume the next inning.  Junior Emily Gusse also added a solo shot in the Sixth inning.
“It was great for us to show a lot of power this weekend,” Lange said. “It definitely reflects the versatility of our offense. We have a little bit of everything going for us.”
Sophomore pitcher Morgan Groom started the game for Harvard, posting two perfect innings and striking out three to pick up her third win of the season. Freshman Taylor Cabe came in for a five-inning relief stint, giving up two runs on five hits.
The weekend sweep keeps Harvard undefeated in Ivy League play. The Crimson still trails Dartmouth, which has contested more games on its way to a 12-0 start.
“This weekend was important in the Ivy League race, like every weekend is,” Groom said. “Looking forward, we just need to stay with our process and execute. We play best when we're loose and having a good time, so if we do those things, we'll continue to do well.”
Harvard 6, Brown 4
The Crimson came out of the gate strong, posting six runs over the first two innings and then cruising the rest of the way to its first win of Sunday. Sloppy play led to runs for Brown late, but Harvard was able to do just enough to hold on.
Junior Katherine Lantz blasted a three-run home run in the first to put the Crimson ahead early. A barrage of doubles in the second gave Harvard three more unearned runs to put them in front six runs.
“Lantz had a stellar weekend,” Groom said. “She hit great and pounded a home run and made stellar plays on defense.”
Junior Laura Ricciardone took the mound for the Crimson, posting four scoreless innings for her 11th win of the season. Junior reliever Gabrielle Ruiz allowed four runs as the Bears clawed back into the game late, yet only one of those runs was earned.
Harvard 4, Brown 0
Cabe tossed a complete game shut out as the Crimson won the nightcap of the first doubleheader of the weekend against Brown. The win gave Crimson a Saturday sweep, its first of the Ivy League season.
Gusse belted a triple in the bottom of the third to put the Crimson in front two runs and Ricciardone, helping out on the offense end instead of on the mound, tacked on another run with an RBI single to push Gusse across the plate.
Cabe struck out ten and only walked one in a dominant performance. It was her fifth win of the season and fourth complete game.
Harvard 4, Brown 1
Harvard jumped out to an early lead to give Ricciardone a lead that she never relinquished, pitching a one-run complete game for her 10th win of the season.
In its first offensive frame of the weekend, the Crimson posted five singles to drive in three runs, one with the help of an illegal pitch from Brown’s Leah Nakashima and one from Lange, who is second in the Ivy League with 24 on the season.
The next frame, captain Shelbi Olson added a run on a fielder’s choice to augment the Crimson advantage.
In the bottom of the sixth, with Brown threating to score another run, Ricciardone struck out Brown’s Kelsey Williams. The junior Harvard pitcher allowed only three runners to reach scoring position.
Ricciardone labored, throwing 135 pitches, but exercised control, limiting the Bears to four hits and striking out six. The win put her at 10 on the season and stands second in the Ivy League in both wins and ERA.

Welcome back to Listen Up! Your trusted Flyby advisers—two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting sophomores—are back with the latest advice and invaluable counsel.
Over the past several weeks, we have received numerous inquiries as to whether the questions we answer are actually real. Let us assure you, just as with each and every post, all of the questions we publish are very, very real. Honestly, if you’ve read our responses, you know we are nowhere near clever enough to come up with answers that are as funny and insightful as your questions.
We have received hundreds of submissions, and only the best of the best make it onto the post every week. If you think you have what it takes, don’t forget to submit your questions here or on the Googleform at the end of the post. Come on, we know you’re troubled.  
Does sex in Widener count if it’s just with myself?
Excuse us, what? We knew some of you out there was desperate to finish the three things but not this desperate. 
We suppose that if that fits your definition of sex, then it can personally count as your fulfilment of sex in the stacks. But part of the point of these acts is that you can brag your entire life that you had the guts (or balls, if you will) to have sex in a library, participate in Primal Scream, and provide tourists with a wet foot to rub. 
 
It’s definitely not as cool if you replace sex with self-pleasure. In fact, you go from sounding like an awesome college kid to sounding like an indecent threat to society.
 
For all our sakes, we just hope you don’t work at the circulation desk. 
 
There’s this guy who I’ve been crushing on, and he’s perfect but I don’t think he knows I exist. How do I get Dean Pfister’s attention??
It’s always tough to catch the eyes of those celebrities who make your heart beat a little faster. We know first-hand: Emma Watson hasn’t returned any of our fan mail. (In fact, we send her an additional piece of fan mail every Listen Up! submission we get. All the more reason to ask us questions).
 
But after some truly groundbreaking research, we have one strategy for your courtship of Dean Pfister that may prove useful: fungus. While this may be a deterrent to most men, it might be just the smelly, weird mushroom-shaped key to Pfister’s heart. First step, buy a high-quality mushroom costume (it HAS to be high-quality or else he might discover your ruse too quickly.) Second, position yourself at the heart of Harvard Yard on a tree near the not-actually John Harvard statue. We have on good authority that the Dean’s window faces that direction! Now, just wait patiently until he approaches you. After that, it’s all up to you.
 

 What is the best way to play it cool when you accidentally fart really loudly in the library? 
Your first response should always be to stare at the person closest to you and give them a face. What face, you ask? This face. The same one you give to that guy who takes the last spoonful of tomato basil soup in the dhall. One glaring, confident stare is all it takes to convert a little digestive hiccup into a socially domineering position.
 
Whenever I shower in our bathroom, I always hear the people next door having very loud sex in their shower, which shares a wall with ours. It’s pretty gross, and I would tell them to be quieter, but they are my tutors. How do I get out of their sex life? 
There is one clear solution to this problem: have sex in your own shower—just louder. This allows you to bring up the issue with the tutor when they come around complaining about you. At a bare minimum, you can help drown out the noise. Plus, there’s the added benefit that you’re having sex.
 
If that option is not available to you in your current romantic situation, we here at Listen Up! encourage you to rely on that most sacred of shower traditions: singing. Whether you’re star of the Opportunes or just a star to your mother, here’s your chance to exercise those vocal chords. Choose between one of these three songs, and you’ll be sure to get the effect you want.
 
1. Make sure you sing the intro.2. Tap into your inner Olivia Newton-John. 3. And of course, no playlist would be complete without a little Britney.
 
If worst comes to worst and your beautiful singing fails, you can always approach your tutors and tell them to register their “party.” After all, they should be held to the same standards as us, right?
 
Dear Dev and Steve,There is a guy that I like in the year above me. We've worked together and get along well but aren't really friends. How do I increase my social contact with him without being too forward or seeming like a naive freshman girl?Sincerely,Lovesick in Lionel
Dear Ms. Lovesick,
 
Since you had the decency to write to us formally, we’ll give you a lengthy response.
 
We have to come clean. We’ve been incredibly helpful in answering our readers’ questions. We’ve answered 26 questions, each with careful thought and consideration. Our expertise really has run the gamut from questions regarding best shampoos to questions about how to solve complex math concepts. However, what you ask us is actually beyond our shared knowledge. Oh don’t get us wrong, it’s not because we’re bad at what we do. It’s actually because we’re super awesome.
 
You see, the concept of flirting—which essentially is what you want help with—doesn’t really exist in our universe. You’ve seen our photos (yes, the people featured at the top of every post are not models hired by Flyby but actual photos of us), we don’t need to spend months, weeks, even days, in the courtship process. Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for you), the sparks fly immediately. By the time Dev is ten minutes into a conversation with a girl, he’s already secured the time and location of the second date. Steven’s a bit slower, clockin’ in at fifteen minutes, but he’s getting better.
 
That’s not to say we’re refusing to answer this question. We've spent hours pouring over web resources and compiled the best advice for you. The best website we found in terms of help in this area is wikiHow. It’s a less comprehensive version of this column, but it’ll do. WikiHow recommends that you “give a little wave” when you leave his presence. “When he reciprocates, you’ll know you have his attention.” Another article says that the next time you work together, you should raise your eyebrows a little bit, push your tongue down against the bottom of your mouth, and make eye contact, but only to quickly look away and continue on with your work as if nothing happened. Apparently “this keeps him wanting more.”
 
Does that help? We’re really sorry that we couldn’t directly help you in increasing your social contact with this guy.
 
Best of luck!
 
Sincerely,
Steven and Dev

Stephen Colbert will be taking over the Late Show when David Letterman retires, which means only one thing: more publicity for Harvard. Colbert’s secret yearning to attend Harvard College remains alive and well, manifesting itself as a bit of an obsession. Here are some highlights of the times he’s mentioned his dream school on "The Colbert Report":
 
1. Walmart is harder to get into than Harvard (December 10, 2013) 
It came as a surprise to many Americans as Colbert alerted the public that the acceptance rate for Walmart employees is lower than Harvard's. It turns out Walmart’s common app essay isn’t optional.
2. Professor Daniel Lieberman chats about booties (May 17, 2013)
Baby, apparently, got back. Professor Daniel Lieberman, barefoot running expert, discusses the unique features of the human body, one of which being Colbert's "big, incredible butt," that make us great runners. Sir Mix-a-lot would be proud.
3. Gilbert Offers Colbert a Job (June 27, 2007)
Daniel Gilbert, professor of psychology, concludes that Colbert could teach at Harvard. If he would just show up 5 times a semester, he’d have a better track record than a certain Ec10 professor. Colbert already has his own textbook anyways.
4. David Keith Temporarily Saves the World (December 9, 2013)
Pssst.. Al Gore, the truth isn’t always inconvenient. Harvard scientist David Keith claims spraying sulfuric acid into the atmosphere could temporarily stop global warming on "The Colbert Report". That sounds like a healthy plan, right?
5. May the Odds Be Ever in Sandel’s Favor (July 20, 2011)
Together, Professor Michael J. Sandel and Colbert grapple with the idea of fairness in terms of politics, ethics, and ultimately, cannibalism. Let the hunger games begin.

 There is a pivotal moment in every Harvard senior’s final semester when they reflect on their four years at Harvard and try to figure out the best way to commemorate the good memories.
Should they write an op-ed in The Crimson? Pick up the camera and document every second of their last month here? Dig a tunnel from their new home to their House so they can always go back if a bout of homesickness arises?
How about taking a page from Jill E. Abramson’s book? One of our most esteemed alums, Abramson ‘76 currently serves as executive editor of The New York Times. She was number five (!) on the 2012 Forbes Magazine’s List of the World’s 100 Most Powerful Women and, oh, she casually has a tattoo of the Crimson Harvard “H.”
In an interview for Out magazine, Abramson explained her reasoning for the “H” as well as for her New York Times “T”. She stated, “I have two then on my back that are the two institutions that I revere, that have shaped me.”
Harvard Seniors: It’s time to think about your ink!
