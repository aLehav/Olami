After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
There inevitably comes a point in studying where you become absolutely sick of every song in your iTunes library and can no longer stand the commercials about One Direction that keep popping up every Pandora playlist. For those dark moments, Flyby has a list of songs to keep you going through the last stretch of finals period.
1. "Cycling Trivialities" by José González
This mellow song, spanning nine minutes and 20 seconds, will most certainly calm you down about your finals. So what if that three hour physics exam counts for half of the grade? Just spend a few minutes listening to the same guitar progression as José asks you "who cares a hundred years from now?" Guaranteed to auditorily soothe.
 
2. "Peace Train" by Cat Stevens 
No matter how much studying there is to do, this song make it all better by prompting everyone to "join the peace train."
 
3. "Bulletproof" by La Roux 
So what if you bombed that last paper and your TF's comments made you tear up a little? La Roux will help you be "bulletproof" so that you can live to see New Year's Eve. 
 
4. "Float On" by Modest Mouse
The ultimate YOLO song since before Drake was even a thing. If Isaac Brock can get away with all of that and still "float" along, you can make it through your all-nighter. 
 
5. "The Distance" by Cake 
This prolific 90s band provides the best pump-up song to listen to when that fifth cup of coffee doesn't cut it anymore. 
 
6. "Seven Nation Army" by The White Stripes 
The now-defunct duo of Jack and Meg White made some pretty great bass and drum numbers with beats steady enough to keep you awake and focused on reaching that minimum word count. Beware: This music video borders on hypnotic. 
 
7. "Once in A Lifetime" by Talking Heads 
College happens only once in a lifetime—so why stress over one exams period? Listen to David Byrne and "let the days go by."
 
8. "That Time" by Regina Spektor
Regina Spektor sure has done some crazy things in her life, so why not live vicariously through her song from your isolated enclave in Lamont? Warning: may or may not induce cravings of tangerines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time, in a not-so-faraway Yard, there lived a young woman in search of a concentration where she could best express her passions. She had ventured to Harvard in pursuit of an English concentration, but she soon had a change of heart.
After taking a class her freshman year on fantasy literature with folklore and mythology professor Maria Tatar, Rebecca T. Harbeson ’13 fell in love with the idea of studying fairy tales. She decided that concentrating in folklore and mythology would lead to a happier ever after.
Three years later, Harbeson is now writing a young adult novel as a final senior project.
“I realized that writing a research thesis was not necessarily the one thing I wanted to get out of my undergraduate career,” she says. “Writing a novel has always been something I really wanted to do.”
Folklore and mythology recently joined English; literature; studies of women, gender, and sexuality; and visual and environmental studies in offering some concentrators the option of working on a creative project as a senior thesis.
Harbeson, one of the two current seniors pursuing folklore and mythology as a primary concentration, is among the first to take advantage of the new creative option, which is a stand-alone thesis alternative for the first time this year.
Still in its pilot stages, the creative project offers new ways for students to demonstrate their mastery of the field, says Deborah D. Foster, the director of undergraduate studies for folklore and mythology. But faculty and students are still looking for ways to improve the evaluation and mentorship components of the creative option.
A NOVEL APPROACH
The decision to allow students to pursue a creative project in place of a traditional thesis did not come easily. Evaluating an artistic form of expression in the context of an academic institution can be a challenge, Foster says.
“Our faculty do not necessarily have the level of expertise in a particular artistic form to evaluate these projects fairly,” she says. “We need to rely on the project adviser who has some expertise in the particular form the student has chosen to give him or her a grade.”
Because of this difficulty in finding qualified advisers and evaluators, creative theses can only be awarded cum laude honors, whereas traditional senior theses may be awarded cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude, Foster says.
Tatar, who chairs the Standing Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, says that the written rationale by the students that accompanies their creative projects helps graders better evaluate them. The committee relies on faculty from the anthropology, English, and VES departments to assist in the evaluations, a system that Tatar says has worked well.
Harbeson says she feels that she has not received as much support for her project as some of her peers who are working on traditional theses. For instance, she cannot go to a senior thesis support group for advice because they are set up to help students writing research theses.
“It’s just me and my adviser,” she says. “I’m begging all my roommates to read my novel so that they can give me feedback.”
In light of the challenges of pursuing a creative thesis, the approval process is designed to make sure that students have enough previous experience in their chosen form to carry out the project, Foster says.
In order for a creative thesis proposal to be approved, the student needs to show that they are familiar with the art form they intend to use, Foster says. Harbeson says she took creative writing classes which prepared her to write her novel.
WORDS AND PICTURES
Harbeson’s plan is to submit a 100-page young adult novel, a rewriting of the fairy tale “Rumpelstiltskin” by the Brothers Grimm, by the mid-March deadline. Her creative thesis allows her to engage with an issue that has been a central part of her life.
“I’m writing as if the queen hadn’t been able to guess Rumpelstiltskin’s name—as if he had kept the child he had been promised,” she says. “The reason why I’m doing this is that fairy tales have an emphasis on the biological family being the only family who can really raise a child.”
As an adopted daughter, Harbeson says that she has a problem with the original tale’s portrayal of biological ties as a necessary component for the ideal family, so she decided to explore the idea of Rumpelstiltskin being able to raise the queen’s daughter on his own.
Devi K. Lockwood ’14, another folklore and mythology student, is also planning on taking advantage of the creative project option, which she says was the deciding factor in choosing her concentration. Her thesis will be a collection of poems that use water as a metaphor for storytelling.
“Water is really central and important to my life because I’m a rower and my mom was a lifeguard, so I’ve just grown up in and around all different kinds of water,” she says. “I’m interested in exploring how water is the unifying factor for different people who live in an area.”
Last spring, Meredith H. Keffer ’12, a former Crimson photo editor, presented a collection of photographs as part of her senior thesis on the worship of folk saints in Argentina.
Before the non-academic thesis option was officially made available to folklore and mythology concentrators, students like Keffer who wanted to do a creative project would include that component alongside their analytical theses. Foster says that this trend contributed to the decision to allow seniors to submit only the creative part.
Keffer’s 166-page thesis, which was about three-quarters photographs, received the Swapna Dev Prize, an award that recognizes excellent senior projects in folklore and mythology, as well as a Hoopes Prize.
“Having a creative option gives students an opportunity to engage those other senses, to think and work outside of the narrow academic box, and also to try to convey knowledge in a more engaging way,” Keffer says.
KALEIDOSCOPE EYES
Tatar calls folklore and mythology a “kaleidoscopic concentration” because of the variety of creative media it can include. “We’re living in a multidisciplinary academic world and in a multimedia environment, where knowledge is transmitted now through visual and print culture,” she says.
For this concentration, a creative thesis is a good fit, Keffer opines. “You have to open yourself to a certain degree of creativity in order to study other cultures,” she says, adding that folklore is often defined precisely as the study of expressive culture.
Foster, however, notes that the term “creative” may be a problematic label for the artistic option, since it implies that the traditional thesis is something other than creative.
Lockwood agrees, “Writing an analytical thesis is just engaging in a different kind of creativity.”
Folklore and mythology concentrators say that they appreciate how responsive the Committee has been to their special interests. “It’s brilliant for people like me, because I struggle a lot with paper writing and the idea of writing a thesis was incredibly intimidating to me,” Harbeson says. “I wouldn’t have enjoyed it.”
“It’s a department where you’re not anonymous in any way,” says Lockwood. “Your intellectual interests can mix up with your personal life in the best possible way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Dec. 18, 2012, at 8:08 p.m.
When Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died last year, Cantabrigians gathered on Main Street in Kendall Square to mourn the passing of a tech industry god.
They stood near Jobs’ plaque on the Entrepreneurial Walk of Fame, where they laid flowers on the star bearing his name. The Entrepreneurial Walk of Fame had opened that year to honor and celebrate big names in business, and Kendall now seemed a place to go to honor an innovator.
“We want to be the head of innovation and entrepreneurship—what Wall Street has for finance and what Hollywood has for celebrities,” said Travis McCready, executive director of the Kendall Square Association, a board of community stakeholders.
Since its bygone days as a home to manufacturing factories, Kendall Square has become a magnet for the global information technology, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries, drawing companies like Google, Microsoft, and Pfizer. Also home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it has been called the most innovative square mile on Earth by the Boston Consulting Group.
Once a post-industrial wasteland, the now-vibrant Kendall area could provide a model for Harvard as it reboots plans to transform the underdeveloped Allston neighborhood just across the Charles River into the University’s research hub.
WASTELAND TO WONDERLAND
Fifty years ago, Kendall Square—today a key driver of Cambridge’s economy—was empty.
Manufacturing companies had moved out to make room for NASA’s new Electronic Research Center, which was expected to reinvigorate Kendall Square, according to Charles M. Sullivan of the Cambridge Historical Commission.
But President Lyndon B. Johnson thwarted this dream of revival, deciding instead to locate NASA’s new facilities in his home state of Texas.
The ensuing decades were sleepy ones for Kendall. But the construction of several office buildings in the 1990s at last triggered an explosion of development that has continued to this day.
Jeff Lockwood, the global head of communications at Novartis, explained the pharmaceutical company’s decision to open a new global headquarters for research operations there: “We wanted to come and grow in Cambridge. This is where science is today and where science is going to be tomorrow.”
Google followed in Novartis’s footsteps, arriving in Kendall Square in 2006.
These large companies attracted new start-ups, like GnuBIO, a DNA sequencing company co-founded by Harvard physics professor David A. Weitz in 2009.
“It’s the DNA of the Square, the aura. There’s so much going on,” Weitz said, explaining Kendall’s thriving innovation community.
As big-name companies and fledgling start-ups have made their homes in Kendall Square, the district has adapted to meet the needs of the new arrivals. In just the past three years, 20 restaurants have opened in Kendall Square.
“Before there was one decent restaurant, Legal Sea Foods. We all ate there way too many times,” said Tim Rowe, co-founder of the Cambridge Innovation Center, an office space that caters to start-ups.
“It was certainly not a vibrant area before. You had to have a reason to go there,” said Jeremiah P. Murphy Jr. ’73, the president of the Coop, which has a branch in Kendall Square.
“SYNERGETIC”
Kendall Square’s booming science and tech industry has been a boon for MIT, which has courted several of these companies through various types of partnerships.
“What we’ve found is proximity is one of the key accelerators in science. We’re all right here,” said Sarah E. Gallop, co-director of government and community relations at MIT.
MIT has formed partnerships with companies including Novartis and Pfizer. Currently, MIT is building a facility for Pfizer, which will be located across the street from the school’s brain and cognitive science department.
For the most part, however, MIT has kept its distance from much of Kendall Square’s development.
The school has been a beneficiary rather than a driver of the area’s growth. Gallop said MIT had little responsibility for the growth of Kendall Square. “Our involvement was synergetic,” she said.
Harvard hopes to enter similar relationships with tech companies and businesses in Allston—a strategy known as co-development.
“Allston’s growing academic community will both benefit from and contribute to the neighborhood, promoting activity in the area and attracting new businesses and industries to Allston and greater Boston,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 put it in an interview with The Crimson in May.
Harvard’s expansion strategy diverges from MIT’s, however.
“The classical difference between Harvard and MIT is Harvard acquires land for institutional use,” said McCready, who was formerly Harvard’s director of Cambridge community relations.
THE KENDALL BLUEPRINT
In some ways, the initial phases of Harvard’s Allston development have already begun to mirror Kendall Square’s rise.
Kendall received a boost from the opening of the Cambridge Innovation Center in 1999.
The 160,000-square-foot facility provides resources and inexpensive office space for young entrepreneurs attracted to the area by high-profile tech and biomedical companies.
Steve Vinter, site director of Google’s Cambridge office, which previously rented space in the Cambridge Innovation Center, noted the important role the CIC played in making Kendall a hub for innovation.
“You need an incubator to attract the start-ups there and cornerstone tenants that you can build around,” Vinter said.
Founded in 2011, the Harvard Innovation Lab serves a similar purpose, striving to encourage entrepreneurship among students, faculty, and community members.
At the i-Lab, located across the street from the vacant swath of land that will one day be home to Harvard’s Allston Science Center, local entrepreneurs and University affiliates can receive support for launching their own ventures.
“We think of ourselves as a start-up within Harvard. We’re always open to new ideas,” said Gordon S. Jones, managing director of the i-Lab.
The i-Lab’s mission, however, differs from the CIC’s. Rowe, the co-founder and CEO of the Kendall incubator, said the companies at the CIC tend to be in more advanced stages of development than those at the i-Lab.
Allston has yet to attract big-name companies like those in Kendall. But the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences may relocate there, which could add an incentive for biotech businesses to establish a presence in Allston.
And the working-class Allston neighborhood has received financial backing from one of the industry giants located in Kendall Square. In 2011, Google—which according to Vinter has no plans to move out of Kendall Square—invested almost $30 million in the new Charlesview Apartment Complex, a construction project whose completion is key to the University’s plans for Allston. The new complex will free up the current complex’s land, which abuts the Business School.
The realization of Harvard’s dreams for Allston may be hindered by the fact that the area faces transporation issues Kendall Square did not. While Kendall benefits from its stop on the MBTA Red Line, Allston is only accessible by bus.
Sullivan pointed out some of the difficulties Harvard’s Allston hub will have to overcome: “Housing, transportation, and scientists all being in close proximity to one another—none of those things are present in Allston right now.”
Allston’s future as a center for science and innovation remains distant. After halting construction due to financial constraints in 2009, the University has just restarted planning in the past year. In July, Harvard announced that it will relaunch construction in 2014.
Kendall Square’s evolution is just one model that Allston might mimic.
“[Allston] will have its own character,” McCready said, “but no one knows what that is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Professor Lawrence H. Summers will lead a Washington think tank’s new project on developing fiscal policies that encourage more equal economic growth. He will not leave Harvard for the new post.
The Center for American Progress named Summers to the position on Monday. As a distinguished senior fellow, Summers will join former British Foreign Secretary David W. Miliband as a co-chair for the organization’s Growth and Development project. According to a press release, Summers’ work will focus on developing new ideas to stimulate middle-class job growth.
“This is a moment of great opportunity but also great risk in economic policy,” Summers said in the press release. He added that the government’s approach to economic recovery would need to address “deep structural changes” that lead to economic inequality and unemployment.
“I look forward to working with CAP on economically sound and politically viable approaches to these challenges,” Summers said.
Summers, who was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and was later tapped by President Barack Obama to lead his team of economic advisers at the National Economic Council, has taught economics as a University professor since returning to Cambridge at the end of 2010. Before serving as University president, Summers also was Treasury Secretary in Bill Clinton’s administration.
CAP President Neera Tanden said in the press release that she was excited to have Summers work on original ideas for economic policy at the center.
“As our country continues to confront challenges to establishing economic growth that is more broadly shared, there are few thinkers with Larry’s insights, keen intellect, and policy creativity,” Tanden said. “I’m thrilled he will be joining the Center for American Progress as we work to develop new ideas to solve the country’s problems.”
Founded in 2003, the organization describes its central mission as generating new policy ideas, critiquing policies based in conservative ideology, focusing media coverage on important issues, and helping shape political discourse. By coincidence, University President Drew G. Faust visited the think tank last week to speak about the need to maintain research and education funding in the national budget.

Harvard Business School professor emeritus Howard H. Stevenson is currently a trustee of some of Boston’s most prestigious organizations including the Boston Museum of Science and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Yet by all accounts, Stevenson’s life should have ended almost six years ago.
On January 3, 2007, Stevenson was walking across the Business School campus when he suffered a heart attack and collapsed in front of Baker Library. But thanks to a remarkable set of circumstances, he was rescued that day.
At the time, Baker Library was the only building on the Business School campus with a mobile defibrillator. While one colleague rushed inside, a second, who had just completed CPR training two weeks earlier, came to his side and began performing CPR.
Stevenson was rushed to Mount Auburn Hospital, where he was put into a medically induced coma. Three days later, he was brought out by doctors, who found no cognitive damage despite his heart having stopped for four minutes.
If Stevenson had passed away that day, he says he would not have had many regrets. Yet a former student, Eric C. Sinoway, was startled by the possibility of losing a close friend and mentor. Sinoway began to record some of the lessons Stevenson had taught him and ultimately published a book in October 2012 titled “Howard’s Gift: Uncommon Wisdom to Inspire Your Life’s Work.”
“At the moment that I learned Howard had cheated death,” Sinoway writes in the book’s opening pages, “I had made a subconscious decision...to capture some of the wisdom that Howard had been effortlessly dispensing—and to share that wisdom with people who’d never have the chance to learn from him directly.”
During Stevenson’s time at Harvard, he has worn many hats. When he retired from teaching in 2011, he had been a Harvard professor for 40 years. As senior associate dean of the Business School from 2001 to 2005, he led a capital campaign which raised close to $600 million. And from 2005 to 2007, he served as a vice provost of the University.
It was through Stevenson’s position as a vice provost that he and Sinoway first met. Sinoway, a student at the Kennedy School, was working on a project to understand the funding model of the University. He sought out Stevenson’s advice, and what began as an academic relationship soon developed into a deep personal bond.
“I thought that there were innumerable smart people at Harvard, obviously, but he was wise,” Sinoway said in an interview. “I thought that there was a big difference between intelligence and wisdom, and I gravitated towards him.”
In “Howard’s Gift,” Sinoway records a number of lessons that his mentor taught him, including Stevenson’s advice about the dangers of simultaneously taking on too many commitments.
“It’s possible to get straight A’s when you’re a student,” Stevenson says in the book. “But life is not a classroom. We can’t get an A on every facet of life every single day.... It’s almost one of the physical laws of the universe, like you can’t be in two places at the same time.”
Sinoway says that this lesson became apparent at a certain stage in Stevenson’s life. In 1982, Stevenson was the co-founder and first president of an investment company called the Baupost Group. While performing those duties in addition to his responsibilities at the Business School, Stevenson admitted in retrospect, he was “getting a B minus or a C plus in the overall father dimension.”
Then one day, Stevenson’s wife “walked away from their marriage,” leaving him with three boys, according to the book. That forced Stevenson to reconsider his priorities. He ultimately decided to step down from his position at Baupost, forgoing tens of millions of dollars of future income, the book says.
“It was a situation where I needed to earn a consistently good grade as a father, for an extended period,” Stevenson says in the book. “I couldn’t risk some aspect of my family responsibilities slipping through my fingers.”
During his divorce, Stevenson was convinced that he could learn important lessons from what he called was an inflection point.
“Was my first marriage a failure? It wasn’t successful, but it certainly wasn’t a failure,” Stevenson says in the book. “At a minimum, I’ve got three great sons and a slew of grandkids to prove that.”
Not only focused on Stevenson’s personal life, Sinoway writes that there are also important lessons to be learned from Stevenson’s professional career. Based on his work at the Business School researching entrepreneurship, Stevenson has emphasized the importance of applying an entrepreneurial spirit to all parts of life, which he defined as “the pursuit of opportunity without regard to the resources currently controlled.”
To Stevenson, being an entrepreneur is less of a career or personality type, and is instead a process anyone can participate in. He emphasizes a process of living life looking forward instead of backward.
Almost six years after his mentor’s close encounter with death, Sinoway said in an interview that he hopes that his book can convey to others some of the lessons he learned from Stevenson.
“For students at Harvard and elsewhere, we get so driven by success,” Sinoway said. “The question is, if you fast-forward your life 30 or 40 years, it’s great that you’re successful, but will you be satisfied?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As soon as Jeremy Lin ’10 stepped back on the court at Madison Square Garden Monday night, the magic was almost immediately back.
In his return to the arena that catapulted him from benchwarmer to celebrity less than a year ago, Lin had 22 points and eight assists to help his Rockets hand the Knicks their first home loss this season.
The 22 points were the second-highest total of the season for Lin, who has struggled thus far this year to adjust to playing with fellow newcomer and ball-dominant guard James Harden. Asked to assess his 2012 season before the game, Lin's response was, "terrible."
But on Monday night, he and Harden meshed together well, with the latter registering 28 points and 10 rebounds to help get the Rockets (12-12) back to .500 with a 109-96 victory.
After receiving a rousing applause from the home crowd—with some even giving him a standing ovation—Lin went to work early, scoring the Rockets’ first points on a layup and hitting four of his first five shots for a total of eight first-quarter points.
"Stay aggressive, be really aggressive—that was my mindset  coming in," Lin said. "Have  fun and let everything fall where it may."
He hit a three on his first shot attempt of the second period, and had 16 points at the half a week after tying his career-high with 38 points against the Spurs.
Though he missed his subsequent five long ball attempts, Lin went eight of nine from inside the arc, helping the Rockets to their second blowout win over the team that had entered the game with the Eastern Conference’s best record (18-5) but was playing without Carmelo Anthony.
"I just said, 'Tonight, I'm going to be free and fun," Lin said. "I'm  going  to throw everything else out the window and enjoy the game."
The Rockets also defeated New York, 131-103, in Houston on Nov. 23rd, with Lin chipping in 13 points and seven assists in that game.
Before Monday's contest, the point guard—who entered averaging 10.8 points and 6.0 assists per contest—stated that he would always be thankful for the memories he had of playing in the world’s most famous arena.
“It's definitely something I'll remember forever,” Lin said. “That was the beginning for me.... It'll always have a special place in my heart for sure.”

The point of finals period may be to finally complete those problem sets or crack the spine on the $300 textbook you were supposed to be reading all semester, but we all know what the end of classes actually means: extra procrastination time. Luckily, with the end of exams comes Winter Break, and with Winter Break comes the holidays. Whether you're planning on returning home to a Christmas tree, a menorah, or even just a non-bunk bed, here are a few Internet distractions to delightfully fill the time you'd otherwise be using to scroll through your Facebook newsfeed.
 
Awkward Family (Christmas) Photos
Awkward Family Photos is already an excellent way to pass the time—who doesn't love to see a father so dedicated to his own kin that he had the faces of his family tattooed onto his back? During this festive time of year, the website's "Christmas" tag produces golden results. There's this picture, that can only be described as "Sports Illustrated: Christmas" and this one which...we're still trying to figure out. Bonus points if you get your roommates to take a photo awkward enough to end up on the site.
 
Buddy's Snowball Fight
Elf is probably one of the best Christmas movies ever. Even though it came out in 2003, Buddy's legacy of spreading Christmas cheer lives on in the form of this addicting game. Why bother filling out study guides and attending cram sessions when you could virtually throw snowballs at elves? Just watch out for Santa—hit him and you're on the naughty list.
 
10 Worst Gag Gifts
Sometimes a good gift is just too hard to think of—so it's better to think of the absolute worst. Santa Claus beard beanies may be great for the hipster on your gift list, but according to this amusing list by Cracked.com, your broke uncle may not find a fake lottery ticket quite as funny. This same website also has other time-wasting, laugh-inducing holiday lists such as "The 5 Most Baffling Christmas-related Crimes" and for the music lover (hater?) in you, "The 4 Least Anticipated Christmas Albums of 2012."
 
Make Your Own Dreidel 
If you've ever played with a dreidel, you know it is simultaneously an exhilarating and frustrating experience to keep it spinning. Obviously, the best time to construct and play with your own is when you should be studying for a final, right? A couple websites (here, here, and here) have printable dreidel templates designed for 6-year-olds to create, so it should only take you an hour or so to successfully make your own. Get your roommates or whoever is around you in the library to participate in the dreidel festivities! Gambling and/or drinking games are encouraged.
 
Your House in a Snow Globe
This is, by far, one of the coolest Christmas-procrastination websites around. Type in any address, and voila!, by virtue of some sort of mysterious Google Earth technology, any house can be seen virtually in a snow globe. Even better, the site makes a donation to the Coalition for the Homeless on your behalf every time you make a new snow globe. Avoid your homework and do some good, all without leaving your desk!

There's an owl hanging around Harvard Square today. The photo above was taken at 7:30 a.m. near the pit. Later, around 1 p.m., the owl was seen perched near Boylston Hall. Let us know if you spot this beautiful bird and, if you do, snap a picture for the comments section!
