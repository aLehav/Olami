A few streets away from Harvard Yard, the Radcliffe Institute today stands as a marker of a time when Harvard and Radcliffe existed as two distinct spheres with distinct cultural codes, separated along gendered lines. By the early 1940s, Harvard began to enroll Radcliffe women into courses from which they had previously been barred admission. But even as the schools became integrated into one another, they continued to be separated by an odd ritual: Men and women, even if enrolled in the same courses, took separate exams.
The awkward wedge between the Harvard and Radcliffe policies was centered on the Radcliffe honor system that governed student life at the women’s college.
Today, Harvard is in the throes of cheating scandal, as University Hall begins to manage rumors of a forthcoming honor system. Rather than relying on individual governance like the Radcliffe honor code of old, today’s policies are structured around the idea that students fear the decisions of the Ad Board more than they care for their own sense of right and wrong.
The genealogy of the Radcliffe system provides a telling illustration of a different campus culture: one developed to sustain such a contract. Indeed, this code took shape and cemented itself into the ethos of Radcliffe just as the campus began to grow alongside the men’s college, marked by a spirit of individual direction.
Building Radcliffe, Building a Culture
 
 
The turn of the twentieth century had brought a great deal of growth and change to the nascent girls’ school, which until a decade earlier had been known simply as the Harvard Annex. Standing in the shadow of Harvard proper, the Annex’s position as an institution unto itself was tenuous. In its early years, the Annex lacked a robust collection of books of its own—not to mention a faculty—and so the girls of the Annex were necessarily dependent upon their relationship with Harvard to sustain the academic pursuits that drew them to Radcliffe. Women in those times had only as much access to an education as the Harvard men would give them.
By 1904, however, the weight of Radcliffe’s demand for emancipation began to converge upon the campus, both metaphorically and physically. Straining under the enormity of countless new books, the Fay House, where Radcliffe’s books were held, began to buckle onto itself as the foundation shuddered under the stress of the added weight.
A petition for a new library was put forward that year, and plans to build it were formally announced in June 1906. The library was to be situated on the other side of the Agassiz House, rounding out the Radcliffe campus architecturally and in spirit.
This moment of growth, inspired by the women of Radcliffe, saw to it that the success of Radcliffe women could be forged directly from their own campus. The honor code was immeasurably tied to this pursuit of self-determination.
“We hear so much about not letting college rob us of our individuality and convert us into mere automata…that we are likely to forget that we are members of society as well as individuals,” stated a Radcliffe Magazine editorial at the time. “A time has come for us to try to reconcile the two extremes, and become responsible and individual members of society.”
A Library and a Metaphor
 
 
When ground broke on the new library on April 27, 1907, John Shaw Billings, who had a hand in the development of the project, spoke to a crowd of students and staff. “A common method in preparing an address for an occasion like this is to begin by saying that this new addition to your resources brings with it increased duties and responsibilities,” he stated.
Billings’ speech rested on a recurring question: “Does the library of a college for young men differ from that of a college for young women, and if so, how?” Arriving at no answer, Billings’ query emphasized that conventions of gender still weighed heavily on the codes of conduct at Harvard and beyond.
A staff editorial published in Radcliffe Magazine took up Billings’ question.“We should remember that by the behavior of its students, severally and individually, our college will be judged,” stated the editorial. “[This] will be tested in each of our daily pursuits, but nowhere, perhaps, with more significance than in the library.”
Weaving together the themes of respect, freedom, and honor alongside an estimation of the library’s rightful place in the minds of the Radcliffe women, the editorial continued: “With the opening of our new library comes the opportunity for every girl to show her respect for the rights of others…a place where each one shall be free to work and to think undisturbed.”
According to the honor system, the library would be entirely self-governed, without security points at check-out and without monitors to supervise noise. The library system was to be more than just a place to store books. It was a space where questions of privilege, freedom, and gender could be mediated and where self-efficacy could be realized.
The code, which was instituted by the Radcliffe Student Government in the early twentieth century and which lasted into the 1950s, extended far beyond the library itself. It governed the undergraduate careers of all Radcliffe women, from comings and goings in the dorms to extracurricular pursuits outside of them.
When women left the dorm halls, no one watched at the door to assure they followed curfew. If a girl was late, she could simply lie in the book. “Perhaps the whole Radcliffe philosophy of education can be expressed best in one symbol–the dormitory key that is entrusted to each student,” read the Radcliffe freshman Register of 1959.
Girls and Boys
 
 
When the suggestion emerged over 40 years later that Harvard and Radcliffe take joint exams, the cultural differences between the two schools were thrown on display. Such an endeavor would necessitate a Harvard honor system matching Radcliffe’s: a cultural incongruence that seemed insurmountable. Where the men’s exam rituals included proctors, dress codes, and a strict ban on silence, the Radcliffe women took unproctored exams, relished the chance to wear informal pants instead of skirts, and could enter and exit the building as they wished so long as they did not cheat.
For Harvard, such a code would include the duty to report any cheating by a peer. This wouldn’t fly in the old-boys’ network. And for the Radcliffe girls, doing away with their honor system would mean turning their backs on the comfort, safety, and individualism that such a code of conduct had afforded them for decades.
Noting the distinct cultures of the two schools, a dean at Radcliffe admitted to The Crimson in 1957 that the adoption of an honor code at Harvard was unlikely. “I can’t think of an effective self-governing system for Harvard,” she said.
A New Standard
 
Eventually joint exams did, however, become the new norm. This was in part abetted by deteriorating faith in the honor code caused by a string of thefts in the 1950s and growing unrest regarding the existence of any curfew rules whatsoever. By the early 1960s Radcliffe and Harvard had become so interconnected that the cultural differences between the two had ceased to be anything more than symbolic. And as the student body of a nearly-unified Harvard looked outwardly at the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement, reservations against joint exams subsided and the code eventually faded into the tumult of the 1960s. Today no such honor code exists.
The sort of divisions that define Old Harvard have now dissipated, and with it the sense of urgency for self-determination that guided the Radcliffe honor code has subsided.
Yet past voices produce enduring wisdom. Pausing to consider a student’s responsibility to a college in 1907, an unnamed member of the Radcliffe Magazine editorial board wrote on the privilege of living and studying in Cambridge, Mass.
“As individuals, perhaps, no one can deny our right to be as noisy, as disorderly, as unpunctual as well like; the greatest harm in every case is done to ourselves,” she wrote. “We need only to carry the theory of individuality a little farther, and make it include individual responsibility…As soon as that day comes we may hope for a system of student government to which every[one] will conform, not as a duty merely, but as a privilege.”

Unless workers have uncovered dinosaur fossils or struck oil around the Science Center overpass, there is no excuse for the unending construction in front of Annenberg. In lieu of actually figuring out what’s going on over there, FM has come up with 15 alternative ideas for the site:
1. A syringe-free ball pit.
2. Another Starbucks, so that no one has to walk all the way to Greenhouse Cafe.
3. Segway parking.
4. An ice sculpture of Drew Faust.
5. A reflection pond for where the sculpture used to be.
6. A life-sized dinosaur (made with the bones that we assume they are uncovering).
7. A vegetarian McDonalds.
8. A labyrinth—gotta spice things up once everyone has finally figured out where their classes are located.
9. A moat to keep the tourists away.
10. A small farm with a chicken coop to produce our locally grown cage-free eggs. Hot breakfast, anyone?
11. A permanent tent to encourage the return of Occupy—or the circus, we’re not picky.
12. A huge speaker that constantly plays construction noises.
13. A bell tower that rings seven minutes after the hour.
14. A new John Harvard statue combination toilet, complete with camera tripod and hand sanitizer.
15. More rocks.

We hear cartographic-chic is in. Hanging an 18th century map of the Americas, complete with decorative cartouches, on your barren white wall might be just what you need to showcase both your intellectual and artistic sides.
Tucked away in the basement of Lamont in Pusey Library, the Harvard Map Collection houses more than 500,000 maps. For the past six years, the collection has offered to print oversized colored, copies for Harvard affiliates.
You can browse through the collection in Hollis and choose the one most suitable for your tastes. All that’s left to do is to visit the collection, set up an account, and pay using Crimson Cash. In addition, you will need to sign the Map Collection Scanning Services Agreement, which can be found on the collection’s website.
For a grand total of two dollars per square foot, you can own an abstract imitation of the world around you. For an extra 10 bucks, the library can print it on glossy paper. Turnaround time averages a couple of days.
“It’s definitely cheaper than Kinko’s,” joked Jonathan M. Rosenwasser, the collection management assistant.
Options range from colonial representations of Boston, to more modern varieties. These topographical masterpieces can be seen as more than just representations of terrains and political boundaries. Students can use them to gain a sense of how people viewed the world, Rosenwasser said.
Uninhibited by geological accuracy, older maps usually feature ornamental images to promote the cartographer’s agenda, such as showcasing sights and images associated with a given country.
Or, there might be another phenomenon at play. “Cartographers used the decorative elements to fill in the empty space of places that hadn’t been explored yet,” Rosenwasser explained.

The glory days are gone. We lovers of the Hawaiian shirt could once gaze admiringly at Al Pacino in “Scarface” and intimidating bouncers at the coolest clubs. Muscular athletes and emaciated hipsters alike could sport the always cool, always appropriate Hawaiian shirt. Now, the only associations we tropical shirt aficionados can hold onto are Kramer, Peter Griffin, and “fun dads” from the suburbs. The Hawaiian shirt is out. But honestly, in a field like this, who would want to be in?
Modern fashion is obviously an extended exercise in deceit, a lying game that we honest, humble lovers of the Hawaiian shirt refuse to play. Landlubbers sport lobster shorts, country clubbers favor flannel, and prep school girls don North Face even though their idea of an adventure is a walk on the Brooklyn Bridge or one too many skinny girl margaritas.
Even indie culture has lost its allure after years of seepage into the mainstream that have culminated in Lana Del Rey, vintage sweaters more expensive than Ralph Lauren vests, and my whole high school rugby team getting into fixies all of a sudden. And if you ever doubted that we were living out the Hip-pocalypse for real, please note that the guy who founded Urban Outfitters donated thousands of dollars to the Rick Santorum campaign.
This much is clear: These days, being stylish is no way to show you have style. If you want to stick it to the man, then you’ve got to go balls-out tasteless. Do you like dancing flamingos? Then put dancing flamingos on your shirt! You like flowers? Spam? Orientalist sexual fantasies? There’s plenty of room for all that on your torso as well!
Only one piece of clothing defines cool by being the epitome of uncool. Only in a Hawaiian shirt can you reveal your true self and let your imagination run wild. It’s time the adventurous men and women of today learned a lesson from the guys who are clearly having the most fun out of anyone: overweight tourists from remote, landlocked areas.
Fight the power. Go Hawaiian. And remember the words of Rousseau: “Man is born free but lives everywhere in graphic t-shirts.”

Look around. Do you see sparkling tropical oceans? Do you see a sandy beach? No. We are in an urban environment where the nearest body of water is even colder than Boston manners. After a summer of enduring the sight of desperate nerds donning colorful fabrics in a sad attempt at fun, I have had enough. The Hawaiian shirt must go.
Don’t get me wrong: I’m all for celebrating one’s origins. If this is the case, though, why aren’t all you tri-state d-bags wearing shirts with armpits that perpetually smell like the body odor of industry from the state called “New Jersey”? When you see someone wearing a dress that looks like a potato sack, you don’t call it the “Idaho,” do you? How about West Coasters dress themselves only in a fairy crown of marijuana leaves and dub it “California”?
Listen, underdressed idiots of the world: as a concerned citizen of the Greater Boston Area, I ask you, what has happened to business casual? You wouldn’t wear sandals with socks. Sun visors are for athletic people —and, let’s face it, the only ones who can really pull them off are Olympians. Cargo shorts, by the way, are for virgins. So why do you insist on besmudging our community’s street cred by donning the main accoutrement of the middle-aged dad?
Take off the tacky florals and accept that the closest thing to Hawaii is in your punch bowl.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost a year to the day since Elizabeth Warren declared her candidacy for the U.S. Senate outside a South Boston MBTA station, Democratic political consultants and professors said that the Harvard Law School professor still faces the same uphill battle that has beguiled her campaign since its earliest days.
Trailing incumbent U.S. Senator Scott Brown by a slight margin with only 54 days remaining before the Nov. 6 election, those experts said Warren will have to overcome the tide of public opinion and prove to Massachusetts voters that she, not her opponent, is best suited to fight on their behalf. The delivery of that message—one that politicos say Warren has mishandled thus far—could be the race’s deciding factor.
From its outset, the race was expected to be one of the most expensive and hard-fought in the country, pitting a popular incumbent Republican against the Democratic party’s progressive darling in a high-stakes face-off for Massachusetts’s junior U.S. Senate seat. When Warren entered the fray last September, experts said Brown’s popularity and political savvy paired with Warren’s political inexperience would make the race—even in a traditionally blue state like Massachusetts—difficult for Democrats to win.
Now, with a year of campaigning behind her, Warren is anything but inexperienced, but political consultants and political science professors said she has failed to grasp the heart of the problems facing her campaign. Specifically, those familiar with the race said that Warren’s messaging, in advertising and campaign speeches, has failed to persuade voters.
“My critique of it is simple: it’s not about Massachusetts,” said Democratic political consultant Dan Payne. “It’s as though she’s running a national campaign. Brown, on the other hand, his advertising is very attached to the state.”
While Brown has found success and popularity in retail politics, easily relating to voters—a recent poll showed his approval rating at 53 percent—Warren has stuck to the issues, struggling to appeal to voters on a personal level.
“I don’t think the issues are anywhere near relevant in this race. The question is: Is she senatorial and is Brown credible as an independent thinker?” said Harvard Kennedy School lecturer M. Marty Linsky. “I think it is very hard for a person who has been in her head apparently successfully so long to start competing between the neck and the navel.”
Democratic consultants observing the campaign said this type of campaigning will mean forcing the seasoned-campaigner Brown into unscripted situations and exposing his Republican loyalties, as well as recasting the Warren narrative around connections with voters instead political platitudes.
“Brown has been around for a long time and more people know him than Elizabeth Warren. As a result, because they know him and like him, it is easier for him to define who Elizabeth Warren is,” Democratic political consultant Mary Anne Marsh said. “I think the Warren campaign has been hitting back, but they also could hit back harder.”
Payne put it more directly: “Brown has been running a seemingly effortless campaign,” he said. Brown’s easy-going relatability on the campaign trail paired with his perceived moderate Republican stances have allowed him to control the tenor of the race on issues small and large, Payne added.
Whether Warren can change that dynamic will largely be determined by debates, consultants said, which should provide a key, high-profile opportunity for the candidates to engage directly. Such an opportunity could be enough for Warren to hit the restart button on her campaign, Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman said.
Massachusetts politicos credit the 2010 debates between Brown and Democratic challenger Martha M. Coakley with determining the outcome of that race. Coakley, who was the frontrunner heading into the the special election debates, came off stiff and out of touch, opening the door for a once-unlikely Brown victory, they said.
Warren, who like Coakley has faced accusations of stiffness and being out of touch, will have to leave the issues behind and appeal to voters on a personal level.
“I think it’s much more a question of will than skill,” Linksy said. “Her willingness to be uncomfortable, to do the things she is uncomfortable with, and present herself in a way she’s uncomfortable with.
”Warren’s campaign declined to comment for this story, but the Boston Globe reported Wednesday that it was considering a change in message in light of mounting pressure from Democratic leaders. The camp released the first in a series of new advertisements Wednesday afternoon themed “Your Fight is Elizabeth’s Fight.”

A note to our dearest readers: A good weather to you! We know this new section of The Harvard Crimson might strike you as strange and frightening, unusual content the likes of which you have never before encountered. But do not be alarmed! We humble weathermen wish only to share our passion (publish it, perhaps?) for the wonder that is the climate. Every good news source needs a good weather team. So allow us to be your guide, your muse, your Anderson Cooper, your Guy Fieri, your Willy Wonka as we all together venture forward into the unknown of last week’s weather.
Signed,
Weathermen
This week in last week’s weather, we talk about the weather from last week:
A despondent return beckoned by a despondent sky. Sweaty hands met sweaty hands in awkward shaking gestures as high humidity filled the void of loneliness heralded by the end of August. My summer girlfriend left me just in time for the rain to arrive on Friday; it was at least 98 percent wet. An oppressive rain, but merciful enough to allow the umbrellas to see another day, which sucks for the umbrellas ’cause that day will be rainy, too. Thankfully, though, rain meant we could all wear boat shoes everyday without looking like a bunch of batty posh boys–they are, after all, water resistant. Sun came and went in an unimpressed cantor toward the latter part of the week: not a bad time to be lifting futons up four flights of stairs, or to gondola nude down the Charles. A merry welcome back to New England weather for us all.
Aggregate score: 3.4 out of 10.

I am late to Billie Mandle’s talk on photography. I hate being late and I’m dreading the few seconds when I open the door and it feels like everyone’s eyes are on me. There are no open seats in the cramped classroom, filled with students staring at their illuminated laptops, so I find an open spot on the floor. I’m wearing a skirt so any way I contort my body feels awkward.
Shudders cover the windows and the lighting is dim. Attention is focused on the screen in front of the classroom, where a photographic image is being projected. In it, I see a dark wooden room with a single window to the left covered by a white curtain—lace.
Using a camera with a long-exposure time, Billie explains that she photographed the inside of confessionals for 10 minutes. She says she aimed to capture the essence of private, of a place where one is forced to confront truth.
Then the image on the screen changes.  This room is much smaller. It is also dark and wooden and has a bench attached to the wall. I can see handprints in the dust that have collected on the bench.
I thought all confessionals were simple wooden boxes, but Billie’s photographs show something different. There are some with bright colors, some dirty, some with a little light, some rustic, some concrete, some untouched. I have never been in a confessional before—not because I don’t believe in the act, but because I’m not Catholic.
Her work is called “Reconciliation.” I like that.
Maybe If I Just Say It in One Go…

Me: Hello?
Priest: How may I help you, my daughter?
Me: Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was never.
Priest: What is it you would like to confess?
I look for the bright colors, the rustic qualities, the newness, the darkness, but all I see are my hands. I feel the dust. I press down—firmly, to make a handprint. I guess people’s secrets aren’t the only dirt left behind.
Me: I killed my brother.
Me: I hurt my brother.
Me: I betrayed my brother.
Me: I pushed my brother away.
Priest: You pushed your brother away?
Me: Yes. I physically pushed him away when I was in third grade and he was in the first grade. He wanted to give me a hug and I pushed him away. I hurt his feelings.
Priest: “Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.”
Me: 1 John 3:15. I know that verse by heart.
The Present
 
I am sitting on the floor of a crowded classroom in Sackler 318 because I am late. Billie Mandle has just explained her work, “Reconciliation,” where she went around the world and photographed the insides of confessionals. She shifts gears to talk about her most recent project: photographing the insides of parking garages.
Her photographs make the grime and dirt stains look abstract and painterly. And the way she captured the light, sometimes appearing to dance on the wall, make these lots seem more sacred, more spiritual than the confessionals I was seeing moments ago. I recognize the concrete walls and the crusted dirt that are the parking garage aesthetic. But I can’t put my finger on what it is that makes them seem so beautiful. Still, those are not places where I would want to leave handprints.
I took off the parking lines, she says.  Billie explains that her dad paints the yellow lines in parking garages and, as a way of taking ownership of the photograph, she digitally erased the yellow lines.
The Story
 
I was in the third grade; my brother was in the first. We were both coming in from playing on the school’s primary colored playground set. I was standing in the yellow parking line designated specifically for third graders. My brother came up to me, as he always had done since we had switched to this new school, and tried to give me a hug. I had always reciprocated, but this time…
I can’t even remember the look on his face. Once I had peeled his arms off me, I turned away and focused on staying on my yellow line because soon Ms. Scheonhals would be here and take us inside. When we got home everything seemed fine. I hadn’t thought about it at all. But then he took my mom to another room and started crying, recounting the event.
I began defending myself immediately.  I told him that he shouldn’t have wanted to hug me in the first place. That it was weird to hug him. That it was weird to publicly show affection to family members. That it was weird that he was crying.
Fast forward ten years. My mom and are sitting at our kitchen table, and I’m frustrated as ever with my brother.
“Why doesn’t he ever talk to me? Why is our relationship so sour?”
“Te acuerdas de ese día cuando no lo querías abrazar?” 
“Yes, but that was a long time ago. You can’t blame me for all of this.
“No te sientes culpable, pero…como era nene chiquito, te admiraba mucho." 
“I know I hurt him. But what can I do now?”
 My Reconciliation
 
(Sigh) I’m sorry. I can go to Dickson Bros. and buy some black paint to spill over the yellow lines.  Kind of like Billie did. You know where the shop is: We walked by it when you visited me for spring break. And you quickly hugged me goodbye before you left in the taxi. And that was fine.Are we reconciled?
 But the Reality of the Matter Is…
 
The intimacy would be too bizarre. I don’t know how to hug him. It’s weird. Writing this is weird. If he reads this and things change, well, that will be weird too. If he tries and hugs me, like for real, that would be weird. But I don’t want it to be weird.  I want it to just be.

Where belated summer recaps and finalized study cards can fail to sustain Saturday small talk, impassioned lip-syncing triumphs over the most blaring of music and the dimmest lights, transforming meaningless back-and-forth between strangers into jovial revelry among friends. Below, five songs guaranteed to inspire heartfelt participation—soulful singing and outrageous hand motions mandatory.
“I Want It That Way” by The Backstreet Boys
The epitome of sappy boy band ballads, this song will instantly situate acquaintances in the kind of trusting relationship that can only emerge from acknowledging someone as your fire and one desire.
“Lean On Me” by Bill Withers
This song will make you remember the people you can depend on, even if you only met them four minutes ago. There’s nothing like swaying along to this one with your eyes closed and your arm around a (new?) friend’s shoulder.
“Don’t Stop Believin’” by Journey
Everyone from small town girls to city boys has a soft spot for this classic. With a chorus of only 12 words that repeats again and again, there’s no excuse for not belting along with this timeless party favorite.
“Help!” by The Beatles
If you’re not feeling so self-assured, this song will both verbalize your insecurities and win you friends of superior—if generically nostalgic—music judgment.
Any country song. . .
I mean, they’re all about tractors and dirt roads and ponies anyway, right? How hard can it be?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An exotic far-off getaway, regional food, loud drumming, and more chocolate candy than you could eat in a year—there’s something for everyone at Harvard’s annual Student Activities Fair. This event, which was held last Friday in the remodeled Student Organization Center at Hilles and the Radcliffe Quad, is the official introduction of first-years to Harvard’s 450 registered student organizations.
The annual Activities Fair serves an important purpose on Harvard’s campus—after all, how else would you know that Harvard has a Half-Asian People’s Association, a Klezmer band, or a Wisconsin Club? It’s certainly exciting to see the majority of Harvard’s extracurricular organizations enthusiastically proponing their activities and mailing lists, and the oh-so-useful-Student Organization Center whose name no student knows how to pronounce is a good venue to admire the diversity of Harvard students’ pursuits. And of course, as any student knows, the Activities Fair is an ideal place to acquire a plethora of free merchandise and fun-sized Snickers bars.
Indeed, the Activities Fair is one of the occasions that brings nearly every Harvard undergraduate together. However, this is largely because nearly all dining halls are closed, forcing upperclassmen as well as first-years to walk to the Quad for a “Taste of Boston Dinner” at the Activities Fair.
Although sampling cuisine from the North End and Chinatown is great, this arrangement seems unnecessary. In effort to make future Activities Fairs less crowded, we would recommend that Harvard University Dining Services keep house dining halls open during future Activity Fairs. Other simple fixes, like an improved arrangement of tables and an online guide to table locations, would also make the Fair less hectic. Lastly, we understand the excitement and spirit of competition that inspires students to aggressive hand out information to all who pass by their organizations’ tables. However, for the sake of making the Activities Fair a bit less stressful for everyone, we wish student organizations’ representatives would refrain from such aggressive leafletting.
Beyond the Activities Fair, the Office of Student Life could do a lot to make the student organizations scene more understandable, accessible, and navigable for freshmen. With hundreds of different student organizations, it’s understandable that newcomers often feel overwhelmed and confused in their first few weeks at Harvard. If there were an easily searchable online database of organizations that included updated information about their first meetings, first-years (and older students looking to join new groups) would not have to depend on an incomplete Guide to Get Involved Weekend website that was last updated weeks before school started. A version of the Q guide for student organizations, or another organized database of information about student groups, would also be useful.
It’s now the middle of September, a honeymoon period for first-year students; they just are beginning to discover the extracurricular activities where they can find close communities, and have not yet become frustrated enough to unsubscribe from three-quarters of the email lists they’ve signed up for. We wish first-years the best of luck in their search for student organizations to join—and hope that you all discover, sooner rather than later, that you should really just comp The Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we finally got to Saint-Denis, the final destination on Metro line 13, the children rejoiced with “hallelujah, hallelujah.” Perhaps ironically, the opposite end of the line includes the chic commercial and nightlife district of Champs-Élysées–Clemenceau. Yet, the children’s hallelujah struck me because it was the first time “Saint-Denis” wasn’t followed by “why do you want to go there?” I heard over and over again from the French that the problems faced by North Africans and other immigrant groups living in the banlieues, or suburbs, of Paris, were not the result of racism. The problem could not be compared to redlining in the United States, because “the French are just not racist”.
I was shocked to be met with the gripping reality that the victims of a hushed system of racism, religious intolerance, poverty, inequality, and injustice were all concentrated in the outskirts of Paris where “the French” do not go and do not have to come to terms with the realities of the social situation in their country.
Despite their legal French citizenship, many second- and third-generation North Africans live in overcrowded tenements with their parents and new migrants of Arab or sub-Saharan African origin. They are palpably isolated from mainstream French society. One of the most easily identifiable causes of this is the lack of convenient transportation between the suburbs and city center, which makes finding a job exceedingly difficult. I had to take two separate above-ground trains to get to this Saint-Denis and an above-ground train and two buses to get to Clichy-sous-Bois, the site of major uprisings in 2005 by French youth of North African origin after alleged police profiling led to the death of two teens. When second- and third-generation North Africans do reach the center of the city, the French and the police take notice. I watched as the French police pulled a North African man, presumably coming from the suburbs, up against the wall inside the subway station and patted him down. It was humiliating. As one British tourist astutely noted aloud on the subway, “They profile here.”  Isabelle Gillette-Faye, a French sociologist and Director of La federation GAMS, an organization dedicated to the fight against female genital mutilations, forced marriages, and violence against women says “people watch [he North Africans and their children] like strangers,” which makes it difficult for them to find jobs or housing.
The association between Islam and the North African population has also allowed new ways to marginalize the population as a threat to French society. The rise of Islamophobia has pushed candidates on the far-right such as Marine Le Pen to focus on immigration policy by painting North African Muslims as incompatible with the French Republic. Sakina, a Moroccan high school student living in Clichy-sous-Bois told me the French do not accept the growing establishment of halal meat in fast-food restaurants. Sakina’s friend Samira agreed, calling the French “hypocrites” and “egoists”. Gillette-Faye said that the French are unwilling to accept that Islam has become the second religion of France. There is a very strong conviction of what it means to be French in France. “They pray in the streets, why do they do that?” That is not French. Public expressions of religion are not French.
Most North African youth, however, are not concerned with politics of religion. The biggest problems they suffer are far beyond the scope of freedom of religious expression. Crime, violence (especially against women), drug abuse, and poverty are just a few of the problems that plague inhabitants of the suburbs rejected and alienated by French society. “The police do not go there,” I was told several times in reference to Saint-Denis. Lamia, an inhabitant of Saint-Denis who moved from Algeria to live with her French husband, works as a housekeeper for a family in Paris (she does not include Saint-Denis in her definition of Paris). Lamia explained that despite the fact that she must wear her bag across her chest (comparing it to the way I hold my bag on my shoulder), to avoid robbery, she still prefers her suburb to Paris. She adds that despite the superior infrastructure in Paris, she enjoys the environment of Saint-Denis, where she can be free from racism. Gillette-Faye says, “Racism [in France] increases every day,” but denying the existence of this ongoing problem is “typically French”.
The French see their colonial history as a great shame and rightly so, but to deny history does not mean the outcomes of that history will just disappear. The Republic does not cater to the values of its entire population nor does it really recognize all the populations that make up the Republic. To say that the problem is simply one of rich vs. poor or North African Muslims not being compatible with the French way of life is to not understand the depth of French history and “French culture” in its entirety. Ignoring the realities of the existing situation limits the potential for progress in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 2010, I moved to Cambridge to join the faculty of Harvard Divinity School.  Fall and winter of that year were horrible. The snowfall began in October and did not cease until late spring; the December dusk at 4 p.m. made me long for the southern California sun that my family had walked away from; and I was having trouble keeping up with the frenetic pace of my new job.
Sleep was an indulgence that it seemed a tenure-track professor could not afford. Either my slacks were shrinking by the day or my waistline was growing—I tried to convince myself it was the former. And rising rental costs had my family as broke as the Ten Commandments.
Yet the real problem was that I had become almost unrecognizable to my family. The hide-and-go-seek playing, flag-football-coaching, nightly-dinner-cooking father and husband had somehow become “that cranky man” who never came out of his office.
I am confident that my experience is far from foreign to students and professionals across the country. Whether one attends Harvard, Stanford, or Georgia Tech, increasing tuition costs and an anemic job market contribute to what are already hyper-competitive environments. Nor were my attempts to keep pace on the academic tenure-track very different from the efforts of investors running down the halls at Goldman Sachs or medical professionals sprinting through understaffed emergency rooms. But in the shadow of America’s Great Recession, where millions face long-term unemployment and underemployment, how dare one ever complain?
By the spring, however, life was turning around. There were two principal reasons.   For one, I was invited to become a resident scholar in Lowell House. Unlimited hot food in the dining hall coupled with warm people helped to thaw out my family’s frozen tushes. But most importantly, a dear colleague and friend referred me to Harvard University Behavioral Health Systems on the second floor of Holyoke Center.
To be sure, I was apprehensive. Where I come from, a genteel Southern community outside of Atlanta, any conversation about mental health evokes images of straightjackets and padded walls. Discussing mental illness is even more taboo than the topic of sex or drug addiction. Such conversations are not appropriate among “polite company.” Nor did my faith community afford me (or anyone else) the freedom to hurt. Admitting that one is confused, burdened, or depressed is an anathema. You might as well show up in church and tell everyone that you are demon-possessed.
Nevertheless, I sought counseling. When my first session ended, I felt normal for the first time in months. I was still stressed and fatigued, but my therapist helped me to put these feelings in context. I learned how factors such as stress, insomnia, and even lack of sunlight are all tied to serotonin production.
Yet with regular visits to the second floor of Holyoke and a treatment plan, I was soon back to my old self—maybe even a better self. Twelve months later, I was awarded tenure and then named the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister of the Memorial Church. What a difference a year makes.
I share this story not as a testimony of my accomplishments, but rather to reveal a subsequent moral lapse. I confess, I have not visited the second floor of Holyoke this fall. Why? Because shame once again got the best of me.
What would people think if they saw the Pusey Minister of Memorial Church sitting in the behavioral health waiting room in Holyoke? This is the question that I asked myself. Thus I requested that the receptionist provide me with the name of a healthcare provider “outside of Cambridge.” Yes, I had overcome the stigma of getting help. But the shame associated with public knowledge of receiving treatment remained.
Fortunately, my childhood pastor was correct when he said that preachers must avail themselves to the truths they proclaim. My sermon on Sunday, A Moral Man’s Moral Lapse, pointed to the way Jesus treated a Syrophoenician woman badly due to the stress and strain associated with his own ministerial success. I referenced Dean Evelynn Hammonds’s message to Harvard College about mental health and depression. “Don’t suffer in silence,” she told us, “we are here to support you.” And then I continued, “Seeking help to manage stress, identify resource to alleviate anxiety, and even taking the appropriate doctor prescribed medications to mollify mental illnesses are neither signs of weakness nor concessions to failure.”
Immediately, as the next line of the sermon poured from my lips, I realized the folly of my ways. If I am to have a moral voice, I cannot use it only to help others, but must also model the behaviors I encourage. Why should I care about who sees me on the second floor of Holyoke? Instead, I should be inviting and encouraging others to come along. This university has great resources to help us manage the many stressors associated with professional life. We should never be ashamed to take advantage of them!
So, I made my appointment this week. Might you consider joining me?
Jonathan L. Walton is the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister of the Memorial Church.

To the Editor:
With regards to your editorial of September 7 "My, Oh My.Harvard," let me begin by saying that I agree with all of your essential points. Many of the online tools currently offered by Harvard University Information Technology are clunky and inadequate. We have, in the past, failed to utilize the amazing pool of talent that the students present. But we are working to change this, and welcome the opportunity the editorial provides to jumpstart this change.
The re-design of the look and feel of the my.harvard landing page was, as you point out, a modest beginning. But it was a beginning—a project initiated by student input, involving the designs submitted by students, and aided through implementation by continuous student input. While there is much that can still be improved in the my.harvard experience, this small change demonstrated the power of involving students. HUIT now supports two pre-term planning tools; the older one which was complex enough to require a video tutorial, and a new one incorporated into my.harvard, designed in conjunction with students that, while not perfect, has gotten much better reviews.
We have also re-engaged the HUIT student advisory council, worked with the Undergraduate Council to define the IT problems that are most troubling to the students, and have begun work on some of those fixes.  For example, we are working with students to identify and rectify various wireless dead spots on campus; students can access the result of this work online through iSites.
At the same time, we are trying to be more agile and innovative in supporting student-led projects. We are actively working with Professor Malan and the staff of CS50 to identify data feeds that we can provide for student projects. We have implemented UserVoice, which allows feedback to be collected. We are also trying new ways of supporting student written tools. For example, we are working with the authors of the harvard-class.com website, which gives a nice interface for course selection, to see how we can best support this tool.
These are only a start, and we welcome your suggestions and help in accelerating the change. If you have ideas, please talk with members of the Undergraduate Council, or get in touch with Shannon Rice (shannon_rice@harvard.edu). If you have a tool that you would like to share with the community, or an idea for such a tool and the desire to build it, get in touch with the University Chief Technical Officer, Jim Waldo (jim_waldo@harvard.edu). Working together, we can make the changes to provide the IT infrastructure that the Crimson so rightly pointed out is lacking.
Sincerely,
Anne Margulies
Vice President and University Chief Information Officer
Cambridge, Mass.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University President Drew G. Faust has fought for immigration rights and brought the Reserve Officers’ Training Corp back to campus. And with the Tuesday premier of “Death and the Civil War,” an adaption of her book, she will extend her presence to the world of TV.
On Wednesday, Faust embarked on a speaking tour for the film, which acclaimed filmmaker Ric Burns adapted from her 2008 book “This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War.”
The film, which chronicles the impact of the Civil War’s unprecedented casualty count on the American people, is part of PBS’s American Experience series.
“Drew did something really amazing. She went to a topic that’s been written about, and written about, and written about, and managed to say something absolutely new,” Burns said. “Deep in the heart of [the book] is an extraordinary narrative of individuals and...of a nation trying to get home again under radically changed circumstances.”
Burns said that he especially appreciated the opportunity to work closely with Faust.
"I work for public television. It was the best thing I’ve ever had to have the president of Harvard as my research assistant,” Burns said.
Faust, who served as a consultant during the making of the film, would often email Burns with research suggestions and names of potential interview subjects, Burns said. From the beginning of the process, Faust trusted Burns to translate the book into a documentary that accurately captured the essence of her work, she said.
“For me, I could feel very safe in trusting him for translating the book into film,” she said. “It was his decision about how to get there and I’m just so delighted about the final product.”
In addition to authoring the book that served as inspiration for the film, Faust also sat for two interviews for the movie.
Burns first tackled the subject of the Civil War with his brother, fellow filmmaker Ken Burns, in 1990, when the pair produced the series “The Civil War.” Ric Burns said that when WGBH Boston approached him with Faust’s book, he jumped at the opportunity to return to the topic.
“It’s been an extraordinary, transforming experience to revisit the subject and to see it through Drew Faust’s eyes,” Burns said. “It’s been a revelation for me.”
Faust’s tour will end Tuesday with a screening of the film at the American Repertory Theater in Harvard Square.
Faust said that the project has been met with enthusiasm from a variety of Harvard affiliates, many of whom attended a WGBH event for the film. Others will meet with her at events in Washington D.C. and New York this week.
“I’m delighted to be able to have this Civil War passion and engagement interact with my Harvard presidential role in this way,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The shocking withdrawal of  Kyle Casey and the expected departure of Brandyn Curry from school has focused much of the media attention on the co-captains of the Harvard men’s basketball team. So far, much less ink has been spilled on those players who still remain on the Crimson roster
The foundation of the 2011-12 team that won the Ivy League championship and made Harvard’s first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1946 is gone. Last year’s co-captains, Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, graduated alongside classmate Andrew Van Nest ’12. Sharpshooter Corbin Miller departed for a two-year Mormon mission, and highly touted recruit Max Hooper transferred to Saint John’s. The Crimson expected Harvard-Westlake’s Zena Edosomwan, the highest-rated recruit ever to commit to an Ivy League school, to offset some of this attrition, but after failing to meet Harvard’s Academic Index requirements, Edosomwan returned for one more year of high school and plans to join the Class of 2017.
Assuming, as expected, Curry leaves as well as Casey, Harvard will find itself relying on a largely untested group to retain its place at the top of the conference—as it stands now, the team will return just two players who averaged over 15 minutes per game last season. What rotation will  the Crimson rely on in its bid to defend its Ivy crown and return to the NCAA Tournament?
Despite the loss of Casey, perhaps the frontrunner for Ivy League Player of the Year, the situation at forward is far from desperate. Sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis impressed in stints off the bench last year and Kenyatta Smith—the highest rated prospect of the bunch—showed signs of delivering on his promise of becoming a dominant force down low during the team’s summer trip to Italy. With Smith the tallest of the bunch at 6’8”, the group may be undersized from a national perspective, but this is nothing new for Harvard; last year’s duo of Wright and Casey were able to control play in the paint in the Ivy League, though neither of them stood above that height. Junior seven-footer Ugo Okam may see an increased role, while freshman Agunwa Okolie might also play significant minutes.
The situation at wing is largely unchanged. Senior Christian Webster and junior Laurent Rivard should remain threats from the perimeter. Sophomore Wes Saunders will play a slashing role, taking advantage of his superior athletic ability to get to the basket. The majority of the scoring load should fall on the shoulders of this trio.
Harvard will feel the effects of the cheating scandal most acutely at guard. Though his teammates may have had superior scoring numbers, Curry was the pilot that steered the Crimson offense; Harvard Coach Tommy Amaker routinely referred to him as the most important player on the team. The expected loss of Curry is exacerbated by the dearth of proven options at point guard. Of the returning players, Saunders may be the only one seeing time at the point, but he is more of a natural wing and struggled last season with handling the ball. This leaves the primary responsibility of filling Curry’s shoes to freshman Siyani Chambers and sophomore Alex Nesbitt, who only played three minutes all of last season. Teammates have praised Nesbitt’s skill set, but his size remains an issue, and he has yet to play in a meaningful game.
Chambers may end up starting, with Saunders at the two-guard. Chambers, a Minnesota native, led his high school team to a 4A state basketball championship in 2010 and 2011 but has never experienced Division I basketball.
With this short-handed roster, the likelihood that the Crimson repeats as Ivy League champs has dropped drastically. Originally the heavy favorites, Harvard now has to contend with an always dangerous Princeton team that returns its star player Ian Hummer and a much-improved Columbia squad.
A curious implication of this situation is the prospect of the Crimson’s 2013-14 roster. Should Casey and Curry both return to Harvard following their leaves of absence, they would rejoin all of the projected contributors from this year’s team, except Webster. Also bolstering next year’s team will be one of the strongest recruiting classes in the Crimson’s history, led by Edosomwan. Coupled with the development of the young players on this year’s team, the collection of talent potentially amassing in Cambridge could outclass any of the achievements of the teams in recent years, including the NCAA Tournament berth of last season.
The upcoming season will certainly be a tough one to manage. Amaker and his staff have their work cut out for them as they try to cope with a highly altered personnel group after the fallout of Tuesday’s revelations.

Following a difficult 2011 season, the Harvard men’s soccer team’s 2012 campaign has not gotten off to a much better start, and things don’t get any easier from here for the Crimson.
Coming off a split with Michigan State and Southern Methodist in its first two home games of the year, Harvard (1-2-1) remains in Cambridge where it will face No. 4/3 Connecticut (4-0-1) tomorrow afternoon at Ohiri Field.
Last weekend, the Crimson won just its third game since November 2010 when it knocked off the Spartans, its first ever victory over a Big Ten opponent. In its subsequent contest, Harvard suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 double-overtime loss to the Mustangs despite a two-goal second half rally. Notably, both those games were played on the turf of Soldier’s Field Soccer Stadium, while tomorrow’s contest will take place on the grass of Ohiri Field.
“We train [at Ohiri] a lot,” junior midfielder Kyle Henderson said. “It’s a fine surface; it’s not going to make a difference.”
UConn also defeated Michigan State this season, in addition to wins over St. Francis, Dartmouth, and Washington—the latter two in extra time. The Huskies tied BU, 1-1, in its most recent contest and remains in the top five of both national polls.
“They are obviously a good team, but a lot of us have played them in the past and it’s always been a good game,” Henderson said. “So we are obviously looking forward to...competing with them. It is also our first time that we only have one game a weekend, so we can put a lot of our effort into it.”
Co-captain Scott Prozeller, sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi, and freshmen Jake Freeman and Oliver White have all tallied goals for the Crimson this season, while another pair of rookies—Evan Mendez and Joe Festa—has split the goaltending duties. Thus far, Mendez has been more effective, registering a 0.71 goals against average and an .833 save percentage. But Festa got the start against Southern Methodist after Mendez collected a red card when he prevented a shot by diving on the ball outside the goalie box against the Spartans.
Whoever is in net for Harvard will be tasked with stopping a UConn attack led by sophomore Allando Matheson and junior Mamadou Diouf, who have both scored a team-high two goals this year. Senior defenseman Max Wasserman paces the squad with two assists and was named to the Big East Honor Roll this week following his game-winning goal off a free kick against Washington.
Senior Carlos Alvarez, a 2011 NSCAA Second-Team All-American, has also registered a tally for Connecticut this year. As a freshman in 2009, Alvarez scored two goals and had an assist to help then-No. 17 UConn upset then-No. 6 Harvard in the squads’ last meeting in Cambridge.
To slow down the Huskies’ offensive attack, Kobayashi emphasized that the Crimson would have to take control of the flow of the game.
“We’ve got to play at our own rhythm, just play our style,” the forward said.
Doing so will be tough, as the prolific UConn offense has outshot opponents 72-45 on the season. Harvard has also outshot its opponents this year, albeit by a lesser margin of 59-50. But it has not always been able to turn those attempts into wins.
Trying to continue preventing the Crimson from doing so will be Andre Blake, UConn’s sophomore goalie who has played every minute in net this year. During that time, Blake has registered a 0.38 goals against average and has recorded a .875 save percentage—two statistics that place him 15th and 18th in the country, respectively.
Despite the keeper’s stellar performance thus far, Henderson said that the Crimson is confident in its ability to generate offensive chances against Blake and a strong UConn defense.
“Our work rate has been good in the last few games,” he explained. “That is really one of the only things you control on the field, and I think we’ve been really strong in that department.”
In the all-time series, Harvard is 8-14-5 against Connecticut. But in this year’s version of the contest, the Crimson is ready to take its shot at one of the nation’s elite squads.
“UConn is definitely one of the best teams, so we’re all very pumped and ready to go at them,” Kobayashi said. “We’re not scared at all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t long before Quinnipiac realized what Dayton had only two days before—that too many early opportunities given to the Harvard women’s soccer team could only lead to an early deficit for the Crimson’s opponents.
With three goals scored by three different players, Harvard’s (3-1-1) offensive onslaught continued on Wednesday night and gave the Bobcats (4-1-1) their first loss of the season, 3-0, at Quinnipiac Soccer Field.
“We went into the game knowing that Quinnipiac has a big winning mentality,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said. “They were undefeated on the season before today, so we knew that they knew how to win games, how to score goals, and how to not give up goals. We just went into it and knew that we were going to have to play strong, which we did.”
It was less than ten minutes into the match when the Crimson put its first point on the scoreboard, thanks to a direct pass from freshman defender Alika Keene to junior forward Elizabeth Weisman. Upon receiving the pass, Weisman quickly controlled the ball and shot it right into the back of the net. The goal was good for Weisman’s third point of the season and prompted Kanten to deem the junior “a big offensive power.”
Harvard continued to set the tempo for the rest of the first period, not only maintaining possession of the ball for a majority of the period but also outnumbering Quinnipiac’s shot attempts, 8-2.
Following halftime, the Crimson presented a change in goal, giving sophomore Cheta Emba her first chance to play thus far this season. Emba continued where Kanten left off and the classmates combined for 90 minutes with no goals scored.
“We’re really developing some good chemistry back there [in goal],” junior co-captain Peyton Johnson explained. “We’re solid from top to bottom, moving up the chart. You saw that today with the combination of Bethany starting and Cheta coming in and doing such a great job. We’re definitely building our confidence back there.”
With a shutout going in goal, Harvard’s offense did its best in the second half to blow the game open. And, due in large part to two consecutive goals by Crimson freshmen, it did.
The first of the set came at the 65:32 mark, when rookie forward Lauren Varela netted the first collegiate goal of her career on her second shot of the night. It happened only six minutes after she checked back into the game and was credited to her as unassisted. The next came just short of 21 minutes later, at 86:17, and was driven home by forward Emily Mosbacher after a setup by defender and co-captain Catherine Coppinger, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
“The two freshmen getting the first goals of their careers was really big,” Johnson said. “They both came off the bench and really put the defense under pressure and scored some really nice goals. The last goal of the night, Emily’s, assisted by [Coppinger] was awesome. It was just a really nice combination play.”
With the three goals scored in Tuesday’s game, Harvard has already matched last season’s tally of two games with three or more goals scored. The Crimson racked up six in its last two matches and 11 so far this season. Kanten attributes this offensive outpour to the team’s comfort with one another
.“I think as a team we’re starting to click a little more,” Kanten explained. “I think that as the season goes on, you get to know who you’re playing with better as well as each player’s tendencies. I think that through that we’re really beginning to come together as a team.”
Johnson echoed her teammates sentiments, emphasizing the contrast between the more recent games and those played at the very beginning of the season.
“Early on we scored a lot of set pieces,” Johnson said. “But I think now that we’re in our groove and have a few games under our belt, scoring in the run of a play has come easier for us and we’re getting creative which is really good to see. We were able to compete for the full 90 which might be a first for us thus far this season.”
With the offense on a steady incline on one side of the field and the defense consistent in the net on the other, the only thing Harvard is looking to do right now is keep building on their early successes.
“I think we’re getting better, but we’re definitely not where we want to be or where we need to go,” Kanten concluded. “It’s just going to be about keeping the positive energy going and continuing to build on the team unity that we have right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months of planning, the remodeled first floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles officially opened Wednesday night to cheers, public addresses, and free popcorn.
The renovation, which took place over the summer, is part of an Office of Student Life initiative to improve campus social space. New flat-screen TV’s, a pool table, sound systems, and even a Pac-Man machine were on display at the 6:30 p.m. grand opening ceremony.
“All of these renovations will and already have enhanced all of the student activities that are held in the SOCH,” said Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 in his remarks.
“The Event Hall no longer feels like an aquarium with the outside world looking in. Instead, the window shades, new dance flooring, speakers, and disco lights welcome you to Club SOCH.”
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who has been a major proponent and planner of the SOCH renovation, spoke about how the new space will promote social and intellectual activities alike.
“It is really important to recognize the mission of the SOCH, which is to provide for student organizations at Harvard to have a space to create their organizations and sustain them,” she said.
UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 served as a member of the focus group and said that the design team was “really good about implementing student feedback.”
She said students involved in the planning were invited to try out different options for furniture and that one student’s idea for an arcade led to the addition of the Pac-Man machine and an Xbox Kinect.
During Wednesday’s opening celebration the SOCH was serving its purpose as a hub for student activities, with treasurers from student groups attending a seminar on financial organization in the renovated Event Hall. The room can accommodate lectures for up to 300 people and late-night parties for up to 499 people. A display near the room’s entrance touted its new dance floor, ceiling-mounted subwoofers and speakers, and party lights that perform pre-programmed effects.
“It feels like a real place now,” said Humza S. Bokhari’ 14, who was in the remodeled space waiting for his training to begin.
“I think the changes that have been made make it a place that is more friendly, more exciting. It gives you one more reason to go to the Quad.”
One goal of the project was to make the SOCH a more flexible space, according to student planners. For example, what was once a reading room filled with study carrels has been turned into the Community Hall, featuring iLab-inspired, wheeled furniture. The room now accommodates meetings and retreats for up to 50 people. The old carrels have been moved up to the second and third floors.
Students said they appreciated the open feel and looked forward to hosting events in the building.
“I think that this is a wonderful student space,” said Julia B. Konrad ’13, Vice President of the Institute of Politics, as she waited for her seminar to begin.
“I love the playful atmosphere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The unclear timeline for decisions in this fall’s sweeping plagiarism investigation has raised questions about potential disparities in tuition fees for students asked to withdraw from Harvard mid-semester. If the College follows its standard procedures for calculating the bill of students who leave in the middle of the term, some accused students could face a steeper financial burden if their case is resolved later in the semester.
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, declined to comment Monday on whether the Administrative Board has issued decisions yet to any of the approximately 125 students under investigation for cheating in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Any student who withdrew from the College prior to Thursday would face no tuition charges and owe only several hundred dollars in room and service fees.
But beginning Thursday, students who leave school later in the semester—either voluntarily or not—are still required to pay partial tuition fees for the fall term. The ultimate portion of the nearly $19,000 tuition for the semester that each student owes could be dependent on when the Ad Board gets to his or her case.
According to a chart on the Ad Board website, students who are required to withdraw between Thursday and the end of the month will pay nearly $4,700 in tuition; students who leave between Oct. 1 and Oct. 28 will owe the College nearly $9,400 in tuition; and students who withdraw between Oct. 29 and Dec. 3 will see their tuition costs rise to $14,100.
The Crimson has previously reported that one student heard from Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison in a meeting that he could expect a decision by November at the latest.
With each passing day between now and Dec. 3, students who withdraw will also have to pay $46 per diem in room fees. During that same period, they will be required to pay a proportionate fraction of board fees for the semester, which total about $2,600, based on the number of days enrolled. These students will also be billed for a service fee, which would be nearly $300 for students who withdraw in September and rise to nearly $900 for those who leave in November.
Students on financial aid who are required or choose to withdraw will receive a proportionate fraction of their expected financial aid package based on the amount of time they were enrolled at the College.
This potential escalation in fees could encourage some students, especially those who are expecting the most extreme penalty, to voluntarily withdraw from the College before their case is reviewed. In an internal email obtained by The Crimson, Ellison wrote to his “Colleagues”—a group of recipients who one resident dean identified as others of the resident deans—that “the only folks that may want to really consider [a leave of absence] are those students who know that they cheated.”
Still, this potentially uneven financial burden on the many individuals entangled in an incident that occurred within the space of only a few days has been a source of concern among accused students.
“If one student gets [required to withdraw] in September and another gets [required to withdraw] in November, that’s a huge disparity in finances, and that’s not fair,” said one student under investigation, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson after asking not to be named in an academic dishonesty case.
That student expressed hope that Harvard would consider that financial disparity as the Ad Board resolves cases, perhaps by offering a waiver or refund to ensure that some students do not bear a larger financial burden than others.
Another student accused in the scandal wrote in an emailed statement that, because he is on nearly full financial aid, he is not worried about his tuition costs if he is required to take a year off. That student, who maintains his innocence, said that he could still incur costs associated with a later required withdrawal, including money lost on textbooks for courses that will not count and storage fees while he is away from Cambridge.
In contrast to the potentially uneven financial burden that accused students could face, no implicated students required to withdraw from the College during this semester will face academic repercussions for partially-completed courses taken this fall. Ellison said that even students asked to leave the College after the fifth Monday add-drop deadline will have this fall’s courses wiped from their transcripts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and the Krokodiloes have merged into a single entity known as The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, Andrew L. Farkas ’82 announced to members of the three groups at a meeting Monday evening in Farkas Hall.
Both the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Krokodiloes a capella group were founded at the headquarters of the Hasty Pudding Club, a social organization established in 1770. The new conglomerate will now extend Club membership to individuals in both groups.
The restructuring will place these three organizations under a single governing body. The new umbrella organization will be directed by Farkas, a former president of the Hasty Pudding Club, and two other alumni.
Members of the graduate advisory board of the Hasty Pudding Club and Hasty Pudding Theatricals also announced the change in a letter to alumni of all three groups. In the letter, the board wrote that the intention was to expand the Pudding’s activities to create a tight-knit community of graduates and undergraduates.
“We stand poised now to pursue a renaissance of our shared traditions, and to extend the Pudding’s recognition to new and exciting heights,” the letter read.
According to those who attended Monday’s meeting, Farkas said the move also signified a testament to the clubs’ history together and a desire to combine their social and theatrical causes.
Members of the new Institute said they are generally optimistic about the change and are looking forward to unifying the groups.
“There will be a lot of new faces, but we’re very excited about it,” said Ian T. Hassett ’15, a member of the social club.
“We all have the same mindset and spirit.”
Students also welcomed the increased level of interaction that will now occur between the three groups.
“I think this is an exciting opportunity to meet new people, both undergraduates and alumni,” said McKenna E. Kardish ’15, a member of the social club.
“We will be able to broaden our horizon and be more inclusive and open as a club.”
Though the groups now fall under the same umbrella organization, Justin S. Pereira ’13, a member of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, said he is not worried about any one group losing its sense of identity.
“Their individual identities will be kept intact just given that we all do different things,” Pereira said, adding that the change will actually connect the groups back to their roots.
Members of the Krokodiloes declined to comment.
Recently, the Pudding social club began renovating its space on 2 Garden Street and hired a full-time steward to keep the club in order, according to a set of club rules emailed to members of the Institute by the presidents of all three organizations. The rules for the club will also apply to members of the Theatricals and the Krokodiloes, who now have a say in which students are admitted into the Pudding social organization.
A donation to Harvard made by Farkas last year led to the re-naming of the New College Theatre, now called Farkas Hall. Farkas mandated that the lobby, which has remained unchanged since its erection in 1888, would be known as the “Hasty Pudding Lobby” and serve as a museum space for memorabilia of all three groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House reopened Wednesday after months of rebranding and renovations to its flagship location at 33 Dunster Street.
According to Lindsay Rotondi, deputy team leader for the rebranding initiative, John Harvard’s closed two months ago and subsequently embarked on extensive renovations and a rebranding campaign designed to streamline a previously cumbersome menu for drinks and food.
“We need a balance to both refresh and renew and to maintain the history,” said Michael S. McBride, general manager of John Harvard’s in Cambridge.
Centerplate, Inc., a concessions company based in South Carolina, acquired the John Harvard franchise about 18 months ago, prompting the decision to revamp and rebrand the flagship restaurant, Rotondi said.
For 20 years, the brewery has specialized in traditional food from colonial New England and Elizabethan England and claims to use recipes of John Harvard and William Shakespeare.
But after the rebranding initiative, the brewery’s chefs have added unique twists to their traditional comfort fare. Building on the restaurant’s origins as a brewery, John Harvard’s chefs have incorporated byproducts of the brewing process into dishes like their Spent Grain Pizzas. Dishes are around $10 to $12.
McBride said that the 20-year-old interior also “really needed to be renovated and updated.”
The new space now features a boosted sounds system, a new lighting scheme, eleven televisions, and space for live performances. Patrons can also see the two brewing tanks responsible for making John Harvard’s eight trademark beers, including the brewery’s mainstays–Demon DPA, Provision Ale, Pilgrims Porter–alongside seasonal brews.
During renovations, the management decided to preserve aspects of their previous decor, including the original wood pilings, warm brick walls, dark wood paneling, and the ironic stained glass windows that depict Richard Nixon, Humphrey Bogart, and others.
“We really wanted to preserve the historical feel,” McBride said. “There’s a lot of nostalgia here.”
Along the back wall, the restaurant now features a timeline that spans from 1560-1992 and depicts the trajectory of John Harvard’s association with the brewery.
The brewery lists John Harvard, whose legacy and library endowed Harvard University, as its namesake. According to McBride, Harvard, the grandson of an ale taster, grew up helping his father sell grain to local brewers and later moved to the New World. At one time, the University had a brewery associated with its campus, but the institution burned down, only to be reopened in 1992 as John Harvard’s Brewery & Ale House.
John Harvard’s now has six other locations in Rhode Island, New York, and Massachusetts and maintains a shop with John Harvard merchandise for patrons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael J. Sandel, the instructor for “Justice,” is recognized for his ability to capture the attention of his students. But when he announced in his first lecture that the course would introduce a Friday class this year, even his captivating cases on trolleys and torture could not stop roughly half of the 800 students from going back to their shopping lists to look at other course offerings.
While Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice” saw a sharp decrease from its usual student enrollment numbers, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” grew to become the second largest class in undergraduate enrollment. Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” remained the class with the highest undergraduate enrollment, with 715 College students.
Sandel, a government professor, said that once he announced the addition of a Friday lecture, the number of students in the class “immediately dropped.”
The new lectures are part of what Sandel called an “educational experiment” where class lectures are broadcasted to several universities abroad, creating a “global classroom” that he hopes will encourage discussions of justice “across cultures and national boundaries.”
“I don’t think this reflects any lack of enthusiasm for the ‘global classroom’ experiment, but rather an aversion to Friday classes,” he wrote in an email, as he could not be reached by phone.
This semester, 396 students enrolled for Justice, down from 797 in the fall of 2010.
CS50 increased by 20 percent from last fall, growth that CS50 instructor David J. Malan ’99 attributed to increasing interest from students specializing in the humanities, the life sciences, and the physical sciences.
“These are exciting times for computer science at Harvard, and we’re thrilled to have so many students with us this term,” Malan, who could not be reached by phone, wrote in an email.
“Trends in industry have certainly gotten students here and elsewhere all the more excited about computer science.”
This surge in students, however, is part of CS50’s steady climb in enrollees over the past few years. CS50 displayed a 32 percent rise in enrollees last fall, going from 478 undergraduates in 2010 to 579 in 2011.
Ec10 still remained the class with the most enrolled undergraduates, experiencing little variation in number of enrollees from last fall.
“Learning the basics of economics is essential for being an informed citizen, and it is a good foundation for many career paths,” wrote Mankiw in an email, as he could not be reached by phone.
“As long as students appreciate those facts, Ec10 will continue to be among the largest classes at Harvard.”
Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” collected 501 undergraduate enrollees, placing the class as the third most enrolled class.
The course’s teacher, Chinese history professor Michael Puett, said he attributes the course’s steady climb in enrollment to its rich texts and, he hoped, word of mouth.
Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking” saw the most dramatic increase in student enrollment, experiencing a 65 percent increase from last fall,
First offered in the fall of 2010, the course then had nearly 700 applicants and was forced to hold a lottery. Course instructor and physics professor David A. Weitz, said that he attributes the drop in 2011 enrollment to 171 undergraduates to the former perception that the class was difficult to get into, an impression that receded after the lottery was abolished.
“I’m happy,” Weitz said. “It’s going to be fun.”

"Centipede Hz,” Animal Collective’s ninth album, made its official debut less than a week ago, but a mere 24 hours after the album’s release, the experimental indie rockers dropped yet another new track—the marvelously titled “Crimson.” Though the word has many connotations, we at The Harvard Crimson suspect that they're actually paying tribute to the nation's oldest continuously published daily college newspaper—and not for the first time either. Read on for a list of songs in which we uncover all the sneaky ways in which Animal Collective has paid homage to the Harvard Crimson over the years.
"Who Could Win A Rabbit" from the Animal Collective album "Sung Tongs"
Lyrically, this track is about as impenetrable as a brick wall, yet  it's performed so exuberantly it exudes pure, manic joy. It's a feeling  that we invariably associate with our beloved broadsheet, and we're  certain that the boys in Animal Collective feel the same way—why else  would they open the track with a muddled voice yelling “newspapers,  newspapers?”
Did You See the Words from the album "Feels" 
Another song with lyrics that tend towards the opaque, but the title  tells the whole story; what words could they be referring to besides  those in the Crimson?
Take Pills from the Panda Bear album "Person Pitch" 
This is actually a solo track from AnCo stalwart Panda Bear, and as  such it's a bit of departure from the band’s usual style.  That doesn't  mean there's no Crimson influence; rather, “Take Pills,” with its  despairing view of anti-depressants and prescription drugs, must be a  salute to the numerous times that the Crimson has reported on the abuse  of Adderall.
Derek from Animal Collective's 2007 album "Strawberry Jam" 
 
In this bouncy song, the members of AnCo show their more critical  side, using most of the track's three-minute length to vaguely attack a  character named Derek. Such a position was no doubt informed by the  Crimson's frequent criticism of Derek Bok, the university's president from 1971 to 1991.
 
Leaf House from "Sung Tongs" 
Though Currier House's mascot is a tree rather than a leaf, it's  doubtful this track could refer to anything but Audrey Bruce's  namesake.  The inspiration becomes even more evident if one considers  how its jubilant tone aligns with the Crimson's praise for Currier's dining hall, housing, and house spirit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outside of the NHL and a few notable exceptions in the other major sports, Harvard fans don’t often get to see their school’s alumni compete in professional uniforms. This is especially true when it comes to Major League Baseball, where Harvard is perhaps better known for producing front office talent—like New York Mets VP of Player Development and Scouting Paul DePodesta ’95 or Cleveland Indians Director of Baseball Operations David Stearns ’07—than actual players. Indians pitcher Frank Herrmann ’06 is the Crimson’s lone regular presence on major league rosters.
So, unless you’re a Boston native (well at this point, even if you are a Boston native), it might seem difficult to get excited for tonight’s edition of the storied Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, a September matchup that would have generated significant buzz in Boston in years past. But while the Yankees are searching for a post-season berth, those hopes were dashed long ago for a Sox team that has been unloading talent and looking to rebuild.
But as fans of Harvard, whom should we throw our support behind? A glance at history and finances shows some parallels between Yankee greatness and Harvard prestige. Harvard has historically found itself near the top of most college rankings, a tradition it continued earlier this week as it tied Princeton atop US News and World Report’s annual rankings. The men in pinstripes have a noted track record themselves, having won 27 World Series titles, 16 more than the second-best St. Louis Cardinals.
And despite a hiccup or two in recent years, Harvard’s endowment (estimated to be $32 billion) trumps that of every other academic institution just as the Yankees’ near $200 million 2012 payroll towers over the rest of baseball. But supporters of both organizations know that what looks like limitless resources on paper don’t always translate cleanly to the real world. Yankees fans might ask how their astronomically high payroll buys a team that has played .500 baseball since July with the same frustration that Harvard students wonder what happened to hot breakfast, why there are no late-night dining hall hours, or how The Cataracs were recruited to headline Yardfest.
The forsaken Red Sox have some Crimson ties of their own. Ben Crockett ’02, a former Harvard pitcher and minor league prospect, is Director of Player Development for the Sox, a position that looks to be especially relevant with the attempts to rebuild. Local ties between the university and ball club run even deeper—Harvard played the Red Sox in an exhibition game in the first ever contest held at Fenway Park in 1912.
Unfortunately, it’s a terrible year to be a Sox fan, and even the most devout have struggled to stay on board. But life as a Goliath is far from carefree. As the Yankees’ recent stumble has demonstrated, failures are magnified when the standard is greatness. Those of us at Harvard who have paid any attention to the news in recent weeks can certainly relate to that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An air of confidence surrounds the members of Harvard’s revamped receiving corps. The unproven trio of juniors Andrew Berg and Ricky Zorn and sophomore Seitu Smith II say they’re ready to show Crimson fans and the Ivy League what they’re made of.
“I don’t want to say we’re better than last year’s receiving corps,” Smith says. “But our technique is sound, and we look really good right now.”
The Crimson graduated all three starting wide receivers after Harvard’s passing offense set a slew of program records. Adam Chrissis ’12 and Chris Lorditch ’11 litter the career record books, and Alex Sarkisian ’12 scored in six of 10 games last year. Smith’s 12 career receptions give him the most of any returning wide receiver.
“As far as accepting the challenge, we don’t see ourselves as new and upcoming and unproven,” Smith says. “We know what we’re capable of, and we’ve put in the work. Now it’s our chance to show what we can do.”
After a stellar freshman season returning kicks—he averaged almost 30 yards per return and took one to the house—Smith was named a preseason All-American by College Sports Madness. Smith’s speed and elusiveness are respected around the Ancient Eight, but less known are the talents of Zorn and Berg, who are getting a shot with the starting team after two years of nearly zero reps with the first squad.
“I think Ricky Zorn and [Andrew] Berg are really going to surprise people,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “And I think that’s the characteristic of a quality program. All of a sudden you got two juniors that nobody’s ever heard of—really have never played a snap—and these guys can really play.”
Much of the credit for the rapid rise of the Crimson’s new wideouts can be attributed to new wide receivers coach Joe Villapiano and a summer spent in Cambridge working out with senior quarterback Colton Chapple.
Villapiano, who spent the last four seasons working with the running backs, emphasized running crisp routes and high attention to detail in the film room—both of which have proven beneficial to the group’s progress.
“I just think [Villapiano’s] been an incredible asset,” Berg says. “He’s always finding little things on film that he’s made us better at. I would give all the credit [for our route running] to him.”
While Berg and Smith work to polish their skills, Zorn has had to learn an entirely new position. A 5A all-state high school quarterback from Texas, Zorn transitioned to cornerback his freshman year, then injured his shoulder and eventually wound up at wide receiver.
“I’ve really had to persevere through some tough times, especially with [a] shoulder injury freshman year,” Zorn says. “Now it’s just fun to be out there and playing football again. It’s really just a joy and a blessing.”
Though Chapple enters the season as the Crimson’s starter for the first time, he is far from an unknown talent. In four starts in the stead of injured starter Collier Winters ’11, Chapple threw for 918 yards and 12 touchdowns. But his time practicing with the second team last year means the transition to a new group of receivers will be less volatile than one may otherwise think.
“Colton’s a great leader,” Berg said. “I think, even last year, we built up a pretty good rapport because I was a [second-team] receiver and he was a [second-team] quarterback, so there’s definitely a history there between us.”
Members of the offense made an effort to stay in Cambridge over the summer in order to stay in shape and foster chemistry. Three times a week for eight weeks, Chapple and his receivers met up to throw the ball, giving everyone a level of familiarity that should mitigate the problems usually associated with newcomers in an offensive system.
“I knew that they were talented; I knew they were good enough to play. It’s just they never had the opportunity,” Chapple says. “They’re new coming to the scene, so they’ll be able to catch a lot of people by surprise. [But] there’s no dip at all in the talent level.”

Junot Díaz, author of  “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao” and “Drown,” meets me in front of the Harvard Bookstore. It’s 9 a.m. on a Friday, and the early September humidity is just beginning to spike. Díaz is wearing a mottled red t-shirt, dark grey jeans, running shoes, and a Boston Red Sox cap. He kisses me on both cheeks when we meet. Recovering from back surgery, Díaz finds sitting almost impossible so we begin walking down Bow Street towards the Charles River.
Fifteen Minutes: You did an interview with The New York Times recently and talked about many of your favorite books. It’s an impressive list—how do you find time to read all of those authors?
 Junot Díaz: You have to understand: It’s what I do. When something is really important to you, I think you’re always looking for an excuse. I find reading more important to me than almost anything, including my writing. I consider myself a reader way more than I consider myself a writer. Perhaps what might have struck anybody about that interview was that this quantity of reading is more emblematic of the way I organize my life than anything.
FM: Did you read anything before we met this morning?
JD: Before I came here I read a chapter of a book on invasive species while I had my damn oatmeal, and I said, “I could have my fucking oatmeal and just chill. Or, I could put in 25 pages.” And so 25 pages are done. The book will be done by this evening because I sort of use these still, interstitial moments to burn through them. My favorite line of the chapter was the last line: “It is unlikely that anyone will ever again enter New Zealand carrying a red deer.”
FM: There’s one line that really struck me from a short story you wrote titled “The Cheater’s Guide to Love.” The line was: “The half-life of love is forever.” Can you explain that to me?
JD: I think you discover something—perhaps some of us discover it young, perhaps some of us discover it much older. You can get over a person romantically and never fall out of love with them. As a young person I had no idea that that was possible. I always thought that eventually a relationship would come to end, and your imaginary would find in time surcease. But I think when you really fall in love, there seems to be something permanent that happens to you.
FM: What do you think is that permanent change?
JD: Perhaps whatever insight the story was making is not particularly axiomatic. Perhaps it’s just something idiosyncratic about me. But it certainly feels that way when I stand and look back at all my relationships, beginning to understand that there are a few of them that never seem to diminish, neither in my mind nor my heart. You just manage them.
FM: A powerful idea.
 JD: Love reveals us. Profoundly and unnervingly, love reveals us. I think this is something that can often be a source of comfort and dismay. Most of us are not used to being naked. And I can’t speak to the world, but that first time you disrobe—the first time you disrobe before someone you care about—shrinks in comparison to the first time you begin to unveil your internal self. What I think of the stories that I was overwhelmed by growing up, that astonished me growing up, I think they always drew upon that notion of how we are revealed in love.
FM: When did love stories first begin to captivate you?
JD: I was always one of those kids who was aware from an early age that there was a narrative partition along gender lines. I was aware that love stories were supposedly the bailiwick of girls, and adventure stories were supposedly the bailiwick of boys. Now, we know fundamentally that this is a lie. We also know that these kind of hierarchical dichotomies do a lot of oppressive ideological work. So as a kid I was always attracted to stories that I was told were somehow not pertinent to me.
FM: What were some of your favorite love stories growing up?
 JD: So of course you know, standard English reader, the towering work of both a fictional bildungsroman, but also one of the great love stories of our language: “Jane Eyre.” There was also something far nerdier, but that came up at the same time. Most people never imagine children’s cartoons to have really good stories about love that are sophisticated and complex. And there was when I was growing up this anime that they were showing on TV. And I was a kid, man. This anime was called “Robotech.”
FM: What did the characters from these stories teach you?
 JD: Sometimes the right choice is also the hardest choice. Often, most of us choose for safety. I think it is easier to go to Mordor bearing the ring of the enemy than to advance into the unknown wilderness of another person’s heart.
FM: Are most of the stories in your new collection “This is How You Lose Her” about love in some way?
JD: Love and its consequences. It’s really a book about the rise and fall of a Dominican male slut. How did the boy learn to be a male slut, or at least this particular boy? How he is formed, and how that formation undoes him in the end. Because one must reflect that many of the messages we labored under were piercingly contradictory.
FM: How so?
JD: On the one hand, we’re told that the sort of proof and excellence of a man is measured by how many girls he can get, by his lack of vulnerability, by his indifference and often his hostility towards what would be considered traditional women’s arenas: domesticity, love, familial bonds, nurturing, family. And then there’s the other side which is: Who the fuck can be whole, who the fuck can be human without intimacy, without encountering that profound terror that we call love? On the one hand, you’re being told that that shit doesn’t mean shit. That that shit is shit. And on the other hand, your heart is dying for it. And it’s not as if boys are victims. Boys, believe me, profit quite well from the patriarchal, heteronormative arrangement. But, on the other hand, there clearly is a price to be paid for being a loyal boy. I think it’s really, really interesting how we doubled down on our bullshit because we didn’t have anywhere else to go. If I get more girls, maybe I’ll feel better. If I’m more of a masculine prick, maybe I’ll feel better. Maybe you just dig yourself deeper into a hole.
FM: How did you begin to dig yourself out of this masculine hole?
JD: I’m an artist. I kind of was already vulnerable to vulnerability. And I had fucking awesome women in my life. I went to Rutgers, and it was the best time of my life. I was such a moronic fool. I still remember once saying right at the beginning of my tenure at Rutgers, raising my hand and asking our teacher, an avowed and passionate feminist, why we were reading so many women. The beatdown from my female classmates was thorough, sustained, and merciless. It was fucking great. I can still hear the blows in my head from their genius. And yet, I think that without those blows I would never have become an artist. But, man, what a struggle with self. I was a moron for a very long time. It’s like being an asshole—if the show only runs five seasons, being an asshole for four and a half.
FM: So you don’t consider yourself an asshole anymore?
JD: Oh, of course I do. That never goes away. Come on, one doesn’t let oneself off the hook that easily. I think that it’s not the situation where one is transformed, where one is instantly converted and the conversion sticks. The truth is that you manage that shit. But that shit doesn’t fucking go away—that’s why I think it’s sort of dishonest when dudes are like, “I’m a feminist.” I’m not certain if, given all the training we’re given, men can be feminists. I believe myself a feminist ally, but a feminist? I think it would be possible only when we have the matriarchal revolution we’re all dreaming for.
FM: Do you think there will be a matriarchal revolution?
JD: Well, I mean, what the fuck are we around for if there’s no hope for that? Do you want to see this shit go on for another fucking 40,000 years? Look at this fucking nonsense. I mean, honestly. My shit isn’t that somehow women are transhuman, that their essence is morally, ethically superior. My thing is, “Okay motherfuckers, we’ve been at this game now 40,000-plus years depending on how you rank Homo sapien civilization.” I think it’s time for a time out. For real. Dudes could use a 10,000-year time out, minimum.
We cross Mass Ave., halfway between Harvard and Central Squares, then wander up Harvard Street. Díaz lives a handful of blocks away.
FM: Why do you live part-time in Harlem and part-time in Cambridge?
JD: New York is home in ways few places are. I feel like I have Jersey and the Dominican Republic, and they come together in New York City because New York has about a million Dominican immigrants. When I want to get midway to Santo Domingo, I’m in upper Manhattan, so that’s where I live.
FM: So why the Red Sox hat?
JD: I’m a Mets fan, so there’s no contradiction. And I’m Dominican. And you gotta remember that the Boston Red Sox, for a long time, has been the second Dominican national team. The only reason the Red Sox won their rings was because of fucking Pedro, was because of Manny, was because of D. Ortiz. And those are all Dominican players. So we, as a sort of a national identity, were rooting for these boys because they were our boys. They were the height of our athletic prowess. But no, I’m a Mets fan, and fucking the Mets, man. The Mets. You want to talk about a fucking eternal battle with failure? There you go.
