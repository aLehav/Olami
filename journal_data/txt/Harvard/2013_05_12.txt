After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Public Health Department and Harvard University Health Services are urging a limited number of students and faculty to undergo tuberculosis tests after a member of the Harvard community recently tested positive for the infection.
Students and faculty in at least two undergraduate courses—Molecular and Cellular Biology 56: ”Physical Biochemistry: Understanding Macromolecular Machines” and Physics 15b: “Introductory Electromagnetism”—were contacted in late April by the Cambridge Public Health Department, according to Jonathan A. Marks ’15, a student enrolled in both classes.
“The Cambridge Public Health Department has been working with the Harvard University Infection Control nurses to identify people at greatest risk of TB infection/disease, and to prevent further TB disease,” wrote Joanne Ferraro of the CPHD in an email to at-risk students obtained by the Crimson.
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs and can be spread through the air. Although sometimes lethal, tuberculosis is normally treated with a course of antibiotics.
In a statement released Friday evening, Harvard University Health Services confirmed the case but emphasized the disease’s low transmission risk.
“TB is not highly contagious and therefore the risk to those who have been in contact with the affected person is low. As is practice, Harvard University Health Services notified the Cambridge Public Health Department, which alerted those who may have come into contact with the affected person and encouraged those people to be tested,” wrote UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.
Students and faculty considered at-risk for infection have been advised by the Cambridge Public Health Department to immediately undergo tuberculin skin tests. In addition, since infected individuals may take up to twelve weeks to test positive, at-risk individuals will have to retest by mid-July, according to emails sent to students.
Tuberculosis was last reported on Harvard’s campus in 2010, when one Harvard undergraduate tested positive for the infection. Students and faculty in close contact with the individual were also asked to undergo TB testing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics announced Thursday the creation and sponsorship of the John C. Culver Institute of Politics Scholarship, which will be awarded annually to fund the tuition and mandatory fees for two-year graduate study at the Harvard Kennedy School. The first Culver Scholars will enroll at the Kennedy School for the 2014-2015 academic year.
Those awarded the scholarship—named in honor of John C. Culver ’54, IOP’s Senior Advisory Committee chair emeritus—must be graduates of either Harvard College or one of the IOP’s 24 consortium colleges. All applicants must also show their involvement with the IOP or, if they did not attend Harvard, their respective consortium college’s political engagement efforts.
“It is fitting that this scholarship at [the] Harvard Kennedy School bears the name of Senator John Culver, whose intelligence, integrity, and outstanding service to our nation are an inspiration,” Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 said in a press release.
Kennedy, who championed the establishment of the scholarship, is the IOP Senior Advisory Committee chair, a position Culver held for 14 years.
“We hope that Culver Scholars will be motivated by his extraordinary example in the years to come,” she added.
Prior to his involvement at the IOP, Culver pursued distinguished political and military careers. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps before being elected congressman for Iowa’s second congressional district in 1964, a seat he held for five terms. In 1974, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and served until 1980.
Besides his work with the Senior Advisory Committee, Culver also served as the interim director of the IOP from 2010 to 2011 before current director C. M. Tray Grayson ’94 was appointed in 2011.
“John Culver’s dedication to the Institute of Politics has helped us achieve excellence and become a model for similar institutions nationwide,” Grayson said of his predecessor in a press release. “We are very proud to offer this scholarship in his name.”
The scholarship named in his honor will be awarded to students who are not only involved in civic engagement efforts, but also display academic excellence, commitment to public service, and leadership experience.
Preference in selecting Culver Scholars will be given to applicants who were involved with their respective college’s National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement affiliate organization. Launched by the IOP in 2003, the National Campaign is active at each of the 24 consortium colleges from which applicants must have graduated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 21 Harvard men’s tennis team’s strong season drew to a close on Saturday when it fell, 4-1, to No. 10 Mississippi State in the second round of the 2013 NCAA Men’s Tennis Tournament.
After a 4-0 trouncing of No. 63 Samford (15-10) in the first round on Friday, the Crimson (19-6) came up short against the Bulldogs (18-9) on Mississippi State’s home courts. This year marks the second straight season that Harvard has advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament. Last season, the Crimson defeated Virginia Tech before falling to Florida in the second round.
Although Harvard reached the same stage of the tournament as last year, the team feels that it made substantial progress in tournament play this year, according to sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri.
“Obviously, we’re a little disappointed with the final result,” Chaudhuri said. “But last year we were in a similar situation, and Florida really took it to us. This year, we won the doubles point against Mississippi State and really had a chance in singles, and showed some good improvement.”
MISSISSIPPI STATE 4, HARVARD 1
On Saturday, the Crimson showed off its strength in doubles, but had to contend with rain delays and adverse conditions before falling, 4-1.
In doubles, the third team of freshman Kelvin Lam and sophomore Alex Steinroeder broke serve at 5-4 en route to an 8-5 win. Although senior co-captain Andy Nguyen and freshman Nicky Hu faltered on the second court, the No. 1 team of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen took down the 13th-ranked doubles team in the nation in Mississippi State’s Malte Stropp and Jordan Angus.
The duo’s 8-6 win secured the doubles point for Harvard for the 14th time in 15 matches, but the Crimson could not convert the early 1-0 advantage into a victory after rain delayed the start of singles play.
“Normally, the momentum would be going our way because the home team was rattled,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “But then it started to rain, which gave them time to sort themselves out instead of having that emotional gut check. They had time to regroup.”
The match was delayed again after a few games of singles, and the Bulldogs came out firing en route to taking the first set in all six singles matches. But Denis Nguyen, Steinroeder, and Nicky Hu clawed their way back to win the second sets, giving Harvard a shot to win.
But Steinroeder fell to the Bulldogs’ Jordan Angus in the decisive third set, 6-3. Then Chaudhuri went down on the second court, Nicholas Mahlangu lost at No. 6, and Andy Nguyen was defeated on the fourth court, all in straight sets, to give Mississippi State the fourth point and the match.
“They were the better team today,” Chaudhuri said. “There’s a reason they’re ranked 10th in the country, and they showed us today. But we were close, and were the better team in doubles.”
HARVARD 4, SAMFORD 0
On Friday, the weather was not in prime form, but Harvard was. Despite the match being moved indoors following a rain delay, the Crimson was not deterred, taking four straight singles matches en route to a 4-0 victory over the Bulldogs from Samford.
Having moved indoors, play was confined to two courts. This change in venue prompted a departure from regular match format and the postponement of doubles play in favor of side-by-side singles play.
Denis Nguyen took the first court, and Chaudhuri began play on the second. Nguyen defeated Samford’s Zac Dunkle 6-3, 6-4, to give the Crimson the first point of the match. Chaudhuri took a three-setter to make the score 2-0.
Andy Nguyen silenced opponent Fares Kilani, who had gone undefeated in April, 6-1, 6-2. Sophomore Alex Steinroeder, playing at No. 4, clinched the match for Harvard with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Samfords Alex Sajonz.
The Crimson finished its second consecutive Ivy title-winning season by upping its all-time NCAA Tournament record to 15-22. It also said goodbye to Andy Nguyen, the team’s lone senior.
“Andy has been such a force for our team, and he had a huge senior year,” Chaudhuri said. “He ends on a high note winning Ivies and making the second round of NCAAs.”
“Everyone on the team should be proud for what has become a really great season,” Chaudhuri added. “We were slightly disappointed on Saturday, but we know that we have the talent to be a top-caliber team and national competitor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team wrapped up its season on Saturday with a 20th-place finish at the NCAA West Regionals in Stanford, Calif.
The Ivy League champions entered the national championship qualifier seeded 20th in a field of 24 schools. The Crimson matched expectations over the three-day event to finish 61-over-par with 913 strokes.
“I was really pleased with our team total; our scoring improved each day,” said junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor. “Everyone had their good and bad days for sure, but overall, they tried their best.”
Sophomore Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, led Harvard with an 11-over performance to tie for 50th among 126 individual entrants on the par-71 course. Hu finished just one stroke behind to place 55th, while freshman Christine Lin (+17), classmate Courtney Hooton (+21) and sophomore Tiffany Lim finished 77th, 96th, and 123rd, respectively.
A strong final day allowed No. 1 University of Southern California (+7) to take the team title. The Trojans led the field on Saturday with a round-best 280 strokes to edge No. 14 Purdue (+8) by a single stroke. USC freshman Annie Park and Purdue senior Paula Reto finished the weekend at seven-under to share the individual title.
In addition to Southern California and Purdue, No. 9 Vanderbilt (+17), South Carolina (+22), No. 12 Stanford (+24), No. 8 Arizona (+37), Oregon (+37) and San Jose State (+37) posted top-eight team finishes to qualify for next week’s NCAA Championships in Athens, Ga.
Nelsen produced a team-best 72 in the final round of the tournament Saturday after shooting 73 on Thursday and 79 on Friday. A painful foot injury had limited the sophomore’s ability to practice for much of the season, but an effective cortisone shot provided a boost as she headed into the final tournament of the spring.
“In terms of Brenna, it’s actually really incredible how she played,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “She has practiced less this spring than anyone on the team since I’ve been coaching the team… She got another cortisone shot last week, and it actually worked pretty well, so it shows that when she’s not pain free but lower on the pain scale she’s capable of playing really, really well.”
Hu, who has also struggled with an injury this season, tied Nelsen for the Crimson’s best first round score on Thursday before shooting 76 in each of the final two rounds. The junior was satisfied with her performance but acknowledged room for improvement.
“I was happy with my game the whole week,” Hu said. “Just at the end, it just came down to my birdie putts that weren’t going in.”
Less than two weeks removed from her individual runner-up finish at the Ivy League Championships, Lin struggled to pick up where she left off with an 81 on the first day of competition. But the freshman bounced back on the final two rounds, shooting 74 on Friday and 75 on Saturday with a team-high eight birdies.
“She definitely wanted to score better,” Rhoads said. “But I would say that she was playing quite well; her game was in a very similar place as it was for Ivies,”
Hooton opened with an 82 on the first day before matching Hu stroke-for-stroke Friday and Saturday with a pair of 76’s. Lim turned in her best round of the tournament on Saturday with 80 strokes after shooting 85 on Thursday and 87 on Friday.
Having competed in the Stanford Intercollegiate in late October, Harvard was familiar with the course. But the Crimson nevertheless had to adjust to changes in hole-length intended to increase the course’s difficulty for the regional tournament.
“Even though it was longer, it was still fair, so if you hit good shots, you’d still be able to score,” Hu said. “But it was a little tougher for sure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the 41 current varsity sports at Harvard—the largest number in the country—men’s squash has won the most national championships by far, with 30, all of which have come in the second half of the twentieth century.
What might surprise some Crimson fans is that second on the list, tied with women’s squash with 14 national titles, is one of the nation’s most popular collegiate sports—men’s lacrosse.
As the game looks to crown a new national champion at the end of the month, the Crimson is on the outside looking in at the bracket that will decide the year’s winner for the 38th time in the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Tournament’s 43-year existence, never having advanced past the quarterfinals.
But in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Harvard was a men’s lacrosse powerhouse, winning all of its 14 championships before 1916.
Even students at the time were unaware of what Winthrop Nightingale, class of 1915, called the school’s “supremacy in this branch of athletics.”
“The majority of men in College today do not yet realize that the lacrosse team offers more to the individual than any other athletic team representing the University,” Nightingale wrote in a 1915 letter to The Crimson.
Indeed, during Nightingale’s era, lacrosse was just beginning to become popular, but as it did so, Harvard excelled.
The sport had its intercollegiate origins in New York City in the fall of 1877, when NYU played Manhattan College in the first game ever. Harvard, along with NYU, was the first university to join the United States National Amateur Lacrosse Association in 1879. Two years later, those two schools, along with Princeton and Columbia, competed in the first intercollegiate tournament sponsored by the association, and the Crimson beat the Tigers to win its first championship.
Around the turn of the century, a number of innovations greatly improved the game. Nets were fastened to the goalposts in 1897, and a year later, shorter, lighter sticks gave rise to a short passing game. In 1905, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League was founded with Northern and Southern Divisions, and the new league brought with it a number of innovations as well, including the implementation of 35-minute halves.
Yet despite all these changes to the game’s regulations, Harvard continued to win. The Crimson earned the first USILL national title in 1905 and then garnered six straight titles from 1908-1913.
One hundred years ago today, Harvard defeated Cornell, 5-1, to win the last of that string of championships and preserve its spot atop the collegiate lacrosse world.
PRESEASON PREPARATION
The five-time defending national champions began preparing for its quest for a sixth straight title two months before the season was set to get underway. As an article in The Crimson noted, “the hard games at the beginning of the schedule, especially those during the southern trip early in April, necessitate an immediate start.”
On a frigid February 17th night—temperatures had hit a low of 27 degrees Fahrenheit during the day—a meeting was held in Thayer Common Room for all those interested in pursuing a spot on the team. Following that gathering was another discussion about the formation of a Boston Lacrosse Club, which would have the dual purpose of providing both a league in which Harvard graduates could continue their careers and an additional means of practice for the undergraduate squad.
Apparently, turnout was low, as two weeks later another meeting was held in Sever Hall.
“One of the objects [of the meeting] is to get out as many new men as possible, and show them some of the advantages lacrosse offers to men who, on account of afternoon work, are unable to go out for other teams,” an announcement explained. “It is mainly to accommodate these men that practice begins at 4.30 o'clock in the afternoon.”
The notice also pointed to the program’s recent achievements, writing that “the records of the [lacrosse] teams during the last ten years speak for themselves and there is no reason why more men should not take up the sport.”
In order to draw students to the event, guest speakers included Charles Marsters, a former president of the Intercollegiate Lacrosse League who had graduated from Harvard in 1907, as well as Fred Alexander, Phillip Nash, and Paul Gustafson, the respective captains of the 1910, 1911, and 1912 national champion squads.
At the meeting, William Garcelon, class of 1895, spoke of lacrosse’s “great value as a sport in which any style or build of athlete can win success.” Marsters “discussed the better and cleaner aspect of the game in recent years,” Alexander noted the program’s past triumphs, and Gustafson “devoted his attention chiefly to the practical side of the game.”
“Every man must apply himself diligently to learning the rudiments of the game, and freshman candidates particularly should devote themselves to securing a mastery of the rules,” said Gustafson, who also discussed the Boston Lacrosse Club he had recently helped form.
About fifty prospective players attended the meeting in an effort to join a squad that was returning a wealth of talent.
“There are seven regular players back from last year’s team and also a number of substitutes who will form a splendid nucleus for this year's twelve,” The Crimson wrote. “In view of the large number of new candidates, prospects for a successful season are very bright.”
Tryouts began the following afternoon at Soldiers Field, and arrangements were made so that the lacrosse players could use the baseball cage on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays after 7 p.m. Such night practices were new to the team in 1913, and according to a March 5 report in The Crimson, they “proved so far highly successful.”
“The special object of [the practices is] to give the men a chance to learn and improve their stick-work and formations, points which are usually too much neglected until the season actually begins,” The Crimson explained.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, practices were held indoors “with the object of getting the men in [physical] condition,” and the freshman candidates for the team were also given one night a week to practice.
Interclass games were held on March 26, 27, and 28 to help finalize the roster. On March 29, the Crimson played an exhibition against the Boston Lacrosse Club, founded by Marsters and Gustafson. The club, composed of former Harvard players, defeated the Crimson, 2-0, in a game the undergraduates largely used as a final tryout.
Marsters would later become a prominent ambassador of the sport, serving as president of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association from 1909 to 1910 and again from 1917 to 1918. He was inducted into the Collegiate Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1957.
SOUTHERN COMFORT
Returning to the team from the 1912 championship squad were second defense Raymond Simmons, the team’s captain and a South Boston native, as well as goaltender Nathan Lincoln, center James Foristall, centerpoint William MacKenzie, in home Ralph Beatley, utility player Joseph White—all class of 1913—and out home Frederic Abbe, class of 1914.
Though the contract of Crimson coach Arthur Warwick was not yet finalized, in March The Crimson noted the team was not worried about his return.
“The officials of the lacrosse team are in communication with Coach Warwick, who has coached the University’s championship twelves for two years,” the paper read. “Though he has not yet signed a contract, he has signified his intention of returning, and it is hoped that he will be on hand for the early games, if not before.”
But Warwick, the captain and manager of a team in Toronto, never returned that season, leaving Gustafson at the helm of the squad.
Once the rookie coach had finalized his roster, the team got set to begin its championship defense.
“Though this year’s schedule is considered an unusually difficult one, there is no reason to believe that the team will fall to uphold its enviable past record,” The Crimson wrote in a season preview.
Harvard began its schedule with a “southern” roadtrip, playing Penn at Franklin Field on April 12 and the Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland at College Park) on April 14.
The Quakers and Terrapins were no match for the Crimson, which won by respective scores of 10-0 and 12-0. In the latter contest, drizzling rain created a slippery field with three inches of mud, but the weather did nothing to stop a potent Crimson offense.
“The Aggies were ragged on attack and Harvard outclassed them in teamwork,” read the next day’s Washington Herald. “The college boys [from Maryland] put up a game fight against apparently big odds.”
Next up was an 8-3 exhibition victory over Navy in Annapolis, a win that, according to the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine, “was considered especially encouraging as the opponents were heavy football men who were playing lacrosse in order to get into shape for football in the fall.”
But during the contest, Harvard lost Mackenzie, Simmons, and third attack Percival Brundage to injury, leaving the team in “crippled condition” for its next exhibition contest against Johns Hopkins.
A perennial championship contender, the Blue Jays had also won many of the era’s titles, including at least a share in every year from 1906 to 1909 and again in 1911. And according to the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine, in 1913 Johns Hopkins was considered to have “the best team which that University has supported for years.”
Twelve months prior, Harvard had knocked off the Blue Jays, the Southern Division champions, to win the 1912 national championship despite losing a 5-4 contest in Baltimore during the regular season.
At the 2013 preseason meeting in Sever, Marsters had noted that “Harvard teams had now attained a standard of excellence where the defeat of Johns Hopkins was most to be desired and worked for.” But during the teams’ 1913 exhibition, on the first sunny day of the road trip, the Crimson showed it was not quite at John Hopkins’ level, falling, 8-3.
Luckily for Harvard, the scrimmage did not count, and it remained undefeated after its early season road trip.
WILD, WILD WEST
After a week on the road, the Crimson returned to Cambridge and played its first—and only—home contest of the season against Stevens Institute of Technology on April 27 at Soldiers Field.
“The University team is in good condition for the game, and has developed well as a result of practice since the southern trip,” wrote The Crimson before the contest, to which tickets cost fifty cents.
Though Harvard allowed its first goals of the season in the match, it nonetheless cruised to a 9-3 victory.
“The University offence [sic] played well together,” The Crimson wrote. “Nightingale and Foristall displayed clever stick work, while [first attack Putnam] Eaton’s shots at the goal were especially accurate. The defence [sic], though weakened by injuries on the southern trip, held the Stevens forward line well, [with point Fred] Churchill doing particularly good work in spoiling many attempts to score.”
Two weeks later, Harvard departed on its “western” road trip, with games scheduled in upstate New York against Hobart on May 10 and Cornell on May 12.
“As the team has been playing very well the chances for winning the game, and probably the league championship, are good,” The Crimson claimed before the contest with the Deacons (now known as the Statesmen).
The prediction would prove prescient, as Harvard—thanks to two goals each from second attack Nightingale, third attack Brundage, and third defense Percy Catton—won what its student paper called a “brilliant” match against Hobart by a score of 7-3.
“Throughout the game [Harvard] showed better speed and stick-work,” The Crimson noted, adding that “Lincoln played an excellent game in goal.”
Two days later, the Crimson travelled to Ithaca to play the Big Red with the ILL Northern Division Championship on the line. Tickets to the contest, played at Percy Field, cost 25 cents.
The day of the game, The Crimson predicted that “the University will have to work hard to win for Cornell has a strong team.” The Cornell Daily Sun was equally complementary of the Crimson, noting that “the Harvard lacrosse team promises a hard match.”
That proved to be the case for the Big Red, as the visitors were able to come out on top in what both The Sun and The Crimson deemed a “fast and clean game.” Harvard’s 5-1 victory clinched the program’s seventh ILL championship in ten years.
“Both teams showed lots of fight throughout the entire game, and the brilliant defensive work of the Crimson goalkeepers swayed the score in favor of the victors,” wrote The Sun. “Cornell’s fast forwards were unable to keep the ball within the visitors’ territory during the better part of the game, but only succeeded in getting one shot by Harvard’s goal tender, Lincoln.”
On offense, Brundage turned in a strong performance, registering a hat trick, while Catton tallied the Crimson’s other two scores.
“The victory over Cornell was especially credible and was accomplished only by a very hard fight in which Lincoln at goal figured prominently,” wrote the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine.
THAT’S A WRAP
With another Northern Division championship in tow, Harvard offered to play Johns Hopkins, the Southern Division champions, for the national title, as the two teams had done a year prior.
An “important lacrosse practice” was held on May 15 so that the Crimson would be in “good condition” against the Blue Jays if the latter consented to play for the title. But Johns Hopkins was unable to participate, resulting in a split national championship.
The Crimson thus played just one more game, on May 20—Memorial Day—when it traveled to Hoboken, N.J. for a rematch with the Ducks. Before the match, The Crimson warned fans that the contest might be more competitive than the first meeting between the two squads.
“Since...the University team won the championship, they have had very little practice, while Stevens has been playing regularly,” the paper wrote. “Owing to this fact the game should be close and the result is extremely doubtful.”
Yet behind strong games from Foristall, MacKenzie, and Simmons, the Crimson was able to collect a 7-2 victory to finish the year a perfect 6-0.
A month after the season, on June 7, a celebratory dinner was held at the Hotel Brunswick in Boston. Brundage was elected the following year’s captain, while a number of players won letters.
Despite the return of Warwick to the helm, the Crimson would finish just 3-3 in 1914 following the loss of a number of key contributors. But Harvard would put together a championship performance one more time in 1915, when it won its final national title.
Following graduation, the 1913 team’s key players went on to careers in varied fields, including Catton, who became the Crimson’s head coach in 1921.
Simmons became a metallurgist in Gary, Ind., while MacKenzie did the same in Canton, Ohio. Lincoln became a high school teacher in Middletown, Conn., while Beatley taught math in New York City. Eaton worked in commercial administration in London, Churchill became a secretary at an engineering corporation in Boston, Nightingale worked in educational administration at Northeastern University, White went to Harvard Medical School, Brundage became an accountant in Westfield, N.J., and Abbe joined the army before becoming an investment banker in Boston.
Though each player went his own distinctive way after leaving the gates of Harvard Yard, they all shared a special bond.
One hundred years ago to date, after completing what the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine deemed a “remarkable season,” each of them was crowned a champion.
