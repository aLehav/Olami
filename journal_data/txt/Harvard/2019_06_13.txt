After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Adele Lim is a writer and producer for film and television, whose credits include co-writing the screenplay for “Crazy Rich Asians,” adapted from Kevin Kwan’s novel. She has also worked on several primetime TV dramas including “One Tree Hill,” “Private Practice, and “Lethal Weapon.” Lim is currently working on the screenplay for a Disney animated feature. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Lim to discuss representation in “Crazy Rich Asians” and Asian stories in mainstream media.
The Harvard Crimson: While working on “Crazy Rich Asians,” how did you balance making sure you had a broad range of representation but also making sure that, at its core, the story was universal?
Adele Lim: Most people don’t approach work thinking, “I’m going to do a diverse project.” I think that you want to tell an authentic project, whatever it is. Even if it’s in a heightened, crazy, insane setting, it’s authentic to that crazy, insane setting. You want the roles you depict to be true to life when it does come to diversity and you don’t want implicit bias of the content creator to whitewash a project. It’s about building allies, not about scolding people and saying, “You’re not doing this.” Sometimes people are not aware, and I think we’re trying to increase that awareness and have people be more mindful about it.
THC: One thing that struck me about the film was the dialogue between the Asian-American experience and the Asian experience. I wanted to ask how you developed that dynamic and how your own experiences might’ve informed that.
AL: It was very interesting for me because I’ve been on both sides of the coin. I grew up in Malaysia, and I didn’t come here until I was 19. It was fascinating to me how a lot of Asian Americans who grew up here very much felt like the other, and [I] wanted to lean into that and see how that was different. It felt like a double whammy of growing up here and feeling like an other and also perceived as an other in what was supposedly your mother culture. That was an interesting thing to get into.
It came to a lot of interesting creative discussions when we wanted to figure out what the core conflict of the movie is, because there are movies like “The Big Sick” and other things where the disparity is more obvious, where you’re dating someone of a different culture of a different race. Here, he’s Chinese and she’s Chinese, so what’s the big issue? That’s an angle we wanted to explore with Eleanor: Her issue with Rachel wasn’t just being a stereotypical, evil-for-no-reason mother-in-law, but a fear that her family was going to break apart after everything she sacrificed to keep it together.
THC: You’ve discussed proving yourself by writing white stories in your own Hollywood career path. One thing I’ve seen to be a difficult issue to navigate is finding this balance: You don’t want to be pigeon-holed as an Asian-American writer who tells Asian-American stories, but also, if you’re not telling those stories, who is? Is there a balance to be found?
AL: I don’t think there’s a concrete way to break it down. When I was starting out, and things are a little bit different now, there were not a lot of other Asians that I could go to as a model I could emulate. It’s not about denying who you are, but you can see that there are projects out there getting picked up, which are getting funding, which are getting lauded, and if you’re just starting out, it was this feeling of, well, if I don’t do this, I’ll be perceived as a person who can only write about my culture.
To answer your question about how to balance the stories you want to tell, I don’t think there’s an easy answer to that. I feel like you do what authentically feels right to you, and sometimes you make decisions based on making sure you’re established enough in the industry. In my ideal world, we’re all writing for each other. My concern is that we’re not writing for each other. Because one culture is writing for themselves and the rest of us feel like we have to adhere to that, there’s this onus that I have to be the person writing specifically about my culture.
THC: I’ve heard backlash about the film saying that it celebrates Asian representation when it really more specifically channels an East Asian or an ethnically Chinese perspective. How do you grapple with the limitations of representation in any given story, especially in a space with relatively limited existing representation and so many expectations?
AL: Again, it’s your intent going into the project. There are not that many Asian Hollywood studio projects about Asians. Then the one project that is Asian suddenly has to take on the burden for all Asians. It has to take on criticism at a level that was often: Why are we only telling the story of rich Asians? Singapore is a small but very diverse country of Indians, Malays, and different kinds of Chinese, and why weren’t we telling that story?
Because that’s not the story we set out to tell. We set out to tell the story in Kevin Kwan’s book. It is not an after-school special where we’re like, this is the Asian project that will tell the story of all Asians and all economic classes and the struggles of all of us because A. it’s not possible, and B. approaching story that way is, I feel, approaching it from the wrong angle of approaching it with an agenda versus approaching it with the most compelling story you can possibly tell.
Ideally, within the small bubble of that family, we get to explore themes and issues that really resonate with other communities. The food scenes, which were very specific to my family and that culture, you find it resonates with the Latin American community, [and] the Persian American community. The more you can lean in an authentic and true way into that character and that character’s culture, hopefully there are universal truths about it that have a wider appeal.
THC: Moving forward, you’re currently working on a Disney project, but in general what are some stories you feel you’re personally hoping to see more of in Hollywood or stories you’d want to explore more?
AL: Everything! I want to see stories like, my grandmother was this amazing person who existed in a unique generation of having to bridge World War II… Men had those stories too, and it’s not just, “Oh, yay, women — let’s tell women’s stories.” The stories of women are amazing and rich and heartbreaking and rarely get told because you need that female writer or a male writer who is just uniquely empathetic and sympathetic to that. But, a lot of these women had to contend with families and children and the blood, guts, sweat, and tears of keeping children alive and keeping their families going, and a lot of them just dealt with it and soldiered on. A lot of them don’t even talk about it that much, and I want to make sure we get all those stories before it’s too late.

Ravyn Lenae put on an empowering performance that showcased her impeccable voice, incredibly high-reaching range, and delicate vibrato. Her red braids and sundress complemented the pink and red stage graphics,. Her body language channelled the same energy: peppy leg kicks, hair tosses, and swaying hips. She interspersed dialogue between all of her songs, once asking the audience to hold out their pinkies in the air and promise to move to the music and other times telling to raise their hands if they’ve ever fallen in love over the internet or been in a long-distance relationship. A personable, charismatic personality, she was conversational, and her message, for every woman and member of the audience to feel themselves, felt like a personal note to each individual. She shouted out black women and their edges before singing “The Night Song,” “black girl sauce” before singing “Spice,” and the duo who she says influenced her entire musical career, Outkast, before singing a cover of “Prototype.” Her songs ranged from heavy, upbeat rock to smooth, soft R&B. Backed by two guitarists and a drummer, her flawless voice gave the performance everything it needed.
SOB x RBE, a trap/hip-hop group comprised of four members, began their performance strongly. DJ Xslapz played recent and classic hits from Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” to Blueface’s “Thotiana” to Miley Cyrus’ “Party in the USA,” creating the mosh pit the three SOB x RBE rappers sustained when they mounted the stage. The DJ’s variations on the original songs were minor, only entertaining the crowd with occasional dialogue, which worked well with the hyped crowd. Much of the group’s music was tonally homogeneous, but it worked in the favor of the band. The crowd danced to the intense, beat-heavy music despite its lack of variation — their performance was predictable, but it was nonetheless a crowd-pleaser. They repeatedly paced the length of stage, singing into the microphone with one arm and gesturing ahead with the other to the pace of their rap. The background display had their SOB x RBE logo written inside continuously unfurling flames, and never changed from that. SOB x RBE put on a lively and smooth performance whose only flaw was that it could be more varied, and thereby more exciting and original.
Pop music artist MARINA, formerly known by the stage name Marina and the Diamonds, put on a mixed performance. She had an at-times cringeworthy stage presence, promoting her gig in September while she often paused to wait for audience members to cheer her on, telling one individual in the audience that she loved them too, and saying into her microphone to her background singers that she could not wait to drink cool champagne with them. It seemed performative and disingenuous, though not out of the ordinary relative to other artists. Her background singers were clad in pink while she wore a fitted bright green one-piece suit with a cape, keeping with her tradition of extravagant, unconventional costumes. Their choreography largely stayed the same throughout the show, with all of them swaying in place, raising their arms gracefully, and jutting out their hips in a simple routine. They occasionally descended the podium and contorted their bodies, and then would remount and return to the routine. They repeated variations of it so many times throughout the show that the dancing became distracting more than enhancive, including when they added silver pom-poms to the cheerleading-style choreography. Hits like “Primadonna” and Clean Bandit’s “Baby,” on which she is featured, were exciting to see performed live, but the highly edited, quickly changing nature imagery on the background display made little sense with her costume, dance, and overall stage. MARINA’s live singing itself was faultless and rich with personality, though much of her showmanship was either bizarre or underwhelming.
Joshua Karpeh, known to the music world as Cautious Clay, is new to the music scene. Karpeh got his start making beats and remixes on SoundCloud — including a remix of Billie Eilish’s “Ocean Eyes” before she made it big — before transitioning into making his own music. He first played in Boston at Great Scott in Allston a year ago, and that was only his third live performance. The Brooklyn-based multi-instrumentalist delivered a wide-ranging set spanning his three released EPs and some tantalizing unreleased material. At times, Karpeh relied on his voice alone, at others he played the saxophone and flute. He delivered his lyrics with a cool and calm cadence that created a chill atmosphere surrounding his stage. The front of the crowd, though, became fully immersed in the set, cheering loudly and dancing vigorously. Kareph seemed to feed off this energy, seemingly rewarding the audience with two unreleased tracks, including one co-written with John Mayer. He finished his set with “Cold War,” his most popular song that appeared in an episode of HBO’s “Insecure.” With lines like “‘Cause you only swipe right if you f**k for follows / Welcome to the days of the broke and shallow,” the song deals with modern romance and the superficiality that often comes with dating. Kareph ended the song with an extended saxophone solo before his band joined in for a triumphant display of instrumental talent. Fittingly, Kareph proclaims that “we’ll always be the one tough act to follow” in “Cold War,” which perfectly encapsulates his stellar performance.

Two months after the Astroworld – Wish You Were Here tour — during which he rode roller coaster and Ferris wheel sets on stage — the bar was high for Travis Scott, who was the final headliner at Boston Calling 2019. The creative genius behind one of last year’s most popular singles, “SICKO MODE,” as well as the critically acclaimed 2018 album “ASTROWORLD,” Scott is one of today’s largest cultural icons. He met these expectations at Boston Calling, where he executed an out-of-body, astronomical experience that transported the audience to new heights of light and sound.
Opening on a 1980s commercial for the Houston, Texas Six Flags amusement park, Scott’s act revolved around “ASTROWORLD.” He rapped “RIP SCREW,” “BUTTERFLY EFFECT,” and “STARGAZING,” alongside his features on Young Thug’s “The London” and SZA’s “Love Galore” and his 2014 single “Mamacita” and 2016 hit “Goosebumps.” While similar to the recorded versions of songs, they were higher energy, as Scott rapped with greater emphasis on certain lines.
On Scott’s set, the illusion of depth made it impossible to discern which objects were on the display and which were actual objects, from the gigantic teddy bear on the right side to a high-up hanging podium lit around the sides to resemble the top of a carousel, a reference to the second track on “ASTROWORLD,” “CAROUSEL.” The DJ towered above on an elevated surface with his mixer, while Scott appeared on the foreground of the stage wearing a tie-dye shirt that glowed under the blacklights. As the performance continued, parts of the seemingly 3D set, in part created by the displays, disappeared to allow for other backdrops, whether they were the Texan flag or state outline, graphics of the cosmos, or panoramic shots of the fanatic crowd as everyone raised their middle fingers shouting, “Fuck the club up!” along to “NO BYSTANDERS.” At one point graphic heads spun around on the 2D display, underneath the 3D carousel top whose lights made it seem like it was also spinning, and side displays outlined the silhouette of Scott and the lines of his tie-dye T-shirt in neon, on a black background, or lit up his figure as though he were made of sparks. The effects sometimes changed as rapidly as the beat, combined with upward bursts of flame and smoke and flashing colored spotlights that blared out over the audience, pumping adrenaline into the air. It was all on-brand for Scott, who was featured on Forgotten’s “Strobe Lights.”
Scott’s concert saliently exemplified when the audience contributes significantly to the holistic experience — engagement was widespread, and Travis Scott knew how to ask for it, whether commanding his fans to get low, turn their phone flashlights on, or raise both arms. The crowd followed along more than any other of the weekend. Without Scott, the crowd sang the introductory verse of “CAN’T SAY.”
It was Scott’s expertise, nonetheless, that kept the energy at the brink of explosion. Early on, he said he would “keep this motherfucker open until 4 a.m.” which was met by a roar of applause (even though he ended several minutes early.) He strategically calculated transitions, subtly hinting at what the next song would be to build tension. He complained that people need to pick up their cell phones before “Pick Up the Phone,” and asked who was the “highest in the room” before his last track, an unreleased song that features the lyric. He removed his shirt in time for “Antidote,” and the lyric “open up that window.” Scott appeared small before the monolithic carousels behind him, accentuating the grandiosity of the world within the stage, standing in a wide stance as he spit verses on stage and hanging podium alike. During one of the show’s best transitions, Scott appeared magically on the lower tier of the hanging podium and noted that there was only one more mode that he and the already-riled audience could possibly reach. The blaring that opens “SICKO MODE” caused frenzy.
A cohesive style — a thunderous, dungeon-slamming sound at the end of each song, piercing hawk screeches, the whirlwind amusement park iconography, and the flair of his music itself — grounded the many transitions throughout Scott’s performance. Scott did not simply put on a show — in a heady hour and a half, he transported the audience into a world of his creation.

At the Grammy Awards this year, the up and coming Texas-bred singer Kacey Musgraves shocked many by taking home not just all of the night’s major country awards, but the coveted “Album of the Year” award for her most recent album “Golden Hour.” The first country artist to win both album of the year and country music album of the year since Taylor Swift nine years ago, Musgraves beat out nominees with greater name recognition — Drake, Cardi B, Janelle Monaé, and Post Malone, to name a few.
At this year’s Governors Ball music festival, many came to her Saturday set to see what all the buzz was about. Stretched out in front of the stage, despite the above average collection of bedazzled cowgirl hats, it was hardly a “country” crowd. It was Musgraves’ job, then, to win us over.
She started off not with a bang but a “Slow Burn,” a fitting name for the opener on “Golden Hour.” “Born in a hurry, always late, haven’t been early since ‘88,’” she crooned, the twang of her guitar floating beneath sweet and sincere self-deprecation. Her lyrics are witty and easy to remember, and some in the audience managed to sing back every line. Pointedly simple, the stripped-back number excited fans, even if it didn’t exactly fill the space.
After an understated opener, things started to ramp up to another song off “Golden Hour.” “Baby I ain’t Wonder Woman,” she repeated through the chorus, as audience members smiled and nodded along. After the first two songs, she paused to introduce herself and give a few instructions to the audience. “Give your neighbor a high five — now put two middle fingers in the air. Good, we’re ready!” she said with a side-eyed smile.
Kaleidoscopic flowers and insects cycled across the screen behind her as she launched into “Butterflies,” her biggest hit. “Golden Hour” is full of the triumphant simplicity of happiness, the little joys of a love that’s really working. “Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down…” she sings, smiling, “you give me butterflies.”
Her second biggest hit is “Rainbow,” which she pulled out right before closing with the spunky “High Horse.” “Rainbow” is a very Kacey song — as she put it, it's dedicated “to [the LGBT] community, but also to anyone who has any kind of a weight on their shoulders,” epitomizing the double-edged sword that is her attempt to be a “rebel” but also appeal to everybody. “There’s always been a rainbow hanging over your head” seems the chorus of a born crowd-pleaser, not someone breaking the mold. It has little fresh or specific to say about life in general or the queer experience, instead opting for rain metaphors about cloudy skies and keeping your “head above water.” But even the simplicity of the “it gets better” anthem is a bold step forward for country music. In fact, it and previous songs like Kacey’s early hit “Follow Your Arrow” were banned from many radio stations simply for their acceptance of the LGBT community. It’s a testament to her character that this made Kacey even more bold in singing about her beliefs, rather than prompting her to cave for air time. Perhaps, the simple warmth she exudes is meaningful in its own way, albeit absent of specificity. As the breathy closer “it’ll all be alright” washed over the crowd, it was hard not to believe her — and maybe that simplicity is part of her magic.
She’s got a type of positivity that’s decidedly honest, not feeling the need to paint over every bad thing in order to recognize the good in the world. “Love is this little tiny thing that’s gonna find it’s way up through the cracks in the sidewalks,” she said as she introduced “Love is a Wild Thing.” Perhaps she’ll be the Taylor Swift who stays put, content in the warmth of the crowd and the sunlight of her imperfect Texas town — not desperate to keep evolving.
At a certain point, the way we evaluate music is inevitably arbitrary. Is “Golden Hour” the best album in the world? Probably not. Her songs sound like a sunny summary of the human experience, rather than the distillation of something fresh and personal. She enjoys being simple and classic, tying her act together in the ruby on her poppy-patterned pants, red nails, red lips, and red solo cups.
At the end of the day, Kacey Musgraves is just a girl with a guitar — but she sure will leave you with a smile on your face.

There’s a singular kind of self-aware charm that surrounds the 5-man indie rock group Hippo Campus. Hailing from St. Paul, Minn., the band didn’t take long to win over the audience at their Friday afternoon set at the Governors Ball music festival. They led with a song with less name recognition than hits like “Buttercup” or “Way it Goes” — “Doubt,” a standout from their newest album “Bambi.” The song was written by lead singer Jake Luppen, whose vocals sounded even more vibrant and meticulous in person. He grabbed the mic and weaved his way around the choppy satire of its opening lines: “Good guy, it’s a toss-up / so sweet, but she’s a little fucked up.” As Luppen launched into the back-and-forth self-deprecation of “Doubt,” he flashed his signature goofy grin. Even on the more earnest choruses, he couldn’t quite wipe the smile off his face.
Hippo Campus wasn’t afraid to show off how much fun they had on stage. They transitioned into “Bambi,” the lead single off their newest album, with was met with screams of recognition and the bathing of the stage in on-brand pink lights. The lyrics seemed to fit Luppen perfectly — self-aware and precise, he leaned in and out of the push-pull notes on the chorus. Eyes trained on the crowd, he danced around the stage as though there was nothing else he would rather be doing.
Closing out “Bambi,” Luppen took his sunglasses off for the first time during the set and warmed up the crowd with a cheerful “Thanks so much for coming!” He seemed entirely comfortable. The band moved through their discography with similar energy, alternating almost evenly between songs off “Bambi” and their older album and EPs. They seemed to enjoy showing one another off, smiling affectionately as they shared the spotlight.
Known for performing instrumental sections in the middle of songs and taking their time, they integrated guitar solos and trumpet riffs into sprawling numbers without losing too much steam. Drummer Whistler Allen was integral to sustaining the crowd’s energy, as was the evident passion each performer doled out evenly to both vocal and instrumental sections.
After warming up the crowd with some of the sugary, warm-tinted indie pop that had first made them famous, the band turned to their more introspective discography. On the aptly-titled “Bubbles,” Luppen flooded the audience with gurgling sound and sang the syncopated hook: “You could call me irregular / I'm a basic fix for a better man / Seasons change I'm a maniac / For a better known with a bitter end.”
Beneath the sunny hooks on many of their songs, a note of profound honesty in the lyrics drove the second half of the set. The band has described their newest album as a conscious move toward greater vulnerability, and said that a shift in their songwriting process was essential to this new direction. Instead of cooking up choruses as a purely collaborative effort, on “Bambi” they decided to write self-contained songs on their own, and then present those songs to the group to allow each song to have a specific voice. That individuality elevated their songwriting in a lot of ways, and somewhat unintentionally also positioned them as an interesting voice in the conversation on male mental health.
“In the past we might have been apprehensive about being super-vulnerable, but now we’re more aware of how important it is to come forward about dealing with depression or anxiety,” Lupen said in an interview with Billboard. “Because if more men are able to do that, they might be less likely to express those feelings as anger or violence.”
Turning a corner, Hippo Campus gave the eager audience a surprise — a performance of an unreleased, currently untitled song supposedly “coming out soon.” Something of a departure from their more signature mellow-electronic sound, it featured a louder, more heavy-hitting bass guitar that was complemented by the stage’s flashing strobe lights. Perhaps this leaning on Hippo Campus’s more rock-heavy influences signals a shift for the band; however, it’s not without their signature, open-book songwriting.
As they neared the end of the set, it was difficult not to feel that there was something genuinely fresh about their shiny, self-aware brand of indie rock. They integrated their experimental instrumentals surprisingly well into the live show and blended an easy charisma with insightful, self-deprecating lyrics. All in all, Hippo Campus’s live show was a delightful take on fun, traditional indie rock ballads — with impressive sonic creativity and lyrical insight.

There are certain emotions that can only really be expressed in a Florence + The Machine song. At the end of the night on Saturday, pressed up against the metal barrier at the very front of the crowd, I experienced a new one.
A streaming silhouette of red-orange, Florence Welch ascended to her headlining set at Governors Ball toward a thin pinprick of light. She started off with the quiet of “June,” the first song off her latest album. “Hunger” was next, its breathy intro summoning a kind of morbid energy. The song is something of a risk for the pop star: Its razor-edged specificity is a stark change from the radio favorites that helped make her famous.
The first vocals mimicked her breath, each ascending note more labored than the last. “At seventeen, I started to starve myself,” she whispered out. “I thought that love was a kind of emptiness / And at least I understood then the hunger I felt / and I didn’t have to call it loneliness.”
I had already become numbingly familiar with “Hunger”’s autobiography, the indistinct outline of some unspoken fear so out of sync with the freedom of her performances. But nothing had prepared me for the spectacle of it, the way it would feel to see our shared shame paraded about in front of a thousand people, euphorically released and subdued at the same time. It was an almost ludicrous confession emanating from this wild, towering woman. How could she possibly believe her excess was anything other than mesmerizing?
When it comes to gender, eating disorders don’t discriminate. But there is something particular about the way they intersect with social prescriptions of femininity, feeding off the expectation that women shrink and limit and fence themselves in. Speaking for so many, Florence unleashed the disease of insufficiency that had wormed its way into the laugh lines of my best friend, hid beneath my little sister’s baggy sweatshirts, and the guilt in my mother’s eyes. Pulling back from the distance of spectacle and performance, she showed us Florence Welch, the woman behind the show.
In the intimacy of her performance, she captured the particular desperation that ensuing emptiness leaves us with. It drove her gigantic leaps, her soaring vocals, her random, fiery sprints across the stage. It fueled the set’s compounding sonic ambition, the cinematic drama of abrupt blackouts and grand thundering intros.
She summoned the enemies of collective womanhood out into the light, the demons that tortured a starving 17 year old elevated to towering urgency. “We all have a hunger!” She chanted above the crowd of kindred spirits. Thankfully, that was far from the end.
The song began to swell and cameramen weaved their way underneath her. Florence raised her arms, only smoke and darkness behind her. A stream-of-thought transition carried her to something impersonal: “Oh and you in all your vibrant youth…” she sang to the crowd. “You make a fool of death with your beauty, and for a moment,” she paused. “I forget to worry.”
Reinvigorated, Florence moved through the revelatory openers on each of her two older albums, “Ship To Wreck” and “Only If For A Night.” Anthemic drumbeats riled the crowd as she whirled across the stage, newly lighter, her long billowy sleeves straining to keep up.
Afterward, she paused to introduce herself to the crowd. Her speaking voice was uniquely enchanting, enhanced by the mystical harp notes that played behind it and the twirling of her restless wrists. “It’s weird that I’m shy isn’t it?” she said, lilting and coy. “You wouldn’t think I would be shy.” With a wink, she launched into a description of her tribute to punk rock legend Patti Smith, “Patricia.” “This one’s kind of about toxic masculinity,” she said with a sly smile.
Her lyrics have a knife-like precision: “Well, you're a 'real man', and you do what you can,” she taunted the audience, “you only take as much as you can grab with two hands.” She paced across the stage as though delivering her anger, not just to a female throng, but some of the very people that inspired it. On its ringing chorus of “I believe her, I believe her, I believe her,” her operatic riff on the last note sent the words up to the sky like an offering.
She moved on then to her older hits, situating the number one “Dog Days are Over” at a well-chosen emotional high point. To follow, “100 Years” reached a fever pitch, one second pure soprano, the next a triumphant belt in her highest range. “What Kind of Man” seemed an unlikely closer, but was quickly followed by an encore of “No Choir” and “Big God.”
Finally, she told the audience: “We’ve got one more song for you tonight. Will you be our choir for this evening?” To shouts of affirmation, she closed out with the familiar, ringing optimism of “Shake It Out.” “And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back / so shake him off!” she yelled over the auditorium. And one last time, the audience obeyed, rippling with energy, hands outstretched as they laughed, leaned on one another, and lost themselves in a lingering release.
The song worked as a collective exorcism: She summoned out our smothered fears one last time and banished them to the fire. These demons may not be gone forever, but I can promise, for the rest of the night, they wouldn’t have dared go near followers of the flaming woman in her cream lace nightie.

Armin Afsahi will serve as new associate vice president and dean of development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University announced in a press release Tuesday.
In his new role, Afsahi will lead efforts to outline and execute a fundraising plan for FAS.
Afsahi called his appointment a “career-defining moment” for him in a press release and said he is “excited” to work at the University.
“I consider it an honor and privilege to support the research and scholarship, and the teaching and learning that enables the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to have such an impact on Harvard and in the world, fostering progress and leading change,” Afsahi said.
Afsahi has previously served as the vice chancellor for advancement at the University of Denver — a parallel role to the one he will assume at Harvard. He has also held senior roles in this field at Georgetown University and the University of California, San Diego.
Over the course of his career, Afsahi has overseen several capital campaigns, according to the press release. At the University of Denver, Afashi substantially increased giving each year under his tenure — which began in 2015 – and launched the school’s first $1 billion capital campaign. He also led $2 billion campaigns at UC San Diego and Georgetown.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in a press release that she is “eager” to work with Afashi when he begins his role on August 1.
“From my first encounters with Armin, I was impressed by his belief in the power of discovery and innovation to effect positive change, his desire to work closely with faculty to advance an institution, and his ability to inspire and be inspired by an intellectual community,” Gay said.
Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee said in a press release Afsahi is “ideally suited” for his new job at Harvard.
“I look forward to working with him as he develops strong relationships with Harvard’s dedicated alumni volunteers, deepening and expanding that engagement through his own creative vision,” Lee said.
Afsahi’s appointment comes a year after Harvard’s record-breaking $9.6 billion capital campaign, which ended in June 2018. The campaign, which was launched in 2013, surpassed its original goal by more than $3 billion.
In that campaign, FAS — which houses the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences — raised $3.2 billion of the total sum, far surpassing its own $2.5 billion goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard track coach Walter W. Johnson ’71 pled guilty Monday to possession of child pornography, the United States Attorney’s office announced Tuesday.
Johnson served as a track and field coach for Harvard’s men’s and women’s teams from 1982 to 2006. During his time as an undergraduate at Harvard, he played on the football team his junior and senior years and captained the men’s track team.
After more than 20 years at Harvard, Johnson departed his coaching position to take up roles as an assistant track coach and a special education teaching assistant at Wellesley High School and Wellesley Middle School.
Johnson was arrested and charged with possession and distribution of child pornography in April 2017. Federal agents began investigating Johnson in January of that year based on allegations that Johnson was trading child pornography on Craigslist. Over the course of their search, federal agents traced explicit Craiglist messages back to email accounts belonging to Johnson.
The investigation culminated in an April 2017 search of his Framingham, Mass. home, where federal agents found sexually explicit images and videos on Johnson’s electronic devices. During the search of this home, Johnson confirmed he was the user of the email accounts and that he had used Craigslist advertisements to exchange explicit messages with other individuals, primarily men. Johnson was arrested on scene and then indicted by a federal grand jury, according to the press release.
The charge of possession of child pornography carries a minimum five year sentence that can extend up to 20 years and up to a lifetime of supervised release. The charge could also yield Johnson an additional fine of up to $250,000.
Johnson’s guilty plea was announced Tuesday by U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Peter C. Fitzhugh. The Internet Crimes Against Children task forces from Massachusetts and Rhode Island and the Framingham Police Department provided assistance in investigating Johnson’s case, according to the press release.
Johnson’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 10.
Johnson’s lawyer Syrie D. Fried declined to comment for this story.

Boston’s annual Dragon Boat Festival took over the Charles River Sunday for its 40th anniversary, drawing over 30,000 people to Cambridge for a day filled with food, festivities, and fun.
Founded in 1979, the celebration is the first and oldest such festival in North America. It was originally conceived as a small neighborhood event — the brainchild of Boston Children’s Museum staff members Marcia Iwasaki, Nancy Sato, and Leslie Swartz who were all present at Sunday's events. Today, the festival is the largest Asian American cultural event in New England, according to current Boston Dragon Boat Festival President Gail Wang.
“Our aim is to connect Asian communities, to celebrate Asian culture in the Greater Boston area through food, performances, arts and crafts, and, of course, to promote dragon boat racing,” Wang said in an interview Tuesday.
Beginning at 8 a.m., hundreds crowded the John W. Weeks Footbridge to spectate lively dragon boat races. A record 76 teams of over 1500 paddlers from across the country, representing schools, museums, banks, and cancer survivors, paddled along the Charles River in colorful 39-foot-Hong Kong-style dragon boats (above). The Boston Dragon Boat Festival has grown significantly since its 1979 inaugural races when its first-ever long boats were borrowed from Boston public schools and decorated by local schools and artists, Wang said.
Spectators along the Charles River ate zongzi — traditional Chinese rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves — in between races (above). The food holds significance in the over 2000-year-long tradition of the ancient Chinese festival, as both the dish and festival memorialize Chinese poet and political leader Qu Yuan who lived from 340 to 278 B.C, according to the event's website.
The Cambridge event also showcased a variety of cultural performances from several Boston-area Asian organizations, including a traditional Chinese dance by the Needham-based Artisan Dance Academy.
Wah Lum Kung Fu and Tai Chi Academy students traveled to Cambridge from Malden, Mass. to perform a dragon dance and demonstrate martial arts (above). The group comprised students of all ages from preschool to high school.
As the festival’s frenzy continued throughout the almost 80-degree day, vendors at stands and in food trucks lined up along Memorial Drive to sell Asian snacks and drinks to hungry and parched festival attendees. Offerings included Satay chicken skewers and lo mein from Royal East Restaurant as well as boba milk tea from the Tea Station food truck (above).
For decades, the festival has attracted a diverse audience across all ages — from Harvard students to Tsinghua University Alumni dragon boat racers — for a weekend of cultural celebration and spirited competition, Wang said.
“Our event has always had a focus on family,” Wang said. “I think it’s really amazing this ancient Chinese tradition has so much life today and can motivate and encourage people of all different walks of life.”
