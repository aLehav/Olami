After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard affiliates gathered on the steps of Memorial Church Sunday evening for a candlelit vigil honoring the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Ankara, Turkey.
The two explosions, which occurred Oct. 10, constitute the biggest terrorist attack in modern Turkey’s history, killing more than 100 people. The attack occurred in Ankara’s Central railway station as hundreds of people gathered for a peace rally organized by leftist and Kurdish activists. Sunday night’s vigil was organized by the Harvard College Turkish Student Association.
“The ideal takeaway is that as citizens of Turkey here at Harvard, we are able to come together and stand against such an act of terrorism,” President of HCTSA Goksenin Akdeniz ’18 said.
The vigil began with a speech written by Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Cemal Kafadar, advisor of HCTSA, who was unable to attend the event.
Those “souls who came to Ankara from all corners of Turkey to take part in a peaceful public demonstration are now dead,” said Cansu Colakoglu ’16, a former president of HCTSA, reading Kafadar’s speech in his absence. “We should do our best to not reduce them to dehumanizing abstractions of numbers or political strategies, but to remember them as neighbors, as teachers, as students, as construction workers, as physicians, as railroad workers and engineers.”
In addition to memorializing the victims of the attack, Kafadar’s speech called upon the Turkish government to find and identify the perpetrators.
“We have had enough crimes and acts of terror classified as ‘perpetrator unknown.’ We need to know. Every day that this goal remains unaccomplished is one more day for the worst suspicions to linger, for rumors to spread, for the polarization to deepen. Let us be vigilant of our right to be informed,” read Colakoglu.
The event ended with a speech by Can Soylu ’14, a recent graduate and former president of HCTSA, speaking on behalf of the organization. Soylu said he sought to “make sense of what [this attack] should mean” in his address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 17, 2015, at 8:30 p.m.
EASTON, Penn.—On Saturday afternoon, the Lafayette football team (1-6, 0-2 Patriot) emerged dramatically, racing through an inflatable leopard’s head and sprinting down a sideline packed with homecoming fans.
A few minutes later, when play actually began, the great feline blow-up had deflated to a trembling sheet, forcing groundskeepers to drag the plastic off the field.
It may not have been a metaphor, but the fate of the inflatable set the tone on an afternoon when the visiting Crimson (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) took the air out of the Leopards’ offense. Harvard held Lafayette to negative 18 rushing yards, and for the first time since 1930, the Crimson conceded less than three points for the third straight week, smothering the Leopards, 42-0.
“We’re a good football team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We do the things good football teams do. Specifically, we played great defense.”
The closest Lafayette came to scoring on the Crimson’s first-team defense came on the host’s first possession of the third quarter, when quarterback Drew Reed moved his team into the red zone after three straight completions to top receiver Matt Mrazek.
A few plays later, Mrazek appeared to score when he wrested a 50-50 ball away from senior defensive back Jordan Becerra. But a holding call negated the play, and Lafayette turned the ball over on downs to preserve the blank sheet.
Meanwhile, Harvard exerted total control from the start en route to its 19th consecutive win. Senior quarterback Scott Hosch led two early touchdown drives, senior running back Paul Stanton eclipsed 100 rushing yards on his second carry of the third quarter, and for the fifth week in a row, second-stringers saw significant playing time.
One starter who made major contributions after halftime was senior tight end Ben Braunecker, who totaled 123 yards on six catches, all in the second half. Late in the third quarter, he was the focal point of the Crimson’s longest drive of the day, a 90-yard march that ended with a scoring run by senior wide receiver Seitu Smith.
However, the standout performance of the day came from a defensive unit that opened the game with a trio of three-and-outs. Throughout the contest, Harvard brought pressure in creative ways, ending with four sacks. Tight coverage in the secondary limited Reed to just over five yards per attempt.
“Football is a lot about momentum,” senior linebacker Eric Medes said. “The fact that we could shut them down right away and sort of demoralize them…that really helps with the tone of the game.”
The same could not be said for the Lafayette defense, which allowed car-sized holes throughout the game. On the Crimson’s first touchdown drive, it was Stanton who capitalized, tallying 44 yards on three carries and a 16-yard score.
Stanton added another touchdown—a one-yard churn—in the final minute of the first half. On that possession, Harvard received the ball on its own 44 after a deflected punt by senior defensive back Sean Ahern, the fourth such play this season.
However, the Crimson special teams showed some cracks over the afternoon. In the first quarter, sophomore punter Zach Schmid shanked two separate punts, one of which landed in the stands.
That wayward kick ended Harvard’s first possession, which showed more signs of sloppiness than success. On consecutive plays, the Leopards’ defensive line broke through to force a holding call, a batted pass, and a hurried throwaway.
Still, the Crimson defense matched its counterpart tackle-for-tackle—and then some. Lafayette didn’t record a first down until 3:25 remained in the first quarter. On that drive, the Leopards moved the chains two more times, but the attack stalled after a 10-yard sack by junior defensive tackle Miles McCollum.
“They’re a really banged up team,” Murphy said. “They’ve had as many injuries as any Division I team I’ve seen in a long time…. That certainly was a critical factor in the game.”
On an afternoon when youth and depth were on display, two freshmen propelled the Crimson’s second scoring march. Wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley advanced Harvard into enemy territory with a 40-yard run-and-catch, and running back Noah Reimers pushed the attack to the one-yard line.
In this case, Hosch won the box score glory, diving in for the touchdown. But Reimers would get his own score with 12:46 left—a four-yard rush that pushed the margin to 42.
The only non-rushing score of the game came in the third quarter, when Braunecker benefited from blown coverage on a 32-yard post route.
“Scotty’s my boy,” Braunecker said. “We’ve been doing this even on the scout team freshman year all the way up until now, so this is just sort of the tip of the iceberg that’s coming into the spotlight right now.”
Saturday’s prolific offensive performance capped a historic five-game start to the season in which Harvard has averaged 44 points per game; no Crimson team has matched this feat since 1892. Moreover, Harvard did not commit a turnover for the fourth straight game. The team ranks first in the FCS with only one giveaway all season.
Yet the most important zero at the end of the game was the one next to the Leopards’ name on the scoreboard. When, with three minutes left, the Crimson defense stopped Lafayette on its final possession, part of the Harvard bench spilled onto the field—starters and second-stringers celebrating as the shutout drew to a close.
“Getting a shutout might be one of the hardest things to do in football,” Medes said. “Just being able to pride ourselves on that and have two of them so far this season, it’s pretty great.”

For those worrying that Canadian Thanksgiving had finally meant doom for Harvard’s most beloved celebrity, you can breathe a sigh of relief. The turkey is still waddling around Cambridge with the same self-absorbed independence that has made students fall in love. But now its infamy has spread from the exclusive email lists of Dunster House to Facebook.
The page is christened, simply, “The Harvard Turkey.” Frankly, it’s surprising that some witty Harvard student hasn’t given it a more pretentious name yet. Or that it hasn’t been made as the new mascot of Harvard’s sports teams instead of that weird pilgrim guy.
Users have posted updates about the Turkey’s whereabouts. One student caught the turkey embroiled in an epic standoff with an incensed Cambridge driver this past week on Mass Ave. And when it’s not stopping drivers, the turkey is trying to break into the cars lining Harvard Street, according to another. Indeed, this turkey seems to have a penchant for crime.
With such an interest in automobiles, one has to wonder how long #turkeywatch will continue? It’s only a matter of time before the turkey messes with the wrong Bostonian driver, or even worse, has a “transformative experience” with Dean Khurana’s new Vespa. Thanksgiving might come early again in the dining halls with roasted turkey breast with unusual tire marks.
For those who were wondering which gender pronoun to identify the turkey with, you’ll be interested to find out that we have it on good, Facebook-proven authority that the turkey is a female. Max Schaffer ‘17, long-time admirer of the turkey, set the record straight this Friday evening. “But also its a female turkey just so ya kno,” he posted on the Facebook page’s wall.

All Harvard students need a TV show or two to binge watch. Remember– it is sometimes important to avoid responsibilities and take a mental vacation. Here are 6 shows you should be watching:
Arrow and The Flash
If you’re into superheroes, particularly of the DC variety, or you’re just excited about attractive people wearing attractive costumes, these are the shows for you. They’re linked together, and have crossover episodes once or twice a season. This is the best two-for-one deal you’ll see all fall. These shows involve a lot of action scenes but also heartfelt connections between various characters. Plus, if you’re familiar with the comic books, it’s always fun to see characters that are new to the shows connect back to the original stories. Arrow Season 4 and The Flash Season 2 are currently airing. #NetflixAndChill with the previous seasons.
Sherlock
Looking for a bit of English culture in your life? You should check out Sherlock! This BBC show only has 3 episodes per season, and while learning that it won’t be coming back for a year after you thought it would is almost as bad as remembering you live in the Quad, the wait is worth it every time. This show challenges your mind, and we all know that Harvard kids love to be thinking even in their so-called ‘break time.’ It is interesting to try and figure out the mystery as it unfolds before you, and you’ll find that every detail is essential to understanding the solution to the mystery. This show balances the perfect amount of sarcastic humor and touching moments. As of now, there are 3 seasons of Sherlock, all of which are available on Netflix. While we will have to wait an eternity for season 4, there is a Christmas Special episode this December.
Scandal
If you ever feel like there’s not enough suspense in your life between wondering how you’re supposed to get that English paper done in 45 minutes and thinking about whether you’re going to develop health problems because of the alarming number of cookies you eat at Brain Break, you should watch Scandal. The action never stops in this show, and just when you think you know where it’s headed, you encounter another plot twist. If you’re a fan of strong female leads, Kerry Washington will fill the hole in your soul that you didn’t know was there. Scandal is on its 5th season– catch up with all four previous seasons on Netflix.
Grey’s Anatomy
Grey’s is perfect for you if you want to fool yourself into thinking you’re learning science while shamelessly enjoying what is essentially a soap opera. Although you do pick up certain medical terms along the way, this show is for those of you who love hot romance, conflict, and drama. Be prepared to get emotionally attached to the characters’ lives in a way you never expected was possible before. There are a whopping 11 seasons of Grey’s Anatomy, with 12 airing right now! So the average Harvard student could procrastinate on at least 10 major assignments with this show. Oh, and all 11 seasons are on Netflix so you don’t have to expend the effort of clicking the next episode.
Friends
This is hands down the best show to binge-watch. With only ½-hour episodes, you can convince yourself that watching 6 in a row is acceptable even though that adds up to three 3-hour episodes which is definitely questionable. This show never fails to be funny. Between Ross’s nerdy humor, Joey’s sexual innuendos, Chandler’s sarcastic banter, Phoebe’s dazed confusion, Rachel’s general naivety, and Monica’s obsessive personality, you couldn’t find a funnier or more dysfunctional group of 6 people. Oh wait, we’re at Harvard. That changes things. In all seriousness, if you haven’t watched this show, you should definitely check it out. The show actually deals with a lot of day-to-day issues many of us deal with, but by putting into a humorous light, it makes us realize it’s not so bad. All 10 episodes are on...you got it. Netflix. And the best part? When someone asks you what you’re doing this weekend, you can truthfully reply that you have plans with friends.
