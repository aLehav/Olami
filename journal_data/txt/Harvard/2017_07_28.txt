After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week’s premiere of “Game of Thrones” set the show off to a slowly rolling start, and I’m not quite sure if the second episode, “Stormborn,” picks up the pace. We’re at that point in the series where all of the titular characters are meeting: Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) is heading home; Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is about to meet Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke); Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) and Olenna Tyrell (Diana Rigg) are forging the same alliance with Daenerys. And they’re all against Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), who presumably will meet the aforementioned Mother of Dragons.
And yet, even though multiple plot points have been set in place with these meetings, the series still feels like it’s struggling to find its speed. This may be because fans of the show have already been keeping up-to-date with each individual’s history. We’ve followed Jon Snow’s trek past the Wall, and we’ve seen Daenerys accomplish the impossible across the Narrow Sea.
So while these characters are still trying to understand each other, we already do, which makes the wait even more agonizing. For fans, there is no mystery as to who Jon Snow is, even though Daenerys is skeptical about her nephew (and they don’t even know they’re related). There are about a million questions that need answers, like: Is Daenerys going to trust Jon? What will Jon’s reaction be if the Red Woman sticks around? And how will Sansa (Sophie Turner) react to Arya’s return and new persona? The faster these characters meet and the faster they answer these questions, the faster the ever-looming threats of Cersei and the White Walkers will push the series’ to its natural, chaotically-built pace.
When the characters do meet, it’s not always successful. One of the more anticipated reunions of this episode was the one between Arya and her old direwolf, Nymeria. When Nymeria approaches Arya’s campfire in the woods, Arya hopefully asks her to be her companion to Winterfell. Nymeria leaves, and Arya is heartbroken but understanding. She says “That’s not you.” Were this a foreshadowing to Arya’s potential disappointment in Winterfell’s transformation from her childhood home to a place of scarred torment and worry, this scene would make more sense. A symbol of more peaceful times, Nymeria leaving could have been the perfect representation of this natural reaction (if it were to happen).
But because of those three words—"That’s not you"—I’m confused about what character arc the writers are trying to develop in Arya. “That’s not you” is an allusion to season one, when Ned Stark explained to Arya what her role as a lady would be like: marriage and childbearing. “That’s not me,” Arya said. Back at time when we were unsure of who Arya was, this was fitting. Fast forward six seasons, and we know that Arya is not a lord-marrying, childbearing lady. She’s Arya Stark of Winterfell, who cuts up murderers into pies and poisons a whole room of them, sparing the innocent.
And Arya knows who she is too. So for her to say “That’s not you” to Nymeria at the beginning of the seventh season raises a character arc that was already settled, and complicates the ongoing one. Yes, Nymeria is a wild creature who won’t like the confines of a castle. So is Arya. But she’s not going there to be confined—she’s going there to see her family, which Nymeria has in her pack as well. So what does “That’s not you” mean in this new context? It’s unclear, but the answer will hopefully come to light in later episodes.
Farther north, more trouble is brewing in Winterfell. Jon hands off the power to Sansa as he rides to Dragonstone to meet Daenerys. Sansa is smart, but all the while, Littlefinger lurks closeby.
Will there be a power struggle between Sansa, Jon, and Daenerys in future episodes? Perhaps, but right now the Khaleesi has other problems on her hands. Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbæk) foils her clever strategy of laying siege to King’s Landing by ambushing Ellaria and Yara Greyjoy’s (Gemma Whelan) ship. In this scene, both Alfie Allen (who plays Theon Greyjoy) and Whelan excel. When Euron has Yara, he gives Theon a chance to save her. But Theon decides to jump ship, abandoning his sister. Allen’s eyes are wide with fear and shame, while Whelan’s face twists in disappointment.
Another notable performance comes from Jacob Anderson (who plays Grey Worm, a castrated soldier). Grey Worm professes his love to Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel), and save for a few uncomfortably cheesy lines, the scene is tender and heartwarming. All of the Unsullied are eunuchs, which Missandei knows as she moves to take off his clothes. It’s here when Grey Worm tries to stop her, and that’s when Anderson’s brilliant acting comes through. Grey Worm looks like he’s on the brink of crying, which is entirely suitable for his character in this scene. Anderson’s performance helps save the poor dialogue, making his love and embarrassment feel more real than lines like “You are my weakness” ever will.
“Game of Thrones” has talented actors, but some lines of this particular episode made it difficult, even for them. Some examples: “You’re a dragon. So be a dragon,” “I choose you,” “If you ever betray me, I’ll burn you alive,” “I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.” Cue smirk. The dialogue is delivered uncomfortably because they feel tacky and unfitting—like the writers know that these will be quoted in gifs and beyond on the Internet. This approach never makes for good writing.
Regardless, “Game of Thrones” has always performed best later in its seasons, when all the pieces are put into place and gears are in motion. The next episode’s synopsis seems promising: “Daenerys holds court; Cersei returns a gift; Jaime learns from his mistakes.” Is the gift return Ellaria’s dead body? What mistakes are they referring to? We’ll only know when “The Queen's Justice” premieres next Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backpack still bouncing from my scale up the rock, I lifted my head to squint at the setting sun. Nine weeks out in the bay and Land’s End remained on my list of touristy places that I had yet to hit. A quick scroll on Google Images confirmed what I had heard about the beauty of the place and brought me to Mile Rock Beach this particular Saturday evening.
I swung my legs over the ledge and felt my way into a comfortable position against the stone skeleton. A perfect panorama sprawled before me, a rocky shoreline on the left fading into the sky and falling sun, a faded Golden Gate Bridge towards the right, cut off by the dark outline of a cliff. Though a spectacular scene, I had yet to decide whether it was worth it.
Worth what? Not the climb up the rock. No, that was fine. The question was how I would get down. I watched others slide, scurry, and run down the uneven surface that I had just climbed atop. Some were even in flip-flops. I have always been scared of going downhill. Going uphill was physically strenuous, but it also felt safer. Sure, I needed to push myself, but the activity was almost mindless. There was always some peak, some goal, which I was aiming for.
Only much later, after the sun had already dipped halfway down the horizon, did I realize my novice mistake of ignoring the tide. Looking down from my perch at the dark water obscuring the bottom, my gut dropped as the way down became even more daunting. I pulled my shoes off and slowly stuffed my socks in them. Splashing as I stepped down, white foam swirled around my thighs. The cold sent a shock through me, but the feeling was not unpleasant. I laughed.
As nice as the rock had been for the sunset, I needed to get down. A cold breeze was already steadily blowing by, and darkness was settling in. The world was moving forward and I could not stay there. This summer has been challenging, exhilarating, and a break from the routine of schoolwork. With a little more than a month left, I know that I cannot stay with these sunsets and clouds forever. I will soon be ready to come down, to find a new rock to climb.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I support political correctness—not because I come from a marginalized background, but because I am a human being. As a human being I understand the value of political correctness because I am aware of the harm that words can have on a person. I have learned the weight that words can carry.
The annual Leadership Conference for Best Buddies—a charity supporting individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities—was this past weekend, and I reflected on my own time there two years ago. I reveled in the amount of strength and talent that could be found in people with disabilities when given the right spaces to showcase them. After spending so much time defending the humanity of the friends I had grown to love in my school, I finally got a glimpse of the kind of world we could live in. Best Buddies’ goal is to run their organization out of business by creating a  world so welcoming and accepting that an organization creating inclusive spaces would no longer be necessary—they would exist naturally all around us.
We tried to create this world at my high school. One important step was the Spread the Word to End the Word campaign my school participated in each year. It was meant to stop the use of the “R” word because, believe it or not, words hurt people.
Throughout the years, the “R” word has developed negative connotations. People use it in place of words like stupid, dumb, ridiculous, crazy, and countless other negative words. This implies that people with intellectual disabilities are all these things. Throughout my years in Best Buddies, I had to see my friends excluded from so many social spaces because of the hostile environment created for them through all the negative views stacked against them. I had to witness the smile fade away from one of my best friend’s face as he told me about the way some of my classmates made him leave their lunch table. The need for a campaign asking people to say, “this person has an intellectual disability,” instead of, “this person is mentally r*******,” became obvious.
Through Best Buddies, I was presented with more appropriate terminology, terminology that defined people by their status as a person and not their disability. Best Buddies gave me my first real introduction to political correctness. It provided me with the proper language to help ensure my friends were being treated with the respect they deserved. Never in a million years would I have thought that being in favor of it was a sign of weakness or coddling. The whole thing is quite reasonable. If something you say makes another person uncomfortable or feel less than others, why would you continue to say it?
If you suddenly saw one child hit another, you wouldn’t yell at the child who was hurt for being upset. You would tell the other child to stop. The same concept applies. “PC culture” is about avoiding verbal abuse, just as people should avoid physical abuse.
Opponents of political correctness argue that it is an attack on free speech. They argue that, in addition to limiting the oppressor by not allowing them to attack others, it also affects the oppressed by preventing them from welcoming different opinions, therefore stunting their capability for intellectual growth.
Why should we welcome opinions that intentionally discredit who we are? Being politically correct doesn’t hurt anyone. You’re not going to feel bad because there haven’t been enough racial slurs yelled at you this week.
It wouldn’t affect a person who will never be on the receiving end of those slurs. But rejecting political correctness does hurt individuals. It’s not just about not liking what we hear because we don’t agree with it. These hateful words are bullets that slowly tear down at our humanity with every shot fired.
The argument that silencing hateful speech would hurt me more because I wouldn’t be able to grow intellectually absolutely baffles me. Do you know what actually has a direct effect on a person’s ability to perform academically? Their mental health. Emotional well-being is the real prerequisite for intellectual growth. Having to listen to hateful slurs because people don’t listen to your calls to end the use of dehumanizing language is what tears it down bit by bit.
Opponents call for educated discussion by asking that all emotional attachment to the issues to be left out. We can’t be objective in issues that deal with our humanity. Anything we could possibly contribute on the topic would be inherently subjective. There is no way to disconnect the two. You can’t leave your identity at the door for what are thought of as purely intellectual discussions.
The disconnect here is that ideas and opinions cannot be held to the same caliber as their negative impact on human lives. I’m not sorry that you feel like you can’t freely express your prejudiced thoughts—not when you want to do so at the expense of another person’s existence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the graduation of the Class of 2018, Harvard’s American Repertory Theater Institute will close its doors for three years in order to “work on a strategic plan,” according to an email sent to Institute alumni and students earlier this month.
This decision follows the A.R.T. Institute’s move in January to freeze admissions for the next year after the U.S. Department of Education listed the Institute—which offers two-year graduate programs in acting, dramaturgy, and voice pedagogy—as one of hundreds of college programs failing to meet federal standards for student debt.
In the email, sent to students and alumni of the Institute, A.R.T. Artistic Director Diane M. Paulus ’88 wrote that the Institute will “work with Harvard to explore options for an MFA, establish a stronger base of financial support for the Institute, and improve the A.R.T.’s educational facilities as part of an overall renovation of the Loeb Drama Center.”
A.R.T. Producer Diane Borger said the Institute did not take the decision to shutter lightly, but described addressing the concerns that she said were shared by Institute leadership and students as “the most responsible thing” to do.
“To do these things properly and rigorously, it takes time,” Borger said.
The January decision by the Education Department was the result of Obama-era legislation that sought to target predatory for-profit colleges and degree programs that saddle graduates with unmanageable levels of student debt.
Two years of tuition at the A.R.T. Institute cost around $62,500. The Department of Education estimated that A.R.T. Institute graduates earn, on average, around $36,000 per year—a debt-to-earnings ratio of 44 percent. Under federal guidelines, that ratio—the proportion of income that, after accounting for basic expenses, goes to debt payment—must be under 20 percent.
The Education Department focused part of its investigation on degree programs that award “certificates” instead of traditional master’s degrees. From 1999 to 2016, A.R.T. Institute graduates received a Master of Fine Arts from Moscow Art Theater School and a certificate from Harvard University. The Classes of 2017 and 2018 receive Master of Liberal Arts degree from the Harvard Extension School.
The news has concerned some students in the program, who worry about both the affordability of the program and the impact its closing could have on their careers.
“All the negative attention the Institute is receiving might be conflated with the education of the Institute for Advanced Theatre Training somehow being diminished. That is certainly not the case,” Jesse Friedman, a member of the Institute’s Class of 2018, said.
Other students, though, are nonplussed. Charlotte Stoiber, a recent graduate of the Institute, said the acting profession places more emphasis on performance than credentials.
“If I had done my M.B.A. at Harvard and Harvard Business School was going through a hiatus, I would be a lot more worried,” she said. “It’s only important to me that I went to a program this good because it made me good for the audition.”
Students in the program said that debt has long been a problem for them and welcomed any changes that would make the school more affordable.
Me’Lisa Sellers, a current student who has advocated for financial aid policy reform, said that many of her peers are struggling with burdensome student loans.
“If you’re not doing anything to aid them, then they’re becoming victims of the same policy that has been found negligent,” she said.
Last year, all A.R.T. Institute students—regardless of financial need—were given a $2,500 scholarship, according to two students in the Institute. In financial aid letters distributed two months ago, the Institute increased these student scholarships to $14,500.
Sellers argued this was not enough to relieve what she called “debilitating” debt, sometimes greater than $135,000.
Borger said administrators were trying to keep a “very open mind” about the upcoming process. Students, alumni, donors, and representatives of other graduate theater programs will be involved in the process, she added.
Though A.R.T. Institute Director Scott Zigler will leave in June 2018 to become dean of the drama school at the University of North Carolina School for the Arts, Borger said she believes “his wisdom and his experience” will help guide the transition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber—a pioneer in the field of nanotechnology—was named the first Joshua and Beth Friedman University Professor, Harvard’s highest faculty rank, the University announced on Thursday. His position is effective July 1.
Lieber has made numerous advances in the field of nanoscale bio-electronics, developing nanoscale wire-like structures with applications in fields as diverse as electronics, nanocomputing, neurobiology, and medicine. He created a new type of electrical implant, called syringe-injectable mesh nanoelectronics, that enables the implant’s interface to function like sensors in the brain.
In an interview with the University-run Harvard Gazette, University President Drew G. Faust said Lieber is “an extraordinary scientist whose work has transformed nanoscience and nanotechnology and has led to a remarkable range of valuable applications that improve the quality of people’s lives.”
A professor at Harvard since 1991, he was appointed Chemistry and Chemical Biology department chair in 2015. He also holds a joint appointment with the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. He has won several awards for his research, including the Von Hippel Award, the Wolf Prize in Chemistry, and the National Institute of Health’s Pioneer Award.
He received his bachelor's degree at Franklin and Marshall College and his Ph.D. at Stanford University. Lieber also taught at Columbia University before coming to Harvard. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
The University Professorship was established by Joshua S. Friedman ’76, a co-founder of hedge fund Canyon Partners, and philanthropist Beth C. Friedman. Joshua Friedman also serves on the Harvard Management Company board of directors—the 11-member body that oversees the investment of the University’s $35.7 billion endowment.
Faculty are designated University Professors in recognition of significant academic accomplishment.
With Lieber’s appointment, 26 faculty members currently hold University professorships including former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers, African American studies intellectual Henry Louis Gates Jr., constitutional law scholar Laurence H. Tribe ’62, and political theorist Danielle S. Allen.
The renowned chemistry scholar’s newest accolade, however, is only one of his many accomplishments. In 2014, Lieber grew the biggest pumpkin in Massachusetts at a prize-winning 1870 pounds.
Lieber was not immediately available for comment.
