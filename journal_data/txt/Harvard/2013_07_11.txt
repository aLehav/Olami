After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts—This summer, I’m counting trees.  Or at least, that’s the way one of my friends likes to put it.
People are often amused when they hear I do vaguely-tree-related work.  After all, who does stuff with trees?  Isn’t that so, like, 18th century?  Well, I'm doing an internship at a startup, I tell them.  So basically, people have no idea what I actually do.  I'm doing coding, I tell them.  So basically, people have no idea what I actually do (they just smile and nod).  Maybe if I just lied and said I was working for Facebook then I would sound a lot cooler.  But before you assume this is my questionably legit, desperate-for-a-job summer “job,” let me try to clarify.
I’m working at a Cambridge-based startup called “SilviaTerra” (Google it, it’s real, I swear).  I suppose they count trees, in a sense; they develop software tools to make forestry much cheaper and more accurate.  I randomly stumbled upon this opportunity after intending but failing to fill out any summer internship applications during Wintersession.  Now, my summer project is to build one of SilviaTerra’s new tools, an Android app with some web components.  Moral of the story: procrastinate and good things will happen to you.  Always.
The small startup vibe, though, is definitely one of productivity.  It’s so much harder to procrastinate in the office when the office is roughly 12-feet by 12-feet and the only other people inside are the two co-founders (and occasionally one of their friends, although that might be pushing the room’s occupancy limit a little).  That’s why, of course, when I need to do something less than relevant (like write my Crimson postcards!) I “work from home” that day.  On a serious note, this is actually one of the beauties of coding that I’ve come to appreciate greatly—the flexibility to get your work done on your own time and to make up any work missed outside a stiff 9-to-5 routine.
Before settling into the work itself, though, I had to figure out how to get to work.  Of course, as a helpless Boston resident, my options for transit are walk, bike, bus, or T.  I ultimately decided on the bike—it seemed like what all the cool kids were doing (and besides, I’ve needed a bike ever since I found out I got Quad-ed).  Now, to be honest, coming from an area where distances are almost always measured in driving time, I wasn’t entirely sure what such a daily commute would be like.  As a bicyclist, you weave through impatient city drivers, pedaling right next to them as they attempt to improve how fast they can make turns or get through before the lights turn red.  Then there are the no-cares-given pedestrians you also have to avoid.  And with my lack of coordination and/or awareness, this could prove to be a serious problem.  I’m still kind of paranoid that I might wind up needing medical attention.  My goal this summer is to not fall off my bike.
Anyways, the commute itself takes me from Beacon Street straight through MIT to Central.  Every day, I bike across a bridge over the Charles that connects Boston and Cambridge.  For those movie aficionados out there, it’s actually the same bridge that Ben Campbell bikes on in the beginning of “21.”  My daily commute isn’t nearly as picturesque, though—I’m not sure if it’s just the Hollywood veneer or if somebody seriously ugly-ed up the bridge since that movie was filmed.  It’s full of potholes and strangely-shaped bumps, especially on the bike path (complicating my “don’t fall off” summer goal).  Nor is it nearly as fun and relaxing as it might sound, this whole quixotic concept of biking to work and all—most of the time it’s just me struggling to move my out-of-shape self over a (sadly) relatively short distance.  Unfortunately, the bridge is also inclined.
But at least now I can tell people I bike three miles a day.  Surely that’ll impress them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
KIGALI, Rwanda—The state of any community is ephemeral: never perfectly recorded, always changing. I am repeatedly struck, though, by just how much this is true of Kigali. It is developing so rapidly that a student returning after a year or two abroad can barely recognize the city center. Few bother to make maps, as they are inevitably out-of-date by the time they are printed. The city's complex transit infrastructure is mapped only in the collective conscience of its passengers—most of whom only know a small segment of it.
History is often very visible in this place, and painfully so: the homeless man with no limbs, the street salesman with a dent in his head. This legacy is one Rwandans are determined to never forget. With time, though, the rest is fading away: old landmarks are slowly superseded by names that are more meaningful in the present. Minibus drivers alter their routes to pass new developments, leaving no trace of the old way. Shops close and are replaced by new ones. Today's Kigali is different from yesterday's, and it will be different again tomorrow.
Part of me wants to lament the information that was lost to oblivion, but another part is fascinated and wants to sit back and watch it all happen. Maybe this is just what progress looks like—and here, of all places, there is a lot to move past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing financial constraints, Harvard Medical School will cut 31 custodial contract jobs, a move that has prompted criticism from the labor union that represents the workers and the circulation of an online petition opposing the decision.
The cuts, which will take effect on August 17, stem from the cancellation of the Medical School’s approximately six-and-a-half-year-old contract with American Cleaning Company, Inc., a Brighton-based subcontractor that services the Medical School. Harvard notified American Cleaning Company of its plans last month.
About 90 people currently hold custodial jobs at the Medical School, according to Richard M. Shea, the Medical School’s associate dean for campus planning and facilities. The approximately 60 remaining workers, who are employed by the Medical School rather than an outside subcontractor, will keep their jobs when the cuts take effect next month.
As reasoning behind the cuts, Shea cited the need to address the Medical School’s “high operating deficit,” which he said is projected to total about $40 million for the 2013 fiscal year. He estimated that the 31 cut jobs could save the Medical School up to $1 million.
“It’s never easy to do anything like this, because they’re people—we care about that,” Shea said, explaining that it was important to try to keep the jobs of the custodians that the Medical School hires directly.
Still, Service Employees International Union Local 615, the labor union that represents both the custodial workers hired directly by the Medical School and those contracted through American Cleaning Company, has spoken out against the decision.
Following Harvard’s notification, the union began soliciting signatures in an online petition expressing opposition to the cuts, according to Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for SEIU Local 615. The petition, which Langley said is also being distributed in paper form, says that the cuts “would be effectively trimming the budget on the backs of [the Medical School’s] lowest-paid workers.”
Barbara Bastardo, a custodial worker at the Medical School contracted through American Cleaning Company, said she reacted to the news that she would lose her job with incredulity.
“How could it be that a University as prestigious and as rich as Harvard doesn’t have enough money to pay the lowest-paid workers within the institution?” Bastardo said in Spanish through a translator.
However, Gina Vild, associate dean for communications and external relations at the Medical School, wrote in an email that the claim that the custodial workers are the Medical School’s lowest-paid workers is incorrect.
In a phone interview Monday, Langley suggested that the cuts demonstrate an “anti-worker bias,” arguing that Harvard should cut executives’ salaries rather than the workers’ jobs. He added that he considers the differentiation between the workers hired by the Medical School and contracted through American Cleaning Company an “artificial distinction,” noting that both groups of workers are paid the same wages, which Vild confirmed.
Shea said the Medical School is evaluating its operations across the board to address the operating deficit. With fewer custodial workers, Shea said there may be changes to cleaning standards, such as the frequency with which the trash is emptied. Adding that the details are still being worked out, Vild wrote that the current Medical School custodians “are not being asked to take on additional duties.”
The cuts are not the first sign of financial worries at the Medical School this year. The Medical School’s operating deficit for the 2012 fiscal year was $28.8 million, according to the Boston Globe. And in April, when the Medical School announced the closure of its New England Primate Research Center—which became the source of controversy after the death of several primates—it also cited financial constraints.

Harvard bros should hang their heads in shame. According to Yelp, frequenters of Harvard Square are less likely to use the term "frat" in their reviews than patrons downtown and around the Boston University campus.
The site has pooled its vast collection of more than 39 million local reviews of restaurants, shops, and other businesses to create Wordmaps—heat maps which demonstrate the prevalence of certain keywords in reviews of establishments around major cities worldwide. Instances of a given word are shaded in red on a Google map. The more fiery the color, the more frequently that keyword appears in reviews. On each map Yelp has helpfully provided a pre-set list of keywords for each city. For Boston, they include some of our favorite (and least favorite) terms, ranging from "chowder" and "cocktails" to "pbr" and "hangover."
Accordingly, the "frat" Wordmap of Boston produces a pathetic hint of red around the Square that literally pales in comparison to the bright bursts of red in Boston’s apparently more fratty enclaves. Our advice for Harvard bros: Get thyselves to a gym and tone up those biceps so that perhaps someday, that faint red will burn bright crimson.
Not surprisingly, this wasn’t the only pattern on the Boston map that was fairly predictable; uses of "pasta," for instance, were highly concentrated in the North End, known for its Italian restaurants. However, others, particularly in our neck of the woods, yielded some surprising results.
For example, the keyword "tourist" generates a fairly light shade of red around the Square. After countless attempts to circumvent the hordes unwisely touching the foot of the John Harvard statue, we at Flyby would have expected a more concentrated hue.
Though there is a fair amount of "hipster" activity around Harvard, the Allston and Brighton neighborhoods of Boston take the cake for highest density of the keyword, contrary to what the Boston Globe’s Dreamtown Finder rankings would suggest.
And vegetarians, shield your eyes. Here in Harvard Square we are apparently nestled smack in the middle of one of the great epicenters of bacon in the Boston area.
Surprises aside, the question remains: what does a concentration of a word even indicate? If there are so many reviews that mention bacon in the Square, does that mean that the local varieties of the much-loved fatty meat product are any good? A quick perusal of a few Yelp reviews reveals that users may not necessarily use a keyword in a positive light.
One disgruntled Yelp user’s review of Tasty Burger reveals that the chefs at the restaurant failed to include the bacon on his burger. The reviewer writes: "What really pissed me off though is that if they have a 'special of the day' called CHICKEN BACON RANCH burger, HOW ON EARTH is it possible to forget one of the KEY INGREDIENTS?!"
