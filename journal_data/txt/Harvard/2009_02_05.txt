After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While his classmates were completing problem sets and writing papers in the library, Jonathan C. Mostow ’83 was staying up late in the Freshman Union, loading film and editing footage until the early hours of the morning. “My passion was making film,” he said. Mostow’s passion has become a lucrative career. The director of “Terminator 3” and the upcoming “Swiss Family Robinson” is one of many alums who have moved out West to strike gold in Hollywood. From Darren S. Aronofsky ’91—director of the Academy Award-nominated “The Wrestler”—to Jeffrey A. Zucker ’86—former president of the Crimson and current president and CEO of NBC— alums of the College pervade the entertainment industry, writing, directing and producing successful mainstream and independent works.And while aspiring filmmakers may not graduate with the level of technical competency as their peers at the film schools at the University of Southern California (USC) or New York University (NYU), Harvard is still able to enable strong Hollywood careers through the broad, liberal arts education it encourages and the connections it provides. For current students looking to work in Hollywood, the Harvard name opens doors to an industry that has proven notoriously hard to crack. “Harvard is an invaluable resource. It creates an instant connect and instant trust,” said Madeleine Bennett ’11, president of the undergraduate chapter of Harvardwood, a non-profit organization for Harvard students, alums, and staff interested in careers on or behind the silver screen. But the formalized, extensive alumni network that now supports current students was not always in place. Years ago, informal networks were predominant—and for some alums, these structures remain in use more today. Nevertheless, as students grapple with a hemorrhaging economy, personal connections of any sort borne of a Harvard-affiliation may prove increasingly important. THE ADVANTAGES OF AN ELITE EDUCATIONInstead of solely focusing on the mechanics of the trade, students at the College are forced to divide their time between the application of their art and the books. Many current filmmakers, however, elected to focus on Harvard’s other curricular resources during their undergraduate years, even when they knew that cinema was the next step.“I knew coming in that I was going to spend my whole life doing film, and I wanted to spend my time at college doing something else,” said screenwriter and director Marshall I. Lewy ’99, whose movie “Blue State” premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2007. At Harvard, Lewy shied away from the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, instead delving into Russian and American novels and earning a degree in History and Literature. Lewy chose to later complement his undergraduate experience with a Masters of Fine Arts from Columbia, but he cites his broad Harvard education as providing him with important perspective for his work today. “I’m working on a fair number of projects where history comes into play,” he said. Other aspiring filmmakers opt to make their art the focus of their college education. But even at its most technical, Harvard’s film program is not pre-professional. The VES department, through the courses it offers, requires students to complement their practical knowledge of the field with a strong philosophical understanding of the craft. “Students use the camera to explore and interrogate the world for the stories, issues and characters it might reveal,” explained VES Professor Robb Moss, acting head of undergraduate studies and film production professor.  While much of the program centers on the hands-on aspects of cinema—such as the complexities of working with 16mm film—its curriculum forces students to draw upon cinematic history and theory, said Moss.“The [film] program socializes film and...integrates it into the rest of my learning,” said Isidore M. T. Bethel ’11, a VES concentrator who recently completed his first feature film, “Terminus.” Students said that VES’s approach to film allows them to acquire both the competence and the resolve necessary for cinema and that the department encourages students to take responsibility for their work. “From beginning to end, what you make is yours,” said Rachel M. Douglas ’09, a VES concentrator and Crimson editor.Whereas Harvard’s program approaches production from a survey-like perspective, film schools often divide areas of study by sets of filmmaking skills, such as screenwriting and acting. “If you know you want to be a cinematographer or a sound editor... you have a great opportunity [at USC] to get lots of practical experience in those areas,” said Justin Wilson, USC’s Director of Alumni Relations. This has practical importance. “You have got something to show when you leave [school],” said Mark J. Harris ’63, Distinguished Professor in USC’s School of Cinematic Arts and three-time Academy Award winning documentary maker.But according to Harris, although a more technical education strengthens practical skills, it may detract from students’ creative ability. “When people leave NYU, they are technical masters but sometimes their ideas fall short,” said Michael F. Crommett, a freshman at NYU’s Tisch School.“My own bias is that you shouldn’t go to film school as an undergraduate,” Harris said. “It’s a better idea to go to a liberal arts school and develop something to say.” BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITYWhile Harvard’s liberal arts education may provide the intellectual rudiments helpful for aspiring filmmakers, it predictably has far fewer alumni in Hollywood than film schools. Wilson estimated that the vast majority of USC’s graduates are concentrated in Southern California. “People talk of the ‘USC mafia.’ We like to think of it more as a family,” said Wilson. “If you look at a lot of projects in film, television, etc. many USC alumni have worked on them.” The school itself cultivates these professional relationships with alumni events and job listings, he said.  Harvardwood—financially independent of the University—attempts to promote a similar film community for students and alums. Founded in 1999 by Mia E. Riverton ’99, the organization provides a centralized hub through which its approximately 3000 members can forge new connections, facilitating the transition from the classroom to the studio. Harvardwood arranges conferences and seminars while compiling alumni contact information in an online directory, accessible to all members. Harvardwood 101—a yearly trip to Los Angeles over that takes place over intersession—offers two dozen current students a glimpse at the industry they hope to enter. Last month, students on the trip met with a wide range of professionals—from agents and writers to Robert M. Kraft ’76, the chief executive of Fox Music. “We were bussed around from studio to studio, panel to panel in order to experience a broad cross-section of Hollywood,” said Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11. As they learned about the ins and outs of Hollywood (“Screaming bosses are a big thing out there,” said Fitzpatrick), students also tried their hand at networking. “The whole trip is about meeting people, specifically Harvard alums,” said Maxwell A. Newman-Plotnick ’11, a VES concentrator who also traveled to Los Angeles. He said he may use the connections established on the trip to help him find an internship this summer. Today, $40 in annual dues to Harvardwood unveils myriad potential connections, but in the mid-80s—when the current generation of Hollywood executives and producers moved to Hollywood after graduation—few previous alums had established themselves in the industry. The Harvard diploma meant little more than the absence of a film degree. “When I first came out here, you could count the Harvard people on two hands,” Mostow said. “Moving to Hollywood was like running off to join the circus.”The networks of these early pioneers were more closed and exclusive than they are at present. Their connections stemmed from shared college experiences, such as House affiliation and extracurriculars, rather than any official organization. One such focal point was the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. The Lampoon name, Mostow said, was a Hollywood calling card. It granted access to a social group of Hollywood professionals—mainly comedy writers—including admittance to a weekly poker night.For some of the more seasoned alums, these strong personal networks may have superceded their affiliation with Harvardwood. While Mostow has collaborated with his college roommate on many films, including “The Swiss Family Robinson,” he does not belong to Harvardwood. And R.J. Cutler, a filmmaker who recently won the Grand Jury Prize for Excellence in Cinematography for a U.S. documentary, works with Harvard alums on most of his films but had never even heard of the group. APOCALYPSE NOW?As Hollywood fades in the face of a shrinking economy, this Harvard network may prove a valuable asset for filmmakers.  “When the situation changes economically, most people network more,” said Benny J. Belvin, one of two OCS counselors who accompanied Harvardwood on their trip.Although it is too early to fully determine the effects of the shriveling market on the film industry, disappearing funds and dwindling deals have raised fears across Hollywood. Current filmmakers have said they plan to choose their future projects by focusing on scripts with the most box office potential. “There is an intense amount of focus on the projects that are truly worthwhile,” said producer Benjamin S. Forkner ’01, whose film “The Killing Room” premiered at this year’s Sundance.  But growing uncertainty in Hollywood is not enough to curb the allure of the silver screen for some current undergraduates. “I want to be a film director,” said Newman-Plotnick, “although I am keenly aware that it is extraordinarily hard to find a job in that industry [even] in a good economy.” And despite the dimming lights, the Harvard presence in Hollywood continues to grow. “Now more than ever,” Lewy said, “Hollywood is not the fringe direction for Harvard graduates that it was 20 years ago.” —Anita B.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Years before President Drew G. Faust created the Task Force on the Arts in 2007 to examine the role that arts plays at Harvard, the Freshman Seminar Program was already responding to a perceived change in the student body: their increased interest in artistic endeavors.The Task Force, comprised of faculty, students, and professional artists associated with the Harvard community, released a report last December emphasizing the value of the arts in research institutions such as Harvard. According to Faust, the findings called for an end to the “‘curricular banishment of the arts,” and has generated much anticipation for a greater presence of the arts in academic offerings.However, the Freshman Seminar Program—which is entering its 50th year—had already begun to broaden arts-oriented curricular opportunities for freshman. These seminars, which typically are capped at a dozen or so students, provide incoming undergraduates with the chance to engage with faculty while exploring a specific subject. The program strives to emphasize humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences equally. Over the past decade, the program has expanded quickly, growing from 33 courses in the 2000-2001 academic year to 132 this academic year. Recently, it has added more creative arts and studio based courses to its selection, a process that has occurred in conjunction with the creation of the Task Force.Mya M. Mangawang, who will teach her first freshman seminar entitled “Compulsion to Photograph,” this spring, believes that small class sizes are critical to enriching the study of arts on campus. Mangawang is new to the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. Her hiring is part of a trend of employing young faculty to teachfreshman seminars that, according to the Program’s Department Administrator, Corinna S. Rohse.“It’s a sign of the hiring in [the Music and Visual and Environmental Studies] departments,” says Rohse. “One of the first things they do is encourage [new faculty] to teach freshmen seminars, because how better to bring new students into your discipline than by putting together some young and new exciting faculty with young and new exciting students?” To Rohse, many of the studio-based seminars have a notable sense of energy and excitement. “We have a special love of studio seminars and the other small literature-based seminars, which don’t have as high a profile as some of the other seminars out there do,” says Rohse. “But they have a very keen group of students.” Damon H. Krukowski, who teaches the popular studio-based seminar “Noisy Art,” believes that the intimate structure of freshman seminars is conducive to the artistic process. His seminar, which incorporates various media into the goal of making art from noise, is an example of one of the creative courses that has been a staple of the program ever since it began to expand. “There’s an aspect of play in the arts that seems to match a goal of the seminar program,” he wrote in an e-mail. “I think of my seminar course as an invitation, rather than an introduction.”Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, director of the Freshman Seminar Program, notes that the influx of studio-based freshman seminars is a result of the program’s commitment to anticipate student interest by providing a wide variety of courses. While bolstering its offerings, the program has been actively engaged in providing classes that integrate elements of the creative arts. “What we hope most for in the freshmen seminars,” Naddaff says, “is that students will have curricular experiences that broaden their horizons in some way.” Though the VES department offers many studio-based courses, non-concentrators often find it difficult to get accepted into them. Thus, the opportunity for freshmen to take classes taught by VES faculty is another reason Naddaff feels it is important to offer these first-year seminars. “It is a way for students who are not concentrating in VES to have the experience of a studio course they might not otherwise get,” Naddaff says. Rohse says freshman seminars are a means for incoming undergraduates to experiment with new and unexplored subject matter. She has noticed that students often discover a new passion and then decide to concentrate in that area. In fact, according to Krukowski, a number of VES concentrators took “Noisy Art” in their freshman year. These concentrators include both students who were already familiar with the material, as well as those who had no experience with VES before. “Some certainly knew they would be in VES beforehand,” he says, “but others came to the seminar without previous studio experience—just curiosity...both those groups of students bring an equally important element to the seminar mix.”—Staff writer Melanie E.

After two consecutive years of performing the standard Mozartian fare, the Dunster House Opera Society is about to strut new feathers with Igor Stravinsky’s underperformed, yet influential, neoclassical opera “The Rake’s Progress.” It is DHO policy to alternate between more classical productions and either contemporary or lesser-known work every few years; however, co-producer Clara H. Kim ’09 said that the cast and crew confronted various challenges while staging this modern piece, which conforms to the Mozart model in its organizational structure but strays from those constraints with an offbeat musical content in keeping with Stravinsky’s rhythmic innovations.  “We had some reservations because of the difficulty of the vocal writing, which can be virtuosic and unidiomatic at times, and also the difficulty of the orchestra parts,” Kim said. “However, it was our first choice from almost the beginning of the selection process because of the quality of the libretto, the varied and interesting storyline, and the attractiveness of the music.” “The Rake’s Progress” is based on a series of mid-18th century paintings by William Hogarth that Stravinsky viewed in Chicago. Stravinsky collaborated with two poets, W.H. Auden and Chester Kallman, to develop the drawings into an operatic plot line. Considering that the DHO only performs operas in English, stage director Victoria J. Crutchfield ’10 said it was especially helpful that they were able to retain the libretto in its native language and maintain the integrity of the plot and character development.“The characters are archetypes, but they are not limited to those conventions particularly because of Auden’s poetry,” she said. “They never say anything that sounds generic. Everything they say is interesting.”The basic plot line traces the downfall of the protagonist Tom Rakewell (James B. Onstad ’09), who leaves his sweetheart, Anne Trulove (Eva E.M. Schlitz ’09), and the comforts of the quiet countryside behind for the alluring delights and debauchery of London after coming into an unexpected inheritance. A mysterious character by the name of Nick Shadow (Davone J. Tines ’09) guides Tom into further ruin until Tom is eventually destitute and cursed to insanity. “Tom is an unsavory character actually, but in many ways he is very human,” Onstad said. “At least his faults are very human, and a lot of the mistakes that he makes are mistakes that all of us make in one time or another.” Despite the opera’s tragic undertones, Crutchfield said she admired the strength of characters such as Anne. “Anne is an active opera heroine as opposed to a passive ‘I have consumption at the end of the opera’ heroine,” she said.Schlitz also enjoyed portraying a character with an emotional range that was malleable from the show’s start to finish. “Anne starts out very young and naïve, and she believes that love is going to conquer everything,” Schlitz said. “[But] in this production, she has a lot of strength and comes into her own by the end.” Unlike the straightforward and approachable libretto, many still regard the music itself as a significant challenge for the performers and the audience alike. With musical content that is strikingly 20th century, music director Yuga J. Cohler ’11 notes that devices such as irregular and syncopated rhythms contribute to the rather bizarre quality of the music, which is neither completely dissonant nor exclusively modern. “Stravinsky wrote it in a more convoluted way than was necessary,” Cohler said. However, Crutchfield believes that the challenging nature of the music will not prevent audiences from enjoying the overall production, especially those who are ordinarily fond of Stravinsky’s compositions.“The music is not immediately accessible, but it is something that grows on you,” Crutchfield said. “I didn’t appreciate it as much when I first listened to it as I do now. A lot of people like Stravinsky, and I think they will like this.” The Dunster House Opera Society will open its debut show tonight at 8:30, with other performances following on Sunday and continuing into the next weekend.—Staff writer Eunice Y.

With the American economy in crisis and once attractive investment and consulting jobs looking less than their best, students are exploring diverse career options, and the University wants to help. Instead of focusing on the well-known possibility of a move to Wall Street after graduation, the two-day event “Passion for the Arts” will explore the broad range of careers in the arts and humanities. The event begins today at 4:30 in Sanders Theatre with speakers Yo-Yo Ma ’76, President Drew G. Faust, and Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt followed tomorrow by a career panel and student group fair in the Science Center. Diana Sorensen, the Dean of Arts and Humanities, and her department spearheaded the event, sensing a need to provide possible careers in the arts a more visible position on campus.“One of the things we could do better is connect the kinds of courses we teach with a life after Harvard,” Sorenson says, “and show how people who have studied in the arts or humanities have gone on to productive careers.” Sorensen wants students to explore the best this liberal arts university has to offer, which includes engaging in opportunities from the natural sciences to the performing arts. Sara Oseasohn ’74, GSD ’77, the Associate Dean for Administration for the Arts and Humanities, hopes that they can host a similar event every year to help students who are trying to decide what concentrations, courses, and activities to participate in.  The Arts and Humanities office has hosted smaller events geared toward putting students in dialogue with people who have careers in the arts and humanities, but this year they wanted to expand their outreach by staging a larger event. On the heels of his inauguration performance, Ma will kick off the event this afternoon as he discusses his career in the arts. “Yo-Yo Ma’s invitation is connected with his incredible charisma as a musician,” Sorensen says, “but also the wonderful things he has to say about the world of the arts not only in education but in promoting cultural exchange and a different sense of understanding the world.” Ma’s participation in the event is a continuation of his involvement in the arts at Harvard as an undergraduate and with the Task Force, and as the inspiration for Greenblatt’s “English 127: A Silk Road Course: Travel and Transformation on the High Seas: An Imaginary Journey in the Early 17th Century” and Harvard’s other Silk Road courses. Ma’s Silk Road Project brings together musicians from all over the world and influenced these courses, which focus on global expressions of art. President Faust and Professor Greenblatt will continue the discussion with a focus on the future of the arts at Harvard, exploring the ways in which the recommendations of the Task Force will be implemented. Although the event’s focus is on the career possibilities in the arts and humanities, Greenblatt notes that the development of course offerings is tied to career choice. “The first goal of the Task Force is to move art-making from the extracurricular sphere to the curricular sphere,” Greenblatt says. “The purpose of doing that is connected to many things, including the careers of students.”Students will also have the opportunity to learn more about student groups that are involved in the arts and humanities after Saturday’s career panel. Over 40 student groups will be in the Science Center lobby, available to provide information about their organizations. Further opportunities to explore career options in the arts and humanities can be found through the Office of Career Services (OCS), a co-sponsor of the event. This past fall, OCS began an initiative with the theme of “turning up the volume” on diverse career options. “The reason we call it ‘turning up the volume’ is from all the ads you see in The Crimson of investment banks and consulting firms,” OCS director Robin Mount says, “and they make a lot of noise, so we wanted to turn up the noise on the other side too.”Particpants in the career panel include sports journalist Sally Jenkins, filmmaker Gary Ross, and law professor Noah R. Feldman ’92, who is helping to draft the Iraqi constitution.Beyond the opportunities to learn about careers in the arts and humanities, Greenblatt is excited about today’s event as a valuable opportunity to hear from Yo-Yo Ma. “Much as I admire, as I do deeply, Drew Faust, and as much as I take myself seriously, I think the first reason to go is to encounter Yo-Yo Ma,” Greenblatt says. “He is a truly astonishing figure and a really great musician and a great human being. That is just an occasion by itself. That’s certainly what I’m in it for. Any time spent with Yo-Yo Ma is time well spent.” —Staff writer Melanie E. Long can be reached at long2@fas.harvard.edu.

Elementary school classrooms are filled with impressionable young minds learning how to add, multiply, and divide; but few of these students will ever understand the logic and the theory behind their calculations. The works of Plato, Euclid, and Newton, upon which all of modern science and commerce depend, are as much philosophical statements about the structure of the universe as they are mathematical treatises. In “Is God a Mathematician?” Mario Livio attempts to impress upon the reader this fundamental connection between math and philosophy while presenting a “greatest hits” summary of man’s foremost mathematical achievements.
Livio concedes on his first page that the notion of God as a mathematician is “neither a philosophical attempt to define God… nor a shrewd scheme to intimidate math phobics.” Instead, Livio is trying to entice lay readers to crack open his book and appreciate the “omnipresence and omnipotent powers of mathematics.” Its focus is the impressive notion that “the same global, coherent mathematics” can be used by a wide variety of scientists, engineers, economists, and doctors to explain such seemingly divergent topics as factory efficiency and the structure of the universe. Livio attempts to account for these seemingly unrelated applications of math by creating an historical narrative about how mathematicians throughout time have interpreted the “underlying mathematical facility” that appears to govern man’s existence.
Livio’s biggest hurdle to overcome with “Is God a Mathematician?” is making over two millennia of high-level mathematical discoveries accessible to the reader who has never studied the more inscrutable and elaborate non-Euclidean geometry or knot theory. And it would seem that if anyone is primed for success in this difficult endeavor, it’s Livio, who is both an astrophysicist and the head of the Office of Public Outreach at the Hubble Space Telescope Institute. But while his approach is appealing to any curious reader, his inability to draw concrete conclusions is frustrating for even the most forgiving one.
Livio struggles to answer the fundamental question of whether mathematicians have “discovered” the universe’s laws or the laws of mathematics were “invented” by mathematicians. Reaching back to the sixth century B.C., Livio uses Pythagoras, Plato, and Archimedes to demonstrate that there is an intimate relationship between the most basic arithmetic and much more complicated and inaccessible abstract logic. Revelations abound, from the logical basis for counting, to the foundation of prime numbers, and the Pythagorean Theorem. But there are an equal number of instances where Livio’s explanations fall short, such as when he discusses knots or how gravity operates in the solar system. In these cases, Livio loses himself in the history of the discoveries and overwhelms the reader with superfluous information and terminology.
“Is God a Mathematician?” is driven by Livio’s love for math and his personal desire to share his awe at its power to explain worldly phenomena. Despite his passion, both Livio’s writing and argument are uneven. At times his prose reads like a history textbook, at others like a review of the latest research in astrophysics. Belying his vigorous attempt to write to the reader, Livio struggles in vain to include sufficient background information necessary for the average reader to match his own remarkable comprehension and unique enthusiasm.
This gap between Livio and his readers is exacerbated by his failure to reach a satisfying conclusion in the closing pages of “Is God a Mathematician?”. After lauding mathematics as the key to understanding the universe for eight chapters, Livio writes that “mathematics is indeed extraordinarily effective for some descriptions, especially those dealing with fundamental science, but it cannot describe our universe in all its dimensions.” He explains that the predictive and explanatory powers of mathematics have been amplified by scientists who choose to work on problems that they know are “amenable to a mathematical treatment.” While this may be accurate, it is a frustrating and unexpected end that contradicts much of what Livio argues for in the earlier sections of his book.
Readers looking to glean divine revelations about the relationship between mathematics and the universe’s structure will be sorely disappointed by “Is God a Mathematician?” Livio leaves the reader with the ambiguous notion that mathematics is in part developed by the mathematicians who study it and also inherent to the natural world around us, waiting to be discovered by intrepid and persistent minds. 
Livio is most successful in communicating a deep respect for the power of mathematics and the intellectually rigorous theory behind it that many will never understand. By opening the door to mathematical theory, “Is God a Mathematician?” casts doubt on the absolute truths of arithmetic and geometry that are taught in school and brings Livio one step closer to making enthusiastic readers appreciate the wonder and sophistication of abstract math.

“The Civil War will not go away,” Marc Egnal begins his new book, “Clash of Extremes: The Economic Origins of the Civil War.” This grand statement strikes the reader with the relevance and importance of his argument right from the start.
The argument—that the Civil War was caused more by economic changes than the glaring issue of slavery—goes to the heart of a historiographical tendency that Egnal rightly sees as dangerous. People have come to see slavery as the cause of the war, he argues, because this provides them with a comforting myth that helps present the history of the United States as simply the progress of liberty and democracy. The Civil War won’t go away, because it shines a light on America that can be troubling, but this problem must be reconciled and not ignored, he writes.
According to Egnal, a change in the national economy brought about a realignment of American politics along a north-south axis in the decades before 1861. His cogent and engaging book serves as a timely reminder of the dangers of simplistic historical awareness.
Egnal gradually builds his argument through an analysis of the 40 years preceding the outbreak of war. He begins by outlining the model of a “national economy” that linked the producers of the South to the manufacturers of the North and helped bind regional interests. In the 1850s, however, this alliance broke down because of two factors: the rise of the antislavery movement and the development of the Great Lakes economy.
Both of these were northern-based movements and spurred the growth of the Republican Party, which promoted federal support for the northern economy and opposed the spread of slavery, culminating in the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860 and the secession of the southern states.
Egnal argues that most Americans, including many historians, have come to accept that the Republicans’ anti-slavery policies were the cause of both their popularity with the electorate and the decision of the slave-holding states to secede. He acknowledges that this was one part of their attraction but argues that economics offer a more satisfactory explanation for the party’s rise. 
The argument Egnal makes is both powerful and valid. It’s important to consider slavery from an economic, rather than a primarily ethical, standpoint. Northerners demanded that the expansion of slavery end, driven by both their moral objection to the institution and their desire to cultivate the northern industry in the West, and Lincoln only adopted the cause of immediate emancipation in 1862 due to military necessity. While it is difficult to say for sure that Egnal’s argument for the preeminence of economic factors in the outbreak of war is wholly correct, it is clear that the economic differences between the North and the South determined the political landscape of the period. 
One reason why Egnal’s interpretation of the conflict might be unfashionable is the troubling light it throws on this period of American history. More than 600,000 soldiers were killed during the Civil War, and this brutality is much easier to justify in the name of high ideals, like the preservation of each individual’s inalienable rights. If the war had economic motivations, though, this “war of liberation” becomes something much darker. Egnal calls this, “one of the tragedies of American history,” explaining that despite their moral imperative against slavery, Northern sympathy for its victims was limited.
“Myths are luxuries that no nation can afford,” Egnal says, and this message could not be more correct or relevant. Marc Egnal is right. We cannot live with the history we want; we must accept all of its complications and difficulties, no matter how hard that may be.

The first few minutes of the new FOX series, “Lie to Me,” shows a stubbly Tim Roth peering into the face of a suspected church bomber. As an expert in deception detection, Roth’s character, Dr. Cal Lightman, closely examines the suspect’s bobbing Adam’s apple, twitching moustache, and fidgeting fingers. When the suspect’s attorney impatiently states that he has instructed his client not to say anything, Lightman nonchalantly waves his hand, saying, “I don’t have a lot of faith in words myself; the average person tells three lies per ten minutes of conversation.” Behind the one-way mirror, an FBI agent gruffs, “We don’t have time for this scientist to talk to the guy.” Within a minute of this skeptical remark, Dr. Lightman determines where the suspect planted a bomb based solely on a microexpression that flits across the man’s face. A microexpression is a very brief show of genuine emotion on a person’s face. Notions such as the revealing quality of the microexpression and, more broadly, that humans have the capacity to act as virtual polygraph tests are rooted in the works of Paul Ekman—namely, his book “Telling Lies.” The book is a melange of Ekman’s own work in the field, and do-it-yourself tips to help the reader become a lie-catcher. It begins with a cursory examination of behavioral, facial, and bodily clues about deceit. For instance, when facial or bodily expressions do not match up with a person’s words, it’s highly likely that said person is lying. Ekman also explains the idea behind “leakage,” a physiognomic cousin of the microexpression, rendered aptly in the examples of a graduate student subliminally flipping off her professor during a particularly harsh performance evaluation. The author then moves to an evaluation of polygraphs as instruments of interrogation, and finally assesses more public cases of lie detection in history, like the Watergate Scandal. Unlike Roth’s character in the television series, however, Ekman comes across as less confident in his methods, or at least very cautious about putting them to use. Being responsible is one thing, but as a result of this cautiousness, Ekman often sounds vague, ambiguous, and worst of all, obvious. In distinguishing between “believing-a-lie mistake” and a “disbelieving-the-truth mistake,” he writes, “There is no general rule about which kind of mistake can be most easily avoided. Sometimes the chances of each are about the same, and sometimes one type of mistake is more likely than the other. Again, it depends upon the lie, the liar, and the lie catcher.” For those who are inspired by Roth’s charismatic and self-assured performance on “Lie to Me,” “Telling Lies” may, by comparison, seem less impressive and definitive. The fact that Ekman’s theories are often supported by fictional examples also weakens the book’s quality as a guide to catching liars in real life. In the first chapter, Ekman uses an incident between characters Jerry and Ruth in the John Updike ’54 novel, “Marry Me,” to illustrate the importance of concealing strong emotion while lying. Ekman muses on several hypothetical scenarios based on this incident in the book, but the fact that he completely manipulates the outcomes to support his points detracts from his methods.  Ekman’s case is stronger when he leans on real historical and political examples, like the exchange between Adolf Hitler and Neville Chamberlain in 1938, where the latter’s willingness to believe dictator’s promises resulted in Chamberlain’s infamous promise to his countrymen of “peace for our time.”Ekman is most compelling when he looks to his own research and experiments, and to ongoing work in the field. But this makes up only a small portion of the book. The chapter on polygraphs, their use by federal agencies and their place in the American legal system is particularly comprehensive, but the underlying conclusion that polygraphs are generally more reliable in the detection of lies than behavioral clues undermines the whole first half of the book and fails to make substantial ties with this foregoing section outside of that comparison.While Ekman’s core ideas are interesting and provide a larger picture of the role lies, lie detection, and truth all play in society, “Telling Lies” begins as a sort of “Lie Detection for Dummies” list, but ends disjointedly as an academic survey of why it is impossible to compile a list of definitive techniques for detecting deception. Nevertheless, it’s novel to see a book being credited as the basis for a television series, especially one that has such potential pop-intellectual appeal, and one that strives to bring light to significant examples of cultural and historical deception. —Reviewer Jenny J.

Ever since Janet Jackson’s infamous “wardrobe malfunction” five years ago, the Superbowl halftime show has played it safe, replacing young unpredictable rockers with the tried-and-true—wrinkles and all. From Paul McCartney to the Stones, Prince to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, geezers have been belting out 20-, 30-, even 40-year-old tunes to eager football fans. This year’s headliner, Bruce Springsteen, while clearly past his prime, doesn’t have to rely just on old, familiar hits; he is still producing quality new material. His latest album, “Working on a Dream,” may not be his finest, but The Boss has proven, yet again, that at least this old-timer can still rock.  “Working on a Dream,” like Springsteen’s other albums, features songs about the triumphs and downfalls of the low, the poor, the nobodies. Given the country’s current economic upheaval  and political change, these songs seem more relevant than ever. The title song, “Working on a Dream,” is uplifting and embodies the spirit of optimism that is prevalent throughout the album. Springsteen sings, “Though it can feel so far away / I’m working on a dream / And our love will make it real someday.”Throughout the album, Springsteen largely alternates between getting his rock on and slowing down for a softer feel. Like on Springsteen’s previous album “Magic,” the E Street Band is much more prevalent and fleshes out the songs, giving them an epic quality, like on the dark and eight-minute long opener “Outlaw Pete,” a harrowing western tale about a man unable to escape his past.While their presence is well felt, one thing noticeably absent is Clarence “Big Man” Clemens, whose sax can only be heard at the end of the track “This Life.” This appearance disappoints and fails to even come within striking distance of previous work like that on “Tenth Avenue Freeze Out.”On Springsteen’s softer songs, he continues to tap into the aesthetic of the common American, glorifying the love of everyday people in sympathetic and warmingly familiar terms. This shines through as he sings about a man in love with a supermarket worker in “Queen of the Supermarket.” This song, in collusion with a number of similarly heartfelt tracks on the album, smacks of classic Boss, poeticizing the seemingly banal and imbuing moments of tenderness into otherwise unnoteworthy situations.Surprisingly, Springsteen’s crowning achievement on the album appears as a bonus track. “The Wrestler,” which is featured at the end of the movie of the same name, paints a hauntingly beautiful picture of a broken man. Throughout the song, Springsteen claims he’s many depressing figures, including “a one armed man punching at nothing but the breeze” and that his only “faith is in the broken bones and bruises I display.” The song is deeply moving, even more so in the context of the film; that it failed to get nominated for an Oscar is an incomprehensible crime.The Boss will be turning 60 this year, but he still knows how to make a great album. “Working on a Dream” is meaningful, powerful, and thoroughly enjoyable. While he may not be producing the music he used to, no one should have been disappointed that the Boss threw in one of his new songs at the halftime show.  —Staff writer Edward F. Coleman can be reached at efcolem@fas.harvard.edu.

As the leader of Canadian supergroup The New Pornographers, Carl “A.C.” Newman has been one of the most consistently inventive and thrilling songwriters of this decade. However, the peak of his career so far may well be his lesser-known 2004 solo record, “The Slow Wonder.” Featuring supremely catchy indie-pop stomps alongside more introspective tracks, it proved that Newman could write personal and meaningful music that didn’t simply fulfill the power-pop template so successfully adopted by The New Pornographers. The triumph of “The Slow Wonder,” then, could only arouse high hopes for Newman’s latest release, his second solo album, “Get Guilty.”“Get Guilty,” though, is nothing like “The Slow Wonder.” Whereas the latter was a boldly experimental album that saw Newman embracing diverse instruments and song forms, the former is consistent from start to finish, seldom, if ever, breaking out of its comfort zone. In fact, “Get Guilty” is much more reminiscent of The New Pornographers’ most recent album, “Challengers.” That album’s power-pop feel (think “Pet Sounds” via Big Star) is continued on most of the new LP’s tracks, as is the focus on romantic themes. “The Heartbreak Rides,” easily the best track on “Get Guilty,” could have been taken straight off of “Challengers.” The intricate melody is divine and the lyrics contain the stream of consciousness imagery that anyone familiar with Newman’s oeuvre will expect – “Pushing at the modern sunset to your window / Gestured with the plain-Jane hand, she said, ‘Let’s go.’” It’s a brilliant song and serves as a reminder of just how good Newman is at his job.Frustratingly, not all of “Get Guilty” lives up to this high standard. Many tracks rely on the stop-start rhythms that characterized much of “Challengers,” making that album the least-loved of the New Pornographers’ output. “Thunderbolts” is a particularly disappointing example. The song provides none of the hooks Newman is known for, instead serving up a drone of piano chords and a phoned-in vocal performance. “Prophets” also goes nowhere, occasionally threatening to burst out into a glorious melody but instead settling for a chorus that is neither coherent nor interesting.These tracks and others suffer from the album’s extremely poor production. Almost every song sounds flat, with the drumming particularly marginalized. Only “The Heartbreak Rides” offers any kind of percussive propulsion, another reason why that song stands so far above the mediocrity of the other tracks.Despite these weaknesses, there are still some delights to be had on “Get Guilty.” Stately opener “There Are Maybe Ten or Twelve” is a classic Newman song, featuring lyrics that outline the intriguing ambiguity of much of his work – “There are maybe ten or twelve things I could teach you / After that, well, you’re on your own.” Closer “All of My Days and All of My Days Off” is beautifully direct and manages to remain effective despite the enormous amount of times Newman sings the song’s title. These highlights are best enjoyed on their own, though, as they tend to merge together with the weaker songs when not culled from the lot.“Get Guilty” is not a bad album and might have been seen as a success for a lesser talent. Coming from as accomplished an artist as Newman, however, it can only be seen as a disappointment. “The Slow Wonder” suggested that Newman recognized no boundaries to his songwriting, but five years later he seems happy to constrain himself to the narrow territory he has already laid out.  Hopefully when The New Pornographers reconvene to record their fifth album Newman will decide to once again take a few risks. Given his talent, it’s pretty much a certainty that Newman could pull them off.—Staff writer Chris R. Kingston can be reached kingston@fas.harvard.edu.

For nearly a decade, Animal Collective have built a myth from music that thwarts both a satisfactory musical genealogy and a single sufficient expression of genre. Even as that myth flirted with self-parody—with the insistence on foregoing members’ names for precocious pseudonyms or wearing ridiculous masks in press photos—the band’s approach to music-making has remained consistently innovative and their output stubbornly unique.For six years and as many albums, Animal Collective narrated a sort of ongoing insane, half-perfect sonic collage of genre, building structurally damaged and occasionally brilliant pop songs out of hastily-rendered foundations of rock, folk, trance and psychedelic music. Oscillating between the creative controls of the respective halves of its founding duo, David “Avey Tare” Portner and Noah “Panda Bear” Lennox, the band matured from a cabal of electronic-noise anarchists into fully-fledged experimental-pop pioneers. The subject matter of their songs tended usually (and, in light of lyrical choice, thankfully) toward the uncertain, but generally shared a thematic convergence of childlike awe, exuberance, and ecstatic joy propelled by a fascination with dynamic tension that can only rightly be called explosive.Then in 2007, the nascent cult around the band grew exponentially—and rightly so—for two reasons. The first came in March, when Lennox released his third solo album, the sublime, sample-bending “Person Pitch,” to widespread critical acclaim. The second came in December, when the band proper released their seventh album, “Strawberry Jam.” Delivering on the promise of their finest early work—2003’s “Here Comes the Indian” and 2004’s “Sung Tongs” in particular—“Strawberry Jam” was a masterpiece whose dense soundscapes alternately grinned and strained with near-violent anxiety. To date, that album is Animal Collective’s zenith.The band’s seventh album, “Merriweather Post Pavilion,” finds the quartet—temporarily reduced to a trio due to guitarist Josh “Deakin” Dibb’s hiatus—at the high water mark of their popularity, exploring a creative future that looks beyond the end that “Strawberry Jam” seemed to suggest. The album’s defining force, its sonic texture, constitutes a synthesis of the central engines behind its direct predecessors—of the hypnotic groove-generator underscoring much of “Person Pitch” and the manic glee that brought “Strawberry Jam” to life. The result is nothing short of a totally fulfilling, happily singular statement in their already impressive decade of work.Like every other one of their creations, “Merriweather Post Pavilion” bucks any easy definition. To be sure, it’s Animal Collective’s most accessible record, but it only invites access on the band’s preconditions—the music never aspires to anything so much as it expects listeners to aspire to the music. Submerged in a seamless ocean of arpeggiated electronic sound, the album affects a reoccurring cycle of freak-pop whose contours range from low-end love songs to psychedelic-dance.The album’s ambitious opener sets the tone. “In The Flowers” seems to emerge from outer space, with Portner’s vocals fading in and out over various layers of keyboard sound, before blossoming all at once into a percussive, anthemic epiphany. Portner’s vocal harmonies with Lennox have never sounded better, while the former’s impressive range has always been the signature of the band, the latter’s sheer beauty brings frequent comparisons to the Beach Boys in their heyday. And while both voices have always been put to more instrumental use than is typical in pop music, here they have the trappings of true polish.“My Girls,” the album’s most obvious single, builds toward a sugary, handclap-heavy, altogether nonsensical chorus. Like the tracks that follow, it’s stacked high and deep with keyboard loops, distorted vocal samples, and percussion both various and eclectic. Calling it this year’s “Paper Planes” may be premature, but equipped with a song like this, Animal Collective are well armed for crossover success.Yet another song of this cloth, “Summertime Clothes,” opens with a fierce, bass-heavy synthesizer and kick-drum reminiscent of the previous album’s triumphant “For Reverend Green,” but quickly eschews that juggernaut’s bipolar conceit in search of sunny pop-hooks.Maybe it’s this sort of decision that makes “Merriweather Post Pavilion” pale slightly next to “Strawberry Jam.” While that album crystallized the psychological depths of Animal Collective’s music—however inscrutable and contradictory those depths may be—many of the album’s brightest moments still feel relatively sterile compared to the implicit emotional turmoil that yielded fractured perfection like “Peacebone” and “Cuckoo Cuckoo.”This also may be why the album’s best songs are the ones that deviate from this pattern. “Bluish,” a wash of innocent echo-chamber balladry, would disappear into the labyrinth of its swirling accompaniment if not for the sheer fact that it’s the album’s most beautiful adornment. Similarly, the relatively spare “No More Runnin” is a drawn-out, dreamy moment of calm on the album’s B-side, whose progression of successively hyperactive dance tracks terminates in the closer, “Brother Sport.”Debuted on the band’s last tour in long form, “Brother Sport,” a distinctively Lennox-penned track, simultaneously encapsulates the music that comes before it and renders it obsolete. In lieu of verses, the song builds up momentum through three separate sections, each with its own chorus, that shift into one another and arrive, from initial reverie, upon jubilant catharsis. At six minutes, it’s barely long enough.As has become customary, new songs from the band are already appearing in their ensuing tour. This material seems to indicate a more settled, atmospherically uniform sound than ever before, but as outtakes from “Strawberry Jam,” like “Safer” and “Water Curses,” failed to predict the shift toward “Merriweather Post Pavilion,” it’s understood that Animal Collective are nothing if not unpredictable. For the moment, this piece appears to complete the triptych that began with “Person Pitch,” but the eternal question of what they will do next has become as much a part of the fabric of the band as the music itself.—Staff writer Ryan J. Meehan can be reached rmeehan@fas.harvard.edu.

After four years, Franz Ferdinand’s finally returned to the party. “Tonight: Franz Ferdinand,” their third album, finds the Scottish foursome still making dance floor-worthy post-punk. Their latest effort expands their signature style by adding more synthesizers and cranking up the bass in an attempt to satisfy the absurdly high expectations that grew over their long hiatus.  However, while “Tonight” is a solid album, it is not as mind-blowingly awesome as it should be.The album’s best tracks showcase Franz Ferdinand doing what they do best: beat-driven, catchy, darkly sly dance tunes. Lyrics from Ulysses (“So sinister, so sinister last night was wild / What’s a matter there, feeling kinda anxious?”) are a bit unnerving, demonstrating, as always, the darkness that can come with having a good time.This time around, they mixed up the formula, adding more synth and dub influences. They have dabbled with synth before, but every song on this album, save one, heavily incorporates a synthesizer and electronic elements. “Ulysses” and “No You Girls” manage to stay true to the old Franz Ferdinand aesthetic while adding these newer elements. That said, they fail to replicate the magic of their most popular single, “Take Me Out.”The album goes wrong when they depart almost completely from their template, evident in “Lucid Dreams.” The song clocks in at nearly 8 minutes and much of that is a dub odyssey with a lazy, reggae-influenced beat. The album’s version of “Lucid Dreams” is not to be confused with a different song released earlier this fall and found on the band’s website. The older version was  a fun and catchy dance tune and could have been a second “This Fire,” if not “Take Me Out.” However, the album version veers too far into experimental, uncharted territory for Franz Ferdinand. Instead of the straightforward dance-rock, they substitute the catchy choruses for musing, fuzzy electro-noodlings.  The first half of the album is much better than the second. The second half’s main problem lies in some of the songs’ repetitiveness and slow pace. One would wish the band had been able to come up with tunes worth humming. The chilled out ending of“Lucid Dreams” slows the album down; it never recovers. The next song, “Dream Again,” is even slower, melodically unremarkable, and serves only as a transition to “Katherine Kiss Me.” The only acoustic song on the entire album, “Katherine Kiss Me,” emphasizes Kapranos’s voice by putting it up front in the mix. The melody is sweet but out of place with the rest of the album’s dance-punk aesthetic.“Tonight” grows on you. For the most part, it’s fun to groove to. But, after spending four years minimally updating their sound, “Tonight: Franz Ferdinand” is inarguably a disappointment. —Staff writer Candace I. Munroe can be reached at cimunroe@fas.harvard.edu.

Driving around Los Angeles on a peaceful, neon-lit night, Bow Wow and JD reflect on their past quarrels and present admiration. See, back when Bow Wow was still Lil’, he swore never to talk to his once-mentor after being scolded for taking too long in the shower at their crib. Bow Wow moved out to live with his bud Lil’ Romeo, and Dupri spent the next few years concentrating on growing his beard. But in this new age of hope and change, the two swore to uphold the creed of “Obama, no drama.” So they kissed and made up, announcing their revitalized bromance on the cover of The Source.Now, driving their snail-paced Chevy back from a taping of Best Friend’s Week on “Wheel of Fortune”—Dupri drives, since Bow Wow still doesn’t have his permit—the two “true friends” proclaim their multi-faceted similarities. “We walk just alike, talk just alike,” they observe, and even have “the same damn swagger when we rock up on the mic.” Bow Wow, however, seems a little unfocused on this lovefest as fantasies of blue-tinted women run through his head. And where is your seatbelt, young man?You can almost see a few tears well up in Dupri’s eyes as he praises Bow Wow, who’s “more like a son that just a little brother” to him. “You never know what you got ’til it’s gone,” Dupri says, remembering the late nights he and Bow Wow spent drinking hot cocoa and listening to Joni Mitchell. Swelling with gratitude, Bow Wow recounts his favorite memory: fulfilling his promise to “smash all dem women” when he gets older. “And I did it!” he yells, overcome with nostalgic pride. Ah, the awesome power of friendship.—Jeff W. Feldman

I’ve been playing a lot of “Rock Band” lately, and without a doubt, the dumbest part of that video game is the character customization, which allows me to buy new accessories and haircuts for my onscreen persona and completely change its appearance. But the last thing I care about when I’m slack-jawed and repetitively strumming my fake plastic guitar is the outfit my stupid pixellated avatar is wearing while spasmodically strumming his fake virtual guitar. I also care very little about aptly named Hoobastank; no surprise, then, that in the video for their new single “My Turn,” the band members seize upon a video game motif to play dress-up to no end.The video has Hoobastank and their gear sitting atop what appears to be a giant spinning hockey puck, because, with the current state of the NHL, pucks gotta take work where they can get it. Meanwhile, blindingly painful imagery—probably lifted from the iTunes visualizer—provides a psychedelic backdrop. Band members teleport in and out, occasionally popping back into view wearing superhero outfits and other goofy costumes. Silly hats abound (sombreros!). Sometimes band members’ instruments and places are usurped by football players, or hot chicks (strippers!), or uniformed police officers. This never results in any drop-off in musical quality.Hoobastank have copped in interviews to their middle-of-the-road reputation, and this song’s largely more (MoR) of the same. Lead singer Doug Robb—or is it Robb Doug?—keeps asking “When’s it gonna be my turn?” like he’s trying to get in on his own game of “Rock Band.” He’d probably find it more involving, as Hoobastank’s paint-by-number pop-rock suggests a level of musical sophistication that could easily be attained playing several hours of video games. But when the video ends and the screen flashes, “It’s your turn,” I’m more than willing to pass. Game over, man. Game over.—Jake G. Cohen

If you tell someone who lives in Aspen that you spent five days skiing and watching sixteen films, they might suspect that you spent the week on a cocaine binge with the ghost of Hunter S. Thompson. If you tell the same story in Park City, Utah, though, even your cab driver will give you a knowing smile that says, “Your first Sundance Festival, eh?”After many years of waiting, prowling the “Sundance” section at Blockbuster, and watching channel 117 (Sundance Channel), I finally made the pilgrimage to Robert Redford’s mecca of film and celebrity this January. Despite the all-star journalists at the country’s top newspapers, magazines, and blogs that criticize Sundance’s growing commercial and mainstream vibe, I think I found the true spirit of the festival. It just resided in the least likely places.
The moment I got off the plane in Salt Lake City, I already knew that I was in a strange place. Young men and women were walking around in suits with name tags, heading out to begin their two years of mission work. The driver from Salt Lake to Park City explained the whole story of the Mormons to me—from Joseph Smith to the point in the 1970s when Latter Day Saint clerics announced that miraculously the Mormon church was no longer just for white people. I soon found that the most common defense of character in Utah is, “I’m not Mormon.” The driver was Italian, he said.
Once the car pulled into aesthetically grungy Park City though, the world of “Big Love” polygamy and temperance was quickly replaced with a veritable terrarium of the entertainment industry. Lay people and stargazers alike slipped down icy Main Street looking through windows where cozy, rising and falling stars sipped spiked coffee in corporate sponsored parties and gifting suites.
In its 25th year of existence, the festival itself is still fairly straightforward. A series of theatres spread across the Salt Lake City area­—though primarily in Park City—each show between four and five independent films (features, documentaries, and shorts) each day over a two-week period. I was only there for the second week of the festival and primarily saw feature films from the Premiere, U. S. Dramatic, and World Dramatic categories. 
Every kind of film critic was represented: the loves-it-all USA Today type, the can’t-stand-anything-but-artsy New York Times type, the bitter-because-I’d-rather-be-writing-scripts L.A. Times type, and everything in between. Those endowed with press or corporate passes blew by the long lines that grouped outside the theaters, but for once, nobody seemed to mind. Despite the wintry weather, the cinematic discourse continued on between strangers and new acquaintances unabated.
Even with the diversity of the audience, the highlight of the festival is still very much the films (“Not movies!” as someone screamed to a woman on the shuttle one day). The first and probably most poignant one I saw was “Bronson,” which stylistically told the true story of England’s “most violent criminal.” The performance was a tour de force by lead Tom Hardy, and the combination of his intense acting with a loud soundtrack of Wagner and Pet Shop Boys created a “Clockwork Orange”—on a particularly violent day—ambience. 
Other notables included John Krasinski’s (“The Office”) adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s “Brief Interviews With Hideous Men,” entitled “Sin Nombre.” Krasinski directed and stars in the film, which follows an ex-gang member as he tries to escape Central America into the U.S. 
[CORRECTION APPENDED]“In the Loop” and “I Love You Phillip Morris” were also remarkable in their own right. “In the Loop” is a hysterical British comedy that follows English and American bureaucrats as they stumble clumsily into the Iraq War. Like a wry, comedic version of “The Ugly American,” its side-splitting humor is tinged throughout by the debacle of the current situation in the Middle East. 
“I Love You Phillip Morris,” starring Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor, is a composite of “Catch Me If You Can” and “Brokeback Mountain.” Carrey’s character is imprisoned for white-collar crimes, and there he falls in love with fellow inmate Phillip Morris (McGregor). The film is all at once extremely funny, sad, and beautiful, and if it hasn’t already been bought, then it soon will.
Despite the abundantly obvious corporate presence and mainstream feel, there is still an organic quality to Sundance that makes going to the festival an otherworldly experience. Where else can you sit in a full theatre of enthusiastic moviegoers hanging every moment like it was their last hour with a lover? Where else can you watch actor Lou Pucci in three films in one day and sit next to him in another movie the next?
The diva journalists who complain about and run from the Sundance of today are also the ones that blow past the commoners waiting in line. They get invites to corporate parties and play dress up with celebrities. To them, Sundance is a circus, but to those who can’t afford the circus, it’s a dream come true.
I knew I was at the Sundance of lore when the Filipino man renting my hotel manager’s basement drove me the hour to Sundance Resort one day because no other option was remotely affordable. I knew I was at Sundance when the busboy, who didn’t speak much English asked if I liked “The Informers”—because he did.
After the circus moves on back to L.A. and New York, the locals of Park City, on whose backs the festival rests, come together to watch the “Best of Fest” at several Sundance venues. I was lucky enough to get tickets to the Audience Award Winner for Documentary, “The Cove,” which focused on the annual slaughter of dolphins in Japan. It was one of the most moving films I had ever seen in my life and was so intense it played more like an action movie than a documentary. It was the first and only movie I saw that got a standing ovation at the end—1,200 people, many of them residents, cheering, crying, and appreciating the film in a uniquely touching way.
I looked down the aisle from where I was, and a blind woman was standing, clutching her seeing eye dog’s leash in one hand and letting out a loud whoop. While the entertainment industry and media complained of recession and commercialization, Sundance was still bright and glinting in the eyes of those with an undying love for film.
—Columnist Andrew F. Nunnelly can be reached at nunnelly@fas.harvard.edu.CORRECTION: The Feb. 6 article "Finding Fun in the Sun(dance)" incorrectly stated that the movies "Brief Interviews With Hideous Men" and "Sin Nombre" were one and the same. In fact, the two are distinct films, both shown at Sundance. The former was by director and screenwriter John Krasinski and the latter by director and screenwriter Cary Joji Fukunaga.

Stripped of his tuxedo, Aston Martin, and martini, the newest James Bond still maintains an heroic persona in his latest film, “Defiance.” While the movie’s Holocaust setting might arouse the expectation of another horrifying display of Nazi actions (as in “Schindler’s List), director Edward Zwick ’74 (“The Last Samurai,” “Blood Diamond”) surprises the audience by examining the Holocaust from an original angle. In a story of survival, Daniel Craig (“Casino Royale”), as Tuvia Bielski, becomes a symbol of hope as he leads a large community of Jewish refugees hiding in the forests of Belarus. Based on a true story, “Defiance” narrates Tuvia’s journey as he and his followers attempt to rebuild a life that was stolen from them. Having fled into the forest after the death of their parents, the four Bielski brothers discover that they share their refuge with many other Jews from the surrounding towns. Tuvia refuses to leave a single man, woman, or child helpless in the forest, causing their community of survivors to grow. The Bielski brothers—soon called “The Bielski Otriad” by their companions—are burdened with the responsibility of sheltering, feeding, and protecting all of the people. Zus and Tuvia struggle with a troubling paradox: Is killing inherently a part of surviving? Should they kill at all? To what end? Liev Schreiber’s performance as the revenge-obsessed Zus is a compelling portrayal of a man unable to let go of his desire to seek revenge on the Nazis, even when it is necessary for survival. When Zus’s thirst for bloody retribution clashes with Tuvia’s pragmatic restraint, the two brothers part ways—Zus to the Russian resistance and Tuvia to lead the forest community. Although Craig’s role in “Defiance” is a far cry from secret agent James Bond, his emotionally charged portrayal of Tuvia’s inner journey to become a cool-headed leader of the Jewish refugee camp is a well-executed and successful opposite for Zus.While the audience might anticipate scene-after-scene of imprisonment and execution, Zwick’s film opts out of presenting the bleak misery within the camps, instead exploring the emotional challenge for those outside of the concentration camps. Zwick nestles the Bielski Otriad in a beautiful forest—a place that is far from the war, with the potential for recreating lives. This uplifting environment creates a setting for possibility. It is a place where each and every person must work to regain what they once had; intellectuals, accountants, and upper-class snobs are remodeled as farmers, hunters, builders, and fighters. Surrendering to weakness—cold, starvation, or sickness—is simply not an option. The suffering and loss of the refugees are not necessarily poorly presented onscreen, but “Defiance” is ultimately the tale of the transformative effect of Tuvia Bielski’s hopeful ideals and undying strength. As such, the death and defeat of the Holocaust is overcome onscreen by Tuvia’s message of possibility and faith. Composers Joshua Bell and James Newton Howard weave a brooding tone into each scene. Though a surprising amount of humor is sprinkled throughout the film, the weeping violins speak to the constant melancholy of the woods, winter, and persecution. Even moments of happiness and hope, such as the wedding scene between Asael and his wife Chaya (Mia Wasikowska), are interspersed with scenes of Zus’s bloody work as a soldier and accented by the pain-filled whine of string instruments.To the Jews of the Bielski Otriad forest camp, living life is a sign of rebellion against the Nazis and a demonstration of their faith in the future. Despite the freezing winter and the loss of family members, Tuvia teaches the refugees, and the audience, that all hardships can produce great accomplishments, and through the Bielski brothers, Zwick acknowledges the importance of living—not merely surviving, but thriving.—Staff writer Noël D.

At the end of “Notorious,” Voletta Wallace comes to grips with the death of her son, Christopher. “I find solace in knowing that he became a man and he was ready to live,” she says in a voiceover. The narration puns on the name of the debut album that Christopher—better known as The Notorious B.I.G.—recorded in 1994, entitled “Ready to Die.” The LP awakened East Coast rap from a protracted hibernation and established one of the genre’s most vital lyricists. Yet “Notorious,” the glossy new biopic of Biggie Smalls, paints Wallace’s transformation into a man in only the broadest, brightest strokes. For a movie trying to revive interest in one of rap’s most storied and complicated figures—a movie trying to give Biggie life after death—“Notorious” is rather lifeless. The toughest dilemma that biopics face is deciding where to crop the canvas of their subjects’ lives, and “Notorious” solves this problem by deciding not to crop at all. After opening with Wallace’s death, the film breezes through his childhood in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, his stint as a drug dealer, his meteoric rise to fame, and finally the East Coast-West Coast beef that ultimately cost him his life. Occasional narration from Biggie (Jamal Woolard) smooths over the narrative transitions, but Voletta Wallace (played by a surprisingly stilted Angela Bassett) awkwardly butts in as a second narrator to eulogize her son as the film closes on his triumphant funeral parade. The real Voletta Wallace helped produce the film, so it’s no surprise the movie strikes a hagiographic tone. Biggie either learns from misdeeds (neglecting his young daughter is bad!) or explains them away (dealing crack to a pregnant woman is just part of the game!). The movie lionizes Biggie as a mensch-in-the-making, yet it also bizarrely cites the opening lines to his track “Suicidal Thoughts.” “When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell,” he rapped, “’Cause I’m a piece of shit, it ain’t hard to fuckin’ tell.” Biggie himself would probably tell you that he wasn’t a great man so much as he was a great rapper. At least the filmmakers chose a rapper—if not a great one—to portray Wallace. Jamal Woolard, a.k.a. Gravy, brings weight to the role (he gained 100 pounds to equal the heft of 300-plus-pounder Biggie) if not always the proper gravitas. And while he may not have Wallace’s deep voice or charisma, he often nails the cadences of Biggie’s flow and delivers a convincing and emotionally candid performance.  “Notorious” spends a substantial slice of its running time as a romantic dramedy. After fathering a daughter with his high school girlfriend, Wallace had a lengthy relationship with fiery rapper Lil’ Kim (Naturi Naughton) and subsequently married agreeable R&B singer Faith Evans (Antonique Smith). Both actresses do a decent job of playing archetypal strong women, but the characters never evolve. Same goes for Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) as a jive-talking cipher and Sean Combs (Derek Luke), who isn’t puffy so much as a plain, humorless sidekick. George Tillman, Jr. directs “Notorious” like it’s a boilerplate rap music video: there’s technique and bling to burn, but the whole film is so literal, so resolutely un-fun. When Biggie enters the studio to record classic “Juicy” halfway through the film, it becomes painfully evident that the rapper could tell his own story in five minutes much better than any film can in two hours. The rags-to-riches story “Juicy” delivered was both affecting and genuine—and unlike “Notorious,” it expressed a heartfelt love for rap. “Notorious” clearly steals some shots from the video to “Juicy”—a Brooklyn stoop illuminated by streetlights, Biggie getting arrested on a street corner for peddling dope. In recent days, I’ve been re-watching the “Juicy” video a lot, trying to erase the taste “Notorious” left in my mouth, telling myself it was all a (bad) dream.  —Staff writer Jake G.

“It’s not necessarily the best film, but it’s the one that moves me most...It’s the only time a script came to me in a dream,” quipped writer-director Paul Schrader at a screening of his 1992 film “Light Sleeper” during last weekend’s three-day retrospective of Schrader’s life at the Harvard Film Archive (HFA). “I mean, a lot of scripts come to me in dreams. It’s the only time a good script came to me in a dream.”Such lighthearted banter is unexpected from a man who’s built a career writing gritty films like “Raging Bull” and directing urban classics like “American Gigolo.”  Schrader was present at two of the six HFA screenings and also reached out to students at Kirkland House and in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) during his time in Cambridge.As a student himself in the late sixties and early seventies, Schrader did not plan to become a director. He received a late introduction to the world of film, prevented by his strict Calvinist background from seeing a movie until the age of eighteen. He made up for lost time by watching an average of three movies a day while studying at UCLA and earning his MA in Film Studies. While viewing Robert Bresson’s “Pickpocket,” though,  Schrader became inspired by the film’s careful investigation of society, and his work veered from film criticism into screenwriting.“I got into writing for the best of all reasons: self-therapy,” Schrader says. “It was an artistic self-exorcism.” Now when teaching screenwriting classes, Schrader coaches his students in what he calls “the evolution from problems to metaphors to stories.”Often this problem is loneliness. Before writing “Taxi Driver,” the film that catapulted him to national acclaim, Schrader spent a stretch of time living in his car, eventually coming to the chilling realization that he hadn’t spoken to another human being in weeks.“I’m like a kid in this steel box, this steel coffin, surrounded by all these people but all alone,” he recalled. “If I didn’t start writing this, it would have started writing me.” When Schrader has derived a story from a given problem, he develops the plot by testing it on an audience. If the story can hold someone’s attention for forty-five minutes, he is confident he has a film. And as someone who grew up “listening to grown-ups telling stories” in lieu of television, he knows how to hold an audience. Even while fielding serious questions, he managed to draw laughter from the crowd.Schrader both wrote and directed “Light Sleeper” and “Blue Collar,” shown at the HFA on Saturday night. When asked about his transition to directing, he said that screenwriting was too intermediary. “I didn’t feel I was a writer,” he said. “I didn’t feel like I was an author, an artist. I felt like I was part of a process.” As a director, Schrader said he also realized that “a literary logic is different than a visual logic.” But regardless of which “logic” he is using, Schrader employs it to emphasize the characters in his films. Though his protagonists stem from similar problems, they vary widely in their realization. “I don’t believe that social ideology should determine your film,” Schrader said. “The ending should be determined by the spiritual integrity of your characters.” The full reign that Schrader gives his characters accounts for the differences in ideological philosophy that arise: in “Blue Collar,” the street-talking factory workers were read by audiences as spearheads for communism; in “Mishima,” the militaristic title character reaches a violent end in part due to his right-wing politics. This “spiritual integrity,” however, doesn’t mean the characters are always completely honest. “I love the unreliable narrator,” Schrader says.Though Schrader said he rarely watches his work after it is released, he retains an impression of each of his films, reflecting the initial emotional stimulus behind the film’s conception. “Certain things stay with me,” he said, referring to “Light Sleeper,” in particular. “And I remember the yearning, and how much I loved the yearning.”—Staff writer Rebecca A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those of us just exiting our teen years and entering our twenties, Ladysmith Black Mambazo is an inextricable part of our childhoods­—whether you know who they are or not. How many of us are unable to recall the rough velvet vocals of the “Life...savers...Mmmmmmmmm” jingle, or the Serengeti-style rendition of Sesame Street’s Alphabet Song?Since 1987, when Paul Simon produced the group’s first American record, “Shaka Zulu,” Ladysmith Black Mambazo has been our country’s ambassador for African music. On February 7, they bring their unmistakable sound to Sanders Theatre, returning for the fourth time in as many years.Before Simon brought Ladysmith to the world’s attention, the group had been singing together for some 26 years under the leadership of founder Joseph Shabalala. Shabalala, a farmer and factory worker, named the group in part after his hometown of Ladysmith, South Africa. The group’s name reflects Shabalala’s heritage: “Black” stands for the most powerful animal on an African farm, the black ox, and “Mambazo” is the Zulu word for “axe.”Shabalala left the town of Ladysmith for the city of Durbin in 1959 because he wanted to make music that fused the traditions of his hometown with a modern, national sound. “I have a sound,” Shabalala says. “I have a dream. I have something that we can do better.”Albert Mazibuko, the group’s current spokesman, joined Ladysmith Black Mambazo during a time of transition. According to Mazibuko, Shabalala had dissolved his previous group shortly before approaching Mazibuko, his cousin. Almost 50 years later, Shabalala still leads the group, which now includes Mazibuko and four of Shabalala’s sons.The importance of family has always been a part of Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s essential image, which famously projects a message of cooperation and understanding.“It’s a message of love,” Mazibuko says. “It’s a message of peace. It’s a message of encouraging people to speak together and work together and share ideas, work together young and old.”Not only did this ideal make Ladysmith a natural match for Paul Simon and Sesame Street, it also enabled them to spread their message of understanding into the political realm as cultural ambassadors. Anti-apartheid activists in South Africa and abroad took Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s music as an unofficial anthem. In 1994, the group performed at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela, the first black president of South Africa.Shabalala and company have hardly slowed down since, producing a steady stream of recordings and maintaining an energetic touring schedule.“Every time when we perform, we feel that people never get enough of us,” Mazibuko says. “So now we decided to make a DVD with the live performance, so that they can be able to take us out when they are home and relaxing, and learn more about group. In interviews we talk about [our]  lives, how we became involved, what the music does to us, all those things.”Mazibuko says the group is excited to be returning to Harvard, having sold out Sanders Theatre just last January. They will be performing the show as recorded on their DVD, titled “Ladysmith Black Mambazo Live!” It includes old favorites like “Nomathemba,” one of the first songs Joseph Shabalala wrote for the group, as well as others like “Ekuhlupekeni,” all of which reflect the group’s gospel ideals.Unfortunately, the Alphabet Song and the Lifesavers jingle are not included in their concert repertoire. Ladysmith Black Mambazo will, however, be inviting audience members to sing and dance along with them. It’s all a part of their time-tested tradition of unity and cooperation.“The message goes with the times,” Mazibuko says. “The message is strong and in harmony. Joseph makes sure everything is together, so we don’t want to change that.”—Staff Writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.

The “Students Choose” exhibit might have looked unwelcoming, tucked away in the Sert Gallery in the Carpenter Center. But this Visual and Environmental Studies exhibit was just the way to remind Harvard students of the power art can have and its sophisticated way of providing both artists and viewers an alternative way to explore and express.The first segment of the two-part exhibit ran from January 20-30—the second part is currently on exhibition through February 13—and featured the work of 13 student artists from various fall semester VES studio classes. Each class voted on the piece of work they would like to exhibit. Some artists whose work was on display, however, did not even know they had been chosen to participate. The art gave a broad sampling of what goes on in the world of VES—often secluded from more traditional concentrations—with pieces in a range of media, including sculpture, photography, oil paintings, silk screening, music, and video. The exhibit as a whole provides visitors with a new sort of intellectual engagement distinct from lectures and paper writing, asking students to think beyond their concentration or what they’ve come to regard as the norm at Harvard.Upon opening the heavy door to the Sert Gallery, viewers could stare into the face of Dorothy L. McLeod ’12, standing in her dorm room with a shadow on her face. The photograph entitled “The Skies are Different Here,” by Alissa C. Costello ’12, was part of a larger, semester-long project of creating portraits of about 40 different freshmen. The project became Costello’s way of exploring the freshmen transition and their struggle to combine Harvard’s expectations with their own. “I’m trying to reveal the limbo, the in-between period,” Costello said. “It’s such a profound time of transformation. The nuances of the shift for each individual each had their own way of falling onto the film.”While Costello documented students’ discoveries of what it means to be a Harvard student, Isidore M. T. Bethel ’11 applied a standard Harvard skill, a knack for analyzing novels and film, to his video installation piece. The piece features three television screens, each with different repeating loops of film. The subjects, Mary C. Potter ’11 and her father Tom Potter, were first videotaped unscripted, in their normal environment. Their dialogue was then rearranged by Bethel to create a new story. “By reflecting unrehearsed, nonfictional parts of these two people’s lives in fictionalized written and videotaped media,” Bethel said, “the fabric of their reality became something fictive, subject to the rules of analysis we apply to a novel or a film.”Further into the gallery, faint whiffs of apple emanated from a crate filled with decaying red apples punctured with nails. Xinran Yuan ’10, also a Crimson photo editor, calls her sculpture from her VES 30 class the more literal interpretation of peer pressure and self-realization. “I was dealing with evoking awareness of the space within people, this idea of inner space and searching for the traces of oneself,” Yuan said. “Eventually the whole piece is meant to decay.”Kayla A. Escobedo ’12 continued the theme of personal development, using her oil painting as a way to acknowledge and commemorate her growth in her relationship with her father. The painting depicts her mother and father as collections of hands. Her mother’s hands reach outwards and her father’s hands inwards.“I wanted to honor and respect my dad now that I’m finally getting to know him,” Escobedo said. “But I didn’t just want to paint him the way he looked. Our hands convey our personalities.” A song created by Michael C. Soto ’09 as part of his piece provides background for the whole exhibit. His exhibits features his song, a mosaic of 16 silk-screens, and a rhythm machine with corresponding buttons featuring samples of music by the subjects in his silkscreens, such as Sufjan Stevens and Bill Collins. Soto has always been enthralled by hip-hop music and the hip-hop community. Silkscreening, however, was Soto’s first venture into the VES department.“There seems to be a disconnect between VES, other concentrations, and the way people think about art classes in general.” said Soto. “Harvard definitely has a culture of not taking it seriously and not really understanding what’s going on over in VES.”Some students would have preferred a more comprehensive exhibit. Many of the pieces on display were only parts of larger bodies of work, and only a miniscule sampling of the wealth of creative talent at Harvard.“There were 11 people in my class. We’re all students. None of us are ‘artists.’ We’re all still students,” Escobedo said. “While I am completely honored to be chosen, all students should get a chance to display their work. Everyone has beautiful and substantial works that no one knows about.”—Staff Writer Erika P. Pierson can be reached at epierson@fas.harvard.edu.

Massachusetts General Hospital received its largest donation in history yesterday—$100 million—to create a joint institute between Harvard, MIT, and affiliated hospitals with the stated goal of finding a vaccine for AIDS within the next decade.The gift from Phillip “Terry” Ragon and his wife, Susan, will create the Ragon Institute—designed to overhaul norms of clinical research by drawing from acclaimed physicians, researchers, and engineers in various fields who have never directly worked in AIDS research before.Harvard Medical School professor Bruce D. Walker,  who runs an AIDS clinic in South Africa, will serve as the Institute’s first director.“I was the one who met with Terry and engaged him in a conversation about how transforming a gift like this could be,” Walker said. “I told him about this pie in the sky idea to get a bunch of flexible funding and get really smart people together to think outside the box.”Walker approached Ragon—who had business of his own in South Africa—a year and a half ago regarding funding for AIDS research, and two weeks later, the two were on a plane together to see Walker’s clinic. Walker said Ragon had a transforming experience there and saw that the best means of combatting the problem was by investing in science.  “Research is where the leverage is,” Ragon said. “It’s the fulcrum you use if you want to move the world.”Ragon soon funded Walker’s project in South Africa, and the two continued to discuss how to fund research for a vaccine on a larger, more innovative scale.  An MIT graduate who founded InterSystems Corporation—a Cambridge-based software company—Ragon said the donation was designed to combat the lack of collaboration in research. “What’s really been lacking in biomedical research in general and HIV specifically is a lack of an interdisciplinary approach,” Ragon said.  “Everything is done in small isolated labs that don’t communicate.”Walker attacked this problem using what he called “door-to-door salesmanship” to recruit a wide range of local talent. He sat down with engineers and scientists in other fields—ranging from basic immunology to chemical engineering—and explained that if they were willing to refocus their efforts on AIDS research, he had the funding to cover it.“These are people that made their reputations in other fields,” Walker said.  “That kind of new perspective is what we’re really counting on.”Arup K. Chakraborty, head of the Chemical Engineering department at MIT, was another of the many local scientists tapped by Walker to join the institute, even though he had no direct experience with AIDS research.“I thought a lot of smart people had thought about this question and I wasn’t sure if I would bring something valuable to this effort,” he said.  But after visiting Walker’s clinic in South Africa, Chakraborty became convinced that he could offer his expertise to the issue.“Since then, after many scientific conversations, I have gotten very excited about puzzles I might be able to contribute to,” he said.An initial area of focus for vaccine development will be a small pool of HIV-infected patients whose bodies can somehow control replication of the virus.The announcement of the gift—which included a statement by University President Drew G. Faust—took place at a gathering of a couple hundred people yesterday at Harvard Square’s Charles Hotel. “[The Institute] will accelerate the discovery process, and it will reduce the time it takes to get those discoveries to the people whose lives they can save,” Faust said, according to a transcript of her remarks. “Terry and Susan have shown a level of understanding—and even daring—that is too rare in the world of philanthropy.”—Staff writer Laura G.

Harvard’s ongoing uncertainty about the pace of its Allston expansion—specifically the future of the much-anticipated science complex—was met by community frustration at last night’s Allston-Brighton neighborhood task force meeting.Residents demanded that Harvard follow through on its promise of community benefits and implement them quickly, regardless of possible changes to the Institutional Master Plan that lays out the University’s proposals for expansion. Chief University Planner Kathy A. Spiegelman said that the troubled economic climate is forcing the University to analyze all capital projects, and that it is unlikely that the University will file an updated IMP as planned in early 2009.Harvard broke ground on the science complex—its only Allston expansion initiative approved thus far—in 2008, following a cooperation agreement with the City of Boston to provide $25 million in community benefits. But the University is now considering alternate locations to house its stem cell research department, previously touted as a cornerstone of this new science center.The possibility that the building of the science complex may slow—or even halt entirely—has worried community members, who have complained about the aesthetic repercussions of Harvard’s construction delays.“I don’t want to be looking at a big hole,” said Cathleen Campbell, a member of the community task force. “I want to know that Harvard is 100 percent committed to completing [the science complex] and the community benefits associated with it.”But according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), Harvard cannot unilaterally decide to modify the pace of the science complex construction. “Even if Harvard chooses not to invest further money in constructing the project, they cannot do it without negotiating with the city,” said Kairos Shen, Boston’s chief planner. Shen added that because Harvard has not yet notified the BRA of any changes to its plan, the city has not considered the issue of the hole.  BRA Senior Project Manager Gerald Autler noted that “Harvard’s decision to stop construction on the building doesn’t necessarily release them on the cooperation agreements tied to the building.”However, the possibility of Harvard reneging on its promises still drew worry from residents. State representative Michael J. Moran said that the community accelerated approval for the science complex specifically because the planned research was “important to the bigger picture of health all over the world” and that halting construction “would be a serious step back in the relationship you’ve built with all of us.”City Councillor Mark Ciommo similarly argued that with “all the bright minds” at Harvard, it would be irresponsible to abandon construction of the science complex. “There’s too many vacant properties in this community as it is,” Ciommo said, noting that Harvard recently purchased land in Brighton without explicitly outlining plans for the property. Spiegelman responded that the University’s continued acquisitions are a signal of continued commitment to Allston. According to Spiegelman, talk of keeping the stem cell department in Cambridge partially reflects Harvard’s efforts to reassure its top faculty that despite financial trouble, scientific research remains a priority.A couple of task force members saw the University’s financial straits as an opportunity to define the community’s goals more clearly. “Just because Harvard is delayed doesn’t mean we need to be delayed,” said Bruce Houghton, a community task force member. “We need a plan so that the BRA and Harvard don’t shove us to one side.”But he also expressed doubts that Harvard’s financial situation truly rendered it incapable of following through on its promises in Allston. “The community should not accept that all things slow down,” Houghton said. “You have the resources, you have the ability, and we would like you to improve the community now.”—Staff writer Vidya B.

Golden Globe-winning actor James Franco will receive the Hasty Pudding Theatrical’s 2009 Man of the Year award next Friday, the group announced earlier today.Franco is perhaps best know for his roles as Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man trilogy and actor James Dean in the biographical TNT movie, which earned him the 2001 Golden Globe for Best Actor in a miniseries or television film.The 30-year-old California native also appeared in the 90s television series “Freaks and Geeks” and the films “Pineapple Express” and “Tristan & Isolde.” He can currently be seen in the biopic “Milk” along with Sean Penn.“We thought he was really relevant to us as students—he’s one of the few people in Hollywood who hasn’t sacrificed his education for his career,” said Hasty Pudding Theatricals Press and Publicity Manager Talisa B. Friedman ’10. Franco graduated from UCLA this spring with a degree in English and is currently working toward an MFA at Columbia University. Hasty Pudding producers Pierce E. Tria ’10 and Charlotte E. Twaalfhoven ’10 will roast Franco at New College Theatre Friday evening before presenting the actor with the traditional “Pudding Pot.”Friedman said she expected the roast to be “younger, maybe raunchier” than last year’s, when the group honored Christopher Walken.“He’s a lot closer to our age than Christopher Walken was,” she said.Following the ceremony, the Hasty Pudding will debut its 161th production, “Acropolis Now.”Earlier in the day, Franco will take a tour of Harvard and meet with Hasty Pudding company members, Freidman said. After the show, he will be invited to attend the Pudding’s after-party at the Hasty Pudding Social Club.The Man of the Year award was first presented in 1963, twelve years after the group established its Woman of the Year award. The Hasty Pudding will honor 2009 Woman of the Year Renee Zellweger in a celebration this afternoon. The festivities will commence with a parade down Mass. Ave., which will begin at the Inn at Harvard at 2:30 p.m. Following the parade, Hasty Pudding Theatricals President David J. Andersson ’09 and Vice President of the cast Thomas R. Compton ’09 will roast Zellweger at New College Theatre. The Hasty Pudding cast will end the ceremony with a preview of “Acropolis Now.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week before the 100th anniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, students from across the University gathered to re-charter the Harvard chapter of the historic organization last night.In front of nearly 75 attendees, HLS student James A. Nortey addressed the lack of social justice and civil rights initiatives on campus.“This is Harvard University. How can there not be an NAACP?” Nortey asked.The organization’s current on-campus absence may be part of a larger statewide trend. Once known for bitter anti-discrimination battles and struggles against segregated Boston public schools, the NAACP Boston chapter has become less vocal in recent years, according to the Boston Globe. Since the 1960s, the membership of the  Boston chapter has declined from nearly 5,000 to 400. At Harvard, the NAACP has followed a similar trajectory. Though a group of students founded a chapter in 1998, it soon became defunct due to a “lack of leadership,” according to Nortey.This time around, students are working to establish a more enduring presence at Harvard by enlisting talent from across the university. “We want to harness the skill sets of lawyers-to-be, doctors-to-be, policy-makers too-be, and businessmen-to-be,” Nortey said.Kennedy School student Desiree M. Cormier stressed the NAACP’s historic role as not only a vehicle for discussion, but also as a direct agent for action.  “We want to use the resources that we have from across the different graduate schools and college to benefit the surrounding communities in need,” Cormier said.Some initiatives include achieving greater diversity amongst university faculty, obtaining free diabetes screenings for the public, and engaging in active debate during the impending Criminal Record Offender Information reform.James Hoyte, Assistant to the University President, was present at the meeting in a demonstration of support for the Harvard chapter.Juan Cofield, president of the NAACP New England Area Conference, spoke about the need for youth participation and the cultivation of new leadership. Cofield noted the importance of attracting a diversity of membership as a means of reinvigorating the NAACP.“Colored people come in all colors,” Cofield said.  “Our arms are open, and we are inviting all people to participate and become involved.”—Staff writer Courtney P.

After 20 years at Harvard Medical School, Professor D. Gary Gilliland will depart to lead cancer research at the pharmaceutical giant, Merck & Co., the company announced earlier this week.While at Harvard, Gilliland gained international recognition for discovering the genetic basis of leukemia and served as director of both the Leukemia Program at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center and the Cancer Stem Cell Program for the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.Gilliland’s latest work harnessed his earlier findings to explore how drugs could be used to treat leukemia.“His expertise in both basic and translational research will enhance Merck’s efforts to develop innovative and individualized medicines to treat this devastating disease,” said Merck President Peter S. Kim in a statement.Colleagues praised Gilliland’s contributions to oncology at Harvard, and said yesterday that his leadership and mentorship would be missed.“He was very knowledgeable, a great collaborator, and a great friend, and hopefully still will be,” said Leonard I. Zon, an HMS hematologist and oncologist who collaborated with Gilliland through the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. David Scadden, the director of the Stem Cell Institute, yesterday praised Gilliland as “one of the leading lights in academic medicine.”“He made critical discoveries about the genetics of leukemia and changed the way we think about that disease,” Scadden wrote in an e-mailed statement. “But of equal importance, he has been an extraordinary mentor having fostered the careers of numerous future leaders in the field.”Scadden added that he was particularly saddened by Gilliland’s departure as the two had been planning adjacent laboratory space in Allston.“People are still dealing with the fact that he will not be there,” Zon said.  “Finding someone of his prestige will be a long process.”—Staff writer Laura G.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Ashton B. Carter may return to the Pentagon after nearly a decade in academia.Carter, the former assistant secretary of defense for international security policy under the Clinton administration, is expected to be named to the Pentagon’s top acquisition and technology job as early as this week, Reuters reports.The announcement would come as a flurry of Harvard professors—including many of Carter’s colleagues at the Kennedy School—prepare to head south for Washington to join the Obama administration.News of Carter’s likely appointment was met with approval at the Kennedy School, where many of his colleagues pointed to both his Pentagon experience and his academic credentials as key assets he will bring to the job.Former deputy secretary of defense John P. White—who is now a lecturer at the Kennedy School—met Carter during their White House years in the mid-1990s, and expressed his enthusiasm for the pick in an interview yesterday. White explained that the Department of Defense needs someone in the top acquisition post who not only understands how to drive the policies that guide the nation’s acquisition capabilities, but also possesses the “strong will” to make the necessary policy changes.“Ash can do that—no question about it,” White said, adding that Carter has “just the right skill set” and experience to rein in the over-budgeted programs.But White also acknowledged that Carter would face many challenges in this new position.“We have huge acquisition problems,” he said. “Almost all of our major weapons programs and related programs are overscheduled and over-budgeted.”During his time at the Pentagon under the Clinton administration, Carter was responsible for national security policy on arms control in the former Soviet Union and oversight of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and missile defense programs.Carter now co-directs the Preventive Defense Project—a collaborative research effort between Harvard and Stanford—with former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry.Former Dean of the Kennedy School Joseph S. Nye, who has been offered the position of U.S. ambassador to Japan, lauded the likely nomination as a “terrific choice.”Nye, who worked with Carter at the Pentagon during the Clinton administration, noted his unique background as an asset to the position—a physicist by training, Carter received a doctorate from Oxford University where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar.“We don’t often have a physicist who understands policy,” Nye said. “He’s a great scientist and policy maker.”—Staff writer June Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.

The rumor that alt-rock outfit Eve 6—known for singles “Inside Out” and “Here’s to the Night”—would be headlining at this year’s Yardfest sparked the ire of students as it circulated through House lists yesterday. 
The band’s MySpace page listed that they had a performance at Harvard University on April 19th, 4 p.m. with Sarah Bareilles, whose hits include “Love Song.”
In years past, Yardfest has been held on either the third or fourth weekend of April.
But according to members of the College Events Board—the student committee charged with planning the annual event—no definitive booking has been made, and no contract was ever signed.
“We did make some sort of contact with the band to see when they are available,” said Kevin M. Mee ’10, the CEB’s newly elected chairman. 
Mee added, however, that the CEB was not yet engaged “in any negotiations.”
“We definitely have not entered any contract agreements,” Mee said. “We’ll shoot to make final decision in the next month or so. We’re still considering lots of other options.”
Asked about the posting of Eve 6’s intended performance, Mee said, “I don’t know why that’s up there...that’s definitely inaccurate.”
Despite denials by CEB representatives over House lists, the outcry concerning Eve 6’s possible performance was not stifled. The protest was accompanied by criticism of the choices of past Yardfest artists Gavin DeGraw and Third Eye Blind, who students said were outdated.  
Formed by Max Collins, Jon Siebels, and Tony Fagenson in 1995, Eve 6 disbanded in 2004 after being dropped by their record label, RCA Corporation. The band’s latest tour, launched two years since their 2007 reunion, is scheduled to stop at several other schools in the region, including SUNY Binghamton and the University of Connecticut. 
The band’s representatives could not be reached for comment last night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Aiming to reduce costs in a bleak fiscal climate, Harvard has tightened faculty hiring in recent months—a move that has raised the question of whether certain peer universities are seizing the opportunity to acquire the best young talent.
Princeton and Yale—both of which have not instituted across-the-board cuts in faculty searches—are maintaining hiring levels, well aware of the increased scrutiny of faculty hiring at schools like Harvard, where, despite six new searches announced yesterday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has still seen its hiring slashed by half since this fall.
“Many of [our] peer institutions have decided that their strategy would be to take this as an opportunity to be aggressive and to invest in the future and in junior faculty,” said James H. Stock, chair of Harvard’s economics department. “I think that those are wise decisions.”
Stock has not been the only professor to acknowledge the prudence of meeting a slow economy with increased hiring efforts. At a meeting of the Faculty in mid-November, Xiao-Li Meng, the chair of the statistics department, was greeted with thunderous applause after standing to argue that Harvard could take advantage of the financial struggles of other universities by increasing its searches.
“The best asset about Harvard is not its endowment, but its faculty and students,” he said. “And I think this might be the best time for us to recruit.”
But in an interview last week, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith did not list faculty hiring among his top three priorities, preferring to stress a commitment to protecting and improving current academic programs.  
“Obviously, there are lots of wonderful Ph.D.s graduating now that we’d love to be considering,” Smith said. “But my main concern again is to make sure that the faculty and the students and the staff that we have on campus today are well supported.”
Still, bringing in new faculty remains a top priority for some key peer institutions. While FAS has cut its searches from 50 to 21 to cut costs, Princeton and Yale have not reported slashing any hires. 
The discrepancy may have consequences for the academic balance of power. Universities not cutting back on hiring will likely be able to lure more of their top choices than in years past, as the number of available spots for junior professors across the country sinks.
“We’ll probably get a bigger percentage of our offers accepted than usual because we’re usually up against Harvard, Stanford, Princeton,” said Frances M. Rosenbluth, chair of the political science department at Yale. “We’re more likely to get our top picks this year.”
A BUYER’S MARKET?
In Harvard’s economics department, which lost two of its three searches this year, the potentially disadvantaged hiring situation has raised some eyebrows.
“There are a few places that are being smart about this and are stepping up hiring,” said Paul Niehaus, an Economics Ph.D. student at Harvard, who has already done a junior faculty job interview at Yale this year. 
Harvard Economics had its two junior faculty searches cut to one during the hiring slow-down, and—with FAS money tight—was forced to dip into its own departmental reserves to pay for the search. 
Princeton, by contrast, is likely to hire at least five new junior professors for next year, according to Oleg Itskhoki, a Ph.D. student in Economics. That number has not been slashed at all in response to financial conditions, according to Hyun Song Shin, the assistant chair of Princeton’s economics department. 
At the senior faculty level, Harvard’s economics department saw its one search put on hold, while Yale has stayed the course that it set for itself prior to the crisis with between 5 and ten searches, indicating that preserving its commitment to hiring might give it a key edge.
“Of course we hope that other schools will make mistakes and we’ll be able to take advantage,” said Christopher R. Udry, chair of Yale’s economics department. “In the case where other schools panic and overreact, we might be able to make some progress.”
ENDOWMENT MATTERS
Harvard’s decreased hiring reflects more than simple priorities. Yale and Princeton have been able to continue recruiting aggressively in part because they are less dependent on their endowment than FAS, which relies on endowment funding for over half of its budget.
The financial crisis has also hit their endowments with a softer punch: Princeton’s endowment declined 11 percent and Yale’s 13.4 percent in the same time frame that Harvard’s declined by 22 percent. 
European schools, which can rely on a steady flow of income from the government and do not rely on their endowments, also are looking to take advantage of the financial crisis raging at their peer institutions across the Atlantic.
“European schools are really hiring aggressively,” said Itskhoki. “They will be able to get much better students than before.”
Harvard is not the only school that has cut back on searches. 
Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences froze most of its faculty searches—about three dozen, according to Dean Richard P. Saller. Now left with only a dozen searches already “near  completion,” the school will have to wait on fulfilling its plans to build faculty in departments such as East Asian Languages, Saller added.
Columbia, Cornell, and MIT have also slowed down faculty searches.
Itskhoki, the Economics Ph.D. student, said that despite the cuts Harvard might have the upper hand in the long-run, foregoing aggressive hiring now while assuming that it can poach the best young talent later.
“If Harvard thinks that it can easily in a couple of years see who’s going to be really, really good in the current cohort,” Itskhoki said, “they can easily steal those people.”

In a move that will lighten the constraints of earlier financial cutbacks, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith will allow six additional searches for new faculty to go forward in the coming months, he said yesterday. 
The inclusion of the new searches will spell a forty percent increase over the 15 searches that remained authorized in December, when Smith slashed hiring plans by more than half in response to unprecedented losses posted by the University’s endowment.    
The FAS leader declined to elaborate on the source of the funds used to finance the new searches, save that some of them had been made possible by vacancies in endowed professorships, which are supported by restricted funds specifically reserved for departmental teaching positions.
“There is a significant misconception on the part of the national media that Harvard University has suspended faculty searches,” Smith wrote in an informal notice given to The Crimson yesterday. “I can say unequivocally that Harvard has not, will not, and cannot stop searching for new faculty.”
In the wake of December’s hiring slowdown, Smith—who has the final word on authorizations of faculty searches—said he has been working with departments and divisional deans to find more faculty searches that FAS can afford. 
Lizabeth Cohen, chair of the history department, said the administration allowed her unit to continue a search for an endowed professorship for Latin American history because “they would not cost FAS money.”
Departments have also been examining their specific restricted funds to determine any that could be used without interfering with FAS cutbacks, according to Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of the Humanities.
With the six new searches, the administration has now approved searches within 16 departments, as well as two cross-divisional searches in Egyptology and Culture of Medicine.
Yesterday’s notice stated that FAS is conducting a total of 28 searches, only 21 of which fall within its divisions. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, which falls under the FAS umbrella, accounts for the other seven searches, all of which have been authorized since before the onset of the financial crisis, according to SEAS Interim Dean Frans A. Spaepen.  
Though SEAS is a school within FAS, it operates under a different set of financial constraints and uses its own endowment for professorships, according to Spaepen. 
Moreover, the school’s administrators have specific designs on faculty growth—aiming eventually to expand the school’s 60 positions to 100, Spaepen said. 
Fourteen to 16 of the 28 searches now authorized are for junior faculty. There is a range because some of the searches are “open-rank,” or positions that can be filled by either a senior or junior faculty member, according to Smith. 
While Smith emphasized his priority of supporting existing students, faculty, and staff, he said he will continue to look for ways to continue paused searches.
“We know all the searches that were authorized last spring were important to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” Smith said. “We should move forward as hard as we can to get back to a point where we can do this.”

The Faculty Council approved a motion yesterday that would raise the minimum SAT II score necessary to fulfill the Harvard College language requirement from 600 to 700.
The proposal, presented by Romance Languages and Literatures Professor Virginie Greene, would also give students an extra year to fulfill the language requirement, as well as the option to petition for coursework at other institutions—both in the United States and abroad—to count towards its completion.
The motion will go before the full Faculty next Tuesday for a final vote. If approved, the policy would go into effect for next year’s incoming freshmen, the Class of 2013—also the first class that will be uniformly subject to the new General Education requirements.
But the first item on the Council’s agenda was the financial crisis. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith told the Council that he has been receiving multiple plans from different departments and said that he is pleased with discussions on the matter so far.
As part of his continuing response to the current financial crisis, Smith had been working to release details on an ‘80-percent plan’ for cutting the FAS budget at the end of January, but has yet to do so.
Two top administrators also sought to assure the Council that the new General Education program—which currently has 70 courses approved for an incoming freshman class of over 1,600—remains on track. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, who also chairs the Gen Ed committee, said that they are continuing to urge professors to develop new Gen Ed courses.
English Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, who chairs the Task Force on the Arts, presented his committee’s recommendations to the Faculty Council. Speaking at an Undergraduate Council meeting on Monday, University President Drew G. Faust acknowledged that not all of the Task Force’s recommendations would go forward immediately because of the current financial situation.
Hammonds also asked her colleagues to consider what should happen during next year’s inaugural January ‘J-term’—the four-week stint in next year’s revamped University calendar whose structure remains uncertain. Even the name of the period remains unclear. But Hammonds has settled on calling it the “January experience.”

The No. 4 Harvard women’s squash team (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) opened the second half of its season in style, scoring an impressive 7-2 upset win over No. 3 Trinity (8-1) last night at the Barnaby Courts. The victory marked the first win for the Crimson over the Bantams in two years and avenged a 6-3 setback in the first round of last season’s Howe Cup.With top flight sophomore June Tiong out with a back injury, Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa was forced to shuffle his lineup with the majority of the team playing a flight up.“It was really a blessing in disguise,” Bajwa said. “It showed the courage and character of our team that they are not just good [at their position], but that they can step up when they need to.”The Crimson was strong in all flights and in all years. Junior captain No. 6 Johanna Snyder, sophomore No. 9 Alexandra Zindman, and freshman No. 3 Emily Park gave Harvard an early 3-0 advantage with efficient 3-1 victories.Snyder won her match, 9-1, 9-5, 3-9, 9-1. Zindman finished with a final score of 3-9, 9-5, 9-3, 9-1, and Park emerged victorious, 9-6, 2-9, 9-4, 9-2.A 3-9, 9-3, 9-0, 9-1 come-from-behind win by sophomore No. 5 Bethan Williams was offset by a heartbreaking five-game loss at the No. 8 spot. Junior Sandra Mumanachit took a 2-0 lead, but faded late, falling 9-5, 9-4, 8-10, 6-9, 1-9 to Trinity’s Emily Paton.The Crimson won its fifth and clinching match on a thrilling five-game victory by sophomore Alisha Mashruwala at the No. 2 flight. After taking a 2-0 lead and cruising towards her sixth win of the year, Mashruwala was unable to convert on multiple match balls in the third and fourth games. She dropped both by a score of 8-10 to force a deciding fifth game, the first of the season and second of her career.“I came off the court [after the fourth game] telling myself to forget what had just happened,” Mashruwala said. “I went into the fifth like it was the first game and I was just getting into the match.”There was no choking as Mashruwala jumped out to a quick 6-0 lead and held on to win the game, 9-4, and take the match, 3-2.Junior No. 4 Katherine O’Donnell battled in a hard-fought match featuring wild momentum swings and lengthy rallies, ultimately prevailing, 2-9, 9-6, 10-8, 9-0, to raise her season record to 6-0.In the crucial third game, O’Donnell came from behind against Bantam JoAnn Jee to set up the victory.Freshman Nirasha Guruge, playing at the top flight in place of Tiong, fell 3-0, while No. 7 freshman Cece Cortes, playing her first collegiate match, prevailed 3-0, to tally the final score.Ranked No. 3 in the country, Trinity represented the most formidable opponent that Harvard has faced this season. Not only did the team match up against the power and shot-making ability of the Crimson players, but they also challenged the team’s fitness and mental fortitude. Prior to yesterday’s match, Harvard as a team had only played one match out of 45 that extended beyond three games, while yesterday against the Bantams, seven out of the nine matches were decided in four or five games.“You can be fit, but if you are not mentally strong, you can still lose the match,” Bajwa said. “This team stood up to a very stiff challenge from Trinity and should be very proud,” he added.The Crimson came into the match with momentum, having defeated No. 8 Stanford, 8-1, on Jan. 23. The team can only revel in its victory for two days before it continues its brutal stretch of scheduling. Harvard hits the road this weekend to take on No. 2 Penn on Saturday afternoon and No. 1 Princeton on Sunday. The team then returns to Cambridge for its home finale against No. 5 Yale next Wednesday.The Crimson is 2-6 against the three collectively over the past two seasons, but will seek to use the momentum generated by its victory over Trinity to improve on that mark heading into the season-ending Howe Cup.“This win was amazing for everybody on the team. We are going to go in confident, but not too confident,” Mashruwala said. “Everybody is out to beat us now.”—Staff writer Barrett P. Kenny can be reached at bpkenny@fas.harvard.edu.

It’s been three years since the Harvard fencing team won a national championship, and for it, that’s three years too long. But this year, there is one girl who is looking to propel the Crimson back to where it belongs. Freshman sabre fencer Caroline Vloka has proved herself to be key ingredient to the team’s success as Harvard enters the important stretch of its season.“She’s been a great addition to the team,” co-captain Emily Cross said. “She’s really been working hard. It’s definitely difficult to come to school and be at Harvard when you are used to being at home and training. She’s really transitioned very well.”With only three sabre fencers for the women’s team this year, Vloka has been tested in every meet this season and has passed with flying colors.“She is our best sabre fencer and by far ahead of everyone else in the nation,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “[The championship] will be very competitive.”Vloka has filled the void in the sabre in a big way. This season she has gone undefeated at some of the biggest and most important matches, including a 9-0 record at the Beanpot and going 3-0 against Sacred Heart. Perhaps her most exciting outing of the year came against Ohio State and St. John’s. In Queens, N.Y., Vloka defeated US Olympian and Red Storm fencer Dagmara Wozniak as she went undefeated on the day. The victories helped her team to a solid win over the Buckeyes, the defending national champions.“Our sabre team has been up and down in terms of recruits,” Cross said. “It’s difficult as a freshman to be the leader of the team. She’s done a great job. She commits completely. She leads that team very well.”While less difficult for fencers, the transition from high school to college can still be a tough one, as they are forced to leave their homes, where they are able to train for many hours a day in a competitive training facility. In college, there is less time available to practice, and so many rookie fencers struggle throughout their first year.But Vloka has yet to show signs for concern, offering a valiant effort against the top fencers in the country this year. With close losses to some of the nation’s best, including a controversial 5-4 loss to Duke’s Rebecca Ward—a bronze medalist for the US in Beijing—on Sunday, her success comes as no surprise to Brand.“Caroline can make the Olympic team in 2012,” Brand said. “That is contingent on her hard work. If she continues to do the same thing as she is doing now, she’s going to the Olympic games.”Vloka recently traveled to compete in a Junior National tournament—a step toward becoming a member of the Junior National Team. The tournament occurred on one of the only weekends the Harvard fencing team had off, further demonstrating the dedication and passion Vloka has for the sport.“She has four years to train and get better,” Brand said. “The only thing that can stand in her way is school. It can be difficult.” Vloka will need to find a balance over the next four years of school, training, and traveling to national tournaments. But if she continues to work hard and be successful, she just might follow in Cross’ footsteps and represent the US in the Olympics.The parallels between Vloka and Cross are already apparent in Brand’s eyes. He can’t deny the resemblance between his star freshman and veteran captain. “The similarities are the drive and the love of fencing,” Brand said. “You can see in their eyes the way they practice, their tenacity, and resiliency. They have tremendous focus and a goal.”Vloka will look to lead her team to yet another national championship. The Crimson travels to New York City to face Columbia, Yale, and Cornell this weekend in its pursuit of an Ivy title.—Staff writer Melissa Schellberg can be reached at mlschell@fas.harvard.edu.

Though the score may not reflect it, the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team (5-2. 2-1 Ivy) put up a hard-fought battle against longtime-undefeated No. 1 Trinity (11-0). The Crimson fell, 8-1, to the Bantams at the Barnaby Courts last night.
“The score was 8-1, but it doesn’t really reflect that performance,” sophomore Eliot Buchanan said. 
“We came out to play,” he added. “Everybody played tough and it has made us mentally stronger for the next matches coming up.”
Two of the night’s most exciting matches came from junior No. 1 seed Colin West and No. 4 seed Buchanan. 
West was matched against Trinity senior Gustav Detter. West took the first two games, 10-8 and 9-4, but Detter battled back to win the third game, 2-9.
But West regained control by crushing Detter in the final game of the match, 9-2. 
Before this match, Detter was ranked second in the country, while West was ranked fourth. By beating the Swedish native, West will move to either first or second in the country. The win extends West’s undefeated record on the season to 7-0. 
“This was a real big one for me,” West said. “In college squash, you get very few shots to play the top guys. I get one chance in the year; you have to perform on the day. I think this might have been the best I have ever played.”
The other close match of the night came from Buchanan. Though he lost his match, 3-1, Buchanan put up an impressive showing against Bantam sophomore Randy Lim.  Besides West, Buchanan was the only Crimson player to win a match on the night. 
Buchanan especially had to dig deep because he was coming back from injuries suffered during the fall.
“I felt pretty good,” Buchanan said. “I was sick in December and this was my first real test. It was not a bad start to get a game off against my opponent.”
The rest of the Crimson’s seeded players lost to their Trinity counterparts, 3-0, but many of the matches were close. 
In one of the strongest matches of the night, No. 8 freshman Will Ahmed battled hard against Trinity opponent Rushabh Vora but fell in three games, 3-9, 7-9, 2-9. 
In his first two games, No. 6 sophomore Richard Hill put up a good fight against Bantam sophomore Andres Vargas, only losing 6-9 and 5-9, but in the third game Vargas took Hill, 9-0. 
Coming into the match, the Crimson knew it would have an uphill battle. For the past decade, Trinity has been a powerhouse. 
The Bantams have the longest winning streak—195 consecutive games—of any college team in any intercollegiate sport. 
The last time the Crimson had a victory over Trinity was in 1998.
Harvard came into the game with confidence. Quickly leaving behind its upset against Cornell on Dec. 6, the Crimson had won its past two contests against Western Ontario, 7-2, and Rochester, 5-4.
“The coaches and [captain Verdi DiSesa] said you can’t come into the game thinking you are going to lose,” West said. “We came in thinking we could genuinely win, which was a tough task considering who the opponent was.”
As for what the team could improve upon, according to Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa, the team just needs to play more.
“Match practice is what we need,” Bajwa said. “We are not lacking hard work, improvement, courage, and commitment.”
Coming up, the Crimson is facing a tough schedule of matches that will surely be close. 
Harvard will be on the road for its next two games against Penn on Feb. 7 and Princeton on Feb. 8. Though Harvard has an edge over these two teams, the matches are not foregone conclusions.
“We should be favored against Penn,” West said. “But you never know because in the Ancient Eight everyone is very close. The pressure is on us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling one-goal short of beating one of the country’s best teams, the Harvard men’s hockey team will take the ice against another one tonight at 7 p.m when it faces the No. 14 Yale Bulldogs in New Haven, Conn.Playing on the road in between the Beanpot, the Crimson knows that a victory against the Bulldogs would atone for last month’s 6-2 loss at Bright Hockey Center on Jan. 10 in which Harvard allowed three unanswered first period goals.Yale enters the game having amassed 21 points in the ECAC standings, tied with Cornell at the top of the division. In a tight league race in which just three points separate the top four teams, a victory over the Crimson would keep Yale’s strong momentum alive.Yale’s previous three-goal effort set the tone for the game and prevented Harvard from defining the dynamic. Though the Crimson appeared to be mounting a rally in the second period, it was lack of focus and untimely penalties that let Yale run away with the game and drove Harvard to frustration. Both teams took ten-minute game misconduct penalties in the closing moments.“Yale’s got a great team. They always play us tough,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “I think we have acknowledged this week that we know they’re one of the best teams—if not the hottest team—in the country. We know that we have to play our best if we’re going to have success.” The Bulldogs have put 72 goals on the board in the first 21 games of the season, outscoring opponents by a total of 20.Shutting down forwards Sean Backman, Broc Little, and Mark Arcobello, all of whom have tallied more than 10 goals on the season–and have combined to contribute more than a third of the Bulldogs’ scoring–represents a primary concern for the Crimson.“I think one of their biggest assets is the fact that their offense is probably the most skilled offense in league,” junior Alex Biega said. “They have very creative and quick forwards, always making plays down low and around the net. They have the ability to capitalize on all their opportunities.”Yale brings a four-game winning streak into tomorrow night’s game, as the Bulldogs have demonstrated the ability to defeat some of the best teams in the league.The run began with a 4-3 win over Cornell and saw Yale emerge victorious over Colgate, Princeton, and Quinnipiac. “It’s a big game being the Harvard-Yale rivalry but also its a chance for us to beat a team that’s highly rated and start putting together wins for our team,” Biega said.As the rematch approaches, Harvard’s offense may be finding its stride when the games matter most.Biega and junior Doug Rogers have combined for 13 points in three games. Biega managed to feed his teammates six assists while Rogers has found the back of the net four times in the three-game stretch and notched three assists.“Both those guys are keys to our power-play and our success. In the last couple of years, whenever we’ve had success, those guys have gotten on the score sheet,” Fraser said. “Even though they’ve been playing well, they’ve been struggling to put the puck on net, but as of late they’ve been hot.”Turning on the offense will help the Crimson do something that most of Yale’s opponents have found difficult. Though Yale’s defensemen have proven adept at forming part of the offensive charge, Harvard aims to keep the puck at Yale’s end of the ice and force the Bulldogs defensive squad to focus on clearing the puck.“I think we’ll have success, because our forwards are very successful at cycling the puck and creating shots. Their D is very suspect at having to play defense, and even though they can play an offensive game on the rush, if we make them play defense, we’ll definitely prevent them from finding success.”The close loss against the Terriers confirms that the Crimson have the talent to compete against the nation’s best squads.“We’ve proven that we can skate with anyone and that’s a specific way we have to play and everyone has to be on board and on the same page,” Biega said. “If we execute tomorrow, we have the best chance to find success.”—Staff writer Robert T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team beat Yale, “Let Me Love You” by Mario topped the Billboard Hot 100 and Hitch reigned over the box office.Since then, the Bulldogs have taken six straight from the Crimson. Harvard (9-9, 1-3 Ivy) hopes to reverse that trend this weekend in its penultimate slate of home games. The Crimson faces Yale (7-11, 2-2 Ivy) tonight and Brown (6-12, 0-4 Ivy) tomorrow night at Lavietes Pavilion. Last weekend, Harvard dropped a pair of close games to Penn and Princeton at home. The losses, part of a three-game losing streak, were largely a product of errant free-throw shooting and poor transition defense.“We feel like we can just dig and scrap and claw a little bit more...and make it more difficult for people to get interior shots,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s going to be big for us this weekend coming up against Yale and Brown.”The Bulldogs enter this weekend losers of their last two games but tied for third in the Ivy League. Led by a pair of second team All-Ivy selections in the frontcourt–senior Travis Pinick and team captain Ross Morin–Yale poses a serious challenge to the Crimson’s big men.“The concern we’re going to have is their ability to pound the interior,” Amaker said. “They have the physical size and strength up front.”This matchup is especially problematic in light of the injuries plaguing Harvard’s frontcourt. Junior forward Doug Miller, who had started every game during a breakout season, suffered a foot injury last weekend and will miss extended action. This setback comes while junior forward Pat Magnarelli recovers from a shoulder injury and senior forward Evan Harris recuperates from knee surgery.In the meantime, the Crimson will need someone to step up and fill the middle.“We’ve got Evan coming back to hopefully get some minutes and obviously [freshman forward] Keith [Wright] and [freshman forward] Peter Boehm will have to play more than they’ve been playing,” Miller said. “[Freshman center] Peter Swiatek too.  [Swiatek] played well at the beginning of the year. He hasn’t had that many minutes lately, but he is capable of stepping in and being effective.”Tonight’s game, though it’s not The Game, still affects the pageantry associated with Harvard-Yale. “I think our kids will be very excited because we want to play well, we’re at home, and we’d like to see if we can win,” Amaker said. “But I think certainly, because it’s Yale, there’s a little extra incentive.”“I’ve learned about that since I’ve been here,” he added.Tomorrow night, the Crimson faces a similar test against Brown. The Bears come into Cambridge without a league win, having lost to Yale twice, as well as Columbia and Cornell. Last year, Brown swept Harvard in the season series, winning 71-51 in Providence and 81-65 in Cambridge. The Bears feature three scorers averaging double digits, junior forward Matt Mullery, sophomore forward Peter Sullivan, and sophomore guard Adrian Williams at 15.7, 14.1, and 12.6 points-per-game respectively. While Sullivan and Williams are prolific outside shooters, the catalyst for Brown’s offence is their big man, Mullery.“The big kid is the key. He shoots a high percentage...he’s one of the top scorers [in the league]. He’s a load in there,” Amaker said. “I think they play off of him and play through him. And that for us is an area that we’re very much concerned with.” In the midst of a three-game losing streak, this weekend offers the Crimson a chance to right the ship and climb back up in the Ivy League standings.“They’ve handled the attention and notoriety and all the glitz and glamour that came their way because of a strong performance a little bit ago,” Amaker said. “They’ve come back to work, and been enthusiastic. And I think that they’re eager and anxious to see if we can stop the slide on Friday.”—Staff writer Timothy J. Walsh can be reached at twalsh@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Don’t let the records fool you, ladies and gentlemen. After the first four games of the Ivy regular season, there is a clear number one and a clear number two. Number one, everyone is in agreement on, especially after holding Yale to a measly 36 points in a 60-36 stomping last weekend. Cornell is the best team in the Ivies, and looking like it is only getting better.But number two: that title must go to Columbia. Although the team is all but out of the Ivy running after two losses to the Big Red, they may have pushed Cornell as much as the team will be pushed all year. The Lions took a 5-point lead into the break at home, before the Big Red brought it on to snag a 71-57 win.Look what happened the next weekend: Columbia trounced the Bulldogs, picked third in the conference, Cornell held the Bulldogs to just 34 points, and Penn, second in the preseason rankings, lost by three to Dartmouth.So the top two are clear. The rest is a mess.Harvard fell off the map last weekend, dropping two winnable games at home. Yale laid an egg on the offensive end. And Princeton looks strong. I’m sorry, they look strong-er than last year, which isn’t saying much.That’s what this weekend is for—we’ll see whether the last was an aberration, if Harvard and Yale can rally, or if it was a harbinger of more messed up things to come.YALE AT HARVARD  On Friday night, this is the game to watch in the Ivy League. The preseason’s third and fourth ranked teams are reeling. Yale (7-11, 2-2 Ivy) is in better shape than the Crimson to make a run at the title, if the squad can somehow turn things around. But, after scoring 78 total points last weekend, that seems unlikely.Harvard will have no trouble scoring, as it seems to have found a solution to its offensive struggles of late—make free throws. The Crimson could have won games against Dartmouth and Penn at home with some makes, but showed recent improvement against Princeton. The new guard tandem of senior Drew Housman and freshman standout Oliver McNally should make a difference, if Amaker stays with it. In the end, Yale is struggling too much and Harvard has too much talent. If it can learn to win, this should be its game for the taking.Harvard 65, Yale 59COLUMBIA AT PENNPenn had a chance to snag big points in the Ivy race if it could have won two on the road last weekend. It took care of the hard one at Harvard on Friday with a big 66-61 win, and Dartmouth looked to be a pushover. But Dartmouth senior Alex Barnett, frontrunner for Ivy Player of the Year, showed up strong, scorching Penn for 24 points. It will be interesting to see how the Quakers respond. They have talent—freshman Zach Rosen played tremendously against the Crimson and sophomores Jack Eggleston and Tyler Bernardini provide a decent one-two punch.And don’t forget one thing—this will be played at the Palestra, which still packs a wallop in the Ivy League. Columbia won both its games last weekend in front of a raucous crowd of its own, and they may struggle in this road contest. Penn 63, Columbia 61CORNELL at PRINCETONOne thing’s for sure about Princeton: this team has a kid who can shoot the leather of a basketball in freshman Doug Davis. The frontrunner for Ivy Rookie of the Year, Davis is averaging 13.7 points per game, and is coming off two strong performances in two big wins for the Tigers.Unfortunately for Princeton, Cornell has one of the best guards in the league in junior Louis Dale, to go with fellow junior sensation Ryan Wittman–the preseason favorite for Ivy Player of the Year–averaging 18.7 points per game, second behind Dartmouth’s Barnett.The Tigers are tough at home, but as hard and as ironic as it is for me to say, it’s still just Princeton. They come back to earth this weekend.Cornell 72, Princeton 55CORNELL at PENNThis is the big one. The game that all the Ivy League will be looking toward. The whole enchalada. The whole kid and kaboodle. The whole—stop me, please.The Palestra, the raucous crowd, the old guard of Penn’s past championships, the new guard in Cornell’s dynamic team.If Cornell is to lose any game this season, it could be this one. If Bernardini, Rosen, Eggleston, and crew can play the way they did late at Harvard, it could be hard for the Big Red to overcome.But it won’t be. Frankly, Penn is too young, and Cornell is too good.Cornell 68, Penn 62BROWN at HARVARDAll this talk of Ivy League Player of the Year races got me to thinking—I forgot the people’s favorite, Mr. Jermemy Lin. He’s one of only a handful of players in all of NCAA basketball to be in the top ten in every major category in his league–points, steals, rebounds, assists, FT percentage, 3-point percentage—you name it, he’s up right at the top.If the team can respond and post a good record this year, he may take home the prize. But, as Harvard says every season, there’s always next year. Harvard must have this game or it may risk a repeat of last year’s historic slide.Harvard 69, Brown 58COLUMBIA at PRINCETONIt’s tough for any team to take two games on the Killer P’s home courts. After a deflating loss to Penn the night before, I suspect Columbia will come out strong against Princeton.The Tigers will also be bruised and battered from the pounding they took a night before courtesy of the juggernaut that is the Big Red. Advantage: Lions.Columbia 58, Princeton 50YALE at DARTMOUTHWho is going to stop Alex Barnett? He’s it for Dartmouth, but at home, he’s been able to get the team two big wins. It all depends on which Bulldog squad shows up, but I expect them to shut down Barnett. Yale gets a much-needed win. Yale 56, Dartmouth 52—Staff writer Walter E.

Non-observational painting or paint therapy? VES Lecturer Drew Beattie asked his students to dig deep and throw everything they found onto canvas. The results were displayed at the VES 25: Non-Observational Painting open house on January 9. Roving Reporter showed up to admire the artwork and bother people.Drew Beattie, Lecturer on Visual and Environmental StudiesRR: What is your middle initial?DB: I don’t really use it.RR: Sure, but it’s The Crimson’s style to attribute people using their middle initials.DB: No.RR: Okay. So what were you trying to get your students to accomplish in this class?DB: Well, it’s technically a beginning class, so I’m trying to get students to use an alternate language to engage with painting. It’s non-observational, so you’re dealing with imagined structures.RR: And everyone was on board with that?DB: I give a big spiel during shopping week, so I tend to draw people who are into that sort of thing. [Rudolf Arnheim Lecturer on Studio Arts] Nancy Mitchnik also teaches a foundational observational painting class.RR: Do you guys have a rivalry? Non-observational versus observational?DB: No, we’re buddies. Sometimes it’s useful to pretend that we do, but we don’t really. I think it’s important for Harvard students to practice speculative making, doing as thinking. It’s about thingness, not theory.Ian R. Merrifield ‘12RR: What do we have here?IRM: Well, we started out with ten little paintings that were inspired from a list of like, 200 phrases. Then for the final painting we were supposed to loosely combine them into one big painting, somehow synthesize them. Conceptually it’s incredibly difficult to go from something so small to something so large...I had never worked with oil before this painting—the other paintings were in acrylic. Acrylic is cool, but oil is much more seductive. You get to sit there and play with it...I’m dealing with some pretty loaded imagery. One of the first things our professor said in the final critique was that there aren’t many more loaded images than Christ on the cross. I wanted to ask, “What sort of modern world needs to be saved with another round of crucifixions?” That’s the conceptual idea I started with.RR: Is this going home to mom and dad?IRM: I live in California, so it would probably be pretty expensive. Plus, I’m not sure they would be happy with a painting with a lot of crucifixions. I’m not sure they would want to put it up in their house.Eamon F. Fleming ‘10RR: What do you think of your friend’s painting?EFF: I think it’s great.RR: What is it?EFF: It looks like a guy in the street.RR: Why is the guy’s head so small?EFF: Probably, because it’s the farthest thing away.RR: Has he grown as a painter since you’ve known him?EFF: We don’t really know him as a painter. He’s always sitting around drawing, sketching with paint markers and stuff. A lot of it is hip-hop inspired. Straight gangster rap.Sophie R. Wharton ‘11 and Madeleine A. Bennett ‘11RR: What do you think of the paintings?SRW: I’m very impressed. Our friend has practically lived here, so it’s nice to see the end result.RR: So was she successful?SRW: Of course! She’s a dancer, and I can see a lot of the same talent in her paintings.MAB: All of the paintings here are so different. There’s a lot of self-expression. Cartoons next to big splotches.SRW: I like the monsters. They’re cute in a freakish way.RR: Do you think people are exorcising their Harvard frustrations?MAB: More of this would be pretty healthy for the school.—Staff Writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.
