After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While doomscrolling through Instagram, I often come across a kind of post that really bothers me. Sometimes found on the accounts of people I otherwise admire and whose work I deeply appreciate is the quote “There’s no ethical consumption under capitalism,” followed by the activist’s personal rendition of an argument that goes something like: “Screw ‘ethical consumption.’ It’s an elitist and self-righteous practice that intentionally excludes the working class.” Typically, they then conclude by saying that we’d be much better off focusing our energy elsewhere.
Don’t get me wrong: It isn’t lost on me why someone would believe this. Corporations often try to shift the blame for climate change and their other capitalist excesses on individuals, asking that we do our part to mitigate these issues when the blame, by and large, lies at their feet. The argument for conscious consumption also calls for a sense of individual responsibility, an idea haunted (on the left, anyway) by the specter of neoliberalism.
The developed arguments behind the posts probably aren’t too bad, either: Those opposed to the practice often say that “ethical consumers” are mistaken in thinking they make a difference. For example, realistically speaking, individual veganism does nothing to reduce the effects of factory farming on climate change. So these critics argue that the money and energy used on conscious consumption would hence be better spent on donating to environmental organizations and lobbying for comprehensive policy change. There’s no gotcha here. The numbers all add up.
Still, I find myself reluctant to say that conscious consumption doesn’t matter.
We can separate the motivations behind conscious consumption into two camps: a desire to promote sustainability and a desire to align consumption with morality. I think the argument outlined above places far too much weight on the first motivation while discarding the second as sanctimony. But I feel that conscious consumption is far more about doing the right thing than it is about effecting change. Much as the majority of vegans are vegan because they believe in animal rights, I choose to boycott Amazon, among other corporate juntas, because I refuse to support its repugnant labor practices. I suffer no false pretenses that my decision to abstain from Amazon is substantially impacting its revenue, which increased dramatically over the course of the pandemic. In other words, both the vegans and I know that our decisions aren’t changing anything: we choose conscious consumption because we believe that to choose  otherwise would be wrong.
Moreover, I think the idea that conscious consumption is a luxury that low-income people cannot afford feels strawman-ish at best and very misguided at worst. The argument for conscious consumption is not that someone should place themselves in debt or make otherwise poor financial decisions to comply with its tenets; calls for conscious consumption — at least the ones from people with a brain and heart — are clearly directed towards people who have the ability to choose how they consume in the first place.
It also seems to me that posts like these misunderstand good faith calls for conscious consumption. Laden in them is the idea that conscious consumption is about asserting your moral superiority and feeling good about yourself, maybe even absolving some of your capitalist guilt along the way. By this view, the quintessential conscious consumer is the corner-office girlboss who swipes her platinum Amex for some sustainably sourced Bonsai fertilizer with one hand and types up her latest Boston Consulting Group memo with the other.
What this caricature misses is that conscious consumption is a moral framework about making the most conscious and informed decision that you feasibly can and is informed by the same moral commitments that presumably guide every other facet of your life. So while the desire to consume consciously might lead someone to make certain his flowers are farm-to-coffee table, it would also demand that he abstain, whenever possible, from purchasing water from companies that colonize Indigenous springs.
Really, here lies the problem: in their supposed concern for the lower class, these posts legitimize their abuse. Its sweeping claim that conscious consumption is a worthless endeavor flies in the face of the truth that any other kind of consumption relies on and reinforces the mistreatment of oppressed people. So, while it is true that we need large-scale societal change, the anti-“ethical consumption" crowd completely dismisses commitment to one’s ethical values — and chief among mine is a dedication to the marginalized.
I’ve seen some people on Twitter suggest that we should replace “There’s no ethical consumption under capitalism,” as much as it continues to ring true, with Theodor Adorno’s “Wrong life cannot be lived rightly.” Wrong as Adorno was about many things, this strikes me as the right position today. The point here isn’t that worries about the impact of consumption are irrelevant, as many a  Shein hauler on TikTok would have us believe, but that consumption as it currently exists is definitionally bound up with exploitation.
Sometimes we don’t have any good choices, but that doesn’t take away from our responsibility to live the least wrong life we can. Even in our twisted consumptive landscape, we can choose to pay people more for their time and to make the effort to engage in as little exploitation as we can. And maybe these concerns are self-righteous; maybe it doesn’t matter whether we take advantage of people’s suffering if they’ll suffer anyway. Then again, I’d rather be self-righteous than willingly do wrong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past summer, Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that he will be stepping down from his role by June 2023, marking the end of an uncharacteristically short and tumultuous five-year stint as Harvard’s top leader. Before the next academic year, we will lose the crimson devil we knew: the omnipresent and familiar, if frequently frustrating, face of our university.
With almost two full terms to go, Bacow’s legacy is not quite set in stone. Yet there is little doubt that his tenure as president of Harvard will be remembered for the amount and difficulty of the extraordinary challenges he faced, and for his partial success in confronting them.
Only halfway through Bacow’s term, a deadly global pandemic shut the world down. Harvard was forced into crisis mode: Campus evacuations, online schooling, and employee status with the backdrop of a physically empty campus became hot button issues. With the benefit of hindsight, the University’s response to covid could have been much better. At the time, however, little information was available to administrators and leaders, who were largely forced to fly blindly through the proverbial storm. We stand by our precedents in support of Harvard’s decisions that we feel protected and prioritized faculty, staff, and students, and we are grateful for the tough decisions that Bacow undoubtedly made at the time in our interest.
Bacow’s defense of the student body did not end with Covid: When the State Department initially refused to issue visas for international students taking courses online due to the pandemic, Bacow staunchly and vocally opposed the decision and played a large role in the policy being overturned. By doing so he kept the student body whole and protected some of its most vulnerable members, and we are particularly appreciative of this use of his personal advocacy. Bacow also oversaw an unparalleled expansion into STEM with the opening of the SEC, a $1 billion investment that is sure to broaden and enrich academic life at Harvard.
But Bacow’s administration wasn’t always so responsive. When it came to campus’ various divest movements, Bacow failed to provide timely or even post facto support to some of Harvard’s most notable student organizers. When the University, under his tenure, finally agreed to divest from fossil fuels and withdrew its investments in the externally traded funds that concentrated our private prison assets, President Bacow had an unparalleled opportunity to earn our peers’ respect. Instead, his controversial past statements and refusal to acknowledge the student activists he had decried when announcing the change of policy unnecessarily antagonized advocates. By refusing to recognize divestment’s activism even amidst what was objectively good news for the group’s base, Bacow transformed a proud high point of campus activism into an under-celebrated, bittersweet event.
Although the Legacy of Slavery report that he piloted was a step in the right direction towards justice and an uncharacteristic acknowledgment of Harvard’s role in historical oppression, we found it lacking in concrete ambitions, and were frustrated that it failed to recognize the potential that a project of its scope has. We are similarly disappointed by his lack of response to student calls for other issues on campus such as the long-desired multicultural center.
But none of those issues are quite as disappointing as the setbacks to diversity on campus that we might yet experience under Bacow’s presidency. An unfavorable Supreme Court decision in the anti-affirmative action Students for Fair Admission lawsuit against the University is likely only months away. While the case did not begin under his tenure, it will likely be linked to his name by nature of the press coverage the case received while he was president. Despite having a limited role, we deem it likely that his name will become inextricably linked to the reversal of decades’ worth of affirmative action admissions at top-tier U.S. universities.
Harvard Presidents must walk a tight line between administrator and academic, satisfying an array of political, educational, and institutional responsibilities. If his predecessors showcased an excessive lean towards either of the extremes, Bacow charted a tight and steady course through the middle, offering few if any explicit glimpses of his personal views (free speech! support Ukraine!), while proving a shockingly competent administrator. Overall, Bacow’s track record was hardly bad, given the havoc — global pandemic, protests against racial injustice, decaying democracy, attacks on our admissions system — his administration faced.
That might seem at odds with our standard critical opinions on the administration. But it isn’t.
As an editorial board, we have an idiosyncratically adversarial relationship with Harvard’s administrators. They find themselves repeatedly in our crosshairs, subject to attacks for lackluster responses to sexual assault, poor messaging on crucial issues, and irresponsible investment decisions. President Bacow, as the most public-facing university administrator, rarely escaped our scrutiny
That dynamic is not wrong per se, nor is it new. Our editors are young students with little actual power over University policy; we are idealists who offer, at the best of times, noble, ambitious policy goals of varied feasibility. University administrators, including Harvard University Presidents, actually control the levers of our institutional policy and know their seemingly paralyzing complexity — proving, in our eyes, too content with an unsatisfactory status quo.
Larry Bacow’s presidency perfectly embodies that old-school approach. We deem it likely that, at times, he thought of our editorial board as pretentious and excessively rightful, a handful of spoiled, naively ideological students with little experience and an excessively large microphone. We certainly didn’t always regard him as a steadfast keeper of our peers’ best interests.
That much made our rhetorical dynamic contentious. It is also, for the most part, the way things are supposed to run: Students across campus push for radical reform, administrators refuse but eventually tend to cave and accept a compromise of sorts. Sometimes the progress made is substantial, sometimes it isn’t. The tug of war for a better campus continues.
Bacow’s tenure will perhaps be remembered as that of an old-school president on a new-age campus. He was enamored with the artistry of nuanced moderation, sometimes seeming more enthusiastic about policy constraints than their possibilities. His student body, present company included, was increasingly unsatisfied with that approach — unsatisfied with the lackluster response to a global reckoning on police violence, unsatisfied with the departure of top-tier Black faculty, unsatisfied with a personal brand that appeared built on a condescending demeanor towards deep reform.
But Bacow’s approach had its own silver linings. The president’s commitment to free speech never excluded our criticisms of his missteps — criticisms we will continue to engage in during the last year of his tenure. It also extended, remarkably, to commentary that he vehemently disagreed with. Last year, at a point of intense scrutiny on our own board — at a time when our critics ranged from sitting senators to former University presidents — and despite public pressure on him to the contrary, President Bacow reaffirmed his commitment to the free press and our own editorial independence. That he did so while expressing disappointment at “the quality of discourse” on campus was nothing but another example of his endearingly predictable personal style.
That kind of decisive adherence to certain ideals, even ideals we don’t necessarily profess in the same terms — like his strict, purist understanding of free speech or his gradual approach to change — is rare and worth praising. It represents a sort of remarkable ideological coherence that we might, someday, come to miss.
Farewell, President Bacow.

Harvey C. Mansfield received his undergraduate and PhD degrees in Government from Harvard. He has taught political philosophy since 1969. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Fifteen Minutes: You’re originally from New Haven. So why didn’t you go to Yale?
HCM: I don’t know. My father was teaching there at the time. I can’t give a good reason. But having chosen Harvard, I’m strictly deep-dyed crimson.
FM: How did you first become interested in political philosophy?
HCM: I was a Gov major and I took Government courses. The first political philosophy was not until I was a junior. I wanted to be a Soviet expert. That was my first thought. So as a freshman, I took Russian. And then I figured out that I didn’t want to spend my life reading Communist propaganda or memos or whatever, [and that] archives and political philosophy would be much more interesting, and I guess I found that to be the case.
FM: Today, you’re one of the most visible conservative faculty members on campus. Were you always a conservative, or have your political views shifted over time?
HCM: My political views shifted just about the time I graduated. I was a liberal through my undergraduate time, voted for Adlai Stevenson. I think that’s pretty much the last Democrat I voted for as president. The issue on which I changed was communism. I thought that the liberals were too weak on communism, in opposing it. So I was less interested in the domestic aspects of conservatism, and actually, that’s still the case with me. I’m mainly interested in foreign policy and keeping America strong and vigilant.
FM: On that subject, a recent survey in the Crimson found that 80 percent of surveyed faculty identify as liberal. Do you see that ideological imbalance as an issue on campus?
HCM: Yes, it’s a terrific issue. It’s an issue which is not accepted as an issue by most of my colleagues and by the university, generally. They don’t think it’s a problem that Harvard is mocked by half the country for the things which it does gratuitously, to provoke them. The Harvard Commencement is something like the Democratic National Convention. And that’s a hell of a way to run a university, to maintain its impartiality and its devotion to veritas, to truth, just to go out of your way to provoke people who happen to have different politics, instead of inviting them to come and even just give a talk. How can that be in Harvard’s interest?
As to hiring, I don’t think a conservative has been hired in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the last decade. And it’s probably been going on longer than that. Maybe there’s one or two, but if so, they stay hidden. Because if you’re conservative and want to get on with your colleagues, you have to indulge in self-censorship, and I think a number of students do that as well. But I can’t get my colleagues to think of this as a problem.
FM: What do you think Harvard could do to try to improve ideological diversity on campus?
HCM: It would be easy to simply have the president or the deans invite conservative speakers, have a lecture series. You should just confront the objectors and the protesters. You should take them on. I think most people are in favor of free speech, and it isn’t free if you’ve got only one side. So that’s something which could be done immediately, starting right now. Whereas hiring, that would take a very long time to correct.
And they could change the Commencement. One year you could have a liberal, and the next year a conservative. That would improve things mightily. I've said that to several presidents, and they usually respond, ‘Well, we want Commencement to be fun, and not to be a protest.’ But if you say that you surrender to the protesters.
FM: In the description for your Democracy and Inequality course this semester, you describe books like Plato’s “Republic” and Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America” as “beautiful books.” Why are these books still relevant, and how do you evaluate a work to know if it’s a classic?
HCM: Well, a classic book is a book that treats permanent problems, not passing ones. Permanent problems like democracy and inequality. And they’re beautiful books because every word in them counts. They’re, in some ways, easy to read, because it’s not crazy or irrational or confused. But they’re thought-provoking, so it can take a very long time to read a page, or you can go through quickly. It’s good to do both. And, of course, they’re beauties of style. Beauty of form and expression and thought. And it’s just the intelligence that makes a book worth reading long after you’ve died.
FM: Do you think your political views impact what type of students take your class?
HCM: Yes, they smoke me out. It’s funny. A few years ago, I gave a freshman seminar on Gulliver’s Travels, and it was given in the fall, so this was the first course they were taking at Harvard. Gradually it turned out, as the weeks passed on, that this was a pretty conservative bunch. They had somehow located me as a friendly voice before they got here, or as soon as they got here. Just talking about Gulliver’s Travels, why would that be conservative? It isn’t, really.
FM: Do you see that self-selection as a problem?
HCM: Sure, it’s a problem. It would be good if I could get more liberals. And I think about what I could say that would attract them that wouldn’t spoil my message or force me to say things that I don’t think are correct.
FM: I know you are conservative, but are you a Trump supporter?
HCM: No. I voted for him in 2020. I’m definitely not a Democrat. He did some things that Republicans like, and some things that they don’t — all his boorishness. So for the Democrats, they put those together. Whereas to a Republican like me, there were some good things that I liked, like his Supreme Court appointments, tax cut, the turn against China, things like that. But then, the January 6 thing, I crossed him off my list totally. I never want to see him again. Because that was what I feared and a lot of other people feared would happen during his presidency, but didn’t quite. I think he’s had a very bad influence on America and on the Republicans, and they need to get rid of him.
FM: Your 2006 book, “Manliness,” defended biological differences between the sexes and received a lot of pushback. Have your views on those differences changed since?
HCM: No, they haven’t. They’ve been confirmed, in my view. I think we should profit from the virtues of each of the two sexes. There’s a lot of overlap, so if I start listing these things, you can immediately think of many exceptions, like manliness. In fact, the first manly person that I mentioned in my book is Margaret Thatcher, just to show my good faith. But something like that prevails more in the male sex than with women. I think that’s important.
We’ve seen since the women’s movement that women do a perfectly good job as doctors, lawyers, professors, and so on. And so it’s good to exploit that kind of intellectual talent, which otherwise gets overlooked, not developed, when women just stay at home. But I think that the way in which women live and the way they think remains different. With their career, they’re always thinking about being a mother, too. And that’s the difficulty of it, because they require opposite traits. To be good at a career, you have to focus. To be good as a mother, you have to be open. That women have something like a maternal instinct I think is quite true and obvious and should be accepted. But to be a good mother is to be different from a man or a father, in many ways. You shouldn’t think of the two as just substitutable, or that the virtues of either can be dismissed as useless or harmful.
FM: I don’t know if you’re on Twitter, but some students on Twitter have complained about some off-color comments you’ve made in class that could be offensive. Is that something you try to do intentionally?
HCM: A little bit. I want to keep the parameters of free speech, so I try to test the borders sometimes. Certainly I am sexist. I say that plainly. I think there are differences in the sexes, and I think they ought to be respected, and to some extent laughed about. It’s good for men and women to tease each other. And it’s very bad for students as they do today to take offense so easily.
FM: For all your criticism of Harvard, you’ve been here since 1969. What do you like about Harvard that has stayed consistent throughout your time here?
HCM: The one thing that’s stayed pretty constant is the students I get in my courses. High quality and interested and lively, intelligent. The students are still that way despite the changes in sex and race. You know, if I couldn’t see, I wouldn’t notice a difference. That’s been a kind of success I would say of Harvard and Harvard admissions, the ability to attract the best students.
FM: In 2012, you told our magazine that you didn’t have plans to retire just yet. Is retirement on the horizon now?
HCM: This will probably be my last year, [but] I haven’t declared it or decided. I just turned 90. That’s pretty old.
FM: What’s the story behind your signature fedora?
HCM: I went to England on a Fulbright after I graduated. I loved the way the Englishmen dressed, so I got sort of an appetite for an American version, to dress up a little and also to wear a hat. It keeps you cool in summer and warm in winter, and it looks classy and sets you apart.
FM: What do you like to do on a day off? 
HCM: I’m a most ardent fan of Harvard and Boston teams, and pretty much all the sports. I’m at every Harvard football game at home. Away, I only go to New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Dining Services rolled out a new meal plan for graduate students this fall, which features an expanded offering of campus cafe locations and extends to Harvard Extension School students.
The new program, called GradPlus, allows students to purchase a declining balance meal plan with $400 allotted for the fall semester and $500 allotted for the spring semester. GradPlus also includes a 10 percent discount for any purchase made with the meal plan.
The meal plan can be used at six HUDS cafes, located at Harvard Law School, Harvard Kennedy School, the Science and Engineering Complex, Harvard Divinity School, the School of Public Health, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
According to HUDS Director of Communications Crista Martin, the new meal plan was developed over the summer to support students who otherwise would not have a residential meal plan during the academic year.
“It is an effort to extend our numerous professional school and campus cafes as welcoming venues for the community connections that happen outside the classroom,” Martin wrote in an emailed statement. “We are excited to create inclusive spaces and healthy meals that foster these connections.”
Previously, graduate students had the option of enrolling in the GSAS Commons Meal Plan, which offered two dinners per week plus a declining balance allotment that could only be used at the GSAS Commons.
Extension School students did not qualify for enrollment in the previous plan, according to Kody Christiansen, President of the Harvard Extension Student Association.
Christiansen said he had tried unsuccessfully to register for the GSAS Commons Meal Plan last fall. He said he was told HUDS did not have access to the billing accounts of HES students, though he was eventually able to join the plan after a month of communications with HUDS and the GSAS Student Life Office.
The new GradPlus plan welcomes HES students to join through credit card payments, according to the HUDS website.
Christiansen said having access to a meal plan ensures food security.
“As college students, no matter what age you are, sometimes funds run low,” he said. “With a meal plan, you have food security because you’ve already paid for it and it’s there — especially with a meal plan through Harvard, there’s always going to be food there.”
Aamenah Qutbuddin, an HES student, said she wanted to enroll in the GradPlus meal plan as a way to feel more included in campus life as a Harvard student.
“I want to be able to meet as many people as I can during my time here, and one way to do that is to be able to have access to the dining halls because you know, the best conversation happens over good food,” Qutbuddin said.
“I've spoken to a lot of degree-seeking candidates who don't feel as integrated into Harvard, and I think this is just one step to help people feel more included,” she added.
Christiansen also said that having the new meal plan would be helpful for degree-seeking Extension School students that are moving to Cambridge to complete their on-campus course requirements.
“Breaking bread together with classmates is one of the quintessential college experiences. I just think it's really important to have the access — to have the ability to get a meal plan and to share a meal,” Christiansen said.

A paper published last month by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard-affiliated economic research group, shed new light on the ties between social connections and economic mobility, finding a strong link between cross-class Facebook friendships and economic outcomes.
The paper, titled “Social Capital II: Determinants of Economic Connectedness,” was the second of two papers led by Economics professor Nadarajan "Raj" Chetty investigating the effect of social ties across socioeconomic classes and economic mobility. The dataset used for the research — 72.2 million Facebook users and some Instagram accounts — represents by far the largest sample size of any study conducted on the topic.
Using a machine learning algorithm, the researchers estimated the socioeconomic status of each user in the dataset based on information from their Facebook profile, such as location, phone model, and education. The first paper found a strong link between the “economic connectedness” of an area — the “share of high-[socioeconomic status] friends among individuals with low [socioeconomic status]” — and the economic mobility of that area.
The second paper found two equally important barriers to economic connectedness: “exposure” to people of higher socioeconomic status and “friending bias,” defined as “the tendency for people with low [socioeconomic status] to befriend people with high [socioeconomic status] at lower rates even conditional on exposure.”
There are not “any ironclad explanations” for what causes “friending bias,” said Economics Ph.D. candidate Drew Johnston, a co-author of the paper, but researchers have identified some correlating factors.
“One of the things we found that was kind of striking was that smaller schools tended to have lower levels of bias, perhaps because there weren't enough people in there to allow it to segment into different groups,” Johnston said.
Florian Mudekereza, an Opportunity Insights pre-doctoral fellow who co-authored the paper, wrote in an email that “institutional structure” can also play a role in determining “friending bias.” He wrote that the portion of the second paper focusing on “friending bias” in high school stood out.
“What struck me the most is the fact that high schools with [a] history of conducting academic tracking tend to have relatively high friending bias,” Mudekereza wrote.
But the root cause of friending bias has yet to be found, Fluegge said.
“It’s a great area for future research because what we’ve documented is that it’s quantitatively really important,” he said.

In a Tuesday webinar, the Charles River Watershed Association urged Allston-Brighton residents to advocate for a review of flood risks in the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s Allston Multimodal I-90 Project.
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation launched the Allston Multimodal I-90 Project in 2014 with the vision of replacing the Allston Interchange and improving the “livability, connectivity, and open space” in Allston, per the project’s website. The project has not yet undergone a complete state and federal environmental review.
The project currently has a Sept. 13 deadline for public comment on its most recent design, published in August. CRWA, an advocacy group dedicated to the preservation of the Charles River, hosted Tuesday’s webinar in the hopes of empowering residents to submit informed comments.
The meeting included a presentation of a climate impact review, which detailed flooding risks associated with the project’s design.
Dira Johanif, an urban resilience advocate at CRWA, began the presentation by calling attention to “climate vulnerable” populations within Allston-Brighton, such as those of low-income backgrounds and people with disabilities.
Johanif said the current project site faces many challenges — bank erosion, trash and pollution, low connectivity for walkers and bikers, and a lack of stormwater treatment.
“This neighborhood currently lives with the construction of the Mass Pike and the Soldier’s Field Road that have disconnected the community from the river,” Johanif said. “Improving connectivity is and should be an important conversation in this project.”
Renee Bourdeau, a civil engineer, discussed the three design options for the project currently under review by MassDOT. The three proposed designs to modify I-90 include either a modified highway viaduct option, a modified at-grade option, or a Soldier’s Field Road hybrid option.
The modified highway viaduct option would include a 10-foot wide section along the Charles River to be used as a pedestrian and bike path. It would also open up 4.5 acres of new parkland.
The modified at-grade option eliminates the current I-90 viaduct to have virtually all traffic level with the surrounding area and contains the pedestrian and bike path as a 20-foot wide boardwalk over the Charles River. This option also adds roughly 3.6 acres of parkland.
The final option — the Soldier’s Field Road hybrid option — would contain a 10-foot wide pedestrian path as well as a separate 10-foot wide bike path. It would also stack Soldier’s Field Road above a four-lane section of I-90. This option would open up 6.1 acres of parkland.
All three options leave the pedestrian and bike path and Soldier’s Field Road vulnerable to predicted flooding in 2050 and 2070, according to Bourdeau. The modified at-grade and SFR hybrid options additionally leave the I-90 open to flooding, she said.
“If you run, bike, walk, or even drive along the river, this is really your time to tell MassDOT what kind of resilient transportation system this area needs,” Johanif said.
MassDOT did not respond to a request for comment.

Harvard Undergraduate Association co-president LyLena D. Estabine ’24 has drawn criticism from some students for her public defense of Harvard College Faith and Action, a Christian campus group that was previously sanctioned for pushing out a leader who was in a same-sex relationship.
Tensions flared on Lowell House’s unmoderated student email list last week when an HCFA leader publicized a group worship meeting. Several students replied to the invitation criticizing HCFA for alleged discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.
Estabine came to the defense of HCFA over the email list, rejecting allegations that the group actively discriminates against LGBTQ+ students. Her email drew backlash, with one student publicly suggesting that she be recalled from the HUA co-presidency.
HCFA’s website says the group “welcomes students from all backgrounds.” But some undergraduates claim the group continues to discriminate against queer students — four years after it was put on a one-year probation by the College for pressuring a female leader to resign after she began dating a woman.
After Lowell resident Sarika Chawla ’23 replied all to the invitation and called HCFA “homophobic,” Estabine, an HCFA student leader, replied all to deny “any kind of discrimination” in the group.
“I personally do not tolerate homophobia or discrimination of any kind,” Estabine wrote in the email. “The bottom line: all are welcome at HCFA Doxa, Bible Course, and all other Events, regardless of their sexual orientation, race, or religious identity. Always. Guaranteed by me and the College.”
In a Saturday email to Lowell residents, the house’s faculty deans, David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser, wrote to affirm “strong support” for both LGBTQ+ students and religious students who practice faith “in ways that are non-discriminatory.” The faculty deans also invited Lowell residents to discuss the email thread at a Saturday meeting.
In a statement to The Crimson, HCFA co-presidents Katherine Wang ’23 and Felix D. Perez Diener ’23 wrote that the organization is “striving to love all people while honoring the Scriptures and our own conscience.”
“We oppose unjust discrimination and hate in all its forms, especially against queer students,” the leaders wrote. “It grieves us that many queer people have experienced hurt from faith communities, and we desire to work toward healing.”
Still, Chawla and other students said Estabine’s defense of the organization poses concerns.
In another reply to the Lowell email chain, Chawla quoted the recall clause of the HUA constitution, which states that an officer can be removed from office following a student petition and vote.
“Someone who is a leader within a homophobic or any sort of discriminatory organization like HCFA, and who continues to defend it and assert that there’s no discrimination present when there clearly is, should not be in such a position of power,” Chawla said in an interview.
Phoebe G. Barr ’24, who criticized HCFA in the Lowell email thread, said in an interview that she was “irritated” by Estabine’s email and that she had been previously warned by an HCFA Bible study leader that theologically HCFA “did not condone homosexuality.”
“It’s one thing to be receiving emails for an organization that I don’t like, and it’s another thing to see somebody telling a lie on the email list,” Barr said. “At that point, I decided I wanted to actually intervene and say, ‘I can personally guarantee that there is homophobia in this organization because I’ve experienced it.’”
Joy C. Ashford ’22-’23, who joined HCFA as a freshman, said they found the organization to be “disingenuous” about its beliefs. The group adheres to a version of Christianity that is “extremely self-destructive to queer people,” Ashford said.
“The fact that we have as our student leader somebody who believes that gay people should be celibate, I think shows just how dysfunctional [the HUA] is,” said Ashford, a former Crimson Arts chair.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Estabine said the HUA “condemns any and all forms of hate” toward LGBTQ+ students on campus.
“I am only one of the nine student officers of the HUA, some of which are themselves members of the LGBTQIA+ community, all of which are working hard to organize and support all students at Harvard College,” Estabine wrote. “I think it is unfair to them and to Harvard College as a whole to conflate my own personal religious sexual framework with the functionality of our new student government, which has been in full effect for less than two weeks.”
HUA co-president Travis A. Johnson ’24 wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he does not think Estabine “has done anything to warrant a recall.”
Johnson wrote that he and Estabine plan to convene a working group to address issues affecting LGBTQ+ students on campus.
“As an organization, we are committed to ensuring that Harvard College is a welcoming and open space for everyone, especially those who come from marginalized backgrounds,” Johnson said.
But Ashford said HCFA — not the HUA — should be the focus of reform.
“I don’t want people to get caught up in the HUA drama and ignore the queer people whose lives are harmed and permanently damaged by some of this toxic theology,” Ashford said.

In the summer of 2017, Lawrence S. Bacow was gearing up to help search for the University’s 29th president, not realizing he would later become a candidate.
Five years later, Harvard is once again embarking on a presidential search — this time for Bacow’s successor.
The announcement that Bacow will step down in June 2023 set off a global operation to find Harvard’s 30th leader. The search will likely involve Harvard faculty, students, and administrators — past and present — as well higher education experts, among others.
During his tenure, Bacow steered Harvard through the Covid-19 pandemic and braved the political headwinds of the Trump administration, at turns lobbying and suing the federal government.
“There is never a good time to leave a job like this one, but now seems right to me,” Bacow wrote in a June email to affiliates announcing his departure.
But as he exits Massachusetts Hall, some challenges remain unresolved.
Harvard awaits a decision from the Supreme Court on a high-stakes affirmative action lawsuit. The University’s development in Allston continues in the face of local resistance, and its commitment to addressing the legacy of slavery on campus is newly underway.
While Bacow’s successor will face distinct trials, past searches have often mirrored each other in timing and process. The searches that produced Neil L. Rudenstine, Lawrence H. Summers, Drew G. Faust, and Bacow himself provide hints about what the hunt for the 30th president will entail. Here’s what you need to know as the search ramps up.
A month after Bacow announced his departure, the University named the search committee charged with finding Harvard’s next leader. Comprised of 15 members, the committee pulls from the University’s top leadership bodies, with 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three from the Board of Overseers.
As the senior fellow of the Corporation — “the first among equals” on Harvard’s most powerful governing body — Chicago billionaire Penny S. Pritzker ’81 will spearhead the presidential search. Bacow, as the outgoing president, will not join the committee seeking his successor, consistent with previous searches.
Not a ton.
The initial stage of a presidential search centers around consulting alumni, students, faculty, staff, donors, and experts, according to former Harvard Provost Harvey V. Fineberg ’67, who was reportedly a presidential candidate in the searches that ultimately selected Summers and Faust.
In July, Pritzker invited Harvard affiliates to submit suggestions and nominations to the committee. Past search committees sent out hundreds of thousands of letters and emails to Harvard affiliates eliciting input and dispatched members across the country to speak to alumni.
“The search committee will formulate and refine its own set of criteria and generate a preliminary list of candidates in conjunction with getting this array of input,” Fineberg wrote in an email.
On Aug. 21, the search committee named 32 affiliates to its faculty and staff advisory committees. The advisory committees are a relatively recent addition to Harvard’s search process, having debuted during the 2006 presidential search following calls for more opportunities for student and faculty involvement.
In past searches, formal and informal nominations from experts and Harvard affiliates have given rise to candidate pools spanning hundreds of names: At the start of the 2006 search that put Faust into office, the committee considered approximately 750 candidates.
Shortlists of a couple dozen candidates historically emerge by winter and are then pared down through intensive interviews. The 2017 committee that would eventually choose Bacow narrowed down its list of names to fewer than 20 by December, consistent with the timelines of the 1990 and 2000 search committees.
Once a list of finalists has been assembled, the search committee members will work to differentiate the strengths of each of the qualified candidates, according to Fineberg.
“Here’s where it can get interesting within a search process because different members of a search committee might put weight on different attributes,” he wrote. “Some will gain insight by talking with those who know and have worked with the candidates or reading what the candidates have written. Others will get the most out of conversation with the candidates themselves.”
After the search committee has selected a final candidate, the 30-member Harvard Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing board — must meet to approve the pick, per the school’s 1650 charter.
Despite the opacity that shrouds the presidential search, long-time observers said they believe the committee will make its final recommendation to the Board of Overseers in January or February of 2023 to ensure a smooth transition at the end of the academic year.
Bacow and Faust were named University president on Feb. 11 of 2018 and 2007, respectively. Summers was confirmed on March 11, 2001, and Rudenstine was selected March 24, 1991.
“I think they’ll want to appoint the new president with a few months before President Bacow steps down, so that there’ll be some overlap,” Harvard donor and former Board of Overseers President Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said.
“Also, they may want somebody who has to quit another job to take this position,” he added. “So they can’t wait until May to tell somebody that he or she’s got to quit what is probably a pretty important job.”
Past search committees have never been explicit about what members were looking for in presidential candidates — likely because searchers do not set out with a clear vision of Harvard’s next leader, according to higher education expert Thomas D. Parker ’64.
While there is no shortage of qualified candidates for the job, Parker said, the difficult task ahead for the committee is “to narrow the criteria about what they’re looking for.”
Still, all of the past four presidents have shared some key characteristics.
Every president in the past 30 years has had a Harvard degree — though none graduated from the College. Before ascending to the presidency, Rudenstine, Summers, Faust, and Bacow all also held other positions at Harvard: Rudenstine and Summers were professors, Faust served as dean of the Radcliffe Institute, and Bacow sat on the Corporation.
The top presidential candidates tend to have an understanding of the University and higher education at large, some track record as an executive or administrator, and academic credentials equivalent to a tenured professor’s, said Harvard professor and education governance expert Richard Chait.
Chait said he believes the ability to qualify for tenure at Harvard is the criterion which “has the greatest effect,” even if it is a restriction “the public at large doesn’t quite appreciate.”
The selection of Harvard’s president requires “a judgment on the part of the search committee that this individual knows enough firsthand about scholarship, research, and teaching to be president of an institution who’s in the business of scholarship, research, and teaching,” Chait said.
Harvard has never been led by a person of color and only one president, Faust, has been a woman. Many alumni say it’s time for that to change.
“I would love to see the University consider diverse voices in picking its new president,” said Coalition for a Diverse Harvard member Joseph J. Barretto ’97, adding that the diversity of alumni has increased in recent years.
Coalition for a Diverse Harvard member Lisa M. Brown ’88 said she hopes the committee takes the interests of a diversifying alumni into consideration when selecting Bacow’s successor.
“As the alumni base shifts, they just have to appeal to at least somewhat different values,” Brown said, in reference to the growing numbers of first generation graduates and graduates of color. “I don’t expect this to happen overnight, but I think it’s at least worth pouting out there now.”
Former Harvard administrators and higher education experts expect a consideration of candidate diversity to feature in the search, but not as a determinative factor.
Fineberg wrote that he anticipates the search committee “will likely be attentive” to candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.
Still, “the committee will not be making any ‘symbolic social statement’ with its decision: it will seek the best candidate for the job, and that person’s sex, race or ethnicity will be whatever it is,” Fineberg wrote.
“The kind of person I want is not the kind of person who wants to lead Harvard,” said Brown, who added that she believes most top candidates intend to preserve the institutional status quo by “following” instead of truly “leading.”
What other criteria might the search committee consider?
One potential job for the 30th president that looms over the search process: running a massive capital campaign.
Since fundraising is a key part of the Harvard presidency, Chait expects the search committee will consider “proven ability” or at least “demonstrable potential to raise money and attract philanthropy.”
“One of the things that a new president always gives you is a new face, and people like that,” he said. “All the major institutions now have to have capital campaigns really at least once every 10 years — and probably more often than that.”
Faust — who launched the University’s last capital campaign in 2013 — helped Harvard raise $9.6 billion, smashing records and surpassing the school’s original goal by more than $3 billion.
Given how the next president will be a personal colleague, the search committee will also consider how well they themselves would work with each of the candidates, according to Fineberg.
Besides searching for a leader with “unquestioned personal integrity, a calm and confident temperament, a capacity to communicate and ability to listen,” the search committee will likely seek out candidates who can serve at least a decade in Massachusetts Hall, Fineberg said.
“Other things equal, it’s an advantage to have that degree of continuity in leadership,” he wrote.
Harvard’s presidential search process is famously opaque. The search committee itself discloses little publicly about its process, an intentional move by the committee that is said to protect the privacy of the process for candidates.
“I don’t think transparency is the highest value for a presidential search,” said Harry R. Lewis ’68, a former dean of Harvard College. “I don’t think you can argue that a transparent process produces better results than a less transparent process.”
Lewis said full disclosure of the search process to the faculty and staff advisory groups would increase the risk of a candidate’s name leaking.
“The problem is that it’s very hard to share much about the list of finalists with a group that large, because it will certainly leak,” he said. “I can’t imagine they’re actually planning to run the list of finalists by those groups and ask for their reaction.”
After he was revealed by The Crimson to be a frontrunner in the 2006 presidential search, former Howard Hughes Medical Institute President Thomas R. Cech bowed out of the race. Cech cited his presidency at the institute and his professorship at the University of Colorado at Boulder as factors in this decision.
“I already have a great job,” Cech said in a phone call to The Crimson confirming his withdrawal.
Full transparency would likely jeopardize the candidacy of high-profile contenders, Lewis added.
“A fully-transparent process, where everybody knows who all the candidates are, will have very quickly a very small pool,” said Lewis, adding that “some of the people you most want to consider will refuse to be considered because they don’t want to deal with the problems that would result at their home institution or the institution that they’re now leading.”
Though outgoing University presidents have traditionally avoided formally participating in the search committee, they have indirectly shaped the criteria for potential candidates.
Former Harvard administrators and higher education experts said search committees seem to keep in mind the legacies of outgoing presidents when selecting the new chief. Both Bacow and Faust, who both avoided high-profile personal controversies during their time in Massachusetts Hall, were likely reactions to the tumultuous tenure of Summers, Parker said.
Entrenched in multiple scandals throughout his term, Summers resigned from his post in February 2006 following a vote of no confidence from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and strained relations with the Harvard Corporation.
“They knew getting into it that Summers could be a difficult personality, but they also knew he had tremendous ability and credentials,” Parker said. “And they said, ‘Okay, let’s go for it. We know there’s a risk here, but let’s do it.’ And that risk didn’t quite work out so well.”
But the caution spurred by Summers’ tenure may have since worn off, Parker said.
“That made them more risk-averse in their next couple of searches,” he said. “That may be over now. They may be willing to think outside the box a little bit more by now.”
Buttenwieser said reservations about a candidate’s political divisiveness may also play less of a role in this search than in previous iterations.
“I suspect that they didn’t want to have somebody who was going to be like a finger in the eye of the right wing,” he said of Bacow’s selection in 2018.
Harvard donor and Blackstone Group Vice Chairman Byron R. Wien ’54 said the committee may have to adopt a “more open-minded” stance and more of “a risk-taking mode” than in previous searches.
“The next president may be somebody from far afield,” he said. “Somebody who has been a president or provost at a university on the West Coast, for example, rather than the East Coast. Somebody they’ve had no contact with previous to the search.”
But Chait said that Harvard tends to maintain a steady course, regardless of who is in Massachusetts Hall.
“If you look at Harvard and its peers, probably what's remarkable is this general degree of consistency in the culture and priorities and character of the University,” he said. “What’s less critical has been the personalities and even styles of the leader.”
“Presidents do move the institution, but they don’t move the institution 180 degrees,” Chait added. “There is a stability and continuity that’s very, very valuable to have.”

Harvard Square is a living, breathing, and ever-evolving organism. Shops, restaurants, and cafes come and go pretty often, and there have been (and will be) some major additions (and losses) to the heart of campus life. If you’re not sure what’s up with all the changes or what to expect in the next few months, here is your guide to what’s new in the Square.
Gong Cha
Long gone are the days when the somewhat perplexing Boston Tea Stop was the only boba place to rule the Square. A popular bubble tea chain but new to the Harvard scene, Gong Cha opened on Church Street this past summer and is already a hit with students. PSA: Flyby will be exploring their boba offerings quite thoroughly for purely scientific research purposes.
Taiyaki… to come!
Ah, yes: Taiyaki AKA Japanese fish-shaped waffle cake with sweet fillings AKA our personal kryptonite. We hope you’re just as excited as we were to hear that the incredibly popular ice cream shop by the same name is finally coming to Cambridge! While opening date details are still murky, definitely keep an eye out for when those delicious, Insta-friendly treats hit the tourist-heavy streets of Harvard.
Harvard Shop #3
R.I.P. beloved Starbucks. Yes, there is Peets, Capital One, Tatte, Darwin’s, and more Dunkin’s than I can count (and another Starbucks by the Quad) to fuel our coffee addictions. Even so, our central, ever-so-convenient Starbucks will be missed. The silver lining is that the new Harvard Shop’s merch is way cuter than any merch at the Coop AND you get a consistent student discount on most items. Do we really need three Harvard Shops in the Square? No. Do I love my new Harvard Shop hoodie? Very much so.
Corporate Jefe’s
While the cozy, homey and somewhat sweaty vibe of the original Jefe’s may be gone, the Square is now home to a giant, two-story, upgraded Jefe’s, complete with lots of indoor seating and standing room (check out Flyby’s full Jefe’s investigation here). The vibes are different and may take some getting used to, but our new late-night meal spot will still fulfill drunken cravings, impress with its fun decor, and definitely feel less cramped as you not-so-patiently wait for your burrito.
Rock-climbing wall
If someone asked me to name 10 things (or maybe 50) that the Square is missing, I can’t say that a rock-climbing wall would be one of them. But, the new rock-climbing wall in F45 Training’s new Brattle Square location, is impressive. You can use their (not-so-generous) one-day free trial option to check it out and flex your climbing knowledge in front of everyone at CVS and Russel House.
Brattle Square Florist 2.0(ish)
Remember all those cute plants everyone got during the first week of classes? You can thank the ever-reliable Brattle Square Florist for those. After a few years of touch-and-go changes, this beloved family establishment has finally settled into their new location on 52 Brattle Street. If you’re scrambling for finishing touches on your dorm ahead of those wintertime sneaky links, you know where to visit first.
So long, &pizza
Controversial list of pros (personal pies and Snackpass immortality) and cons (insanely overpriced and subpar crusts) aside, it seems this Harvard Square staple has finally closed its doors. We can only wonder what will eventually take its place; after all, it's pretty prime real estate right by the Red Line T stop. A laser tag arena? A Mini Bass Pro Shop? A 21+ Rainforest Cafe? Yet another Harvard Sh…?
The Macaron Store?!
Not quite what a college campus needs, but Le Macaron French Pastries’ macarons are delicious and beautiful. There are macarons in flavors including but definitely not limited to chocolate praline, birthday cake, lavender white chocolate, and passion fruit dark chocolate. If you ever want an extra fancy snack or to manifest your next Parisian vacation, this is the spot for you.
Though we’re always talking about popping the Harvard Bubble, don’t forget to also take some time to explore what’s in our own backyard! We promise Lamont and Cabot will always be right there when you return (for better or for worse). See y’all on the 2nd floor of Jefe’s!
