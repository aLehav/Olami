After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Study something you love that you can make a lot of money with,” my mom’s advice echoed as I thought about what options that left. For immigrant families, that often means becoming a doctor or a lawyer. So, I pursued STEM, as I felt I was passionate about it. It would make a lot of money, so that we could have more financially stable futures than my parents did.
I saw my older sister succeed with her Chemistry degree and thought that was the path I would be following. This was the path our parents wanted for us. They came to the United States with us so that we could have more educational opportunities. They could see their success vicariously through us.
But, it took my entire freshman year at Harvard to realize I wasn’t as passionate about STEM as I was about other areas of my life. They were areas that I didn’t yet see having academic potential. I found that I continued in an area I was growing more and more miserable in each day, not only because of what I thought my parents wanted, but also because of the way I heard STEM concentrators invalidate other people’s paths.
The environment was cutthroat, but I stuck through it because I felt I had to. I felt enough imposter syndrome within Chemistry, I could only see it getting worse if I went into the humanities or social sciences. I feared being seen as someone who couldn’t cut it in STEM, even if that wasn’t why I was leaving. I didn’t want another concentration to seem like a backup option.
It wasn’t until I saw the work of seniors outside of STEM, who came from marginalized backgrounds like me, getting validated for their academic achievements that I started to picture other paths of success I had been closed off to. Most importantly, I recognized their passion for their work that I didn’t feel for my own. It is the privilege behind the Harvard degree that gave room for me to feel comfortable leaving STEM with the assumption that Harvard students were set for life.
After exploring various disciplines, I am surprised to see that there are many hierarchical views of concentrations. It’s not just a STEM versus non-STEM binary. I see people competing with lengths of papers, projects, or quality of readings. I see different levels of admiration if you’re doing theory versus studio art. Distinctions still exist within the “hard” versus “soft” sciences. I see condescending views when people do research on communities they are a member of as it is seen as easier and condescendingly labeled “me-search.”
I ultimately ended up in History and Literature and added Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality as my allied field last semester to line up more with my interests. I noticed my own bias as I was surprised by the amount of theory when transitioning with four WGS classes this semester to catch up on tutorials.
It was in my WGS junior tutorial this semester that I also realized most of the class had a joint concentration with WGS. I thought of this as a sign that WGS is not validated as a stand-alone field but after hearing about all the great projects my classmates are doing, I realized the value and need for interdisciplinary work. I recognized the importance of all our concentrations.
We all made it to Harvard. We all worked hard to get here. But I wonder how many of us feel like we have to over-perform how well we are handling things and how much work we are able to get done. With the comparisons of concentrations comes competition over who is doing the most work and who is sleeping the least. It comes with conversations of who will be making the most money after college or over the summer. I hope we can shift the conversation to prioritize ourselves more. I hope we can shift the conversation to pursue what we are most passionate about and not conflate our success as just monetary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For rural communities in the central coast region of California, the name “Harvard” does not connote excellence. For these communities, where water is scarce and becoming scarcer, it evokes greed and exploitation.
As California takes its first steps to regulate groundwater in the midst of a worsening water crisis, Harvard’s endowment fund is investing millions into vineyards that pump inordinate amounts of water from California’s critically overdrafted groundwater basins. According to local farmers, many of whom see their own wells going dry, the University’s projects are doing further damage to the groundwater system as these communities grapple with developing state-mandated groundwater sustainability plans.
Rather than “respectfully engage with the community,” as its own investment guidelines require, Harvard has sent in high-priced consultants to blur water boundaries so that its vineyards can be fully supplied. The University has even fought (and lost) to get out of local requirements to conduct environmental impact studies for its planned reservoirs.
Harvard’s rapacious land and natural resource investment strategies are not unique to California. The University has been grabbing lands from indigenous communities, cutting down forests, and depriving rural people of access to water around the world for years. Brazil is one of Harvard's favorite farmland investment destinations. Over the past decade, the University bought approximately 750,000 acres of land in the Brazilian Cerrado, the world's most biodiverse savannah. Harvard’s farm companies have conducted massive deforestation to plant soybeans and other export commodity crops, which have virtually no benefit for local residents impacted by the destruction. Recent investigations also found that the traditional people occupying much of these lands were displaced by fraud and intimidation.
So how do such investments square with Harvard's stated commitment to go “be a good steward of the land we own and manage?" How can the University claim that its acquisitions comply with its commitments to “ethical conduct, responsible stewardship of the environment, and respect for those with whom we do business?” Read the fine print and you will see there's a hitch; Harvard only responds to environmental and social considerations if they stand to reduce its financial return. In other words, if a move doesn't cost Harvard anything, then it's fair game, no matter what the consequences are for people and the planet.
Harvard refuses to direct its endowment investment arm, the Harvard Management Company, to observe broad moral principles. Even luminary Adam Smith exhorted that capitalism only has merit when directed by ethical mores. Yet HMC’s sole obligation is to maximize profit and grow the endowment as fast as possible within mere legal boundaries. As a direct result, Harvard’s insistence on a financial “first and only” approach to investing has corrupted an otherwise exemplary academic record.
In a December interview focused on divestment from the fossil fuel industry, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said, "The endowment should not be used as a way, as an instrument of social policy...I think there are far more effective ways for us to influence social policy, public policy as well, through our research, our scholarship, through our actions and through our teaching.” In other words, like former University President Drew G. Faust — Bacow’s immediate predecessor — scolded, the endowment should not be used for political purposes. But what is "political" if not the stealing of water rights from local and indigenous peoples and the degrading of our natural commons?
We call upon Bacow, an esteemed economist, to direct N. P. Narvekar, HMC's CEO, to forge a new direction for endowment investments. As the world’s largest university endowment ($39.2 billion in 2018) and with one of the world’s top brain trusts, Harvard has no excuse for such flagrant social irresponsibility. At a minimum, Harvard should consider its own faculty's assessment of the real environmental, cultural, and local impacts of its investments. That view alone would call for divestment from water, land, and energy holdings that are accelerating climate disaster, political chaos, and diasporas. It's time for Harvard to lead, not lag, the growing field of sustainable investing. Investors the world over are watching its every move.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, Charles R. Broderick made history by providing the largest independent donation to Harvard and MIT to fund research on the medical properties of cannabinoids. The $9 million donation comes amidst a groundswell of state-led marijuana decriminalization, much of which centers on the drug’s medicinal uses, and proposes to study its medical and neurobiological effects.
Harvard has hit the green with this donation — as marijuana use becomes more widespread, research in this under-studied field becomes increasingly important. Thus, it should mark the start of broader efforts rather than the culmination of research into the drug’s medical effects.
Thorough, high-quality research into cannabis is long overdue. Ten states have already legalized recreational marijuana use, and 23 have sanctioned its medical use. In light of this widespread availability, such research must better contextualize the benefits and consequences of its use from a medical standpoint. Researchers at MIT and Harvard have already proposed to use this funding for a variety of studies ranging from neurobiology to psychiatry, and we are hopeful that the donation will begin to close this knowledge gap in medical research. In addition to these proposed projects, we hope to see research into long-term health outcomes of regular cannabis users.
In the context of this call for further research, we are acutely aware of the social conditions surrounding marijuana’s legalization, and we believe all research should be grounded in those conditions. Because legal enforcement and decriminalization have predominantly hurt black and brown communities, and resultant social repercussions continue to grip our society, it’s important that marijuana research, medical and otherwise, proceed with this context in mind. Regardless of whether biomedical scientists feel equipped to account for the social contexts of marijuana use in their research, we hope to see additional funding channels open so that sociological research can accompany medical studies.
Marijuana use will continue regardless of local or federal laws surrounding it, so better understanding the long-term effects of daily use can only better help inform health and social policy. This argument also extends to other drugs that are currently criminalized. Research on harder drugs, such as psychedelics, as they relate to health issues, should be viewed as something to aid our society in understanding and dealing with them, rather than as a blanket endorsement of their use.
As obtaining research funding through traditional methods for cannabis research continues to pose a challenge given the drug’s criminalization at the federal level, we hope that other sources, including private donors like Broderick, will continue to fund this important research. While many existing funds are being channeled into research on cannabis’ medical properties, we hope that marijuana’s increased visibility will lead to a diversification of the research surrounding it.
We are glad to see support for this important cannabis research, but we hope future studies can be conducted without reliance upon the money and interest of private individuals. Broderick’s donation has the potential to mark a positive step in marijuana research, but it is important to recognize his connections to the Canadian cannabis industry. Though HMS and MIT have pledged that the donor will have no involvement in the projects, and we believe his donation was given in good faith and are duly appreciative, we generally view research funded by parties with compelling market interest in research outcomes with skepticism. We hope that researchers will remain faithful to this pledge and carry out their research rigorously and impartially with publicly and clearly outlined objectives. We hope this research will catalyze future work that benefits society, informing policies regulating consumption of marijuana.

UPDATED: May 12, 2019 at 9:26 p.m.
The Cambridge Police Department is investigating a report of gunshots fired on Eliot Street near JFK Street at 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning. The incident resulted in one person — a Cambridge resident — injured, according to a citywide alert.
City dispatchers received a call early Sunday morning reporting that shots had been fired in the area and a suspect was fleeing the scene. Responding CPD officers found multiple shell casings on Eliot Street, according to the alert.
The CPD alert, sent to residents subscribed to its email alert system Sunday just after 8 a.m., also stated that prior to the shooting, altercations between two groups took place around Harvard Square.
CPD has not yet made any arrests directly related to the shooting, CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an email to The Crimson. CPD has arrested a 27-year-old male resident of Roxbury — who was involved in the altercation between groups — and charged him with Distribution of a Class D Drug. CPD is investigating his connection to the shooting as a possible witness or involved party, Warnick wrote.
The CPD email indicated that the sole victim was an 18-year old Cambridge resident who sustained non-life threatening injuries and received treatment at a nearby hospital.
No known Harvard affiliates were involved in the shooting, according to Warnick.
Harvard University Police Department Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano forwarded the CPD alert to Harvard affiliates Sunday evening to notify them of the incident.
“HUPD officers were on scene and after consulting with Cambridge Police determined that there was no active threat to the University,” he wrote in his email to students.
Several students living in Kirkland House, which abuts Eliot Street, said Sunday evening that they neither heard the gunshots nor had any knowledge of the incident until they received Catalano’s email.
CPD detectives plan to review video surveillance footage of the surrounding area and speak to any witnesses, according to the alert. They also encouraged anyone with information to reach out to the department.
Correction: May 12, 2019

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. told a Manhattan judge Friday he will no longer represent Harvey Weinstein in his Manhattan sex abuse trial, according to a spokesperson for Weinstein.
Weinstein spokesperson Juda S. Engelmayer wrote that the Hollywood producer is “grateful” for Sullivan’s work on his legal team and noted that Sullivan has offered to advise him as the case moves forward.
“Mr Weinstein is extremely grateful to Ronald Sullivan for his work with him until now, and for Ron's offer to advise where he can going forward. Mr. Sullivan believed that Mr. Weinstein deserved a vigorous defense, and it is a sad moment for us all right now,” Engelmayer wrote.
“We, as a country, have now reached the point when a Harvard lawyer and professor cannot serve his duty to, and belief in, the law and defend a person who may be deemed unpopular or unworthy of a legal defense by segments of the public,” he added.
The announcement came a day before Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to Winthrop residents that he will not renew Sullivan and his wife Stephanie R. Robinson as faculty deans when their term ends on June 30. Since Sullivan announced he would represent Weinstein in January, he has faced a torrent of student calls for administrators to remove him.
ABC News first reported Sullivan’s decision to leave Weinstein’s legal team early Sunday morning. A notice of his decision will be made public Monday, according to their report.
Sullivan did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his decision Sunday afternoon.
Student activists have taken to protests and online posts to criticize Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein. They argued that his representation of Weinstein conflicted with his duties as faculty dean. Last week, 178 students attended a sit-in at Winthrop’s dining hall to “reclaim” the house. Student groups Our Harvard Can Do Better, the Association for Black Harvard Women, and Student Labor Action Movement organized the event.
Though the first calls for Sullivan’s removal came as a result of his decision to represent Weinstein, in the months since students and administrators have argued that his response to criticism and the environment he and Robinson created in Winthrop are also cause for concern.
The Crimson reported on Friday that Sullivan and Robinson’s tenure at Winthrop has been marked by a culture of retaliation and fear, according to a dozen current and former House staff. At one point in their tenure, 13 resident tutors — more than half that year’s tutor staff — made a pact to resign in protest, though they ultimately stayed.
Many students — including Winthrop residents and those involved with student organizations who have been vocal in their calls for Sullivan to step down from his faculty dean position — rejoiced at Khurana’s announcement yesterday after more than three months of campus controversy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview Thursday that the College could alter its admissions policies after an external investigation into Harvard’s head fencing coach, Peter Brand.
The investigation — launched in the wake of allegations that Brand participated in improper real-estate and non-profit transactions with the family of a then-prospective fencer — is still ongoing.
Brand, the head coach of Harvard’s men’s and women’s fencing teams, sold his Needham, Mass. home to iTalk Global Communications, Inc. co-founder Jie Zhao in 2016 for $300,000 above its market value, the Boston Globe first reported last month. Zhao’s younger son, a sophomore and current member of the fencing team, was admitted to Harvard shortly after the transaction; his older son, who was also a fencer, graduated from the College in 2018.
In an email to FAS affiliates last month, Gay announced the University would initiate an “independent review” of the allegations, adding that she is obligated to act with a “sense of urgency” if FAS decides it must strengthen existing admissions and recruitment procedures.
Gay said Thursday she does not know when the investigation will conclude. She added that any potential policy changes that result from the probe would seek to “maintain the integrity” of the “College experience,” specifically the role of athletics. But she added that she would not institute alterations to admissions policies until the conclusion of the investigation.
“Depending on sort of what we learn through the independent review of this particular situation, we'll also see if there are other changes that we need to make to our policies or practices,” Gay said. “I think first, we just need to actually do the review and see what emerges from that, what it suggests about next steps.”
Gay declined to comment on whether Brand would continue to coach the team. As of Sunday night, he is still listed in an internal Harvard directory as the head coach of men’s and women’s fencing, though the team is currently in its offseason.
Asked what firm is heading the investigation into Brand, Gay said she could not recall the name at the moment, adding that it is one the University has worked with previously in situations “where outside counsel or an outside firm is helpful.” FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to name the firm after the interview.
In an interview last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow also said he could not recall which firm Harvard had hired to conduct the investigation but that it was one the University has “retained in other capacities.”
Gay wrote in an April email — echoing Bacow’s remarks in a March interview — that the College’s admissions policies are more robust than other schools’ in preventing the types of impropriety that recently swept up dozens of students, parents, and coaches in a nationwide scandal involving bribes and fraudulent test-taking.
The University announced in April that it planned to conduct training for all of its athletics coaches on its conflict of interest policy. Gay said Thursday that such training is ongoing and largely amounts to “reinforcement” for the athletics staff.
“On a regular basis, the coaches do go through a lot of training, including around things around complicated ventures,” she said. “So it's not as if we're really starting from a blank slate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Within two innings on Saturday, the Crimson had already sent eight players home. One frame later, Harvard held a double-digit margin. Finishing the game 11-1, the Crimson cruised to a playoff series sweep of Columbia, booking a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the second straight season.
“We really wanted to extend our season,” senior catcher Elizabeth Shively said. “Just continue being the strongest team we could possibly be. We clinched the Ivy League title but we also wanted to continue playing and clinch the birth to regionals, which we did.”
In fact, the second game in this best-of-three series was so resoundingly one-sided that it was the first-ever mercy rule game in the history of the Ivy League Championships. Following Friday’s 10-7 win in Game One, Harvard (25-17, 16-5 Ivy) is also now the first team ever to score double-digit runs in multiple games during the playoffs.
“It didn’t matter what we had done the previous game,” Shively said. “Our mentality has always been this season to just focus on what’s on the table that present moment. What really got us to win both those games back to back and sweep was not focusing on past success but focusing on the present moment.”
In the series clincher, Ivy League Pitcher of the Year Katie Duncan proved her value in resounding fashion, tallying her ninth complete game with just one unearned run. Duncan’s season-inning total now stands at 149 frames with a 2.72 ERA, although her pitching demands have in no way ended. Her number will again be called on Friday, May 17 when the Crimson will face the nation’s sixth-best team, Arizona, in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.
“It is super exciting to go to regional,” Shively said. “The returners on the team know that last year’s energy at UGA Regional was incredible and we are definitely looking forward to preparing for it.”
Beyond the mound, Harvard’s offensive production will be of equal importance if it seeks a chance at an upset. Saturday’s game was a display of offensive dominance for the home side, with four Crimson players —  Meagan Lantz, Trina Hoang, Megan Welsh, and Shively  — each reaching base two times. Shively singled to begin the scoring barrage in the first inning, before two doubles added three more runs in that frame. Hoang contributed one of those doubles in a game which saw her lead the squad with three RBI’s.
The Crimson repeated its output in the second inning, catapulted once again by a Hoang two-baser. Harvard tallied two more on the board in the third and one final run in the fifth to guarantee a mercy-rule ending.
Harvard exuded tremendous excitement after Duncan’s final pitch of the game, with the entire bench sprinting towards the field to celebrate. Associate head coach Lacy Wood was doused in water by senior Erin Lockhart before the team posed for their second trophy celebration in the last two weeks. Harvard previously locked up the Ivy League regular season trophy with a 9-1 victory over Cornell on May 6.
“Every single person contributed this weekend,” Shively said. “It was incredible to see so many people get into that second game and I know every single person was on the field this series.”
The opening game in the series was much more of a back-and-forth battle. Duncan earned the nod and lasted three innings, striking out three in the process. A four-run second inning propelled the Crimson to a 6-3 early lead, but the Lions reciprocated with a quadruple-run mark of their own in the third. But an opportune double from Shively in the bottom of the fourth followed by a Hoang RBI rebooted the home side, and a combination of strong pitching from junior Alissa Hiener and a dagger home-run by Welsh secured the game one victory.
“We knew that Columbia was gonna battle really hard,” Shively said. “Our mentality was keep fighting, keep pushing and not let them get any momentum. Every single person was brought in and the energy was incredible from the dugout.”
The Crimson completed its weekend the following afternoon without needing a third contest, and will have a little less than a week for its challenge on the national stage. Many members of this squad reached this stage last season, and are prepared for more. The road forward is not easy, but this Crimson side knows it has more winning than losing in its recent history.
“We need to be super sharp and super focused,” Shively said. “I know I’m excited because hopefully we end up going somewhere new and exciting, playing teams we have never played before. It is a really great experience to represent your conference at regionals and that is what we plan to do.”

If you got all A’s…
Please, please spend that last $10 on self-care by getting a face mask or four (4 for $10 at Urban...though sadly now you’ll have to order them online — rest in peace, Urban). I wouldn’t be surprised if you chose all A’s for no reason other than because they were all A’s. Your money is definitely best spent on stress relief because no matter what you say, the grind really does have to come to a stop sometime.
If you got all B’s…
Since all you clearly seem to be interested in is landing a B-ae, why not just shoot your shot and use your $10 to get J.P. Licks or Berryline for two? I’d act fast — you want to make sure the love of your life doesn’t leave campus before you work up the nerve.
If you got all C’s…
As someone who probably thinks of money in terms of how much food you can buy with it, you probably already know how many McNuggets you can buy with $10. That’s right: What better way to spend your final $10 than on 40 McNuggets?
If you got all D’s…
This quiz was for people who really only had $10 in their bank account. If you aren't in this situation, maybe treat your blockmates to a nice end-of finals dinner so that you aren’t the only one who gets a break from HUDS (hello finals period Uber Eats).
