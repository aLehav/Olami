Reviving the tour of his solo project, lead singer of Vulfpeck, Theo Katzman, played at the House of Blues in Boston on April 28 as a part of the “Be the Wheel” tour. Following the release of the album of the same name in March, Katzman has journeyed from coast to coast with a packed touring schedule.
Katzman took the stage in a candlelit procession. A hat from his new record label Ten Good Songs was perched atop his head, and an unbuttoned flannel revealed his chest. His emblematic clothes, like his music and his record label, declared his belief in the human spirit — an embroidered “I Believe” patch sprawled across the back of the flannel connected to a bright red embroidered heart.
In the darkness before his entrance, a recording of Katzman’s voice read a contemplative meditation on music in an increasingly digital world. The introduction to the show was likewise an introduction to Katzman’s new record label, during which he described the theme behind so many of Katzman’s songs.
“In a time of profound disconnection from nature, truth can be hard to find. But truth lives within us for we ourselves are nature and therefore we are truth. We seek to remind humanity of this truth by capturing the sound of our inborn emotional natural landscape using the processes and principles of high fidelity recording that created the timeless records that we all know and love,” the recorded message said. “Some people might call it old school. We call it, 10 good songs.”
From opening with “Be the Wheel” to an encore display of “That’s the Life,” this message was imbued in the music and highly technical performance displayed onstage. In the middle of “What Did You Mean (When You Said Love),” Katzman called for the music to stop. Someone in the audience had fainted. In perfect unison, and in the middle of a verse, the band ended the song. Fans got silent as the audience member was helped up and out of the crowd.
“That’s what we mean by love” called out someone in the crowd.
Katzman’s message of hope and human connection resonates with many of his fans. While his lyrics may speak of the power of human connection, desire for love, and the perseverance of nature, Katzman proves that he’s not all talk.
“Mostly, we take care of each other. Somebody faints in a concert? We try to see what’s up, we try to solve the problem,” Katzman said, affirming the interpretive comments coming from the crowd.
The transition back into the chorus of “What Did You Mean (When You Said Love)” was an improvised verse about Boston and loving one another. The seamless return to the music was emblematic of Katzman’s casual and lovable charm. Throughout the concert, Katzman spewed lyrical and instrumental improvisation, often at the same time. A signature of Katzman’s musical style, he sings along to his guitar solos, his high range falsetto emulsifying with the whining tone of his electric guitar.
Fans of Katzman’s work with Vulfpeck were ecstatic to see Vulfpeck bassist, Joe Dart, on stage. The chants of “Joe, Joe, Joe” permeated the performance anytime the bassist had a chance to show his chops. The Boston show was a homecoming for Dave Mackay on keyboard and Jordan Rose on drums, two Berklee College of Music alums.
For fans of technical guitar playing, Packy Lundholm may have stolen the show. Enveloping and soulful guitar solos from Lundholm exalted the concert to a level beyond most rock concerts. His solo at the end of “Plain Jane” closed out the show. Bowing to the impeccable shredding, Kazman threw his hat at Lundholm, who put it on without missing a beat.
Another surprisingly popular band member was a stagehand, lovingly called “Mr. Cheeks.” Seemingly popular among Theo Katzman tour fans, a long-bellowed “ch-e-e-e-ks” arose from the crowd anytime Mr. Cheeks came on stage to change Katzman’s guitars. This tradition, passed along to fans through concert videos and social media, is a testament to the community bonds formed around Katzman’s music — Something Katzman would be proud of:
“We were designed to be with each other. We were not designed to be looking at a phone trying to figure out whether we hate this person because they said some stupid stuff,” Katzman said while introducing “The Only Chance We Have.”
Following the final encore, the lights did not go out, nor did house music play to hurry people along. Instead, Katzman jumped down to the barrier to give hugs to fans in the front row and struck up conversations with them. This wasn’t the run of the mill high-five line. Katzman paused for extended conversations and signed shirts, posters, and records. He shook hands and gave hugs. At one point, instead of signing a hat, Katzman traded hats with a fan, giving away the very hat he wore on stage.
Not many artists write music with such a unifying message. Even less embody that message in their business and performance. Theo Katzman is the exception, maintaining a commitment to his message of optimistic human spirit across all of his endeavors.

Harvard and its graduate student union have entered arbitration this month for a grievance filed by the union urging the University to include graduate students from its Department of Human Evolutionary Biology in the union.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, which initially filed the grievance on June 30, 2021, argues that the excluded HEB students perform research that contributes to the work of their principal investigator — and therefore conduct work that would be compensated under the contract.
The group represented by the union includes all students who provide instructional services and who serve as research assistants, “regardless of funding sources, including those compensated through Training Grants,” according to Article 1 of the contract.
Some HEB students receive a stipend, which counts as financial aid, but do not receive compensation. According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, students who are receiving a stipend only for financial aid and are not performing work for the University are not included in the union’s bargaining unit, and performing research for one’s academic work does not amount to providing a service for the University.
In the presence of a mediator, Harvard and the union will conduct arbitration hearings until October 2023, after which the mediator will make a decision about the grievance.
During a May 10 rally in Harvard Yard, union leaders, including then-HGSU-UAW president Koby D. Ljunggren, attended the first arbitration meeting to discuss the inclusion of HEB workers in the bargaining unit.
HEB students first contacted the union’s Contract Enforcement and Education Committee, according to Sal E. Suri, a CEEC member and a third-year Ph.D. candidate in History of Science.
“Despite doing the same work as other student workers in other science departments, they have been told they do not qualify to be in unit,” Suri said at the rally last week.
“These student workers have no access to our benefit funds. They don’t have access to the collective security of our union. In response to this decision by the Harvard administration, CEEC has decided to fight this as much as humanly possible,” Suri said.
Though the grievance was first filed in June 2021, both the University and its union had agreed to extend the timeline of the grievance process.
In March 2023, a National Labor Relations Board official ruled that MIT graduate fellows cannot be included in MIT Graduate Student Union-United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America because fellows receive funding in exchange for their own academic work, not as compensation for work for MIT.
According to Ljunggren, who is set to take on a part-time organizing position with HUWU and Graduate Employees of Northeastern University-United Automobile Workers, “Harvard’s attempts to exclude certain workers from our unit” include denying them the guarantee of a yearly raise.
“Although the University has typically followed through on that promise of yearly raises, if people aren’t covered by the contract, there’s not really much of a guarantee,” they added.

Outgoing Harvard President Lawrence Bacow Earned $1.3 Million in 2021, Financial Disclosures Show
More than 1,600 people have signed a petition calling on Harvard to raise student researcher and teacher salaries up to living wage in Middlesex County for members of the University’s graduate student union by July 1.
On May 10, more than 100 graduate students rallied in Harvard Yard before delivering the petition to Massachusetts Hall. The petition, created by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, began gathering signatures May 1.
According to MIT’s Living Wage Calculator, the living wage for one adult with no children in Middlesex County is $23.45 per hour. Scaled to an annual salary, graduate students would need to make $48,779 to meet the living wage rate.
HGSU-UAW’s petition comes in response to Harvard’s recent decision to name the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, a billionaire hedge fund CEO and Republican megadonor who donated $300 million to Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The petition states that graduate students “are kept in the dark about decisions to sell off parts of our university” and have no input about the use of the funds.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the criticisms levied at the rally and in the petition.
At the rally, organizers argued that the current yearly wage increase of 3 percent does not keep pace with the rising cost of living.
“Harvard has failed to reach that rock bottom standard over and over and over again,” HGSU-UAW organizer Alexandra C. Stanton said at the rally.
Speakers at the rally referenced a flier circulated by Harvard University Health Services encouraging graduate students to attend an informational meeting to “learn more about qualifying for SNAP benefits” as clearly demonstrating the need for higher wages.
“We are united here because the rent is too damn high and it just keeps going up,” HGSU-UAW organizer TomHenry J. Reagan said at the rally. “We are here because the wealthiest academic institution in history thinks it’s okay to tell its employees to go on food stamps.”
Organizers from the Harvard Academic Workers campaign also spoke at the rally. HAW is attempting to unionize non-tenure-track academic workers and has been collecting union authorization cards since February, when they first launched publicly.
“Asking for a living wage is not greedy, it’s not selfish, and it doesn’t undermine that commitment to what you do,” HAW organizer and Harvard Medical School postdoctoral fellow Morgan Gilman said.
“We all know that the money is in the budget. They have no trouble finding the money when they’re writing their own paychecks. This is a matter of priorities,” Gilman added.
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow earned more than $1.3 million in 2021, an increase of around $200,000 from what he made in 2020.
Rallygoers also criticized the University’s acceptance of the donation from Griffin, taking issue with his support of Republican politicians.
Griffin donated nearly $60 million to Republican candidates during the 2022 midterm election cycle and has publicly supported Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024, though DeSantis has not yet announced a presidential bid. Griffin has also contributed to Democratic politicians, including $500,000 to U.S. President Joe Biden’s inaugural committee.
“We’re here because when a billionaire Republican sugar daddy wants to boost his ego, Harvard will happily oblige for a bargaining cost of $300 million,” said Reagan, a first-year Ph.D. student in Engineering Sciences.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has defended the school’s decision to accept Griffin’s donation and rename GSAS in his honor, adding that Harvard should not screen donors for their political affiliations.
The HGSU-UAW petition states Harvard’s decision to accept Griffin’s donation “reinforces a long history of association with the billionaire class and pernicious anti-labor figures.”
The letter criticizes Griffin for opposing teachers’ unions. In a February 2022 interview with billionaire David M. Rubenstein — a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing board — Griffin said he believes an important part of achieving the American Dream is “by having an on-ramp to education.”
“And unfortunately, we’ve put a detour on that on-ramp in many parts of our country where the interest of the public sector unions dominates the rights of the children,” he said.
The petition also condemns Griffin for his support of DeSantis, who it says “has built his national political profile off of ruthless attacks on queer and trans people.” In 2022, DeSantis signed a state law — referred to by many detractors as the “Don’t Say Gay” law — forbidding kindergarten to third-grade public school teachers from teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation. DeSantis has also opposed gender-affirming health care for transgender minors.
In an April 12 statement to The Crimson, Jaquelyn M. Scharnick ’06, a spokesperson for Griffin, wrote that it is “patently false that Ken would in any way support viewpoint restriction as he has been one of the strongest supporters of free speech and free inquiry in the country.”
“Ken said as recently as today that no one who contributes to a politician agrees 100% with their views and policy positions,” wrote Scharnick, a former Crimson News editor. “This is as true for Ken’s financial support of Governor DeSantis as it was for his backing of the campaigns of President Obama and Mayor Rahm Emanuel.”
Per Forbes, Griffin has publicly backed DeSantis’ “Don’t Say Gay” law, saying that DeSantis has “a really important point of view.”
Following the rally, recently elected HGSU-UAW president Evan C. MacKay ’19 led a march around Harvard Yard to deliver the petition to Massachusetts Hall.
“We know that at the richest institution in higher education in the history of the world, Harvard can pay its workers a living wage,” MacKay said.
Correction: May 17, 2023
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly described TomHenry J. Reagan as a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Electrical Engineering. In fact, Reagan is a first-year Ph.D. student in Engineering Sciences
