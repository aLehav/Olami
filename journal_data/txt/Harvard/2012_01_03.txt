After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics Professor Jeremy C. Stein will be nominated to fill one of two vacant spots on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the White House announced on Tuesday.
Stein, whose work has focused mainly on financial regulation, risk management, and monetary policy, has argued for higher regulation for banks, advocating for higher capital standards. President Barack Obama nominated Stein, a Democrat, with Republican Jerome H. “Jay” Powell, who served as a Treasury official under the George H.W. Bush administration.
“Jeremy Stein is a brilliant economist who understands monetary issues extremely well. He will be a great addition to the Board,” Economics professor Philippe Aghion said. “It’s a good manifestation of bipartisanship that shows goodwill on the part of the Obama administration.”
Aghion added that Stein would serve as a strong bipartisan candidate, maintaining a core Democratic set of ideals but retaining the “trust” of Republican figures.
“He is an uncontroversial figure,” Aghion said.
At Harvard, Stein teaches a series of finance courses, earning sky-high Q Guide ratings. Before coming to Harvard in 2000, he taught at the MIT Sloan School of Management for ten years. He has also taught as an assistant professor of finance at the Harvard Business School from 1987 to 1990.
Though Stein has primarily served as a researcher and policy scholar, he worked with the Obama Administration from February to July of 2009 as an adviser to the Treasury Department and was on the staff of the National Economic Council. Stein, who earned his PhD from M.I.T. in 1986, has also served on the board of the American Finance Association and acted as an advisor for the Federal Reserve of New York since 2006.
If the Senate confirms Stein as a governor to the Federal Reserve Board, he will serve a term that will expire in 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The newest round of AP and Coaches polls are out, and the Harvard men now sit at 22 in the AP and 21 in the Coaches. The Crimson climbed two positions in both polls since last week's voting.
As Harvard continues to claw its way up in the polls, a Crimson fever has begun to sweep across the country. Even in my hometown, all the way across the country in Washington State, a few people have chosen to pay a complement to our basketball team, rather than making a nerd joke, when they spot my Harvard t-shirt.
Speculation about what this team is capable of is filling sports columns all through the Northeast and the internet is abound with calculations trying to figure out how far the Crimson can go. As early as November, The Daily Pennsylvanian was discussing whether the 2011-2012 team might be the best in Ivy League history. The discussion opened up Tommy Amaker’s star squad to intense comparisons to the Penn 1979 Final Four team, and other Ivy League success stories. The verdict? Still open, and it seems like it will mostly depend on what Harvard can do this season, a question that is already being put run through mathematical simulations.
Big Apple Buckets ran 10,000 simulations trying to determine how Ivy League play will go this season. In their calculations Harvard won the title outright 8,756 times and at least shared it 9,508 times. Their closest competitor was Princeton, who only won 177 outright titles out of the 10,000 trials.
And even these odds aren’t good enough for some Crimson fans, one fan tweeted that the odds should be reexamined through the Bayesian method to account for their consistency. He claimed that when this simulation was run, Harvard won outright in 97-98% of the trials and at least shared the title 99.8% of the time.
But this is the type of question that cannot be answered definitively through mathematics beforehand. And Crimson fans are just going to have to wait for January 7th when Harvard opens Ivy play by welcoming Dartmouth to Lavietes Pavilion, where they are on a 21 game winning streak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BRONX, N.Y.—Faced with a stifiling Fordham zone defense that limited the efficiency of its two All-Ivy big men, an untimely combination of off-nights from its best long-distance shooters, and a raucous, hungry home crowd at Rose Hill Gymnasium, the No. 21/22 Harvard men’s basketball team learned quickly Tuesday night the difficulties of playing on the road with a target on its back.
And in being upset, 60-54, by the Rams (7-6) in a defeat that will likely knock it out of the national rankings for the second time this season, the Crimson (12-2) also learned it has a lot to work on before opening Ivy play versus Dartmouth Saturday.
“We came out real flat,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “Fordham played really well in their home gym, the crowd got behind them, and they kind of punched us in the mouth to begin with, and we couldn’t get back in it. We made some runs, but I think they had too much momentum, and they played well and some of their guys hit big shots and we didn’t.”
Harvard had trouble throughout the evening against Fordham’s three-quarter court press that evolved into a 2-3 zone. With co-captain Keith Wright and junior Kyle Casey consistently struggling to get position inside, the squad was forced to rely on the three-point shot far more than it would have liked.
“We certainly were ready for [the zone],” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “It didn’t look like it, obviously, but we didn’t see anything different than they were performing on film and what we were preparing for.”
A strong defensive performance of its own kept the Crimson in the game. But it was Fordham that knocked down the big shots late in the contest, while Harvard was just 8-for-30 from behind the arc, including a combined 1-for-13 from its two normally most-prolific three-point shooters, sophomore guard Laurent Rivard and junior wing Christian Webster.
“Our shooting percentages were horrific,” Amaker said. “Certainly they had a lot to do with it, how active they were defensively, how aggressive they were closing out to our shooters. … They played an inspired game, their kids were tremendous throughout the 40 minutes. They deserved to win.”
Despite its struggles, Harvard still had the chance to avoid the upset in the end, even after falling behind by 10 midway through the second half. McNally drilled a game-tying three to make it 50-50 with 3:28 to go, but from there, the Crimson was unable to pull ahead.
Junior guard Brandyn Curry missed a jumper on Harvard’s next possession, while Rivard and McNally failed to knock down threes in the Crimson’s subsequent two times down the floor. Meanwhile, Fordham was able to get to the line twice, and a pair of free throws by Branden Frazier put the Rams up, 53-50, with 1:40 remaining.
On Harvard’s next possession, Wright grabbed an offensive rebound off a Curry miss and was fouled. The senior hit one of two from the line to cut the deficit to two and give him exactly 1,000 points in his Crimson career. But Fordham’s Bryan Smith responded with a three from the left corner that gave the Rams a five-point lead with 37 seconds left.
Curry missed a desperation long ball at the other end, and Smith hit two free throws as the consistently energetic crowd began to sense victory—Fordham’s first home win over a ranked team since 1978—and started serenading the Crimson with chants of “Overrated.”
Curry—who led the squad with 15 points—hit a three-pointer on Harvard’s next possession to cut the Rams lead to four, but it was all too little too late for the Crimson, which—after falling behind late to Florida Atlantic and Saint Joseph’s in recent weeks—did not have another comeback left in it.
“We’ve become a ranked team and it’s a home game, and I think people still look at us—and rightly so—as a winnable game,” Amaker said. “That’s a fair statement, I think. We’re not going to intimidate people when we walk on the floor; we have to execute and perform. I thought their team played and momentum built, confidence was growing, and it didn’t happen for us.”
Harvard led, 27-24, at the half, and Casey opened the second with a put-back layup of a Webster missed three. But Fordham center Chris Gaston—who added to his league-high total of 11 double-doubles with 18 points and 10 rebounds—responded with a three-point play, and Smith drilled a three on the Rams’ next possession to give Fordham its first lead since 8:15 in the first half.
Casey responded with at long ball of his own, but from there, the Crimson began to lose its composure and turned the ball on five of its next ten possessions as the Rams pulled ahead.
A Smith three and eight Gaston points sparked an 11-0 run that put Fordham up, 44-34, with 12:19 to go.
“In zones, you’re going to get open shots, and we didn’t hit them,” McNally said. “We got a lot of shots and we didn’t hit anything. And we threw the ball away and that was pretty much it. …  You’ve got to give a lot of credit to Fordham; they played hard, they’re tough kids, but we’ve got to do a lot better.”
Curry hit a long ball to cut the deficit to seven, and Harvard responded with a run of its own to get within 46-43 on a McNally trey. But Smith responded with another big three, and the Crimson was never able to get closer than the 7-1 run that placed it in a 50-50 tie. The Rams pulled away and ended the game with a celebration fit for a national title, throwing the ball in the air and mobbing each other near midcourt.
“It’s a good feeling,” said Smith, who finished with a game-high 22. “History was made.”
“I’m happy,” Gaston added. “It’s a great win for the program. … I’ve never been a part of something like this.”
Harvard shot just 36 percent from the field and just 50 percent from the free-throw line on the night—a far cry from its 23-point victory over Fordham at Lavietes Pavilion last season, when it was 15-of-27 (including 8-of-14 from Webster and Rivard) from long distance.
“Basketball’s a funny game and a funny sport,” Amaker said. “Now we have to go back to work and see if we can get better this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team kicked off 2012 in winning fashion on Tuesday, routing regional foe UMass, 68-47, at the Mullins Center in Amherst, Mass. Behind strong guard play and stingy defense against the Minutewomen (5-10), the Crimson (6-6) proved that it will be a force to be reckoned with down the stretch this season.
“It was our best game so far this year,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We did  a great job preparing for the game and playing as a team. We stuck to the scout and were consistent all four quarters.”
The Crimson began Tuesday’s contest hot from three-point range. Four Harvard starters converted from behind the arc to give the squad an early eight-point lead, 12-4. Though this streak didn’t continue, Harvard’s three-point shooting was far better than its season average of 28.7 percent—the team finished the contest making 45 percent of its shots from downtown.
“As individuals, we’ve all gone into the gym and taken advantage of the extra time we’ve had [on campus,]” sophomore guard Christine Clark said. “I think that translated into us making our threes [against UMass.]”
Sophomore guard Missy Mullins provided the Crimson with a spark off the bench in the first half, substituting in to score a quick six points on 3-of-3 shooting. The play of Mullins and the Harvard bench helped create separation in Tuesday’s contest. Harvard’s bench chipped in 21 points, while the Minutewomen’s reserves failed to reach double-digits, contributing a mere seven points.
“Players like [Mullins], [sophomore center Elise Gordon], and everyone that came off the bench came in and had a really strong defensive presence,” Clark said. “Our team fed off of their defensive stops.”
With 5:10 left in the first half, Harvard found itself on top, 21-12. Following a layup by sophomore center Elise Gordon, the Crimson closed out the half on an 18-3 run and never looked back.
Harvard co-captain Brogan Berry had a double-double against UMass, adding 10 assists to her 12 points. Sophomore guard Christine Clark and junior forward Emma Golen also scored double-digits, contributing 13 and 10 points, respectively.
“I was surprised that it was [Berry’s] first career double-double,” Clark said. “Coming out as a senior, she’s been playing tremendously well. I’m really happy that she was able to get her first career double-double, and the fact that we won makes it even better."
“[Berry] knows it’s her senior year,” Delaney-Smith added. “She’s stepping up and being a leader. She’s done that all year for us.”
Clark and junior forward Emma Golen also scored double-digits, contributing 13 and 10 points, respectively.
To kick off the second half, Golen and junior forward Victoria Lippert drained a pair of three-pointers to put Harvard up, 45-19. Buckets by Golen and Gordon gave the squad a 30-point lead, and co-captain Lindsay Louie put the Crimson on top by 32 points—its biggest lead of the game—with 6:10 remaining on the clock. 
UMass cut the Harvard lead to 23 by putting together a 9-0 run with just over three minutes to play, but it was too little too late; the Crimson’s lead proved to be insurmountable. 
Harvard’s balanced scoring stood in stark contrast with that of its regional rival, which was led by forward Shakia Robinson’s game-high 17 points and the 15 of center Jasmine Watson. Aside from the Minutewomen’s starting frontcourt, no UMass player chalked up more than five points.
“It’s surprising because UMass is more talented than some teams that we’ve lost to,” Delany-Smith said. “They have two forwards who are terrific and some guards who can really shoot the lights out. We locked them down. It wasn’t a one-on-one thing, it was an complete team effort.”
The Crimson defense held its opponent to under 50 points for the first time this season. Harvard tallied nine steals in the game, including three from Berry, and forced the Minutewomen to shoot 2-of-21 from behind the arc.
“As a team, we came in really focused on [UMass’] tendencies and what we had to do in order to have success,” Clark said. “Our defense was key.”
“Defense. Everything about [Tuesday’s] game was defense,” Delany-Smith added.

New year, new opponent, same result for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team, as it started 2012 on the right note—eight times over.
The Crimson (9-4-0, 1-0-0 Ivy) looked to push its win streak to four as it traveled to UConn (3-12-4) Tuesday night. Harvard controlled the tempo from start to finish and ultimately won the game, 8-1. The eight Crimson goals scored Tuesday marked only the third time in the last five seasons that Harvard has scored eight-plus times in one game.
“I think the game went really well,” freshman forward Hillary Crowe said. “You could tell we were all ready to get back on the ice and finally play together. We had a tough week of practice, and so we were all really excited for this game. We were definitely happy with how we played.”
The scoring barrage began at the 9:09 mark in the first period after sophomore forward Gina McDonald received a quick pass from junior forward Kaitlin Spurling. McDonald wasted no time in netting the goal from the right side of the ice.
Less than four minutes later, Spurling sprinted down the ice once again, leaving the puck to the trailing Crowe. Crowe attempted a shot, but it was blocked by Connecticut goalie Nicole Pannicia. Sophomore forward Kalley Armstrong nabbed the rebound and immediately sent the puck back and into the goal for a 2-0 Crimson lead.
With 5:47 left in the first, sophomore Lyndsey Fry followed in her classmates’ footsteps,  advancing the lead to 3-0 with a shot from short range.
In the second period, Harvard continued its dominance, as Spurling found the back of the net, marking the first time this season she has recorded both an assist and a goal in a game.
“McDonald made a tight spin move, dropped the puck to Armstrong, who came up around the dot,” Spurling said. “I’ve been practicing coming down, getting close to the net, and having her find me. I just happened to be open, she fed me, and I just put it home. It was great to finally get that to work in a game.”
At the 6:50 mark of the same period, Connecticut’s Kayla Campero put in a goal for the home team. This would prove to be the only scratch on the scoreboard for UConn.
Junior forward Jillian Dempsey continued the Crimson’s offensive onslaught as she scored following a pass from freshman forward Samantha Reber.
After 17:58 of the second period had elapsed, freshman forward Hillary Crowe notched the third goal of her career.
“I was off to the side of the net, and I saw Dempsey passing it up to the point,” Crowe said. “I could tell [freshman defender Michelle] Picard was going to take a shot, so I moved to the front of the net. I wasn’t quite there though, so I stuck my stick out and it deflected into the net.”
Only thirty seconds later Fry put in her second goal of the night, marking her second multi-goal game of the season.
To cap off the night, McDonald added another goal to her tally, making her the second Harvard player with two goals on the night. McDonald received the puck from Fry—the teammate who also finished with multuple scores.
Many players attributed the night’s offensive successes to the close-knit nature of their line mates.
“I did pretty well, but overall, it was the team effort that really helped,” Spurling said. “My line, McDonald and Armstrong, did a great job. We’ve been clicking in practice, saying that this is our time and that we wanted to have a good start to the 2012 season. We played really well together tonight, and it was awesome to put some points up on the board to help the team out.”
Armstrong seconded Spurling’s thoughts, stressing the line’s emphasis on strong, assertive play.
“My line, our goal for the season has been to perform well offensively,” Armstrong explained. “We all tend to be pretty unselfish players, so I think we’re trying to work on not being afraid to shoot and put it away. It turned out well.”
To go along with the outburst on the offensive end, junior goalkeeper Laura Bellamy had 20 saves on the night.
“We came back from winter break and had three days of doubles to get our legs under us,” Spurling said. “It really brought us closer as a team. We wanted this opportunity to get pumped, and take all that energy, the dynamic that we gathered from that atmosphere, and use that positively. For the rest of the season, we’re going to play it goal by goal, day by day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BRONX, N.Y.—Entering Tuesday night’s matchup between the No. 21/22 Harvard men’s basketball team and Fordham, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that co-captain Keith Wright would notch the eight points he needed to reach 1,000 for his career.
After all, Wright, who had scored in double figures in 35 of the Crimson’s past 43 games heading into Thursday night, was set to face a Fordham defense that isn’t exactly know for its stinginess.
And early on, it looked as if Wright was well on his way to becoming just the 27th player in program history to join the 1,000-point club.
With 2:48 to play in the first half, Wright scored his fifth and sixth points of the game, finishing a layup off a Brandyn Curry pass to put Harvard ahead by six. Then, just seconds before the end of the first half, Wright was fed in the post again. He made a move toward the basket and tossed a shot at the rim as he was fouled, but the ball went in and out, and the senior was forced to earn his points at the line.
Wright sunk the first, but his second attempt missed, and he went into the locker room one point shy of 1,000.
It took him 18 minutes and 56 seconds to pick up that final point.
After going 3-for-3 from the field in the first half, Wright did not register a shot attempt in the entire second period and finished the game with three shots, a season-low. It was not until a late free throw that Wright picked up his eighth—and final—point of the night.
“They were playing zone, so part of that is it’s tough to get the ball inside,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He could have taken more shots than three. It’s not just about us getting him the ball. We’ve got to be able to see if there are ways that he can get it off the backboard or get to the foul line.”
Getting Wright going offensively has been key to the Crimson’s success. So far this season, Harvard is 8-0 when the co-captain reaches double figures. When he is held to under 10 points, the Crimson is 4-2.
DRY SPELL
Amaker often remarks that the Crimson’s offensive strength lies in its ability to play inside-out. If opponents focus too much on defending Wright in the post, Harvard can swing it to an open shooter on the perimeter. And if opponents extend their defense to get out on the Crimson’s shooters, Harvard can dump it out down to Wright and let the big man go to work.
On most nights, if one half of the Harvard offense is faltering, the other half picks up the slack. That wasn’t the case Thursday.
While Wright was ineffective against a tough Fordham zone defense, the Crimson’s shooters had even greater struggles, as the team went 20-of-55 from the field and 8-of-30 from beyond the arc.
“Certainly our shooting percentage was horrific,” said Amaker, whose team had its worst shooting performance since playing Florida State in November. “No matter what you do, if you can’t throw it in the ocean sitting out on the row boat, it’s not going to look like you're prepared for anything.”
Despite taking a season-high 30 three-point attempts—nearly double its average of 17.8 attempts per game—the Crimson was not unhappy with its shot selection.
“We got a lot of open shots,” co-captain Oliver McNally said. “I don’t think that we were jacking or anything like that. It didn’t have that feel to it.”
Fordham coach Tom Pecora felt the Rams caught a break with the Crimson’s off shooting night.
“[Laurent] Rivard’s just a tremendous shooter,” said Pecora of the Harvard sophomore, who went 1-of-8 from deep. “We got lucky the way he shot tonight.”
But Amaker noted that it was more than luck that accounted for the Crimson’s shooting woes.
“Certainly [Fordham] had a lot to do with it—how active they were defensively and how aggressive they were closing out on our shooters,” he said. “I’d like to think that we will shoot better at some point as we’ve done in the past, but give them credit.”
OUT OF LUCK
Before Thursday night’s matchup, the Crimson had taken care of business when it was supposed to, winning all of the games it was favored in and dropping just one contest to then-No. 9 UConn. Even so, it seemed as though Harvard’s luck was starting to run out.
Taking on a mediocre Florida Atlantic squad on Dec. 22, the Crimson trailed the Owls by two with 10:03 to play before eventually winning by 12. Playing a Boston College team picked to finish dead last in the ACC on Dec. 29, Harvard fell behind by 11, 14-3, less than six minutes in before storming back to win by 21. And then against a talented Saint Joseph’s squad on Dec. 31, Harvard came back from an 11-point second-half deficit to capture a five-point win.
“We were concerned coming in,”  Amaker said. “We talked about how getting off to a better start would hopefully allow us to get in a flow. It didn’t necessarily go that way for us here tonight.
McNally echoed his coach’s sentiments.
“We got lucky in a couple games,” he said. “We can’t be living like that. We used to be a team that got a lot of quick starts, and we haven’t been doing that. We’ve got to get back to finding whatever that was.”
