After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind,” H.P. Lovecraft writes in his 1929 short story, “The Dunwich Horror.” Lovecraft’s fiction evokes an eerie, neo-Gothic closeness to the natural world while alternately imagining the farthest reaches of believability, the macabre ideas to be found “outside the sane experience of mankind.”
It was surely this delicate balance that Caroline Kepnes, veteran entertainment journalist and author of thrillers like “Hidden Bodies” and “You,” intended to invoke with her latest novel, “Providence.” Yet Kepnes’s novel, which is inspired by and often directly alludes to “The Dunwich Horror,” comes as an ersatz replication of Lovecraft’s delicately wrought horror fiction.
Indeed, Lovecraft—father of all things macabre, freakish, otherworldly—would likely be alarmed at the idea of inspiring a work of fiction as banal as “Providence.” Situated at the intersection of Lovecraftian supernatural thriller and detective noir, the novel is the kind of popular book written to entice a Hollywood producer into greenlighting a film adaptation—the promise of CGI special effects laced into every chapter. Think many distracting bells and whistles, few moments of actual substance.
And who knows? The blockbuster ploy just might be successful, but the novel itself as a work of fiction reads unintelligently. Chloe Sayers and Jon Bronson, two New Hampshire teenagers, build an unlikely friendship. She is the popular girl, he is the middle school outcast, and while Chloe’s friends court boys at pool parties, those same boys bully Jon into taking a different route to school. One morning, Jon mysteriously disappears, launching a community-wide search. Four years later, he awakens from a medically induced coma in the basement of a mall, suddenly brawny and handsome, and with a strange, uncontrollable ability to induce heart attacks in other people—the result of genetic manipulation by his kidnapper. After the first of these traumatic incidents, Jon goes on the run while Chloe grows up, even going through an emo phase, in the wake of his destruction. Some years later, with Jon using his power to pick off local drug dealers and Chloe balancing her career as an artist and loveless engagement with her stock-trader fiancé, an aging detective named Charles “Eggs” DeBenedictus begins to unpack the shady underpinnings of the unexplained deaths.
“Providence” sustains enough energy to keep a casual reader interested, and it may be satisfactory enough as an anesthetizing beach read. It begins with an interesting enough set-up—boy meets girl, boy vanishes and re-emerges with superpowers—but Kepnes loses track of the introduction’s propulsive energy and lets it strangle the life from the narrative. The next couple hundred pages are listless and scatterbrained, the once-innovative conceit growing as limp and lifeless as one of Jon’s heart attack victims.
Narrated in turns by Chloe, Jon, and Eggs in alternatingly halting, inelegant prose, the pages of “Providence” are populated by melodramatic characters with inert inner lives. Chloe and Jon seem to be in constant pursuit of each other, but while Jon uses his time to determine the scope of his powers and wield them in vigilante-style killings of local druggies, Chloe vacillates emotionally between pining for Jon and resigning herself to a life of financial security with her fiancé Carrig—which hardly makes sense, given the dearth of emotional backstory for either relationship. Chloe imagines her life through romantic platitudes: “I love Jon. I want [Carrig]. My heart must be bigger than normal,” she thinks, and later, “Carrig’s love is sealing the crack in my heart that Jon made.” Until the last few pages, her character development rarely turns inward, addressing her own emotional turmoil; instead, her arc is male-oriented. It’s nice enough that Kepnes chooses to inhabit a female consciousness, but Chloe’s inner life hardly passes the Bechdel test. Meanwhile, Jon’s sections of the book are intriguing, but lack the rich, inner emotional potential that they could have had, instead reading like a play-by-play of a thriller screenplay. Only Eggs’ chapters are slightly redeemable, in which Kepnes dissects the machinery of an adequate marriage and the estranged parenting of a mentally handicapped child. Eggs’ life is painful, complex, interesting; if only it occupied more than a third of the novel.
But even the force of Eggs’ arc is blunted. Perhaps the biggest narrative crime is Kepnes’ decision to prematurely supply the “who” along with the whodunit. Just before Jon loses consciousness, he identifies his kidnapper (and the man responsible for his genetic transformation), and with that, any narrative suspense is murdered in cold blood, leaving the detective to “solve” a case the solution to which Kepnes has already made known. Eggs is less solving a case, and more retracing the steps that the reader has already walked.
The only question keeping “Providence” from petering out after the first 50 pages, then, is how Jon’s powers came to be and how they can be reversed. But Kepnes dances timidly around these inquiries, offering instead the cameos of a few doctors who supply vague answers: “A tree doesn’t just randomly grow tall, with one central branch,” one of them, Dr. Meeney, says cryptically. “The central branch fights the others to become what it is. Nothing is arbitrary about power.” The bridge between the pseudo-scientific and the thematic is weakly forged, and there’s no attempt at the specifics that would enrich this science fiction, not even a handwavy one. Even in the book’s final pages, Kepnes skirts a crucial plot resolution and performs the literary equivalent of a shrug: “Medicine is an approximate science.” So too, it seems, is fiction.

As digital imaging has advanced, cookbooks have become overwhelmed with images rather than recipes or essays. Because of this, they have been relegated to the task of eye candy—becoming the kinds of things we flip through in the kitchen aimlessly like magazines when we are bored.
Yet to do this with Jeremiah Tower’s new cookbook “Flavors of Taste,” would surely be a waste. While Tower has included many colorful images of sumptuous dishes and ingredients, to simply flip through his book would be to miss out on the countless stories of heritage and discovery that accompany each set of instructions.
All of the personal essays featured throughout the book are a testament to Tower’s posh upbringing, rebellious youth, and streamlined career. The recipes themselves are equally rich with earnest anecdotes about his travels as they are with butter. A flurry of stories about work at famed Berkeley restaurant “Chez Panisse” with Alice Waters as well as his later work at his own flashy San Francisco restaurant “Stars” are peppered across the pages.
As Tower himself acknowledges, the recipes are a testament to his peripatetic lifestyle and the conglomeration of cuisines he has encountered and experimented with—particularly those French and Californian flavors. The recipes themselves prove to be a mix of the most basic but delicious comfort foods and more complex regional favorites. The first chapter begins with a simple rib roast and an individual sized pizza, but then quickly heats up with a rich, complicated yet timeless bouillabaisse and a sea urchin soufflé. Essentials like eggs get ramped up in a recipe for the most luscious and creamy French-style scramble topped with shaved black truffle.
Classics like steak au poivre are accompanied by hearty side dish recommendations. Each of these is carefully selected. The fries that accompany the steak are not simply potatoes, they are the perfect 3/8 inch French fries cooked in rendered beef kidney suet. There are also more unusual ingredients like the black chile paste which Tower makes in his home in Yucatan.
The beauty of the recipes is that they are both simplistic and effectively communicated, always imbedded with the intermittent tip or trick. A fallen soufflé can be scooped into a buttered gratin dish topped with cream and briefly broiled to become your grandmother’s pudding. Tower tackles even more difficult ground by giving the low down on intimidating ingredients such as black truffles, allowing for his more advanced recipes to become less daunting for the average cook.

Tower digs into family recipes and history for inspiration, pulling from delicate menus sourced from relatives aboard the Titanic and menus from glamourous hotels like the Ritz-Carlton in London, which his grandfather frequented in the early 20th century. There are also records of Tower’s favorite meals over the years and across the world, including an exquisite plate of sirloin of lamb in New South Wales and Kobe beef Shabu-shabu in Japan which served as inspiration for his own restaurant.
Even Tower’s descriptions of these meals are enough to excite the palate. Sometimes they even border on the poetical. A bowl of truffle soup is not simply a grey colored pot of cream—it is a puree the “color of a Paris winter sky threatening to storm.” Complicated cooking techniques are broken down and explained in the most erudite but simple manner—in fact, Tower’s attention to detail presents a book that almost borders on an encyclopedia.
With its crisp recipes, decadence, and copious amounts of research, “Flavors of Taste” will ensure both success in the kitchen and satisfaction to those eating their way through its recipes. It will also provide much needed inspiration and color on those afternoons and nights when you want to simply treat yourself with the finest flavors. If you can, go ahead and pour yourself an ice cold tulip of champagne—Jeremiah Tower would approve.

Opening a festival like Lollapalooza is no easy task. Some performers rely on the tried-and-true, letting their discography and loyal fanbase do the talking. Others feed off of the crowd’s unique energy, egging impassioned listeners on and tossing in quips between songs. Perhaps the most ambitious musicians are the ones who, faced with rigid timeslots and vagabond audiences, decide to try their hand at storytelling. Nestled in the shaded isolation of the American Eagle stage, indie pop musician Allie X ushered in this year’s festival with a performance that was equal parts perplexing and captivating.
Sporting a costume resting somewhere between kitsch and fashion, Allie X transfixed viewers the moment she stepped onto the stage. Her face replaced by a grotesquely designed veil-mask—complete with wide eyes, parted lips, and clenched teeth—the musician stoked a sort of disconnect with her audience right from the beginning. Whereas other performers might introduce themselves before moving forward, she offered no explanation for her unconventional appearance. Launching directly into her set by vocally punching out the notes of her opening number “Bitch,” Allie X set the tone for what would be an incredibly theatrical, albeit unorthodox show. Gingerly tiptoeing around in the summer heat, the artist appeared not unlike a marionette, compelled by forces unrevealed to the viewer.
The payoff for this non-sequitur-turned-entrance was rewarding as the confusion of the first few songs gave rise to more comprehensible imagery soon after. The interspersing of newer songs such as “Science” among her well-known earlier pieces—“Paper Love” and the particularly danceable “Casanova” elicited a buzz of excitement among those gathered to listen. As if unleashed, with an increased mobility mirroring the energy of these uptempo hits, the artist began to move more readily along the stage. Her wind-up toy-like movements were supplanted by fluid and repeated twirls, much to the delight of her audience. She began to intimately engage with the crowd, at one point even dedicating a song to those enjoying her set.
Quite miraculously, the copious theatrical elements during the show never took away from the music. Allie X, though no stranger to heavy production, absolutely holds her own vocally. The high notes of her songs’ bridges were deftly executed, confidently belted rather than breathy. One gets the sense that, had she stripped away all of the extraneous elements on a whim, Allie X could have delivered a perfectly respectable acoustic version of her set.
That said, far from being distracting gimmicks, the additions helped elevate the performance. Her image was instantaneously striking, a fitting counterpart to her crisp and at times haunting instrumentals. Her shifting stage persona, intriguing yet unpredictable, seemed to invite spectators to remain vigilant and keep them at rapt attention. It was fitting that the screen behind her projected her live video rather than visuals, as though it beseeched its viewers to focus their attentions onstage.
Tucked away among the trees of American Eagle, Allie X kicked off the festival’s first day with a performance in the purest sense of the word. Bulwarked by her beautiful timbre, the artist made a conscious effort to create an engrossing experience for festivalgoers, and it paid off. Listeners looking for an immersive pop experience should keep their eyes out for Allie X: There’s no telling what her next set might look like, but there’s no doubt it’ll be worth your while.

Panorama 2018 has been marred by technical difficulties, but the performance of Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane (also known as Guwop) was a glimmering light in the bleakness of the abyss. While the festival is well-designed in terms of layout and amenities, it has also been plagued with cancellations by most of the major rap/hip-hop artists scheduled to perform, due to various downstream effects of Friday’s storm. Without the company of any member of Migos, The Weeknd, or Saturday headliner Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane remained the only big name rapper of Panorama 2018. All of this is to say that during Gucci Mane’s set, the last big rap performance of the festival, expectations were high and the anticipation was palpable.

After waiting for the set to begin, DJ Champ came onstage introducing himself as “Guwop’s official DJ.” Champ played the hype-man for about half an hour. He incessantly challenged the audience to play his own version of Simon Says, which he began with: “If you’re ready for Guwop…” before having the audience “put your hands in the air,” “make some noise,” “put your right foot in,” and “shake it all about.” The whole process felt like a contrived attempt at stalling, perhaps until festival organizers could sort out some of the technical issues with the sound. Shortly after one such game, all of the power cut out briefly on stage. Like an outraged English butler, DJ Champ remarked, “We can’t be having that with Guwop now,” before he stormed away from his DJ stand.

After five minutes of darkness and relative quiet, DJ Champ returned with his indignation subsided. He came back to do another 15 minutes of mediocre DJ-ing by playing other people's songs and taking brief breaks to shout things when the song was manually stopped—but at least he came back. As mediocre of a DJ as he was, he was at least better than silence. At long last, DJ Champ bellowed the final, “Are you ready for Guwop?” of the night and Gucci Mane took the stage.

Gucci wasted no time in getting the crowd dancing with his hit, “I Get the Bag.” After the monotony of DJ Champ, Gucci Mane fired up the crowd. Unlike other big artists at festivals who use more elaborate stages or visuals, Gucci Mane performed on a stage barren except for an elevated DJ booth and a backdrop depicting his signature logo of ice cream with lightning bolts. Two songs later, Guwop called backstage, “Hey, get my wife out here,” upon which Keyshia Ka’Oir emerged. The couple share a natural charisma and many fans cheered at her arrival. Their first performance together was Gucci Mane’s “Freaky Gurl.” Although the song was penned in 2006—before Guwop met Ka’Oir—she enthusiastically played the part of the title character in the track, pointing to herself every time the hook came around and Guwop declared, “She’s a very freaky gurl.” Keyshia moved across the stage, dancing to the songs and engaging with the audience. Although it was a rather strange turn to the evening, Guwop and Ka’Oir made a cute couple and it was much more exciting to watch from a distance to have more performers on the otherwise empty stage. The fourth addition to the already three-deep group on the stage (DJ Champ, Gucci Mane, and Keyshia Ka’Oir) was Guwop’s label mate, Asian Doll. Asian Doll is a recent addition to Guwop’s label 1017 Eskimo Records, herself only recently gaining wide listenership accompanied by a national tour with Bhad Bhabie (known also as Danielle Bregoli and “Cash Me Outside” girl). Asian Doll performed her single, “Poppin,” with backup vocal support by Gucci Mane. Asian Doll’s faster flow and more modern trap influences mixed well with Guwop’s more classical interpretation of trap music.

Gucci Mane dedicated his last song of the night, the iconic “First Day Out Tha Feds,” to the memory of his former labelmate, Shawty Lo. Guwop, with the aid of his wife, his official DJ, and Asian Doll, brought the house down with the track, famed for being released the day that Gucci got out of federal prison.

Gucci delivered. It was not a particularly visionary concert—the lights were noticeably lacking in inspiration, and the sound encountered technical difficulties throughout. Despite these technical drawbacks, Gucci Mane was there for the fans. During a brief power failure, Gucci Mane joked with fans, a capella rapped a few verses, and took audience requests for tracks to play after. It was this aspect of Guwop’s energy that sold the performance. The set was far from amazing, but despite its issues, Gucci Mane gave it his all and delivered a great show.

Olivia Noelle
Returning to Panorama after Friday’s tragic rainout, indie pop singer Olivia Noelle delivered an excellent performance at the Bud Light Dive Bar Stage. Noelle was originally scheduled to perform on Friday, but was unable to perform under the circumstances, returning instead on Saturday. Noelle paid tribute to the corporate overlords at Anheuser-Busch with her ballad to drinking and loving, “Fck Around & Fall in Luv.” Olivia Noelle, in being the only cancelled artist from Friday’s debacle to return to the festival on Saturday, has certainly been a force for good at this year’s festival. Although Noelle is not particularly well-known compared to other artists at Panorama, she certainly won herself some new fans with her return to the festival and her dynamic performance in the intimate venue.

Sigrid
Sigrid was the definition of vibrant. The young Norwegian star appeared on stage in colorful pants to a mixed crowd, filled with drunken teenagers and young families alike—all of whom she won over instantly with her fun and lively performance style. With her band dressed all in black, it was clear who we were here to see. Sigrid’s performance electrified the crowd as she performed her power-pop fight song, “Shots Fired.” Sigrid brought further energy and audience participation with a performance of the urgent “High Five,” which wonders if it’s worth looking for shallow approval if all you end up with is “high fives” in the end. Sigrid ended things with a fantastic performance of her hit, “Strangers,” to close out the set. While Sigrid may be eschewed by the brooklynite hipster scene for being too bubblegum-pop, she is an exceptional performer and delivered some much needed energy to the festival.

Japanese Breakfast
After 20 minutes of technical issues and unfortunate feedback screeches, Japanese Breakfast was well worth the wait and the tinnitus risk. Japanese Breakfast (aka Michelle Zauner) brought a more alternative-rock energy to Panorama. Instead of trap drums and synthesizers, Japanese Breakfast came to the Pavilion stage with her own impassioned voice, twinkling guitar, kickin’ drums, and a welcome change in pace to the festival. Her songs, at once haunting and enthralling, captured a slightly older audience for the festival. For all of the wait, the mixing sounded excellent; the guitar’s flanger pedal created a pleasing shimmering sort of sound as the sine waves oscillated. The penultimate song Zauner performed was a phenomenal cover of The Cranberries’ “Dreams.” Japanese Breakfast gave an impressive vocal performance with the melancholy wails at the end of the chorus originally belted by Dolores O’Riordan of The Cranberries. The inclusion of more alternative artists, such as Japanese Breakfast, makes Panorama a much more complete festival, with appeal to many sorts of music lovers and other festival-goers. Japanese Breakfast proved that Panorama attracts not only big name artists, but quality alternative acts.

SZA
The lights glowed red as SZA came onstage at Panorama, a potential savior for the flailing festival. Following Panorama’s long line of cancellations and technical difficulties, expectations were low. SZA began her set with “Supermodel,” which immediately commanded the crowd’s attention with a strong vocal performance and an active stage presence. SZA flew across the stage dancing, taken with the song. SZA also engaged the crowd with her personal life, quipping “I’m going through a break up now—and it’s ass.” She dedicated her next song, “Drew Barrymore” to her ex, and delivered a beautifully felt performance backed by a montage of clips of Drew Barrymore on the main screens, starting from a child actress playing a young Barrymore and gradually rising in age to current day Barrymore, growing up before our eyes over the course of the song. It was a surprisingly gripping performance that worked spectacularly well. The non-traditional video worked excellently with the lyric content of the song, which discusses the difficulties of not being who someone wants you to be. SZA’s performance was captivating and her sound quality was excellent, and there were no technical issues at all. SZA delivered a fantastic show, complete with top-notch vocal chops, endearing personal anecdotes, and eye-catching movie and lighting design—a triumphant performance.

Those who live in the city speak of it like the plague. When the first Metra trains of Lollapalooza weekend roll in, they bring as ballast seas of decommissioned sports jerseys and hastily-applied flash tattoos, the breaking crest of a wave of teenage restlessness borne from Midwestern suburbia. As an expatriate of Chicago’s collar counties, I recognize my own role in feeding this trend with a mixture of guilty self-awareness: Time and time again, I’ve found myself reluctantly entrapped by a romanticized picture of young adult life, the type of feeling that causes a 19-year-old (and, judging by the crowd, many of his cohort) to feel nostalgia for better days past. Khalid’s attempt to capture that feeling in his performance early Thursday evening was a smashing success.
The set itself was standard fare, authentic but understandably expected of a festival act. Khalid knows his brand, and he set up the tone of his show early on with “8teen” and “American Teen.” The tracks were milk smooth, as though they had leapt straight from the studio to the speaker system. Though accompanied by colorful backdrops and a host of charming dancers, he wasn’t afraid to strip things down as the show progressed, punctuating the show with slower songs such as “Coaster.” A couple of changes of pace in the otherwise fairly consistent show were the two collaborations, where the singer brought onto stage Alina Baraz for “Electric” and Normani for “Love Lies.” Still, the show as a whole was mellow and moderate, consistent and perhaps a touch lethargic in the way a summer vacation spent lying in one’s room might be. The anthem of the modern teen, Khalid seems to suggest, isn’t so much an anthem as a lullaby.
Great performances have a way of enveloping the area, enclosing the space with an artist’s trademark atmosphere, and this set was no different. As Khalid invited his guests on stage, he was interrupted by several members of the crowd who had scaled the precipitous heights of nearby sound towers. Whether or not he noticed the recklessness going on around him, the singer made no mention. With his signature nonchalance, he pressed on, leading the audience in in a singalong rendition of “Young, Dumb & Broke.” When the climbers finally made their descent, those around me engaged in a collective shrug. It was just as Khalid had prescribed: They were young, dumb, though thankfully not broken, heedless in a way that the young adults inhabiting his music are.
Whatever it is, Khalid showed us all tonight that he’s got it. I’m talking about the swagger that empowers a person to come onto the second largest stage at one of the largest festivals in the country in gray sweatpants and own it. I’m talking about the energy which compels a performer to jump into the routines of his dancers knowing full well he might botch them, but leaves grinning regardless. I’m talking about the indifference that leads a person to include visuals as disparate as a DDR game, burning flames, and a cartoon human sinking beneath water in a single presentation. Call it teenage exuberance. If you must be cynical, call it teenage hubris. Either way, Khalid has got it, and it’s wonderful.
There was something idyllic about watching the sun gradually creep below the Chicago skyline during Khalid’s performance this evening. The show wasn’t at all flashy or extravagant, and it quite frankly didn’t need to be. Perhaps it’s a bit ironic that Khalid was performing on the Bud Light stage when the majority of experiences he was singing about are long abandoned, ironed-out by the world by the age of 21. Then again, who in the audience would ever need to buy a drink when he’s pouring out teenage wistfulness as if on tap?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Day Two provided ample opportunity to sample Lollapalooza’s deep undercard. Starting the day in the arboreal comfort of American Eagle, I eventually decided to take advantage of the best weather this weekend to bounce around other stages.

Mobley
“There is no frontier,” promised the cryptic lettering that preceded Mobley’s show, a performance deemed a “strange ritual” meant to “coax sound and light from wood and wire.” An indie performer who self-identifies as a one-man-band, Mobley effortlessly blends heavy imagery with instrumental proficiency. Throughout the show, he played with an immaculately executed exploration of music-making, rushing between a keyboard, drumset, and guitar in “Hound the World” to an almost whistle-like megaphone in “2:09 a.m.” At one point, he called up four audience members to produce a human drum machine rigged together by electrical equipment he had assembled himself.
While mesmerizing, this expert ability to shift between devices was only the backdrop for Mobley’s message. The rest was made up primarily of selections from his newest song cycle “Fresh Lies, Vol. I,” a body of work which uses romantic love—or, as in the case of his record “Torch,” the loss of such love—as a way of representing and navigating his identity in the United States. It’s a weighty charge, to be sure, but one that Mobley has shown he has both the technical ability and larger vision to pull off, and as a whole the show came together to provide a thought-provoking start to the day.
Post Animal
Say what you will about Chicago, but there is no denying that we take care of our own. Of course, such support is not difficult when you boast the effervescence that the six-member psychedelic rock band Post Animal exudes. And though they admitted that today’s show was the biggest stage that the group had played on to date, a casual viewer would have no idea given the massive aura they project.
Though their songs do have lyrics, diction seemed like an afterthought. Instead, the band leaned primarily onto instrumentals, stuffing their repertoire replete with electric guitar riffing and occasional musical screaming. Some songs, such as “When I Get Home,” were held up by a pulsing baseline, a sort of rhythmic pressure best felt thoracically. Though laid on thick, the classic rock combination of strings and percussion were cut occasionally by synths: “Tire Eyes” featured an electric, keyboard-like sequence in the background of the track which was a much-needed reprieve from an otherwise intense sequence of pieces. “Ralphie,” a song from their 2018 album “When I Think Of You In A Castle,” is softer than the rest of the set and helps round out the performance. Dripping with energy and homegrown charm—though they preferred to perform rather than speak, several members greeted their mothers in the audience—Post Animal did their city proud today.
Lizzo
“Hi, my name is Lizzo, and I’m all about body positivity and self-love,” introduced the Minnesotan hip hop artist after the third song on her Friday afternoon set. Of course, at that point her actions had rendered any such explanation wholly unnecessary. From the jumping jacks in the song “Fitness,” to the forward request to her audience members to take a photo of her twerking during “Phone,” Lizzo showcased a larger-than-life persona unapologetic about her womanhood and fiercely cognizant of her self-worth.
Lizzo’s performance was marked not by her music, but rather by her stage presence. “En Love,” was complemented by her backup dancers and a bit of well-placed hairography. A short cover of fan favorite “No Scrubs” was tied thematically to the knowing “Jerome Go Home.” In between songs, Lizzo entertained the audience with a notable magnetism. From a twerk tutorial, to a moment of covershoot-esque posing and with the wind blowing her hair, to aphorisms on modern love—“I’m not a game. I’m not chess”—Lizzo guaranteed that audiences would need to see her live in order to experience the full impact of her music. Though her sound was catchy, Lizzo’s true draw is as a beacon of self-love shining beams of self-actualization onto her audiences.

Alina Baraz
Having performed in 2016 at the Pepsi—now American Eagle—stage and Thursday night as one of Khalid’s guests on Bud Light, Cleveland R&B musician Alina Baraz is no stranger to Lollapalooza. That said, her first set on Lake Shore fell just a tad bit flat.
Featuring silky, whispery vocals on tracks like “Fallin’,” Baraz lacks the vocal force needed to fill such a large stage. As a result, she struggled with general lack of stage presence. Even the addition of her backup dancers didn’t seem to really help take up the space: Though they moved fluidly, they were not visually entertaining enough to draw interest towards themselves. There were moments in the set where the sound mixing seemed off: During “Buzzin’,” feedback interrupted her singing, and a later portion of the song was quiet to the point of obscuring the lyrics. And though the bass picks up in “Fantasy,” it didn’t quite take off enough to make the set feel as though it was improving as the songs went on. Finishing several minutes early, the performance felt fairly underwhelming for an artist who has shown that she can bring so much more to the table.
