After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ice may be melting around Cambridge, but there’s still time to look back on the hockey season gone by. And that’s just what the Harvard women’s hockey team did yesterday afternoon in Boston.
The squad’s annual awards banquet honored a trio of outstanding players with major awards, and Crimson coach Katey Stone also announced the captains for next year’s team.
After two years of playing the role of solid contributor, Kate Buesser came into her own as a junior, leading the team with 40 points and being named a finalist for the ECAC Player of the Year. It was not too surprising, therefore, when the forward was named the Most Valuable Player of the Harvard squad.
A dependable contributor throughout the season, Buesser was a big part of the Crimson’s ability to overcome both early-season injuries to junior forward Liza Ryabkina and freshman defenseman Kelsey Romatoski and a season-ending one to senior goaltender Christina Kessler. Harvard was third in the ECAC and earned the fourth seed in the NCAA tournament.
One of those stars will help Buesser lead the squad next year, as Ryabkina and Buesser were named tri-captains for 2010-11 along with junior defenseman Leanna Coskren.
Kessler took home the John Dooley Award, which honors sportsmanship, enthusiasm and devotion to hockey. The all-time winningest goalie in Crimson history set the NCAA career save-percentage record with a .9414 mark and was nominated for the Kazmaier Award in her final, injury-shortened season.
The final award winner was senior Randi Griffin, who was named the team’s Most Improved Player. Griffin, fourth on the team in scoring at season’s end, just got better as the season went on, exemplified in four-goal performance—which included her first career hat trick—on the last weekend of the regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SAN DIEGO—Radcliffe...where is that?
Inevitably, whenever the Harvard women's rowing team travels for training or competition we get questions such as, "Is Radcliffe a college or club team?" or "Does Radcliffe still exist?"
This weekend, the team's top two eights traveled to San Diego, Calif. to compete against some non-Ivy League opponents. We definitely received some inquisitive stares and the usual questions from spectators not used to seeing the black-and-white blades. And while it often becomes a bit annoying to have to explain that we are indeed a college team, that we all go to Harvard, and that Radcliffe isn't actually in existence anymore but that we have maintained the women's college name and colors for tradition's sake, I'd say that we have all come to take some pride in our name and its mysterious origins.
To the best of my knowledge, the Radcliffe team voted to maintain the Radcliffe name and black and white colors when the women's college merged with Harvard College. The vote maintained a legacy that began with women who rowed on the Charles over 50 years ago. And, as a current member of the varsity squad, I have come to appreciate that legacy and the opportunity to enlighten anyone who asks about it at these different events in which we participate.
Plus, it's nice to think of the team as a stealthy squad that people maybe don't know about as much. I like to think that gives us a bit of a leg up on the competition, and a chance to take everyone by surprise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season may have ended nearly two weeks ago for the Harvard men’s basketball team, but the candle is still burning in the office of coach Tommy Amaker.
Finalizing next season’s schedule and fielding calls from NBA scouts has kept Amaker busy as the Crimson men’s basketball coach—a position he doesn’t plan on giving up.
“I’m not looking for anything,” said Amaker, who was listed by one media outlet as a potential candidate for the St. Johns coaching job. “We’re completely happy with what we’re doing here and where we are—and we’re hopeful that the powers that be are happy with me.”
Amaker has now shifted his attention to next season’s schedule and his players’ futures.
After a 2009-10 campaign that pitted the Crimson against UConn, Boston College, and Georgetown, next season’s schedule could be filled with even more big-name opponents.
“We’re playing at Michigan, Colorado [is coming] here, [and] we’re trying to finalize UConn again,” Amaker said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen with BC.”
But that might not be all.
“Instead of going to Seattle, we might try to go to LA or the Bay Area,” Amaker said. “[We’d] play at Southern Cal, UCLA, or Cal Berkeley…Not all of them—maybe one of them.”
In Amaker’s first three seasons at the helm, the Crimson played eight games against opponents from one of the six power conferences, finishing with a 3-5 record.
Harvard defeated Michigan at home in Amaker’s first season, and then beat Boston College on the road in each of the past two seasons.
“[The non-conference schedule has] been a big plus for our program and for recruiting,” he said. “It’s been an aspect we’ve been able to get a lot of mileage out of.”
Individually, co-captain Jeremy Lin was also able to get a lot of mileage out of his play against the team’s toughest non-conference opponents. In games against UConn, Boston College, and Georgetown, Lin averaged 23.3 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game.
These performances boosted Lin’s recognition nationally, both with media outlets and NBA scouts.
Lin’s next big opportunity to impress professional scouts will come Apr. 7-10 when the 6’3” guard travels to Portsmouth, Va. to participate in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, a pre-draft showcase for potential professional players.
While Harvard’s non-conference schedule and Lin’s professional future may remain up in the air, Amaker is absolutely certain of which bench he wants to be standing in front of when the 2010-11 season tips off.

In this four-part series, FlyBy will dish out the details of each  House’s Brain Break so that you know where to go when those evening  munchies hit.
Round 3: Winthrop vs. Eliot vs. Kirkland
Evaluation Day: Wednesday
Eliot: A-/B+
Brain Break Begins: 9 p.m.
Eliot had the basics and then some at the beginning of its brain break. The compact area was host to all the items that are normally available at brain break, including that night’s special: yogurt, hemp plus granola, and HUDS granola. There was even harvest cake—the cinnamon HUDS treat. But by 9:50 pm the place looked like an elephant had gone through and there were no more special items available. Nevertheless, the standard fare was still in place, and no one working on a late-night pset would have gone hungry.
Kirkland: A
Brain Break Begins: 9 p.m.
Kirkland had everything Eliot had minus the harvest cake and plus a plentiful supply of food as of 9:54 pm Not much to say here—Kirkland fed itself well.
Winthrop: A
Brain Break Begins: 8:30 p.m.
Winthrop got the same grade as Kirkland for the same reasons that Kirkland earned its A, but Winthrop stole the show with a brain break that edged out the competition. Not only did Winthrop stock the special items and the standard fare, but it also supplemented the late-night snack with cocoa rice krispies treats and an assortment of pies. Winthrop would have managed to execute a flawless victory, but its selection of cereals was incomplete.
Winner of Round 3: Winthrop

Stone Cold Steve Austin made an appearance in Cambridge on Friday to grill burgers and throw back a couple of drinks at The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
The Lampoon hosted the event with the former World Wrestling Entertainment star in order "to make amends and celebrate our renewed friendship" (according to invitations left in the House), which was likely in reference to the distribution of 9/11-themed "Lever Forget" t-shirts on Housing Day.
Lured by e-mails sent over house lists inviting students to a BBQ presented by "The Harvard Lampoon and Leverett House," crowds began to form in front of the Lampoon Castle shortly before 6 p.m. Friday. The festivities kicked off when Lampoon editors began to grill burgers and play guitars in front of the colorful doors of the Lampoon Castle. Several minutes later, Austin himself emerged from the castle amid cheers from those Cantabs in attendance.
Rather than flipping wrestlers on their backs, Austin assumed control of the grill and flipped burgers instead. After several drinks, he was also spotted chatting away with students in the crowd.
Leverett House denies any involvement with the Lampoon event.
"Leverett HoCo was never approached by the Lampoon for this event. I had not seen the 'Harvard Lampoon and Leverett House present' invitations, and to my knowledge that invite was not sent over Lev Open," said Leverett House Committe Co-Chair Allison L. Sikora '11.
"In my opinion, this is just another Lampoon prank veiled as an olive branch for their tasteless Housing Day stunt in which they distributed shirts that not only had an inappropriate reference to the events of Sept. 11 but also used the image and name of Leverett House without permission," she added.
