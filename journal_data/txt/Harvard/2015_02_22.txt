After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first moments of the series premiere of “Better Call Saul” are shot in black and white, so it takes a moment to recognize the mustachioed manager working behind the mall Cinnabon counter as Saul Goodman—partly because of the lack of color, and partly because this is so tragically far from the fast-paced, darkly comic Saul of “Breaking Bad.” When he returns to his Omaha home, a location that informs the viewer that this is indeed a snapshot of Saul in his post-“Breaking Bad” relocation, he looks shiftily outside his window and closes his blinds. He proceeds not to plan his conniving escape; rather, he inserts into his TV a VHS tape of his old commercials and sits watching them blankly, in a pathetic encapsulation of the immense change his life has undergone.
In these few minutes, showrunner Vince Gilligan quashes any expectation that “Better Call Saul” might be simply a concentration of the comic relief Bob Odenkirk provided on “Breaking Bad.” This is not to say that “Better Call Saul” is never funny, but rather that the humor of this prequel is intensely dark and could hardly be termed “relief.” In the second episode of the two-part premiere, Jimmy McGill (Saul’s real name, and the name he goes by when the show begins) bargains with an enraged Tuco Salamanca in a parody of a lawyer discussing a sentence with a judge and manages to talk him down from murdering two men to just breaking their legs. Jimmy’s office, from which he is struggling to begin a law firm while working as a pro bono defense attorney, is located at the back of a nail salon, a juxtaposition that is amusing until he desperately tries to rearrange his furniture and make the tiny space presentable when an apparent client comes knocking.
Such a reversal of viewers’ expectations might have been a terrible choice were Bob Odenkirk not such a capable actor. He masterfully played the over-the-top Saul of “Breaking Bad” without verging into ridiculousness; in only the first two episodes of “Better Call Saul,” he has already proven his skill as a dramatic actor. His relationship with Chuck, his brother and an accomplished lawyer who has had to leave his firm due to emerging psychosis, is tenderly and subtly depicted. In a scene in which he argues with his brother over the latter’s wearing a “space blanket” to protect himself from Jimmy’s cell phone, Odenkirk beautifully communicates the conflicted frustration that comes with dealing with a loved one who is as sick as Chuck is.
But Chuck’s situation also illustrates the trap into which “Better Call Saul” is in danger of falling: in choosing a tone quite similar to that of “Breaking Bad,” Gilligan has introduced the risk of simply recreating his award-winning show with different characters. The parallels between Chuck and Walt are particularly prominent: both have been somewhat cut out of prosperous companies they helped found, and both suffer from chronic illness. Fortunately, “Better Call Saul” has so many of its own legs to stand on that it has no need to make more callbacks to “Breaking Bad” than it already has. If Gilligan realizes this, “Better Call Saul” has the potential to become another generation-defining show.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oscar season: the time of the year when everyone denounces the Academy as a backwards, old-fashioned, and prude institution that only favors artsy-fartsy movies about war and alienated geniuses. Another year, another snub for this self-proclaimed authority on achievement in film. It is unfortunate that so much importance is placed on the opinions of this exclusive, far-from-representative group of people. These nominations reveal the complications that arise from attempting to judge a subjective art medium as well as the growing divide between mass audiences and an aging Academy.
Ava DuVernay, the director of “Selma,” was glaringly omitted from the Best Director category, where she could have been the first female African-American there. Her passionate and fiery direction injects the film with a sense of purpose and conviction, which carries through in David Oyelowo’s performance as Martin Luther King Jr. Also criminally snubbed for Best Actor, Oyelowo’s resounding voice and arresting presence coupled with a comforting, southern sensibility commands the audience’s attention. He imbues into King a humanity that elevates this biopic to one of the most important movies of the year: both a timely reaction to the events in Ferguson and a strongly-worded claim for justice for African Americans everywhere. There are moments in “Selma” that reenact the hateful violence inflicted upon the Selma protesters and evoke shock and even guilt. Its political pedagogy, similar to that found in that of “Lincoln,” is imbued with the furious outrage seen in “12 Years a Slave” and succeeds on both levels.
Aside from a Best Original Song nomination, everything is not so awesome for “The Lego Movie,” which is undoubtedly the best animated movie of the year. Helmed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord, the minds behind the Jump Street reboots, the film is smart in its commentary on uniformity, self-aware of its product placement design, and heartwarming in its story about creativity in a world of business. Energetic and restless, it exudes imagination for adults who want to feel like kids again. That it did not even receive a nomination for Best Animated Feature is a travesty and an indication of the generational gap between the film’s loving audience and the Academy. Labeled a children’s film, “The Lego Movie” actually provides more for adult viewers than anything about Lego would be expected to.
Other disappointments include the omission of Jake Gyllenhaal, who was stellar in “Nightcrawler”, where he gave a calculating, cold, and ruthless portrayal of an immoral yet somehow likeable man. His was a weirder, offbeat performance that impressed] audiences, but has had trouble winning awards. “Nightcrawler” only received one nomination for Best Original Screenplay, recognizing the sharp writing that granted Gyllenhaal the material to deliver one of his finest performances yet. In addition, Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor’s score for “Gone Girl” also deserved to be nominated for Best Original Score, as it contributed an oppressing, unsettling atmosphere to the criminal proceedings of the thriller. It is also disappointing not to see a Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay nomination for David Fincher and Gillian Flynn, respectively. Perhaps the film’s pulpy premise failed to resonate with the Academy in spite of its sophisticated commentary on marriage and gender dynamics.
“Wild” was another visually remarkable film that received the short end of nominations. While Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern received nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively, the excellent direction and adapted screenplay remain unrecognized in this female-driven story about finding one’s better self. Witherspoon’s performance as Cheryl Strayed gives a truly strong female heroine that transcends the damsel archetype. Rather, she is scarred and battered, enduring pain and prejudice as she makes her way across the wilderness. By comparison, all the Best Picture nominees feature only male leads. In an industry dominated by a male perspective, “Wild” is an important film that, while overlooked by the Academy, should not be forgotten.
Despite any frustrations one might have with the nominations, it is still important to celebrate film rather than be preoccupied with the particular details of what did or did not make the cut. These conversations are an exercise in appreciating the unsung films of 2014 (at least according to the Academy). This problem stems from the inevitable failure in attempting to satisfy an entire audience’s expectations. Having all the “right” nominations is analogous to making the perfect film: it just doesn’t happen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite forcing 18 turnovers, the Harvard men’s basketball team (19-5, 9-1 Ivy) still found itself locked even with Princeton (12-13, 5-4) at 53-all with just 2:50 remaining in Saturday night’s contest. In the second half, the Crimson had overcome what was once a 12-point deficit, awakening a sold-out Lavietes Pavilion crowd.
As senior forward Jonah Travis pressured the ball, an errant pass resulted in a Harvard steal, as junior co-captain Siyani Chambers collected the ball, sped up the court, and laid the ball it in for the lead.
“Coach [Tommy Amaker] still emphasizes playing our defense even against people that are going to back cut and to trust your help side,” Chambers said. “I was one pass away and denied like we’re supposed to do.”
Then, after two made free throws from senior wing Wesley Saunders on the ensuing possession, Chambers, who finished with 12 points, put the game away. The co-captain crossed over, side stepped, and drained the jumper to put the icing on the cake with 46 seconds remaining.
“We were supposed to hand off and get it to Wes, but he got trapped,” Chambers said. “I just pulled up and was lucky enough to make the shot…. It’s a shot that I’m confident in.”
Though Harvard would go on to win 63-55, the Tigers gave the home team all that it could handle. Princeton went on a 14-2 run in the first half, holding the Crimson for nearly six minutes without a field goal in order to take a 37-29 lead into the break.
“They were very efficient and sharp,” Amaker said. “We weren’t able to make a lot of baskets that were around the rim, and we missed a lot of things.”
The famed Tiger offense caused problems for Harvard’s defense all night, as backdoor cuts to the basket resulted in several uncontested Princeton layups. On top of that, a balanced scoring attack and seven made three-pointers kept the Crimson’s defense from cheating on any of the backdoor passes.
“We had a lot of little breakdowns,” Saunders said. “We played solid defense for the first part of the clock it seemed like, and then we would just have some kind of lapse and bail them out with an easy shot.”
Saunders led all scorers with 23 points, as the senior wrecked havoc in the lane. Nonetheless, in the first half, Saunders was just 4-for-11, creating space for himself but missing shots that have become customary makes for the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year.
“In the first half, I was just missing some shots that I usually make,” Saunders said. “I knew though that’s why they play two halves, so I just wanted to refocus for the second half and hit some shots.”
That is exactly what Saunders did. From the beginning of the second half, Saunders took over. After a steal on the Tigers’ opening possession, Saunders missed a jumper, grabbed the offensive board, and finished the layup as he drew the foul. From there, the Crimson offense came alive.
However, with the rest of the team finally getting open shots to fall, sophomore guard Corbin Miller seemed to have the shades drawn on him all night. After dropping 19 points in Harvard’s win at Princeton earlier this year, Miller struggled to find an open shot and was face guarded all night.
“They were attached to [Corbin] every time he was at the scorer’s table ready to check in,” Amaker said. “They did a terrific job limiting his opportunities to catch and shoot…[but] we found other ways.”
However, the combined effort of frontcourt stalwarts co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and Travis (22 combined points) was more than enough to make up for Miller, as the Crimson scored 34 points in the second half.
Meanwhile, 130 miles away in New Haven, Conn., Columbia took down Yale, 56-50, giving the Bulldogs their second league loss of the season. As a result, Harvard gained sole possession of first place in the Ancient Eight with its season-high eighth straight win of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
POTSDAM, N.Y.—In an interview days before the Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s season began, forward Jimmy Vesey talked about his individual objectives for his junior season. One in particular stood out: to become the first Crimson player since Alex Killorn ’12 to score 20 goals in a season.
On Saturday, Vesey’s 20th was a special one—an impressive unassisted breakaway that put Harvard up two goals at 4:41 in the second period. After 60 minutes, the strike proved to be the game-winner as No. 14/13 Harvard (14-9-3, 10-7-3 ECAC) beat Clarkson (11-17-4, 8-10-2), 3-2, in a chippy effort at Cheel Arena.
“I thought we played well for long stretches of the game,” Vesey said. “[It was] kind of ugly in the third period, but it’s a sign of good things to come and a sign of a good team when you can weather the storm like that and get the two points, especially on the road.”
After a 5-1 loss to No. 20/- St. Lawrence Friday night, Harvard coach Ted Donato’91 entered Saturday wanting to shake things up. He moved junior Brian Hart and sophomore Tyler Moy back to the lines and positions at which the forwards had started the year and, for the first time this season, tabbed the second line to take the opening faceoff.
“We just mixed things up a little bit,” Donato said. "We went kind of back in time with some of our combinations."
Donato’s changes responded early, with Lloyd jamming the game’s first goal past the pad of Clarkson sophomore goaltender Steve Perry (18 saves) off a behind-the-net feed from Moy at 2:55 in the period. Co-captain Max Everson followed Lloyd moments later at 6:13 on the power play with a top-shelf strike from above the left faceoff circle.
The Crimson’s third goal came from Vesey, who picked off a Clarkson pass in the neutral zone and split defensemen Kevin Tansey and James de Haas at the blue line to create a breakaway up the slot and beat Perry at the crease.
“I didn’t know if I could split them,” Vesey said. “I knew one of them was kind of near Clarkson’s bench. I thought that Tansey might have had a break on me…[but] I was able to keep it out of his reach.”
The early goals were enough to cancel out first and third period markers from Clarkson’s A.J. Fossen in a game in which between-whistle play and officiating often took center stage.
With 1:23 left in the second period and Harvard up, 3-1, sophomore forward Sean Malone barreled into the Clarkson net, prompting a full-line scuffle. Harvard emerged shorthanded and down a defender, with sophomore forward Luke Esposito receiving a cross checking minor and Crimson defenseman Clay Anderson and Golden Knight forward Nic Pierog receiving matching 10-minute misconducts and roughing minors.
Later, with 1:58 left in regulation, Malone had appeared to beat Clarkson forward Jeff DiNallo in a footrace for a cleared puck. Instead, the play was whistled dead for a Harvard icing, allowing the Golden Knights to send in an extra attacker and sending the Harvard bench into a fury. Moments later, Clarkson received another offensive zone faceoff after another questionable icing call.
Donato gesticulated wildly at the officials before climbing onto the boards in protest after the call on Malone’s play. Yet through the final minutes, Harvard’s defense responded to the extra challenges.
“I thought our players battled there, and we kind of simplified things,” said a more composed Donato after the game. “Last night we weren’t very good, so it was nice to bounce back here tonight.”
For Clarkson, the star of the night was Fossen, who doubled his season goal total with a pair. His first came off a feed from linemate Troy Josephs into the slot after Sam Vigneault knocked the puck loose along the Harvard boards. Fossen added another at 11:34 in the third period, finishing backdoor off a cross-ice feed from Terrance Amorosa to draw the game to 3-2.
From there, junior goaltender Steve Michalek (33 saves) and his supporting cast weathered a series of Clarkson surges, including a persistent final effort with an extra attacker for the game’s final two minutes. Michalek bailed out his team on several occasions throughout the night, and sophomore defenseman Victor Newell and Moy produced key shot blocks.
The win did not come without a cost for Harvard. Third-line freshman forward Jake Horton left the game in the first period and did not return.
By the final horn, however, the visitors had regained control of their postseason destiny. With two conference regular season games remaining and a 6-3 Dartmouth loss at St. Lawrence on Saturday, Harvard controls fourth place in the ECAC standings and the first-round bye in the conference tournament that would come with it.
“All in all, it was just a very good two points for us,” Donato said.
