After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Khadar Ayderus Ahmed's directorial debut, “The Gravedigger’s Wife,” brought an earnest, somber warmth to the festival’s opening day. The film is one of seven by first-time directors to compete before the 60th Semaine de la Critique (Critics Circle) jury, vying for their Best Feature award.
The film is set on the outskirts of Djibouti City and revolves around the relationship between couple Guled (Omar Abdi) and Nasra (Yasmin Warsame) and their young son Mahad (Khadar Abdoul-Aziz Ibrahim). When Nasra falls sick with kidney disease, her husband and child must decide how much they are willing to give up to try and save her.
The film’s entire cast is made up of non-professional actors, most of whom were “street cast” (asked to audition on the street) by Ahmed. Among them, Warsame, a former supermodel and first-time actress, is a particular standout, capturing the suffering buried beneath her character’s mask of strength and restraint in a moving, albeit slightly overdone performance. First-time child actor Ibrahim struggles in some of the film’s earlier and more serious scenes, but grows into the role after his character accepts his mother’s fate and earnestly takes on the role of “man of the house” in an attempt to take care of her.
In one particularly moving scene, Mahad cooks dinner for his bedridden mother, and they seem to take turns being the parent. Mahad has the childlike optimism of a kid convinced that he can cook his sick mother back to health, as she frets over the smoke from the kitchen and he tells her confidently that she has nothing to worry about. But then he returns to the child forced to grow up too fast; his mother tries to reassert her parenting role by asking him about schoolboy crushes, and he replies with an unexpected heaviness — “I’m too young for that.”
The film shines in scenes of the family struggling to figure out how much to lean on each other, and Ahmed’s impressive ability to add a visual beauty and dignity to the couple's bleak story turns what could have been a monotonous film into something much softer and nuanced. A consistent warm-hued filter lends a feeling of empathy and homeliness to loving shots of the village and natural landscape; it's a palette that pulls the viewer into Guled and Nasra’s community and family. The film also often utilizes dramatic exposure, contrast, and lighting in intimate scenes between the couple: The brilliant sunlight dapples across Nasra’s face to give her an air of radiance, or further highlights her expressive face as she caresses her husband. Along with many lingering closeups of her, Ahmed’s cinematography choices further paint her as the ultimate prize, the altar upon which the more passive Guled worships.
Unfortunately, between these moments of radiance, the “The Gravedigger’s Wife” is often held back by poor pacing and a thin plot. Significant plot developments and meaningful conversations are few and far between, as much of the movie consists of long, indulgent, almost casual shots of Guled at work with his fellow gravediggers, walking through the desert, or passing through the bustling village. As a result, audiences spend long periods of time waiting for something to happen, and though Ahmed makes sure we're all well acquainted with the family, his drawn out shot selection and slow pacing lack both a sense of purpose and direction.
Nevertheless, the strength of the main characters allows the film to succeed in compellingly illustrating, as Ahmed intended, the preventable suffering many Africans face as they struggle to access medical care. “An operation like this would be easy to obtain in Western countries,” Ahmed explained in an interview. “In a post-colonial world, people have decided to look away and left Africans without tools to survive." With touching, intimate moments of connection, hope, and despair that linger long after the lights dim, “The Gravedigger’s Wife” certainly ensures that international audiences will no longer be able to look away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 1, 2021 at 4:45 p.m.
Maryland rapper IDK will teach a tuition-free music business seminar at Harvard for BIPOC students this August.
Applications for IDK’s No Label Academy went live in June. No musical or business experience is required, and students will be housed near campus during the course, which starts on Aug. 21.
IDK said that his 10-day seminar is targeting BIPOC individuals interested in pursuing careers in the music industry.
“This [course] is predominantly for people that wouldn't have gone to Harvard, per se,” the rapper said. “It’s for people who think that the idea of Harvard is impossible, just doing anything there and being on that campus is an attraction in itself.”
The seminar has attracted numerous sponsors — including Logitech, Jordan Brand, Guess, and Converse — as well as a course launch through the Nike SNKRS app.
No Label Academy is a continuation of IDK’s relationship with No Label Live, a 501(c)(3) registered non-profit founded by Harvard College students Marcelo Hanta-Davis ’20 and Miles Weddle ’20 in 2018.
Hanta-Davis and Weddle created No Label with the goal of using pop culture to promote education and address social issues.
“It largely started from a place of wanting to bring Harvard together, like finding a medium by which to bring students together regardless of race, socioeconomic status, etc.” Weddle said. “We realized that music is the one thing that brings everyone together.”
Since the inception of No Label, the organization has brought a plethora of notable industry figures to speak on campus, including Travis Scott, Saweetie, J.I.D., and Post Malone’s manager Dre London.
No Label team member and marketing strategist Marissa Joseph ’23 said that attending the Saweetie event in November 2019 as an audience member is what initially inspired her to get involved with the non-profit.
“For me, there wasn't a single club at Harvard that was doing the work that No Label was doing,” Joseph said. “As soon as I got the opportunity to join the team, I jumped on it.”
In February 2020, Hanta-Davis and Weddle invited IDK to the Smith Campus Center to speak about criminal justice reform as part of No Label’s “Uncut” speaker series.
Immediately after the February event, the three began to brainstorm what would eventually become No Label Academy.
“We got on a call together the next day after the event and started brainstorming more things that we could do together,” Hanta-Davis said. “The idea of doing a course at Harvard where we teach music business in an innovative way was something that piqued our interest.”
Hanta-Davis said that the 2020 summer Black Lives Matter movement protesting racial injustice and the murder of George Floyd by police informed the necessity of an idea like No Label Academy.
“What we wanted to do was to create an educational platform that allows for Black creators and people from underrepresented backgrounds to have the knowledge about things that are taboo to talk about such as mental health or hard to understand like financial literacy,” Hanta-Davis said.
“It's about giving people that baseline education so that they can have an equal seat at the table,” he added.
According to IDK, the global popular culture domination of hip-hop has paved the way for the existence of a program like No Label Academy.
“The way the industry is today is new,” he said. “The acceptance of rappers, specifically being able to partner with companies that have been around for ages, is a new concept. A lot of people were afraid of us just a few years ago.”
“This idea of rap in collaboration with academia would be crazy not to pursue because of how much influence rap music has today,” IDK added.
Led by IDK, Hanta-Davis and Weddle, the No Label team has worked to build the curriculum for No Label Academy since last year.
Will Diamond, the creative design lead for the team, said that IDK’s hands-on approach and industry connections helped establish No Label Academy as a brand.
“IDK understands the impact that a good branding can have,” Diamond said. “He has a lot of control over how he displays himself. I think that transfers into a really clear vision and that's something that he's really provided for us.”
The course aims to translate IDK’s professional background as a recording artist into actionable wisdom for prospective students, according to Weddle.
“We really approached this from the perspective of how we can leverage IDK’s personal experience as an artist to really build the foundation of what the curriculum looks like and then go out source experts who can add additional lenses,” Weddle said.
To help address potential blindspots in the No Label Academy curriculum, the team brought in Harvard Law Professor Brian Price and LaShyra Nolan, the first Black woman to become class president of Harvard Medical School, as advisors.
With the application process now underway, The No Label Academy team is searching for its inaugural class of students.
The application process comprises three rounds: an initial survey, a video essay, and a final round interview, according to Maddie Kelly ’20, who runs the process.
“Our ideal candidate is someone who has a real passion for the music industry and wants to make tangible changes within it,” Kelly said.
Over 700 applications were submitted in the first 24 hours following the launch.
After the first iteration of No Label Academy runs in August, IDK said he has plans to expand the mission statement of his 10-day seminar to all 50 states.
“I hope that the impact of the academy is to show people that the idea of music as a career is more realistic than what the world thinks it is today,” the rapper said.
According to Weddle, it is a running joke among the No Label team that they hope their organization becomes “the Coachella of education.”
