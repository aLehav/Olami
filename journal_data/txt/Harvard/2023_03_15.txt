After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2023, at 8:37 p.m.
Consulting firm McKinsey & Company and Harvard Hillel’s executive director criticized the Arab Conference at Harvard’s decision to invite Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian rights activist and an activist for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, which advocates for institutions globally to sever ties with Israel.
The Arab Conference at Harvard, organized by the Harvard Arab Alumni Association and various student groups, was held virtually and in-person from March 3 to March 5. ACH is the “largest pan-Arab conference in North America,” hosting more than 1,300 students and professionals and 20,000 virtual attendees, according to its website.
McKinsey, one of the sponsors for the conference, wrote in a March 6 statement that it withdrew its sponsorship after learning that Sarsour would be speaking at the event.
“When we learned late last week that a speaker at an event our recruiting team was sponsoring at Harvard University had a history of anti-Semitic comments, we immediately stepped away from the conference, canceled our in-person recruiting meeting, and withdrew two speakers from the program,” the statement reads.
“We condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms and stand for inclusion and tolerance everywhere,” the statement continues.
In an interview, Sarsour described the conference as “absolutely wonderful.”
“I don’t even know who they are,” she said, referring to McKinsey. “I had a wonderful time. And I’m sure the people who attended had a wonderful time, regardless of whether McKinsey was there or not.”
The three-day conference featured an array of panels on topics ranging from politics and policymaking in Arab countries to healthcare advancements in the Middle East and North Africa region.
Conference Co-Chair Heba H. Mohamed ’23 praised the line-up of speakers during the opening ceremony on March 3  as a “powerful gathering”, which she said included “human rights defenders, lawyers, physicians, humanitarians, prime ministers, global leaders, and so many more.”
On March 6, Jewish Insider reported that Sarsour — whose views on Israel have drawn scrutiny and allegations of anti-Semitism — said during her talk at the conference that she was “not afraid of Zionists in America.”
“I’m not afraid of people trying to silence me, because nothing that I experience here in the United States — not cancelation, not a headline in this country — is ever going to be anything compared to what our people experience under siege and under military occupation,” Sarsour said, according to Jewish Insider.
In a March 7 email to Hillel affiliates, Harvard Hillel Executive Director Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg criticized Sarsour’s appearance and remarks at the conference.
“Jewish community and its leaders, however, are faced with accusations — most recently by Linda Sarsour, in her appearance at the Arab Conference — that all of us who care about Israel somehow are ‘trying to silence’ our Arab peers and colleagues at Harvard and others who care for Palestinian rights and aspirations of self-determination,” Steinberg wrote.
“Jews at Harvard largely experience such allegations not only as painful and prejudiced but also as deeply ironic,” he added.
Sarsour said in an interview that she is “open to have a conversation instead of statements that are out of context” in response to Steinberg’s email.
Mohamed, who served as conference co-chair, wrote that the student groups co-organizing the conference “strongly condemn racial discrimination in all its forms” in a statement on behalf of the groups.
“Just like we uphold equality for all, we also uphold everyone’s fundamental right to speech and expression, within the confinements of law,” she wrote. “In light of this, ACH stands by its decision to invite all of its speakers, who are all ardent advocates for justice and freedom for all.”
Mohamed wrote that “no speaker on any panel” has “spread hate speech or otherwise made inflammatory statements towards any ethnic, racial or other minority.”
“We therefore regret that some individuals and media outlets have nevertheless chosen to denigrate ACH notwithstanding the lack of any legitimate ground to do so,” she wrote. “We regret that Mckinsey withdrew their decision to participate as sponsors the day of the conference, particularly when that decision had not been accompanied by adequate justification to our team.”
Steinberg’s statement attributed the line, “when we’re talking about this youth movement for Palestine, Harvard is a perfect example,” to Sarsour. According to Sarsour and Jewish Insider, the quotation was actually from conference speaker Mohamad Habehh, the director of development at American Muslims for Palestine.
After being asked for comment on the mistaken attribution, Steinberg issued a correction to Hillel affiliates on Saturday evening. Steinberg also personally apologized to Sarsour for the misattribution, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
“I remain alarmed at Ms. Sarsour’s having encouraged antipathy toward Zionism and Israel on campus, and having presented her views in that regard as uniting her audience at the Harvard Arab Conference,” Steinberg wrote in his follow-up email to Hillel affiliates.
Shir Lovett-Graff, a master’s student at Harvard Divinity School and an organizer for HDS Jews for Liberation, said they found Hillel’s response to the conference disappointing.
“As a Jewish student, as a Jewish student organizational leader, it’s really disappointing to me, and it does not represent all Jewish students, nor Jewish voices at Harvard,” they said.
Nadine S. Bahour ’22, a former co-president of the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, wrote in an email that Steinberg “has abused his institutionally supported role and the power that comes with his position to target student-organized events, students, and myself personally.”
“Ultimately, however, the reaction is only a testament to the rising voices speaking out against apartheid, and the changing student body opinion,” she wrote. “People are starting to realize the reality on the ground in Palestine.”
Steinberg wrote in a statement that he was “not aware of having ‘targeted’ anyone in the PSC personally.”
Steinberg added that it is his responsibility to support the students affected by the event.
“As a Jewish chaplain at Harvard, it is my duty to call out in support of the many students here whom anti-Semitism threatens,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Missouri Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Bill Stackman will become the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ new dean of students, Stackman confirmed in a Monday email to The Crimson.
Stackman’s selection concludes a monthslong search for the school’s next dean of students following the departure of Samuel H. Bersola in July 2022. Stackman is expected to succeed interim Dean of Students Sheila Thomas in July 2023, becoming the third person to fill the permanent position in just over three years.
The appointment has not yet been officially announced by the University, which declined to comment.
Stackman received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Kentucky and his doctorate in educational leadership from Boston University. Stackman has worked in higher education for 40 years, serving as associate vice president for student services at the University of Notre Dame, director of student activities at Texas A&M University, and dean of student affairs at Rhodes College, among other administrative roles at institutions of higher education.
In an email to the University of Missouri’s President’s Council — a group of student organization leaders — Sunday afternoon, Stackman announced that he would be stepping down from his post at Mizzou in July to serve as “Dean of Students at Harvard University.”
“This departure is totally unexpected and proved to be a very difficult decision,” he wrote.
In a subsequent email to The Crimson, Stackman clarified that he will be assuming the role of dean of students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
In a message to faculty, University of Missouri President Mun Y. Choi thanked Stackman for his four years with the university.
“He has been a tireless advocate for our students, a collaborative partner in our academic success initiatives, has worked closely with our faculty and staff, and has helped the university achieve growth in student engagement and retention,” Choi wrote.
With a resume in higher education stretching back more than four decades, Stackman brings extensive experience to a role that has lacked stability in recent years. The position’s responsibilities have been performed by three different administrators in the three years following the departure of longtime GSAS Dean of Students Garth O. McCavana in 2020.
Bersola, Stackman’s predecessor, departed the role in July 2022 to “return to his family in Southern California,” according to an emailed statement from GSAS Dean Emma Dench at the time of his departure.
Bersola — the former assistant vice provost for graduate education at the University of California, Los Angeles — was referenced in a 2020 civil lawsuit against UCLA filed by Margaret Purnell, a former assistant dean in the university’s graduate division.
Purnell’s suit alleges pregnancy discrimination by UCLA’s administration during her employment there. In her complaint, Purnell alleged that Bersola made “inappropriate and insensitive comments regarding children,” which included “comparing the employees’ children to his dogs.” The complaint also claims that Bersola subsequently became critical of Purnell’s performance and was insensitive to her medical needs and requests for time off during her “high-risk” pregnancy.
In an order granting partial summary judgment, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Curtis A. Kin wrote that a “reasonable juror could find that Bersola trivializes childcare responsibilities” and that he was “biased against pregnant women and women who undergo childbirth.” The case is set to go before a jury on June 12.
Bersola did not respond to requests for comment. GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall pointed to the statement from Dench announcing Bersola’s departure but declined to comment on the ongoing lawsuit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A buzzerbeater shot at the end of the second quarter dramatically shifted the tide of the Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s (2-2-0) game against the University of Michigan. Harvard took an early lead against the Wolverines, but a post-timeout stretch of six unanswered goals in the second quarter for the Michigan squad marked the end of a nine-game winning streak for the Crimson on Jordan Field.
Michigan drew first blood with a goal by standout junior attacker Michael Boehm. Boehm took advantage of one area Harvard had been working on this week in practice: one-on-one coverage. He bodied his way around the left side of the cage, working in a shifty rocker dodge that got sophomore defenseman Martin Nelson out of position so that he could bury the ball with a lefty sidearm rip. The momentum initially shifted back and forth between the teams, with each offense responding to post two goals on board.
Harvard seemed to run away with the game after this initial bout, scoring six unanswered goals on the Wolverine defense. The attack initially had trouble dissecting the Michigan defensive rotations, with the Wolverines successfully stretching the offense and getting on the hands of the Harvard attackers, eliminating the outside lanes that the attack typically exploits. Harvard’s offense shifted the momentum of the game with about four minutes left to play in the first quarter.
An athletic save from junior goalie Christian Barnard turned into a textbook fast-break play, with first-year defender Charlie Muller scooping up a ground ball that popped loose on the Michigan shot. Muller outletted the ball to senior d-middie Chase Yager, who carried the ball down the field, hitting an open first-year attacker Teddy Malone on the doorstep for an easy finish. The excitement of the goal translated into a second-straight goal on the fast-break, this time by sophomore d-middie Andrew O’Berry. O’Berry has been an integral part of the midfield squad for the Crimson, oftentimes playing both ways. His offensive acumen was obvious as he flew down the field, pushed the ball into the box and took advantage of a miscommunication by the Wolverine defense, which failed to slide for fear of leaving another attacker open down low.
The offensive sets for the Crimson were particularly effective when the Michigan defense marked up man-to-man. Harvard engaged its defenders, dodging hard to approach its matches and draw the slide to try to free up either the adjacent or the skip. Heads-up plays by sophomore midfielders Andrew Perry and Owen Gaffney and sophomore attacker Sam King allowed the offense to rotate the ball quickly, cut decisively into the middle, and free up space for inside looks.
Michigan head coach Kevin Conry took a timeout about five minutes into the second quarter, and this time to reset and refocus his squad ultimately got Michigan back on track. After this break, the Wolverines outscored Harvard 16-4. The biggest change Coach Conry made was shifting his defense out of its man-to-man and into a zone, something the Crimson offense has been having trouble tackling all season.
“After our immediate success in the game, Michigan switched up to a zone, nothing that we weren’t prepared for. We had a lot of good offensive possessions and takes, but, regardless, their goalie made a lot of good saves early on in the zone, giving them some momentum on the offensive side,” Malone noted.
The zone also proved difficult for the offense on its man-up sets. The Crimson had three opportunities on the extra-man, but was unable to convert on any of its attempts. This trouble was not solely getting takes off because of the zone, it also had to do with shot-selection.
Goalie domination, both with athletic plays as well as easy saves from sloppy Crimson shots, was a big contributor in the Wolverines’ success, with their goalie tallying 17 saves on the Crimson’s 30 shots on goal. Part of this total had to do with decision making by the Crimson’s young offense. Harvard is known for its fast pace of play, which at times during caused the offense to rush its sets and take less-than-perfect opportunities.
“We are definitely going to practice playing against that zone, as well as all facets of the game. We’ve got to focus on game situations,” King said. “Knowing when to shoot and when not to shoot.”
Another area that put the Crimson at a disadvantage was at the faceoff. Harvard won less than a third of its takes, only winning possession time on 11 of 35 faceoffs. By not securing the ball in the circle, the team faced unequal possession time on the offensive end. Without the ball, and without the ability to attack, Harvard had trouble shutting down the shifty Michigan attack, clearing the ball, and then putting up goals. By losing the ball early in the play, the Crimson is  forced to be cohesive and dominant in all areas of the field. The defense needs to be able to hold off the opposing attack and get the ball across the fifty, which makes scoring much more difficult and reliant on both ends of the field performing.
“I give credit to that unit. They are very experienced and very good. We went up against them last year and they showed up today, and we didn’t show up today, it’s as simple as that,” sophomore FOGO Andrew DeGennaro said.
A loss of possession at the faceoff translated into more time on the defensive end. For the first part of the game, the defense did a better job of holding off the Wolverine offense, forcing it to make mistakes that translated into the team’s thirty turnovers. However, a bit of momentum gave the Michigan offense a fire, and it started to exploit some of the Crimson’s weaknesses. Michigan is a slippery team, and the trio of Boehm, sophomore attacker Ryan Cohen and senior attacker Josh Zawada’s craftiness ultimately tripped up the Crimson defense. The Wolverines also utilized a heavy pick game, which created moments of hesitation and miscommunication for Harvard’s defensive trio.
“The pick game is something that we have to continue to improve on. It is definitely something that showed in this game as something that we didn’t do very well, and so it is something that we are definitely going to work to improve going forward in practice,” commented Nelson.
Going into league play this upcoming weekend, the Crimson squad will look to improve and finetune all facets of its game.
“We’ll get back to the drawing board, we have Brown next Saturday and we’ll watch the film. There’s always learning from a loss like that, and so obviously we’ll watch the film and get ready to get on the road for Saturday,” DeGennaro said. “But, other than that, right now, we’re just going to see what plagued us most during this game and hope to rebound from that.”
A point of praise for the Crimson team was its determination in not giving up until the last whistle. Going into Brown, the team will look to put together an entire 60 minutes of lacrosse without stepping off the gas. With moments of greatness on the field, there were individual efforts that stood out. In order to be successful against Brown and in the tough Ivy League, the young Crimson squad will have to string together four successful quarters.
“I love how our team has no quit, I mean you saw that against UVA in our first game. This was back and forth almost until the end, and I just love how our team, regardless of the score, is just bringing that energy. I think that that just speaks to us, so hopefully we can continue that drive in our lacrosse team this year,” DeGennaro said.
The men’s lacrosse team will travel on the road this weekend to face off against the Brown Bears at 1pm. The Game will be streamed live on ESPN+.
