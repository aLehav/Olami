After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BANGALORE, India—Being right is a feeling like no other.
I know this because past midnight, on June 12, 2010, 12-year-old me was the only Spanish football fan in a room full of assorted non-believers and Dutch supporters. The only reason I’d picked Spain—well before the tournament, thank you very much—was because my football-watching friend told me to, and I trusted her to at least know more than I did. Not that that was saying much. Thereafter, I stuck fiercely to my guns, maybe a little because of David Villa’s face. Can you blame me?
In the 116th minute, it paid off. Spain was crowned the FIFA champions. I had watched my little brother shed real tears when Argentina lost to Germany. After the Netherlands took down Uruguay, I had heard classmates tell me my team was going down. And in the end, little old me emerged unscathed. Dignity: intact.
People will tell you the upcoming men’s World Cup is about football. It isn’t, really, and I say this partly because I forget the offside rule sometimes but also because I believe it. No international sports event is about just the game. Especially at quadrennial tournaments, it’s about the host country’s weird national pride that often leads to flagrant spending and terrible debt. It’s about the glitter and glitz, and all the laborers who are overworked and underpaid to bring you that glitter and glitz. It’s about the plucky underdog (Iceland? Peru? Senegal? Take your pick) and the team that’s looking to become back-to-back champs.
It’s about the drama. The World Cup is sweeping, epic storytelling about legacies and stakes and stars—Lionel Messi! Alex Morgan!—and scandals and cover-ups. It’s a performance. And if you’re lucky, you’ll switch off the final and feel terribly, obnoxiously smug. I know that, given the chance, I plan to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Authorities on Friday arrested a man who allegedly threatened to bomb Harvard and shoot attendees of the University’s 2017 black Commencement, the United States attorney’s office announced Saturday.
Phoenix, Ariz. resident Nicholas Zuckerman, 24, faces two counts of transmitting in interstate and foreign commerce a threat to injure the person of another—and of singling out the people he threatened because of their “race and color,” according to the attorney’s office.
He will appear in federal court in Boston at a later date yet to be determined.
“On or about” May 13, 2017, Zuckerman allegedly commented on a post on Harvard’s Instagram account calling for “violence and death” at the University’s first-ever black Commencement, according to the attorney’s office. The ceremony for black students—held for the first time in late May 2017—is meant to celebrates black achievement across Harvard’s schools and acknowledges challenges that students of color may face at the University.
“If the blacks only ceremony happens, then I encourage violence and death at it,” Zuckerman allegedly wrote. “I’m thinking two automatics with extendo clips.”
That threatening post is not the only one Zuckerman allegedly wrote; he is also accused of commenting on another Harvard Instagram post on the same day.
“#bombharvard and end their pro-black agenda,” he allegedly commented.
Shortly after penning these comments, he commented “#bombharvard” on posts made by other users approximately 11 times over a period of four minutes, according to the U.S. attorney’s office.
Harvard learned of Zuckerman’s posts when “a concerned citizen” who saw them reported them to the Harvard University Police Department on May 13, the attorney’s office announced. The next day, a HUPD officer “viewed and documented” Zuckerman’s comments, according to Zuckerman’s indictment.
In an interview, Christina Sterling, spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston, said HUPD collaborated with federal authorities in the investigation that led to Zuckerman’s arrest. But she declined to share details.
“We don’t discuss how the investigation played out,” she said.
The University could continue working with federal authorities as it forges ahead with its efforts to prosecute Zuckerman, according to Sterling.
“Usually we collaborate frequently with local and state police in investigations like this,” she said.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to comment on the investigation or the prosecution.
The charge Zuckerman faces carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000. A federal district court judge will impose a sentence on Zuckerman if he is found guilty.
U.S. Senior District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf will oversee Zuckerman’s case.

Breaktime, a cafe that will be staffed by homeless youth and young adults, is set to open near Harvard Square this fall.
In addition to operating as an eatery, the establishment will offer vocational training, employment, and career mentorship to its employees, according to co-founders Connor Schoen ’21 and Tony Shu ’21. Schoen said that Breaktime has confirmed a location near Harvard, but the team is waiting to announce it to the public.
“Companies aren’t necessarily compassionate toward the challenges the homeless face,” Shu said. “Sometimes there is discrimination because of the stigma associated with homelessness, and some companies correlate homelessness with ability or trustworthiness.”
Breaktime will sell its own coffee, and will most likely be offering smoothies, cheesecakes, sandwiches, cookies and brownies, according to Schoen. The cafe will also be partnering with food vendors like Union Square Donuts.
The organization is also working to develop vocational training programs with nonprofit organizations and to start a career mentorship program with volunteers experienced in the professional world.
Shu said the revenue Breaktime generates will help support the organization’s employees and programming.
“We wanted to bring more attention to longer-term solutions to homelessness. One way to address that is through employment and training and mentorship and a supportive and loving network,” Shu said.
Shu said cafes are appealing because “a cafe is a place where the community comes together.”
“What we want to stay away from is isolating employees and purely branding ourselves as the homeless store,” Shu said.
Shu and Schoen said they came up with the idea for Breaktime after speaking with individuals staying at Y2Y, Harvard Square’s youth homeless shelter, earlier this year. These conversations led Shu and Schoen to realize how difficult it can be to find and keep a job while homeless.
The two then recruited a team of 10 to develop a website, write grant applications, fundraise, and forge connections with other nonprofit organizations.
“We’re calling it our Avengers consulting team,” Schoen said.
Schoen and Shu have also started a GoFundMe to cover opening costs and have raised over $3,800 to date.
“We have almost met our goal for initial grant money,” Schoen wrote in an email. “And we have offers for debt and equity investments for the gaps we can’t fill with grants.”
Looking back over the past few months, Schoen noted that, though Breaktime’s mission has stayed constant, the idea of the cafe itself has evolved.
“Today, there are a lot of things that look different, but our core mission and motto has remained the same all throughout,” Schoen said. “Particular ways of achieving that has changed, and Tony and I are still open to further changes down the line as we learn through this pilot store what works and what does not.”
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development reported in the 2017 iteration of its annual homelessness assessment that there were 17,565 homeless individuals in Massachusetts—and that 469 of these were unaccompanied youth under 25.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent College graduate Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18 recently co-founded a non-profit organization which plans to place 50 fellows in local government jobs by fall 2019 and train 50,000 new public service leaders by 2040.
The nonprofit, Lead for America, aims to promote public service by sponsoring recently graduated fellows to work for two years in local governments across the United States.
“The goal is to really cultivate the next generation of public service leaders,” co-founder Joe Nail, a recent University of North Carolina graduate, said.
This fall, the nonprofit will start recruiting in colleges including Harvard, Tufts, University of North Carolina, and Stanford.
Lead for America is currently working with staff and faculty at UNC to form partnerships with local governments in the region. The team plans to first place fellows into communities in North Carolina, before expanding to Massachusetts and other regions, according to co-founder Wylie Chang, a rising senior at Tufts University.
“We’re trying to stay in that area, North Carolina, because that’s where we currently have the most connections,” co-founder Shafer-Ray said.
Lead for America also hopes to eventually pioneer a hometown fellows program, in which the organization will help accepted fellows find public service opportunities in their hometown.
“A good portion of the most talented people aren’t going back to the places where they’re from and the places which would most benefit from their help,” Shafer-Ray said. “We’re hoping to really give students an opportunity to go home or go back to some community that really needs them and get rooted down there and really start helping the community grow.”
Nail said he began thinking of the idea for Lead for America in September, when he noticed that people interested in public service were applying for and accepting offers in the corporate sector.
“A lot of people who had been really dedicated to going back and serving where they grew up, or people who really insisted they wanted to work in policy or government or nonprofits or whatever—when push came to shove, they ended up applying for and accepting offers with investment banks or consulting firms,” Nail said.
Nail said the companies were able to promise greater financial compensation, skills training, and mentorship opportunities early on in the fall than organizations in the public service sector could.
Shafer-Ray noted a similar phenomon at Harvard. He said that he remembered talking with friends interested in public service last fall and hearing how they were “disappointed” at the limited opportunities offered during the College’s Public Service Recruitment Day compared to those offered during corporate recruiting events.
Co-founder Benya Kraus, a recent graduate of Tufts University, said she wanted to join the team because she believes that cities, towns, and counties have the ability to “step up” to meet global needs when nation-states fail to agree on solutions to issues.
“What really excited me is creating this movement, this coalition, this community of young people who are passionate about what local government can do, who are committed to being responsible for the communities they dedicate their hearts and their minds and their souls to,” Kraus said. “I think that’s what’s really going to build America up.”
