After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under the yellow glow of the Greenough common room, first-year students Anya Sesay ’25, Jetta Strayhorn ’25, and Toussaint Miller ’25 squeeze together onto a large couch opposite the door. The three explore various artistic forms while not in class — dabbling in everything from poetry and music to fiction writing and visual art — but are unified in their efforts to carve out an inclusive space for Black arts on Harvard’s primarily white campus.
After meeting each other during the typical freshman fall social rush, Sesay, Strayhorn, and Miller developed a tight-knit friendship. While relaxing in the Straus common space as Miller riffed on the piano — “As he does, with so much talent,” Sesay added — they reflected together on the immense amount of artistic talent held within the Black Harvard community.
“Black artists here have to exist in one idea of what art is — and often that’s white people’s idea of art… Black artists are not allowed to explore themselves or explore the medium as much as white artists have been allowed to for generations,” Strayhorn said.
Due to Harvard’s contentious comp processes and lack of diversity within established arts organizations, it can be difficult for Black students to break into the campus creative scene.
“There was a space that was lacking on campus for Black people to come together as a collective and create and appreciate art in a way that was healing and was empowering for us and for them.” Sesay said.
Founded last fall, their organization — the Black Arts Collective — aims to “allow all of Black artistry to exist without constraint,” Strayhorn said. Sourcing inspiration from the Black Power and Black Art Movements of the 1960s and 1970s, which emphasized empowerment and healing through collective creation, the Black Arts Collective plans to offer an opportunity to foster both community and creative expression. At meetings, they hope to work on art pieces for eventual display, share opportunities with one another, and build valuable friendships with like-minded individuals.
“We want it to exist as more than a moment and more than people producing things,” Sesay said. “We want it to be this space where there is a connection and that connection is formed through art, but it doesn’t exist in that vacuum.” While the collective is still in its infancy, it is quickly gaining traction. “It’s a big work in progress,” Miller said.
They have already begun seeking support and advice from faculty members Dr. Linda Chavers, Allston Burr Resident Dean of Winthrop House and lecturer within the African and African American studies department; Dell Hamilton, a curator at the Harvard Hutchins Center for African and African American Research; and Trymaine Lee, a former Fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
Now, they are in search of student organizers to head different artistic sectors — music, poetry, and editorial, for example — and find new talented Black students to join the collective. “It sounds like a pyramid scheme,” Miller laughed as Sesay and Strayhorn joined in. But to be successful, “It has to have community buy-in,” Miller said.
Beyond serving as a home for Black artists, the Black Arts Collective seeks to showcase members’ skills outside of meetings. “It’s also for the broader Harvard community that doesn’t understand the insane amount of talent that the Black community possesses, to be able to soak it up,” Miller said.
In the same way that Harvard’s huge Nigerian Student Association excites prospective applicants, the Black Arts Collective aspires to shape future students’ perspectives of campus. “I want the Black Arts Collective to be something that pulls people to Harvard,” Miller said.
Still, the three balance their hopes for the future of the organization with the slow realities of student-led movements. “A lot of what we’re doing is going to take more than four years …The hope is to build a big enough community before we go,” Strayhorn said. “We’re just trying to build a foundation,” Sesay added.
As a group, they are always on the lookout for new talent and members. As Miller said, “It’s truly a community effort.”

A new exhibition at the Boston Public Library’s Norman B. Leventhal Map & Education Center titled “More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape,” aims to explore the intersection between climate change and social justice, shifting the conversation about these two critical issues.
The exhibition, which is free to the public, opened on Friday, Mar. 18, at the Boston Public Library and runs through the end of the year. “More or Less in Common” approaches the vast issues of environmental and social justice locally, nationally, and globally. The show gives visitors the opportunity to visualize the climate crisis through historical and contemporary maps from the Leventhal Center’s collection, illuminating the inextricable relationship between environment and social inequality both in greater Boston and the world beyond.
President and Head Curator of the Leventhal Center Garrett Dash Nelson ‘09 expressed his hopes that the exhibition will change the way people think about the environment in a conversation with The Harvard Crimson.
“People still maintain in their minds this distinction between social issues and environmental issues, but there really is no way of maintaining that distinction when you really think hard about it,” Nelson said. “Where we choose to build schools, how people choose to get around to get their groceries, those are all both social justice and climate justice issues, and they deserve to be in the same conversation.”
The exhibition is part of the discussion and celebration of renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted’s 200th birthday. Olmsted, whose work shaped public spaces in Boston and other major cities, was an early figure of the environmental movement. “More or Less in Common” explores the role of these spaces and their intersection with modern social issues.
“We wanted to think about particularly the way that urban landscapes are designed and shaped and managed,” said Nelson. “That's a story that in some ways begins with attempts to change the shape of cities in the late 19th century, and runs all the way through contemporary climate change issues.”
“More or Less in Common” investigates the deep connection between social and environmental justice by delving into urban planning. A 1925 map from the Boston Parks Department showing underdeveloped areas and green spaces is superimposed with redlined neighborhoods, which were typically home to marginalized groups. These diverse working-class communities were often densely packed and separated from parks. The map is a reminder of the way the environment was and is used to enforce racism and social inequality.
“In almost any city in the United States, or even in the whole world, there's a really close correlation between where the rich and powerful communities are, and where the clean and healthy environments are,” Nelson said. “The people who are on the most exposed edges of climate change are also the ones who have been put on the exposed edges of society.”
The Leventhal Center created two of their own maps to add to the exhibition, synthesizing contemporary data into clear visuals. Their representation of vulnerable communities in the Greater Boston area is printed in large scale on the ground. This unique format and the eye-opening data it represents makes the map a particularly memorable and affecting aspect of the exhibition.
“This exhibition tries to take some of the massive amounts of data and analytic resources that are needed to understand a complicated question like climate change, and show how we might narrate that in a way that spurs political action,” Nelson said.
The exhibition concludes by showcasing projects from the Green New Deal Superstudio, an initiative which called for designers from around the country to create models of sustainable and inclusive landscapes and buildings. This ending is poignant — visitors are meant to leave with a sense of optimism, rather than hopelessness, in the face of these major issues.
“It’s not just this massive and impersonal climate system that’s inexorably changing,” Nelson expounded. “If people find new ways of organizing and articulating how a society and an economy ought to be run, then there are ways out.”
The examples of progress and challenges showcased in “More or Less in Common” highlight the vast community effort that will be necessary to face the climate crisis and social inequality. Importantly, the exhibition recognizes that institutions which guide much of the scientific discourse on the environment only make up a fraction of the population and economic system, and aims to change this.
“In order for that kind of discourse to really affect the way the world works, it needs to be something that everybody is talking about,” Nelson emphasized. “That's why I think work like exhibitions, and some of the work we're doing with digital exhibitions and trying to reach a broader public audience, is really crucial.”
The Leventhal Map & Education Center and its vast collection is open to all visitors for free at the Boston Public Library. “More or Less in Common: Environment and Justice in the Human Landscape” will be open until Dec. 28.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Mar. 23, the first night of the 2022 Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF), the auditorium of the Brattle Theater in Harvard Square periodically reverberated with frenzied, skin-crawling clicks. These were the feeding calls of “The Nest”’s monstrous and unusual villains, which are certainly reviled in the real world but rarely portrayed as an existential threat to humanity: cockroaches. But “The Nest”’s are not standard, shower-drain-in-River-West cockroaches; they’re bloodthirsty and lethal, the result of corporate experiments gone wrong on an idyllic island.
In the 1987 film, newly (and richly) restored by The American Genre Film Archive and Shout! Factory, the insects torment the eccentric residents of a beachside hamlet, forcing them to band together. The result is a delightfully revolting horror extravaganza that pokes fun at campy creature features by dialing up genre conventions to the extreme. The restoration will enthrall fans of lighthearted late-’80s movies and syrup-blood horror, with their self-indulgent melodrama and aesthetic flair.
From its opening moments, “The Nest” is a perfect specimen of the “creature features” boom in the ’80s and ’90s, immediately recalling flicks like “Alligator” and “Arachnophobia” that followed unfortunate townspeople fighting off mutant animals big and small. The film’s synth-inflected score twangs as “The Nest” introduces Richard Tarbell (Franc Luz), the sheriff of island town North Port. In an unabashedly heavy-handed moment of foreshadowing, he flicks a cockroach off his hand while getting ready, then spits out another after accidentally drinking it in his coffee. In these moments, as in the rest of the film, the movie’s malevolent pests aren’t particularly terror-inspiring, but viewers are constantly reminded of their unnerving agility and inexhaustible numbers.
Luz gives an endearing performance as the oblivious protagonist, who mainly serves to figure out plot developments too late and be lusted after by townspeople. In one telling moment of cluelessness, he pulls out his gun to fight back cockroaches infesting the local diner, as if that will get them all. But his character never feels like the heart of the film; it’s ultimately an ensemble movie, and its hilarious depiction of eccentric townspeople keeps audiences on their toes as the film cuts between different storylines. Many of the supporting characters heighten or defy the tropes of creature features. For example, the classic role of “expert exterminator” takes on new life in the form of Homer (Stephen Davies), a self-described “independent pest control agent” who rides around town on a motorcycle, spraying pesticide concoctions and accidentally burning down his house while dressed like today’s hipster twenty-somethings in relaxed Hawaiian shirts, pleated shorts, and clear-frame glasses. The bizarre Dr. Hubbard (Terri Treas), a disgraced researcher from MIT (a local!) who harbors a creepy fascination with cockroaches, brings unpredictability and anti-social malevolence to the stereotypical “conniving scientist” trope.
In this way, director Terrence H. Winkless places the film’s background cast of unusual, exaggerated, and archetype-transcending characters into a totally typical eighties horror narrative. “The Nest” unfolds like countless others as the unwitting townsfolk eventually realize the extent of the infestation, see many of their neighbors wiped out in comically dramatic attacks, then develop an elaborate plan to save their town at the last possible second. The film embraces its predictability but throws in minor twists for comedic effect, creating a rollicking ride that is both spectacle and satire. At one point, Richard, Homer, and Dr. Hubbard are fighting off a cockroach attack and realize they need to turn on the island’s lighthouse beam to halt the planned fumigation of the island, which would kill those who couldn’t evacuate. When Richard asks Homer to drive there while he stays to combat the roaches, Homer agrees, then mentions offhandedly “Oh, Sheriff, I don’t know how to drive a car!” So Richard has to drive him, his valiant last stand forgotten.
Throughout its 89-minute runtime, “The Nest” delights in elaborate, tittering death scenes in which unseen swarms of cockroaches devour people and pets, and the film almost makes a game of them. Each death is more dramatic and ridiculous than the last, drawing more laughs from the BUFF crowd and eschewing any real fear factor for the shocking fun of a man hemorrhaging fake blood after his fake arm is chewed off in hyper-speed. As the film goes on, it does introduce more moments of grotesque, stomach-turning insect frenzy — shots of toilet tanks teeming with hundreds of cockroaches can be nauseating — but the movie counters the effect by constantly re-emphasizing the humor in the premise. In one moment that prompted groaning laughter from the audience, a distracted teenager listening to ’80s rock on her Walkman headphones spills syrup from a tray of breakfast she’s bringing her mother, covering a carpeted staircase with sugar that immediately attracts the murderous bugs. As they eat her mother whole, the teen doesn’t notice her screams — her music is turned up too loud. Oh, the horror!
Ultimately, the new restoration is tongue-in-cheek, macabre gore at its best. The restoration highlights the film’s bright colors, sun-drenched scenery and softly fuzzy camera quality, reminiscent of a much-loved VHS tape one might find in a family member’s home or rental house, weathered by rewatches. Though it’s not very high-brow, it’s a creature feature fan’s dream with its escapist adventure, gorgeous ocean scenery, ironic theatrics, and ubiquitous eighties style. Even for those horror fans scared of cockroaches (like this beleaguered reporter), the film is a fun and hilarious watch, at once a time capsule to a distinct era of cheesy horror flicks and a tour through their hallmark conventions, tropes, and highlights.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has impacted artists in myriad ways. For the Ukraine-based team at Lighthouse Immersive — an innovative multimedia curation company — feelings of helplessness translated into an urgency to help the Ukrainian people through their platform. Only two weeks after the first bombs struck Kiev, they premiered the U.S. production of the Immersive Shevchenko: Soul Of Ukraine exhibit. With shows in Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Toronto, the exhibition had raised $150,000 before it even premiered. All of their proceeds will go to the National Bank of Ukraine and the Red Cross foundations.
Taras Shevchenko (March 9, 1814 – March 10, 1861) was a pioneer of Ukrainian nationalism in the fine arts. A jack of all trades, Shevchenko introduced his study of folklore to Ukrainian poetry, painting, or spiritual literature. Born into serfdom, Shevchenko remained, in some respects, a slave to the Russian Tsarist oppression throughout his life — although he was freed in 1838, Shevchenko’s artistic career would leave a target on his back for the rest of his life. His creativity reflected this; themes of Ukrainian liberation from Russian socio-political corruption became a Shevchenko trademark.
Although he lived as an exiled outcast, Shevchenko was immortalized through his art. His legacy is honored in places like the National Museum of Taras Shevchenko in Kiev, which works to preserve his works through events like the Nazi invasion in 1941, when workers of the museum hid away valuable art from German invadors. Now, almost one hundred years after Hitler’s invasion jeopardized the safety of the art preserved there, the exact same containers are being used to shield Shevchenko’s artwork from the invading Russian military forces.
The first Immersive Shevchenko show took place in the Ukrainian city of Odessa in August of 2021. Another modern symbol for Ukrainian spirit, President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, visited the exhibition before the war began. Working closely with developers Timur Polyansky and Dmytro Stus, Lighthouse Immersive Associate Producer Valeriy Kostyuk recruited Producer Natalia Delieva and Creative Director Tais Poda to share Ukrainian art and culture with audiences abroad.
The multi-sensory and all-encompassing Shevchenko exhibit accomplishes what it set out to do: translate the experience of Shevchenko’s vast oeuvre of masterpieces into the here and now in ways people all over the world can relate to and interact with. Between the effective surround-sound system, the dynamic lighting, and the expansive display, each aspect of the room is designed to envelop the gallery-goers and inspire their imagination.
Choreographed to the backdrop of Ukrainian choral music, the entire scene resonates with the emotionality of Shevchenko’s artwork.
Not only was it the technology that made the art move in realistic ways — clouds whirling with the wind, birds flying among them — even faces came to life with smiles and frowns. In this way, the audience could track the animated eye movements of figures like Bathsheba in Shevchenko’s painting “Bathsheba” or even gaze into the eyes of Shevchenko himself, in works like “Portrait de l'artiste.” As the leaves scatter around, sound effects of wind blowing invite the viewer to pace from corner to corner, engaging in the accessible mobility of the art around themself.
The beauty of the immersive exhibit is that the artwork circles the audience, making them the focal point. The result is that for the entirety of the 15-minute show, the exhibit entices all senses and transports the audience directly into the art. As soon as the lights dim and the paintings come to life, one feels as if Shevchenko himself is in the room.

On Saturday, the No.10 men’s lacrosse team (6-1, 2-0 Ivy League) secured its fifth straight victory with a 19-10 win against the Dartmouth Big Green, bumping its record in conference play to 2-0. Harvard played to honor the memory of Yeardley Love by partnering with organization One Love for the contest.
The win marked another strong showing for Ivy League men's lacrosse. Of the 7 men’s Ancient Eight lacrosse teams, 5 are ranked in the top 10 nationally. Harvard is the only Ivy League team to have an undefeated conference record.
Harvard did not come out of the gate as hot as it had in previous showings, trailing in the first quarter 5-2. The Crimson did not display its usual tight play, with the offense forcing shots and the defense miscommunicating through slides. However, the team shook off its nerves and subsequently picked up its pace to make the first half competitive with the Big Green, going into halftime with a 8-7 lead.
After the break, the squad returned to its higher caliber play and took control of the game. With this shift came more cohesion and communication, which was evident on the attacking end, where first-year attackman Sam King totaled nine points on the day with six goals and three assists. He was lethal from start to finish, facilitating play from behind, as well as taking one-on-one drives from the x. Junior attackman Hayden Cheek notched a goal and an assist, while senior attackman Austin Madronic put on a great showing with a hat trick and four ground balls.
In the midfield, there was standout play by junior Nick Loring, who sank three goals and facilitated Cheek in the second quarter with an assist, as well as sophomore attackman/middie Graham Blake, who added two goals.
“Unfortunately, we got off to a slow start but I thought we responded extremely well. I thought we did a good job clearing and riding this game which really helped us get more possessions on offense,” King stated.
In the first half, the game reflected this battle for possession time. Coming into play, scouts believed that the victor would be determined by the teams’ defenses, as both squads sport strong units on that end – Harvard’s defense ranks ninth nationally with 73 goals against (10.43 average), and Dartmouth is No.10 with 74 (10.57) – and that the winning team would be the one with tighter defensive sets. For the majority of play on Saturday, both the Crimson’s and the Big Green’s defenses held strong.
Sophomore LSM Greg Campisi was a standout, both on the face-off wings, as well as a member of the defensive sets. He tallied eight ground balls, which were crucial in ensuring that Harvard maintained possession off the face-off scrums and in the midfield. First-year defensive midfielder Andrew O’Berry also performed well. He was crucial in clearing the ball for transitions, and tallied a goal on a fast break.
“I felt that we did a really good job taking the first punch and not being fazed. We started off slow, but we competed really well and made the plays we needed to make throughout the game,” Campisi said.
Looking to build on its strong start to the season, Harvard will next welcome Colgate to Jordan Field on Saturday, April 2 at 1 p.m. The contest will be broadcast on ESPN+.

Harvard has yet to release updated sustainability goals after its previous University-wide plan lapsed in 2021.
The University’s first sustainability plan — announced in 2014 — spanned fiscal years 2015 through 2020, outlining goals for reductions in water usage, waste, and greenhouse gas emissions, among other targets. The plan set deadlines ranging between 2016 and 2020.
But two years after the deadlines timed out, the school hasn't released new objectives.
Heather A. Henriksen, managing director of Harvard's Office for Sustainability, wrote in an email that Harvard has continued operating under the first-generation plan, though nearly all the target dates it set have passed. Two longer-term goals were added to the plan in 2018 by then-University President Drew G. Faust, who committed to achieving fossil fuel-free campus operations.
“Harvard continues to make progress on the goals, standards, and commitments set in its sustainability plan and is on track to achieve its climate goals – to be fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel-free by 2050 – which were set in February 2018,” Henrikson wrote.
Harvard met most of its sustainability targets, but it fell short of its 2020 goal for reducing waste and water usage. Its campus greenhouse gas emissions have been flat for five straight years after a decrease over the previous decade.
The first-generation plan aimed to slash per capita waste in half by 2020 compared to a 2006 baseline. But in 2020, trash per-capita hit a 27 percent increase from 2006 numbers, which the University attributed to operational changes required by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Harvard also failed to achieve its goal of reducing water usage by 30 percent between 2006 and 2020, only meeting the target a year past the deadline when campus was de-densified. The most recent sustainability report pointed to the 14 percent cut in water use achieved by 2018 as “the most accurate” measure of Harvard’s progress.
With the trajectory of Harvard’s waste production and water usage uncertain following the return to full campus density in the fall, the school is without updated benchmarks.
Harvard’s 2020 sustainability report said that the Sustainability Plan Subcommittee of the school's Presidential Committee on Sustainability would publish the next generation plan “by 2022.”
Jody L. Freeman, co-chair of the subcommittee, wrote in an email that the team is still in the process of updating the plan.
“One of the things we are doing is consulting broadly so that we can take into consideration the views of the university’s many stakeholders,” she wrote.
Henrikson wrote that the Presidential Committee on Sustainability and the Harvard Office for Sustainability are seeking input from school affiliates and climate experts in drafting the updated plan.
“At the same time, it is important to know that the university has not somehow stopped working on sustainability. Harvard continues to make progress to meet and exceed the sustainability goals, standards, and commitments set in the original plan,” Freeman wrote.
Freeman pointed to the University’s establishment of the two new climate goals in 2018 as a “first step” that is already underway, but will be included in the second generation sustainability plan.

Harvard undergraduates seeking to transfer into a new upperclassman house learned their fates last month, when the College's Dean of Students Office released decisions for the fall interhouse transfer lottery.
More than 200 students applied to change houses in the first round of the fall interhouse transfer process, and roughly 40 percent were accepted, according to College spokesperson Aaron Goldman. Approved students are set to move into their new houses after the summer break.
In previous years, the DSO typically approved roughly 60 percent of applicants, per Goldman. Goldman attributed this round’s lower acceptance rate to an uptick in applicants and the freshman class’ unusually large size.
“This increase is not surprising, given the larger-than-usual overall class size. Due to the increase in the number of applications, the housing office was not able to approve as many applications as in previous years,” Goldman wrote in an email.
After living in their assigned upperclassman house for two semesters, students become eligible to apply to transfer to another of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman houses. Over the course of a school year, students may apply for interhouse transfer up to three times — one round that takes place in the fall and two that take place in the spring.
In all three rounds, students can choose to move alone or in a pair, often forcing them to leave behind blockmates if successful. Each student then ranks the houses they want to join in order of preference. If approved, they are required to transfer into the new house.
For both the most recent transfer round and last semester’s round, applications are considered as part of an “impartial lottery.” The transfer application does not consider reasons for transferring.
Applicants cited proximity to friends, classes, and Harvard Square as reasons for wanting to transfer.
Juliana Ruggieri ’23-24, a member of the women’s sailing team who transferred from Cabot House to Adams House, called the distance from the remote Radcliffe Quadrangle to the Charles River “super annoying.”
“It’s a huge time drain and really tough because our boathouse is three miles away from campus, but we leave from the river,” Ruggieri said.
Ian S. Kimbell ’23, a student in Pforzheimer House, applied to transfer to Kirkland House but was “bummed” when he got rejected in the first round of applications.
“I thought if I got accepted, I can hype it up a lot,” Kimbell said. “I can have this Ian Kimbell-themed holiday in Kirkland. It would be Ian Kimbell Day, and so that would be the day that my transfer acceptance was in.”
Students who applied to transfer during the fall said they have acclimated well to their new homes.
Omar Shareef ’23 said he transferred from Currier House to Winthrop House to be closer to friends living on the river, his classes, and restaurants in Harvard Square.
“Coming to the river has very drastically altered what my day-to-day looks like at Harvard,” he said. “It’s just kind of sad that there are people at Harvard who have a very different experience, just by virtue of the fact that they were put into a different house.”
Marlee K. Masters ’23 said her time living off-campus during the pandemic allowed for a smooth transition when she and a roommate transferred from Pforzheimer House to Winthrop House this spring.
“I wouldn’t say there was too much adjustment,” she said. “We didn’t live on campus our sophomore year. If we had that sophomore year in Pfoho, I would imagine that it would be a little bit more difficult to leave.”
Jamila R. O’Hara ’23, who moved from Cabot House to Quincy House, said that though the spring transfer round application was a “very simple form,” she wished the process had been more transparent.
“It’s a little shrouded in mystery how this whole thing works,” she said. “It feels like you’re kind of just sending an application into the void, and you don’t really know what factors that’s like depending on.”
“Say somebody just wants to, for example, go from the Quad to a River house or something, there’s not really any information about like, do some houses have more space than others?” O’Hara, who is a Crimson arts editor, added.
Goldman did not respond to student criticisms of the interhouse transfer process.
Unsuccessful applicants in the first round can apply again later this semester, when personal circumstances are considered. Students are notified of their results in the summer on a space-available basis determined by the number of students returning for the fall semester.

The Harvard Women’s Cabinet, a student group dedicated to addressing gender issues on campus, is aiming to partner with the Undergraduate Council on an initiative to centralize health care resources at the University.
Women’s Cabinet co-chairs Sawyer L. Taylor-Arnold ’23 and Jailene Ramos ’24 are spearheading the initiative, which seeks to improve access to health care for students from gender minority backgrounds. Taylor-Arnold and Ramos pointed to the University’s decentralized structure as a cause of confusion about what resources are available to students.
“We’re trying to figure out ways to centralize resources relating to health care, and health care services to make sure that students know where to access health care services on campus, like what’s available to them, what’s covered, how they can be reimbursed, and then also specifically thinking for services that are used by students who are gender minorities,” Taylor-Arnold said.
Ramos noted Harvard University Health Services offers Plan B for $15 and the school’s health care insurance covers transgender conversion therapy and hormone replacement therapies, but many students on campus are not aware of these services.
Taylor-Arnold and Ramos said they decided to begin the project by gathering information on student awareness of health care offerings.
“We want to know just how prevalent of an issue it is,” Ramos said. “Which is why we decided that our big project was going to be to create a survey because there is no data on campus.”
This survey, which will be sent out to all undergraduates, will be essential to decide the next steps of the Women’s Cabinet health care initiative, which may include creating a repository of available resources or issuing recommendations to HUHS, Taylor-Arnold said.
The cabinet plans to distribute its survey with the help of the Undergraduate Council. Travis A. Johnson ’24, representative of Winthrop House and chief of diversity, equity, and inclusion on the Council, is collaborating on the group’s initiative.
“It’s through him that we’re going to all work on this survey,” Ramos said. “Once we have the final product, we can send it out to the entire Harvard College campus.”
To plan out its initiative, Women’s Cabinet has divided itself into four committees: mental health; sexual, reproductive, and menstrual health; BGLTQ health care; and financial insurance.
“This specific initiative we have chosen about HUHS has a lot of groundwork that needs to be done, so the splitting of responsibilities and faith in other committees was a necessity,” Sidra Naheed ’23, a cabinet member on the Women’s Cabinet BGLTQ committee, wrote in an email.
The cabinet has also updated its membership policies ahead of the project. Previously open only to representatives from student organizations, the group now welcomes individual students to join.
Ramos and Taylor-Arnold said they value the contributions of all cabinet members to the launch of the health care initiative.
“We want it to be an equal place where everybody feels like they’re contributing and stuff like that and everybody’s doing good for the Harvard community,” said Ramos.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a drop in Covid-19 cases among undergraduates, Harvard College joined the rest of the University in relaxing its public health protocols, announcing loosened restrictions on social gatherings and decreased testing requirements in a Monday email.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences officially lifted its indoor mask mandate starting March 14 alongside the City of Cambridge, but the College held off on loosening other Covid-19 restrictions, including its limits on non-sponsored social gatherings, until the school could re-examine case counts after spring break.
As the majority of the University saw a drop in Covid-19 cases in early March, the College experienced a spike in its case count.
Covid-19 cases among College students have dropped significantly since the return from spring break, with 66 undergraduates testing positive for the virus during last week, compared to 342 positive cases in the first week of March.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in the Monday email that the required testing cadence for undergraduates will be reduced to once per week and non-sponsored social gatherings can resume in residential spaces. Undergraduates may elect to continue testing more than once per week.
While previous guidance “strongly” recommended masking in indoor public spaces within the College, the Monday announcement confirmed masks are optional across campus, excluding University buses and shuttles and indoor gatherings exceeding 250 people. Many instructors have also required mask-wearing in their classes.
Students who test positive for Covid-19 are still required to isolate for five days and mask for ten days.
The email also urged students to continue to mask if they felt more comfortable doing so and to be mindful of other students’ preferences.
“If you feel the need to continue to wear a mask for your own protection, or to protect someone close to you, you should do so,” the email stated. “As we adjust to this phase of the pandemic, please be thoughtful about your choices and mindful of others who may have different risk factors than you do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following sustained criticism from Undergraduate Council members, UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 formally apologized last Friday for using “defund” and “abolish” as slogans in their campaign calling for Harvard College's student government to be restructured and renamed.
Cheng and de Kanter vowed to “defund” and “abolish” the UC during their campaign to lead the body last fall, and they have continued using the slogans in the months since they were elected. But some Council members have called their language inappropriate given its roots with Black racial justice organizers.
The pair posted a video apology via a shared Instagram account.
“You have rightfully raised concerns about our use of the terms ‘defund’ and ‘abolish,’” Cheng said in the video.
“These are words that have been used and continue to be used by organizers — especially Black organizers,” de Kanter added. “It is not something to be taken lightly.”
The apology came just days before the start of a school-wide referendum vote on a proposed new constitution that would dismantle and replace the Council. Cheng spearheaded the effort to propose the new structure, deemed the “Harvard Undergraduate Association.”
In the video posted Friday, Cheng and de Kanter vowed to immediately stop using the words “defund” and “abolish” in favor of the word “reimagine.”
The anonymous Instagram account @harvardknowyourvote, which has taken aim at Cheng and the proposed new constitution in recent days, questioned the timing of the apology and called on students to boycott this week’s constitutional referendum.
“You are apologizing because it is politically convenient. Not because you care,” the caption of one post reads.
Maple Yard UC Representative Jada Pierre ’25, a longtime critic of Cheng’s use of the terms, said she appreciated the gesture, but added that it was long overdue.
“It took a really long time,” Pierre said. “But I’m glad he recognized the problem, and I’m so grateful because honestly accountability is all I asked for.”
Pierre expressed dissatisfaction with the delivery.
“That is one of the most disingenuous apologies that I have ever seen,” she said. “I don’t like how they fail to acknowledge that they dismissed this problem before.”
In response to criticisms of his apology, Cheng pointed to a portion of the video response where de Kanter addressed the timing.
“This message is overdue, and we apologize for that,” de Kanter said in the video, adding that he had been stuck out of the country due to a Covid-19 infection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I joined the Citizens’ Assembly, a body of Harvard students tasked with writing a new constitution for Harvard College’s student government, because I want our elected officials to better represent us. Under the Harvard Undergraduate Association, the system proposed to replace the Undergraduate Council, student government at Harvard would be reduced in size to nine elected officers tasked with advocating directly to the administration, complemented by a number of volunteers under officer direction. However, problems inherent to the structure of the Citizens’ Assembly have created a situation where the changes proposed in the new HUA constitution only worsen many of the current problems with the UC.
Improving a deeply flawed student government is a noble goal. It is one that should be pursued at length, not over the course of 11 short meetings by a body whose diversity is questionable. With the pressure of an impending deadline amid the ongoing challenges of academic life, there was not enough time for members of the Citizens’ Assembly to adequately learn about different forms of government before finalizing a replacement constitution. During the brainstorming period, only three members of the Citizens’ Assembly attended a Zoom briefing that had been set up with experts in the field of governance, and when the Citizens’ Assembly decided upon the form of governance to proceed with, after seriously considering just two structures, only 19 out of the 30 original members were present and voted.
The problems with the HUA are not the fault of any members of the Citizens’ Assembly; rather, they are the fault of naivety with regards to how long the process of developing a new student government would realistically take.
As a result of these limitations in the brainstorming process, the HUA fails to resolve the main flaws of the current UC. While a recent professional investigation cleared the UC of financial mismanagement, which was previously one of the primary allegations of its incompetence, the main remaining problem with the UC — representative in-fighting and resulting ineffectiveness — is not properly addressed by the proposed HUA.
UC members in-fight because they disagree over policy for valid reasons; however, these disagreements often become the focus of attention rather than the problem that students are trying to solve. This can create a destructive cycle that leads some to walk away from the UC and others to wish to replace the whole system.
The HUA does not limit this in-fighting; instead, its structure actually promotes conflict through the creation of territoriality. The HUA has a system of seven elected officers — led by two co-presidents — split into seven teams, each tasked with a somewhat different mission. This means that issues which don’t fall neatly into these seven categories are less likely to receive targeted attention.
For example, because important missions like diversity, equity, and inclusion are present in all aspects of student life represented by the Finance, Social Life, Extracurricular, Academic, Residential Life, and Sports Teams, responsibility to deal with these initiatives will be ultimately split, even if the proposed constitution attempts to confine them all to the Well-being Officer. DEI issues are abundant on campus, and I can foresee valid and substantial disagreement about which team is supposed to deal with problems that arise, not to mention the conflicting opinions that each of the nine individual officers may have on solutions.
In a worst-case scenario, the HUA could advocate to the Harvard administration up to eight conflicting solutions to one inter-team problem. While there are band-aid solutions to these types of conflicts, such as requiring all officers to vote on each’s activities, doing so would simply turn the HUA into a nine-person UC. As each officer is tasked with working within their own territory, and has their own discretionary budget, the HUA is a situation primed for the wasting of student time and money.
Under the HUA, each team also consists of a number of volunteers who can contribute their thoughts in advocating to the administration. However, these volunteers do not save the HUA from the dangers of giving too much authority to a small group of individuals, as the new constitution does not establish a minimum number of volunteers that must be present before a team’s decision is made. Worse still, as the HUA’s main guideline on transparency is “some records,” officers could largely avoid accountability to the student body.
The issues facing Harvard College — such as DEI, Shopping Week, and campus dining — do not fit neatly into the boxes of the HUA teams. By proposing a system of government which divides itself among these categories and gives ultimate authority to only nine officers, the HUA is set up to produce conflict that would do nothing to serve the interests of students.
Legitimate disagreement over policy is a fact of our student body, so any system of government must manage this disagreement internally. A government which cannot act in unity does not foster consensus or create a positive image. The HUA does nothing to systematically solve the issues of ineffectiveness within the UC. Rather, the HUA would bare its disagreements publicly to the Harvard administration through multiple competing policy proposals, making the consequences much more damaging to the student body.
If the members of the HUA all worked together in unity, then it would be an effective organization to advocate on behalf of the students — but if this kind of ideal harmony were even attainable, the UC would also effectively advocate on behalf of the students. Knowing this reality, we cannot evaluate the HUA with rose-colored glasses. While the UC is itself flawed, our current form of student government is clearly the lesser poison.

The Harvard Kennedy School announced it received a $5 million gift from the James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Foundation to establish a new program that will study wealth inequality on Monday.
The donation, which was announced hours before HKS’s annual Stone Lecture in Economic Inequality, seeks to bring together scholars to study and tackle economic disparities around the globe.
The Stone Program will consist of the Kennedy School’s previously-existing Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy, in addition to adding a group of doctoral students and more public programming.
HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in a press release the program will enable the Kennedy School to assemble “a critical mass of scholars” who will work on tackling wealth inequality.
“Income inequality and concentrated wealth can leave many people at economic and social disadvantage,” Elmendorf said. “Appropriate public policy to create a fairer economic system can provide economic opportunity and mobility for people currently deprived of such prospects.”
Maya Sen ’00, a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, will serve as the new program’s faculty director.
“The new Stone Program will position Harvard to be at the forefront of studying and researching inequality,” Sen said in the press release. “We are thrilled to be able to build on our existing strengths while also helping push the boundaries of research and scholarship with the exciting new opportunities afforded by the Stone Program.”
The announcement came before Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz delivered a lecture on wealth inequality at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum. It was the third event in a series of annual wealth inequality lectures financed by a previous donation from the Stone Foundation.
At the IOP event, Stiglitz underlined the importance of tackling economic inequality, explaining that the United States is one of the countries with the most inequality in the world.
“The United States has a distinction where we do everything bigger and better than other countries,” he said. “And one of the things we do bigger and better than other countries is inequality.”
“We have more inequality than other countries and actually, remarkably, less equality of opportunity than any other country,” he added. Part of that, he said, is a consequence of American economic policies.
Stiglitz, who served on the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration, said policymakers “underestimated the adverse inequality effects” of deindustrialization.
“We said we ought to have a more active policy on inequality, and we should be very careful about going ahead with trade liberalization and other forms of liberalization if we don’t have accompanying policies for retraining people and moving people to new jobs,” he said of a cohort of like-minded Clinton administration policymakers.
Stiglitz said he is concerned that rising inequality in the U.S. creates “a fertile field for populists.”
“The failure to address problems of inequality — including inequality associated with particular places and particular groups — does create a real problem,” he said.
Nevertheless, “the populists don’t have answers,” he said. “They prey on the discontent.”
According to Stiglitz, in the U.S., the Democratic Party is more closely aligned with labor interests.
“Concern about labor policy, about labor relations — you’re not going to find that in the other party,” he said, referring to the GOP. “You don’t have people saying we ought to have stronger unions.”
Former Massachusetts congressman Barney Frank ’61, who attended the lecture, said he hopes to be involved with the Stone Program.
“Diminishing inequality is the key, I believe, to re-establishing support for democracy,” Frank said.

The Harvard Graduate Council discussed the provision of financial support for events promoting cross-school interaction and the language on Harvard Extension School degrees at its meeting Monday.
Eight of Harvard’s graduate and professional schools were represented at the meeting, hosted at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, with some members joining via Zoom. The meeting began with a review of the current applications for funding through the One Harvard Catalyst Fund, which subsidizes approved graduate school events.
While the Harvard Business School Christian Fellowship, Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, and the HBS Middle East & North Africa Club all requested funds, discussion of funding applications evolved into more general discourse surrounding criteria for approval and the timeline for fulfilling those requests.
“In a very philosophical sense, the Harvard One Catalyst fund’s objective is are we supporting activities, events, initiatives that really bring the student body together in some capacity,” said Council President Peter M. S. Choi.
Some representatives questioned whether the Council should set requirements for event funding, including requiring that a minimum number of schools be in attendance at each event, and if retroactive funding should be permitted.
Harvard Kennedy School Representative Camille N. Choe noted that the Council had to reopen the HBS Christian Fellowship’s funding application and expressed concern over how delayed grant approval reflects on the Council.
“My challenge with this application is that it’s now been so long and I feel like it really does not reflect well on us as the body with the One Catalyst fund and being kind of a gatekeeper of funding, and kind of putting them in a tenuous position, because it’s kind of our fault the application is now retroactive,” Choe said.
The Council ultimately approved funding for the HBS Christian Fellowship, with the stipulation that the money be used either this year or next year. The Council also approved the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association’s funding request and voted to reconsider a previous financing request from the HBS Middle East & North Africa Club.
The Council also discussed the current language used in Harvard Extension School diplomas. Harvard Extension Student Association member Kody Christiansen asked the Council to support his bill, which seeks to remove the phrase “in extension studies” from HES degrees.
“I just think this is really important for the dignity of our students, and we represent the entire graduate student community who I think would very forcefully be in favor of this,” said Gabrielle “Gabe” L. Crofford, a Harvard Law School student, while expressing her support for the bill.
Ultimately, the Graduate Council voted to be a signatory on the bill.
Later in the meeting, the council approved a series of constitutional amendments that would increase the minimum number of voting representatives required from each school from one to two and set a maximum of four representatives according to the school’s enrollment.
The Council voted to conclude the meeting at 8:30 p.m., half an hour after it was scheduled to end, and ultimately failed to address half of their agenda items.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ultimate low-stakes, high-vitriol constitutional convention is coming to Harvard. This week, our peers will select their student government of choice via referendum — or, at least, their student government of choice from among two flawed, artificially limited alternatives.
On one hand, a deeply flawed constitution that has produced a dysfunctional, detached government rife with shallow social-media-based campaigns and unpopular enough to spark massive support for its abolition and those who’ve championed it. On the other, an extremely rushed, imperfect, and untested alternative in the shape of a Harvard Undergraduate Association.
We can’t, despite our long-held distaste for the current paradigm, support either. The new constitution isn’t good enough; its would-be predecessor is an outright mess. Our deeply-broken student government won’t be abolished more than once — and we can’t risk squandering our only shot at reform.
The current reform process, while aligned with our general desire to radically change the Undergraduate Council, was doomed from the start. It attempted to re-shape our student government through a process overseen by the student government itself, and hence imbued with its cutthroat toxicity. Any serious discussion of the merits of either document was, from day one, overshadowed by the antics surrounding the UC, ranging from the serious, like outright racist aggressions, to the infantile and petty, like locking leadership out of email accounts by changing passwords.
Amid an array of alleged threats, leaks, and attacks from UC proponents to other competitors and broadspread uncertainty among clubs about their future funding, we have grown weary of anything and everything linked to the incessant, Instagram-fueled drama.
The solution to the present chaos cannot be spun from and through its very fibers; it cannot take the form of a rushed document, drafted by a tiny sample of students, backed by an assembly mired by allegations of lackluster diversity.
The good news is it doesn’t have to be.
We need to go back to the drawing board — UC President Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who led an almost unprecedented, commendable effort to radically re-shape our government, must go back to the drawing board. In this redrafting process, it is important that we, the entire student body, are more involved. The well over 99 percent of students who were not a part of the citizens’ assembly should not be offering our input or critiques only after the referendum has been completed. Only then will we get an alternative we won’t feel forced to reject.
In the meantime, we can only offer our thoughts as to what this new government ought to look like. The caveat, of course, is that student government is plagued by a self-selecting, everyone-who-wants-to-run-is-exactly-who-we-would-seek-to-avoid problem. While systemic change can’t erase that completely, let alone guarantee a slate of laudable candidates, it can nudge us towards a healthier culture.
First, we would love to see House Committees play a bigger role in structuring our student government. They are, in our eyes, the perfect example of an on-campus institution that represents students’ interests and manages budgets effectively and quietly, devoid of the UC’s idiosyncratic theatrics. Their comparatively lower prestige has ensured that they attract people less predisposed to seek the center stage and more eager to put in the grunt work necessary to keep the wheels running. While there are some marginal disadvantages (the lack of freshmen representation, at least until after housing day, being top of the list) we would love to see an expanded role for House Committee members on the UC, perhaps even as representatives themselves.
That leads us to the question of representation and elections more broadly. We decisively back the HUA’s suggestion that we should directly elect specific roles like treasurer, giving them an added varnish of democratic legitimacy and promoting more policy-focused debate. Yet that need not come at the expense of a larger, more representative body — something the HUA would do away with, with its shift to only nine elected members.
Trying to find an effective constitution for a student body is difficult, to say the least. Harvard has a long, well-documented history of having a culture problem of students who choose to run for student office for all the wrong reasons, and peers who watch from the sidelines, eager to criticize but not to join a ticket themselves. We are plagued, internally, by a fast-paced culture that promotes success, power, and resume boosters over kind action. A culture that, for better or (usually) worse, defines those we elect to lead us.
We are not exempt from that; this is not just a UC problem. There are limits to what a constitution, any constitution, can change to fix this issue. But precisely because of that, we must be intentional and critical about the changes we seek to make, being careful that we don’t end up in square one, with none of the original momentum for reform. Until we’re offered an adequate alternative — until we get a seat at the table to help create that alternative — we cannot support the scramble to reform.

“Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr.” tells the story of one of the most influential rock bands of the ’80s and early ’90s: Dinosaur Jr. Music takes center stage in this film, conveying the band’s ups, downs, and everything in between. “Freakscene” doesn’t try to do too much and that’s largely why it’s successful. The film’s focused plot, supplemented with interviews and home-movie style videos of the band’s concerts, lets the story unfold in an engaging way for rock fans and outsiders alike.
From the band’s inception to its modern day presence, viewers are taken on a chronological journey through Dinosaur Jr.’s rise to the top of rock music and eventual fall. Highlighting the band’s evolving dynamics from their founding in Amherst, Massachusetts, and beyond, “Freakscene” explores male connection through the members’ shared passion of music. J Mascis, Murph, and Lou Barlow of Dinosaur Jr. were able to achieve great success despite the roadblocks in their way.
“They were communicating but not really, they were close but not touching,” said Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon, who toured with Dinosaur Jr. United by a shared passion for music creation, the trio played a role in establishing grunge, the early ’90s alternative rock genre that started in Seattle, but quickly spread elsewhere. Clips of old concerts, album cover art, and seemingly hand-drawn transitions create a dark aesthetic that feels authentic to the band’s musical identity. Attention-grabbing quotes like “You’re there to assault people,” by the band’s bassist, Lou Barlow, and stories of promoters banning Dinosaur Jr. from playing venues all contribute to the development of the band’s perspective on what their music should achieve in a shocking but engaging way.
The trio was dedicated to creating art, but that dedication eventually broke them.
“It never occurred to us that it was supposed to be fun,” Barlow said. The trio rarely celebrated their successes or congratulated themselves, generating a toxic environment in which they hated each other. Instead of dramatizing J, Murph, and Lou’s conflict, Reichenheim chooses to portray the situation as honestly as possible. Highlighting the nostalgia and maturity with which the band looks back on their issues instead of exaggerating the negativity felt all those years ago, “Freakscene” feels candid and complete.
The balance between present-day interviews and old-school footage of the band in their prime creates a cohesive narrative that unites the band’s past with its present. Delving briefly into problems the band encountered with the music industry, the film focuses not only on internal conflict but external conflict as well. Citing the recreation of popular sounds in copy-cat bands over a two-year period during the ’90s, the film gives a robust account of Dinosaur Jr.’s decline.
Footage of the band’s reunion in 2005 and subsequent tours cement this new chapter in Dinosaur Jr.’s history. Interviews with Barlow and Murph convey their excitement about the band’s future and the new mindset that they’ve gained with time away from playing music together. Though the trio’s priorities may have shifted, they still approach music creation with a heartfelt passion that can be felt in how they play today.
A fascinating look at the band that paved the way for rock music in the ’80s, “Freakscene: The Story of Dinosaur Jr.” achieves its goals with a balance of nostalgia and maturity. Grounded in Dinosaur Jr.'s music, the film is simple and effective, making it a captivating story of revival.

Avalon Fast’s “Honeycomb” successfully depicts the dark nature of friendship dynamics with an engaging plot, robust cinematography, and powerful score, despite a lack of poignant dialogue. Weaving drama in between subtle references to bees, “Honeycomb” exposes the dark side of revenge in friendship that viewers may not be ready to confront.
Fast’s feature debut brings us into the world of five girls tired of waiting around on boys to have fun. They decide to move into an abandoned house in the woods and leave behind their loved ones, upholding the self-imposed requirement of utmost secrecy about their location. To prevent chaos, the girls set rules for how to act in this new life they’re building for themselves, creating a well intentioned but ultimately grim set of standards.
The storyline of “Honeycomb” is one with exciting twists that take friendship drama to the extreme. As part of their rules for their new home, the girls allow themselves to provide “suitable damage” to anyone in the group who does something hurtful to one of them. A lackluster justice system with ambiguous parameters for what is “suitable,” this rule drives the story as its implementation exposes how quickly friendships can sting. Marrying the child-like fantasy of running away from civilization to a house in the woods with a group of friends with visceral violence, the film’s plot is shocking and even frustrating at times. It mirrors the reality of life, with unknown circumstances playing a larger role than expected. This ultimately leads to tragedy within the group, captivating the audience with the juxtaposition of innocence and gore.
Scenes of driving through the woods, sitting in sunny fields, and swimming in nearby streams make up the bulk of “Honeycomb,” though close up shots of calm characters with chaos in the background and flashes of violent images along with interview style scenes provide the depth that the script at times lacks. The characters’ dialogue often feels forced and rigid, at times taken beyond the point of a mere stylizing and instead feeling stale and lacking meaning. From conversations about makeovers and boy drama to staunch defenses of their rules and plans to enact them, the conversations the girls have seem to overemphasize the cult-like nature of the group’s search for meaning while providing little additional depth.
The film’s score is another driving force moving the narrative forward. Working with the plot, the music adds depth and interest where the dialogue falls flat. At times, the film seems pushed along by the eerie music and chaotic sounds in the background, an intentional and important choice for Fast which she revealed in a Q&A session after the screening of “Honeycomb.” Providing the contrast to the bright and sunny setting of “Honeycomb” that makes this film a psychological horror, the score and plot work together to convey the darkness of friendship and loss of innocence in isolation.
Living up to its bee-themed title, the psychological horror film “Honeycomb” meets its goal with subtle references to servitude, hives, and queens interspersed within depictions of violence, rituals, and betrayal. The girls search for freedom and authenticity in isolation from the surrounding town, but end up constrained by strict rules and the threat of severe physical retribution preventing any changes to their dynamic. In this “Lord of The Flies”-esque scenario, “Honeycomb” explores hierarchies within friendships. With no clear leader present, the film instead suggests that each character thinks of themselves as the “queen bee,” from Willow, who found the house, to Jules, who captivates the attention in their conversations. Fast shared that this ambiguity was intentional. Indeed, the cycle continued when a new member joined the house, having a similar mark on her neck to Millie, a nod to how beekeepers mark their queen bees.
Though “Honeycomb” is hindered at times by inflexible dialogue, its score and engaging plot successfully convey its message. Little character development occurs, but arguably, that’s not the point of the film. Delving into ritualistic horror and cult-like friendships, “Honeycomb” shows viewers the dangers of detachment from society in a futile pursuit of freedom, exposing how sweetness can unexpectedly sting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social media is all about bringing that which was previously reserved for professionals to the masses. An online dilettante can enjoy simultaneous avocations on platforms like Instagram, Medium, and TikTok, where blue checkmarks and easily gained large followings can lend authority to otherwise normal people. As the dangers of blindly trusting social media surface in public conversation, Yelp, a place whose content as many as 91 percent of people say they trust as much as a friend, seems immune to it all. That said, Yelp, where anyone can be a food critic, suffers from the same disinformation problem as more traditional social media, despite its stellar reputation. With restaurants’ reputations and restaurateurs’ livelihoods at stake, the question remains: How much should Yelp ratings really matter?
The stereotypes of food critics are distilled into the vampiric Anton Ego from Ratatouille: a nocturnal, wan figure whose sophisticated tastes, formidable standards, and caustic opinions stand to ruin the reputation of any urban chef. There are a few of the same characteristics in Pete Wells, the New York Times’ restaurant critic since 2012. His Twitter profile picture, the Muppet Statler, calls to mind the role of the cantankerous, unpleasable heckler (with a side of self-consciousness about Wells’ own position). The fact that Wells’ picture can be found hanging on the wall of many New York restaurant kitchens is a sign of the real fear he evokes in restaurateurs’ hearts. While Wells is no Ego in that he does not write mostly negative reviews, his most famous pieces include the sharp censure of Guy’s American Kitchen and Bar, owned by Guy Fieri, and the two-star downgrade of Thomas Keller’s restaurant Per Se in 2016. Wells’ stature in New York’s culinary world means his negative reviews carry particular weight to readers and restaurateurs alike.
It makes sense that professional food critics like Wells be professionally associated with their respective art form. Irish playwright Bernard Shaw famously wrote that a music critic of any merit “must have a cultivated taste for music; he must be a skilled writer; and he must be a practised critic.” A theater critic should have experience in the industry, writes Najla Said. Similarly, art critic Ana Finel Honigman writes that “for all critics, a pre-requisite for the role of judging the art of others should be a period of struggle in the studio.”
What qualifications are really necessary to be a food critic though? Most people in the world have extensive experience with both cooking and eating, some even practicing both crafts on an individual level three times a day. We are endowed with a built-in food critic in the form of a tongue and a brain that immediately passes judgment on every bite. Though many argue that art and music are indispensable to the human experience, food is indispensable to life. And while images of art and recordings of music are free online, there really is no such thing as a free lunch. Food uniquely sits at the intersection of entertainment and necessity, art and utility, luxury and subsistence. And because food’s gamut runs from near-inedible famine food to works of art from the finest dining experiences, and professional critics usually stick to the latter, Yelp is particularly useful for evaluating the vast majority of restaurants, which would otherwise go unnoticed.
Though it might appear to be something nobler, Yelp is still social media. And like all social media, it’s complicated, noisy, and regrettably vulnerable to bad actors. Yelp and others do what the Internet does best: dress the novice as an authority. You no longer have to be Pete Wells to be a published restaurant critic (though when finding places to review, even Wells uses Yelp). Any restaurant experience — good, bad, or routine — can be widely propagated online. The power bestowed on each individual diner is daunting to chefs and restaurant staff, whose livelihoods often depend on the success of their establishment. A Harvard Business School study in 2016 found that a one-star increase of a restaurant's overall rating on Yelp led to a five to nine percent increase in revenue.
That power is unsurprisingly sullied by those wishing to cheat the system. Falsified or misleading review tactics have plagued Yelp and other review platforms like UberEats, Grubhub, and Google from their onset. The buying and selling of fake reviews is prolific. Professional review writers around the world are easily hired online to direct readers to a business, either by writing positive reviews of their clients or negative reviews of their client’s competitors. Many companies, often with in-house reviewers, engage in “astroturfing,” or manipulative marketing campaigns that appear to show organic grassroots feedback from the public, but are really orchestrated by the company themselves.
Individuals often manipulate Yelp reviews for personal gain by leaving negative reviews in hopes that the business will give them special treatment to win back their favor. Restaurant owners who feel obligated to please every unhappy customer, especially with online ratings at stake, will often go to great lengths to appease a negative reviewer. Yelp has also recently fallen victim to politically-motivated spamming, in which groups of anti-vaxxers leave fake negative reviews en masse at establishments that require vaccine cards or passports. One particularly pernicious area of trouble is prejudiced reviewers who have little to say about the food and a lot of ad hominem attacks against the staff. Many chefs bemoan the disproportionate power Yelp bestows on customers, who chefs say often take their entitlement too far by making unreasonable requests, berating staff, and refusing to leave, all the while threatening a poor Yelp review. When Yelp ratings hold power over a business’ success, customers are empowered to blackmail them.
Though Yelp is adamant in their policies about ensuring trustworthy reviews float to the top, it takes little scrolling to find reviews of questionable integrity. Yelp’s algorithms are trained to sort out particularly suspect reviews, which are labeled “unrecommended” and do not affect a restaurant’s overall rating. As media companies are finding out, however, filtering out harmful content is no job for algorithms alone.
Everything is reviewed in 2022. Light Googling will show that the Indian Ocean is a 5-star alternative to the 3.4-star Arctic and Southern Oceans (too cold, most reviews helpfully point out). What is obviously fake to one reader may appear as gospel truth to another. What is needed is critical thinking about the criticism on Yelp. In an opinionated and unfair world, what’s written on Yelp might not be as it seems. When amateurs pose as professionals, when stars matter more than words, and when individuals are empowered to lie and cheat, high quality analysis is lost in the noise. While Yelp can be useful with good actors, the evils of social media have taken root there too. At the end of the day, maybe just try the restaurant yourself.

Lighting up The Sinclair in oranges, pinks, blues, and purples, English singer-songwriter Maisie Peters transformed the space into her very own bedroom — only with hundreds of people in it. Peters is celebrating the release of her debut album on a North American tour which began on March 1, 2022. From reading the signs fans held up, to listening to a fan’s heartbreak, to disclosing the “origin for all of her problems” and hating on Wordle, Peters made the concert feel like a girls’ night in, brimming with gossip, heartbreak stories, nostalgia for home, weird and current obsessions, and fun.
Peters sang most of the songs off of her debut studio album, “You Signed Up For This,” which debuted on Aug. 2021 and was the top selling album in UK independent record stores that week. The album was released under Ed Sheeran’s label, Gingerbread Man Records. A pop vocalist and songwriter, Peters first began releasing music in 2017 with her debut single “Places We Were Made.” She has since released two EPs in 2018 and 2019. Originally signed by Atlantic Records, Peters has been featured on the soundtrack of the film, “Birds of Prey,” as well as Apple TV+ Original Series “Trying” (for which she wrote the soundtrack album).
Before Peters took the stage, the first part of her Tour Diaries played on a projector in the back of the stage. In the video, Peters gets pancakes with friends, spins in front of Chicago’s bean, invites a waiter to her concert, and laughs with her friends on how a passerby thought she was Dua Lipa. This sets up the tone for the rest of the show. When “You Signed Up For This” started playing, Peters ran out to centerstage to sing the chorus, conducting her arms wildly and shaking her hair in a frenzy. When she asked the audience whose heart has been broken, and a fan explained her heartbreak, Peters called the fan’s ex a twat and dedicated “Sad Girl Summer” to the fan. Peters revealed to the audience that she’s looked through opening act Jonah Kagen’s Notes app in a display of her curiosity about what runs through the heads of men. These small, conversational moments, sprinkled between her primarily upbeat songs, invited the audience into moments of shout-from-the-rooftops freedom and collective “wishing someone would be the person they’d be in like 15 years time.”
Though Peters performed some of her more melancholy songs in the middle of her set like “Places We Were Made” and “Pretty Girls Love Star Signs” (an as yet unreleased track), the show ended with a blast as the audience chanted her name. The result was a warm sense of nostalgia, a lot of fun, and a bit of familiarity — Peters had pranced across the stage for an hour, stomped her feet, danced with her bandmates, and sang her heart out as if she were alone and singing into a hairbrush to nobody and everybody all at once.

With 25 best-selling novels and a Presidential Medal of Freedom, it is no secret that Isabel Allende is a literary tour de force. Her latest work, “Violeta,” gives her fans many of the hallmarks they have come to expect from the author: heart-wrenching but honest depictions of the Pinochet regime and complex, interwoven, endlessly interesting family dynamics. But that’s just the problem. Allende’s prolific abilities become repetitive in “Violeta,” ultimately producing a book that loses itself in monotonous historical scenes and rotating characters, and which fails to stand out in any specific way.
“Violeta” is a bildungsroman that follows the life of its eponymous character from birth until near-death, a period of 100 years. Violeta lives a thoroughly whirlwind life. She marries three different men, experiences the rise and fall of Chilean President Salvador Allende (Isabel Allende’s own godfather), the subsequent military Junta and its aftermath, and raises two children to adulthood. She also starts a housing materials empire, and lives a life of adventure and intrigue until she predicts she will die in 2020.
The challenge with a story that tracks one character through so many years is that the plot is necessarily as meandering as a life. There is no climax nor much rhythmic flow to the story, merely milestones in a long series of episodes. On top of that, the story is written as an account that Violeta is telling Camilo, her grandson and adopted son. The compounded plot-as-life and the feedback loop created by the main-character-as-narrator structure gives the story a didactic mood. Violeta appears to edit herself, inserting pithy aphorisms and bits of advice rather than lush description. This style, heavy with “telling” and light on the “showing” becomes exhausting as the reader endures literally one hundred years of Violeta’s thoughts.
A lot of buzz surrounding this book was due to the fact that it is one of the first books written during the coronavirus pandemic to include it as a historical event. This advance is somewhat misleading, as Covid-19 only appears at the very end of the story as a neat bookend for Violeta’s childhood in the aftermath of the Spanish Flu outbreak of the early 1920s. Over the course of her lifetime, Violeta lives through many important political and historical events, including pandemics, wars, and natural disasters. Ultimately, however, the mix of historical evidence and personal anecdotes are crudely blended, causing the narrative to fundamentally lack cohesion.
In the acknowledgements section of “Violeta,” Allende references Wikipedia as an invaluable source. The issue is that “Violeta” reads, at times, like an embellished Wikipedia page, taking well-known scenes of Chilean history and inserting random personal details that could plausibly be attributed to one of the many characters in this novel. For example, Violeta hears about a neighbor being abused by her husband and creates an entire foundation to support survivors of abuse that becomes nationally recognized. The reader never knows why Violeta is so moved by this neighbor’s story, nor how she created an entire foundation, nor does her apparent life’s work take more than a sidebar role in the overall narrative. The episode appears to exist only so that Allende can conveniently comment on bureaucratic corruption in Chile post-Pinochet. Or when Violeta’s daughter, Nieves, becomes embroiled with drugs and sex trafficking in Las Vegas, it feels more like a crude attempt to situate the timeline in the 1970s than meaningful plot development.
It is hard to categorize “Violeta” because, like much of Allende’s work, the scope is staggering. To address an entire life in 319 pages is a significant undertaking. Violeta herself also eludes definition. From a petulant child to a wise grandmother, the reader watches her develop as the decades pass. Allende doesn’t shy away from life’s more difficult moments, like when Violeta experiences multiple familial tragedies, and is liberal in her depiction of more private moments. Violeta is a sexual woman well into her old age, which is refreshing and empowering, but Allende’s liberalism can be contradictory and problematic. When Violeta speaks of her sexuality, it is mostly to explain her connection to the current man of her life; she only feels beautiful if a man desires her. The story’s token queer couple, Josephine Taylor and Teresa Rivas, seem to exist to merely appeal to audiences in 2022 rather than as a worthwhile story in their own right. Make no mistake, fiction written in 2022 does not need to be “liberal” or to have certain representation or morals or anything of the sort to be valuable. But at times, “Violeta” seems too preoccupied with appealing to a certain audience than telling a cohesive story.
Overall, “Violeta” is an impressive undertaking that combines a century of history into a relatively slim novel. However, a lack of narrative flow and its rote similarity to Allende’s other, more complicated works makes this book a step below the masterful literary fiction that made her famous.

Among the endless niches of TikTok lies a burgeoning phenomenon born of the boredom of quarantine: BookTok. Driven by a demographic of primarily young women and characterized by its partiality to emotion-eliciting novels, BookTok has grown from a small corner of creators sharing their recommendations to a notable online reading community.
BookTok serves an important role in that it centers readers and their preferences in an organic, grassroots-type structure. In theory, anyone can post their recommendations, and it is the community itself that decides what will be circulated on the platform and hence popularized. This type of democratization is not a novel idea, nor is it unique to TikTok, but it is still worth noting. Given the largely top-down flow of the book publishing industry, the growing influence of BookTok has the power to recenter the voices and values of the people that truly matter: readers.
Another invaluable aspect of BookTok is its ability to create a culture in which every type of reader and genre is valid. Too often, aging into adolescence and adulthood is perceived as aging out of the worlds of J.K. Rowling, John Green, Suzanne Collins, and Rick Riordan, and into the sphere of rational, serious, “intellectual” literature. It is made to seem that the only books that “grown-ups” read are classics, notable biographies, academic research novels, and the occasional self-help book. BookTok, on the other hand, removes the intellectualized perceptions of literature and instead welcomes genres that have been previously stigmatized back into the fold.
In fact, it is dominated by these categories, including young adult fiction, romance, and fantasy romance. The more emotion-evoking the book, the better. People want to lose themselves in what they read, and they want their heartstrings to be tugged! It is as simple as that. And it just so happens that these genres tend to deliver on these fronts. “These creators are unafraid to be open and emotional about the books that make them cry and sob or scream or become so angry they throw it across the room, and it becomes this very emotional 45-second video that people immediately connect with,” said Shannon Devito, Director of Books at Barnes and Noble, in an interview with the New York Times.
Essentially, BookTok reminds viewers that reading is supposed to be fun. It is meant to be a pleasurable hobby, not a space policed by the gatekeepers of “proper literature.” This point is especially salient given that the majority of young adults are experiencing the residual negative effects of high school English classes in which the appreciation of any semblance of storytelling is lost to the looming prospect of assessment. BookTok helps its viewers unlearn the practice of overanalyzing every piece of text in anticipation of a quiz, encouraging reading as a source of pure pleasure and enjoyment.
Of course, Booktok does have its flaws. One that comes to mind is what I like to call the “bookwagon effect,” in which select books receive so much praise they become elevated to the level of untouchable — sanctified, even. Inevitably, then, even an objectively good book cowers in the shadow of the unattainable expectations ascribed to it. One example of this is “They Both Die at the End” by Adam Silvera. In light of its target audience being a young adult demographic, this novel is by most standards a fantastic read. It fell victim, however, to the curse of the bookwagon. Through no fault of the author but rather due to constantly being advertised on BookTok with a lavish 5-star consensus, Silvera’s novel was found by many to be an underwhelming read.
BookTok also provides a crucial opening to increase representation of groups that have been historically underrepresented in mainstream conversations about literature. For instance, several novels that rank in the upper echelons of BookTok feature queer protagonists, including “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara, “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid, “Red, White, and Royal Blue” by Casey McQuiston, “The Song of Achilles” by Madeline Miller, and others. BookTok has experienced criticism, however, for its bias towards representation of gay men, bringing to mind allegations of lesbophobia and mlm (man-loving-man) fetishization. “One Last Stop,” for example, which was Casey McQuiston’s second novel after her “Red, White, and Royal Blue” debut, was noted by some for receiving less fanfare than its mlm predecessor.
Existing racial-ethnic diversity on BookTok also has room for improvement. The most prominent five-to-ten novels central to BookTok all tend to be quite white, both in terms of characters and authors; Taylor Jenkins Reid, Colleen Hoover, Madeline Miller, or Sally Rooney are all notable BookTok authors that come to mind. Furthermore, many content creators on BookTok tend to be white. Luckily, the nature of TikTok is such that it is quite easy to find BookTok sub-communities that can act as affinity groups, but these groups need not be limited to one identity. Diversity and inclusion of all underrepresented identities should be normalized in the BookTok mainstream, not just in the margins.
All things considered, however, BookTok should be considered a welcome addition to the social media landscape. Historically, trends led by or composed primarily of young women have been relegated to perceptions of mere “girlish faddom,” in which their merit is consistently doubted. Is BookTok perfect? No. Is it a bit embarrassing to be seen as a college student browsing the BookTok section at Barnes & Noble? Maybe a bit. BookTok, however, has proven that it is a force to be reckoned with, and that it should be taken seriously as a space of camaraderie, stress-free fun, and the revival of the appreciation of reading for many an ex-bookworm.

Susan Cain entered the literary world with strength and momentum when she published her book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking” in 2012. She shattered myths about what it means to be introverted and urged her readers to recognize that communities suffer when introverts are cast aside. Her work ignited a global conversation on communication, leadership, and how to value the quiet among us.
In her latest release, “Bittersweet,” Cain holds tight to that ambition and directly challenges a more deeply seated and culturally reinforced argument: Painful emotions are useless, shameful, and should be suppressed. Cain asserts that sorrow, longing, and grief allow for joy, love, compassion, and spiritual connection to be all the more meaningful. While this argument is moving, this book misses some crucial components of the conversation, diluting her claims in the process.
Cain uses her introduction as a much needed space to explain: What is bittersweetness? Cain defines it as “a tendency to states of longing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute awareness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy at the beauty of the world.” Employing a generous mix of case studies, personal anecdotes, and spiritual movements, she goes on to present chapters filled with examples of beauty spawned from embracing melancholy, and offers advice for how to move through loss, allow pain to inform leadership, and reckon with the inevitability of death.
This hodge-podge, though, of analytical paths keeps the book from being especially focused. Jumping from religious theory to social research to personal narrative and back again makes the book’s direction feel cyclical rather than forward-facing. The flowery, mystical language of religious and spiritual dogma stands in sharp contrast against the practical descriptions of leadership and communication development in the workplace, and it makes both of them harder to take seriously. All the thought avenues Cain explores are worth discussion, but in trying to do it at once, she risks drowning the most important ideas — and the reader — in a sea of theory, research, and memoir.
The manner in which Cain goes about presenting this mass of material to her reader, though, is commendable. The reading experience is both painful and cathartic as Cain, with a gentle hand, leads her readers down the intimidating path of more deeply considering their own emotional tendencies and well-being. The language is rarely convoluted or condescending, and Cain uses largely accessible research to support her ideas. She writes of well-known musicians, poets, and philosophers who embraced bittersweetness in their work and were all the better off for it. This book does a fabulous job of helping even the most unemotional reader connect the ideas of melancholy to the context of their own life. And ultimately, in facilitating this connection, it is the transformation from “pain into creativity, transcendence, and love” that Cain wants her readers to embrace.
The pain-to-creativity pipeline is well-documented; negative emotions often inspire great art. But Cain fails to acknowledge that sometimes pain, or more specifically, trauma are imposed upon people in sustained and unbearable ways. The creativity and transcendence described in this book are frequently occurring after distance has been created between the subject and the traumatic experiences. For many, though, there are social, economic, and racial factors that create a nearly constant state of traumatization. Bittersweetness is about the coexistence of light and dark and the ways in which this duality can be used to form more meaningful connections with other humans. But what happens when some humans force unnatural, man-made iterations of darkness into the lives of others?
The book never meaningfully addresses this conflict. Given its engagement with various realms of life and academia, this missing piece leaves a gaping hole: The practical, social, and historical implications of what it means to be sad.
Ultimately, “Bittersweet” achieves Cain’s goal: The reading experience forces her audience to consider that perhaps sorrow does serve a purpose, and that we should allow one another to welcome our negative emotions without judgment. The book is well-researched, well-written, and a necessary first step into an important conversation, but it is incomplete. It fails to acknowledge the way that social and economic forces often keep people in situations that make transforming past pain into creativity especially difficult. Sorrow cannot build bridges when it is intentionally and systematically perpetuated as a tool for subjugation and oppression.

When legendary quarterback Tom Brady announced his retirement from the NFL on Feb. 1, 2022, the sports community mourned. Brady’s career was incredibly successful, including 20 seasons with the New England Patriots and another two with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers throughout which he won seven Super Bowls. He is the all time leader in passing yards and touchdowns, with 84,520 and 624 respectively. Following his announcement, social media tributes came pouring in almost immediately, venerating the 44-year-old QB as “the GOAT” and making tributes to his 22 years in the NFL.
Yet, only 40 days later on March 13, 2022, Brady changed his mind. On Instagram he posted: “These past two months I have realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands. That time will come. But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. Without them, none of this is possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. We have unfinished business. LFG.”
This announcement sent social media into a tailspin. The post, which currently has 2.7 million likes on Instagram, released a shockwave through the sports community. Fans were thrilled, though the other NFL teams were not, mourning with GIFs and jokes alike.
But Brady’s unretirement isn’t completely unprecedented in professional sports. Michael Jordan retired three times; Magic Johnson, Rob Gronkowski, and Marshawn Lynch, all retired before returning a few years later. Considering the length of his career, perhaps Brady doesn’t know how to live life “in the stands,” as he said. It would be unimaginably difficult to abandon a professional career spanning half his life span.
Yet, he retired in the wake of his seventh Super Bowl, the most of any player in NFL history — it’s good to go out on a high, right? In ending his retirement early, Brady runs the risk of tarnishing his legacy. Brady’s performance in the coming season will be telling of how long he intends to stay in the game –– at 44, he is the oldest player in the NFL. But even with his age, few will ever come close to reaching Brady’s legacy.
While the career of a professional athlete is finite, Brady’s recommitment to the Buccaneers perhaps signals a new phase in his career: Plotting the path to the Super Bowl once more, but with more commitment than ever before. Brady’s presence in the NFL makes the sport better. He challenges the NFC and forces his opponents to rise to the next level. As the next season begins in September, Brady will once again begin the hunt for the Lombardi trophy; only time will tell whether or not he can secure it once more. Sometimes it takes walking away to realize the job isn’t done, and even with Brady’s age, would you bet against him?

In February, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science announced that they would not live-broadcast eight categories and acceptances during this year’s Academy Awards: Documentary Short, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Production Design, Animated Short, Live Action Short, Sound, and Score. The awards for these categories will be presented and recorded before the broadcast, then edited into the live broadcast for TV audiences to view. The decision comes after the 2021 Oscars produced an embarrassingly low viewership of under ten million viewers — the lowest numbers in the history of the Oscars — and an ultimatum from ABC to cut some awards or cancel the entire show.
The Academy presumably attempted to cut categories that thrill audiences the least. Then, are they suggesting audiences would have found “Encanto” equally enjoyable without music? Do they believe audiences would not have cared if Emma Stone kept her everyday hair and makeup in “Cruella”? Do they think audiences would have loved “Tick, Tick… Boom!” just as much if it were edited by an iMovie-loving middle-schooler? Oscars producer Will Parker addressed the issue, claiming that The Academy “values every last category, every last area,” yet his claims are incongruent with his plans. It may be more exciting for “Dune” fans to watch Timothée Chalamet walk across the stage than the set decorator (Zsuzsanna Sipos), but Sipos deserves her accolades. Viewers are forced to confront the question: What and who are the Oscars for?
The Oscars should be for celebrating and recognizing excellence in the film industry, and they should be for the people who participate in and contribute to the creation of films — but when all is said and done, the money is in the viewers and ratings. Consequently, the Oscars have become about wowing general audiences. In which case, it is easy to understand why Parker cut audiences’ least favorite categories, however disrespectful it may be to the nominees and to all artists who work in those areas.
The Academy is scrambling. Desperate for viewers, they introduced two new categories, #oscarsfanfavorite and #oscarscheermoment, in an attempt to engage fans by allowing them to vote online. It brings to mind the structure of the Nickelodeon’s Kids Choice Awards — and that seems kind of sad. Next, are they going to try to entertain viewers by ambushing Tom Holland with an onslaught of bright green slime?
Let’s face the truth: The Academy Awards can no longer impress general audiences. The streaming era means that the days of let’s-all-watch-the-same-show-at-the-same-time are gone. General audiences will not tune into a live show en masse. Also, no one has the time nor the attention span to watch a three-hour — sorry, this year, four-hour — television program. Apps like TikTok train the general public to require constant, consistent, instant gratification. If today’s young people are not laughing every seven seconds, they are bored, and the Academy Awards pass at a slug’s pace. The most entertaining elements of the show are the live performances, some of which will likely be accessible on YouTube for everyone to watch at their own convenience. The modern-day internet has rendered the live Oscars unappealing.
If there is any hope for the Oscars, it will be found by maintaining their purpose — and their dignity — by honoring every category to the fullest, including the ones that some viewers use as time to grab a snack. The Academy should stop chasing after audiences and start appreciating artists instead. Audiences run quickly. The Academy, lagging behind them, will find themselves stranded and lost. Well, that may be inevitable, but perhaps the Oscars should try to maintain some self respect in the process.

Sick of plain-old vanilla and age-old chocolate? New City Microcreamery's Cambridge location is complete with a variety of eclectic flavors. Founded in 2015, New City Microcreamery was even voted the Best Ice Cream in Massachusetts in 2018. This ice cream chain boasts a unique twist: products made with liquid nitrogen. After steeping and infusing their ice cream bases for 24 hours, the base is slowly mixed while liquid nitrogen is poured in to freeze it, a process intended to create a better texture. There are two additional locations in Hudson and Sudbury.
The Cambridge location offers an impressive array of 25 different flavors, from classics such as Vanilla and Cookies n’ Cream to novelty flavors such as Mocha Blanca Raspberry and Chocolate Almond Croissant. There are also dairy-free options available, such as Vegan Chocolate and Cherry Chip Sorbet. Brightly lit with a handful of tables and lightbulbs dangling from the ceiling and a red neon sign by its ice cream selection, the shop is charmingly vintage. With covers of ’70s and ’80s music playing in the background, diners can sit and enjoy their newly-frozen treats before they melt. The staff is friendly and welcoming, providing a generous number of samples from the impressive 25 flavors offered at the Cambridge location. New City Creamery offers normal sized scoops along with a slightly smaller “kiddie size.” One regular scoop is $5.25, while two are $7.75. Kiddie pricing is $4.25 and $6.75. Toppings, however, do cost an additional $1. Compared to other ice cream shops in the area that limit sampling ice cream flavors, the staff were particularly friendly and inviting, with constant smiles and more than happy to let customers taste-test.
Despite the glitz and glamor afforded by the liquid nitrogen process, the ice cream proved decidedly unremarkable and isn’t anything to write home about. The Peanut Butter Brownie, consisting of a peanut-butter based ice cream studded with small, brittle pieces of brownie and chocolate, lacked a strong peanut butter flavor, making for an unmemorable combination. Ruthless, a flavor with whole peanuts and chocolate flavoring from the classic BabyRuth™ halloween candy, brought on a childhood nostalgia unlike an ordinary ice cream flavor, yet the chocolate ice cream itself is overpoweringly sweet. Baklava, an ice cream with honey and cinnamon mixed with walnut strudel flaky phyllo dough that perfectly mimics the classic desert, did shine as a warm, spicy blend. However, others such as Don’t Be Salty, a sweet cream base with chocolate-covered potato chips and salted caramel, were cloyingly sweet and did not taste particularly different from a generic pint of salted caramel.
However, the greatest problems lay not with the flavor but the texture. Ice cream making heavily emphasizes precision and texture, and New City Microcreamery cites both in their process. Ice cream is ordinarily chilled and churned, and simply freezing the ice cream base would not produce its signature creamy texture. Chilling and churning prevents small “seed” crystals of water from attaching to each other, preventing the ice cream from getting grainy and diluted. Unfortunately, many of the New City Microcreamery’s flavors were unmistakably grainy and full of ice bits. Liquid nitrogen, which boils at -320F (-196C), is so cold that it freezes the ice cream base near instantaneously upon contact. This method is used since the flash freeze is supposedly so quick that water molecules cannot form large ice crystals, meaning that the blend of cream, sugar, and mix-ins produces a solid ice cream with microscopic ice crystals and an especially smooth texture. Yet curiously, three of the sampled flavors felt more akin to shaved ice than traditional ice cream. Lacking one of the main appeals of liquid nitrogen ice cream, New City Microcreamery is not particularly strong in either flavor or texture.
Ultimately, with other ice cream shops such as Toscanini's Ice Cream and Lizzy's Ice Cream just a minute away, the novelty of New City Microcreamery, despite its name’s suggestion, fades quickly.

Food halls have erupted in popularity over recent years as the foodie’s answer to deciding on just one restaurant to eat a meal. With a varied fare, these new age eateries bring together people and cuisines of all different backgrounds and walks of life while at the same time giving local restaurant start-ups the chance to launch their businesses in a casual low-rent setting or expand to a new area of a city. High Street Place is one of many food halls defining a new type of casual eating experience. Most of the first food halls that have popped up around Western Europe emphasized the individuality of each stall and the food; the hall itself is just a place to eat each vendor's food in what is usually a repurposed-industrial space. However, like many European culinary ideas and practices, the idea of a food hall has shifted towards higher volume and streamlined commercialization in America. Boston’s newest addition to this growing metropolitan fast-casual food scene, High Street Place Food Hall, is no different.
High Street Place Food Hall intended to open its doors in the spring of 2020, but like many others, had to re-evaluate in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the aid of a private donation from the Rockhill Property Management Group, the concept reoriented towards giving back to health care workers in the Boston medical community. An impressive 7,000 meals were distributed over the past two years before the food hall opened, introducing High Street through the support of the health and well-being of those fighting on the frontline of the pandemic.
Located in a historic art deco atrium, once a part of the city's thriving industrial manufacturing centers, the space itself balances breezy, open spaces and compact, bustling floor space. The south entrance opens into the more intimate side of the space, with vendors close to one another, reminiscent of street stalls in open air food markets. The strip of restaurants offers a selection of foods that is varied but not overwhelming, ranging from focaccia pizza to Italian gelato to hand-rolled sushi.
With a very intentional mix of small intimate spaces and large open areas, High Street Place encourages both exploration and comfort. The market vibrates with the frantic excitement of millennial consumerism. Most of the stalls have at least a few people in line, just enough to build anticipation, but not long enough to discourage curiosity. Housing 19 different stalls, the selection is varied without being overwhelming. Each stall is uniquely designed with a distinct and curated aesthetic, connecting the entire space and creating a cohesive and unified energy.
High Street Place’s offerings all proved tasty, fresh, and easy to mix and match. Haley Jane’s fried chicken sandwiches offers massive, crunchy, salty, pieces of fried chicken adorned with cold crunchy slaw all on top of a well-toasted potato bun. On the other side of the spectrum, North East of the Border provides a range of better-than-average tacos guaranteed to satisfy a New England taco eater's appetite. Add in healthy options and a coffee shop, post-workout class attendees and ravenously hungover Saturday brunch-goers alike are satisfied.
High Street Place fulfills its purpose incredibly successfully: to provide young professionals a space to not only engage in a different style of fast-casual dining but also stay for a while and soak up the ambiance. Massive, wall-sized TVs are perched adjacent to a green, plant-covered wall in the main open dining space. Separate from the rest of the winding, warm-lit stall space, the atrium is lined with a long, open bar and a cold seafood bar. A popular place to watch sports, High Street Place brings in its customers with a variety of food options and keeps them around with drinks and company.
High Street Place is in good company with the rest of the Boston area food hall scene. Similar to Time Out Market, High Street Place serves great food, in an environment that feels more like one is visiting, eating, and paying for the hall itself, not specifically the individual restaurants contained within it. The employees of each stall, while kind and accommodating, feel as though they work for the hall itself rather than each restaurant. What makes food halls so special is the unique collection of foods and culinary stories that are gathered together under one roof.
However, High Street Place underscores the experience of the hall as a whole — the ambiance, the drinks, the entertainment, the community. The clear collective ownership and management of High Street Place leaves the customer to feel like they’re ordering from different parts of the same menu when visiting different stalls. This difference, while likely successful as a business strategy, does indeed redefine how consumers interact with food halls, ditching artisanal family recipes in favor of a wide selection of IPAs and trendy selection of Instagrammable street-style meals. However, visitors don’t seem to mind, favoring the experience of the environment over anything else. This is a signal of changing structures and desires of consumers to lean back into a collective food experience. Bostonians don’t mind that farmers market-esque energy of other food halls is supplanted by an experience that instead favors being together. After almost two years of altogether unavailable or altered indoor dining, it's no surprise that young foodies simply want to experience a bustling, crowded, and vibrant environment.

On Feb. 27, an eager assembly of student groups, friends, and families migrated from Tremont Street to the Boch Center Shubert Theatre, where a revolutionary performance was set to unfold. Colombian dance company Sankofa Danzafro’s “Accommodating Lie” was not a conventional dance concert, but rather a novel exploration of the Black body.
A year following the group’s digital dance anthology “Black Voices Boston,” Sankofa Danzafro returned to an in-person venue to present “Accommodating Lie.” The piece, choreographed by the group’s Artistic Director Rafael Palacios, revisited and reimagined the existence of Black bodies by presenting Colombia’s slave trade and consequential seizure of Black identity through the struggle of Black Colombians. The performances ran from Feb. 26 to Feb. 27.
Throughout the performance, the stage remained nearly barren, save for three Colombian musicians and long rope-like raffia tendrils which hung from the rafters and reflected rich stage lights. In solos, pairs, and full-ensemble, the seven Afro-Colombian members of Sankofa Danzafro emerged from the curtains to dance. Alternating between contemplative movements and passionate bursts of energy, the dancers manipulated every inch of their bodies to synchronize them with complex Colombian drumming rhythms.
“As soon as I sat down and saw it, I was breathing [heavily],” said audience member Claudia A. Foxtree of the performance. “It was like my body was going through the motions. I knew I was sitting, but it was almost like when you see a rollercoaster on a video and you know you’re going to go down — your stomach is in your throat.”
Palacios, drawing from his own South American roots, choreographed a series of corporal vignettes in which the dancers literally and figuratively struggle against enslavement, racism, and the exotification of their figures. By sweeping the stage in rope-cuffed hands in order to wear the ropes themselves, Sankofa Danzafro shared a complicated history with observers. Audience member Elizabeth B. Hamlin felt she left the theater exposed to an unfamiliar history.
“You could feel the pain. You could feel the elation, You could feel the confusion. You could feel it all,” said Hamblin. “And when they slowed it down, you had to sit with it.”
Similarly, Foxtree found the nature of the group’s movement a compelling narrative device throughout the piece.
“The fast movements, the slow movements: It was very, at points, meditative. I was lost in the slow motion,” said Foxtree. “There were points where it felt like escape and fear and running. And then, there were pieces of letting go and performing, not that it was done happily at all.”
Along with energetic movement, “Accommodating Lie” placed emphasis on a forced cultural dimorphism. Dancers performed in exposing suits, rope-sewn clothing, or a combination of both. The three musicians, who often supplied their vocals to the production, performed a mock slave auction with dancers wearing suits of the ‘New World.’
“At the end of the last dance, one of the gentlemen, you could actually see his heart beating as how hard he was working through the suit,” said Hamblin. “You could see that conformity plus the contradiction.”
Natalie Syrion, an audience member with Puerto Rican roots, picked up on the blend of cultures on stage.
“I thought it was very, very deep. You could see the journey. You could see the auctioning,” said Syrion. “He also went in from the Latino perspective to go very deep into the spirituality.”
The word “sankofa” comes from the Akan people of West Africa and serves as the namesake of the group. “Sankofa”, in African tradition, represents the philosophy and spiritual nature of understanding the past to know the future. “Accommodating Lie” was presented not by linear storytelling but rather by an examination of various situations and stereotypes.
Napoleon Jones-Henderson, local visual artist and performer in “Black Voices Boston,” was in attendance at each performance that weekend, lauding the totality of the performance’s representation of identity and spirit.
“The truth is an extraordinary truth,” said Jones-Henderson “They really are about uplifting spiritually and aesthetically the whole sacrednicity [sic] of African people. To be able to absorb their energy and spirit for three days in a row was just extraordinary.”
Jones-Henderson also praised the accurate representation of African culture and “sankofa.”
“All the [music, dance, and costumes are] drawing upon the authenticity of African culture,” said Jones-Henderson. “The drums were a part of that. The clothing — the costume so to speak — were a part of that sound, the music, all of that is the voice of the spiritual world.
“Accommodating Lie” acts as the first installment of Celebrity Series of Boston’s project, “The Movement Series.” The second part of the series is Marc Bamuthi Joseph’s multimedia production, “The Just and the Blind” which runs from April 1 to April 2 at the Emerson Paramount Center. The final installment by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater will be presented at the Boch Center Wang Theater from April 28 to May 1.

With a surge in the popularity of true crime entertainment in recent years, one medium has solidified itself as the best source for the most dedicated fans: podcasts. With shows like “Serial,” “My Favorite Murder” and “Criminal” consistently garnering millions of listeners, television networks have now begun to delve into the genre. NBC’s “Dateline” was a predecessor to all of these podcasts, so when this new format presented itself, NBC seized the opportunity to release a slew of cross-promotional content. Thus “The Thing About Pam” podcast — which documented a single murder of a Missouri woman, Betsy Faria — was born in 2021.
Betsy Faria was a mother of two who was suffering from terminal cancer at the time of her death in 2011. Her husband, Russ Faria, was initially charged with her murder, but later exonerated due to unevaluated evidence. Pam Hupp, Betsy’s best friend at the time of her death, was fundamental to the case against Russ, but as of today, Hupp is currently awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to this very murder. In under a year, the six-episode podcast “The Thing About Pam” was adapted into a limited series of the same name, which premiered on March 8 starring Renée Zellweger as the titular Pam.
What differentiates “The Thing About Pam” from the pack is that it is not a case of whodunit. As a viewer, the “who” is spoiled by the title alone — the real mystery lies in the “why.” While we do not see the killing in the premiere, Pam’s guilt is the only reasonable conclusion, and how that guilt is discovered becomes the crux of the show.
The series opens with a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of Pam as a perfect suburban mom. She has a successful business, a beautiful family, and a perfectly manicured lawn. This polished image is instantly sinister, as we know something much darker lurks below. Unfortunately, this kind of surrealist imagery is not used consistently throughout the premiere, despite being a fun twist on the genre. Instead, much of the rest of the episode is dragged down by flat lighting and camerawork. With the concept of a shiny exterior masking a deep secret, the audience could create a much stronger connection to the unique story had these ideas been explored more visually.
Throughout the rest of the episode viewers see all the events that took place the day of Betsy’s (Katie Mixon) murder. Pam’s behavior is consistently odd and idiosyncratic, immediately raising suspicion in audiences. But where this suspicion is taken a step further, is in Pam’s later description of the day of Betsy’s death. When recounting these events to police, Pam changes many details, some as large as claiming Betsy and Russ’s relationship was abusive, and some as small as the time that Pam got home that night. This episode makes it clear that the crime was premeditated, so the question of “why” arises. What could justify planning and executing a plot to murder your ill best friend? Is it possible there is some motive that has yet to be revealed, or did Pam simply manufacture her own reason for murder?
Despite the show’s intriguing premise, the production choices of “The Thing About Pam” are generally disappointing. Reshooting scenes through Pam’s retelling of events is an interesting framing device, but the premiere’s inconsistent tone makes the episode feel flat. The visual style is more akin to a sitcom than a thriller, which doesn’t allow for significant emotional investment in its characters or story. Renée Zellweger delivers the only notable performance which comes off fairly stilted, though this appears to be intentional. However, the audience currently has no one’s perspective to follow except that of Pam herself, making it all the more difficult to watch this strange character on screen. Without a sense of her thought process or knowledge of the other players yet, the audience is left with no one to root for.
“The Thing About Pam” appears to capitalize on a current uptick in true crime mass media. While the show is full of intrigue, the visual aspects of its production falter. The show’s weekly releases may keep audiences invested, but the episodes themselves are unlikely to deliver the same suspense. The television adaptation will probably reach more viewers — but perhaps, in the end, “The Thing About Pam” works best as a podcast.

As promised by an opening scene in which a decrepit hatchback careens off-road through the Australian Outback so as to outmaneuver the 18-wheeler attempting to maul it, “The Tourist” will take you on a wild ride — so buckle up. The relentless twists and turns of this six-part series might result in some collateral damage, but the artful performances and macabre humor more than make up for a few plot holes along the way.
Originally released in the U.K. on New Year’s Day and available on HBO Max as of March 3, “The Tourist” follows an amnesiac (Jamie Dornan) who wakes up from a car crash to find himself at the center of a brutal manhunt. Incapable of recalling even basic knowledge about himself, The Man sets out on a desperate journey to piece together the mystery of who he is and why he’s in the middle of nowhere. As he traipses through the Outback with nothing but a Northern Irish accent and the clothes on his back, he finds friends in café waitress Luci Miller (Shalom Brune-Franklin) and Helen Chambers (Danielle Macdonald), the detective assigned to his case. But enemies lurk around every corner, and figuring out his true identity is made all the more difficult by the tenacious figures who, for some unknown reason, want him dead.
Viewers know just as much about The Man as he knows about himself, and the thrill of “The Tourist” is trying to solve the puzzle with him. As the episodes progress, each new revelation about The Man’s past raises more questions than it answers, and it quickly becomes clear that it’s not all pretty. Brothers Harry and Jack Williams, the show’s writers, have whipped up a jarring tale that often feels like one ongoing cliffhanger, with shocking discoveries that will keep viewers glued to the screen. Unfortunately, once everything has been presented, only a bit of scrutiny can easily expose the many inconsistencies in the finished narrative.
On top of some plot holes, the show also stumbles in its closeout. After a fantastically paced first half, the later chapters are comparatively overstuffed. This attempt to accomplish too much at once shows how “The Tourist” would have benefited from a simpler storyline that allowed for enough time to properly delve into the compelling plot points it often overlooks. Likewise, the script, which meditates on whether or not people can truly change, ends up stating its moral takeaway much too explicitly. Rather than letting the viewer grapple with the moral conundrum on their own, the concluding sequence borders on preaching while hitting its stance home.
In the end, however, “The Tourist” never actually falls to its shortcomings, buoyed by brilliant comedy and an exceptional performance from Dornan. The amnesiac antihero is nothing new, but the Williams brothers have taken a recycled trope and still managed to create a spectacle that appeases our inexhaustible appetite for fresh content. Part of this success is due to the genre-blending nature of the show. On top of electrifying action and genuinely touching moments of compassion — many of which are found in scenes shared with the warmhearted Helen Chambers — the series is simultaneously soaked in a subtly biting dark humor and the captivating ambiance of a classic Western.
The heavy content of “The Tourist” ultimately rests on the shoulders of its star, and Jamie Dornan bears the weight with artful skill. Dornan accomplishes the remarkably difficult task of capturing the nuances of a character whose tortured and complicated past exists only in his subconscious. Dornan is so effective that, as The Man learns more and more unsavory details about himself, it is difficult to choose where to place our own loyalties.
As the later episodes zoom out from a hyperfocus on The Man to a wider convoluted web of characters, the show loses its groove. Still, “The Tourist” is worth your time, even if just for its depiction of the Australian Outback, which takes on a role of its own. A fun mishmash of local oddballs and breathtaking wide-frame shots of the desert awash in a searing golden color palette are the finishing touches that complement the flashy car chases and staggering secrets of this ambitious show.

Seemingly out of nowhere, Paramount has announced that “Star Trek 4,” the latest installment in the iconic series, is finally happening, but roadblocks are still in the franchise’s way.
The Chris Pine Star Trek films have had a winding journey since their inception. The soft reboot (known as the “Alternate Original Series”) of the original show, which first aired in 1966, began with its first installment in 2009, reimagining the franchise’s main characters with some slight changes to the world around them. Jim Kirk’s (now played by Chris Pine) father has now heroically died on the day he was born in an attack by a Romulan ship, creating a divergent timeline for the events of “Star Trek.” The sequel “Star Trek: Into Darkness” was released after a long wait in 2013 to critical and box office acclaim, reimagining the events of fan-favorite 1982 film “Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan.” While 2016’s “Star Trek Beyond” had a positive critical and fan reception, it struggled at the box office, throwing hopes of a fourth sequel into the lurch. There have been intermittent rumors about a new installment since, but finally the franchise is moving forward.
Little is known about “Star Trek 4” so far — which still only has a working title — but there is a lot of exciting potential. Compared to the first two action-packed installments, “Beyond” was significantly more character driven. For example, Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban) spent significant screen time together for the first time in the film-verse — as characters rooted in logic and heart, respectively, their diametric opposition on moral issues and sarcastic quips make them a fan-favorite dynamic, so hopefully a new installment will continue in this vein. The J.J. Abrams films also introduced an onscreen romance between Spock and Uhura (Zoe Saldana): While Quinto and Saldana have excellent chemistry, their relationship has been underutilized beyond some dry tropes.
Anton Yelchin, who played Pavel Chekov, the 17-year-old Russian genius serving on the Enterprise, tragically passed away in 2016, and his absence will be felt in any new installment. Zoe Saldana, who plays Nyota Uhura, has said filming without him will be “bittersweet,” and while it’s unclear how this void will be filled, creator J. J. Abrams has said Chekov will not be recast. Chekov’s character was initially introduced to honor the fact that Russia made it to space before any other country, as well as to take an optimistic look at possible U.S.-Russia relations in the future. Especially considering current events and Russia’s heinous, widely condemned invasion of Ukraine, Star Trek’s vision of a future where humanity can be united in pursuit of art and science regardless of nation is more challenging and important than ever.
What is most surprising about this announcement is that it also surprised the cast. Paramount has reportedly given up negotiating leverage with its actors by jump-starting the announcement to fuel investor interest. Despite not having a finalized script or confirmation that the original actors will be back as Paramount has promised, filming is due to start by the end of the year. This could be a concerning sign if any of the actors are unable or unwilling to return, but hopefully the level of confidence means that the project will be given everything it needs to succeed. They are expected to have a massive budget, which is a great sign considering the high-concept sci-fi elements and amazingly complex makeup and costuming featured in past installments. (“Beyond” was also nominated for a Hair and Makeup Oscar.) If the right people are hired, “Star Trek 4” definitely has a great deal of potential to capture audience attention and fulfill fans’ hopes for further series development.

“The Batman” focuses on the titular superhero, played by Robert Pattinson, investigating and locating the Riddler — a barbarous serial killer intent on making political figures in Gotham pay for their unfulfilled promises. Along the way, however, Batman teams up with Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz) to discover the truth of the corruption in Gotham and the Wayne legacy. Yet another new Batman movie could have been an unoriginal iteration of a renowned hero; however, director Matt Reeves’ highly anticipated remake of the DC comics classic offers unique insights into the lore of the figure and should not be overlooked.
While the film speeds through the clarification of the characters’ backgrounds, it maintains momentum through eye-catching scenes. With its nearly three-hour runtime, “The Batman” is able to utilize engaging action sequences and intriguing mystery discoveries to keep watchers engaged. However, the film draws out the end of the plot much more than needed.
Notably, the dialogue in the film is lackluster, especially that of the characters surrounding Batman. This is most clearly seen through Lieutenant James Gordan (Jeffrey Wright), who either repeats exactly what is happening on screen or acts as a setup for whatever Batman needed to say. For instance, when Batman announces “Maybe this is all coming to an end,” Gordon simply sets up his next line by asking “What’s that.” Batman then replies with “The Batman.”
Where “The Batman” shines is in its outstanding cinematography, achieved through both idyllic images and strategic camera placement. Reflecting the dreary persona that protagonist Bruce Wayne emits, the film’s main color scheme relies on different shades of gray and black to provide a contrast with various pops of color. Most notably seen when the film pans over Gotham and the bat cave, the cinematography of the film accentuates images of brightness among the gray tones of the setting of Gotham. The strategic camera placement can be best seen at the end of the film where Batman is carrying an orange flare light and guiding survivors out of the flooded Gotham Square Garden. This shot illustrates the image of Batman as a savior figure and admirably bridged Batman's grim persona with his compassion for Gotham.
Though Reeves’s rendition of Batman remained consistent with several of its predecessors’ iconic features, he veered from the classic script by bringing a new villain to the big screen: the Riddler. The Riddler is a masked enemy of Batman that kills political figures of Gotham that failed to perform on their political promises and uses riddles and clues to hint at his identity. The masked assailant is captivatingly sinister — providing much-needed intrigue and conflict for the long film. While the Zodiac killer-like story could have been overdone, the villain’s intricate plans that build the foundation of the plot are well thought out and successful in both presenting the villain and displaying the strengths of Pattinson.
Fittingly, the film not only succeeds in the characterization of its villain, but Pattinson was surprisingly an excellent pick for the masked hero. From the first few shots of “The Batman,” watchers receive a different take on the hero: the distinctively emotional figure of the grim, dark Bruce Wayne. Pattison’s ominous performance coupled with the dark tones in the cinematography of the film is ultimately successful in setting the tone of the entire film with just a few shots at the beginning of his story.
Similar to Pattinson, Kravitz outperformed the expectations of a new Catwoman, shining as a powerful addition to the Batman team. Catwoman, known as Selina Kyle, is an expert thief who seeks revenge on her father Carmine Falcone for abandoning her during childhood after her mother was killed. Kyle teams up with Batman to unmask the truth from Falcone and his association with the Riddler. By including Catwoman in the film, the screenwriters added depth to the plot of the film — making the story not solely focused on the Wayne legacy, but how Catwoman’s history with dangerous men was able to help them identify the Riddler. Nevertheless, Batman and Catwoman’s inevitable romantic entanglements are rushed and awkward. Both figures have distinctive onscreen chemistry; however, their picturesque kiss on the top of a skyscraper overlooking Gotham was untimely in the plot of the film. Instead of building their relationship upon substantive romantic hints, the only clue watchers get into their future romantic feelings is Batman gazing over at Kyle for much of the movie.
“The Batman” fails to include exciting dialogue from characters and unsuccessfully integrates a romance between Batman and Catwoman in the film. Nevertheless, the film is ultimately successful through its exceptional cinematography and compelling characters. Reeves, by successfully introducing a compelling new face to the Batman franchise, adds new life to this classic hero. Despite its faults, “The Batman” is a must-see adaptation of the highest-grossing DC hero.

Everyone knows dating can be difficult; it seems like every other Tinder date is a near-horror story. But what would happen if you met the perfect partner, in a “normal way,” like at the grocery store? Would you be more trusting of their intentions? Director Mimi Cave answers this question in the funny, frighteningly dark, and sensual fever dream that is “Fresh.” Starring “Normal People”’s Daisy Edgar-Jones and “Pam and Tommy”’s Sebastian Stan, “Fresh” explores the social intricacies of modern dating through the tale of a cautious young woman, Noa, and her struggle to escape her new boyfriend’s unusual passion project. The intimate cinematography, uncomfortable close ups, and ironically light-hearted moments come together to craft a romantic comedy gone wrong, bolstered by the feminist commentary interwoven throughout the film. Cave toes the line of comedy and horror with a deft hand in her captivating first feature film, and she forcefully subverts the “rom-com” mold through a gruesome twist to illuminate the harsh reality of modern dating for women.
While the film’s first half is visually bright, replete with a comically bad first date and Noa’s gossip with her best friend, Mollie (Jonica T. Gibbs), the voyeuristic shots watching Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones) from behind a billboard or from inside her fridge are reminiscent of a genre more sinister and animalistic. The various closeups of chewing mouths, men eating, meat, and food are uncomfortably carnal, and undercut the sweet romantic charm of the first act. There’s a pervasive darkness that is antithetical to the original storyline, which while confusing at first, is all the more satisfying when the true nature of the story begins to unfold. The eerie hints sprinkled throughout the first act culminate in Steve (Sebastian Stan) kidnapping Noa, the true start of the film.
At this turning point, the predictable core of the film diverges in a deep straddle over horror and romance. Steve continues to pursue Noa, insisting that he likes her and that he’ll cook for her and make her life enjoyable. There are montages of him dancing around the kitchen, the cheerful and cheesy air guitar moves undercut by the violent reality of the film. Steve continues to behave as if he’s in a romance. He woos her, brings her magazines, and gives her thoughtful compliments that somehow seem genuine despite the manacles that enchain her wrists. Noa, on the other hand, settles into the role of a chillingly determined captive and crafts a plot to win her freedom. This contrast emphasizes the vast and unbridgeable divide between the way Noa and Steve, and perhaps men and women, view dating.
Stan’s easy-go-lucky Steve is arrogant, magnetic, and uncomfortably genuine despite the context of his character. His chemistry with Edgar-Jones is undeniable, and the film relies heavily on it to legitimize the tenuous and terrifying romance that forms between them. Yet, it’s Edgar-Jone’s heartfelt portrayal of a fracturing woman that makes the film truly shine. Her heartbreaking sobs of “I’m so fucking stupid” after she’s been kidnapped give audiences the first glimpse of the subverted reality of the rom-com genre. While she, like many women in many rom-coms before her, decides to take a risk in the chase for true love, the meet-cute is shattered by Steve’s true intentions. The chilling reality of the storyline is driven by Edgar-Jones’ dynamic performance, further strengthened by the true chemistry with her fellow victims, Penny (Andrea Bang) and Mollie.
Ultimately, the darkly ironic comedy and romance of the first two acts breaks to reveal the heartbreaking reality of the film as the women push toward freedom. While “Fresh” may be a comedy, its carefully plotted path through the plight of modern womanhood culminates in a partial victory, the exaggeration and animalistic cinematography giving way into a shocking reality. Crave emerges triumphant in crafting a story that is both entertaining and poignant, a touching portrait of women looking out for one another in a world that continues to be dominated by men.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Disclaimer: This piece is satirical in nature, and these students do not exist.)
This week, I decided to sit down with two disabled students to discuss their experiences at Harvard and what “living a disabled life” means to them.
First, I met with Stevie U. Smith, a senior in Lowell. Smith is the quintessential Harvard student: They started out studying History and Literature, but inevitably ended up an Economics concentrator, set to work at McKinsey in the fall.
Or at least they were, until “divine inspiration” struck.
“So, I was at this restaurant with my friends,” Smith said. “And when it came time to order, the waiter asked my friends what I wanted, instead of asking me, even though I was right there. That’s when it hit me: I have invisibility superpowers.”
Smith, a wheelchair user, attributes their superpowers to their disability.
“After that day, I kept noticing it happening. People talk about me like I’m not in the room, or if they do notice me, they talk to me in this weird sing-song baby voice. They can’t see me, so they must be talking to the crewmate plushies I keep in my chair,” Smith speculated, referring to the astronaut characters from the popular social deduction game Among Us.
Smith, a true Harvard Economics concentrator, is nothing if not opportunistic. When they realized they were invisible, they turned their newfound ability towards becoming the Harvard Among Us champion.
“No one ever suspects that I’m the impostor. Ever. It’s kinda sus.”
Smith’s invisibility always lets them escape accusations of being the murderer, effortlessly winning them game after game. Even Smith’s close friends, who are able to see them, never consider accusing them, because they are “just so pure, like an angel.”
“I mean, look at them,” one of Smith’s friends, who wished to remain anonymous, said. “They’re in a wheelchair. How could they be the impostor?”
Following these life-changing revelations, Smith has decided to switch their career.
“I’m training to become a spy for the CIA,” Smith boasted. “With my invisibility, I can infiltrate secret bases all impostor-like and just chill there, listening while supervillains monologue about their evil plans.”
This method is “an earth-shattering revolution in the intelligence field,” according to a CIA spokesperson. “Effective immediately, we’re laying off all of our non-disabled agents. Unfortunately, granting them necessary and reasonable accommodations such as camouflage equipment would burden our operations going forward.”
And Smith owes everything to their disability.
“I understand now. This is the reason I was born with a disability. The spark I lost after becoming an Econ major — it’s finally been rekindled. This is my calling in life.”
Next, I sat down with Justin A. Fukunaga, a first-year in Thayer. Fukunaga, who is blind, unexpectedly found himself becoming the founder of the start-up Ableism Can Be Fun (ACBF) this semester when he invented Ableism Bingo.
“The goal is simple: Pick someone to talk to, whip out your Ableism Bingo board, and see how fast they give you five in a row,” Fukunaga explained.
With spaces such as “told that you aren’t disabled,” “grabbed without consent,” and “called inspirational for living,” among many others, there’s an ableist option for everyone.
The central idea of Ableism Bingo is, unsurprisingly, that “ableism can be fun.”
“It all started one day in Annenberg. I was sitting with this guy. We’re talking about orchestras, and he asks me, ‘Do you know what a cello is?’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah… I know what a cello is…?’ He’d never ask that to anyone abled, but whatever. But then five minutes later, we’re talking about Korea, and he asks me, ‘Do you know what Korea is?’ And I’m like, ‘…Yep! Yep, I know what Korea is!’ And I hightail it out of there.”
(Author’s note: Satire aside, this conversation actually happened to me in Annenberg. It was not the best time.)
Afterwards, Fukunaga realized that if disabled people have to deal with feeling subhuman every day without anyone noticing, they should at least make the most of it.
“Here at ACBF, we recognize a core truth: abled people are weird. If we can’t get them to learn anything, we can at least laugh and practice our bingo speedruns.”
Ableism Bingo exploded into a global phenomenon, selling 20 million units worldwide. In response, Fukunaga expanded the game by adding customizable boards, including the popular d/Deaf, chronic pain, and ADHD editions.
All proceeds go towards improving Harvard’s accessibility.
“It’s a powerful emotional tug for consumers,” Fukunaga noted. “It’s like those charity commercials with cute puppies and sad music. People understand that Harvard can’t afford to fix its own accessibility. The cause resonates with them.”
With Fukunaga’s funding, Harvard is already installing an elevator in the PBHA building and developing fire evacuation protocols that don’t ask disabled students to shelter in place inside burning buildings in the hope that someone from the Operations Center will arrive.
Fukunaga is “proud” to see Harvard proactively responding to its disabled students’ concerns, he said.
“They’re going above and beyond, fixing all these decades-old civil rights violations for us. I feel like they really value us as people.”
And it’s all possible because of Ableism Bingo.
“Who would’ve thought the solution to our problems was for abled people to be abled people?” Fukunaga laughed.
Ben T. Elwy ’23 lives in Quincy House. His column “Living a Disabled Life” appears on alternate Tuesdays.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for “Turning Red.”
“I can’t be like this forever — my whole family would freak! Especially my mom… all her hopes and dreams are pinned on me.”
As she makes evident in this line, Meilin “Mei” Lee is nothing short of her mother Ming’s whole world. The tight-knit relationship between the two is undoubtedly at the center of “Turning Red,” a film which largely confronts how the connection between Mei and Ming changes as Mei prepares to enter her teen years. It quickly becomes clear, though, that this trope of strained familial relations pertaining to adolescence has been tackled all too often in pop culture. Pixar itself has told countless stories that grapple with the difficult dynamics of childhood — “Finding Nemo” follows the journey of an overprotective father; “Toy Story 3” explores the sense of finality that comes with going away to college; and the short film “Bao,” helmed by “Turning Red” director Domee Shi, is largely a metaphor conveying a mother’s reluctance to let her son grow up. What ultimately sets “Turning Red” apart is its unabashed confidence in a unique visual style. With excellent color symbolism, thoughtful anime-inspired facial expressions, and careful attention to its characters’ each and every movement, the clever visual techniques utilized in “Turning Red” make an already strong story truly great.
In many ways, the clever color contrast between Mei and Ming is what drives the story. As is foreshadowed early in the film, Mei’s central conflict arises when she is troubled by an ancestral condition that turns her into a gigantic red panda every time she displays too much emotion. While the volatile panda can be easily drawn up as a metaphor for the uncontrollable nature of puberty and the development of personal identity, the color usage in “Turning Red” continually makes this metaphor far more intriguing. Even before Mei first turns into the panda, the fiery, unkempt essence of this beast is heavily implied to represent who she is as a person, as she dresses in red and exhibits a flashy and shameless tween personality.
Mei’s color scheme is directly juxtaposed with that of Ming, whose wardrobe of mint and emerald greens represents the orderly, principled environment Mei has grown up in. Fittingly, Mei’s bedroom is predominantly green, showing just how curated her childhood experience has been. Mei also wears a green pin in her hair throughout much of the film, preserving a certain sense of tidiness and demonstrating that Ming’s desires are literally “pinned” on her, as Mei directly says.
The strongest implication of the film’s color contrast comes near the end, when Ming, in a fit of rage, morphs into her own version of the red panda she encountered in her childhood. What’s different about Ming’s panda, though, is that it is hundreds of times larger than Mei’s, communicating that keeping one’s emotions pent up makes them all the more difficult to manage when they are finally unleashed.
The frequent depiction of unfiltered emotion in the film is captured beautifully by a stylish, anime-inspired handling of facial expressions. Every intense emotion is exaggerated by a particular focus on the appearance of a character’s eyes. For instance, characters’ pupils are extremely tiny when they are scared, as is particularly evident during the scene in which Mei first turns into the panda and proceeds to scream at Ming; her pupils immediately shrink to a near-invisible size, craftily demonstrating just how much she fears Ming’s reaction. By contrast, a character’s pupils are often massive and swelling with tears when they look at something they love, as is showcased when Mei gushes over a cute boy in the hallway at school. Beyond just revealing emotion, though, the unique facial expressions are often used as an operative tool to reveal less obvious facets of a character. For instance, though Ming’s pupils characteristically appear normal throughout much of the film, they shrink to become incredibly tiny when she is on the phone with her own mother, peeling back an unforeseen layer of her oft-composed persona.
The film’s confidence in its style is perhaps most evident in the ways its characters move, as the bond between characters is often exhibited in the synchronicity of their motions. This coherence is encapsulated in one sequence during which Mei and Ming clean their family’s temple and host guests; they move in the exact same way as they sweep the floor and, once their guests leave, lean against opposite sides of the door and wipe the sweat from their foreheads in perfect symmetry. In a similar fashion, Mei’s motions are also perfectly in sync with those of her three best friends: in a scene during which the four admire a boy they think is cute, they all peek out from behind a wall at the same time, four heads vertically stacked atop one another. Similar to with the exaggerated facial expressions, the film’s focus on movement is both independently robust and has larger narrative implications. Mei’s synchronous movement with both Ming and her friends represents the idea that she has strong ties to each, and that she is at a point in her life where she often has to choose between the two.
The best attribute of “Turning Red” is that it isn’t visually appealing just for the sake of it. While the story and visual style are both independently strong, the film’s ability to use its visuals to seamlessly build upon its plot is what really makes it excel — the result is something very different from anything Pixar has done before. By the end of the film, Mei is able to stay true to her burgeoning identity while also making peace with the transformed nature of her relationship with Ming. Still, when Ming questions Mei’s decision to go out in public with some of her panda features visible, Mei responds by saying, “My panda, my choice, Mom!” It ultimately seems that some small kinks will remain in the relationship between the two, and that matters between parent and child aren’t totally resolved — but are they ever?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early December last year, composer, world-class saxophonist, and jazz musician Don Braden ‘85 directed The Harvard Jazz Combo Initiative’s Jazz & Java Cafe performance in Leverett House. Unbeknownst to many in the audience, the performance occurring that night was the culmination of over 40 years of “the universe at work,” in the words of Braden himself.
Many of the core experiences that Braden relayed during a conversation with The Crimson led him right back to where he began at Harvard: jazz. It all started in the ’70s in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.
“I remember how hot it was, it was the summer, my feet were burning through my shoes, I still remember that feeling. I was 15 years old and my feet were so hot that I almost couldn’t stand on the stage,” Braden said.
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio but raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Braden grew up surrounded by the ’60s and ’70s music of his parents and Black neighborhood. Being involved in music from a young age as well as having the opportunity to play in a variety of bands all added to the momentum that led him into a life-long career in jazz.
After playing sunny stages at The Belvedere in Louisville and discovering a proclivity for tenor saxophone in his school band, Braden was prompted to apply to Harvard University by a school friend, Drew Chuppe. So, he did — and he got in.
“My freshman roommate was Leon Gruenbaum who was, actually, quite an excellent jazz pianist. So from the get-go, we were playing together and used to play all kinds of things around Harvard as a duo. Don & Leon. The universe put us together and to this day we have a fruitful relationship,” said Braden.
“My sophomore year, Leon and I were playing somewhere and this kid comes in, Jill Suttenberg,” Braden continued.
Jill Suttenberg ‘87 was all set to go to Yale but happened to be visiting Harvard just to make sure she covered all of her options. It was on this visit that she saw the Don & Leon tag-team playing on campus and was introduced to Harvard’s jazz scene and, most importantly, band director Thomas G. Everett.
“Getting into Harvard was definitely the perfect thing for my music, and the reason why is because — well it’s two reasons. Harvard, in Boston, had a healthy jazz scene at the time, and it’s still pretty good. At the time, Tom Everett, who was the director of bands when I was there, was a big jazz guy. He brought all kinds of jazz luminaries into Harvard on a regular basis,” Brady said.
The Crimson soon came to find out that Suttenberg’s feelings toward music at Harvard were equally as amicable. She ended up enrolling in Harvard instead of Yale. The stars aligned such that Braden would make another friendship his sophomore year that would help propel his music career and opportunities.
“In my sophomore year, a guy came in, alto player, Sasha Lewis. Sasha Lewis, as it turns out, was the son of the great John Lewis, the pianist from the Modern Jazz Quartet. His son came to Harvard. So we became great friends. [Sasha] was the one who took me on my early trips to New York and I stayed with John Lewis in his house. We used to just talk about jazz and music and life and it was great. John Lewis actually found me my first apartment in New York when I took my year off from Harvard, which turned into 40,” Braden said.
Today, Braden performs regularly in New York City at a handful of venues but travels extensively for music gigs. He has ventured as far as Japan and even the Netherlands to perform with fellow New York City musicians and teach music. Since leaving Harvard to further pursue a music career, Braden has formed two main bands: Big Fun’k and the Don Braden Quartet.
“So all the incredible gigs and things that happened since then all were because of John Lewis basically finding me a good place to live and helping me out. Sasha and I, that was a Harvard connection. He’s class of ‘86 and I’m class of ‘85 and then class of ‘87 is Jill,” Braden said.
“So fast forward to about five years ago, [Suttenberg] gets married, she gets her masters and marries [David Matthew Altshuler] and he gets a doctorate and they’re a power couple and they build a whole bunch of money and they give a chunk of money to Harvard because she was so inspired by her time at Harvard, particularly by Tom Everett. She gave money and created something called the [Thomas] G. Everett Jazz Innovation Fund and this is 30 years later, just 5 years ago,” Braden said.
In the meantime, band director Tom Everett called Braden to inform him that he was retiring and wanted to know if Braden could direct the band in the interim. Braden, of course, agreed and ran the Harvard Jazz Band for three years before the current director, Yosvany Terry, was hired. It was Terry who eventually called Braden with the suggestion that would bring his jazz life at Harvard full circle. Braden said, “Yosvany called me and said ‘Connect with Jill for the combo program.’”
About three years ago, after that phone call, Braden sat down for a dinner with Suttenberg, who presented Braden with the concept of starting up a combo initiative using the Innovation Fund.
Braden said, “We had a big band at Harvard but there is a lot of people who can’t fit in the big band because of the configuration. You can’t put a lot of bodies in it. But if you run a combo program you can take everybody and just figure out how to get them all together. [Suttenberg] said, ‘If you do this, this fund will pay for it.’ So we did it. So what I did three nights ago was the final concert for this Jazz Combo Initiative which came out of this fund that she paid for from hearing me and the students.”
Braden emphasized the inclusivity and openness of the combo initiative, the main goal of which is to develop the talents of Harvard undergraduate students interested in jazz at all musical levels. In both the fall and spring semester performances, the students are given opportunities to showcase their refined talents in an atmosphere that would have otherwise not been available to them due to the inflexibility of other musical groups on campus.
With the Harvard Jazz Combo Initiative having just finished their routine fall semester performance and preparing for their spring performance on April 19, Braden said, “Coming full circle now to this, or coming — whatever the path, it’s not circular — kinda this crazy path to last night where the kids get to present their concert. There are so many intertwining stories with that and it’s just super cool. I’m really glad to be at Harvard, number one, and really gratified to see all the connections that have grown from those seeds of those undergraduate years and ultimately share it with the students in a very productive and inspiring way.”
So, if Drew never told Don to apply to Harvard, Don & Leon would have never convinced Jill to come to Harvard, play in the band under Tom Everett, and create the Thomas C. Everett Innovation Fund that funds the Jazz Combo Initiative for which Braden just finished directing a performance at Harvard 40 or so years later. As Braden said, “Here is the universe at work.”

Starting her career in the sensational but now-defunct girl group Fifth Harmony, Normani has made her own name collaborating with A-list artists from Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj to Sam Smith and Megan Thee Stallion. Her latest single, “Fair,” which was released on March 18, is one of only two solo tracks released by the singer (following 2019’s “Motivation”). “Fair” reflects this lack of solo experience and conveys all the hesitancy of an artist who has yet to assert herself as a stand-alone star.
Fittingly, “Fair” is a song about insecurity. Over a soft beat and an ambiguous, piano-like instrument, Normani not only pines for her ex, but expresses frustration with his growth post-breakup as compared to her stagnancy and continued heartbreak. Singing, “Is it right that you’ve grown / And I’m still stuck in habits? / ‘Cause I’m finding it strange / That you’re better than average,” Normani ruefully captures the pain of loss and the unique humiliation of watching a person blossom without you. But these are brief moments of eloquence in a track repeatedly marked by auto-tuned, nonverbal crooning, as if Normani and co-writers Abby Keen, Bernard “HARV” Harvey, and Felisha King Harvey had nothing left to say to fill the three-plus minutes of synth.
Considering the vocalist “Fair” is written for, the frequent crooning becomes even more cumbersome. From her debut performance of the track on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” it’s clear that the single was meant to be Normani’s foray into diva-dom: she stands unaccompanied at a microphone with wind blowing in her hair à la Beyoncé or Celine Dion, but her performance lacks the vocal excellence and emotional depth that allows those powerhouses to shine in more pared-down presentations. Perhaps her team knows that Normani is not the performer who appears at best advantage with no razzle-dazzle — that theory would explain both the seemingly random dance moves that punctuate the performance and the failure of the record itself to reach a climax that would demand power and vulnerability of its performer. “Fair” doesn’t trust Normani to pull off the classic heartbreak ballad, and the effect is a hesitant, overly-produced hodge-podge of a track: slightly ballad, slightly dancey, and slightly forgettable.
One wonders if this hesitancy will carry through the rest of Normani’s imminent debut studio album (scheduled to release in summer 2022) of which “Fair” and a recent collaboration with Cardi B titled “Wild Side” are meant to precede. In an Instagram story posted on Feb. 8, Normani described her upcoming album as “genre bending,” hinting that the record will represent an expansion of the artist’s musical toolbox. Certainly, the divergent sounds of “Wild Side” and “Fair” are indicative of some musical exploration, but the question remains whether one artist can capture a wide range of genres successfully, especially within the confines of a singular album. Regardless, the prospect of a record where Normani’s name is not constantly surrounded by parentheses and where her talent and artistry are centered is something to celebrate.

After an eight-year hiatus from solo work, Belgian rapper Stromae has triumphantly re-emerged with “Multitude,” a boisterous album that proves he hasn’t lost his trademark talent for infusing vivacious electro-pop anthems with sharp social commentary. Released on March 4, the Belgian singer-songwriter’s third studio album puts forth 12 masterfully crafted songs that can be appreciated without understanding a word of French. From the Chinese erhu to the Bolivian charango, “Multitude” weaves together sounds and styles from all corners of the world in an eccentric amalgamation that makes for a striking listening experience based on instrumentals alone. But as Stromae shines brightest for his unique subject matter, spending time with the clever lyricism elevates his music to the special status it deserves.
There is a palpable maturity present in “Multitude” that marks Stromae’s growth since his earlier work. Perhaps this wisdom comes from fatherhood, as he and his wife welcomed a son in 2018. While he famously sang from a child’s perspective on his 2013 hit “Papaoutai,” Stromae flips the narrative and takes on the father figure himself in “C’est que de bonheur.” Rather than parroting the party line that “c’est d’la joie” / “it’s only joy,” Stromae is upfront about the brutal reality of “le métier d’parent” / “the profession of parenting.” He raps about the toll childbirth has on his wife and gripes about smelly diapers and vomit. The melody underscores that supposed “endless joy” with a cheerful hook of swinging vocals and a bouncy beat courtesy of Caribbean percussion. But by overlapping this catchy tune with bitter lines about pee and poop, Stromae fills the piece with a rich irony that pits the idealized fantasy of parenting against its exhausting actuality.
Back in October, Stromae released the lead single of the album, “Santé,” which raises a glass “à ceux qui n’en ont pas” / “to those who don't have one.” As the peppiest number on the tracklist, “Santé” celebrates all of the “champions des pires horaires” / “champions of the worst schedules” — the cleaners, the servers, the nurses, and others. In line with the spirit of this song, Stromae takes those who are often overlooked and places them in the spotlight throughout the album. For example, in “Fils de joie,” he sings about a sex worker through the viewpoints of a client, her manager, and a policeman — highlighting how each character is complicit in a system that places stigma solely on women. The choruses share the perspective of her son, who defends his mother with pride while critiquing that “tout l’monde ferme les yeux” / “everybody closes their eyes.” Leaving listeners on edge with a riveting violin strain, the song forces one’s eyes open through the gut-wrenching lyrics sung in guttural intonations. Advocating for those who are too frequently the target of shame rather than support, “Fils de joie” is Stromae at his best.
“Multitude” tends to extract witty depth from surprising places. In “Mauvaise journée,” Stromae dwells on the days when he can’t escape the malaise, complaining, “Y a mon caca qui a mal fini / J’vais devoir frotter une heure et demie” or, “There’s my poo that ended badly / I’m going to have to scrub for an hour and a half.” Complete with whining warbles and overflowing phrases that emulate the frustration of mundanity, this penultimate track sets up its partner song, “Bonne journée,” which closes out the album on a promising note. This time around, “le caca est parfait, même pas besoin qu’je l’essuie” / “the poop is perfect, I do not even need to wipe it.” Ah yes, the duality of poop; only Stromae can manage to wax meaningful verses about the woes of wiping.
Larger than that, however, this fecal metaphor is emblematic of the overall tone of the album. In “Multitude,” listeners are often reminded that life is, well, shitty. Stromae’s tracklist meditates on inescapable depression, unfaithful partners, and unbearable loneliness. There are no false pretenses or sugar-coated reveries, and yet there is an ever-present undercurrent of optimism lingering behind all of that gloom. It is in fact by acknowledging these dark realities in the first place, and doing so with heartfelt lyrics over thrilling refrains, that Stromae manages to leave us basking in the light.

With the resurgence of nostalgic trends driven by Gen Z photographers and the endless re-emergence of styles from the 20th century, the “Real Photo Postcards: Pictures from a Changing Nation” exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston brings some class to the act of reminiscing.
Born from the MFA’s Leonard A. Lauder Postcard Archive and curated by Lynda Klich and Benjamin Weiss, the exhibit highlights the youth and playfulness that defined photography following the creation of the postcard camera, as well as the expansion of news coverage and public fascination in disasters. Panels of postcards show snapshots of hot air balloons and grounded biplane aircraft. One image depicted people swimming in a lake with a figure in mid-dive; the bottom left corner read “COME IN THE WATERS FINE” in perky handwriting.
Shots like these transport visitors into a time they never knew: the early 1900s, awash in brown and gray tones with scenes fit for a Charlie Chaplin film. The ease with which photos could be produced seemed to birth a hedonistic photography style where pictures were taken “just because.” A small child sat with pumpkins in one card, a picnic in another, and a landscape in a third. Photography no longer had to be so serious but a pastime that many could enjoy.
The images, spanning from casual to orchestrated and formal, were oddly similar to what we might see today on Instagram and, as a result, felt intimate. Each photo had a different personality, each portrait representing a different life.
One display was titled “When you look at this, think of me” and was filled with rows upon rows of people posing for a photograph that seemed to box up their personality nicely and tie it with a bow. Some individuals were in lumberjack uniforms, one was seated with a phonograph, and yet another was dressed in a clown costume. Upon taking in the display, one is likely to be overcome with the recognition of the multitude of experiences that are had outside of their own. Despite or perhaps because of this grand understanding, the images still manage to pull viewers closer to each story that is encompassed in the miniature postcard frame.
Veering into a more formal use of postcard cameras, the exhibit features a crescent moon backdrop for visitors to take pictures against — a commonly used backdrop in the early 1920s. While the anthropomorphized crescent moon and starry night background may be an interesting choice for professional pictures today, it emphasizes the playfulness and eccentricity that could be embraced when the risk of not getting the perfect shot with limited film was no longer such a risk.
Families in the 20th century posed in front of paper crescent moons while some children lay on top of it, all of whom were in what seemed to be their finest gowns and suits. It’s almost comical to look at in retrospect, but it’s a nice reminder of the creativity drawn from innovation and new experiences. A reminder that one can pose in their finest clothes in front of a paper moon with a dramatized face on it “just because.” A reminder that, at times, the rules of what should and shouldn’t be done fall away.
Despite the frivolous nature of domestic postcard camera use during this time period, it also enabled darker topics to enter the public eye more consistently. Train car wrecks, tornadoes, and fire rescues in postcard format that eventually circulated through news media were also on display at the exhibit. Media coverage of such tragedies in the 21st century has become a given, yet there is still surprise and fear when those images come up on the news. The feeling is no different when viewing the exhibit’s postcards. From a 20th century perspective, shots like these capture not only the disasters at hand but the growing ubiquity of photography during this time.
“Pictures of a Changing Nation” is the epitome of taking a step back, maybe not always to the ‘good ole’ days,’ but never too far from it. The images span what seems to be everything that life was during the early 1900s — the best parts and some of the worst. The exhibit doesn’t fail to submerge the audience in the ongoings of the photographs, and in doing so, allows the shift in the limits of photography and what that meant for society to be thoroughly understood.

Kidnapping, display toilets in Home Depot, and miniature toy bongs were under the spotlight at the Emerson Colonial Theater on March 19 as “Freestyle Love Supreme” improvised their way through 90 minutes of laughter and curveball audience suggestions. The improv troop comes to the Emerson Colonial Theater as a part of their national tour following a Broadway run that earned the show a Special Tony Award in 2020. The tour’s Boston leg runs from March 18 until April 2.
The show promises an unconventional theatrical experience. The self-described freestyle, improvisational hip-hop comedy group features an ever-changing cast of talented comedians and musicians. Each show consists of a collection of improv “games” following a predetermined structure. However, the topics and outcomes of each game are dependent on audience suggestions.
The Covid-19 pandemic made improv much harder. Distinguishing what audience members are shouting as suggestions is made all the more difficult when masks make sounds muffled and lip reading impossible. But by embracing technology, the group turns the challenge into one of the show's strengths, making “Freestyle Love Supreme” even more interactive. While some games still rely on muffled shouts, others allow audience members to scan a QR code leading to a word suggestion form. These words are then, for example, used in a game where Two Touch (Anthony Veneziele) is tasked with incorporating them into a freestyle rap.
The audience’s role in the show cannot be understated. For each of the six improv games, audience suggestions drive the show's topics. While some suggestions are inevitable — Covid-19, politics, in-laws — and make for excellent joke material, the more outlandish ones prove to be the best fodder for the cast’s creativity. In a game of “Pet Peeves,” an audience member’s disdain for fruit baskets leads to a scathing freestyle about the inadequacy of the gift from Young Nees (Aneesa Folds). Her delightfully absurd rap concludes with a suggestion that there might be a very different place where you could “shove a banana.”
Folds’ willingness and aptitude for taking prompts in unexpected directions is proof that while suggestions from the audience present a challenge, the “Freestyle Love Supreme” cast can brilliantly spin even seemingly mundane topics in unexpected directions. Take for instance the audience suggestion of “ranch dressing” during the game “Things We Love.” Hummingbird (Morgan Reilly) begins with a verse, ditching rap in favor of melody, about her life-long love affair with the condiment. But things quickly take a turn toward the bizarre. Young Nees surprises the audience by completely shifting to a case against ranch in favor of blue cheese, while Jelly Donut (Andrew Bancroft) leaves the audience perplexed, giving a lengthy description of his old job cleaning stables, before ending with a pun about his “ranch dressing” attire.
While the main cast are certainly the stars, the true magic of “Freestyle Love Supreme” lies in the production team hiding behind the scenes. The seamlessness with which they are able to adjust to shifting tones, themes, and topics on the fly and in sync with the main cast is a remarkable achievement. They make it all too easy to forget that the entirety of the show — down to the musical cues and the lighting — is improvised. The small touches, like using purple lighting when a game called upon a “shiny purple toilet” or nailing the timing of a beat drop to end an improvised verse set “Freestyle Love Supreme” apart from any run-of-the-mill improv show.
The number of attendees decked out in the group's merch made it clear that many in the audience were “Freestyle Love Supreme” veterans. This comes as no surprise: With constant laughter shaped by audience suggestions, the show is uniquely suited for repeat viewing. Each performance promises new stories to explore and a fresh batch of jokes delivered by the all-star cast.

Remember the good old days when you couldn’t wait to shop for back-to-school notebooks and binders in middle school? I ~lived~ for deciding which colored folders I would pair with each subject, ascending to my final form as the Stationary Kid, envy of my classmates. Those choices that twelve-year-old-me made have become permanently embedded in my psyche. Some of these might be hot takes. Let’s get into it.
Green belongs with Science. 
This is non-negotiable. Whether it’s chemistry or physics or bio, it doesn’t matter. Green always belongs to the sciences. Science means earthy (re: green) things like plants and bugs.
History is Red. 
I started this history-as-red-streak in my seventh grade Mesopotamia class and haven’t looked back. I’m pretty sure it was because I associated Mesopotamia with heat and the sun, but it soon came to represent the bloodshed we learned about in eighth grade Roman history. And now, no matter what history class I’m in, there’s some sort of bloodshed, so it still checks out to this day.
Spanish = Yellow or Orange. 
I think most would agree with me here. This is probably because many Spanish-speaking countries that Spanish classes focus on have warmer climates (Spain, Mexico), and my middle school Spanish classes were always decked out in yellow, orange, and red.
Math is Black or White. 
Math doesn’t deserve a fun color because it is simply not fun. White for math is acceptable, but bonus points if your high school math binder was black because it sucked the soul out of you similar to a black hole.
English/Literature is Navy Blue. 
I know this is specific and probably unpopular. Yes, blue could work for the sciences but since green takes precedence, blue had to go to English by default. And who can forget the famous “The curtains were f***ing blue”? No? Just me?
Purple is French. 
I’m currently five years strong with French being assigned a purple notebook and binder, and I plan to continue this. I won’t be answering questions.
Feel free to argue with me, but I stand my ground with these decisions. Everyone has their own ways of making school fun (or at least mildly tolerable), and as long as you don’t make math hot pink, we got nothing to worry about.
