After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you ever felt that episodes of “The Simpsons” or “Futurama” are speaking to you personally and intellectually? Do you identify with Lisa Simpson and Bender the robot? Aside from the small concern that you are anthropomorphizing animated pictures, Simon Singh, author of “The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets,” says that this is not an uncommon feeling among students in math and sciences.
 
If you were to ask Singh, he’d probably tell you 1) that you’re a huge nerd, and 2) that the writers of both these TV shows intended to connect with viewers just like you. In a talk Monday eveningpresented by the OFA’s Learning from Performers program and the Harvard Math Department,Singh said that by writing math jokes and subtle references to theorems, the writers of these TV shows are sending a signal to those who get it: math really is exciting, and numbers can be a source of humor if you’re smart enough to get the connections.
 
Singh’s endeavor to uncover and explain the math jokes in the TV shows he loves started nine years ago, when he saw a particular “Simpsons” episode. “I was watching an episode called‘Wizard of Evergreen Terrace,’ and in [it] there’s a reference to Fermat’s Last Theorem,” Singh says. “There’s an equation which would have passed everybody else by—just a bunch of complicated numbers.”
 
Singh, however, had just written a bestselling book called “Fermat’s Last Theorem.” Fermat, a 17th-century mathematician, is well-known among mathematicians for supposedly coming up with advanced conclusions to complicated problems and yet never writing down any of the actual proofs. Instead, he wrote in his notebook that he could, if he had the time, write a proof to back his conclusions, but that he was just too busy. Since Fermat’s death in 1665, mathematicians have indeed proven many of his theorems; Fermat’s Last Theorem, however, remained unproven until 1995. When that same equation appeared in more than one “Simpsons” episode, Singh started to pay attention and realized that the writers of the series might be much more mathematically minded than he’d thought.
 
Upon further research, Singh found that the writers did indeed have a rigorous background in numbers. David X. Cohen ’88, a writer for “The Simpsons” and producer/writer of “Futurama,” studied physics at Harvard and was the president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Writer Al Jean ’81 studied math at Harvard, where he met Mike Reiss ’81; the two collaborated first on The Harvard Lampoon, and then on “The Simpsons” after moving to L.A. post-graduation. Ken Keeler ’83, one of the writers on “Futurama,” studied applied math at Harvard and stayed to get his PhD in 1990.
Many episodes of both “The Simpsons” and “Futurama” include math jokes: the movie theater in “The Simpsons” is called Googolplex, and in one of the first credit runs of a “Simpsons” episode, Maggie spells out “EeqMCsq” with her blocks. For one of Apu’s lines, the writers wanted to make him appear to be a secret math genius and have him mention the 40,000th digit of pi; to get the number correct, they had NASA scientist David H. Bailey mail them 40,000 digits of pi, printed out on thousands of sheets of paper (and in case you’re wondering, the 40,000th digit is 1).
 
Singh also mentioned that for one of the more complicated episodes of “Futurama,” in which characters systematically switched minds, Keeler actually had to prove an entirely new theorem in order to end the episode. He proved that for any number of people in a room trading minds with a “no backsies” rule, if one were to add two more bodies to the original number, it would be possible to return each character’s mind to the correct body.
 
Singh himself is quite brainy when it comes to numbers. In 1991, he received a Ph.D. in particle physics—and then ended up in the world of writing and television. “The majority of my career has been communicating science rather than doing science,” Singh says. In the past 22 years Singh has been a TV producer for the BBC, a math teacher, a documentary director, a nonfiction writer, and an enthusiastic cryptologist. In all aspects of his career, Singh has had to explain complicated math concepts in an accessible way.
 
He says it is easy to create enthusiasm and explain complicated math topics when he himself finds the subject matter so intriguing. “I always pick subjects that, one, I understand and two, I think I can make the bright, curious, general reader understand as well,” Singh says. “Learning to explain things with clarity and brevity on television is really tough compared to writing. Writing is trivial compared to TV, which is why I suppose I have such admiration for ‘The Simpsons’ writers because they’re working in a medium that is very unforgiving, and they’ve been succeeding for 25 years.”

It is always shocking when the lighter side of life emerges from the depths of existential musings. “Raised in Captivity,” a modern dark comedy that will play through Nov. 16 at the Loeb Ex, endeavors to distill and convey this sentiment on stage through a tumultuous tale.
Written by Nicky Silver, the play depicts the story of two estranged siblings, Sebastian Bliss (Teis D. Jorgensen ’14) and Bernadette Dixon (Susanna B. Wolk ’14), whose lives are thrust into chaos after misfortune leaves their mother victim to a wayward showerhead.  Havoc ensues as marriages shatter, murderers becomes advisors, and psychologists and prostitutes overstep clientele expectations.
“It’s both funny and dark,” director Lily R. Glimcher ’14 says. “It deals with loss, abandonment, and identity, asking what happens when everything that you thought made you who you are is ripped away from you.”
Glimcher says that the wisdom and comedy arises from an honest representation of the characters, who themselves are quite funny. “Raised in Captivity” seeks to strike upon the most profound of life’s questions with a droll candor that, according to Glimcher, should make the audience more receptive to its insights.
Offering a fast-paced plot, an eclectic lineup of characters, and an experienced cast, “Raised in Captivity” is intent on using humor and shock to challenge standard perceptions of relationships. If answers to life’s many mysteries and some good laughs are not enough to entice, Glimcher also says that the characters will be double-casted, providing another level of intriguing complication to the play.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 10, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly reversed the names of the actors who played two estranged siblings in the comedy “Raised in Captivity.” In fact, Teis D. Jorgensen ’14 played the character Sebastian Bliss, and Susanna B. Wolk ’14 played the character Bernadette Dixon, not the other way around.

Some scenes lack dialogue, others are nearly motionless; at least one resonates with marital discord, and another, with the edgy voice of a ’50s radio advertisement. The DisOrient Players—Harvard’s Asian American theater group—will put up their debut play, Charles L. Mee’s “Under Construction,” in the Adams Pool Theatre tonight and tomorrow night. This collage-like show promises no saccharine love story or much of a narrative at all, but Mee’s experimental play, directed by Karoline K. Xu ’16, does offer a series of cultural clips—isolated portraits of real-life moments that make for a bold presentation of different conceptions of race and identity. 
“Under Construction” ventures through time and setting, touring the vast halls of America’s collective memory with a focus on repression in the 1950s. As the show progresses, the play pitches questions about societal norms, romance, familial allegiances, and gender roles.
 
But answers are unlikely to be provided. “We hope the audience will be entertained, thoughtfully provoked, and even a bit confused,” Xu says. Producers Haemin Jee ’14 and Xu in part selected Mee’s “Under Construction” because it is so open to interpretation.
 
The DisOrient Players intend to realize the play’s title, “Under Construction,” not only in content, but also in form. Alternating scene order on successive nights, Harvard’s new theater troupe will strive to remain theatrically elastic.
 
“Playwright Charles Mee actively promotes diverse casting as well as uniquely interpreting and reworking his pieces, two issues we found important,” Xu says. Adopting Mee’s emphasis on daringly disjointed scenes, the DisOrient Players looks to debut this piece with a bang.

The latest in Disney’s new overhaul of the Marvel comic world is the surprisingly charming second installment in the “Thor” franchise, “Thor: The Dark World.” As with many recent Marvel films, “The Dark World” gives equal weight to wry wit and hammer-clashing battle. Though assuredly a superhero flick, “The Dark World” rises above expectations thanks to its pithy humor, gorgeous visuals, and the creation of a perfect supervillain in Loki.  
 
Despite the consistent use of scientific terms and Norse mythology,  it should be made clear that the plot of the story is ridiculously convoluted. As stated pretty clearly in the title, “The Dark World” is a classic battle of light vs. dark, good vs. evil. The villainous Dark Elves want to use a powerful “Aether” to remove light for all nine realms of the universe when the realms converge. This is explained by numerous gods and physicists throughout the film. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), excited by the strange physics surrounding the portal between realms, accidentally falls through it and finds herself infected by the long-lost “Aether.” Returning to Earth poisoned by this substance, she has no hope but Thor, who flies down and whisks her off to Asgard. To save Jane from the Dark Elves, Thor must ask for the help of Loki, the trickster god. If it all sounds scientifically and logically suspect, that’s because it is. It’s Thor, for gods’ sakes.
 
Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is one of the main reasons this film works as well as it does. In Loki, the Marvel franchise has found what no other superhero film has: a villain that can span more than one film. Because Loki is Thor’s brother (and, you know, dreamy beyond all belief) it is never clear whether or not his character is wholly sympathetic or purely evil. One of the flaws of movies like “Man of Steel” and even the new Batman films is that the audience knows basically beyond a shadow of a doubt that the main character will not die. But even though Thor is never in danger in “The Dark World,” but this is not the case for Loki. In fact, when he plays the villain, he has to lose for “good guy” Thor to win. This complicates the audience’s attachment to Loki, for while many root for him—or at least don’t want him to lose—we also fear that he can’t possibly win out. Hiddleston has injected mischievous life into Loki’s character, and he steals every scene. Throughout the franchise, Hiddleston’s character is the only one that really gets to explore any depth—exploring his paternity, his family, his need for power—and he plays the part well.
 
As with the first film, the romance between Jane Foster and Thor leans into the silly high school love story gimmick without ever letting it get too schmaltzy—kisses never finish, music gets cut off, and a reunion scene in the rain stays dry thanks to a convenient new anti-gravity field. Thor even endears himself to the audience by making a jealous joke about Chris O’Dowd (who is perfect in his cameo as the suitor who doesn’t stand a chance against a Norse god). As with many recent blockbusters, the film relies heavily at times on the 3D gimmick, adding too many birds and tricks of falling glass to do anything but distract the audience. The gimmick can’t keep up with fight scenes and doesn’t always fit with the film’s tone, which seems to break away a little from the latest 3D formula action movies. The visuals, however, do deliver, and anyone who wants to see the film should make a point of seeing it on the big screen. Unlike the first “Thor,” the sequel is more “Star Wars” than storybook myth.  
 
Despite being a sequel, “The Dark World” wastes no time with synopsis. The Marvel universe does a good job of maintaining the continuity of the events of blockbusters like “Thor” and “The Avengers” without confusing audience members who stayed home from those films. At the open of “The Dark World,” Loki is in chains for what he did to New York in “The Avengers”—he even gets a little slap from Jane Foster—but he could just as easily be locked up for trying to kill his brother in the first “Thor.” When Thor finally returns for Jane, she cries, “You were in New York!” signaling that she saw him fighting with the Avengers. 
 
“Thor: The Dark World” delivers upon what it promises and will easily satisfy anyone looking for a fun weekend blockbuster. Those who enjoy a 3D popcorn flick bursting with over-the-top CGI, epic battles, and humor created through random acts of physics won’t be disappointed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“He’s making this country into the best machine he can,” goes the upbeat, silvery refrain sounded thousands of times a day on trains, trams, and television sets across the country. And speaking of trains (and speaking of across the country!), a network of maglev tracks, vaguely late Victorian in appearance, crisscrosses the landscape, its trains running perfectly on time as they barrel from city to city.
“Craft!” whispers another, smaller voice from your corner lamppost, giving testimony to a national ethos whose name, shared with the currency, derives from the suffix of the president’s surname. Not quite president, but “director,” he reminds foreign correspondents. That was his title when the family business acquired the hard-hit national government on December 31, 1996, and as far as he’s concerned, nothing has changed.
This is Friedland, an industrial North Atlantic island nation of about 20,000,000—Anglo-American enough to be keenly familiar but German enough to have excellent railways and a trade surplus. Its technocratic director, Rosencraft, 49, is a vigorous, black-haired devil of a manager—known for his unique synthesis of machine efficiency and ubiquitous personality. He is neither liberal nor conservative, neither parochial nor universalistic. If he has a given name, it is neither here nor there. He just works.
I could tell you many more things about fictitious Friedland and its singular leader (not Guildenstern’s companion, but CRAFT!), because my roommate and I invented the whole system out on the MAC quad one unusually cold April night our sophomore year. Too old and too world-aware to waste our time on political escapism, you might be thinking. To that, I respond that the world of Rosencraft is a passing mode, not an obsession; the butt of jokes, rather than the object of role-play.
But most importantly, I submit that my exercise in political [dys/u]topia is exactly the kind of act of “applied imagination” that a student of history, politics, and culture should be engaging in—infinitely more stimulating and attention-sustaining than Facebook or Gawker, while less time-consuming than writing a political novel. Friedland brims not only with productivity, but with much of what we’ve learned over the last few years about industrialization, managerial progressivism, fascist aesthetics, and the role of institutions in development.
Let me now continue to tell you about this strange republic of craft. In the late 17th century, it was settled by German craftsmen from the Electorate of Hanover, who intermarried with the natives and shaped the countryside in the image of their Teutonic homeland. Over the course of the personal union of the principality with Great Britain under the House of Hanover, Friedland (peaceful land) filled up with British and Irish immigrants, prompting London’s formal annexation of the large island in 1837. Half a century later, Friedland was fully independent – having successfully rebelled against Britain’s mercantilist efforts to tamp down its industrial spirit and transform it into a producer of raw materials.
It is the sort of country that breeds men like Rosencraft: salty, iconoclastic, no-frills. (And I mean no frills: lace and ruffles of all kinds have been banned in Friedland for as long as anyone can remember; memorable photos show immigration inspectors in Luneburg harbor snipping the lace trim off an Irish toddler’s little dress.) He has the same regard for electoral democracy, Enlightenment ideals, and hoarded wealth as he does for lace trim, and yet manages through managerial competency to post consistent growth numbers, enviable educational statistics, and a Scandinavian-quality Gini coefficient.
Citizens were initially suspicious when Rosencorp, the manufacturing giant founded by Rosencraft’s father, Hermann, acquired Friedland’s indebted government on the eve of 1997. However, he has managed since to win at the polls by Baathist margins—accomplished in part by Baathist volumes of beatific (and somewhat steampunk) propaganda, but made possible primarily by his benign, hands-on habit of appearing weekly as a guest on Night Sky to announce revisions to the train schedules and to Get Frank (“I’ll be frank!” he avers, hand cutting measuredly through the air, kicked back, black socks exposed) about tough issues. He is part Cory Booker and part Lee Kuan Yew.
He's compensating for something, of course. You see, when Hermann and Ingrid Rosencraft weren’t busy running Rosencorp and entertaining notables, they were busy getting drunk off white wine and laughing heartily on the deck of their mountain chateau, where their son dimly remembers being left to his own devices with some plain beige building blocks. He would build and rearrange and build some more, and practice his radio voice—oh, if someone would just hear him! Deeply embittered by these memories, he raises his two teenage daughters and his one grown-up country to be tough and to be heard.
Open your government textbook and listen close enough: You can almost hear them.

It has begun. The great Rand Paul-Chris Christie race in the 2016 Republican presidential primary is in full swing—and has been this entire election season, commencing well before Senator Paul took the day after Christie’s bruising reelection to criticize the New Jersey governor. This precipitous opening was not exactly inevitable; after all, the Kentucky Senator did not have to face voters on Tuesday, and many pundits observed his somewhat surprising timorousness during last month’s government shutdown. But Paul could not wait, and his involvement in this cycle’s race for governor of Virginia marked his first purely politically motivated step for the 2016 GOP crown. Unfortunately for him, that has led to the current score—Christie 1, Paul 0.
The next presidential election is shaping up to be the end-all be-all brawl for the future of the Republican Party. The battle lines have been drawn. In one corner stands the scion to the political dynasty founded by the self-proclaimed father of the Tea Party. In the other, we have the supposed champion of the moderates, the man who still receives puritanical flak for consorting with President Obama during Hurricane Sandy last year. The friction between the two transcends ideological disagreements, and their rivalry is clearly personal. Earlier this year, Christie characterized the privacy concerns of libertarians like Paul as “esoteric, intellectual debates,” and Paul responded by attacking the conservative credentials of “the king of bacon talking about bacon.”
Ad hominem attacks aside, the results of Tuesday night’s elections provide premonitory implications about the Christie-Paul spat; in the past couple weeks, the political decisions of other prominent Republicans established the relative fortunes of Christie in New Jersey and Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli in Virginia as a de facto proxy campaign between the two GOP heavyweights. The results: Christie won by 22 points in the deep-blue Garden State; “Cooch” lost by two and a half points in reddish-purple Old Dominion.
To say that these results map onto a victory for Christie and (even more so) a loss for Paul may seem like a stretch. After all, Rand Paul is not the “untrustworthy and unlikeable” Ken Cuccinelli, nor is he Barbara Buono, Christie’s erstwhile, “little-known” Democratic opponent for the Governor’s Mansion. But Rand Paul tied his standing with Cuccinelli’s in a race in which the GOP establishment worrisomely kept significant resources from the party’s Tea Party-flavored standard-bearer. Whereas Cuccinelli’s opponent, Clinton crony Terry McAuliffe—made famous for his ideologically deficient pragmatism in Mark Leibovich’s summer hit “This Town”—was joined by Democratic bigwigs Bill Clinton and Barack Obama on the campaign trail, Cuccinelli could not even secure the endorsement of Virginia’s quintessential most prominent (excluding scandal-embroiled Governor Bob McDonnell) establishment Republican, Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling.
There are a variety of explanations for the national GOP’s abandonment of Cuccinelli, although New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02 does a good job dispelling the seemingly rational ones employed by the party itself. Regardless of reasoning, the desertion of Cuccinelli by the Christie-esque faction of the party created a vacuum at the top of the Republican attorney general’s endorsement list. Enter Senator Rand Paul.
Despite assertions from both the GOP’s D.C.-class and its libertarian wing that Cuccinelli’s social conservatism warranted a protest vote for Libertarian Party candidate Robert Sarvis, Rand Paul, arguably the nation’s most powerful libertarian, eschewed that line of reasoning in becoming Cuccinelli’s most prominent backer. Paul and his more doctrinaire father both joined their party’s candidate on the stump in the days leading up to the election. (It should be mentioned that Florida Senator Marco Rubio, another potential candidate for the presidency, also joined Cuccinelli on the eve of Election Day, albeit with significantly less fanfare.)
What does this mean? While Cuccinelli lost, the result should not be construed as a Virginia referendum of Rand Paul’s presidential aspirations. If anything, Paul probably was successful in imploring some Sarvis voters that Cooch “would arguably be the most libertarian governor in the United States.” (Exit polls suggest that Sarvis ended up drawing more potential Democrats than potential Republicans.) But it does attest to Paul’s inability to mobilize large swaths of voters, especially—and most importantly to his primary chances—those with the pocketbooks thick enough to bankroll his campaign. That does not bode well for his chances in a party that has nominated the pragmatic, ideologically lacking option in every election post-Reagan.
The news is not all good for Chris Christie either. The complete absence of coattails assisting other Republican candidates in his state is troubling, and it should not go unnoticed by election prognosticators. Yet he won big when Paul’s candidate lost. And Paul knows it—after refusing to congratulate his fellow Republican when initially asked for comment, he later went out of his way to call Christie’s election strategy “offensive.”
Post-election withdrawal inevitably leads to takeaway mania among pundits trying desperately to sate their thirst for political horseracing.  As I see it, the takeaways are as follows. First, Paul bet big on Cuccinelli and lost, while Christie’s cozy relationship with establishmentarians of both parties proved hugely advantageous to securing his easy win. Second, we are long past the days of Ronald Reagan’s famous Eleventh Commandment; modern Republicans have no qualms “speaking ill” of their intra-party adversaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We never thought we would see the day when adults were bemoaning the foresight and responsibility of the American youth. But the national anxiety over the decline of the humanities major smacks of exactly that sentiment. Young adults, some argue—under pressure from their parents and an unforgiving job market—feel they must pursue practical paths. For others, the fact that fewer students are choosing to study things like English and art history is evidence that our society’s cultural fabric is fraying.
But we’re not especially sorry to see the English majors go.
Economies change, as does the demand for certain types of expertise and skill. Increased mechanization and digitization necessitates an increased number of engineers and programmers. Humanities apologists should be able to appreciate this—if Thought Catalog and Instagram are any indication, they’re fans of the internet, too. It’s true that fewer humanities majors will mean fewer credentialed literary theorists and hermeneutic circles. But the complement—an increased number of students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and math—will mean a greater probability of breakthroughs in research. We refuse to rue a development that has advances in things like medicine, technological efficiency, and environmental sustainability as its natural consequence.
What is more, the decline of the humanities major need not give us reason to anticipate the decline of the humanities: Academics do not have unique access to the instructions for being human. Whether they study history and literature, applied math, or organismic and evolutionary biology, people will continue to seek truth in philosophy, solace in music, and company in the pages of books.
In fact, we suspect that humanities professors’ effective surrender of any claim to objectivity—that is, their admission that they cannot provide authoritative understandings of texts on the grounds that no such understandings exist—was the first nail in the humanities’ coffin. Why spend four years listening to lecturers warn you that you can never really know anything? Or worrying that failing to dissect a text or event along the lines of race, class, or gender will result in an accusation of moral and intellectual responsibility (or worse, a bad grade)? The disciplines that once could claim to open the mind and free the spirit now seem to endorse a specific, sometimes discouraging, type of thinking.
We are skeptical that those who study math, science, and engineering chose their fields because they were enamored of the idea of living problem set to problem set. Indeed, if students are choosing “rigorous” concentrations not out of a love for objectivity but out of a fear of professional failure, then that is lamentable. (This is especially true for Harvard students—not because we should feel entitled to successful careers, but because many of us are so eager to please that we’ve never been less than perfectly vigilant about anything in our lives.) Still, impracticality is not a virtue in and of itself. Practical value and intellectual merit are not mutually exclusive, and one does not necessarily dwell where the other is absent. Learning to program, or research, or calculate can be enjoyable as well as useful.
Just as wheat and corn survived the decline of the American farmer, our culture, our values, and our yearning to understand our acquaintances and ourselves will survive the decline of the humanities major. To those who are upset with the trend, we say: Let them eat code.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday I got the Colorado flag tattooed on my ankle for no apparent reason.
Mid-life crisis: noun
1. An emotional crisis of identity and self-confidence that can occur in early middle age.
2. A period of emotional turmoil in middle age caused by the realization that one   is no longer young and characterized especially by a strong desire for change.
Some deal with mid-life crises by taking out second mortgages to support new Ferrari collections. Others try their hand at erotic fiction and install a stripper pole in the living room. I, on the other hand, found myself at Chameleon Tattoo and Body Piercing, getting my home state’s flag permanently etched into my skin.
Maybe “mid-life crisis” isn’t the best term to categorize my sudden masochistic rebellion; I have not been pondering my own morality, nor do I intend on accepting it at 40. But when I pondered how I would explain to my mother why the “drawing” on my skin is so durable (and I can only avoid the shower for so long), attributing my action to my sophomore slump just didn’t seem to cut it.
I started defining my year by the sophomore slump the moment I realized living in the Quad meant I could no longer roll out of bed at the time class was supposed to start and still make it on Harvard time. Suddenly our professors began assuming we knew how to write a paper, our advisers expected us to know what our interests were, and our TFs stopped accepting getting lost as a valid excuse for missing section. Not to mention the looming concentration deadline yet to be addressed—how am I supposed to know what I want to study when I still haven’t figured out how to get to William James Hall?
Though throwing around the phrase “sophomore slump” has conveniently made scowling a slightly more socially acceptable answer to “how are you?” and has justified my ambivalence toward anything that isn’t my extra long twin-size mattress, I have begun to realize that accepting a sophomore slump, or really any slump, might just be part of the problem.
The main issue I take with defining this lackluster phase as the “slump” is that it seems to imply we have no agency in addressing our own problems; if sophomore slump is an inevitable and all-encompassing stage of all our college careers, we have no choice but to ride it out until its bitter end.
What if instead of a slump, this age of second-guessing ourselves really is a full-fledged mid-life crisis? Rethinking a lifelong commitment to medicine, for example, certainly seems to qualify as a “crisis of identity” or “strong desire for change.” Call it a quarter-life crisis if you want to get technical about modern life expectancy or don’t like associating yourself with your middle-aged, pole-dancing parents, but the fundamental idea still stands. By classifying the slump as a crisis, we’re acknowledging the need for change.
The excitement of freshmen year is long gone. The giddy happiness of being here and zany sense of newness and endless possibilities has been replaced with a gnawing sense that our time here is finite—while we may not be approaching the halfway marker of our life expectancy, we are certainly approaching the halfway marker of our college careers.
All of a sudden we’re forced to think about why we’re studying what we’re studying, what we’re really doing here at all, and slowly we question if the routine that has come to define us has actually been fulfilling; if the sacrifices we’ve made—friendships we’ve lost, nights we’ve spent sleepless in Lamont—have all been worth it.
Maybe our youth is less of an issue—I like to think I still have a few good years left—but the rest of this so-called slump surely resembles the makings of a mid-life crisis.
It’s midterm season (AKA the end of shopping week until reading period), and we are quickly approaching the season of death, which, in Cambridge, means it now gets dark after lunch, and I will soon have to sacrifice my class participation grade if I can’t figure out the shuttle system—unfortunately my attempts at mobilizing Quadlings against attending class in the winter have been ill-received.
But just because we have to accept perpetual cold and darkness (unless we transfer to Stanford) doesn’t mean we have to accept the decline of our youthful exuberance quite yet.
While feeling confused, unfulfilled, or just plain unhappy seems to be a pretty common theme right now, our individual reactions are entirely our own; “sophomore slump” need not be something to grin and bear.
Whether it’s taking a semester off to become reacquainted with yourself and your happiness, re-thinking the pre-med track for a degree in folklore and mythology, or getting a largely unhelpful and unwanted tattoo, it’s okay to indulge your inner crisis and ignore the consequences for a while.
Even though I’m not a 40-year-old man juggling a secret family in Barbados, I’m going to enjoy my mid- (or quarter-) life crisis. And if that means being reckless and stupid, at least I’m the one controlling it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Royalty graced the streets of Cambridge on Thursday when Queen Rania Al-Abdullah of Jordan and Prince Moulay Hicham of Morocco gave speeches to crowds in Harvard Law School’s Wasserstein Hall during the opening night of the seventh annual Harvard Arab Weekend Conference.  During her speech, Abdullah argued for the importance of education in creating a more positive future for the Middle East as well as changing perceptions of the region.
Following Abdullah’s speech and a short intermission, Hicham spoke about the importance of reclaiming the Arab Spring, and answered questions from the audience.
Abdullah’s speech served as the opening remarks of the conference, which will feature various panels and keynote speakers that highlight issues facing the Arab world today. Hosted entirely at the Law School, the theme of this year’s conference is “Cherish, Challenge, Change.”
Abdullah said Arabs find themselves in an unavoidable cycle where people tend to only see the negative side of their culture.
“Pessimism doesn’t change reality. It elongates the status quo,” Abdullah said. “Optimism, coupled with faith, can change reality.”
At the heart of her message was a call to her peers to help produce a “new Arab world,” a world which she said could only be achieved by actively making efforts to create change.
Specifically, Abdullah encouraged the participants of the conference to invest efforts into a new Arab system of massive open online courses which have previously not existed in the Arab language. During the conference, she announced the launch of these MOOCs as part of a larger effort called Madrasati, a public-private partnership aimed at renovating needy public schools.  A strong advocate for education, Abdullah explained that this revolutionary practice could be one of the tools needed to transform learning in the Middle East.
“Education is not a panacea for all our ills,” she said. “But done well, education is perhaps the greatest equalizer.”
Many audience members said that they were inspired by her optimistic message.
“She was very motivating,” said Asma Ajroudi, an Arab foreign exchange student from Northwestern University. “But as [Queen Abdullah] said, it’s one thing to say and another thing to do.  We should actually go out there and make change happen.”
The Harvard Arab Weekend, which is the largest pan-Arab conference in North America, is seeing its highest level of attendance to date with over 800 attendees. It is organized and put on by the Harvard Arab Alumni Association with assistance from a large group of student volunteers.
Event organizers said they hope the four-day weekend will provide an outlet for self-expression and exploration for participants.
“Our main goal is for attendees to leave with the positive message and be able to make a positive impact on our world,” said Nour O. Alnuaimi, Harvard Arab Weekend co-chair and a graduate student at Harvard Business School.
Yazane Alaily, Alnuaimi’s co-chair and a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School, echoed this sentiment.
“We want to acknowledge the good things taking place, but also challenge the assumptions of our own identities and how to change them,” Alaily said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s financial report for the 2013 fiscal year, released by the University on Friday, paints a picture of a University that has recovered significantly from losses suffered during the recent financial crisis but is still looking with anticipation to the Harvard Campaign for relief, if not for a complete solution to all financial difficulties.
According to the report, in FY 2013—which ended on June 30—Harvard posted an operating deficit of about $34 million, a figure called “manageable” in a letter accompanying the release by University Vice President for Finance and CFO Daniel S. Shore and by University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68. The number represents less than 1 percent of the University’s revenue in FY 2013, according to the report.
FY 2013 also saw the University experience growth in net assets of more than 8 percent, likely due, at least in part, to donations solicited during the “quiet phase” preceding the public launch of the Harvard Campaign. University President Drew G. Faust announced on September 21 that Harvard had, current of that date, raised $2.8 billion of the $6.5 billion it seeks in the fundraising drive.
Also in September, Harvard announced a strong endowment performance with an investment return rate of 11.3 percent and a total endowment of $32.7 billion, figures that were also reflected in the report.
But while Faust, in a letter accompanying Friday’s financial report, highlighted what she called “a year of renewal and advancement,” she presented a more cautious outlook looking forward. Though she wrote that the capital campaign will help the University continue and launch projects like a new home for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in Allston, advances in educational technology, continued support for financial aid, and other initiatives, she stressed that it will not solve all of the University’s financial difficulties.
“The campaign is not a panacea for the significant challenges that we face,” she wrote. “We will need to meet those challenges by acting thoughtfully and decisively as a community; we will adapt where circumstances demand it.” 
Other data from the report showed that the University is still clearly recuperating from the heavy losses suffered in the financial crisis. After FY 2013, Harvard still holds $5.7 billion in debt, a figure that has not fully rebounded from the record $6.3 billion of debt the University reported for FY 2011.
“While we believe debt is an important enabler of growth, it currently constitutes an outsized portion of the University’s capital structure,” Shore and Rothenberg wrote.
The University’s financial health mirrors closely the financial situation in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard’s largest faculty. Last month, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ‘79 released a similar report, writing that while FAS has recovered impressively since the financial crisis, there is more work to be done. They too wrote that the newly launched capital campaign will not solve all financial problems. 
“The planning and preparation we have done during this period will ensure the Harvard Capital Campaign—while not a panacea—will directly address both academic priorities and financial pressures in the FAS,” Kirwan wrote in the October report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off two nail biters in the last two weeks, the Harvard football team (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) is looking to put away this week’s opponent, Columbia (0-7, 0-4 Ivy), in a more decisive fashion Saturday so that it will not have to rely on the leg of kicker junior Andrew Flesher as it has in week’s past.
A win for Harvard is crucial, as it would give the Crimson a share of the Ivy League lead if Penn beats Princeton this Saturday.
This would lead to a three-way tie for first place in the Ancient Eight with just two weeks left in the season, guaranteeing an exciting finish to an already hectic season.
Harvard’s battle this weekend should be easier than most. The Crimson has had considerable success against the Lions in recent years, as the team has defeated Columbia by at least two touchdowns in every season since 2003.
Despite the history, the Lions have shown enough spark for a potential upset.
Less than a month ago, Columbia fell to Penn, which is tied with Harvard for second in the Ivy League, by just two touchdowns. The Lions kept the Quakers scoreless in both the first and third quarters, and it held on to a lead 10 minutes into the second quarter.
Even so, if this season’s record is any indicator of the outcome of the game to come, things do not bode well for Columbia, which is looking for its first win in nearly a year.  In the Lions’ last eight games, they have lost more than half by 41 or more points.
Harvard, however, is not without its own problems.
Much of its team has been hampered with injuries, especially on offense. Sophomore running back Paul Stanton has been tasked to carry much of the load, and he has averaged nearly 100 yards and more than one touchdown a game.
Junior quarterback Conner Hempel has also been playing well, recording nearly 250 yards and more than two touchdowns per start.
“We have a few people who might be injured, and that might affect the rotation, but from what I’ve seen in previous weeks, when one player goes down, there’s another player that is ready to step up,” Flesher said.
The defense, too, has also had its struggles. The Crimson is giving up 27.1 points per game, third worst in the Ivy League. Harvard’s passing defense has given up more than 300 yards per game, and opposing quarterbacks have been able to complete 63 percent of their passes against the Crimson. That said, the run defense has held opposing teams to just over 100 yards per game.
The Crimson can use this game to develop its play and strategy on both sides of the ball. The team, however, does not foresee itself working on anything too complex.
“We’re going to be sticking to the basics,” Stanton said.
It is unlikely that Columbia will take the same approach to the game, as the Lions are still seeking their first win of the season.
A player that could push this upset is senior running back Marcorus Garrett, who is averaging 83.3 all-purpose yards per game and has all four rushing touchdowns for Columbia. On defense senior linebacker Brian East has two picks, two recovered fumbles, and one forced fumble. Fellow linebacker Vinny Pugliese leads the team with five tackles for a loss with an average of 4.6 yards lost per tackle.
In general, however, the Lions are looking for more production on both sides of the ball. The offense is scoring under ten points a game, and the defense is giving up more than 42 points per game.
This team is looking for players to step up and carry the team to some success on the year, and this game will no doubt be another experimental period for the coaches and players.
The game serves as an opportunity for two teams that have very different records to improve and work towards their goals.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy will be looking for something more than just the win.
“Our goal is not just to win but is to play to our potential, and to get better every week,” Murphy said. “Sometimes we’ve done that, and sometimes we haven’t, but we have certainly played hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s basketball team prepares to take the floor for its season opener on Sunday, expectations surrounding the club are higher than ever.
After grabbing at least a share of the Ivy League crown in each of the last three seasons and winning a total of 69 games, the Crimson has established itself as the team to beat in the Ancient Eight.
Harvard’s upset victory over New Mexico in last year’s NCAA Tournament has also earned the team attention on the national stage. The Crimson enter the season ranked 31st in the nation by the Associated Press and 32nd in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll.
Nonetheless, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker says that his team is trying to ignore the hype.
“Our identity is consistent, our standards are consistent, and our goals are consistent,” Amaker said. “A lot of times [compared to] whatever the quote-unquote expectations may be, more than likely, our standards and our goals are even higher.”
This season the Crimson will be full of familiar faces. Last season’s co-captain Christian Webster was the only senior on last year’s squad, but even he will be returning to the Harvard bench as an assistant coach.
Seniors Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey will also make their returns on Sunday. After sitting out last season, the two veterans will look to create an immediate impact.
“I’m excited,” Curry said. “It’s a day I’ve been waiting for for a long, long time, so I’m just thrilled that it’s finally here…This is the best that I’ve ever felt, and I’m just excited to be back [and] ready to go for this year.”
The Crimson is slated to play Holy Cross in the finale of the first annual Coaches vs. Cancer Tripleheader at the TD Garden. Sponsored by the American Cancer Society, the event will first feature a match-up between Boston University and Northeastern, followed by a game between Boston College and UMass.
The Crusaders are looking to open the season strong as they attempt to rebound from a seventh place finish in the Patriot League. Holy Cross finished the 2012-13 campaign with a 12-18 record, winning only four conference games.
Although the Crusaders lead its overall series with Harvard, 40-25, the Crimson has beaten Holy Cross five consecutive times. However, when the two teams clashed last year at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crusaders gave the host all it could handle.
Led by 22 points from then-junior forward Dave Dudzinski, the Crusaders battled Harvard shot for shot. But four made free throws down the stretch by Crimson co-captain Laurent Rivard sealed a 72-65 Harvard victory.
The Crimson will have its hands full again trying to defend Dudzinski. Now a co-captain, the forward is looking to build on a season in which he averaged 15.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. Fellow co-captain Justin Burrell, a junior point guard, is also an integral part of the Holy Cross offense.
Amaker has yet to announce his starting lineup for Sunday’s game. The depth of his team offers an abundance of potential starting combinations.
“We could have different lineups for different games, [and] we could have different lineups for different halves,” Amaker said. “We’ve talked to our guys [about] not focusing so much on starting and total number of minutes, [but] how productive can we be, how efficient can we be, and how good can we be with whatever unit is out on the floor.”
Plenty of eyes will be on the Harvard backcourt. Last season, in Curry’s absence, then-freshman point guard Siyani Chambers stepped into the starting role and powered the offense. The rookie averaged 12.4 points and 5.7 assists per game, becoming the first ever freshman to be named first-team All Ivy.
Now, Curry returns to the lineup and is expected to play alongside Chambers as a shooting guard. The senior says he is adjusting to his new role.
“Having Siyani now run the point sometimes, I got to remember what the two-guard does,” Curry said. “I’m definitely going to get a lot more open shots, and I got to knock them down.”
One player who is sure to be in the starting lineup for the Crimson is junior wing Wesley Saunders. Like Chambers, Saunders was named first-team all-Ivy, leading the Ancient Eight with 16.2 points per game.
“Wesley is our best player,” Amaker said. “Call it what it is. That’s not a knock to anybody else, but Wesley has proven to be our best player…He’s worked very hard to earn that, and I think all our guys would agree.”
With the exception of UMass, Harvard will play each of the participants in the tripleheader once this season. Amaker says that every squad will provide his team a challenge.
“We know how hard people are going to come after us every game that we’re going to play,” Amaker said. “We’re no longer the story of Cinderella…We know whether it’s Holy Cross or whoever else…we’re going to be a marked team, and that’s an incredible compliment for who we are and how far we’ve come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thank God for Twitter.
The social media company that is slowly taking over the world was traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for the first time Thursday morning. Its price quickly shot up, finishing the day 73 percent higher than it started. Of course it did—Twitter is awesome.
Twitter helps spread breaking news. It allows fans to watch athletes feud in real time. It gives you (shameless plug alert) the chance to follow Harvard sports news @THCSports. But most importantly, Twitter is going to keep me sane this weekend.
At 12:30 p.m. Saturday, Harvard (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) will take the field against Columbia (0-7, 0-4 Ivy). Last year, the Crimson literally could not stop scoring on the Lions in a 69-0 embarrassment. The game might not be any closer this time around.
So I’m going to be following something else.
Harvard has lost to Columbia just once in the last 14 years. This year, the Lions have dropped their last two conference games by a combined score of 109-12. Those losses have come to a pair of teams that are 2-4 against other Ivy competition.
All of this is to say that Columbia is not just bad, it is a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad team.
Given that, it’s hard for me to even call Saturday’s contest a game. It’s even harder for me to get excited about covering it.
While the Crimson tries to show mercy in New York, a much bigger game will be played 80 miles southeast of Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. Princeton, still undefeated in conference play, travels to Penn, which stumbled against Brown last weekend.
If the Tigers can get by the Quakers in what might be the second biggest rivalry in Ivy football, they would just have to beat Yale and Dartmouth to sweep conference play. But if Penn can pull off the upset, everything changes. All of the sudden, Harvard, Penn, and Princeton would each have one loss in advance of Penn’s biennial trek to Cambridge.
So excuse me if Harvard-Columbia doesn’t have my full attention Saturday. I might be on Twitter, following the more exciting action.
HARVARD at COLUMBIA
The question isn’t who, but by how much. The Lions have lost to Princeton by 46, Dartmouth by 56, and Yale by 41 this season. The predicted high Saturday in New York is 51 degrees. Will Harvard beat Columbia by more than that? I think so, but at least that is a question worth asking.
PICK: Harvard 55, Columbia 3
BROWN (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) at YALE (4-3. 2-2 Ivy) 
The top of the Ivy pecking order is becoming increasingly clear, but the middle of the pack remains as muddled as ever, with the Bears, Bulldogs, and Big Green all entering the weekend 2-2 in league play. That said, Brown appears to be the best of the ‘B’ bunch. Its only losses are to Princeton and Harvard and it shut out Penn, 27-0, last weekend. A win at Yale would solidify the Bears’ position as the best of the rest.
PICK: Brown 31, Yale 27
BROWN PRINCETON (6-1, 4-0 Ivy) at PENN (4-3, 3-1 Ivy)
Princeton has not won an outright Ivy title since 1995. It has claimed a share just three times in the last 40 seasons.
A win Saturday would go a long way in earning the Tigers another one.
As much as an upset would make the final two weeks more interesting, I don’t see it happening. Simply put, nobody has been able to stop the Princeton offense, which has scored nearly 200 more points than Penn has over the first seven games of this season.
PICK: Princeton 38, Penn 20
CORNELL (1-6, 0-4 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (3-4, 2-2 Ivy)
After winning its first game of the year, the Big Red has dropped six straight games, giving up 34 points or more each week. I don’t think that’s how David Archer wanted to start his head coaching tenure up in Ithaca. Assuming Dartmouth is able to bounce back from last week’s last-minute loss to Harvard, it looks like next week’s battle for New York will pit two winless Ivy teams against each other. Better buy your tickets now!
Pick: Dartmouth 41, Cornell 31

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 0-3-1 start does not usually describe a soccer squad poised to make a title run. Yet that was where the Harvard women’s team stood a week into the season.
The Crimson players could have begun to doubt themselves. After all, the last Harvard team to go winless in its first four contests finished the year with a dismal 3-13-1 record and dwelt near the Ivy League cellar.
But coach Ray Leone had faith in his talneted team when others may have not.
“I thought there was a lot of potential with this group,” Leone said. “And as long as we weren’t concerned with the results [early on], I knew we were going to be fine…. We learned a lot by making mistakes and losing those early games.”
Taking the silver lining from the inauspicious start, neither captain Peyton Johnson nor freshman forward Midge Purce thought to question the team or the coaching staff.
“It was a blessing in disguise,” Johnson said. “We were upset about the results, but at the same time, there was so much belief within the team and from the coaches that we were a good team…. We never let down and [the losses] only drove us to train harder and come out stronger.”
“We played some really good teams in the beginning, but never were our heads down,” Purce added. “The more you play with someone…the better you are as a team.”
As confident as Leone, Johnson, and Purce may have been at the time, it’s hard to believe that they ever envisioned the story that unfolded. Even after earning its first victory of the year—a 1-0 win over LIU Brooklyn—the Crimson didn’t look like a team about to pull off one of the longest streaks in program history.
But eleven games later, Purce was leading the Ivy League with 16 goals and 26 points and had an Ivy League Player of the Week award under her belt, the first Harvard freshman to earn the honor since 1991.
Eleven games later, the Crimson still had not lost since the opening week and had only given up seven goals during the streak.
And eleven games later, Harvard would be celebrating its 11th Ivy League title.
“I don’t think I can [describe it],” Purce said. “ I think the best thing is that we worked hard for it in practice and on and off the field.”
The Crimson captain had a hard time processing the team’s sudden success.
“[If someone had told me where we would be at the end of the season,] oh gosh…I wouldn’t have believed [it],” Johnson laughed. “At the start of every season you know that so many things could go so many ways…. It would not have been on my list of first five guesses.”
At the end of a rough first week, an Ivy League title probably wasn’t on anyone’s list of possible outcomes. But the group was ready to take on the challenge head-on without worrying about the past.
“What’s remarkable about the 11 [games] is that in everyone’s mind we were able to make it eleven one-game stretches,” Johnson said. “After we’d win or tie, we wouldn’t dwell on it very long…. The reason we could have a streak like the one we had was because we didn’t treat it like one.”
Though the outcome was different, the input had been the same throughout the season.
“We faced some tough opponents [early on], but each game we learned something about ourselves as a team and about the teams we’d be facing in the future,” junior goaltender Cheta Emba said. “Once we started winning, I guess that was the turnaround. But it’s been a journey from the beginning.”
With victory after victory, the Crimson maintained its focus and did not get caught up in its own success. But the post-championship celebration huddle gave Harvard players a chance to step back and admire how far they’d come.
“For the first time this season, [Coach Leone] let us reflect for a second,” Johnson said. “Once we had that trophy in our hands, he let us think about how awesome those last six games in the Ivy League had been…and he let us be proud of that.”
But midway through his talk, Leone brought the group back to the present, looking ahead towards its final Ivy match at Columbia this weekend. There the Crimson will be shooting for its first perfect league record since 1999, the year it had its last 13 game unbeaten streak, as well.
“[Going undefeated] is really a dream, not so much a goal,” Leone said. “The goal is to win the Ivy League, and if you can pull off a 7-0 [league record], then that’s impressive, and we have a tough team to play to see if we can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some squads might be intimidated to start their season against the DePaul women’s basketball team in the first-round of the DePaul Maggie Dixon Classic, which kicks off this Friday on the Blue Demons’ home court. The DePaul women enter the season fresh off an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament and are the preseason pick to win the newly redesigned Big East Conference.
Being intimidated, however, isn’t really the Harvard women’s basketball team’s style.
“Our expectation is [that] we’re going to win,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We’re going in with the expectation that we can compete and we have an ability to win this tournament.”
The Crimson enters the season ranked second in the Ivy League preseason poll, after losing just two starters from a squad that went to the second round of the WNIT for the second straight year after going 20-8 in the regular season. After a five year drought without a title, however, the team is starting the 2013-14 season with a new mindset.
“We have really tried to focus every single practice on what we call ‘excellent’,” junior co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “Focusing on the little things and working towards our goals of getting excellence every single practice has really brought a new focus and energy to our team. Everyone’s really committed to each other and supporting each other, and I think that that common goal and focus and intensity has a different feel than it has in the past.”
The returners are highlighted by co-captain Christine Clark and juniors Temi Fagbenie and Ali Curtis, who combined to score 31.1 points and grab 14.5 rebounds per game last season. After losing senior Victoria Lippert, who added 13.7 PPG last year and was always a reliable scoring threat, the team will be looking to its experienced starters and senior class to step up and make an impact on the court.
“Obviously Christine Clark has been one of our leading scorers for years,” Dinkins said. “She plays a huge role but I think some of the seniors who have been supporting roles in the past will really step up and dominate. Ali is back at starting point guard better than ever. She’s really leading our team and I think that she’ll play a commanding role on the court.”
DePaul comes into the 2013-14 season with high expectations after losing to Oklahoma State in the first round of the NCAA tournament last year. Led by coach Doug Bruno, entering his 28th season at the helm, the Blue Demons received votes in both the AP and USA Today preseason polls and are currently ranked just outside the Top-25 nationally.
“He’s been coaching as long as I have and he’s phenomenal at DePaul, so I’m going in with my eyes open,” said Smith, who is entering her 32nd season as the head coach in Cambridge. “I know how he coaches and how good he is. We’re expecting a very physical game. Every year he has athletic players: they’re going to be very aggressive, they’re going to run, so we have to be ready for that kind of game.”
The Blue Demons are highlighted by senior Jasmine Penny and junior Brittany Hrynko. Penny, who averaged 12.8 points and 4.9 rebounds per game last year, was named to the All-Big East preseason squad, while Hrynko was tabbed as the conference preseason Player of the Year after a stellar sophomore effort in which she added 14.7 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.
“She’s a terrific player, and you don’t go in trying to shut her down totally because I don’t think you can shut that kind of player down,” Delaney-Smith said. “But we certainly have a strategy and a game plan. You want to minimize her easy opportunities; you want to make everything she does challenging.”
If the Crimson succeeds in taking down DePaul on Friday, they will face the winner of the CalPoly-Duquesne matchup the next day. While both teams are also coming off successful seasons of their own, the team is confident in their ability to do well this weekend.
“We’re really just trying to define Harvard basketball and play our game,” Dinkins said. “We want to not let any opponent determine the style of play, but really play our type of basketball every time. They’re a great team, but we’ve prepared and I think if we follow the scouting and go in with the mindset that we’re going to dominate, it will allow us to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Crimson women’s basketball team faced Princeton for the first time last season, they lost 67-51. The team entered the locker room frustrated after the tough loss, ready to hear its senior leaders and captains give their critique. But then-sophomore Kaitlyn Dinkins started talking.
Although she hadn’t played a minute in the game, her teammates listened intently as Dinkins offered the squad her own words of encouragement. No one uttered a sound as she brought herself to tears, emphasizing the endless possibilities the team still had in front of them.
“[The game] was so disheartening,” Dinkins said. “Because I was so emotional, and so passionate about it, I forget what I said. I remember everyone sitting there and realizing that was it. At that moment, I felt appreciated by my team and knew my leadership had grown a lot.”
Fast forward to the end of the season and Dinkins, who averaged 5.4 minutes a game, was selected as co-captain for the 2013-2014 campaign. Despite the relative lack of time competing on the court, neither her teammates nor her coach was the least bit surprised.
“Even though she doesn’t have the stats, even though she hasn’t played much in her career, she leads by example just as much as I do, just as much as anybody on the team,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “It just doesn’t necessarily happen during games, but during practice, all of her teammates know that Kaitlyn is always going to give 110 percent and they strive to match that effort level.”
Dinkins came to the Crimson after leading Pace Academy High School to the Georgia state championship game for the first time in program history. As the captain of a small private high school basketball team, Dinkins learned to lead and developed the skills she hopes to use to guide the Crimson this season.
“People were there for different reasons,” Dinkins said. “I learned how to communicate and cater to different learning styles and adjust my leadership skills to their responses to what I was saying. Emotion and talk has always been my thing. I like to get people motivated and riled up and ready to play.”
Although Dinkins was surprised when she was named captain, she recognizes the effect her contributions from the bench have had on her team during the past two years.
“I’m a person who has a lot of energy and likes to get other people motivated,” Dinkins said. “Every time there’s a huge play or we need a stop on defense, we start cheering on the bench, running up and down and giving each other high fives. I think that that energy is just so contagious on the court.”
Her teammates can attest to the enthusiasm Dinkins generates and the important role she plays on a daily basis by passing along that passion and energy to the rest of the team.
“I think she’s going to continue to hold us accountable and make sure we’re holding our other teammates accountable for giving 110 percent,” junior forward Erin McDonnell said. “She has so much grit. That’s a great word to describe her as a player and her pure love for Harvard women’s basketball…. She wants us to be Ivy League champions and to be successful because she loves us as players and people.”
Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith recognizes many of those same qualities in her co-captain and appreciates the example she sets for the rest of the team.
“Her work ethic, her leadership…she can listen, she can process, and she can implement,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s fundamentally sound, she’s loved and admired by every single person in this program, and that’s the heart and soul of our program.”
Even if Dinkins can’t always be on the court alongside her fellow co-captain Clark, she knows her contributions will be just as valuable in other areas.
“We have two captains managing both sides of the game, which is awesome,” Dinkins said. “Obviously, I want to be on the court. I love playing basketball. I just have to keep in mind that whatever my role is is whatever is best for the team and that’s how it has to be. People always look to me for energy, talk, and getting people going. No matter if I don’t play, my effort and attitude are going to be the same the whole time.”
Clark acknowledges Dinkins’ leadership as a main asset to the team’s focus and morale, saying that the junior can lead with her words, as well her play.
“Everyone has a high level of respect for Kaitlyn,” Clark said. “If she puts the team first, everyone else is going to put the team first. Everyone else is going to be more unselfish and not get down about not playing.”
Dinkins might not have the numbers to back up her success, but her coach won’t deny this player’s ability to lead her team.
“She is a player with a tremendous court IQ who you can call on to fill any role,” Delaney-Smith said. “And I’m not going to say Kaitlyn’s going to play or not play, but I’m going to tell you that if you need a solid player that can do exactly what she’s told without mistakes, Kaitlyn is probably the best on the team at that.”
After two seasons wearing a Crimson jersey, the Atlanta, Ga., native appreciates the time she has already spent on the team and anxiously anticipates this season.
“It’s been so much more than I could have ever imagined,” Dinkins said. “We go at it really hard on the court. It’s a competition, but it’s all so we can make each other better. Off the court, we have each other’s backs. The commitment everyone has is so different than anything I’ve ever experienced. We all want to be there every day.”

Thinking back on it, co-captain Laurent Rivard cannot remember exactly how he began to code.
“I actually never figured that out,” Rivard said. “Maybe from my mom. I took some classes in high school, and ever since, I knew I wanted to do that.”
Rivard’s passion for coding is unique on the Harvard men’s basketball team. No other player on the squad is a computer science concentrator. The late-week problem set due dates and all-nighter ethos of the field make it a hard balancing act with varsity sports.
During the year, when Rivard often has to travel for Friday and Saturday games, he said that to balance the load he must begin work almost as soon as he receives an assignment—staying ahead in school and on the court.
“It’s harder during the season because we definitely have to travel, and the whole time in general it is very hard,” Rivard said. “Every assignment, I try to start early and work on it a couple hours every day so I can figure it out. I have to start all of the assignments early and can’t wait to the end to work on them.”
Rivard’s coding career thus far has centered around his work with the iOS application development platform. The senior’s strongest coding language, Objective C, is the base of all iPhone app development, and he already has two apps to his name, with a third on the way.
The first, written for his Computer Science 164: Software Engineering class, helps to coordinate fitness routines. According to the Quebec native, the app closely monitors a workout and stops and starts music to help create a routine in the gym.
The second, written last weekend with two fellow seniors at the Harvard Public Safety Innovation Hackathon during a 30-hour coding marathon, warns citizens about crime in their area and allows citizens to report crime more easily. According to Rivard, the app, called Crimesource, provides students in dangerous areas easy access to emergency phone lines.
“It tracks you at night, between 8pm and 5am, and once you enter an area where there has been a lot of crime—like above the city average—it will tell you so you are aware you are in a dangerous area and to let you know if you need to turn around,” Rivard said. “If you turn on the app, there is a button so that you can call the local emergency center. For Harvard campus, it will call HUPD.”
Rivard’s biggest project, however, is an ongoing effort with two Dartmouth collaborators. The application is still in development, but the senior is targeting something he has quite a bit of experience with—the fan experience at college basketball games.
“It has been really challenging but also really fun so far,” Rivard said. “We are just trying to enhance the fan experience for fans. The app will let you check in at every game that you go to, adding in certain players and teams to let you follow them.”
Other features of the app include connecting fans at each game with one another through social media, allowing them to get a sense of the crowd mood throughout the game. Fans will also be able to make micro-donations to the team of their choice during the contest.
Rivard said that one of the most appealing parts of coding is the way in which it is both individualistic and team-oriented. Although computer science is ultimately the product of steady work spent honing the craft on one’s own—much like the private shooting sessions Rivard uses to develop his basketball game and, in particular, his three-point shot—teamwork is integral to success on larger projects.
“It is something you can do [both] on your own at night and in a team setting,” Rivard said. “It is fun to do something very different than basketball. It is really interesting to tackle a challenging problem and try to come up with the best solution. What is really cool is when you get a new idea and you can use it to solve big problems. That is when the coolest things can happen.”
With the time that he devotes to basketball, Rivard said that he appreciates the ways that coding is both similar and different than his on-court game.
Especially in the middle of the season, he said, coding provides a good change-of-pace from the Ivy League season.
“Like [in basketball], you are definitely working with a team setting, and you definitely have to go out and work together, especially when you are coding next to them,” Rivard said. “[That said,] I think it is pretty different than basketball, and that is part of why I enjoy it so much.”

Surgery.
For an athlete, this one word has the power to ruin an entire career. For sophomore guard Shilpa Tummala, it has been an ongoing battle over the past year and a half to beat this setback.
A two-time captain at St Mary’s High School in Phoenix, Ariz., Tummala was ESPN’s No. 69 recruit in the nation and had led her team, ranked No. 1 in the country by ESPN, to two straight state titles. With these accomplishments under her belt, it seemed only natural that Tummala would continue this streak of success during her Harvard career. Furthermore, there were high preseason expectations that she would make an impact in her very first season on the Crimson squad.
Before even stepping onto the floor for Harvard, Tummala was voted both College Sports Madness preseason Mid-Major Freshman of the Year and preseason Ivy League Freshman of the Year. Without notching a single stat, Tummala made waves as she claimed huge honors in the women’s basketball circuit.
However, a storm was brewing for the rookie. Tummala was dealing with chronic shoulder dislocations that were continuing to worsen. In her freshman season, rather than racking up stats and gathering honors like she had been predicted to, Tummala was unable to give the game her all as she dealt with these debilitating issues. In flashes of what could have been, the guard sunk two threes and went four-for-four from the floor to notch 10 points in her Ivy debut against Dartmouth in January. But there was trouble in paradise—the shoulder problems continued to build up until the inevitable occurred. Tummala was going to need surgery.
“I had two major incidents where [the shoulder] completely dislocated,” Tummala said. “I couldn’t do anything else but get the surgery.”
With no other option, Tummala went ahead with the procedure and had to watch from the sidelines as her teammates moved on in their season without her.
“It was rough,” Tummala said. “Anyone with an injury can tell you that they kind of feel that they are separated from the team. You have to find a way to stay connected with the team even though you’re sidelined.”
The drills that Tummala usually excelled in were out of the picture as her athletic activity became defined by rehabilitation exercises and workouts tailored to her limitations. Even more frustrating for the guard was her inability to give her team the performance she had been nationally recognized for in preseason predictions.
“I think that was the most difficult part, feeling like I couldn’t contribute to the team as much as I wanted to,” Tummala said. “It was a mental struggle for me.”
However, she wasn’t facing the challenge alone.
“All of my teammates and coaches were really supportive,” Tummala said. “The training staff was phenomenal. With their help, I met all my recovery checkpoints on or before I was supposed to hit them.”
The combined efforts of her support system has paid off, and Tummala is poised to make her comeback this year. Once again, her presence on the squad is expected to make a huge impact.
“She’s a big, strong, powerful, smart guard,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “You don’t always find all those things in one body. She has one of the greatest three-point shots in the country. She has a very high court IQ, and she is one of the most remarkable passers that I will ever coach.”
With the loss of several key seniors last year, such as top-scoring guard Victoria Lippert ‘13, Tummala’s return to the team is made all the more crucial.
“I’m not going to ask any one person to fill those shoes [of the graduated seniors],” Delaney-Smith said. “But Shilpa clearly can help with some of those points.”
And this is exactly what Tummala hopes to do in the coming season.
“I want to be confident and bring good energy and have a presence that builds my team up,” Tummala said. “Whatever the coaches and my teammates expect of me, I hope to fulfill that role.”
It is undeniable that Tummala enters this season with her fair share of obstacles and pressure, as she will fight to maintain her progress in her recovery and bring a dynamic presence to the Crimson squad. Although this is bound to be a challenge, Tummala is keeping her fundamental goals in sight.
“Even in my comeback, I have the feeling of not being able to do everything at my 100 percent and having to still build up to my 100 percent.” Tummala said. “But I’m always keeping the perspective that I’m blessed to be able to play with such a great group of girls and a coaching staff that is so supportive of me doing well this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard men’s basketball team upset No. 3 New Mexico in the first round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament, the celebration was on in Salt Lake City. The players stormed the court at EnergySolutions Arena, but they were not the only ones celebrating.
Three high school seniors, spread out across the country, were just as excited as the men playing in Utah. Six months later, those seniors are now the newest members of the Crimson squad.
Headlining the incoming freshman class is Zena Edosomwan, a 6’9” forward from Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles. Edosomwan had been watching the game with his father and could not believe the result.
“I was just so happy for those guys because I don’t think a lot of people expected them to do that,” Edosomwan said. “That was just very special, knowing that those would be the guys that [I’d] be able to play with next year.”
Edosomwan, listed as the No. 76 prospect in the Class of 2013 according to Scouts Inc., is the most highly touted recruit to ever join the Crimson. The forward averaged 16.4 points and 11.5 rebounds per game in his senior season, earning him a McDonald’s All-American nomination.
Almost 40 different schools offered scholarships to the Harvard-Westlake senior in 2012, including UCLA, USC, Texas, and California. But Edosomwan had his heart set on joining the Crimson.
“Here at Harvard, it’s something really special because you have an elite academic institution that’s well recognized globally,” Edosomwan said. “The opportunity to be a part of that, from a student’s point of view, and also to represent the university as an athlete, I felt was something I couldn’t pass up.”
However, getting to Cambridge was not an easy process for the young forward. Edosomwan’s SAT scores came up just short of the qualifications for admission set by the university when he took the test in 2012. But he would not give up his dream.
Rather than accept an offer from another school, Edosomwan decided to reclassify as a 2013 prospect and spend a year at Northfield Mount Hermon, a reputable prep school in Western Massachusetts, before joining the Crimson.
One year later, after leading his school to a national championship and having qualified for admission to Harvard, Edosomwan has found his way onto the court for the Crimson.
Joining Edosomwan as a new addition to the Harvard frontcourt is Hunter Myers, a 6’7” forward from Douglas High School in Minden, Nev. The forward was in the middle of practice when the Crimson was in action against the Lobos, but he still remembers the game.
“I was only briefly getting score updates during my water breaks,” Myers said. “[But] I would be jumping with joy every time I saw Harvard lead.”
Myers brings plenty of winning experience with him to Cambridge, as his high school team won back-to-back Sierra League titles in his junior and senior seasons.
In his senior year, the forward averaged over 18 points and 10 boards per game, earning him the title of Northern Nevada Player of the Year. However, Myers is still looking to find his role in the Crimson rotation.
“I really see myself as being able to play whatever role [Harvard] Coach [Tommy Amaker] puts me in,” Myers said. “I’m not going to try to define my own role because I’m really trying to fit into the team’s system at this point.”
The Nevada native received offers from several schools all over the map, from Ivy League rival Princeton to the University of California. But Myers says he knew when he got to the Harvard campus on his official visit last year that he would be heading east.
“I really felt the camaraderie [among the team] coming in even on my visit, and that really carried over to this year,” Myers said. “It seems like, for myself, I really made the correct choice.”
Rounding out the rookies is Matt Fraschilla, a 5’11” point guard out of Highland Park High School in Dallas, Texas.
Fraschilla was born into a basketball family. He grew up competing on the court against his older brother James, who is currently a guard at the University of Oklahoma. His father, Fran, used to be a college basketball coach and now serves as a broadcaster for ESPN.
The rookie guard has a very unique perspective on last year’s tournament game. One of the schools where his father coached? The University of New Mexico.
“That was funny how that worked out,” Fraschilla said. “My parents were out of town, so I watched that one by myself. I was kind of freaking out in my house when they pulled off the upset.”
While Matt had the last laugh on that night, the point guard credited his father for the majority of the success that he has had on the basketball court.
“He’s taught me almost everything I know,” Fraschilla said. “From a young age, I kind of learned to play the game the right way because of him.”
Fraschilla was the captain of his team at Highland Park during his senior season, and he led the squad with 8.1 assists per game. Amaker was a point guard himself at Duke University, which Fraschilla admitted was a huge selling point when he was making his decision about where to go last spring.
In addition to Amaker, Fraschilla will have the leaders of the Crimson backcourt, senior Brandyn Curry and sophomore Siyani Chambers, to lean on throughout the season.
“Going against them every day in practice, it’s been awesome,” Fraschilla said. “You know, sometimes you go out there and you get your butt kicked, [but] that’s just part of it…. If I was going to learn under two point guards, I couldn’t ask for two better ones.”
After a successful 20-win season in 2012-13, Harvard only lost one senior to graduation, forward Christian Webster, who is still with the team as an assistant coach. With more newcomers to the team than shoes to be filled, minutes may be tough to come by early on for the freshmen.
However, Amaker is happy with the depth that his three newest additions will provide the team over the course of the year.
“They’re learning, but if you’re going to work hard and try to fit in, you’re going to do just fine,” Amaker said. “I’m very comfortable and confident in what they’ve done so far.”
The 2017 class has only been practicing with the team for a few months now, but the players have already begun to make significant contributions on the court. Crimson Madness, held on Oct. 18 at Lavietes Pavilion, offered the rookies their first taste of action in front of the home crowd.
Edosomwan stole the show, putting up 16 points for the Crimson squad in a 36-31 win over the Black squad, which featured Myers and Fraschilla coming off the bench. Additionally, Edosomwan participated in the dunk contest, and Myers competed in the three-point shooting contest.
Just one exhibition into the season, Edosomwan, Myers, and Fraschilla have all begun to prove that they are capable of going a long way as a unit in the years to come.
“We’ve built a really strong bond,” Fraschilla said. “You know we have three more years after this one to continue to grow that friendship, and it’s going to be really cool.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bumps and bruises will not stop coach Kathy Delaney-Smith this year. After an era in which Princeton dominated the Ivy League for four straight Ancient Eight titles, the Harvard women’s basketball team is ready to wear the crown.
The Crimson enters the 2013-14 campaign following two years of first-round wins in the WNIT despite slews of season-ending injuries. Health, Delaney-Smith stresses, will be essential to league success.
“I love how everyone came back this summer,” Delaney-Smith said. “No excuses, but we’ve had a series of season-ending, and even career-ending, injuries ... that really kept us playing at about 50 percent for some athletes.”
Harvard returns three of its five starters following the graduation of forward Miriam Rutzen ’13 and guard Victoria Lippert ’13. Rutzen, a co-captain last year, provided power on the glass with an average of nearly six rebounds per game. Lippert was the team’s second-leading scorer with 13.7 points per game and displayed an ability to make shots when they counted most—especially at the charity stripe.
But whatever the team has lost, it has gained experience and fresh blood. Junior guard Ali Curtis will return to her job as floor general with a year of starts to her name after effectively having her sophomore season be her rookie year. Curtis will be a force in league competition if she reduces turnovers that were sometimes costly for the team.
“I think my role on the team has become more of a dominant presence as far as directing and calling the plays and leading from the point guard position,” Curtis said. “I think that having a year under my belt is going to help me and thus, in turn, help the team.”
Co-captain Christine Clark will anchor the shooting effort for her squad as the top-scoring player on the team, and returns to the court with an even sharper approach to the game.
“[Clark is] creating for her teammates,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s very versatile. She can shoot the three, she can pull up, she can draw the foul… She’s got a lot of ways to score.”
Rounding out the trio of veterans is junior forward Temi Fagbenle. The team’s tallest member at 6’4”, the 2012 Olympian is the most efficient from the floor, hitting nearly 60 percent of her field goals.
Along with a propensity to snatch rebounds—over seven per game—Fagbenle occasionally struggled with letting her height get the best of her last season and was called for 55 fouls over 29 games, the most of a forward on the team.
Competition is certainly rife to fill the two empty starting spots, as new, recovered, and improved members of the team will jostle for starting roles.
“I definitely think that our entire team is capable of starting,” Curtis said. “It’s funny because you don’t hear a lot of people say that, but we have such a deep team. The fact that we have to fill those two positions won’t be an issue at all because any of the players on the team could technically fill them.”
Sophomore Shilpa Tummala, who entered Harvard with lofty expectations as a nationally regarded recruit, will return this year as a versatile shooting guard with impressive agility at 5’11” and a talent for making shots. Tummala—once the runner-up at the National High School Three-Point Shooting competition—put up 10 points in her Ivy League debut in January against Dartmouth before suffering a season-ending injury.
Hoping to fill the void left by Rutzen and co-captain Emma Golen in the frontcourt are junior forward Erin McDonnell, senior center Elise Gordon, and sophomore forward AnnMarie Healy. Healy and McDonnell contributed to the Crimson off the bench last year while Gordon sat out much of the conference season with an injury.
Delaney-Smith’s job this year will be to guide all this talent into an Ivy League machine, one that looks to continue its success against the rival Tigers. Harvard showed flashes of brilliance in its historic win over Princeton in March that ended the Tigers’ 33-game Ancient Eight win streak. In the contest, Lippert knocked down a crucial 10 of 10 foul shots and combined with Clark for 35 points. Harvard defenders held two-time Ivy League Player of the Year Niveen Rasheed to a season-low 26 percent from the field.
“Everybody seems to be healthier, stronger, and motivated by our end-of-the-season beating of Princeton,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think we will garner a lot of confidence from that.”
With Rasheed and several other instrumental Princeton players gone, the title may finally be Harvard’s for the taking.
“I think we’ll be the team to beat this year,” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team’s front line consisted of three players who had played a combined 638 minutes in their college careers. Who would start down low was anyone’s guess, with only one returning big man having averaged double-digit minutes the season prior.
Over the course of the season, then-sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi, Kenyatta Smith, and Jonah Travis more than doubled their total minutes, points, rebounds, and blocks from the 2011-12 campaign. They combined for the best block-per-game average in the Ivy League and held their own against more athletic and bigger front-lines in the NCAA tournament.
In short, the big men stepped up.
After last year’s breakout season, the trio will look to do the same in the 2013-14 season. This time, however, they’ll have help.
With the arrival of 6’9” freshman Zena Edosomwan and the return of 6’7” senior Kyle Casey, the team now features a front line at least five men deep. And for a team that placed seventh in the nation in three-point field goal percentage last year, the surplus of size will serve as a welcome and formidable offensive complement.
“We definitely have more weapons [this year],” Smith said. “We were able to fit [the newcomers] right into the rotation….  When we get our rotations set, our offense should be something, in my opinion, to fear. We’re very versatile, deep…[and] there isn’t too much left to be desired chemistry-wise.”
Edosomwan, who notched two McDonald’s All-American nominations and two first-team All-State selections in high school, enters Harvard having averaged a double-double at Northfield Mount Herman School last year. Ranked No. 76 in his recruiting class, Edosomwan chose Harvard over big-name schools like Texas, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and USC.
“Zena brings a low post presence that is unbelievable,” Moundou-Missi said. “He’s strong, athletic, goes strong to the basket, [and] he’s only a freshman.”
Smith echoed his classmate’s sentiments, stressing the physical power of the freshman.
“[Edosomwan is] definitely a back-to-the-basket type player,” Smith explained. “He uses his strength to his advantage, trying to get in [the paint] and get shots as close to the basket as possible, using as much strength as possible.”
Whereas Edosomwan will be donning the Crimson jersey for the first time, veteran Casey will look to continue his past dominance in the paint. Along with leading the team in scoring, Casey was the only player on the 2011-12 squad to average over a block a game, despite being the fifth-tallest player on the roster.
“Kyle is a really great defender,” Moundou-Missi said. “His talk helps us a lot on defense, and he is really the big general of our defense, which helps us a lot. His swagger and his confidence are going to be really big for us this year.”
On the offensive end, Smith said that Casey is unique in his ability to play both back-to-the-basket and face-up games. In addition to being a defensive presence down low, Casey had the second-highest three-point field goal percentage on the team in his junior season, shooting over 35 percent. Smith says that this versatility adds greatly to the big-man dynamic.
Of last year’s returning players, it was Smith whose breakout season was the least expected, at least according to the numbers. After averaging 2.1 minutes and 0.4 points per game in 2011-12, Smith amassed 14.5 minutes and 5.8 points per contest in last year’s campaign. Perhaps most significantly, he climbed from 0.2 to 2.1 blocks per game in that same timespan.
It is his hook shot, however, that Smith has spent the most time improving, a move that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker stressed in the middle of last season.
Whatever words Amaker used to impress the point on Smith, they worked. In arguably the biggest weekend of the season, at home against the Killer P’s, Smith stepped up. In Friday’s game against Penn, he nearly notched a triple-double, totaling 20 points, 10 blocks, and nine rebounds. The next night, against Princeton, he tallied 14 points, seven rebounds, and six blocks without missing a single shot—field goal or free throw.
Smith’s only objective this year, he states, is to be there for his squad.
“My personal goal is to do the best that I can to get this team where it needs to be for where we need to go and want to go,” Smith explained. “Every-day I’m contributing as much as I possibly can to better this team, because we’ve got some big team goals in mind and we know it’s going to take a lot to get there.”
Fellow frontcourt mate Moundou-Missi, who ranked fifth for the Crimson in points per game and third in field goal percentage last year, believes that it is the intangibles that will take his game to the next level in the coming campaign.
“I think the big change in my game is my confidence level,” Moundou-Missi explained. “I feel like this summer I practiced a lot and got confident taking some shots I didn’t take last year. Playing with the [Cameroonian] national team also helped me, for sure, as a player.”
In addition to utilizing his new consistent jump shot, Moundou-Missi stressed the importance of his role on the defensive end, stating that that is where he and the other bigs will have their biggest impact.
Rounding out the 2012-13 big man trio, Travis comes into this season having worked on his mid-range game as well as his post strength. The veteran shot nearly 60 percent last year and, according to Smith, is now a bigger threat to face-up and shoot a pullup.
“Jonah and Steve are both just absolute workhorses,” Smith said. “They both, without a doubt, have the strength to bulldoze their way to the rim, but they’re both quick players too. They’re working on making moves right off the dribble, so they can become a little more perimeter-oriented…. It’s crucial for our team for them to have that confidence [outside the paint].”
With five individually skilled players, it will be finding the right lineups, not talent, that may take some time. Amaker explained that at this point, the coaching staff is unsure of what the minute distribution is going to be or how deep they will go into the bench. Finding the right combination between the five, he believes, will be crucial.
“I think one of the keys of the season will be the consistency of our front line,” Amaker said. “That’s the area that could help carry this team to a different level. That’s what we’re hoping for…. That’s the key group for the ball club this season.”
Already, both Smith and Moundou-Missi have voiced their approval of how the post players are gelling. Smith said the dynamic is going “very well” and “can only get better from here,” while Moundou-Missi described the five as “a good mix.”
With a five-month season ahead, it seems that the squad already understands how essential the five big men will be.
“If we can get consistent performances from our group of front line players,” Amaker said, “not [just from] one guy, [but from] a group of guys, I really like the opportunity of this team to have a special year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Take a look at Christine Clark’s high school athletic accomplishments, and you might not immediately know which sport she was recruited for.
The Tucson native, who had run track since fourth grade, picked up hurdles her junior year of high school, winning a state championship in the 300-meter that same season. The following year, she added the 100-meter hurdles state championship—as well as the 300-meter hurdles again—to her belt.
Yet you won’t find Clark, now a senior at Harvard, on the track roster.
“I just started playing basketball in seventh grade and loved it, so going into high school, that was my number one focus,” Clark said. “Harvard actually wanted me to run for them, and I said ‘no thank you.’ I think the people who do two sports are incredible, but I only did other sports in high school to cross train for basketball, and I can’t really do that in college because here, basketball’s full time.”
That focus has led Clark to where she is now—a four-year starter and co-captain of a Harvard women’s basketball team that won the first WNIT game in the Crimson’s history when Clark was a sophomore and is now poised to challenge for the Ivy League title this year.
Clark played for the Arizona Elite club team in high school and began getting recruited during her junior year by a number of  Division I programs. After taking official visits to Kansas State and DePaul University, Clark—ranked by ESPN during high school as the 55th best point guard in the country—visited Harvard.
“I had 20 plus D-I offers, and I think academically Harvard is unmatched, but I also just fell in love with the style and the coaching program on my official visit,” Clark said. “[Coach] Kathy [Delaney-Smith] is just an amazing person, and through my four years has developed me so much on and off the court as a person, and I don’t think I would have gotten that anywhere else.”
Now, entering her final season as a guard on Harvard’s team, the senior looks to bring home the Ancient Eight title, a feat the team has not accomplished since the 2006-07 season.
“We’ve come in second place [each of] my three years here, and my goal this year is to really figure out the path to keep the team consistent and keep us striving towards excellence, and in that goal, I think that an Ivy League Championship will result,” Clark said.
Clark may be new to the role of captain, but leadership on the court is not unfamiliar for the senior. Last season, Clark led the team in scoring—averaging 15.6 points per game—and often took on the role of floor leader while on the court.
But the improvement in her game has, if anything, caused her to work even harder. Over the past summer, while also working 30 hours a week in a cancer lab and getting her research published, Clark put in five hours every day in the gym to expand her skill set.
“Where she found the time to bring her game to this new level, I don’t know,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has a lot of ways to score, [but] the one way she needed to grow was to create for teammates and deliver the ball when she drew the double or the triple team, and she’s there now. It’s just an added dimension that will make this team better, and she’ll probably score more, believe it or not.”
Even off the court, Clark is never far removed from basketball.
Along with fellow co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins, Clark puts together volunteer events with various organizations to get the team involved with community service.
“We packed bags for the Walk for Breast Cancer—Kathy’s a big supporter of that—and we went down and just spent time packing bags on the assembly line for all the runners that were going to run,” Clark said. “We have other things planned with the Boys and Girls Club, and we’re definitely going to be more involved with them as far as getting them out to practices and trying to build different relationships with those kids, because they’re not necessarily in the best place.”
In addition to her duties as co-captain, Clark spends time researching the avenue she wants to pursue following graduation—professional basketball.
The path is not unfamiliar to Harvard basketball alumnae—former Crimson guard Emily Tay ’09 took her talents to Germany after a successful collegiate career.
“I want to play wherever I can, so if I can play in the WNBA, I want to play there, and I want to pursue playing overseas in Europe, but I can’t really do too much because of NCAA rules, so a lot of that is going to happen once the season’s over,” Clark said.
But for now, the senior is focusing on the upcoming season and leading her team to the elusive Ivy League title, one which Princeton has had its grip on for four years running.
“Even if I weren’t going to play professionally, I’d still have that desire to finish strong,” Clark said. “I’m still going to keep working hard and keep getting in the gym, and I think that things will happen from that extra work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year away, when seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry first stepped onto the floor of Lavietes Pavilion, there were no fans, only memories.
Announcing themselves to the Ivy League as freshmen against Brown with a combined 48 points on 19 shots... Curry’s back-to-back double-doubles against Penn and Princeton sophomore year, helping Harvard clinch its first-ever share of the Ivy League title... Casey’s monster 26 point, 10 rebound double-double effort junior year against St. Joseph’s, single-handedly willing the Crimson to a 74-69 victory... Their combined 23 points in the 67-63 Ancient Eight championship-clinching win over Cornell later that year, bringing the Crimson to its first-ever NCAA tournament.
“I had spent so much time there throughout the years, and we had done so much on that floor,” Curry said. “It was definitely a weird feeling, being there at Lavietes with these guys who are ready to do it with us [again].”
Fifteen months ago, Curry and Casey were preparing to leave on the team’s summer trip to Italy when they got an email from the Harvard Administrative Board. It said that they were included in an ongoing investigation into academic dishonesty on a Government 1310 take-home exam.
Students found guilty would have to withdraw and forfeit a year of eligibility—Curry and Casey’s last. Curry told the Charlotte Observer he lived out of a duffel bag until he decided whether or not to take that risk. In early September, he and Casey withdrew—among their fellow students, their names were the only ones publicly released in connection to the ongoing investigation. Curry returned home to sell insurance in his year off, and Casey worked for the 3PointFoundation, assisting inner-city children on both their grades and jumpers.
In their absence, the team surpassed all expectations. Then-freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, expected to back up Curry, won Ivy League Rookie of the Year and became the first freshman ever to make the All-Ivy First Team. Junior wing Wesley Saunders, a role player in 2011-12, co-led the league in scoring and steals. In March, the team shocked the highly-favored New Mexico Lobos in the second round of the NCAA tournament for Harvard’s first ever tournament win. Casey and Curry watched from afar, texting congratulations to the team they had been poised to captain.
A year later, the two seniors are back on campus to anchor a team surrounded by hype. The team was a unanimous pick to win the Ivy League; CBS analyst Seth Davis tweeted that it has Final Four talent. The Crimson returns six All-Ivy selections from the last two years; no other squad returns more than two.
“The expectations are going to be much higher,” Curry said. “We are going to have people coming after us this year.”
For Curry and Casey, however, the focus at the beginning of the year was not on the team’s Nov. 10 season opener against Holy Cross, but on integrating themselves back into campus.
“It was a bit different, at first, being gone for a year, but once you get back into classes and practice things fall back into schedule,” Curry said. “Now that I’m back, I realize how valuable time is. I’m trying to make the best use of the time I have [left].”
On the team, Curry and Casey have fit in as though they never left.
“They’ve done a terrific job of returning with the attitude of working hard and fitting in,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They want to be part of this team, not just be who they were when they left.”
Assistant coach Christian Webster ’13 compared Casey to Kevin Garnett, citing his shot-blocking abilities and low-post presence. Chambers said that the two seniors have been leaders since day one for the Crimson. “He’s come in and been the vocal leader that we needed on the floor,” Chambers said. “Team chemistry, both on and off the court, is great.”
In a vote of confidence from his team, Curry was elected co-captain alongside incumbent senior Laurent Rivard. Although Casey wasn’t named captain, Rivard said that both he and Curry continue to lead by example on the hardwood and in the weight room.
“They bring a lot of experience and maturity to the team,” Rivard said. “They are powerful guys, and [they bring] the experience that we are going to need down the stretch and at the beginning of the season.”
For Chambers, who was thrust into a dual role as the team’s floor general and vocal leader, the return of Curry means a lighter load not only on the floor but in the locker room. The two Crimson point guards, both nominees for the 2014 Bob Cousy Collegiate Point Guard of the Year Award, have flourished separately but will now get the opportunity to play together.
“[We have] a great relationship,” Chambers said. “We’re competitive in practice, but we’re also really good friends outside of practice. Brandyn helped recruit me to Harvard, so I think we have a really good relationship both on and off the court.”
Beyond Chambers and Curry in the backcourt, the team returns its leading scorers from the last two seasons in Saunders and Casey. The returning big man gives Harvard a four-deep rotation at the forward spots, which features an All-Ivy big man in junior Steve Moundou-Missi, a national top-100 recruit in freshman Zena Edosomwan, and the team’s returning center in junior Kenyatta Smith.
“I think that this year, everything will be different from last year,” Casey said. “We are going to have different people on the court, [but] we are going to be pushed like we were last year. I think if we play up to our potential, then we will be absolutely fine.”
Though they were locks for starting roles just a year ago, the two seniors will be competing for time this winter. Defense will be a key determinant for playing time, something that Casey and Curry have excelled at in the past. Both, Rivard said, will provide much-needed depth for a team that had four players average over 33 minutes a game last season.
“We are able to pressure the ball more [with them on the floor],” Rivard said. “Brandyn is a really good on-the-ball defender, and Kyle is a good shot blocker, so we got somebody behind us. On the offensive end, they are both scorers who can score the basketball, and especially for Brandyn, he just adds a lot of depth to the point guard position that we really didn’t have last year.”
When Casey and Curry take the court for the Crimson’s home opener on Nov. 12 against MIT, there won’t be memories on their mind—just unfinished business.

As midterm season round two sneakily morphs into the semester’s home stretch, try not to let work blind you from the remaining days of sunshine. Here’s a list of songs Flyby put together to accompany you through the rest of fall—from crisp struts through the Yard, to cozy cups of tea at your desk.
"Sweater Weather" by The NeighbourhoodThe bigger and comfier the better; bonus points for grandpa buttons. Especially seasonal when paired with a pumpkin spice latte. (Remember, though, the cute $60 sweaters at Urban Outfitters are often $15 a few weeks later.)
"Right as Rain" by AdeleThis catchy, upbeat tune debunking the magnificence of being right reminds us that sometimes it’s ok to get shut down in section. The leaves are falling, it’s ok if you do too.
"Steal My Kisses" by Ben HarperBluesy, folky beatbox-y, bass-y. Added bonuses: if you bob your head as you listen, you might find yourself exceptionally jazzed to walk to your 9:00 a.m. class on a freezing Monday, and the moves might even warm you up.
"Royals" by LordeJust because we said goodbye to the summer doesn’t mean we have to leave its hits behind. Songs can be like Grey Goose and trippin in the bathroom whether the leaves are on the trees or the ground. (Maybe we’re tripping in the bathroom on the leaves someone else dragged in.)
"Hard Candy" by Counting Crows"On certain sundays in November..." let Adam Duritz score your stroll or laundry folding. And don’t worry too much when you conk out halfway through tomorrow’s reading, cause "when you wake the morning covers you with light, and makes you feel alright."
"Jolene" by The WeepiesWherever you are when this song comes on, let your mind stop running for a second. Forget the guy from your freshman entryway who never wants to come to the Quad, or the girl who always says “So good to see you, but I have to run to a meeting, let’s grab a meal soon!” Close your eyes and take a deep breath. The air will be colder soon. Enjoy it while it’s still sweet.
"California" by Joni MitchellSo, we’re not there, but you’ll find the New England air to be much more calming with Joni Mitchell’s breath in your ear. I found it the perfect bread to sandwich Ec 10 midterms.
"Blowin’ in the Wind" by Bob DylanWhether it’s a question of "how many roads" a man must walk down before you can call him a man, or whether turning a train to kill one or five people will get your Justice TF to ask you out, sometimes it’s ok to let the answer keep blowin’ in the autumn wind.
"From the Morning" by Nick DrakeMelancholy and comforting at once, Drake’s strumming is perfect for a quiet night in with a candle and a blanket when one roommate is at a punch event and the other is CS50 p-setting in Lamont. The night falls earlier now, but the air is still beautiful. Open the window. Breathe it in.

There’s something that’s pretty abundant in the daily lives of Harvard students (and no, we’re not talking about p-sets)—acronyms. From HCCG to TF to HUDS, Harvard students might as well speak in acronyms, but we often forget that, to outsiders, they make absolutely no sense.
 
We ventured into Harvard Square to ask some passersby what they thought some of these commonly-used phrases meant. Responses ranged from “I don’t know. We’re from Norway” to “...what?” as well as some pretty legitimate guesses. Here are some below:
 
1. TF (Teaching Fellow)
- “Tusty Fellows.”
- “Technological French?”
 
2. HRO (Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra)
- “Harvard Research Organization.”
- “Harvard Recreational Office.”
- “Harvard Rescue Organization.”
3. HCCG (Harvard College Consulting Group)
- “Harvard Christian Club... Group?”
 - “Harvard College Common Garden.”
- “Harvard Chinese Communist Group?”
- “Harvard Community Service Group! oh wait no... Harvard Community Center Group?”
- “Harvard Center Club Jogging.”
4. HUDS (Harvard University Dining Services)
- “Harvard University Dorm Something...”
- “Harvard University Department Sociologist!”
 
5. DAPA (Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors)
- “Department of the Archives and Professional Allegement?”
- “Department Artist Program Association.”
- “Department Arts... Photography... Allies?”
- “...cool.”
6. IOP (Institute of Politics)
- ”Inter-Orchestra Players”
- ”Investment Organization...People?”
7. UHS (University Health Services)
- “Oh, shoot, I’ve heard of that! Um... University of Harvard System?”
- “U Hit Some.”
- “...Is that a thing?”
- “Under Harvard Studies.”
