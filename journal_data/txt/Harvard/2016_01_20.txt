After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
In the January 19th article, “In Debate Over Names, History and Race Relations Collide,” University President Drew G. Faust is quoted making a number of arguments against renaming buildings and removing symbols across the University which serve to exalt the legacies of slaveholders and traders.
First, her assertion that removal of these names and symbols is somehow tantamount to “erasing” Harvard history is both intellectually lazy and transparently hypocritical. Not too long ago, given the long history of the College, Pforzheimer House was called North House, on a part of the campus which, not too long before that, was a part of Radcliffe College before Harvard admitted women. Things change at Harvard with an unrelenting alacrity, provided only that the skids of those changes are greased with capital. It is pointless and insulting for the President to conflate commercial interests with moral imperatives in this way. For $500 million, Mather House would be renamed The Huey P. Newton Palace of Negro Excellence over winter break. And, of course, the fact that the institution of slavery, which was perpetuated by the namesakes of these buildings, resulted in the actual erasure of generations of black names, family bonds, and cultural ties adds an almost laughably ironic context to her comments.
But what motivated this letter was not President Faust’s failure to frankly address the mercenary realities of how buildings and things get named at Harvard—which is, after all, obvious to everyone. Instead, I was struck by her callous assertion that by passing through each day, and sleeping every night, in buildings named for those who participated in, promoted, and perpetuated chattel slavery, a benefit redounds to black students at Harvard. Specifically, by creating an environment that “… demands enough resilience so as not to require special provisions of safety in the long term ....” This is a truly breathtaking statement.
As 2014’s "I, Too, Am Harvard" campaign clearly showed, black students are not lacking for opportunities to build resilience. To be black and Crimson is to be presented with an unending stream of demands on our capacity for resilience, such that the threat is not that we lose the capacity from lack of use, but rather, that resilience, along with patience,  becomes a depleted resource. In fact, President Faust might, instead, consider whether it is unfair to deprive white Harvard students similar pathways to personal growth. Perhaps she should turn her munificent gaze towards them. By removing some of the most glaring indicia of white supremacy from campus, Harvard could actually help to develop resilience in a portion of its student population most in need of that particular attribute, as the demographics of the country—if not, alas, at Harvard—inexorably change.

A $15 million gift to the Kennedy School of Government will help fund a new cyber security project at the school’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
The gift—funded by investor Robert A. Belfer, his wife Renée, and their son Laurence D. Belfer ’88—brings the Kennedy School’s capital campaign total to $485 million, just short of its $500 million goal. It is one of “the most generous individual gifts” the Kennedy School has received, according to Doug Gavel, a spokesperson for the school.
The new cyber security project will aim to address digital threats to national security. Michael L. Sulmeyer, a former Pentagon official who will direct the project, said the initiative has three goals: produce “top-flight analytic research,” provide Kennedy School students and undergraduates “exposure to cyber security threats and the policy that relates to them,” and create a “fellows program” to analyze and work on issues of cyber security.
Belfer, for whom the Center has been named since 1997, said he made the donation in response to what he perceives as an increased threat of cyberattacks on the United States.
“It’s clear that cyber security at this point is the number one threat to the security of the United States,” Belfer said.
Indeed, cyberattacks have received increased attention in recent years. Last June, at least four million former and current government workers were affected by what appeared to be one of the largest breaches of federal employee data, a hack that seemed to originate in China. Harvard itself suffered a cyber attack last summer, prompting administrators to request that thousands of students and employees change their passwords. Last spring, the website of the Institute of Politics was also hacked, allegedly by a pro-Palestinian group.
According to Belfer, $5 million of the gift will be specifically allocated to the cyber security project. The remaining $10 million will go toward creating a “New Initiatives Fund” that will  support a range of emerging projects and programs beyond cyber security.
Belfer said he hoped the additional money could be directed to a variety of projects and follow-up programs; in particular, he said, he would like to see a program focusing on China.
The Kennedy School publicly launched its portion of the University’s capital campaign in 2014 and supports a number of school-wide initiatives, most notably a major remodeling and expansion of its campus. While fundraising, school administrators have often turned to non-alumni for donations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concentration courses could count for credit in the College’s revamped General Education program, a distinct change from a proposal introduced last fall, should the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approve a finalized version of the program released Tuesday.
Unlike in a draft proposal from December—which explicitly stated that a student’s concentration courses could not count for a distribution requirement included in the new program—the committee wrote that those courses could now fulfill one of the distribution requirements. This crediting system could decrease a student's course load from a total of 8 required courses in the program to 7.

The recommendations, part of a final report from the committee tasked with reviewing the College’s General Education program, are largely unchanged from those described in a draft presented at a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting in December. More detailed than the December draft, though, the final report also describes specific incentives and support that would be provided to faculty and teaching staff within the program.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris emailed the report to College students, and wrote that  FAS faculty will likely vote on the new program later this semester. The current program has been described as “failing on a variety of fronts” and now faces a considerable overhaul.
Under the proposed program, students would be required to take four General Education courses in newly-formed categories and fulfill a distribution requirement by taking courses across the FAS divisions and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Additionally, the College would institute a “quantitative facility” requirement, similar to the current Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed category. The report recommended the formation of a faculty committee to “define the goals of this category in detail,” and said “it also remains possible that a student could place out of the quantitative facility course.” Students would still be still required to fulfill writing and foreign language requirements.
The report also recommends that faculty receive significantly more administrative support if they teach in the program, comparable to the level of support provided to faculty teaching HarvardX courses. The proposal specifically calls for the creation of a Gen Ed-specific IT team, funding to hire a research assistant for course development, a centralized “Gen Ed job listing database” where faculty could find teaching fellows from departments other than their own.
Further, the committee recommended strongly incentivizing the development of Gen Ed courses, suggesting that “one possibility is that great Gen Ed teaching should be a significant factor in awarding Harvard College Professorships,” prestigious positions.
The report reiterates a concern raised in the committee’s preliminary review of the program, released last May, regarding current graduate student funding models. According to the final review, the funding models motivate some faculty to “maximize course enrollments — and corresponding Teaching Fellow positions — as a way to support their Department’s graduate programs.” By contrast, the report reads, other faculty  “have challenges identifying and recruiting qualified graduate students to teach for Gen Ed.”
In the May report, the committee specifically identified faculty in the Arts and Humanities division as having an incentive to teach large Gen Ed courses in order to support their graduate students, while those in the natural sciences  reported “finding it difficult to recruit qualified teaching fellows, as graduate students are generally funded by grants to support research.”
Faculty have largely praised the recommendations of the review committee, which was convened in the spring of 2014. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said he is uncertain when a new Gen Ed program will roll out, though he said  it “would be difficult” to implement it by next fall, given associated administrative changes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Looking to build a new winning streak and stay on pace with ECAC leaders Quinnipiac and Princeton, the No.8/9 Harvard women’s ice hockey team (10-6-1, 7-5-1 ECAC) left the confines of Bright-Landry this weekend to take on conference foes St. Lawrence and No. 5/5 Clarkson.
The Crimson failed to capitalize on its opportunities to pick up key road wins, dropping the first game 2-0 to St. Lawrence (12-10-2, 6-5-1) before losing control in the third frame against Clarkson (19-3-2, 7-3-2) en route to a 5-2 setback.
CLARKSON 5 HARVARD 2
With the game tied going into the final stanza, the Crimson looked to regain the lead after losing it twice earlier. Just over six minutes later, however, Harvard found itself down as junior Corie Jacobson’s shot found twine.
The blueliner’s goal opened the floodgates for the Golden Knights, as senior Olivia Howe doubled the Clarkson lead two minutes later before classmate Renata Fast found a streaking Genevieve Bannon down the right flank, who slipped a shot past Harvard co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer with two minutes left to put the game away, 5-2. The loss marked the fifth straight game against Clarkson without a win for the Crimson.
The Golden Knight defense, which claims the second ranked scoring defense in the conference, held the Crimson offense in check for most of the game. Despite allowing two goals in the first period, Clarkson held Harvard to a mere 19 shots, and only three in the last frame.
The Crimson took the lead early, as sophomore Chelsea Ziadie’s shot from the point bounced off the pads of Clarkson goaltender Shea Tiley. Classmate Lexie Laing quickly redirected the puck into the back of the net to give Harvard the lead.
After pressuring the Crimson goal for almost five minutes, the Golden Knights evened the score as rookie Loren Gabel’s wrist shot from the slot made its way past Maschmeyer, who made 28 saves on the night.
Despite being outshout 11-5 in the first frame, it was Harvard who tallied its second goal of the period as freshman Grace Zarzecki’s scored her eighth goal of the season from the right side.
A back-and-forth second period saw Clarkson even the score once again, as rookie Rhyen McGill redirected a shot from teammate Savannah Harmon into the net. The Crimson failed to take advantage of multiple opportunities in the frame, as the Golden Knights killed the three penalties. With the loss, Harvard slipped to fifth in the ECAC standings.
ST. LAWRENCE 2 HARVARD 0
A pair of first period goals was all St. Lawrence needed to pull off the upset over the Crimson, 2-0, as Harvard was shutout for just the second time all season.
The scoring for the Saints got off to a peculiar start as rookie Lydia Grauer’s slapshot was redirected off the back of sophomore Amanda McClure, leaving Maschmeyer stranded as the puck crept into the net.
St. Lawrence doubled its lead just nine minutes later, as the Crimson failed to kill the power play following a hooking penalty on junior defender Natasha Rachlin. Sophomore Hannah Miller fired a slapshot from the left flank that made its way through a crowd of players and squeezed in between Maschmeyer and the near post. The Saints outshot Harvard 13-9 in the first period.
