After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many filmmakers, inspiration comes from home. Childhood memories and hometown experiences are transformed into cinematic marvels, their central themes found across decades of projects in storytelling. For German American filmmaker Christina Rose — who has spent most of her life, and all of her childhood, moving from place to place — that inspiration often has more complicated roots. As the CEO and co-founder of the production company MirrorWater Entertainment, Rose finds a home for her international outlook in creating films and limited series that focus on social issues from a global perspective. Series like “Wonder Women,” for example, feature individuals from all over the world to showcase their many interconnections. In doing so, Rose says she hopes she is helping to promote acceptance and internationality for her audiences.
The Harvard Crimson sat down with Rose while she was at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival to chat about identity, inspiration, hope, and what’s next for her career. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve had plenty of experience in TV and media across countries. What made you interested in cinema/television?
Christina Rose: I’ve honestly always wanted to work in the film business. As a young kid, I even told my parents. At the time, my mom was like, “No, you’ll never become an actress.” And I was just like, “I don’t want to become an actress. I can work behind the camera.” … I just loved storytelling. I learn through visuals, and I realized that visuals is [also] my medium for [expressing] myself. I wasn’t good at school … language wasn’t my thing, but I loved the arts. And I was able to express myself through images.
I ended up working a little bit in Hollywood, but I really wanted to spend more time on international projects because of [how] I grew up. My dad was in the military for 30 years and we would always move around between the U.S. and Europe. And so I always said, “There’s a lot of content in the international sphere.”
THC: When you say you wanted to express yourself, what specifically did you want to express?
CR: What I’ve heard and seen from really brilliant filmmakers is that it’s about finding your inner voice and the one or two facts about you that [hold] the story that you have to tell within you. Sometimes it’s a specific subject matter or some particular problem you had in your own life. I think, for me, to be very personal and very honest, I’ve always had to fight very hard in order to accomplish something. Either because I’m not the smartest and I had to learn very hard, or because I just had all the cards stacked against me. I’ve failed often, and I have been devastated and depressed. But I’ve also succeeded. … If I can help other people realize that if they don’t give up and if they continue on with their dreams and what it is that they’re inspired to do. Then anything is possible.
I think that’s the type of character that I’m focusing on no matter what it [the project] is.
THC: How has your experience living in so many different countries informed the work you do?
CR: For some reason, I always tend to find global projects. The truth is, I always have to find a [story we can relate to]. My standard rule is we [the filmmakers] have to be able to find something within ourselves to be able to tell a story, because if there’s nothing in it, then why are we telling that story? Somebody else needs to tell that story. If there is something I see of myself in it, or [that my colleagues see], then we go out and search for that. I’ve been lucky enough because I’ve been working in all these different places and meeting all these people that I try to be like, “What’s your talent? How can I help you?” I think I’ve just loved this global environment that I’ve been in. It keeps on nourishing me.
THC: Where do you find the ideas for the stories you’re going to tell?
CR: Sometimes they just morph into it. Speaking specifically of the documentary we just finished, which is called “Wonder Women,” that idea started with my cousin who was from Alaska, visiting my brother who’s my business partner, and telling him about the fact that fisherwomen haven’t really been featured on TV [the way fishermen have]. … The next day, my brother would call me and be like, “I think we have something.” And sure enough, we found out that women in the fishing industry were underrepresented worldwide. And so we decided to develop that more … and as we were going through all these questions that we had, we were just like “Wait, there’s so many other industries where women are underrepresented all over the world. How about we go big on this?” So we started small, and then it became this huge, global, six-part documentary series of women from all over the world, from all different backgrounds in different industries. … We have the fisher woman, we have an astronaut trainee from Germany, we have a racer driver from Hungary, we have a Puerto Rican baseball player in the men’s league, a musical conductor originally from Shanghai, and an Indian pilot.
I feel like it’s also about representation. I think from the whole environment that we’re living in, especially in the U.S., it’s all about representation, about being able to see the faces and the different people who are doing something.
THC: A lot of the media you’ve worked to produce now with MirrorWater — like “Wonder Women,” “Isolation,” and “InGenius” — has a social justice lens to it. What do you think is the role of film and television in engaging with these topics?
CR: When I set up the company with my brother, we were really trying to figure out what’s at the heart of our company and what makes us different from everybody else. And I was so lucky to meet Tom Hanks once at the University of California and he said that for him, the three key elements of good filmmaking is following the three Es: E for entertainment, for educational, and for enlightenment. And the key is enlightenment. It’s the hardest to accomplish because you want to be able to reach your whole audience so that they can still think about what they saw for weeks and months.
I’m of the mindset that we in the entertainment industry have a really advantageous power to impact people in a very positive way. … I think it’s up to us to be able to flip the switch and show positive, inspiring, motivational types of stories. Stories where we see people doing good things, when we see people who are facing all of the challenges, but are trying to do the right thing in life.
I think once we see that, we’re going to see society coming together. I think we’re going to find our common ground. … Because at the end of the day, we as human beings, no matter where you’re from, how you look, what religion you follow, what sexual orientation [you are], we’re all humans. We all laugh, we all cry. We’re all afraid one day, and we’re all happy another. I feel like we have to find that common ground again, to come together so that one day we’re gonna sit at a table and it’s gonna be people from everywhere in the world, and we’re all loving each other.
THC: Much of your work is also focused on specific people tackling big global issues. Why do you think you’re so drawn to individuals?
CR: I think it’s being able to show that one character who was facing the challenges and hardships is learning from it. I think it’s that individual person who takes that journey. …It’s sad because I think we all as human beings have something within ourselves that either is haunting us or that we’re trying to overcome. We’re being challenged over and over again from year to year that we have to learn our life lessons. I think that’s why I gravitate to that individual journey and individual life experience.
THC: You’ve also said you’re going to be the first production company to make a film in space?
CR: It’s a huge challenge because I know Tom Cruise has said that. He’s probably working on it right now. There’s also a Russian company doing that too who want to probably outpace him. I always set my mindset to dream big. And I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but I definitely want to make sure that I can either be a challenge or a collaborator.
THC: What’s the next thing you’ll be working on at MirrorWater?
CR: “InGenius” is a project that we’re working really hard on right now and that we hope to be able to start filming soon. It is basically about the problems of the 21st century that the whole world is facing right now, and about solutions that are more ancient, maybe culture-specific, and more of the unusual thinking-outside-the-box type of solution [that are often overlooked in Western countries]. … That’s what we’ll be exploring, and we feel it’s really timely. We’ll be able to show something to the world that they don’t realize, and hopefully inspire people in the West, in Europe and North America, to think outside the box.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Australians own more guns today than they did in 1996. That year, the country’s largest mass shooting — the Port Arthur Massacre — led the government to swiftly adopt landmark gun control legislation, recalling and destroying 650,000 guns from residents.
That rise in Australian gun ownership is the catalyst behind director Justin Kurzel’s latest film, “Nitram.” The film, which premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, was greeted with controversy when Kurzel first announced it would follow the Port Arthur Massacre. At times excruciating, at others gripping, the drama follows the titular serial killer as he grows up in a suburb of Tasmania with his soon-to-be-suicidal father and an overbearing, cold mother who has trouble accepting Nitram as her own son. Through years of his parents and peers bullying him for his mental illness, audiences watch as Nitram becomes further and further alienated by society. And because the audience knows exactly where this story is going to end, every time Nitram is inconvenienced or in a position where he could easily take power, Kurzel gives us a chilling pause — a space for our expectations and anxieties to take over.
To maintain that anxiety throughout the film, Kurzel goes to great lengths to show how unchecked and volatile the eventual killer is. Pretty quickly, for example, audiences learn to recognize (and fear the consequences of) a distinct style of heavy breathing that Nitram adopts when he’s enraged beyond control. “Nitram” also puts heavy focus on how people in positions of power — his parents, psychologist and an adult friend named Helen — failed to keep him under control, or notice when he was struggling. Kurzel seems to cite these failures as a major factor for the massacre, just as he cites the gun shop employee, who, in an especially frustrating moment, enables Nitram’s growing gun obsession beyond the scope of the law.
At the same time, “Nitram” doesn’t necessarily humanize nor excuse its subject. Kurzel doesn’t seem interested in making the explicit argument that Nitram’s actions were only the result of being failed by the “system” or by those close to him. Rather, the film takes care in showing the few nurturing moments in Nitram's life — either in rare, genuinely loving relationships, or the tender moments in his more strained relationships — pathways to a possible redemption that unfortunately never materialized.
It's a challenging role, and there's no doubt that American actor Landry Jones’s performance is a high point for the film. The role, for which Jones was awarded “Best Actor” at the festival, sees him take on the serial killer’s insecurities and motivations in terrifyingly compelling ways.
Still, the mere existence of "Nitram" raises a series of essential questions: Whom is this film for? Who benefits from, or would be so interested in seeing, such a deep dive into the life of a serial killer — especially one at the heart of such nationwide and generational trauma?
Kurzel claims that he created the film to raise awareness about the realities of gun violence as Australia continues to loosen restrictions, but it's questionable if "Nitram" is the best way to achieve this goal. Sure, audiences are exposed to the dangerous shortfalls of having gun shops regulate who has access to deadly weapons, and we see the role that various broken societal systems played in allowing Nitram to fall into such violent actions. However, the film stops short of a long-standing message that links its existence to a clear call for gun control in Australia.
The film seems inconsistent with it's messaging — on the one hand, it plays up the lack of a strong mental health care system to support Nitram. But on the other, it seems to correlate Nitram's mental health and reliance on antidepressants (rather than his lack of access to adequate mental health care) directly with his violent actions. For a film that's meant to be a call to action for gun reform, not only is Kurzel's argument problematic in places like mental health, but inconsistent and consequently, ineffective in bringing about larger change.
“Nitram” is undoubtedly a strong technical film, especially with Jones's lead performance. However, its convoluted relationship with mental health, and its self-confused goals of sharing the Port Arthur Massacre story still leaves it with plenty of room to grow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the International Olympic Committee formally postponed the 2020 Olympic Games last March, Clark Dean ’23 had a couple of options: return to Harvard and attempt to balance remote classes and rowing, or take another gap year to train.
Dean ultimately picked the former.
“At some point, I'm going to have to get done with school, so I might as well just bite the bullet and do a year online,” Dean said of his rationale. “Because let's say I did take another gap year, and it's like okay, well we're still not back in person or the Olympics still didn't happen.”
At the National Team Training Center in Oakland, Calif., where he has spent the bulk of the past year and a half, he was the only American rower still taking classes while training. This made for a hectic schedule throughout the pandemic, but it has finally paid off: later this week, he is headed to Tokyo to represent the US.
Dean will be competing in the men’s four alongside Harvard alum Andrew Reed ’14, as well as Michael Grady and Anders Weiss. They have all known each other for over two years but had not begun rowing in a four together until a month and a half ago; this process is fairly different than that of other competing nations, whose boat configurations begin training together about a year before the Olympics.
The American men’s four most recently won a bronze medal in 2012 and has not won gold since 1960.
“[Since 2000], the British have won every year. They have a bit of a dynasty,” Dean said. Nonetheless, the Harvard junior has hope for both the men’s four and men’s eight going into Tokyo. “This year both boats are pretty quick — It didn't seem like we had to sacrifice any speed in one boat to make the other fast… So I think both boats have a pretty good shot.”
Dean is the only enrolled Crimson rower headed to the Olympics, but not the only Harvard affiliate; alumni Andrew Reed, Alexander Richards ’18, Conor Harrity ’18, Liam Corrigan ’19, and Olivia Coffey ’11 from the Radcliffe team are competing for America. Sam Hardy ’18 and Josh Hicks ’13 are competing for Australia, and Jüri-Mikk Udam ’17 is rowing for Estonia.
Liam Corrigan ’19 will be competing not only in his first Olympics but also in his first senior-level competition as well. He will participate in the men’s eight alongside Conor Harrity and Alexander Richards.
“It’s a bit unusual to have them both at the same time, but I'm really excited for it,” Corrigan said. “That’s also because the pandemic kind of delayed everything a year.”
While the Olympic postponement was generally a setback, it presented a silver lining for Corrigan, who was younger and less experienced than his peers in Oakland.
“I was still young, so I had a lot of room to improve just by having another 12 months of experience,” Corrigan said. “I felt like it was kind of an opportunity for me.”
Olivia Coffey is the only female Harvard alum rowing in the Olympics, and the former Radcliffe standout is no stranger to high-level competition. Coffey won the World Rowing Championships in 2013, 2015, and 2018, and she won bronze in 2014 and 2019. She was a spare in Rio in 2016, and now she is competing in the women’s eight in Tokyo.
Coffey graduated from Harvard a decade ago, but she says that her age has not been a limiting factor in her training. She trains for over six hours per day nearly every day.
“It's one of those sports where you need a really big cardio base, and the only way to get that is after years and years of training,” Coffey said. “So I'm actually faster now than I've ever been just by virtue of having trained for so long.”
Coffey is participating in the women’s eight, which historically has an excellent track record at the Games and beyond; the boat won gold in the past three Olympics as well as 10 consecutive World Rowing Championships until 2016.
After nearly two decades of vigorous training, Coffey is leaning towards making Tokyo her last hurrah.
“You don't know until you finish your race, but at this point, I don't plan on coming back to training,” Coffey said. “But I'll never say never.”
