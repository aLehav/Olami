After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: January 22, 2014, at 8:48 p.m.
Rakesh Khurana, Co-Master of Cabot House and a member of the Academic Integrity Committee, will serve as the next dean of Harvard College, effective July 1, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email to the FAS community early Wednesday afternoon.
Khurana, 46, will succeed current Interim Dean Donald H. Pfister, who took the helm of the College after Evelynn M. Hammonds, who served as dean from 2008 to 2013, stepped down from the post in July.
Khurana and his wife, Stephanie R. Khurana, will continue to serve as co-masters in Cabot after he takes on the deanship, Smith wrote in the announcement email.
“Rakesh’s style of leadership is distinctly inclusive; he understands the importance of listening and looks forward to engaging with the faculty and the College,” Smith wrote.
Khurana has served as Cabot co-master since 2010 and additionally serves as a professor at Harvard Business School and a professor of sociology within FAS. In his time as a College administrator, Khurana has sat on multiple committees related to College policy, including the Academic Integrity Committee—which proposed Harvard’s first-ever honor code last April—and the College’s alcohol policy committee, which he co-chaired. He also served on the University’s electronic communication policy task force, which was commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust last May and is expected to submit its recommendations to her by the end of January.
In a phone interview Wednesday, Khurana said that he is “really looking forward to working with the faculty and the staff and the students, hear[ing] their ideas, spend[ing] time with them to understand where they see opportunities for the College.” He added that he hopes to benefit from what Pfister learned in his time as interim dean. Khurana spoke from Davos, Switzerland, where he was moderating a panel at the World Economic Forum.
Although Khurana did not attend the College himself, he said Wednesday that “one of the benefits of being a House master is that you get some window into student experiences.”
"The hope is that…being House masters will allow us to have a strong sense of student needs and commit that easily with the long-term policies that the College is operating under,” Khurana said, later adding that "it was really important for us to remain House masters.”
Khurana said he will no longer have teaching responsibilities at HBS, however, once he fills the deanship.
Advisory committee member Howard M. Georgi ’68, a professor of physics and Leverett House Master, said that he was pleased that the new appointment is familiar with the intricacies of the House system.
“I think I speak for all the masters when I say that this is fantastic,” Georgi said. “We had lots of great candidates. But Rakesh is special. I thought [he was] the perfect candidate.” Georgi added that he was happy that the Khurana’s would remain in Cabot House.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who also served on the faculty advisory committee praised the choice.
“I think it’s a great appointment,” he wrote in an email. “There was really enthusiastic support for Rakesh across the board.”
Khurana will assume the deanship exactly a year after Hammonds vacated the post, which came several months after revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans after internal Administrative Board communications related to the cheating scandal investigation appeared in The Crimson. Hammonds then admitted at last April’s faculty meeting that she had authorized a second set of searches without the necessary permission, breaking faculty email privacy policy. Although some have suggested that the searches led to her departure, Hammonds has said that it was “not a motivating factor” in her decision to step down.
Khurana’s appointment also comes amidst a College-wide discussion about academic honesty roughly a year after the conclusion of Harvard’s largest cheating investigation in recent memory. As dean of the College, Khurana will chair the Ad Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, as debate about academic integrity and an honor code continue.
Khurana is one of several members of a subcommittee of the Academic Integrity Committee that convened this fall to begin the honor code’s drafting process, according to Terah E. Lyons ’14, another member of the drafting committee.
Following Pfister’s appointment as interim dean, Smith convened an advisory committee for the dean search comprised of 21 faculty members. Members of the committee held multiple open forums to solicit student feedback, though the discussions drew few students.
Pfister told College students in an email Wednesday that he would “be back in touch soon” about opportunities for students to meet his successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the lead authors of a series of working papers analyzing data from the first full academic year of edX courses said Tuesday night that the high dropout rate of course registrants on the platform is not an adequate metric to measure the program’s success.
That was after the papers, released earlier Tuesday, showed that 95 percent of registrants for courses offered by Harvard and MIT on edX, the open online education platform co-founded by the two universities, did not earn certificates of completion—a statistic that made headlines across the country.
In his discussion of the findings at Tuesday evening’s event at the Graduate School of Education, HarvardX Research Fellow Justin Reich maintained that these course certification rates on their own could not accurately portray the extent to which users are learning on the platform and that researchers are still looking for more informative metrics to evaluate online learning.
“A certification rate’s a funny thing,” Reich said. “The inferences that we are making based on these rates are probably not well supported. There are other ways that we could be thinking about course quality.”
In particular, Reich emphasized that classroom pedagogy does not provide a gold standard with which to evaluate online education because the two formats are different both in terms of their structure and expectations.
“The ways in which you interpret any of these data depends quite a bit on your frame of reference. I would encourage you, as you read through the reports, to play around with your frames of reference,” Reich said to a filled lecture hall of mostly graduate students and faculty members.
For instance, using the date of enrollment as a point of reference, the researchers found that the high drop rates fell substantially within a week or two after enrollment. After this initial window, the fraction of users who drop out decreases significantly, according to the reports, which analyzed data compiled from the 17 courses offered by Harvard and MIT during the 2012-2013 academic year.
Reich was one of several speakers at the event, entitled “The First Year of HarvardX: Research Findings to Inform the Future of Online Learning,” which was co-sponsored by HarvardX, the GSE, and the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. He was introduced by Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol, who oversees HarvardX.
Andrew D. Ho, an associate professor of education and co-chair of the HarvardX research committee, said in an interview before the event that the small percentage of registrants who earn certification actually translate to large real numbers, given edX’s large scale. With a total of 841,687 registrations, the 5 percent figure means that 43,196 registrants earned certificates.
In addition to enrollment and certification numbers, the large sets of data—averaging at 20 gigabytes per course—provided new insights into the current demographics of MOOC users, including age, gender, country, and previous education.
“[The reports] provide a nuanced description of the variation across open online courses and our hope is that they advance the discourse around these surprisingly rich and rapidly advancing learning ecosystems,” Ho said. “They show in great detail the demographic profiles of our registrants. Now that we know those, we can work to change those profiles through selective recruitment to meet our pedagogical goals.”
Ho attributed the comprehensiveness of the research to the ongoing collaboration between Harvard and MIT on the edX platform.
While giving summary of the researchers’ findings, the papers do not make public the raw data pertaining to the courses. Data sets and “interactive visualization tools” will be be released in the coming weeks, according to an edX press release.
Meanwhile, HarvardX will launch 14 new courses in the spring 2014 semester, with classes covering topics including economics, genomics, and history.
Toward the conclusion of his presentation, Reich mentioned that further educational experimentation would be incorporated into future edX courses as part of the organization’s continuing efforts to improve the accessibility and quality of education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harrison P. Bush Sr., who began driving shuttles for Harvard in 2007 and most recently serviced the Quad route from Monday through Friday, died Jan. 9.
Bush left his position in March 2013 to undergo cancer treatment at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, according to Carl A. Tempesta, associate director of transit, fleet, and charter operations.
Former colleagues and students remember him for his kindness and hospitality.
“If you’re a junior or a senior living in the Quad, you know Harrison Bush,” said David E. Harris Jr., director of transit and fleet services at Harvard. “He was a very kind and courteous driver, and he is going to be sorely missed by his coworkers and the students that rode on his bus.”
Patricia A. Bush, his wife of 37 years, said that he “loved” his job.
“He would come home with stories every day,” she said, adding that when he saw students running, “he would sit there and wait for them.”
She said that he was often touched by the kindness of Harvard students, such as Nadia J. Farjood ’13 and Jordan L.C. Ashwood ’13, who gave Bush a Dunkin’ Donuts gift card with a note thanking him for his kindness last spring.
“I still have that card,” she said.
Farjood said that she met Bush when he drove her and the 5th grade children she was teaching in the Summer Urban Program after her freshman year.
Even with a rambunctious group of fifth graders on the bus, Bush was “so calm and so kind and treated every kid with such respect,” Farjood said.
After she moved to the Quad, Farjood often rode Bush’s shuttle route.
“He made me feel really valued at the end of a hard day,” Farjood said. “He was kind of like a grandparent to me at Harvard.”
Similarly, Tempesta, who worked with him, said that he called Bush “the gentle giant.”
“He did whatever he could for students and was always flexible,” said Tempesta. “He was a great guy.”
A viewing and funeral service in honor of Bush was held Saturday at Concord Baptist Church. He is survived by his wife Patricia, four children, four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
An esteemed scholar of Chinese culture and music at Harvard for over 40 years and, with her husband, the College's first nonwhite House master, Rulan C. Pian ’44, died on November 30, 2013 in her Cambridge residence. She was 91.
Pian, who was a professor emeritus at the time of her death, began teaching at Harvard in 1947 as a Chinese language teaching assistant. She earned an undergraduate and master’s degree in Western music history from Radcliffe College, and, in 1960, a Ph.D. in East Asian languages and in music from Harvard. She became one of the first female professors to teach in the Music and the Eastern Asian Languages and Civilizations departments. 
Pian’s work in the blending of music, culture, and history earned her other accolades and also accorded her worldwide acclaim. 
In 1967, Pian published “Song Dynasty Musical Sources and Their Interpretation,” which became the standard reference on music from the Song dynasty. Her work gained her the Otto Kinkeldey Award, which honors a musicological book of exceptional merit.
"When she visited me in Korea, I noticed that her reputation among the musicians there was in high regard,” said University of Maryland musicology professor emeritus Robert C. Provine, one of Pian’s former Ph.D. students. “I took her to a National Institute of Music and they decided to hold a full concert in costume just for her." 
Among students, Pian was not only known for her academic achievements, but also for her hospitality, often opening her home to students if they needed a place to stay or needed muscial materials. 
"She was very kind and generous," University of Pittsburgh music professor emeritus Bell Yung, another of Pian’s former Harvard Ph.D. student said. “She often welcomed me into her home to see her personal library for books that the normal libraries would not have.”
From 1975 to 1978, Pian and her husband Theodore H. H. Pian served as co-masters of Radcliffe's South House, which is now known as Cabot House. Becoming the first ethnic minorities to have such a position at Harvard, Pian and her husband often treated the residents to home cooked meals.
 
"She embodies some of the values of Cabot House—diversity and inclusiveness,” said current Cabot Co-Master Stephanie R. Khurana. “The ability to be who you are and to be able to bring everyone together—she embodies it all. Not just for her ethnicity and gender but also for her academic pursuits."
 
In April 2008, a portrait of Pian was unveiled in Cabot House through the Harvard Foundation Portraiture Project. The project, sponsored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, aims to reflect the diversity of individuals who have served Harvard for at least 25 years with distinction.
 
“One of the my proudest moments was to present this portrait for her,“ said S. Allen Counter, a professor of neurology and director of the Harvard Foundation. Counter served as a resident tutor and a pre-med and science adviser while Pian was master of South House
 
“I recommended for her to be one of the first portraits. She was a very thoughtful and kind person,” Counter said.
 
The portrait of Pian hangs in the first-floor living room in Bertram Hall in Cabot House, commemorating her long service to Harvard.
 
Though she retired in 1992, Pian has had a lasting impact on those she met and taught, former colleagues said.
 
"She served as an inspiration on how I treated my own doctoral students. I usually tell them the things she told me when I was a student," Provine said.
 
"I will miss our conversations not only as teacher and student but also as friends," Yung said.
A memorial gathering honoring Pian’s life will be held on March 30 at 4 p.m. in the Cabot House Living Room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Nearly 35 years after it went missing, an 18th-century Qing Dynasty jade vessel will once again be on exhibit at the Fogg Museum after popping up at a Hong Kong auction site. On Tuesday, Jan. 21, representatives from Harvard Art Museums held a ceremony welcoming back the missing artifact, which is now worth an estimated $1.5 million.
 
The censer, an approximately half-foot tall jade vessel for burning incense, was donated by Ernest B. Dane, Class of 1892, and his wife Helen P. Dane to the Fogg Museum in 1942. Harvard first realized that it was missing Nov. 26, 1979.
 
Harvard Art Museums officials contacted law enforcement soon after the piece went missing and posted notices in several newsletters and databases dedicated to reporting stolen artworks, according to a statement released by U.S. Homeland Security Investigations and the Massachusetts District of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Monday.
 
In 2009, a branch of Sotheby’s auction house in Hong Kong realized that a censer it had received from a private seller was listed in the Art Loss Register, a lost art database. After determining that censer matched the descriptions in the database for the censer stolen from the Fogg Museum, Sotheby’s notified U.S. law enforcement.
 
On Sep. 25, 2013, the Department of Justice, after receiving input from Homeland Security Investigations and the United States Attorney’s Office, granted Harvard’s civil forfeiture complaint for the censer to be returned.
 
“The censer rejoins our permanent collections just before we open the doors to our newly renovated, state-of-the-art facility this fall, when it will be accessible once again to students, faculty, and scholars.” Director of Harvard Art Museums Thomas W. Lentz said in the press release.
 
“HSI will continue to investigate cases involving stolen art and cultural property from around the world and return the objects to their rightful owners,” Bruce Foucart,the Homeland Security agent in charge of the case, said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the rest of the College off for break, the Back Page is keeping up with the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-2) as it finishes the remainder of its nonconference schedule. With Harvard starting Ivy League play with a 61-45 win Jan. 11 against Dartmouth, staff writer David Freed takes a look at the Crimson’s final nonconference opponent—the Florida Atlantic Owls (6-11).
In its final nonconference matchup of the year, the Crimson hope to put the finishing touches on a solid, if not spectacular, first half to the season. Harvard has beaten every opponent it should so far this season, but was unable to raise its game in its two contests against top 25 teams, falling to Colorado and Connecticut on the road.
Coach
Owl head coach Mike Jarvis is trying to make history with this year’s Owl squad. Jarvis, who has already led three programs to the NCAA tournament—Boston University, George Washington, and St. John’s—is looking to become only the second coach in history to win 100 games at four different schools.
Jarvis’ forty-five year coaching career has taken him across the country, including a stop in Cambridge. Starting in 1973, he served as an assistant coach for the Crimson for five years before taking his first head coaching position in 1978 at his high school alma matter. From there, Jarvis moved on quickly to the collegiate ranks and has won over 400 games as a coach—making the Elite Eight once and the NCAA tournament eight times.
Roster
Senior guard Pablo Bertone has burst onto the scene for the Owls this year. After serving mostly as a spot-up shooter for the team in years past, Bertone has taken on the leading role for Mike Jarvis—averaging 18.2 points per game, nearly double his average from last year. However, this rise in volume has coincided with a drop in efficiency. After shooting 35 percent or better from three in his first three years, Bertone has dropped to 29 percent while shooting more than twice as many triples (more than five a game).
Behind Bertone, fellow international and junior forward Justin Raffington provides the main inside presence for Florida Atlantic. Raffington nearly averages a double-double (9.2 ppg, 9.0 rpg) and is the only player on the team to make at least half of his shots. Raffington, like Bertone, is turnover-prone, however. The pair averaged a combined 4.7 turnovers a game while the Owls average 13 turnovers (against just four steals) a game.
Early Season Play
 After opening the season with a 35-point win over Ave Maria, the Owls’ stumbled in the team’s next contests. FAU lost its next six games, including three decisions by at least 20 points. Against its most noteworthy nonconference opponent, the Owls fell by 33 to Jabari Parker’s Duke Blue Devils.
The Owls rebounded to win its next two home matchups, but its streaky play continued with four more losses. It has won three of four following the losing streak, and picked up its first road win of the season with a 73-68 win against the Rice Owls on Jan. 11. Exactly one week after the Crimson went into Houston and came away victorious, the Owls made eight threes and forced 16 turnovers to beat Rice.
 
Series History
The first-ever matchup between the two schools occurred in 2011 as Harvard defeated the Owls, 61-53, behind 12 points and 11 rebounds from then-senior Keith Wright ‘12. Harvard shot 55 percent from the field overall and outrebounded the Owls by 14 in the winning effort. The teams did not play each other in 2012, making this the first visit that the Crimson will take to Florida to play the Owls.
 
Overall Matchup 
While Harvard’s offense has suffered without leading scorer junior Wesley Saunders, out the last two games with injury, the defense has stayed strong. The Crimson held Dartmouth to 45 points and a potent Connecticut attack to just forty percent shooting from the field. Harvard will once again need seniors Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey to step up if Saunders cannot play. If they can shut down Bertone and Raffington, the team will be able to muster enough offense to take out the Owls, whose 5-2 home record comes without a win of any consequence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final non-conference game of the season, the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-3, 1-0 Ivy) was undone by a shooting effort as cold as the weather it left behind in Cambridge, falling in an upset at Florida Atlantic (7-12, 2-2 C-USA), 68-53, on Tuesday.
What appeared on the schedule to be a comfortable road trip before conference play began in earnest quickly became something different as Harvard shot brick after brick.
After the game, the stat sheet displayed numbers that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has never had to contemplate during his time in Cambridge. The Crimson shot 23 percent from the field and recorded just three assists, both record lows during Amaker’s tenure.
“It's one of those games where you're dumbfounded, a little befuddled,” Amaker said. “We haven't been like that this year. We normally have had stretches where we haven't played as well, but we've found ways out of it.”
Harvard entered the game ten days removed from the last time it took the court, a solid 61-45 victory over an improved Dartmouth squad. Whether or not the layoff was a factor, the Crimson seemed sluggish during an ugly first frame that saw the squad fall behind by as many as 15 points. The Owls played solid interior defense, challenging Harvard’s looks at the basket and recording seven blocks, but the Crimson was not having much luck on open shots, either. The visiting squad made only five of its 30 field goal attempts in the first half—16.7 percent—and trailed by nine at the break.
The Owls could have extended their lead even further in the first period had they taken better care of the ball; their seven turnovers allowed Harvard to keep the deficit manageable while the squad could not put the ball in the hoop.
In the second half, the Owls maintained their advantage through the hot shooting of freshman guard Marquan Botley, who hit his first six three-point attempts of the game, three of which came after halftime. His three-pointer with 13:52 to play in the second period gave FAU its biggest lead of the game, 45-28. Botley finished with a game-high 23 points.
The Crimson looked as if it might have finally shaken off the rust with a 9-0 run midway through the second half that cut the FAU lead to five with 5:36 remaining. But a crosscourt inbounds pass by D’Andre Johnson found Owls guard Jackson Trapp alone in the opposite corner for a crucial three-pointer to put FAU up eight. Harvard would get no closer the rest of the way.
“I thought [FAU] earned and deserved everything,” Amaker said. “They led from tap to buzzer. You give them a lot of credit, and for us, it was a very poor performance—the worst that we've had this season.”
In his first game back after missing the previous two to injury, junior guard Wesley Saunders—the team’s leading scorer—converted only three of his 14 attempts from the field, finishing with 11 points. His teammates in the backcourt, co-captain Brandyn Curry and sophomore Siyani Chambers, shot a combined two-for-15 and missed all eight of their three-point attempts.
The Crimson’s frontcourt did not fare much better. Freshman Zena Edosomwan was the only one of the group to make a field goal in the first half. The rookie submitted probably his best game in a Harvard uniform, turning in 11 points and a career-high nine rebounds, five of which came on the offensive glass. Outside of Edosomwan, the Crimson forwards collectively made two of their 19 shots.
Though it was not apparent on the scoreboard, there was at least some evidence on the court of why Harvard was a 10-point favorite heading into the game. The Crimson grabbed 21 offensive rebounds to FAU’s nine and got to the charity stripe 14 more times than the Owls.
But ultimately, Harvard’s failure to score from inside or outside doomed it to one of its most disappointing defeats in recent memory. The loss likely eliminates any hope the Crimson might have had for an NCAA tournament at-large bid, meaning that if the team is to return for another March run, it will have to do so by earning the automatic bid given to the Ivy League champion.
“It’s the first time I can recall where we really were just searching for long stretches,” Amaker said. “It’s a little disappointing. It’s hard to explain sometimes how that happens or why it happens, but [when] you've been in [college basketball] as long as I have been in it, you know it does happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While a blizzard hit Boston on Tuesday night, the coldest Cambridge residents were 1,451 miles south of the incoming snowstorm. In a surprise 68-53 loss to Florida Atlantic (7-12, 2-2 C-USA), the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-3, 1-0 Ivy) put forth its coldest shooting performance of the season, hitting at only a 23 percent clip from the field.
After the contest, head coach Tommy Amaker said he was “dumbfounded” about how his team performed, missing 10 of its 12 three point attempts in a shooting effort that plagued nearly every Crimson player.
Sophomore guard Siyani Chambers, a 40 percent three point shooter, missed all four of his threes and seven of his eight shots. Juniors Steve Moundou-Missi and Wesley Saunders, both better than 48 percent from the field coming in, missed 20 of their 25 attempts on the night. Senior Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry had an even tougher time, making a combined one of 10 shots.
SEASON-LONG STRUGGLES
The team’s shooting woes against the Owls were partially the product of poor ball movement. Harvard’s three assists were the lowest of the Amaker era and less than the season average of three separate Crimson players. The result was the worst shooting performance of the Amaker era, as well.
However, the poor field goal percentage was characteristic of the team’s struggles shooting the ball in 2013-14, where up and down the lineup players have labored to recapture their form of seasons past.
Overall, the squad is shooting 45 percent from the field and 35 percent from three—marks good enough, per Ken Pomeroy, for the 91st best offense in the country and the team’s worst shooting stats since 2007-2008. The top seven scorers for the Crimson are all shooting less than 50 percent from the field, each below his career average.
Co-captain Laurent Rivard, the only Harvard player to make a three in last night’s contest, shot 39 percent or better from behind the arc his first three years in Cambridge. This season, he is at 36 percent. Chambers has been a worse shooter across the board—making just 38 percent of his field goals overall and 71 percent from the line after shooting 43 and 81 percent, respectively, last year. Casey, a 51 percent career shooter coming into the year, is at 42 percent. Four different players shot 37 percent or better from deep in 2012-2013—just Chambers has accomplished that feat this season.
Amaker said that the team, which—shooting woes aside—has won 14 games behind a suffocating defense (35th nationally), will have to turn it around quickly before resuming conference play Sunday at Dartmouth.
“We still have a good club,” Amaker said. “We have a lot of games left, all conference games. We have been the target in our league in terms of the bulls-eye on our chest …. You can drop a game [like this that] you thought you could have played better in and then that triggers poor play as you move forward. That’s what you fight against as we move to league play this weekend.”
REFROSHING PLAY
The team’s silver lining for the night was freshman forward Zena Edosomwan. The former top-100 ESPN recruit came into the night struggling early in his career with the adjustment to collegiate play. Averaging only six minutes a game, Edosomwan has been buried in a deep Crimson frontcourt rotation—Casey, Saunders, junior Jonah Travis, and sophomore Evan Cummins—for most of the year.
The rookie’s uneven play is not for a lack of effort or attempts; the Harvard-Westlake alum takes a shot nearly every two minutes he is on the floor—almost twice as often as high-usage options like Chambers (35 minutes per game, nine shots per game) and Moundou-Missi (24 mpg, 6.6 spg).
On Tuesday, Edosomwan took his normal allotment of shots—10 in just 23 minutes—but, most importantly, was aggressive on the offensive glass. Edosomwan pulled down nine rebounds, including five on the team’s 21 on the offensive end, taking advantage of his teammates’ struggles from the field to generate quality shots in the paint.
“I was very pleased with his effort,” Amaker said. “He was the long bright spot for our team. He played hard and gave a workmanlike effort, unlike some of our other guys .... I was pleased to see that because maybe we can build more off that.”
