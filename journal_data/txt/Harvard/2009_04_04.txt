In celebration of International Pillow Fight Day, Boston decided to go all out for a city-wide pillow fight in Christopher  Columbus Park in the North End this afternoon. Hundreds of children, students, adults, and even a few intrepid senior citizens braved the windy weather for this all-out feathery showdown.
More pictures and feather-filled excitement after the jump.
Nothing says bonding like slapping the rando next to you with your 300 thread count goose down pillow, right? Whilemost participants opted for a traditional fluffy, friendly pillow, others got more creative, bringing discus-shaped throw pillows in an array of colors. Though they seem to be more versatile, they offer less by way of skull-crushing delivery.
Amid the excited screaming and friendly pillow pummeling, some got a little…well, um, violent. One man took it upon himself to run around swinging two pillows in hand, numchuck style, yelling, “DIE, MOTHERF***ER, DIE!!!” Whoa, calm down there, buddy. That’s a seven-year-old standing next to you.
And, of course, a pillow fight with strangers would be nothing without even stranger outfits. People showed up in everything from matching Sharpie-d out t-shirts to giraffe headdresses, shamu hats to wrestling masks. Costume winners for the day? These onesie wonders:
Dinosaurs? On fleece? On a grown man?! Excellent.
But then we noticed this gem:
Even better.
