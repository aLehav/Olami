After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In The Crimson's article on my criticism of Professor Cornel R. West ’74 promoting a contention that Harvard declined to consider him for tenure because of his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Professor West is quoted as saying, "If [Steinberg] wants to have a public discussion about Israeli politics, Israeli occupation, let’s have it — respectful."
At Harvard Hillel, where I am executive director, students and staff do not shy away from difficult conversations about Israel — quite the opposite. Recent Harvard Hillel programs in Israel have included time with the non-Jewish community in East Jerusalem, have traveled to the headquarters of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to hear directly from Palestinian leadership, and have included visits with Arab members of Israeli government and society. Even during this pandemic time, our online "Visions for Peace" program on Israel and its geopolitics this past winter break was facilitated by both an Israeli and a Palestinian tour guide. We consider it vital for students to encounter Israel's wonders and its challenges. Respectfully, we can and do engage with expert and knowledgeable partners in such discussion.
The discussion I would like to have with Professor West has to do with where he chooses to cast suspicion and place blame for his own situation. To be clear, my issue with Professor West at this moment is not his personal view on the Israeli-Palestinian situation, although some have used his allegation as an occasion to make a popular student petition on his behalf a vehicle for broadly demonizing rhetoric about Israel.
Missing from The Crimson’s coverage of the issue was a direct question to Professor West as to whether he had any evidence for his claim that Israel was at the root of his circumstances here at Harvard. Professor West called his speculation that the University declined to consider him for tenure for that reason "a plausible hypothesis," dismissing all other possible reasons, including the non-tenure-eligible position he accepted in returning to Harvard five years ago.
From blood libels to the fictitious “Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion,” Jewish communities throughout the ages have borne the brunt of prejudices promoted as being plausible hypotheses.
As I said in my communication to the Harvard Hillel community regarding Professor West's allegations and the student petition on his behalf, it would have been possible to make a robust case for Professor West without scapegoating Israel and those who care about her. Professor West, however, has seemed bent on substituting an argument about Israel for any discussion about his own choices. Activism is best and most capable of uniting us all when it is specific. It becomes sloppy and divisive when one issue becomes an omnibus for every other grievance and contention. Had Professor West and students urging his case only argued that his not having tenure was out of keeping with his distinguished career in the academy and discouraging to many in our Harvard community, I would not have disagreed.
Last week, I reached out to Professor West by email, asking him if we might visit together individually, as I’d hoped to discuss the effects on students of his centering Israel in his accusations about Harvard's leadership. I suggested a pandemic-safe visit with one another in the garden of a local Cambridge restaurant. Professor West seems to have an easier time responding to the newspapers than to me. Days later, he was quoted in the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz as saying, “I told the rabbi, ‘It’s clear you don’t understand me. Let’s have a jam session. You bring your ax, I’ll bring my ax, and we’ll have a serious exchange. It’s going to be intense, we’re talking about life-and-death issues here. But we can still understand each other, and we can have drinks together and talk about our disagreements.'"
Professor West does not seem as willing to engage in conversation with me as he claims — trivial in this context, but indicative of how he undermines himself and invents parts of this story. Professor West is entitled to his own views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even as I may disagree with the incendiary ways in which he has practiced his politics in that regard on our campus. Professor West misappropriates the indignities of Palestinians and their mantle by suggesting himself as a martyr to their cause in his own alleged victimization by Harvard. He further weaponizes a dangerous conflict by using it for his own purpose. He confuses and divides students in suggesting that anyone who obstructs him must be insensible or opposed to the national aspirations and human rights of the Palestinian people.
The Israeli and Palestinian peoples have difficult work to do. Courageous people have attempted that work several times through the past decades in heroic ways, and many are still working at it, without having yet solved an ages-old conflict. Nobody in that situation is helped at all by Professor West's unfounded and prejudiced accusations and untruths about people here at Harvard. Professor West leaves in the wake of his departure from Harvard divisions and suspicions of his making, which we who remain in this precious place now must work to heal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, instead of receiving live and spirited knocks on their doors, members of Harvard’s freshman class clicked into Zoom rooms to discover where they would be living for the next three years. Inevitably, this marked the second year of an unceremoniously remote and distanced approach to Harvard’s Housing Day; a second class of freshmen unable to wholeheartedly immerse themselves in what is usually one of the most memorable and festive days of the Harvard College experience.
Admittedly and regrettably, the most cherished happenings of the typical Housing Day experience have, on many levels, become bygone within the virtual world. Housing Day has long existed as a frenzied and buzzing live affair — gushing with in-person “dorm-storming” activities and socials that over eagerly welcomed freshmen into each house. To that end, entering a Zoom room is, even for the most optimistic of students, an anticlimactic contrast.
This sense of loss was widely felt, with students across backgrounds and classes left isolated on this year’s iteration of Housing Day. Parades of freshmen were left with faraway feelings, unenthused by the prospect of entering a webinar alone. Some students were stuck in their digital classrooms, unable — amidst the tangled scheduling difficulties of the online world — to attend their House reveals at all. And crowds filled with even the most spirited upperclassmen were prone to leaving the digital festivities on a markedly more somber note than that with which they had entered — feeling the absence of their friends and peers on leave, who were estranged from the day’s events.
And yet, it would be misguided to overlook that this year’s virtual Housing Day, in its own distinctive way, carried its own beauty.
For many freshmen, officially joining a House was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise abnormal and isolated year, marked by unmatched levels of distance from the Harvard world. Freshmen were able to partake in longstanding Harvard traditions — choruses of relieved freshmen, like those who came before them, celebrated their assignments into much-desired River Houses; others mourned their new status as residents of the not-actually-that-far Radcliffe Quadrangle. Most importantly, across differences in location, circumstance, and momentary grief or relief, all freshmen were able to feel out, for the first time, their place within a time-tested Harvard ecosystem, embodying the celebrations and lamentations of those before them.
Beyond that, subtle but enthusiastic pockets of community glistened through. Some seasoned house members graced this year’s Zoom reveals with frenzied screams and zealous voices, eager to welcome freshmen into their new communities even from a distance. Others opened up their schedules to give impromptu virtual tours of the houses to curious and eager-eyed freshmen, creating remote opportunities for exploration, immersion, and care. And still, others crafted Housing Day videos that built energy and excitement about House life, leaving all students — not just freshmen — more excited for the eventual return to ordinary campus life; to look ahead, and to celebrate the years of campus-wide vibrance that still await so many of us.
Such feelings of joy, comfort, and community simply could not have been forged without the concerted contributions of students on House Committees, who worked tirelessly to ensure that freshmen could have cherishable experiences within the constraints and limitations of the moment. The virtual events planned by each committee — animated by cheers, music, and rich information about House life — captured some semblance of normalcy within our pandemic-tainted college lives. They offered a preview for freshmen — and a reminder for all — about the vibrancy of campus life. Though certainly still strained, the celebrations left us all feeling warmed, brightened by hope for a return to campus, for our newest crop of House-bound students, and for the endurance of the Harvard traditions that we hold dear to us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that Harvard has yet to decide whether it will offer on-campus housing for Harvard Summer School, though he said the College is planning for a “fully operational campus” in the fall.
As part of Harvard’s 2020-21 reopening plan, students who studied away from campus for the entire academic year would be eligible to “come to campus” to enroll in up to two courses at the Summer School free of charge “in recognition of the fact that many of our students will not have a residential campus experience this year.”
The arrangement also offered subsidized room and board for students on financial aid.
The Summer School announced in December it will hold all 2021 classes online in light of the pandemic. It “will not be hosting a residential program for high school students,” the Summer School website states.
Though Harvard previously told undergraduates they would be eligible to “come to campus” to take Summer School classes, Khurana said in the Friday interview that Harvard has yet to decide whether it will provide housing for College students taking the remote Summer School courses.
“We have yet to still communicate about summer 2021 housing,” he said. “Housing is going to be, in part, determined by public health conditions and guidelines, and we want to accommodate people as best as possible around that.”
“That is a dynamic situation, and we’re trying to work really hard to get people as much clarity on that as possible,” he added.
A frequently asked questions page on the Summer School’s website states current College students “may be eligible” for on-campus housing this summer.
The deadline for College students to apply for the Summer School tuition waiver is April 7, according to the Office of Career Services website. Students offered the waiver have until April 19 to accept.
Khurana said the College plans to communicate further information once it has “a fairly good sense about the kind of conditions” that would be safe for students in residence.
Though the College has not finalized summer housing, Khurana said its “goal is to have a fully operational campus” during the fall 2021 semester.
“We, of course, have to do that with humility — recognizing the uncertainty around Covid-19,” he said. “But our teams are working with a fully operational campus in mind right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Classes of 2020 and 2021, the dream of walking across the stage in a cap and gown during a Harvard graduation is not dead yet.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Thursday that Harvard intends for future in-person celebrations for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 to closely mirror traditional Commencement Exercises with just “as much pomp and circumstance.”
Bacow announced on Feb. 26 the University would postpone its Commencement Exercises and hold a virtual ceremony in May due to ongoing public health concerns. This marks the second consecutive year without an in-person celebration for graduates.
The school has assured the Class of 2021 that Harvard plans to hold an in-person event “one day” — the same promise made to Class of 2020 graduates.
Bacow said Thursday that the University has yet to decide on a date for postponed commencements, but he is considering spring 2022 as a potential goal.
“One possibility is that we will do it adjacent to commencement next spring — assuming that we have an in-person commencement next spring, which I expect we will and certainly hope that we will,” he said.
Bacow noted the decision depends on the evolution of public health limitations over the coming year.
“We are at this point waiting to see when it is feasible to bring people together from literally around the world to celebrate the achievements of the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021,” he said.
With the Class of 2021 facing an uncertain job market after graduation, Bacow said the University has not made any decisions on whether to offer graduates financial assistance in returning to campus for the future in-person events.
“We obviously would like as many graduates there as possible,” he said. “We would endeavor to do what we can to try and be helpful as much as possible, but at this point, I can’t answer that more precisely.”
Commencement — and the class reunions that are held in tandem — are typically a fundraising boon for the University. Bacow said that Harvard has found alumni to “continue to be generous and supportive” in reunion years, even in the virtual environment.
Reunion programming for class years ending in ’1 and ’6 will take place virtually this spring.
In 2020, Harvard collected more money in current-use donations than any other year in the school’s history, according to Bacow.
“Partly that was because I think our donors recognized that we had a need for resources which could help us immediately, as opposed to gifts which might come in a form in which the resources are only available to us over time,” he said. “We probably saw a shift of giving for endowment to giving for current use.”
The University’s Fiscal Year 2020 financial report cautioned, however, that the increase in current-use gifts was partially the result of “many” early collections on past donation pledges from the most recent capital campaign, which ended in 2018. The report, which was released in October, warned that Harvard “should anticipate less philanthropy in the coming year.”
“I think we’re doing pretty well this year,” Bacow said, pointing to a $150 million gift from Bloomberg Philanthropies that was announced earlier this month.
“It’s quite remarkable because we’ve not had meetings in person with any of our donors,” he said.
Harvard hauled in a record-breaking $9.6 billion in its most recent capital campaign under Bacow’s predecessor, Drew G. Faust. Bacow said Thursday that the school has no plans for another capital campaign in the near future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Los Angeles Mayor Eric M. Garcetti spoke about his city’s handling of Covid-19 and racial and socioeconomic inequality during a webinar held by the Harvard School of Public Health on Friday.
The series — titled “Voices in Leadership” — focuses on leadership education and seeks to provide insight on how to be an effective leader. The discussion with Garcetti was moderated by School of Public Health professor Howard K. Koh, the former U.S. assistant health secretary.
Garcetti, who is of Mexican, Jewish, and Italian heritage, opened by explaining how his family life and upbringing prepared him to become a public leader.
“To me, crossing borders is kind of the history of our family and also part of the metaphor of my life,” he said.
“My grandfather, who literally was carried over the border in Mexico when he lost his father as a baby during the Mexican Revolution, has resonance when I watch mothers carrying their own children today over the border and being separated from them,” he added.
Garcetti then discussed the United States’ handling of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. He noted that while the World Health Organization deemed the U.S. the best-prepared country in the world for a global pandemic, it “executed among the worst.”
Los Angeles was one of the first major cities in the country to put forth strict pandemic guidelines, such as shutting down movie theaters, restaurants, and other places of gathering. Garcetti said he worked with the California Governor Gavin C. Newsom to implement a full stay-at-home order on March 12, making California the first state to do so.
Los Angeles, along with the rest of the U.S., is now focused on vaccine distribution. Garcetti set up the “biggest vaccination site in the world” at Dodger Stadium, providing 20,000 vaccinations per day, he said. In an effort to ensure equity, Garcetti and his team established mobile vaccination sites that can enter people’s homes and target lower-income areas, some of which are “over 95 percent people of color.”
According to Garcetti, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony S. Fauci ranked Los Angeles as one of the best-performing cities in the country with regards to vaccine distribution.
Systemic racial and socioeconomic inequalities have long plagued the United States, and the pandemic has brought these injustices to the forefront of national attention, Garcetti said. To address these inequities, Garcetti said he believes that a universal basic income or a “real conversation about reparations” is needed in the country.
“It’s not just about making right what was wrong,” Garcetti said, “It’s about materially giving people the resources to have the same shot that you may have.”
In response to these racial inequalities, Garcetti pledged in June of last year to invest $250 million in communities of color, $150 million of which would come from the police budget. Garcetti argued that cities burden police with too many responsibilities that should not fall on their shoulders, such as assisting the homeless and responding to mental health crises. To redirect these responsibilities to more qualified professionals, Garcetti said some resources need to be shifted. For example, Los Angeles will soon roll out mental health care vans that will respond to 911 calls at any time of day, becoming the first major city in America to do so.
Asked what lessons can be learned from the crises of the past year, Garcetti said he hopes the country never disregards public health again, which he said was “systematically” defunded for the last couple of decades. Additionally, Garcetti said his greatest hope is that Americans work together and “find one another again.”
“We’ve locked into who we are supposed to be against rather than what we share,” Garcetti said regarding the pandemic. “A crisis that demanded we be separated from each other we found could only be solved by coming together.”
Garcetti ended by encouraging the School of Public Health students who were watching the webinar to drive change.
“Don’t wait to be told you’re a leader — you’re a leader today,” Garcetti said. “It is young people who have always led social change.”

Harvard University Health Services’s Center for Wellness and Health Promotion opened applications last week for undergraduates to join a merged peer education program that HUHS will launch in fall 2021 as part of an overhaul to the University’s peer education system.
The new program — dubbed Wellness Educators — will seek to offer a range of services previously provided by four groups: Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, Health Peer Advisors and Liaisons, and Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication.
Similar to those former groups, students who undergo training will lead Wellness Educators and receive supervision from HUHS staff.
In their roles as Wellness Educators, undergraduate members will help connect students to campus health resources and “educate their peers about holistic wellbeing,” the Center’s senior health educator, Amanda Ayers, wrote in an emailed statement.
“Wellbeing is a dynamic and fluid continuum influenced by many interconnected dimensions. All aspects of a person’s wellbeing — physical, emotional, social and spiritual, and more — are affected by one another,” Ayers wrote. “We wanted to create a student group that reflects these principles.”
HUHS plans to accept approximately 25 to 30 College students to serve as members, forming a group similar in size to the previous groups, according to Ayers.
HUHS announced the merger of the groups in September 2020. Though Harvard reached its decision to combine the groups without consulting students beforehand, HUHS said at the time it would solicit student input when putting together its programming.
It also stated it planned to continue operation of the individual peer education groups until the fall 2021 launch of the merged program.
That plan changed before the spring semester, though.
In December, the four groups posted on social media accounts announcing they would no longer be active and noting that “HUHS peer education is changing.”
Three of the groups responded to emails sent this month with automatic replies that they are not “able to fulfill programming requests at this time.”
Asked why HUHS discontinued the peer education groups before the merged program became operational, HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in an emailed statement Friday that HUHS redirected its efforts toward developing Wellness Educators after observing a decrease in demand for the peer education groups’ services during the fall semester.
The HUHS offices that supported the previous groups will continue to provide health education and resources for students until the program launches in fall 2021, according to Ayers.
For instance, the Center for Wellness and Health Promotion has partnered with College residential staff to distribute safe sex supplies on campus — a role previously fulfilled by Sexual Health Awareness and Relationship Communication. And instead of attending workshops hosted by individual peer education groups, freshmen completed a workshop on holistic wellbeing led by HUHS during virtual orientation in August.
Perry added that HUHS has created a committee that includes members from two of the defunct groups to advise the planning of Wellness Educators.
Some members of the former peer education groups have already joined Wellness Educators, per Ayers.
Robin M. Robinson ’22, who previously served as a member of DAPA, said she will probably not join the new group, however.
Robinson noted she is unsure if the program plans to sort members into subcommittees or if Wellness Educators will be responsible for combining the expertise of all the former peer education groups.
“I don’t know if I want to do this because then I would have to learn four times the amount of material,” Robinson said. “The DAPA comp was almost the whole semester, meeting three hours a week and learning all this new material.”
Robinson added that HUHS’s statement last fall announcing the restructuring of the peer education groups came as a “pretty big surprise.” She said she sees “more cons than pros” to a consolidated program and said the program will not carry name familiarity with students.
“DAPA was really well known and had really good branding: DAPA bottles, DAPA cups,” she said. “I’m curious about how the Wellness Educator group is going to brand themselves and get themselves out to the student body.”
Ayers said members of Wellness Educators will shape the group’s branding during its first semester.
Student Mental Health Liaisons was the only peer education group that did not merge into Wellness Educators. Instead, it rebranded in fall 2020 as a chapter of Active Minds, a national mental health organization for college students, though it still falls under HUHS.
Hannah R. Alton ’22, co-president of the Harvard Active Minds chapter, said she and another former member of Student Mental Health Liaisons formed the new Active Minds chapter to “fill the space that was left when SMHL disbanded.”
Though Alton said HUHS has not asked Active Minds’ members for feedback on shaping Wellness Educators, Alton said it has retained the connection with Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services that the group had previously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts State Rep. Michael L. Connolly, a Democrat who represents parts of Cambridge and Somerville, submitted two bills in the Massachusetts House last month aimed at reforming controlled substance laws.
The first bill, H.D. 3439, would decriminalize all controlled substances at the state level while the second, H.D. 3829, would form a task force to examine the legalization of entheogenic plants. This category of substances includes peyote, MDMA, and “magic mushrooms,” also known as psilocybin mushrooms, and has been the subject of research in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other conditions.
This is the latest development in a statewide movement toward broad decriminalization and legalization of controlled substances spearheaded by the Massachusetts Coalition for Decriminalization, a collective of several smaller regional advocacy groups. City councils in Cambridge and Somerville recently passed orders calling for the decriminalization of entheogens following votes of 8-1 and 10-0, respectively.
Filed by Connolly and fellow representative Elizabeth “Liz” Miranda, a Democrat who represents parts of Dorchester and Roxbury in Boston, the first bill would replace the current criminal penalties for the use and possession of controlled substances with a civil fine of up to $50 — which would be waived if an individual agrees to “needs screening” to address possible substance abuse issues or other health and wellbeing concerns such as lack of food or housing.
The second bill would create a task force of medical and economic justice experts to study the legalization of entheogenic plants and present findings to the state.
In an interview with The Crimson, Connolly said the successful passage of decriminalization bills in Cambridge and Somerville, as well as legalization efforts in other states such as Oregon, were significant factors in his decision to bring both bills before the House.
“Our communities have expressed through our city officials that they want to move forward in a very progressive fashion,” Connolly said. “Seeing some of the national and international thinking on this issue, combined with this local push to decriminalize these substances has convinced us that this is a conversation that we ought to be having at the State House.”
Connolly said Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, a member of the Massachusetts Coalition for Decriminalization, has been in touch with him throughout the process. The group also played a part in organizing support in both Cambridge and Somerville for their respective policy orders, he added.
James Davis, a member of Bay Staters for Natural Medicine, credited the Coalition’s wide network of volunteers with the successful movements in those cities.
“Our coalition, including Decriminalize Nature Massachusetts, wrote the resolutions and helped our community volunteers persistently and persuasively contact their representatives to share stories of how these plants have saved their lives from addiction, trauma, and depression,” Davis wrote in an email.
“We’re proud to be offering training in how to fight the whole drug war,” he added.
Both bills are now awaiting public hearings, pending referral to a House committee.
Connolly said public hearings are the “next big milestone,” after which the committee would have until early 2022 to either send it forward with a favorable recommendation or decline to advance it.
“Our immediate goal would be to have a very strong committee hearing and look to move the bill favorably through the committee process,” Connolly said. “Then it would be a matter of looking to build the consensus to get the bill to the floor.”
Brendan T. O’Connor, a member of Decriminalize Nature Massachusetts, said the long timetable for both bills is no reason for pessimism, and that his organization will continue its efforts in the interim.
“The key message that we’ve been adopting is that this doesn’t delay any of our other efforts,” O’Connor said. “We have an internal goal of decriminalizing 90 percent of the state before the end of the year, and that’s a big, audacious goal, and we’ll do that regardless of what the state wants to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faith A. Jackson ’16 and Irfan Mahmud ’16 will be the next Harvard Law School student body co-presidents, making the pair the first openly queer candidates and Mahmud the first Muslim candidate to be elected to the positions.
The two candidates ran on a platform that prioritized “fun and inclusivity.” Other campaign agendas included funding for section retreats and reunions, more faculty in diverse areas, free professional headshots, mental health support, and the expansion of financial aid initiatives.
Jackson and Mahmud are both second-year students at the Law School who share a long history of friendship, dating back to their time at the College, when they were blockmates.
Jackson, who hails from Prince George’s County in Maryland, a majority Black suburb of Washington, D.C., said she has consistently advocated for robust and accepting social spaces since entering the University as an undergraduate.
“I went to public schools all my life before going to Harvard College,” Jackson said. “I’m very much excited about the idea of inclusive and fun social space, and that’s been the crusade that Irfan and I have been fighting since undergrad.”
Mahmud, who is from St. George, Utah, and whose family comes from Bangladesh, said the campaign consisted of diverse Law School students of all ages, degrees, and personal backgrounds.
“We got people involved from all the different class years,” Mahmud said. “We got people involved who are [Master of Laws] and international students, [Doctor of Juridical Science candidates] and different degree types in the school as well, which was really exciting to see passion and energy come from all pockets of campus.”
Kirin Gupta ’16, a first-year student at the Law School who is also Mahmud’s fiancé, wrote in an email that Jackson and Mahmud’s co-presidency marks a historic moment for the Law School.
“It’s a huge moment for HLS to have their first Muslim president and a Black woman president, a team of two queer folks, at the helm,” Gupta wrote. “Especially in this year and moment, I don’t think that can be understated.”
Kit A. Metoyer ’16, a student at the Law School who helped with the campaign’s outreach and was roommates with Jackson and Mahmud while at the College, said that the duo’s platform of fun and inclusivity was especially relevant this year.
“In particular, this past year has been really difficult for all of us,” Metoyer said. “I know that they’re committed to bringing everybody back to campus with a bang in a safe way, maximizing the amount of fun, and harnessing and really appreciating the different backgrounds of the student body.”
To increase student participation amid the virtual school year, Mahmud said he and Jackson were intentional about outreach, emailing the leadership of every student organization on campus.
“We sent texts to hundreds of people just getting people’s ideas, encouraging them to get involved with the campaign, to support the ideas that are important for them in student government,” Mahmud said.
Fariba Mahmud ’22, Mahmud’s sister, said she and her brother were on the phone with Faith and her family when they heard the election results.
“I was very proud of my brother, just seeing how much work he and Faith put into this election, not only into the election itself but the amount of work that they put into HLS and in the communities that they’ve built,” Mahmud said.
“They just truly care, and I think the Law School is in really good hands,” she added.
Last year, the duo had run for co-presidency but lost the race.
Jennifer V. Jackson, Faith Jackson’s mother, said she had encouraged her daughter to run again despite the initial setback last March.
“She felt a little bit discouraged, but I said to her, ‘Look at all those people who voted for you! You just have to run again,’” Jennifer Jackson said. This year, Faith Jackson texted her mother the good news, which made Jennifer Jackson “very very happy for her.”
Ivanka D. Canzius, a second-year law student who served with Mahmud as a section representative and met Jackson in the Armed Forces Association, described the co-presidents as “motivated.”
“They may not always get their way, but they continue to try and so I feel like their hearts are in a good place,” Canzius said. “They don’t just say they want better things, they actually put the time into trying to do it.”
On top of fun and inclusive programming, Jackson said the co-president pair aims to include advocacy efforts and foster community among individuals from politically diverse backgrounds.
“It’d be helpful to have a more cohesive Law School community that makes some people feel more included than they do and then also ensures that they’re talking to others who may have diametrically different opinions but could find some common ground if we were actually having a strong group of community,” Jackson said.
Velo-Vincent P. van Houden, who worked with Mahmud as a student government representative and collaborated with Jackson on financial aid advocacy, said he hoped their co-presidency would “build a network” among students, some of whom have yet to have the on-campus experience.
“We only really get this experience once, and a big part of it is getting to know your classmates,” van Houden said. “Lots of initiatives to bring people together that way will be nice to have.”
Nicole L. Khamis, a student at the Law School who helped with the campaign, said she appreciated Jackson and Mahmud’s genuine interest in getting to know the student body.
“What it really came down to for me is the fact that they don’t just say they care, they show that they care,” Khamis said. “That’s what matters to students and that’s what matters to me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2021 at 2:45 p.m.
Harvard’s Reischauer Institute for Japanese Studies issued a statement last week calling on the publishing journal to “fully address” concerns raised around Harvard Law professor J. Mark Ramseyer’s contentious article on “comfort women,” and condemning online harassment that has stemmed from the controversy.
Since Ramseyer’s forthcoming article in the International Review of Law and Economics has attracted international media attention, many Harvard professors — including Ramseyer himself — have reported receiving harassing emails and social media messages.
Before and during World War II, the Japanese Empire took women and girls from its occupied territories as sex slaves, today known as “comfort women.” In his paper, Ramseyer — a professor of Japanese legal studies — disputes this historical consensus, claiming these women were gainfully employed by choice. In response to worldwide condemnation from scholars and protests internationally, the journal set to publish his paper has delayed its publication and put the article under re-examination.
In its statement updated March 15, the Reischauer Institute noted that Harvard Japanese studies faculty had raised “serious concerns” about the “empirical foundations” of Ramseyer’s article. The statement goes on to provide links to an academic refutation sent to the IRLE in February by Harvard professors Andrew Gordon ’74 and Carter J. Eckert, as well as a critical article in the New Yorker by Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen.
“The Reischauer Institute reaffirms its call to the journal editors to fully address the concerns raised by scholars in the U.S. and abroad,” the statement reads.
The statement concludes by urging that discussion around the article remain “informative and civil,” condemning any form of harassment or hate speech.
While University and Law School administrators have repeatedly declined to make a statement, the Reischauer is one of two official branches of the University to publicly comment on the controversy.
Reischauer Institute’s statement follows a Feb. 19 statement issued by Harvard’s Korea Institute which formally endorses Gordon and Eckert’s refutation for the journal and similarly condemns harassment and hate speech. The Korea Institute was the first arm of Harvard to make an official statement regarding Ramseyer’s article.
In a Feb. 5 interview with The Crimson, Ramseyer said he had begun receiving hate mail and death threats after the South Korean press started reporting on his article in early February.
Other Japanese studies faculty have also been subjected to harassing messages. On March 8, Ramseyer and Director of the Reischauer Institute Mary C. Brinton received several rounds of hate mail, at least one of which copied 35 other Harvard faculty members.
Following the March 8 messages, Brinton emailed Ramseyer, copying other faculty colleagues, to inform him that the “entire Japanese studies community at Harvard is now being targeted” by such messages.
“I am sure you understand how profoundly disturbing—and needless to say, distracting—this has become for us,” Brinton wrote to Ramseyer.
She added in the email that she and two other professors — Gordon and director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations Christina L. Davis ’93 — requested the University issue a public statement on the controversy or otherwise provide guidance on how the faculty could respond themselves.
Brinton, Gordon, and Davis declined to comment further on the request, as did University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
David L. Howell — chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations — wrote in an email that he and the entire EALC department had also been targeted by hate mail.
“I wasn’t the personal target of any of the hate, so I was able to shrug the messages off, irritating though they were to receive,” Howell wrote.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey was also targeted by hate mail, Howell added. Kelsey did not respond to a request for comment.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment, citing HUPD’s policy not to comment on open investigations.
Ramseyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment and Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal also declined to comment.
University of Connecticut professor of Japanese and Korean history Alexis Dudden, who has publicly criticized Ramseyer’s article, said she also received threatening and harassing emails.
Dudden said, however, that she could not comment on the specifics of the messages she received because of an ongoing Freedom of Information Act request for her emails about the comfort women issue.
“This is a pattern, and it is part of a broader, a longer, history of attempts at intimidation and threats,” she said regarding the FOIA request, though she noted she generally supports FOIA.
Northwestern University professor Amy B. Stanley ’99, who co-authored a critical analysis of Ramseyer’s article, wrote in an emailed statement that she received “oblique threats” and reported them to local authorities.
“Unless they escalate further, I don’t think they’re serious,” Stanley wrote. “Still, I’ve reported them to the police, because my university wants to have a record.”
The IRLE’s investigation of Ramseyer’s article is ongoing. It published an updated Expression of Concern statement on March 9 reaffirming that it is soliciting post-publication comments on Ramseyer’s article, but that the article is considered to be a “formal and final publication.” The online issue “is still in progress,” according to the Expression of Concern, allowing for the addition of further articles or editors’ comments to articles that make up the issue.
Eyal Winter, professor of economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said he was one scholar asked to take part in the post-publication review process.
“I’m not sure what they are going to do with my report,” Winter said. “But I hope they will eventually decide to retract the paper. It shouldn’t be there.”
At least one of IRLE’s associate editors has already resigned over the controversy. Northwestern law professor Alex Lee ’00 said though associate editors have no say in articles before online publication, he helped the journal solicit experts following the controversy to evaluate the historical claims laid out in Ramseyer’s article before resigning.
Lee said he has been told that two other Associate Editors have stepped down from the journal since Ramseyer’s article went live online.
CORRECTION: March 22, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Reischauer Institute was the first branch of the University to make an official statement regarding Ramseyer’s forthcoming article. In fact, Harvard’s Korea Institute was the first to issue a statement, on Feb. 19.

Since last March, Covid has been the only thing on people’s minds (...and Driver’s License, but we all knew that), but there is light at the end of the tunnel! With the vaccine rolling out across the country, we thought we’d give you all of the details to help you prepare for your dose.
The Vaccines, Explained
For all of those who are not concentrating in a life sciences field, here’s a brief rundown of the vaccine. More detailed information can be found from the CDC.
Vaccines introduce your body to a less harmful form of a virus in order for your immune system to recognize it and create protection in the form of a protein called antibodies. These antibodies are designed to target and attack specific viruses.
Pfizer and Moderna’s versions of the Covid vaccine are mRNA vaccines. These vaccines takes a tiny bit of genetic material from the virus called the messenger RNA, or mRNA, which contain instructions to create a bit of protein on the outside of the virus called the spike protein. Your body then takes this viral mRNA and uses it to create the spike protein.
Johnson & Johnson’s version of the vaccine is a vector vaccine. This type of vaccine inserts a harmless virus genetically modified to contain DNA from the coronavirus (otherwise known as a vector), and this vector uses the cells’ machinery to produce coronavirus spike proteins.
In both types of vaccines, the viral DNA does not get integrated into the vaccine recipient’s DNA! Once the spike proteins are made, the vaccinated person’s cells will display these coronavirus spike proteins on their surfaces. This spike protein is completely harmless and will not give you Covid. Your immune system will then create the protective antibodies to attack the spike protein, and by extension, attack the Covid virus. Thus, if you actually do get Covid, your immune system will recognize the spike protein on the virus and already has protections in place to destroy the virus.
Some of the many benefits of the vaccine include protecting you against Covid, reducing transmission, and potentially reducing the severity of disease. You can read more about the benefits of the vaccine on the CDC website!
The Writer Experience (Ellen)
I got the Moderna vaccine and logged all of my symptoms for both doses. Please note that everyone will react differently and this is not a set of instructions to follow after you get your shots!
First Dose
I got my first dose around 6 p.m. on a Thursday at Boston Children’s Hospital and was immediately seated in a lecture hall for observation for 15-20 minutes. My arm grew progressively weaker throughout the evening, but since I can barely lift a 15-pound weight without sweating, that’s not saying too much.
The exhaustion I felt next morning was akin to the fatigue you feel on the Saturday afternoon of a four-day Halloweekend. Tired, but could definitely rally if needed. I couldn’t say the same for my arm, which hung limply at my side as I slogged through my work day. By the evening, my symptoms completely disappeared and I even felt like I could handle a workout. Instead, I watched Netflix.
Second Dose
By the time my next appointment rolled around three weeks later, I was stoked to be fully vaccinated. I received the shot at 6 p.m. again and went to bed, antibodies and serotonin coursing through my veins, blissful and unaware of what was to come.
At 7 a.m. Friday morning, I felt like I had been hit by a truck. I was feverish and cold despite being bundled in three layers of blankets, and my joints and muscles ached to the point where sitting up was difficult. After struggling out of my bed (read: one hour later), I registered a distinct headache and nausea, and swiftly called out of work only to collapse back into my bed. Not uncommon for the second dose, I experienced a 102-degree fever throughout the day with symptoms continuing until, you guessed it, I went back to bed.
By Saturday morning, my energy levels were back to normal, I was feeling healthy, and have been great ever since. Even though I experienced symptoms the day after, I can attest that the vaccine was infinitely worth it, not only to protect me against the virus but slow the pandemic and protect our community at large.
The Writer Experience (Christine)
Like Ellen, I received the Moderna vaccine. I won’t lie, I was a bit surprised by my experience with both the first and second doses…
First Dose
I received my first dose in late February at Gillette Stadium, one of the largest general vaccination sites in the Boston area. My appointment was around 2:30 p.m. on a Sunday, and it was a fairly painless experience. I was ushered through the site in a very orderly fashion, had a lovely conversation with the nurse administering my shot, and was out of the stadium within an hour.
While I felt fine right afterwards, my arm got heavier as time went on. I actually wasn’t too concerned about it; this is the most common side effect given that the shot is administered into the muscle. By 7 p.m. I was feeling quite nauseous and shivery, which doesn’t seem to be very normal for the first dose, though experiences definitely vary widely.
The next day was somewhat near hell for me: I was incredibly tired, could not lift my arm even an inch or two from my side, and experienced intense cold sweats by mid-afternoon. After passing out to nap into the evening, however, most of the nausea was gone, though I was still pretty exhausted. I went to bed early — washing up was quite an ordeal with my dead weight of a limb — but woke up on Monday morning with nothing more than the sore arm, which finally went away by Tuesday afternoon.
Second Dose
After the unexpected nightmare that was my first dose, I was gearing up for another painful weekend of cold sweats and heavy limbs. Receiving my second shot once again around 2:30 p.m. four weeks later, I was pleasantly surprised by what happened next.
My arm felt, once again, slightly heavy and sore in the area where I received my shot. However, beyond this, I experienced no other pressing physical symptoms that warranted extra layers of blankets or cups of tea (I did let myself eat generous helpings of ice cream after dinner, though).
Even the next day, I was shocked to find I could raise my arm and perform basic tasks, like washing the dishes and brushing my hair, that were virtually impossible for me the first time. I was still rather exhausted, but after several naps throughout the day, was pretty much back to normal by the evening. I still allowed myself several servings of Cookies ‘n Cream and Korean reality TV shows as a congratulatory gift for finally receiving both doses.
All in all, I seemed to have a fairly difficult experience with my first shot, while my second shot entailed little more than a sore arm and slight fatigue. I experienced something of a symptom reversal between my first and second doses compared to most, but of course this is not necessarily unexpected; everyone has different experiences.
The Writer Experience (Georgia)
I received the Pfizer vaccine and have only had my first dose as of writing this article. Here’s how it went:
First Dose
Nearly eight weeks after I first became eligible for the vaccine in my state, I was finally able to book an appointment 90 minutes away from where I live. After weeks of playing whack-a-mole (vaccine) with pharmacy websites, my mom and I secured appointments at a hospital in a more rural and well-supplied part of our state for a Sunday night in mid-March.
We arrived early for our 8:05 p.m. appointment and were quickly welcomed and given our CDC dose cards, then ushered to the absolutely wonderful health care workers administering the vaccine. As I was taking a deep breath in so I could exhale (apparently that’s supposed to help make shots less painful?), the nurse jabbed me with the vaccine unexpectedly. She said that she felt my muscle do a weird little contortion because my muscle was surprised. It probably made the shot a little more painful that it otherwise would have been, but to be completely honest, I was so thrilled to get the vaccine that nothing could possibly faze me.
After that we walked into an auditorium to wait for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, then jumped in the car for the 90-minute drive home (with an ice cream stop on the way). I tried to move my arm around a bit while I rushed to finish my weekend homework, then went to bed feeling great.
The next morning, I woke up, reached for my phone, and my arm felt like a log. My entire upper arm was sore and I could barely reach above shoulder height for my first few waking hours. Over the course of the day, it got better, but remained super sore. When I got the vaccine I was told to use an ice pack or Tylenol for any pain, but I decided to rough it out because I was too lazy to find Tylenol.
Whether you are eagerly awaiting your turn for the Covid vaccine or have already received a dose or two, remember that a sore arm is well worth helping to protect the more at-risk individuals in our community. Check out this resource from the CDC to learn when and how you can sign up to receive the vaccine, along with that highly coveted “I’m vaccinated!” button. If you’re looking for more resources on eligibility, or need help booking an appointment for yourself or someone else, definitely check out Covid Vaccines Info Guide. The website, created by Catherine H. Yeo ’23-22 and Eric Z. Lin ’22, is probably the least confusing masterlist of Covid vaccination information that we’ve run across so far. You can also sign up for email alerts, so you’ll be the first to know when guidelines change in your state. Best of luck snagging a vaccine appointment! Believe us, those freebies were almost as good as getting the vaccine itself.
