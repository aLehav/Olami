“Do It Yourself,” Damián Ortega’s new exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Art, is so densely packed that at first its full scale can be difficult to grasp. Between the disassembled and suspended 1989 Volkswagen Beetle, the revolving tower of oil barrels, and the clump of leather ribbons hanging from the ceiling by meat hooks, every one of these larger than life installation pieces seems to be wrestling for attention.Although Damián Ortega now lives in Berlin, Germany, his roots in Mexico City remain a strong influence on his work. On a cultural basis, his work mirrors developing societies, often drawing from his birthplace. This interest is evident in “Do It Yourself,” which opened last Friday at the ICA and will run until January 18.Ortega’s background as a political cartoonist is pervasive in his art. The pieces he creates have a distinctively dark humor about them and are often a metaphor for society, especially society in Latin America. This is made manifest in the two collections of photographs that comprise the pieces “Resting Matter (Mexico)” and “Resting Matter (Brazil).” These photographs depict bricks stacked outside houses for possible future renovations or extensions, a common custom in these two countries. The bricks seem to be the concrete representation of a family’s hopes and dreams, and as a compilation of images they form the hopes and dreams of a country as well. Another piece, “Cosmic Thing,” created in 2002, is made up of a 1989 Volkswagen Beetle dismantled down to its individual parts and hung by metal wire from the ceiling. The pieces are organized to form a 3-D model of the car that looks as if it has leapt off the page of a mechanic’s instruction manual. Every detail is its own entity; the horn hangs in space separated by a few inches from the floating steering wheel, and even the wipers are similarly detached from the windscreen. Despite this distancing, the relationship to the complete subject is not lost, but is in fact amplified.Ortega chose the Volkswagen Beetle because it is the quintessential Mexican car. Produced natively, it is the vehicle of choice for taxis, as well as the artist, who once drove the same model himself. Taken apart, the Beetle is not diminished but transformed from a functional vehicle into a creative masterpiece that forces us to simultaneously observe the world around us on both a micro and macro scale. This desire to explore the relationship between objects and ourselves is reflected again in the piece “120 Days.” After reading an article by a market analyst that partially attributed the success of Coca-Cola to the way its original glass bottles mimicked the shape of a woman’s body, Ortega set out to explore the various forms a uniform glass bottle can take. Working from the initial idea of the bottle representing sexuality, Ortega plays with variations of embracing bottles, personifying the objects in the act of lovemaking. He branches out in his experimentation of form to create an array of bottles that have embellishments, multiple colors, modified shapes, or all three. Each bottle is striking in its own way and, placed together on a long white table, they mirror each other and come together as a metaphor for diversity in society.All these pieces make “Do It Yourself” a bit overwhelming at first; each piece has such a complexity to its composition, with the possibility of being interpreted on many different levels. The political and cultural inspiration for the work are helpful for deciphering the monumental exhibition, although it is not necessary to have this background in order to appreciate the art. Foreknowledge or none, Ortega’s pieces are deeply self-reflective and display a striking understanding of human nature. Amidst all the larger than life installations, it is this empathy that shines through most clearly.

If you had asked me when I was little what my concept of vampires was, I would have said something combining Tom Cruise’s portrayal in “Interview with the Vampire” with the goth kids that hung out at the piano-store end of the mall—altogether a frightening image. If you ask most American kids that same question today, they would likely respond with a description of Robert Pattinson.The symbol of the vampire, older than our country, has once again been appropriated for consumption by a modern audience in the shallow form of “Twilight” and the more thoughtful effort, “True Blood,” which possesses some capacity to reasonably incorporate the character’s symbolic relevance to modern issues.In the competition for ultimate domination of the American pop culture sphere, only obnoxious shows about equally obnoxious rich brats from Manhattan can even come close to challenging the vampires. The question, then, is, “Why now?” How can vampires—certainly not a new creation—suddenly be so hot that they’re not just hotter than the girl next door, they are the girl next door? Though Americans have been exposed to vampire lore for centuries in the form of Germanic, Slavic, and African myths, vampires did not really enter the American psyche in earnest until the Victorian Gothic Period in the mid-19th century. The sexual violence and racial miscegenation associated with vampires excited the fears and fetishes of Victorian audiences; the vampire’s bite is often depicted as a sexual kiss and embrace, and the victim’s demise as orgasmic ecstasy.The depiction of vampirism as a blood-borne disease served as a vehicle for fears of racial “pollution.” Tales of vampires often included the fall of a rich and powerful family after one member became infected. Vampires were the Victorian’s perfect symbol for a threat against purity. With the advent of film, vampires made their transition from the page, starting with silent films and continuing all the way to movies like “Blade,” before the current boom. Until recently, even when poetic license was taken with the genre, the portrayal of vampires was relatively aligned with historical conceptions: vampires were strangely erotic, but always fringe and dangerous. In the last few years though, vampires have stood up from the ranks of common horror (aliens, sharks, and murderers) and into an epic spotlight. Now they are the stars of an incredibly successful book franchise, a blooming film franchise, a hit HBO show, a new show on the CW, and the list goes on. How did this happen?The answer: a Mormon from Arizona, author of the “Twilight” series, Stephanie Meyer. While we were all fidgeting over the release of the next “Harry Potter” book in the first half of this decade, Meyer was working away on an idea that would make Potter look disturbingly mainstream-pagan. Before I go any further, here’s a refresher on the “Twilight” series: it’s an allegory for waiting to have sex until after marriage. Charming. Mormonly charming. If you’ve watched or read the first installment, this intention is immediately evident. Kristen Stewart stumbles around onscreen licking her lips in Pavlovian fashion while Robert Pattinson winces a thousand times and whispers that Stewart smells so good—but he just can’t have sex with her... I mean, bite her... I mean, get busy with her... I mean, suck her blood and send her into the immortal undead state of vampires (i.e. people who don’t wear promise rings). In my opinion, Meyer has chosen a strange vehicle to promote premarital celibacy, and in adopting the vampiric image, she’s failed, unsurprisingly, to erase the centuries-old associations and make it her own. Her vampires still stir the same strange Freudian conflation of sex and violence that has captured the attention of Americans since the Victorian era. What’s more, vampires are now being marketed to children, exposing them to content that was once intended for a much more mature, albeit repressed, audience. Meyer and many others today are taking the reins of mythology—steeped in perverse sexuality and racism—without much consideration of the implications of its wholesome family marketing.Meyer’s exploitation of the genre can be contrasted with the recent successes of the series “True Blood” and the Swedish film “Let the Right One In,” which both pay respect to the symbolic origins of vampires while simultaneously playing into modern consciousness. The latter is as incredible as it is frightening, as it recreates the starkly alienated landscape of most childhoods through the eyes of a vampire girl. “True Blood,” based upon a book series by Mississippian Charlaine Harris, plays heavily on the inherent rape-like violence of vampires. Meanwhile, it implicates the presence of racial tension in the South by featuring these fanged characters who threaten the “blood” of others. These attempts have made honest and artistic efforts to expand on the form, rather than irresponsibly misappropriate it.Vampires aren’t going away any time soon. Americans love the possibility of fang-baring sex-violence way too much, and the tabloids have us all invested enough in a possible off-screen romance between Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart to keep watching the movies for another 10 years. On top of all that, vampires are immortal! I bet there are tons of mallrat goths whining about being way ahead of the curve, and I give props to them for still being scary. At the end of the day, though, no matter how historically accurate vampire depiction is or isn’t, I still think pop culture is in need of a silver bullet. I mean more unbridled, non-vampiric sex and violence. I mean a stake in the shape of a cross.—Staff writer Andrew F. Nunnelly can be reached at nunnelly@fas.harvard.edu.

At the start of 2009, Pearl Jam were without a record deal and seemingly without a meaningful future. As the only major survivor of Seattle grunge and 90s mainstream rock to resist implosion, the band, still based in Seattle after all these years, appeared anachronistic, past-it, irrelevant. Beginning with 1996’s “No Code,” and most noticeably with 2000’s “Binaural” and 2003’s “Riot Act,” Pearl Jam produced minor, experimental records, collections of songs in different genres rather than coherent albums. Worst of all, these albums visibly lacked ambition, an inexcusable failing in a band that had once sought to change the world. Increasingly, Pearl Jam were out of sync with the wider marketplace and with the zeitgeist of contemporary rock. As grunge died, they responded by moving into the past, absorbing the traditions of classic rock. The group’s eponymous album was an attempt, in part, to recreate their grunge roots; it was dominated by lean, brief, hard rock songs, but though it attracted some moderate critical approval it soon faded away, having failed to excite even the faithful. With this background, it is almost ridiculous that in 2009—18 years after their debut, “Ten,” and with all five members well into their forties—Pearl Jam should release “Backspacer,” a propulsive, relaxed, enjoyable, and timely album. Few, if any, other bands could have released their finest work in such circumstances and at such a stage in their careers; “Backspacer” is a wonderful, genuine, rare surprise. How were Pearl Jam able to recapture lost magic and acquire magic they never had? Part of the answer seems to be that Pearl Jam has never before been so at ease with themselves. On their early grunge albums, melodramatic tales of abuse and depression fit into a wider theme of anger at the vicissitudes of life. On “Riot Act” and “Pearl Jam,” their most overtly political albums, Eddie Vedder sounded like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders. “Backspacer,” by glorious contrast, features Vedder and the band deriving immense enjoyment from their craft. In every riff and solo, in Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament’s versatile rhythm section and Matt Cameron’s punchy drumming, their pleasure and relaxation can be felt. But the biggest revelation is Vedder. For the first time, the lyrics are upbeat, not dwelling on the world’s woes so much as engaging with the hope of overcoming those difficulties. Of course, many bands sing and play optimistically, but few manage to embody that positivity with the conviction that Pearl Jam does, most evidently on “The Fixer,” the album’s lead single and the song Bono wishes he could write. “When something’s broke, / I want to put a bit of fixin’ on it,” Vedder sings. The lyrics are reminiscent of Coldplay’s 2005 hit “Fix You,” except that where Chris Martin simpered, Vedder sings with irresistible gusto and belief. “The Fixer” is also the best showcase for the band’s newfound verve; it is propelled by a simple but catchy melody, stadium chant chorus, and exhilarated playing. The pervasive optimism is part of what makes the album so timely. With the recession in retreat, and hope and change the buzzwords of a new president, Pearl Jam show that it is possible for rock to embody a new, forward-looking American spirit. The album’s hardest rocking songs are also its most exultant. “Gonna See My Friend,” “Supersonic,” and “Johnny Guitar” have short, punky riffs and sing-along choruses. Memorable hooks and melodies have been a trademark of Pearl Jam’s work from the time “Alive” first blasted through radios in early 1991, but these songs show that the band’s most enduring musical gifts are best suited to positive, not depressive, material. Pearl Jam have finally achieved a kind of comfortable maturity, most evident in the album’s pace. “Backspacer” has several of the slower, contemplative songs that have often been the best showcase for the band’s musicianship and Vedder’s vocals. In the past, the ballads were let down by overbearing, even clumsy lyrics; now, the lyrics are simpler but also more poignant. “Oh, I’m a lucky man / To count on both hands / The ones I love / Some folks just have one / Yeah, others they got none,” Vedder sings on “Just Breathe.” The song has none of the wordplay or metaphor that filled earlier Pearl Jam love songs. But the wistful melody and the subtlest vocal performance of Vedder’s career turn the innocuous lyrics into an achingly beautiful song.No longer does the tempo alternate only between slow and fast, either. “Among the Waves” is a midtempo anthem whose only real precedent is 1998’s fan favorite “Given to Fly”; like that song, “Among the Waves” has tempered verses that lead into a soaring refrain that perfectly enunciates a vision of triumph.Perhaps the frenzied vocals and indelible melodies of “Black” and “Jeremy” will continue for decades to move 14-year-olds and aging Gen-Xers to a place that no other band can reach. But for listeners who don’t fit either of these descriptions, “Backspacer” may well be the first Pearl Jam album they can genuinely enjoy. —Staff writer Keshava D.

They’d been born The Unicorns; they were reincarnated as Islands. Traces of their past life are scattered throughout their third album, “Vapours,” and the ebb and flow of these remnants shape a strange topography; the result lies somewhere in between the new and the old and meshes the two in a vaguely discordant harmony. Islands’ predecessors, The Unicorns, released only one LP in their short lifespan: 2003’s critically-acclaimed work of uniquely sweet synth-pop, “Who Will Cut Our Hair When We’re Gone?” The songs were expansive and luminous masterpieces, eschewing traditional chorus-verse patterns; instead they meshed phrases and instrumentals into confidently organic art. This technique was best exemplified on that album’s most popular track, “Jellybones,” a sparse electronic backbone slowly layered with drumbeats and high, breathy vocals; it was broken briefly by sudden semi-silence, then slipped slowly into not-choruses and not-bridges. The song, and the album itself, dipped indiepop in molten, sugary experimentation. The Unicorns broke up in 2004, but co-frontmen Jaime Thomspon and Nick Thornburn came together soon after to create Islands. “Return to the Sea,” their first album under this new moniker, was released in 2006. It seemed like a natural progression for them. Though it sounded similar, Islands still managed to get inventive, sampling hip-hop and country. It too was well-received, pleasing anxious fans of The Unicorns. But with their second effort, 2008’s “Arm’s Way,” and, most recently, “Vapours,” Islands seems to be moving away from their roots and toward a simpler future; instead of growing they’ve regressed. “Switched On,” for example, is supremely listenable, a song for driving down wooded roads at twilight, windows open, singing casually. The drums start off naked, soon clothed by the high, sweet vocals: “I’ve put on something you can’t switch off”—lyrics vague but cemented in prepositional wordplay. The synth-pop then vaporizes; it is replaced instead by forgettable, whiny lyrics and a typical chorus-verse structure; the uncomfortable dichotomy between past and present resurfaces. Islands once meshed diverse genres with ease, but here they seem unable to merge the slightest structural varieties. Track two, “No You Don’t,” is tainted by the same malaise: as the first single, it oozes with catchiness—but this masks its banality. Its initial simplicity and subsequent slide into a fuller, guitar-heavy phrase is promising; but the utilitarian electronic droplets cascading through the background, coupled with a lack of emotion, flattens the piece. And though the vocals rise high in tone at some points, the volume remains fairly equalized. Such lack of emphasis on any one part kills the piece’s potential arch; without this growth and dénouement, we learn nothing. This cycle of promise and disappointment, however, is broken when the sugarcoated elements collide with the newfound thematic darkness. Simple, major key guitar chords create upbeat melodies—but when paired with the chill of lyrics like “uncross my arms to disarm the car bomb,” the song offers a strange fusion. More fascinating still is when the dark, lo-fi “Shining”—shaded by a slow, monotonous melody and the thick bramble of guitar—meets the sweet introductory swell of “On Foreigners,” a swell shaped by a gradual crescendo of soft, high-pitched voices. This contrast creates for “Vapours” a varied landscape, highs and lows often absent from individual tracks; the album captures the arch the songs lack. “Vapours,” then, edges on success. But Islands’ yesterdays fuse poorly with their todays; moments of harmony are often broken by harsh dissonance. Perhaps without the context of The Unicorns and the expectations set by  “Who Will Cut Our Hair When We’re Gone?” the notes would flow more smoothly,  but the bones of the past do and will resurface in the present; Islands merely needs to embrace them.

Though recent indie rock groups have relied heavily on the choral sound of multi-track vocals—Fleet Foxes, Grizzly Bear, and Sufjan Stevens to name a few—none of them have done it quite as impressively as Bon Iver in “For Emma, Forever Ago,” the 2007 debut album written, performed, and produced by Wisconsinite Justin Vernon. Part of the success of the album was the stark and at-times haunting instrumentation that supported his hymnal voicing. In Vernon’s newest project, an entirely new musical setting from the one established in “For Emma” surrounds these same vocal styles, yet it is just as moving. “Unmap,” is a collaboration with the Milwaukee-based instrumentalists Collection of Colonies of Bees (CoCoB), released under the name Volcano Choir. Though the experimental tracks lack direction at times, the music on “Unmap” blends the sounds of the two bands seamlessly, combining the heartbreaking backwoods emotion of Bon Iver with the textural, ephemeral hooks of CoCoB into an album rich with surprise and intimacy. A clear example of this inherent synergy is the song “Still,” which is actually the Bon Iver song “Woods”—off January’s “Blood Bank” EP—accompanied by numerous synthesizers, guitars, and loops. The original is comprised solely of Vernon singing one melodic line, laced with Auto-Tune, repeated over and over, each time with an added harmony layered on top. While this works nicely, the beefier version on “Unmap” is a hypnotic masterpiece that retains the eeriness of Vernon’s melody while adding a powerful and expressive eclecticism, courtesy of CoCoB.On “Still,” the distinction between Vernon and CoCoB’s contributions is clear, but on “Island, IS,” Volcano Choir prove that they are indeed one cohesive band. The track centers on a mesmerizing guitar and synth riff, enforced by tropical and free-spirited percussion. Vernon’s impassioned harmonies and falsetto fit skillfully on top of the rhythmic loops. The light-heartedness of the instrumentation makes the pathos inherent in Vernon’s voice less grounded, resulting in a track that is simultaneously light and catchy yet deep and moving.The album emerges an intriguing and surprising experiment. Several of the songs are so freeform that they progress along an undetermined path, ending with little resolution or warning. The opening track, “Husks and Shells,” begins with acoustic guitars tuning and warming up in the distance. Eventually, the guitars settle on a melody, but never on a rhythm, and the melody is repeated erratically. In the distance, a faint metronomic beeping and various guitar notes are delicately enhance the natural vibe. In between the seemingly improvised guitars is Vernon’s ethereal humming floating softly above. It sounds genuinely like what the first collaboration must have sounded like; the guitarist warming up in the corner and Vernon slowly taking notice and tenderly joining in, neither of them knowing where it was going, what to do next, or how to stop it.The sense of surprise inherent in “Unmap” is found not only in its painterly collection of noises, but also in the talents of Vernon as a singer and songwriter. It is almost shocking to hear how well the vocals and music in Volcano Choir fit together. This new, more colorful musical setting has the power to alter the passion inherent in Vernon’s vocals and vice versa. “Unmap” seems to prove that even estranged from the broken-heartedness of Bon Iver, Vernon’s music is still stirring.

Most songs off of Mika’s new album, “The Boy Who Knew Too Much,” could have been plucked directly from a musical; in fact, both of his albums, with their kitschy, infectious melodies and impressive vocals, could be described as show tunes for people who don’t listen to show tunes. The overdramatic, theatrical quality of Mika’s music renders it as appropriate for a Broadway stage as for a packed dance club or rowdy road trip sing-along. Characteristic of Mika’s style, this degree of camp can be by turns appealing and irritating. Ever since the 2006 release of his first single, “Grace Kelly,” which catalyzed his rise to worldwide popularity, his unconventional and over-the-top approach has resulted in polarized opinions. However, the real problem with “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” is that, except for occasional moments of originality, it proves to be little more than a rehashed duplicate of his debut album, “Life in Cartoon Motion.”“The Boy Who Knew Too Much” is stylistically almost identical to Mika’s first album, and, aside from a thematic progression from lyrics exploring childhood to those focusing on teenage years, the songs on each album are essentially interchangeable. Mika’s method of addressing his confidant, the title character in “Dr. John,” echoes his pleas to the troubled protagonist of “Billy Brown” on “Life in Cartoon Motion.” The album’s third track, “Rain,” likewise imitates a predecessor, featuring bouncy beats building up tension for a sudden, anthemic chorus in a manner forcefully reminiscent of the first album’s “Relax (Take it Easy).” In an interview with BBC, Mika himself acknowledged this large degree of similarity between the two albums by referring to “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” as “kind of a part two” to his debut album. However, Mika’s new record overlaps with its predecessor rather than acting as its sequel.Despite this lack of originality, “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” is still an incredibly fun listen. Effervescent Europop beats and vocals are juxtaposed with darker themes as Mika explores his teenage years, creating a contrast that is engaging and effective. The album opens with two attention grabbing, upbeat tracks—also the album’s first two singles. On “We Are Golden,” Mika reinvigorates the stale theme of teen angst by pairing it with sugary pop beats, his signature falsetto, and a playfully defiant attitude expressed in lyrics such as “I live for glitter, not you.” With “Blame It on the Girls,” Mika delivers repeatable rhymes such as “he’s got looks that books take pages to tell” and “you could have children and a wife, a perfect little life,” which make the song’s even cheesier aspects, such as the sound of a cork popping open at the mention of a bottle of wine, more bearable. The persistently fast-paced songs, littered with disco beats and captivating choruses, continue until “I See You.” While a respite from the relentless pace of the first half of the album, this slower track proves to be trite and unoriginal. Its cloyingly romantic lyrics verge dangerously towards the cliché: “you mean the world to me but you’ll never know.” Mika’s ability to craft a slow song that does not rely on catchy choruses is much better showcased in “By The Time,” a collaboration with Grammy-nominated English singer Imogen Heap and the album’s true standout. Heap’s ethereal vocals blend beautifully with Mika’s falsetto to lend a hypnotizing effect to the one track that sets “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” apart from “Life in Cartoon Motion.”The overall effect of Mika’s new album is a conflicting one. On the one hand, he is a master of getting listeners to sing along before they have even finished hearing a song; on the other, he subjects his audience to irritating gimmicks such as Backstreet Boys-esque echoing vocals in “Touches You,” a barbershop quartet in “Toy Boy,” and a burst of strings evocative of a Disney movie on the cabaret-style closing track “Pick Up Off the Floor.” Ultimately, “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” provides the same quirky good time that entertained fans of “Life in Cartoon Motion.” Some of the similarities between the two albums, such as their psychedelically eclectic album art, are conducive to Mika’s intended portrayal of “The Boy Who Knew Too Much” as a sequel to his debut album. However, the coincidence between the two is excessive, and those hoping for a new edge to Mika’s style in his sophomore effort will be left disappointed.

In 1988, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan formed The Travelling Wilburys, a popular but unremarkable super-group with no cultural legacy to speak of. Likewise, Monsters of Folk—a super-group comprised of My Morning Jacket’s Jim James, Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis, and M. Ward—are stacked with talent, but even after several years of live collaboration and half a year’s worth of hype, their self-titled debut lacks coherence and originality.“Monsters of Folk” oscillates between Oberst’s tired country tropes and James’ burnt-out classic rock riffs. The numbers that feature M. Ward’s vocals provide consistently solid songwriting, offering several truly fantastic tracks on an album that, on the whole, feels slap-dash, poorly executed, and only mildly enjoyable.On tracks like “Say Please” and “Losin’ Yo’ Head,” MoF tries their hand at classic rock. “Say Please” features a simple beat and several haphazard attempts at hair-pin transitions and rhythmic shifts that leave the song spun-out and wrecked behind them. The song is also hindered by its even-handed verse distribution; the transitions between singers make the song feel incoherent and contrived. The more-focused “Losin’ Yo’ Head”—with James taking lead vocals throughout—is catchier, but still comes across as uninteresting classic rock emulation. Oberst takes lead vocals on irritating country tracks that sound like pre-pubescent Johnny Cash imitations. On “Man Named Truth,” easily the album’s worst track, Oberst attempts to weave a forced narrative—something about heroin and Aztec gold—over a clichéd, country backing track that sounds like something from a bad karaoke machine.Between these two, unfortunate extremes—uninspired classic rock and trite country—lies the heart of the album. Oberst redeems himself with “Ahead of the Curve,” a powerful number built around a memorable acoustic guitar riff that tastefully expands into a full-band number. A more restrained Oberst recalls his best work as Bright Eyes, filling the song with beautiful, rapidly successive lines like “staying above the flat-line / I’m ahead of the curve / take a piece of the sunshine with me on an all-night drive to another world” and the poignantly direct opening line: “Another perfect day / They keep piling up / I got happiness that I can’t maintain / so beginner’s luck.”The most successful contributor of the three vocalists, however, is unquestionably M. Ward. “The Sandman, the Brakeman and Me” is the best track on the album and serves as a melancholic insight into what could have been if MoF had produced a more carefully constructed album. The song breathes through the speakers at first, picked up by M. Ward’s croon, imbued with phonographic warmth and evocative lyrics: “The Sandman’s waiting to deliver me my dream / Guess I’ll lay my head against the elbow and the window / and watch the wheels go.” Then it builds, swept away by M. Ward’s chugging, steam-engine strum and Oberst’s tense splashes of lap steel that lead it into a blazing release. When Jim James’ rich harmonies fan across the track, it’s likes seeing “The Wizard of Oz” go from black-and-white to flaming Technicolor for the first time.At the end of “Losin’ Yo’ Head,” there’s a brief studio dialogue between the Monsters. Someone says “That’s pretty cool,” and the others mutter their bemused agreement. Ultimately, that attitude of “wouldn’t-it-be-cool-if” leads to some generally good but poorly executed ideas that pale significantly in contrast to the album’s several standout tracks. The true gems here are the few songs like “Slow Down Jo” and “The Brakeman, the Sandman and Me” where these formidable indie-folkers combine forces to create nuanced, coherent songs.Ultimately, the fundamental issue with this album is what plagues all super-groups: an effort to evenly distribute the work between several disparate, equally unique voices who do not commonly work together leading to an album that lacks both consistency and coherence. While often engaging for the same reasons that My Morning Jacket, Bright Eyes and M. Ward separately are engaging, the album as a whole falls short of the combined songwriters’ potential. In the end, the album is almost saved by those four tracks that match any Pitchfork-induced fantasies about the sounds that M. Ward, Conor Oberst, and Jim James would produce if given the chance to collaborate, but these tracks alone cannot make up for the unfocused and occasionally uninteresting nature of the rest.

Elaborate costumes, gorgeous cinematography, British accents, a doomed romance—on paper, writer and director Jane Campion’s “Bright Star” contains all the elements of an effective period romance. And yet the film—which centers on the burgeoning love between Romantic poet John Keats and his neighbor Fanny Brawne—proves disappointing, permanently handicapped by its lack of dramatic tension. Ben Whishaw (“Brideshead Revisited”) and Abbie Cornish (“Stop-Loss”) are wholly convincing as the movie’s tragic couple, but that is in some ways precisely the problem. Their strong bond is never counterbalanced by a force of sufficient magnitude which could plausibly stifle it. Because the viewer is not presented with any roadblock that should be capable of irreparably harming their relationship, the fact that the two lovers are fated to never consummate their love weakens the film’s dramatic drive.At the film’s start, the primary source of conflict stems from Keats’ roommate, supporter, and friend, fellow poet Charles Armitage Brown. Brown, played with gusto by Paul Schneider (“Lars and the Real Girl”), disapproves of the relationship between Keats and Brawne and actively attempts to dissuade his friend from pursuing her. This conflict climaxes in a heated argument between the three parties after Brown delivers a mock valentine to Brawne.Had Campion chosen to focus solely on this triangular relationship, perhaps elaborating on the reasons why Brown was so staunchly opposed to his friend’s relationship, she could have composed an engaging romance. However, almost directly following the aforementioned argument, the primary source of conflict clumsily segues into Keats’ financial situation. This dilemma only manifests itself through Brawne’s mother and her high-society friends, who make a few mildly disapproving comments about Keats. With the introduction of this subplot, Brown’s coarse wit disappears from the film, eliminating one of its sole sources of entertainment. Campion—who won a Best Original Screenplay Oscar for 1993’s “The Piano”—displays a dependence on emotionality that harms the film’s narrative flow. The middle section of “Bright Star” becomes an exercise in tedium, as the film first shows the happiness of the young couple, then the sadness Brawne feels when Keats must visit the countryside for financial reasons, then the joy she experiences when he writes her a letter, then the sadness she suffers when time passes with no word. There is no cohesive narrative structure to support Brawne’s baffling shifts in extreme emotions, and as such the film is reduced to a series of dramatically disparate moments.Moreover, the plot’s implications become exceedingly confusing, as the viewer simply cannot reconcile Brawne’s excessive declarations of love—at one point she compares her feelings when she is not with Keats to suffocation—with the poet’s apparent disinterest. Does Keats simply not feel the same way as Brawne? Does the poet’s loyalty or fiscal obligation to Brown simply supersede his love? Sadly, this confusion seems entirely unintentional.The film’s finale only exacerbates these narrative faults. After falling ill, Keats is instructed to leave the country for gentler climes. His reasons for leaving his “true love” behind remain unconvincing. The only answer the film provides is that the poet feels indebted to his friends for paying for his voyage. The lovers’ teary goodbye is therefore marked by the same frustrating passivity characteristic of the film as a whole. As noted, “Bright Star” is not a wholly disappointing experience. The actors uniformly deliver strong performances, only occasionally lapsing into facile sentimentalism. The cinematography is especially charming, and silent sequences highlighting the splendor of the countryside and the complexity of Brawne’s needlework are arrestingly beautiful. Poetry buffs will also likely delight in hearing Keats’ work in a different context; it is particularly interesting to hear his theories on poetry and the role of the poet as delivered to Brawne in a flirtatious tutoring session.“Bright Star” is a frustrating film. Though it is technically proficient, its narrative failures make the film a chore to sit through. After all, if the two lovers do not think their love worth fighting for, why should a viewer want to watch their tragedy unfold?—Staff writer Bram A.

There is perhaps no country as obsessed with its own capital city as France is with Paris. From the moment René Clair lowered a camera down the center of the Eiffel Tower in 1925 to capture spectacular views of the city in “Paris qui dort,” French filmmakers have been unable to tear their attention away from the City of Light. This is unfortunate for Cédric Klapisch, previously the director of “L’Auberge Espagnole,” a 2002 sleeper hit popular enough to inspire a 2005 sequel, with another in the works. In his latest film, “Paris,” Klapisch squanders both his own considerable skill and creativity and that of the majority of his cast on a paean to the city that borrows shamelessly from other, better movies—the plot of “Rear Window,” the ensemble structure of “Magnolia,” and the underlying philosophy of “Amélie.” “Paris” follows the tribulations of Pierre (Romain Duris), a dancer whose routines involve more feather boas than real talent. Fortunately for the audience, we are only subjected to a few flashbacks of his career; Pierre has a severe heart disease and now spends his time observing his fellow Parisians while he waits for an operation that promises only a 50 percent chance of saving his life. His sister, Élise (Juliette Binoche), moves into his apartment to take care of him while struggling with her own romantic difficulties. The plot then alternates between Pierre and Élise’s battles against illness and loneliness, and the lives of other Parisians, many of whom are only tangentially related to the main characters.The most compelling element of the film is easily Binoche’s portrayal of Élise, a kindly single mother who is not above snapping at panhandlers and entering homes under false pretenses to get her brother a date. Unfortunately, Duris, who also starred in “L’Auberge Espagnole,” does not bring the same life to Pierre. As he comes to terms with his illness, Pierre’s voyeurism becomes increasingly creepy, and Duris’ attempts at understatement fail to make these scenes work. When he contacts his childhood crush to inform her that he is still in love with her, he invites neither pity nor disgust; the audience simply wonders when Klapisch will grant us another scene with Binoche. Because Pierre’s experiences are the foundation of the movie, even the talent of Binoche and the solid cinematography can’t salvage “Paris.” The vignettes about other Parisians are much stronger than Pierre’s scenes, particularly the story of Benoît (Kingsley Kum Abang), a hotel waiter who immigrates to Paris from Cameroon. The images of his dusty village are colorful but forlorn, and his conversations with a supermodel staying at his hotel are rich with political subtext absent from Pierre’s self-indulgent monologues. It’s a shame that Klapisch didn’t set the entire film in Cameroon; perhaps it would have had the substance and originality that “Paris” strives for but doesn’t achieve. Klapisch still proves himself a master at directing awkward interactions, and some of the film’s best acted and most affecting moments come at the expense of characters that have just said too much or too little. About halfway through the film, there is a delightful, computer-animated dream sequence that seems to herald a more imaginative turn. This is followed by several clever and visually striking set pieces involving the secondary characters, but unfortunately Klapisch is unable to maintain his momentum. The film lurches into a forced ending in which many of the loose ends are tied up just a bit too cleanly, and Pierre helpfully offers the moral of the story in a voiceover for those who haven’t figured it out by that point. Klapisch seems to be directing on autopilot, producing a mildly engaging trifle until he can return to the characters from “L’Auberge,” a less ambitious but far more satisfying film. But “Paris” does suggest a more serious, polished direction for Klapisch. If this is the case, and if his lovely Cameroon vignette is more than a throwaway nod to Paris’ immigrants, he may yet have a great film on his horizon. He just needs to look outside of Paris.

Paul Aufiero is best described as a man-child. At 35, he lives with his mom, thinks that 10:46 p.m. is a little late to be heading out to a party, and sleeps with a poster of his idol, fictional New York Giants star Quantrell Bishop, above his bed. In writer-director Robert Siegel’s new movie “Big Fan,” Paul becomes the unlikely subject of an engaging and darkly humorous character study. Building on his work with 2008’s critically acclaimed “The Wrestler,” Siegel puts a new spin on the culture of athletic obsession, glimpsing into the life of a pathetic fan on the cusp of middle age.Paul (Patton Oswalt) lives for the New York Giants, calling into radio shows with pre-scripted diatribes about how his team will make it to the Super Bowl this year. When he’s not working as a parking attendant, he sits outside the football stadium, watching games on a small TV rather than sitting in the bleachers. His ongoing call-in war with mysterious Eagles fan “Philadelphia Phil” (Michael Rapaport) probably gives him the greatest sense of purpose his humble life has ever known.Oswalt—whose previous credits include voicing Remy the Rat in “Ratatouille”—gives an evocative and authentic performance. His naturally chubby physique complements his character’s infantile personality, both of which serve to present a man at odds with the world around him. Paul’s obsession extends beyond the realm of football; he’s created a lifestyle of blithe immobility and self-neglect on which he refuses to loosen his grip. Even his most immature moments—yelling at his mother for interrupting his 15 seconds of radio fame, scarfing down Chinese food and Mountain Dew until his head aches—act as part of a system Paul has developed for himself to resist his increasingly evident lack of a career or family.On a boring night out with friend and fellow Giants fanatic Sal (Kevin Corrigan), Paul happens to run into Quantrell Bishop at a nightclub. The conversation takes a turn for the worse and Paul ends up brutally beaten by Bishop and hospitalized for a number of days. Paul’s family wants to see him enact the revenge he deserves in court, but Paul just want to see Bishop off the ineligible list and back on the gridiron. Being assaulted by an idol may be far-fetched, but the surreal conflict presents the familiar challenge of balancing one’s personal loyalties.The rest of the characters serve primarily as sources of advice and criticism for Paul. His brother is an ambulance-chasing lawyer with a vapid trophy wife, his friend Sal only encourages his rabid fandom, and his mother has long since given up attempting to make him to do anything with his life. While these characters are realistic archetypes, each one performs a single function and never deviates from that purpose. (As Philadelphia Phil, Rapaport spends almost all of his scant eight minutes of screen time chanting and jeering in a sports bar).Though the plot leaves a few loose ends, these work within the film’s internal logic. The Quantrell Bishop storyline is abandoned in order to focus on Paul’s meeting with Philadelphia Phil, but in the scope of the film, this makes sense. Paul never follows through on his commitments or interactions. He is content to simply let things go, so long as he can resume cheering for the team he loves.Siegel, formerly a writer for The Onion, has a knack for crafting characters that aren’t exactly living the dream. This was evident in “The Wrestler” and is echoed here. But rather than portray a man who has fallen from former glory, his directorial debut brings to life a character that has never and will never achieve glory, or any semblance of an independent life above mediocrity. This choice makes “Big Fan” perhaps a more pessimistic movie, but one with a perspective just as thoughtful.

In October of 1975, 17-year-old Alistair Little, approached the window of the Griffin family household and shot 19-year-old Jim Griffin three times. Jim’s younger brother, Joe, frozen by the sight of the gun in the masked man’s hand, stood in the street 10 feet away and watched Jim die.With this event as an historical backdrop, “Five Minutes of Heaven” director Oliver Hirschbiegel probes the intensely personal nature of the divisive conflict that has plagued Ireland over the last century. Best known for “Downfall,” his Oscar-nominated 2004 chronicle of Hitler’s final days, Hirschbiegel again humanizes a seemingly irredeemable man to create a fascinating drama that explores the difficulties of reconciliation in many of today’s intractable conflicts. Focusing on the fictional meeting of real-life Irish citizens Joe Griffin (James Nesbitt, “Millions”) and Alistair Little (Liam Neeson) 33 years after the murder that connected them, the film traces the human cost of violence that permeated a society. Elders are the villains in Hirschbiegel’s vision. It is their inability to forgive what has been done to them and their willingness to compromise their own children that fuels this cycle. As a teenager, Little takes on his mission to kill Jim Griffin in order to achieve acceptance and respect from his Protestant elders. Joe is motivated to consider revenge against Little not because of his brother’s death, but because of the emotional trauma caused by his mother, who blames him for Jim’s death. Since being released from prison, Little has found financial success as a sort of poster boy for reconciliation, helping inmates and former gang members come to terms with what they’ve done. Despite this, as the film progresses it becomes clear Little is as much of a victim as Joe Griffin. His guilt has prevented him from ever starting a family or developing any kind of social life.While Griffin has been able to raise a healthy family, his relationship with his two daughters continues the theme of parents as a potentially destructive influence. His growing preoccupation with revenge pulls him away from his family, even causing him to physically lash out at his wife. This point is further emphasized when Little’s first piece of advice upon their meeting is to give himself wholly to his children.Nesbitt’s performance is extremely effective; his tics, shakes, and darting eyes build on one another until he seems to be held together by nothing save his trembling cigarette. He evokes ample sympathy throughout the film, but when his plans to kill Little are revealed, one can’t help but feel pity and a measure of disgust for his delusion that it would change anything. Liam Neeson’s sympathetic and tortured portrayal of Alistair Little marks a departure from his normal role as powerful, authoritative, decision-maker. His regret is palpable, and his permanently haunted look demonstrates the suffering of an individual who it would have otherwise been very easy to root against.Throughout the film the tension builds to an almost unbearable level, particularly as their meeting is deferred, even by moments, again and again. When they finally meet, the release of this tension is explosive, all the more so because time has eclipsed and brought to light the realization that revenge is futile here. Hirschbiegel’s insights are telling, albeit conventional. From Ireland to Rwanda, people whose lives were destroyed by violence are forced to live next door to those who supported, colluded with, or tacitly approved of their parents’ executioners, and no culture of vendetta can repair the damage already done. The choice between vengeful gratification and reconciliation—or whatever approximation is possible—is a daily one, and one skillfully realized by “Five Minutes of Heaven.”

Alternative futures call for alternative language. “1984” had Newspeak, “A Clockwork Orange” had Nadsat—each distorted, disorienting vocabulary a warning of possible ills. In “The Year of the Flood,” her most recent novel and the second in a series of three, Margaret Atwood similarly invents a dictionary for her post-apocalyptic world. But her words are amusing than ominous—the lexicon for a dystopian vision at once entertaining and insubstantial. Atwood’s way with words should come as no surprise. The Canadian author has dozens of works (novels, books of poetry and even a libretto) to her name and a basket of prizes in her honor (a Guggenheim Fellowship and the 2000 Booker Prize for “The Blind Assassin”). A blend of genres—pulp, sci-fi, revelation—has distinguished her writing as among the most imaginative of the last half-century.But it is above all her affection for language that makes her fiction interesting. Atwood picks at words, she turns them over, she peers at them, she reshapes them, as if searching for some secret behind the letters—“It’s daybreak. The break of day... What breaks in daybreak?”—Atwood won’t let words rest. In the “The Year of the Flood”, she unravels and warps them, so that the surrealistic world she creates seems to stem from a perversion of its own language. There are pigoons (pigs with human organs) and mo’hairs (sheep which grow human hair for wigs) both products of the “Corps”—an alliance of corporations (among them, Happicuppa, HelthWyzer, CyroJeenyus) whose laboratories and workers live in gated communities. Outside the Corps are the Pleeblands, a proto-Gotham, but with grosser food and nastier crime. There’s something revolting and enchanting about Atwood’s creations—a fast food chain called “SecretBurgers: Because Everyone Loves A Secret” or “Painball,” a security facility in which convicts shoot at each other with corrosive paint—perhaps because they are so playful. But Atwood never loses her edge. When the titular flood wipes away humanity, it comes not in sheets of rain but as a plague contained in the inoffensively named pill BlyssPluss. The Flood is at the heart of the story—its imminence dictates the actions of God’s Gardeners, a religious environmental group to which survivors Ren and Toby once belonged. A “plural Noah”, the Gardeners consider themselves as destined to survive while the wicked are destroyed. “We must be ready for the time when those who have broken trust with the Animals… will be swept away by the Waterless Flood, which will be carried on the wings of God’s dark Angles that fly by night, and in airplanes and helicopters and bullet trains, and on transport trucks and other such conveyances,” says Adam One, their leader, in one of his sermons. The fringe Gardeners are more conscientious than the residents of the “Exfernal World” around them: Much of the action of the novel takes place on their rooftop plots, where they prepare “Ararats” and teach each other foraging skills while singing hymns or praying to a pantheon of beatified scientists (Dian Fossey, Rachel Carson, Euell Gibbons). As a result, they are also more boring. Even with intra-cult intrigue, and Atwood’s skillfully crafted futuristic sermons, the Gardeners simply don’t rival the garish inhabitants of the Pleeblands. Even Ren complains of her lackluster surroundings. “The street kids—the pleebrats—were hardly rich, but they were glittery… I envied their gaudy freedom.”Atwood is better at inventing things than at setting them in motion and, at times, her plot does not live up to her creations. The pacing is uneven. Ren and Toby each spend much of the novel isolated from the rest of the world, so often there’s more memory than movement. Towards the end, the action becomes rigid and rushed—a confusing wrap-up of the first two novels in the series and an off-tone set-up for the third. The arrival of characters from “Oryx and Crake,” the trilogy’s first, that make the situation especially untenable. All at once, too many characters are butting up against each other in the post-apocalyptic desert.  This may be a blow to the book’s faint cautionary undertones. For a novel about a plague that kills off our depraved progeny, “The Year of the Flood” is too colorful and  too absurd to carry weight as a warning. The soft cries of distress “We’re using up the earth. It’s almost gone,” can’t stand up to Atwood’s showy vocabulary. Without a strong foundation of action and emotion, the novel comes across as more of a literary burlesque than a dystopian drama. There’s no real meat to Atwood’s novel and even the witty funhouse creations leave one hungry for something more substantial than a SecretBurger.—Staff writer Madeleine M. Schwartz can be reached at mschwartz@fas.harvard.edu.

Cobwebs of conspiracy, visible only by glimpses of light filtered through the haze of pot smoke, bind fast the decadent and insular isle of Manhattan in Jonathan Lethem’s newest novel, “Chronic City.” The protagonist, Chase Insteadman—a former child star living off re-run residuals—serves as both one of a cohort of sleuths trying to untangle these webs and a vessel for the reader’s own desire to do the same. His seemingly infinite naïveté parallels our own; his paranoia is ours; and when revelations unfold, they’re for us, not just Chase. But in spite of this gambit, and the inherent ambition behind any setting as complex as this one, Lethem spoon-feeds the reader tropes from contemporary literature instead of developing anything uniquely satisfying, rendering “Chronic City” otherwise insubstantial.The novel begins as Insteadman’s meets one Perkus Tooth, an aging, roving-eyed rock critic and strikingly disparate figure whose hovel on 84th street provides the setting for much of the rest of the story. Tooth serves as the wellspring for the paranoia that motivates much of the book, and brokers Chase’s introduction to the other major players, Oona Laszlo and Richard Abneg.Chase and Tooth shortly develop a fast, if strange friendship defined by Perkus’ love for marijuana, cheeseburgers, coffee, and esoterica. Their daily smoke sessions serve an indoctrinatory function as well: Tooth enmeshes both Chase and the reader in the interconnections between things as seemingly disparate as Marlon Brando, “Gnuppets” (cf. Muppets), and the redemption of New York City at large. The level of associations starts small at first, focusing on relations between obscure film directors and their actors. As the plot progresses, however, the associations link one into another until they ensnare the entire world of the novel.Insteadman splits his time between Manhattan’s high society, where he is a fixture more for his headline-garnering astronaut fiancée—Janice Trumbull, whose reentry to earth is blocked by Chinese space mines—than for his good looks or former stardom. Its here that he meets Abneg, a mayor’s aide who recognizes Chase as a disciple of Perkus and helps to close the gap between the foggy reality of 84th street and the rest of the world.Laszlo is a cynical and withdrawn ghostwriter who fully cinches the two realms. Her character fuels the notion that everything is merely a façade through her work, her observations, and her dalliances with Chase.Lethem’s strengths as a writer keep the book moving along at a brief and exciting clip. His prose is always evocative and his diction breathes life into his characters and their surroundings. “If one of money’s laws is that it can never buy taste, here is where it went after it failed, and here’s what it brought instead,” writes Lethem of Manhattan. The narrative flow, dictated almost entirely by Chase—save for a few exceedingly emotive letters penned by his spacey fiancée and a few events that occur on the periphery of his story—is dimpled with beautifully concise and vivid encapsulations of the utterly mundane and the extraordinary alike.The letters Janice writes to Chase, for example, as the length of her space stay drives her slowly zanier, are worth falling in love over. The detailed precision of her reminiscences delicately counter the truly heartfelt and heartbreaking sentiments she struggles with at other moments. “I see only myself and a shimmer beside me, you’re nothing now but an urgent elusive talisman, an object glimpsed but unseen, a fish’s lure in the deep, a reason to go on living. And I do that, Chase. At someone’s command, and I prefer to believe it is yours, my friend, I go on living,” she closes one letter.The third person narrative structure of the book is also one of its strengths. Being bound by the stupidity of Chase, the invested reader will chomp at the bit for more and more information, but Lethem holds fast to his kernels of truth until their revelation is all the more satisfying. Every detail of the book gains retrospective significance as the puzzle pieces slowly sort themselves into place, making it almost necessary to read the book at least twice. There are very few discontinuities, and those that exist don’t hurt the text in any way.	But Lethem’s aptitude with the pen has never been in question.  A winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for his novel “Motherless Brooklyn,” he has already established himself as an elite member of the community of American fiction. Where “Chronic City” falters is in its failure to adequately deal with its own extra-textual subtext.Wild animals are a repeated motif throughout the novel. A tiger that may or may not actually be some sort of digging machine rampages through the city, destroying whole buildings and causing general inconvenience. A pair of bald eagles seem to hunt Abneg, and at one point, a whale makes its way up the East River nearly to Hell’s Gate before dying.This motif seems to speak in general to the control or lack thereof wielded by the invisible powers-that-be behind most of the action in the book. But some of the discrete animal appearances may just be references to contemporary news coverage—the eagles could refer to a hawk problem New York City faced not too long ago, and a polar bear on an ice floe may also have a cultural analogue. The whale, in particular, seems to also imply another question, especially when paired with a reference to “Moby Dick” later on in the work—a question about the future of the American novel and its past. Yet Lethem offers no discernable answers, and trying to disassemble his pastiche of cultural references isn’t worth half the effort he clearly put into creating it.“Chronic City” prevails as a captivating and enjoyable piece of fiction, but if Lethem intended it to be as meta-analytical and thought-provoking as the glimpses of this material might suggest, he certainly fails to get his point across in any meaningful way.—Staff writer Joshua J. Kearney can be reached at kearney@fas.harvard.edu.

Midway through “Generosity,” Richard Powers’ stunning new novel, the charming businessman and geneticist Robert Kurton participates in a public debate with an unnamed novelist. The subject: genetic enhancement of human beings. The shy author begins, awkwardly reading from a prewritten speech. But his argument is complex, as Powers writes, “The writer’s thought is so dense that every clause tries to circle back for another try before plunging on.” Even the narration has trouble following the train of thought. Kurton takes stage, joking, “Every divide between the Two Cultures is bridgeable, except this one: humanists write out their talks and scientists extemporize.” With his mixture of humorous anecdotes and general charisma, Kurton emerges the clear winner. Modernity, Powers illustrates, shuffles the artist’s and the scientist’s roles: as the artist appeals to reason, the scientist to emotion and narrative.This conflation of the sciences and the humanities is perhaps the most identifiable characteristic about Powers’s work, be it via virtual reality in 2000’s “Plowing the Dark” or artificial intelligence in 1995’s “Galatea 2.2.” He succeeds again in “Generosity,” his tenth novel, this time in bringing contemporary science into the dramatic foreground by exploring the world of genetic enhancement. “Generosity” follows the lives of an unusually jubilant Algerian refugee, Thassa Amzwar, and her creative nonfiction instructor, Russell Stone, as they and the rest of America respond to Kurton’s announcement. The scientist’s latest initiative has discovered a convincing correlation between a particular set of genes and emotional temperament: for all intents and purposes, a ‘happiness gene.’ After it is confirmed that Thassa suffers from this genetic predisposition to happiness, she becomes an overnight Internet celebrity. The book charts Thassa’s rise through the blogosphere all the way up to “The Oona Show” (a fictional analog for Oprah), until she reaches a level of fame whose pressure threatens to break even her seemingly indominable happiness.Powers thus combines the recent public attention to the positive psychology movement, genetic enhancement, and the democratic atmosphere of the internet into a novel that examines happiness from a thoroughly modern—and therefore highly empirical—standpoint. “How programmed are we?” Russell vulnerably begs. His girlfriend, a therapist, responds honestly, but then adds encouragingly, “Temperament can self-modify. People can get free, or at least a little freer.” This is not enough for Russell, who laments, “But not as free as we’re bred to believe we are.” Science, while altering our contemporary conception of happiness, changes none of our feelings of not having it. In a moral environment split between the fast moving, forward-looking pharmaceutical industry and the ineffectually resistant humanities, Powers does not take sides, but considers the issue from both points of views, simultaneously. “Generosity” thereby succeeds in engaging its scientific subject matter honestly, and therefore that much more significantly. It is this respect for—but distance from—the science that allows Powers to arrive at the book’s core issue: Genetic engineering, for all the moral qualms that arise from it, gives humanity a chance to rewrite, to edit, to choose its own genetic story.This is the central idea behind the novel, and “Generosity” explores it in endless, and often brilliant, variations. Russell’s subject—creative nonfiction—is exactly what genetic enhancement is: reality, just with some creativity, to make it something you want to read about. The book he chooses to teach from, which itself is fictional, is called “Make Your Writing Come Alive,” which describes what DNA is: a language that has created life. The connections drawn between writing and DNA early on in the book shape a theme emergent in many of Powers’ books, that of analogues to writing itself.What makes the book truly interesting resides in Powers’s ability to be formally experimental while remaining fully readable, and totally earnest. A strange, authorial “I” punctuates the book, deliberating the text’s future and reflecting on its past. “I know what kind of story I’d make from this one, if I could: the kind that, from one word to the next, breaks free. The kind that invents itself out of meaningless detail and thin air. The kind in which there’s no choice like chance.” We are not merely reading a story, but rather we are watching the creation of a story, like a life form rising from dancing nucleotides. Powers’s books have a propensity to remind the reader of their role, yet nowhere in his oeuvre does he do it so thoroughly, or effectively, as in “Generosity.” Powers manages this postmodern trope without creating an ironic distance. There is the prevailing sentiment that Powers has too much at stake to mask his work in the presumptions of irony. Far from simply instructing the reader, Powers is discovering his truths as he writes. As the book self-consciously asserts itself as a novel being written by a novelist, one can sense it struggling with the rush of mediums we’re subjected to as modern Americans. “Generosity” moves out of prose, adopting styles that range from mimicking a  screenplay—in a particularly moving scene—to a collage of YouTube videos. Instead of rejecting changing modes of communication, Powers accepts them, explores them, and engages with them on their own terms.In the above mentioned debate scene, after Kurton’s engaging response, the unidentified novelist changes his tone. He gives up, tells the audience, the whole species, to “go enhance.” But he issues a warning: “We’ll never feel enhanced… When fiction goes real, reality will need a more resistant strain of fiction.”This is why Powers, among his likeminded contemporaries, is worth reading. Time and time again, he provides us with more and more resistant strains of fiction. The humanities, resisting science, seem to want to hold it back so that the old truths hold. Powers, on the other hand, is positively straining to see what’s coming, writing with the passion of the discoverers in the sestet of Keats’ “On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer.” In a world that is, above all, confused by its own amazing progress, Powers is a stabilizing force, taking a step back, slowing down, to show us, our hearts and heads alike, what we are doing, and where we are going.The book’s final punchline comes from its subtitle. Just about every cover of a Powers book has the subtitle: “A Novel.” For “Generosity,” the subtitle is: “An Enhancement.” Here is where Powers’s ability to transcend the boundaries of the story simply shines. As genetic enhancement is the insertion of an externally synthesized gene into the human genome, a novel is an externally synthesized story added to the reader’s memory, the reader’s experience. Reading gives us a chance to live other lives, to experience things we otherwise wouldn’t have, to make mistakes on the page so that we don’t have to make them in real life. In this way, we leave the novel, letting our eyes adjust to the light of the real, changed, with a new experience doing its work in us that will effect us for the rest of our lives. We leave our reading experience, ourselves enhanced.

“Putting It Together” is the musical theater equivalent of Frankenstein’s monster. Just as Igor was dispatched to gather brains, arms, and legs from graves, so too does writer Stephen Sondheim pull together parts of other works to form a completely new whole. Opening tonight in the Loeb Experimental Theater, this revue of Sondheim’s work aptly combines songs from disparate musicals to form a “Reader’s Digest” of his oeuvre. For the director and cast, it’s simultaneously a simple, bountiful musical buffet and a complicated structural feat.The show, Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s first production of the semester, amounts to much more than the gaudy, corporate-mandated greatest hits parade it could have devolved into. Cast member Adam M. Lathram ’10 notes Sondheim’s creative control in praising the show’s structure: “What’s interesting is that the songs are all very different, unique, and identifiable, but somehow [Sondheim] managed to weave a story from them.”The cast consists of only five, unnamed characters—a young couple, an older couple, and a mysterious observer—who convene for one night at a penthouse cocktail party. There’s little dialogue. Single words, spoken by the observer, motivate the transitions from song to song. Fortunately, every actor in the cast is or has been a member of a Harvard a capella group, so they’re up to the vocal challenge.Lathram is joined by fellow HRDC veterans Christine K.L. Bendorf ’10, Matthew I. Bohrer ’10, Walter B. Klyce III ’10, and Jordan A. Reddout ’10. This cast is especially seasoned when it comes to Sondheim. 2008’s “Sweeney Todd” featured not only Lathram and Bendorf, but also the musical director of “Putting it Together,” Benjamin J. Nelson ’11. Last fall, “Assassins” showcased Bohrer, Klyce, and director Stewart N. Kramer ’12.For Kramer, who will helm the Dunster House Opera in February, “Putting It Together” marks his directorial debut. The most recent major revival of “Putting It Together,” which opened on Broadway 10 years ago, was a disappointment to him, sacrificing meaning in favor of cuteness and kitsch. “I know kitsch is sometimes unavoidable in musical theater,” he jests, “but I try to avoid it as much as possible.” For Kramer, the greatest challenge of this production was interpreting the narrative created by this sequence of songs, considering the context of each in its original show as well as its place in this one.Another difficulty faced by the production staff is their quickly approaching opening date. Klyce acknowledges the difficulties of their timeslot, saying, “[Producing a show] so early in the year can be very hit or miss.” Smiling as he corrects himself, he adds, “But this one’s not a miss. It’s a hit.” Wary of the complications of scheduling rehearsals amidst classes, extracurriculars, and other auditions, the cast convened at the house of producer Megan M. Savage ’10 for a few days in August to discuss the show and learn the music.The title of the show is taken from a song in “Sunday in the Park with George,” which appears in the first act. The songs Sondheim chose for “Putting It Together” come from both monster hits like “Company” and “Sweeney Todd” and lesser known works like “The Frogs,” a critical success that failed to gain a popular following. As Klyce puts it, “Some of the songs [in ‘Putting It Together’] you’ll know and love, the rest will make you think, ‘This is a great song, why haven’t I heard it before?’”As fundamentally fragmented as the play’s structure may be, however, Kramer and his talented cast seem more than capable of pulling it off. Regardless of how it will be ultimately welded together, it is undeniable that they’re working with some rich ore. Kramer, perhaps, sums it up best: “Sondheim is fantastic. This is a given.”

British poet Simon Armitage has had a prolific writing career. Beginning with his first collection of poems in 1989 and spanning 13 volumes since, Armitage’s poetry has grown up with a whole generation of British children, taking its place in the high school English literature curriculum alongside Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney. As well as teaching creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University in the United Kingdom, Armitage embarks regularly on reading tours and on Tuesday, he held a poetry reading in the Woodberry Poetry Room in the Houghton Library.Armitage’s profile has been steadily rising over the past 15 years since he quit his job as a probation officer and became a full-time poet. His output is marked by an impressive versatility; he has written for radio and TV, produced song lyrics for award-winning musical documentaries, and translated a gem of the medieval literary canon, “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,” into modern English verse. Primarily, though, he is a lyric poet, specializing in “lively, mysterious, revelatory” poems, according to English Professor James Simpson, who introduced Armitage at the Woodberry event.In recent years, though, Armitage has turned to the subject of war in his work. In 2008 he published “The Not Dead,” a collection of poems inspired by the testimonies of veterans from the Gulf, Bosnian, and Malayan wars. He is currently contemplating a trip to Afghanistan to produce a documentary for the BBC and to gather material for poems based on conversations with British troops. Armitage says he is aware that such a project would be fraught with ethical and logistical difficulties. “I certainly wouldn’t go there with the idea of becoming a spokesperson for the army or an apologist for the war,” he says. “I’m interested in human stories, in what it takes for a young man or a young woman to leave home at 18 years old and suddenly find themselves transported into a situation where they might be killed for their country, about what it is to miss people, and what it is to come home.”In his poetry, Armitage has often focused on telling the stories of others, most notably in “Feltham Sings,” a 2002 documentary set in a young offenders’ institution near London. Responding to transcribed interviews with inmates, Armitage produced song lyrics for each to perform on camera, with the aim of empowering them to tell their own stories. One song began, “Brother did time, mother did time, uncle did time, now it’s my turn.” Despite his commitment to remaining “neutral”in these projects—which blend lyric poetry with documentary and biography—Armitage conceives of them as acts of artistic and social generosity. “A lot of people that we worked with have never had anything given to them,” Armitage says, “so for somebody to write a poem for them, taking into account their language and their situation, and give it back to them... that can be a very meaningful experience.”Although Armitage has demonstrated a serious commitment to performing his poetry both internationally and within the UK—next year he plans on busking his way through the north of England in the style of an itinerant minstrel—he still thinks of his poems as primarily textual experiences. “By and large, I write for the page, for the inner eye and the inner ear,” he says. And despite the meticulous research that goes into his translations and his collaborations, Armitage is still most fond of his more personal poetry, which he refers to as his “daydream poems.” “They’re the things I want to write for the rest of my life,” he says.Whether collaborating creatively with the disenfranchised or teaching creative writing in universities, Armitage treats his role as a poet as a fundamentally social one. This is partly through necessity—“You can’t make a living as a poet just by writing poems,” he says—but also, it seems, because he has a passion for engaging individuals as well as audiences. Referring to his teaching job, he acknowledges the limitations of education in the creative arts but is adamant about the possibilities. “If they’re not set up for poetry, you can’t change that,” he says, “but what you can do is inspire, motivate, cast a bit of a spell over people.”

One glance at the current display of the photographs at the Art Institute of Boston reveals a decided inconsistency; it is as if the exhibition is shared by two different photographers, with different styles and approaches to conveying emotion in a photograph, rather than being the work of just one artist: Guatemalan Luis Gonzáles Palma.The exhibition, “Hierarchies of Intimacy,” will run through October 25. “Intimacy” is presented as one cohesive collection, but is actually divided between small, sepia-toned images and much larger color digital prints. The Kodalite photographs of the former category, mounted on peeled gold leaf on top of bright red paper, exude a sense of intimacy. In contrast, Palma’s digital photographs feel artificial. The surrealist elements Palma is known for including in his art are integrated well in the Kodalite images, so they do not seem out of place, despite the fact that they are obviously fantastic. The content of the digital photographs, however, seems computer-generated in comparison. As a consequence, Palma’s choice to juxtapose the two dichotomous forms makes for a collection that lacks focus.Palma’s cracked sepia photographs, taken from 2003-2004, evoke antiques recently discovered in a dusty attic. With their appearance of maturity, they recall a time before image-altering software could modify the color, shadow, and even content of a photograph, creating a sense of legitimacy despite the bizarre elements of Palma’s pieces; thus, the floating hands and impossible physics of these photos seem well-integrated into the images.Palma’s use of illusion has an eerie, shocking effect. In “Coagulated love,” a young woman appears contemplative as she stands with her head down, back to the viewer; a severed hand grasps her shoulder, as if it is pressing her into that bowed position. At the entryway of the gallery, Palma states that one of his objectives is to “give a body to ghosts that govern personal relationships.” In this piece, he exemplifies that artistic mission. Though Palma has only depicted an interaction between a hand and the woman, he infuses the photograph with a tension, the implication of an unseen force behind the relationship and an invisible person attached to the hand.Other photographs may not employ surrealism, but still prove evocative; one example, “The light in his eye,” trembles with loneliness. Two empty chairs face each other on a wooden porch, their seemingly hand-stitched seats insinuating that modern society has lost face-to-face communication. The chairs appear to be expecting company or a conversation, but people are nowhere to be seen. This pervasive loneliness lends depth to the photograph and others like it, rendering them poignant yet haunting.People make rare appearances in Palma’s works, but when they do, they often offer the most striking portrayals of hopelessness and loneliness. In the diptych, “The shadows of his youth,” a young man sits at the head of a table, looking solemnly past the viewer. Across the table and physically in the other panel is a blackened human skull donning a birthday party hat. The protagonist’s body, half masked by shadow, seems to refer to the title of the piece; despite the time that has passed, symbolized by the gap between the two panels of the diptych, the man cannot escape the “shadows of his youth.”The contrasting ability of Palma’s earlier and more recent works to convey genuine depth becomes most obvious for those pieces that have similar content, despite being produced at separate times. As in “Coagulated love,” “Variation #2,” a digital photograph, features a hand ominously placed on a woman’s shoulder. However, the composition also includes a man watching the woman from stairs behind her. The attractive models fitted in elegant clothing, the ostentatious chandelier, the immenseness of the print itself, and the light, which illuminates the hallway without reaching the figures, feels superficial and excessive. By abandoning the subtlety of his earlier works, Palma sacrifices the quality of verisimilitude that made his older pieces seem so genuine.Similarly, in “Variation #1,” two chairs face each other, but in this photograph, they sit on a stage. With this setting, the viewer does not feel as if she is intruding on an intimate moment or stumbling into an abandoned room occupied by the subjects, animate or inanimate, of the photograph. Instead, like a bad actor, these more recent images fail to give a convincing performance, and this apparent falseness also keeps Palma’s intended deeper meaning from captivating the viewer. In these digital photographs, any arms that protrude from a wall or hands that float in reverential pose do not evoke Palma’s “ghosts,” but rather, resemble cheap props.Though Palma attempts to capture and project the emotion of his earlier works on the larger and more modern medium of digital print, he fails to transfer that same intensity. His earlier works are less grand, yet they are ultimately more moving.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the film cut to black at the end of the screening of Israeli filmmaker Avi Mograbi’s “Z32” on Sunday, a perplexed audience waited in quiet anticipation for the director to approach the Harvard Film Archive podium. The group primarily consisted of salt-and-pepper heads and a handful of students with previous ties to the documentary’s subject: the extensive moral strain on an Israeli soldier after his involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But the film did not suggest the outrage one would expect; it instead refused to convey a clear sense of Mograbi’s attitude toward the conflict, whether he found the soldier’s war crimes deplorable or forgivable. This was not propaganda; it was provocation.Two days later, the arts and political world crossed paths on a national level. News hit the blogosphere about a conference call in August arranged by the White House and National Endowment for the Arts with a few dozen artists. Those who saw the meeting as a step toward a full Obama-administration takeover of an organization meant to uphold artistic integrity, a veritable propaganda machine for the president, cried “fascism.” In a statement, NEA Chairman Rocco Landesman responded, claiming that the “call was not a means to promote any legislative agenda and any suggestions to that end are simply false,” further ensuring that the call was “completely unrelated to NEA’s grant making, which is highly regarded for its independence and integrity.” But despite varying opinions on the character of the call—one ABC News commentator said that he wasn’t “sure how many laws that breaks, but I’m sure there are some”—the message that art and artists can be a powerful tool in influencing public political opinion came through loud and clear. Harvard made much the same statement last December, when President Drew Faust announced the release of the long-awaited Report of the Harvard Task Force on the Arts. “[W]e have, in relation to the arts, failed to foster a sense of urgency,” the Report said. “What is missing—what the university has yet sufficiently to recognize and to broadcast—is a sense that the arts matter, and not just for one’s private pleasure, but for one’s public person and career.” As the University actively works to incorporate the arts into the education of its students both in and out of the classroom, politically-minded artwork has been appearing more frequently around campus. This past week alone featured a film on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an exhibition on Darfur, and ACT UP New York, an exhibition of over 70 politically-charged posters and visual media from AIDS activism, is slotted for mid-October.As social and political issues heat up domestically and abroad, the need to get creative about informing Harvard students, and the greater public is becoming even more urgent.RAISING QUESTIONSWhen the Task Force outlined its recommendations for integrating the arts and education, it stressed the actual utility of creative pursuits, not simply the importance of aesthetic appreciation. Departments throughout the university are seeking to negotiate this line between artistic value and social resonance, though often placing greater emphasis on one aspect than the other. For the HFA, while the main objective is to exhibit films that are visually challenging, the content’s sophistication is also taken into consideration.“We tend to avoid showing films whose main objective is to deliver information, to deliver an ideological message,” says programmer David Pendleton of the HFA, “because we try to show films that have a certain aesthetic complexity.” This stylistic complexity can contribute to a film’s overall intricacy, as in the case of “Z32,” where the weighty conversation between the Isreali solider and his girlfriend is interspersed with Mograbi singing Grecian chorus style. The director effectively confounds the gravity of his subject matter with the frivolity of song, a component that offended Palestinian audiences when it was screened in the West Bank. But whether Mograbi’s work is sympathetic to the manipulation of the Israel Defense Forces, implicitly drawing the audience into a mass protection of the soldier’s war crimes, or seriously questioning the tactics of the Israeli army, the point is, it triggers a consideration of these topics. “Artists always have their own point of view and angles,” says the Consul General of Israel to New England, Nadav Tamir, who co-sponsored the screening at the HFA. “You can’t ask them to speak for a national narrative. It’s always their story. And they play an important role in society in raising questions.” Using art to foster debate has been an approach that some Harvard departments have employed in service of veritas. For Paul Beran at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard, whose primary focus is academic rather than aesthetic, art is used to stimulate such discussion out of which academic truth can emerge. “It’s not at all about balance,” he says, referring to an equal presentation of two contrasting sides of an argument. “I think balance is used to pigeonhole stuff; I think it’s about understanding.” But this thoughtfulness does not have to promote a particular agenda.“For me, what separates propaganda from art is not the place from which the art comes, but are they approaching it from a place that is academically rigorous,” Beran says. “Are they asking good questions?”STUDENTS TAKING ACTIONBrightly-clad figures hang in photos on the wall near the Tsai Auditorium in the Center for Government and International Studies. Sudanese refugees invite passers-by to enter their camps through photos, taken by Mia Farrow and Brian Steidle among others. The photographs—which will be moved later today—were first exhibited at the Democratic National Convention, but with the help of the Massachusetts Coalition to Save Darfur, the Harvard Darfur Action Group has brought this small sampling to campus in an effort to inspire interest in their cause. Trevor J. Bakker ’10, one of the co-presidents of HDAG, hopes that the exhibition—which also includes paintings by Sudanese artists—will remind students on campus of a conflict in a faraway section of the world. To this end, the art is largely accessible; the photographs play with identifiable imagery, capitalizing on something that one may have once seen or felt. “[This art] may reference things that people have already seen but try not to think about or just haven’t thought about in a while,” Bakker says. “I think when you see the image of the burning village in one of those photos, I think that’s probably an image that many people saw back in 2004 or 2005, so that’s a reference point.” The idea for bringing the exhibition to campus had been in the works since last year, shortly after the release of the Task Force Report, which helped the group get the ball rolling.“We looked to the report of the Task Force on the Arts that was released because we felt that arts do have an important role to play in student’s education at Harvard,” Bakker says. “And in this case outside of the classroom…. “ GROWING PAINTS“It’s almost like puberty for the arts at Harvard.” Daniel R. Pecci ’09 served as an undergraduate on the Arts Task Force and now works as the Program Associate for the American Reparatory Theatre’s Club Oberon. He’s moved from one side of the fence to the other; it’s now his job to implement many of the recommendations that he helped to create. In a way, it’s kind of like puberty for Dan too.For the A.R.T., this means drawing more students to the theatre with more interactive, interesting works, such as this season’s inaugural performance, “The Donkey Show.” “I’ve never seen so many young people worried that they won’t get into a show,” Pecci says of the disco-club remake of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Though last week the Oberon featured “Water Board: A Play About Torture,” there’s still a long way to go before there will be students lining up outside to see a show about political misdeeds. The Arts Task Force’s statement is only the first step.  The Task Force Report gave HDAG the “confidence to go ahead with [the exhibition]: applying for funding, looking for spaces…knowing that this was something the University had made a priority, bringing the arts to Harvard.” It is really through this kind of symbolism that the Task Force itself, according to Pecci, has made the most impact.“I feel like that sort of ignited this fire now,” he says. “An excitement.”“Today, more than ever,” the Report declared, “artistic practice will need to contribute to intellectual inquiry and help construct new forms of social practice.”Getting to this point will require a greater interest in the arts that encourages involvement in social causes, a tough feat for the smaller student groups that are often behind such efforts. In the end, for both art and social interests, infrastructure and hanging frames are not as important as people power.“[W]e can’t be with rose covered glasses about what art and film and photography can actually do,” Professor Tamara Kay of the Sociology department said during the HDAG reception. “In thinking about the limitations and strengths, its actually very hard to measure the impact of an image.”—Staff writer Beryl C.D.

Last year, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals explored the world of ancient Greece with its 161st show, “Acropolis Now,” a comical look at the first Olympics. For its 162nd production, HPT is transporting audiences back to another Greece—“Grease” of the 1950s—with its upcoming show, “Commie Dearest.”Written by Alexandra A. Petri ’10 and Megan L. Amram ’10—the team that also penned “Acropolis Now”—“Commie Dearest” features the Cold War, Communism, climate change, racism, and even potatoes. “It’s about Communists and ‘Grease’ and aliens,” Amram says. “A time when men were men, women were men in drag, and illegal aliens were from space.”Opening at the New College Theatre on February 5, 2010, “Commie Dearest” includes such characters as 50s housewife and witch Sadie Magicword, Cuban diner owner Desi Speakenglish, half-fish Marlin Monroe, and gay ballplayer Doug Out—all acted by men, as per HPT tradition. The villains of the show, Communist sympathizer Pink Lady Bobbie Sox and nefarious Communist potato Spud Nick, devise a plan to freeze the world. The co-writers are working tirelessly to ensure that “Commie Dearest” is a strong follow up effort. “It’s like if we were producing our second child. It’s different and a new one, but we’re going to love it as much as our first child,” Petri says. “We don’t want to rest on our laurels.”“What’s different is there are no jokes this year,” Amram says. “We ran out of jokes. It’s actually a tender family drama. It’s like ‘Roots.’” “We’re both gayer now,” Petri adds.According to Amram and Petri, it is rare that the same writing team has the opportunity to create the show two years in a row, a phenomenon made even more meaningful because last year’s production was the first to be written entirely by women. “The Pudding has been so receptive of this script written by two women,” Amram says. “To think a hundred years ago, we would have been in Radcliffe Yard, needle-pointing a script.”Despite their work last year, Amram and Petri still had to complete the script comp required of all potential HPT writers in order to narrow the field of applicants to the final individuals chosen. Their prior experience undoubtedly helped the duo secure their positions again, but Amram credits another unlikely resource that might have been of assistance. “We thought of the name of the show early on,” she says. “The favorite movie of all time of Cliff Murray [Clifford N. Murray ’10], the president of the Pudding, is ‘Mommie Dearest.’ We thought if we used it we would automatically finish the script comp. And we did.”Once Amram and Petri were chosen to write the script, they sat down with Tony Parise, who has been the Pudding’s professional director since 1996, to identify those characters who would survive to be in the production. They then held a marathon meeting early in the fall to conceive the entire plot and structure. Now the two are working on their fourth draft.“Over J-term, writing will really kick into high gear,” Amram says. “That’s when rehearsals start. It’s a totally delirious time, and we’re changing it up until, like, the day it opens. The plot won’t be decided until two days before opening night.”“We’re not kidding,” she says. “We’re still editing 161.”“They tell us this is how they make real Broadway shows,” Petri continues. Not all material survives the many drafts. “Truman Kaput was a ghost writer—like, an actual ‘ghost’ writer—who did not make it into the show,” Petri says. “We had to ritualistically murder him. He would probably be my favorite child I didn’t actually have.”Another sacrifice in the script purge was a song performed by Communist potato Spud Nick. “I wanted the potato to sing a beautiful ballad called ‘The Vegetable Medley,’” Amram says. “It might still. But it probably won’t.”Among those jokes that have found their way into the script, the writers’ current favorite involves General Dwight Supremacy, who hangs signs reading “Dwights Only” on everything. “Dwight Supremacy is how we skirt around the racism issue,” Amram says. “He wants segregation between Dwights and everyone else.”“People named Dwight are better than other people,” Petri adds.The writing process has been smooth for roommates Amram and Petri, who first collaborated on “Ask Me Anything,” the 2010 Freshman Musical for which Petri wrote the libretto and Amram provided lyrics. This same division of roles has continued for “Acropolis Now” and “Commie Dearest.” However, the two consider all elements of the script together. “I’ve talked to Alex more than I’ve talked to some of my close genetic family members,” Amram says. “We got it last year, and we get it this year. We both really care a lot about what happens, and we haven’t had our big falling out yet. It’s going to happen circa 2024.”“We’re going to be at the opening of ‘Product Placement: The Musical,’ and I’ll storm on stage and throw something, and that something will be Mamram,” Petri says.If comedy writing doesn’t work out for the duo, there are always other avenues to pursue. “I’m actually a computer science concentrator,” Petri says. “They told me to write scripts, and I got confused.”—Staff writer Ali R.

Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Timothy P. Murray announced Wednesday that the State has finalized an agreement to relocate railroad company CSX Transportation’s operations out of Allston—a move that helps pave the way for Harvard to consider long-term development of the many acres of land that the University owns in the area.
Harvard has held land occupied by CSX since 2000, when it purchased 47 acres of land adjacent to the Charles River and in between Harvard and Boston University from the Mass. Turnpike Authority. Three years later, it acquired another 91 acres directly south of that parcel. 
But those land holdings—blanketed with tangles of railroad tracks and sliced by the Mass. Turnpike—cannot currently be used by the University because of CSX’s long-standing easements, which restrict the land’s use to railroad operations.
And even this week’s announcement does not give Harvard the ability to develop, as its contracts stipulate that the State maintains the easements if CSX relocates. Harvard will still have to petition the State for development rights.
Because of these hurdles, Harvard refrained from including the 91-acre-parcel—referred to as Allston Landing South—in its 2007 draft Institutional Master Plan, which outlines the University’s development goals for the next 50 years. Portions of the smaller 47-acre-parcel—known as Allston Landing North—were slated for development during later phases of the timeline.
Harvard spokeswoman Lauren Marshall emphasized that the state’s latest announcement “changes very little regarding the state of Harvard’s property at the moment” and that it would be “premature” to begin planning in Allston Landing South, where CSX operates its Beacon Park railyard. But she noted that discussions with the State and CSX “provide optimism that...opportunities for regional economic benefit from this property are closer to a reality.”
Marshall also said that discussions between Harvard, the State, and CSX over the past few years have yielded a “roadmap” outlining conditions that would have to be met before CSX can fully remove its operations from the area and transfer its land holdings to Harvard, including environmental testing and “other important due diligence benchmarks.” 
CSX’s Beacon Park railyard has long served as one of the primary and largest entry points for freight shipping to New England. Under Wednesday’s agreement, which reportedly is to be implemented over the next few years, the State will pay $100 million to CSX to take over various railroad tracks and railyards, including those in Allston. The acquisitions are expected to improve and expand commuter rail service in and around Boston. 
Jessica Shumaker, a spokeswoman for the Boston Redevelopment Authority, which oversees planning and development in Boston, said that the agreement may help the City develop its proposed rapid-transit Urban Ring around Boston and provide rail service to Allston-Brighton residents.
Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association, said it was important to relocate CSX’s operations carefully because switching to less-strategic shipping routes could raise the cost of goods throughout the region. But he praised the agreement and said it would be nice to get the “dirty old railroad out of our neighborhood.” 
“That much land, that close to the City—it always seemed like there was a higher use for it,” Berkeley said.

Eschewing her customary welcome back e-mail, Faust defined Harvard’s direction for the upcoming year in person yesterday—a renewed call for efficiency and cooperation across the University after a year marked by financial turmoil.“We need to move—promptly but thoughtfully—to what others have called ‘a new normal,’” Faust said, warning an audience that filled just over half of Sanders Theatre that the financial situation would not “simply bounce back to where it was.”Citing inefficiencies in the University’s library systems and IT infrastructure as examples, Faust said that efforts to consolidate would not only save money, but would also improve the quality of these services.Faust pointed to another instance in which the University was able to squeeze savings by centralizing office supply purchases and printing orders: the subtle differences in ink choice on the Veritas shield featured on Harvard employees’ business cards.“The shade of crimson is far less important than the fact that it is Crimson,” Faust said, breaking into a smile as she played up the symbolism in her example. “When each of us has discretion to decide which of 30 different shades of Crimson to put on our business cards, we’ve carried things too far.” Harvard’s endowment investments fell 27.3 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, bringing its total value down to $26 billion—an $11 billion drop. Faust reminded audience members that payout from the endowment will decline by 8 percent in dollar value for at least this year and the next.Harvard’s other two income streams—tuition and fundraising—also shrank, with gift receipts down 8 percent.Over the past year, massive budget cuts across the board resulted in slowed faculty hiring, 275 layoffs, early retirement incentives, as well as a slowdown in Allston construction. Capital spending is expected to decrease by roughly 50 percent, Faust said, to keep spending in line with the University’s new fiscal constraints.In contrast to the bleak financial picture Faust detailed, the event ended on a relatively positive note, with Faust pointing to examples of cross-school academic initiatives, such as a recent push for global health programs.“The larger point is this,” Faust concluded. “Whether our endowment is $37 billion or $26 billion, there is a wealth of intellectual opportunity within this University.”  Though audience response was overwhelmingly positive, praising Faust for her clarity, transparency, and willingness to engage the community, some grumbled that there remain many unanswered questions.Computer Science Professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 pulled out a list that he jotted down during Faust’s speech numbering issues that have yet to be addressed, including faculty and administrator staffing levels across the University.“There’s no sense of academic direction,” Lewis said. “We’re told to contract, but we haven’t heard anyone say broadly what areas or departments need to be contracted more.” —Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Undergraduate Council opens its first session of the year this Sunday, representatives will find themselves operating in a new landscape.The UC enters the 2009-2010 school year with 16 additional members, three additional committees, and a new working relationship with the College administration.Most representatives say the changes in the UC, which stem from the recommendations of last March’s Dowling Report, will increase both the scope and efficiency of the UC. Although some members say they are disappointed by the extent of the changes to the College administration, which fell short of some of the overhauls proposed by Dowling, UC President Andrea R. Flores ‘10 says she believes the reforms will move the UC and the administration in the right direction.“We’re not going to ask them to do the exact things in Dowling,” she says. “There have been basic improvements.”INTERNAL REFORMIn May, the UC passed the UC Reform Act, which amended its constitution to incorporate many of the changes recommended by the Dowling Report, a document that proposed suggestions to improve and empower the Council.The act increased the number of representatives per district from two to three, increasing the Council’s size from 35 representatives to 51.It also increased the number of standing committees from two­ to five. The Finance Committee was retained, and the Student Affairs Committee was split into the Student Life Committee and the Education Committee.According to Mather representative Eric N. Hysen ’11, the additional members and committees will help the UC address a wider range of issues, which have historically taken a backseat to bigger student life concerns.The UC also included additional reforms of its own in the act, including the establishment of the Student Relations Committee and the Student Initiatives Committee. “Our [Student Relations] Committee is going to be a well-oiled machine,” Flores says.Lastly, the act increased the tenure of committee chairs from one semester to a year in order to avoid inefficiencies caused by leadership turnover, and allowed representatives to serve on two committees simultaneously.GREATER ‘PARALLELISM’The Dowling Report dealt not only with UC internal reforms, but also included recommendations for changes in the College governance structure as it interacts with the UC.It recommended three student-faculty advisory committees—College and Residential Life, Undergraduate Education, and Student Services—each of which would be chaired by a Dean and correspond to a UC committee.“By and large, [Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith and Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds] liked the recommendations,” said Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin II.He said that in response to the report, the College plans to merge the student-faculty committees on House Life and College Life, whose jurisdiction often overlapped, into the Committee on Student Life.“There is a parallelism there,” said Hysen, who is also on The Crimson’s IT board, of the new structure. “There are nice lines between the UC’s committees, the student-faculty committees, and the College offices...that was one of the big goals of the Dowling Report.”The report also recommended that the student-faculty committees be given decision-making power. Decisions could be vetoed by the committee chair, who in turn could be overruled by a two-thirds vote.Hammonds and Smith disagreed with this particular suggestion. Smith wrote in a letter to Dowling Committee chair Professor John E. Dowling in May, “I would like to clarify...that the role of committees is to provide recommendations to the deans, who then make decisions with the benefit of those recommendations.”Some students were unsatisfied by degree of change in the College administration.“It’s important that the administration works to implement...provisions of really allowing students and student-faculty [committees] to be decision-making bodies,” said former representative Eric L. Michel ‘12, who is also a Crimson’s sports writer.“The UC restructures itself every four years because its not really getting at the heart of the issue, which is the student-faculty committees. Their jurisdiction has been circumvented...by an explosion of deans,” said former UC Treasurer Anthony R. Britt ’10. “I hope that [the UC] continues to push for that.”A NEW DEALOne area of improvement, according to Flores, is the institutionalization of communication.In previous years, UC leadership met with administrators on an issue-by-issue basis, which became “problematic” last semester, Flores said.Under the new communication structure agreed upon over the summer, Flores—and UC Presidents in the future—will meet weekly with the Assistant Dean of Student Life, Susan B. Marine, biweekly with Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, monthly with Dean Smith, bimonthly with Dean Hammonds, and semesterly with University President Drew G. Faust.“[We should] always get face time, always have a regular spot in University Hall, a regular spot on their schedules,” Flores said. “This will keep us from getting filled in after the fact.”Over the summer, the College also appointed Marine as the official College liaison and adviser to the UC. According to Marine, the de facto relationship between the UC and College administrators has been formalized with her official role as advisor and liaison.“I will be accountable to making sure that I hear from them and bring their concerns forwards and upwards,” Marine said. McLoughlin said that there is now a clear and established framework for communication between the administration and successive UC leadership.“I believe we have a great working relationship right now, and [I] hope that continues,” he said.—Staff writer Melody Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As H1N1 continues to spread on campus, Harvard researchers have taken on important roles shaping the response to the swine flu outbreak that continues to capture national headlines.
Researchers like Marc Lipsitch at the School of Public Health are estimating that, for all the hysteria surrounding the illness, this season’s death rate from H1N1 may not differ substantially from that of a moderate seasonal flu epidemic.
Lipsitch, an epidemiology professor, currently leads a team of biostatisticians, research scientists, and doctors who have spent the last five months estimating the transmissibility and severity of the virus.
But with the peak of flu season fast approaching, such predictions will soon be put to test.
“The role of the predictive research I am doing is coming to an end, as we approach a big wave of flu,” Lipsitch says. “The most important task now is to get drugs out to people who need them.”
And with a mild outcome far from a lock, a slew of other researchers with Harvard ties are investigating the vaccines and viral pathology necessary to combat the virus if outbreaks balloon into an epidemic and grappling with the question of how government leaders should handle the worst-case scenario.
AT THE CENTER
The newly established Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics—where Lipsitch conducts much of his research—currently has 14 ongoing projects related to the H1N1 virus. Funded through the MIDAS program—an NIH initiative to gather information about how diseases spread—the center will receive more than $15 million over the next five years and has become hub of Harvard research on the disease. 
Research Assistant Justin J. O’Hagan, who has worked on several studies with Lipsitch, says that the Center will support a “critical mass of researchers” through collaborations with Harvard specialists as well as international scientists, journalists, and public policy experts.
The Center focuses on research involving methods of disease surveillance, statistical analysis of infectious disease data, and analysis of infectious disease policy, according to Lipsitch. 
“We have been trying to do a lot of things at once since the outbreak of H1N1,” Lipsitch says. “Two of the most important tasks are estimating the transmissibility and the severity of the virus.”
INITIAL PROJECTIONS
When swine flu first appeared in Mexico in the spring, it seemed that the cases were more severe than those reported in the United States, O’Hagan explains. In a study led by Lipsitch, researchers performed “disease surveillance” to determine the severity of the flu and see if the strain was similar in both Mexico and the United States. 
“In the beginning, there is very much a scrambling for data,” says O’Hagan. “Flu in one form or another has been going around for quite some time, but we wanted to know if this was going to be like seasonal flu, or more like the 1918 Spanish Influenza.”
The group looked at the number of tourists traveling to Mexico from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, who returned to their home country with swine flu and compared that number to those reported in Mexico. They concluded that Mexico was under-reporting cases and was missing a large portion of the mild cases, largely because such patients rarely seek medical attention.
“Every country has been under-reporting cases throughout the whole epidemic,” O’Hagan says. “In fact, most countries gave up even trying to keep accurate estimates very quickly as the numbers grew rapidly.”
Another of Lipsitch’s team spent the summer examining the transmissibility of the H1N1 virus.
“Depending on the characteristic of the epidemic, it will either die by itself, we can control it, or it will take over the world and kill us all,” says HSPH Professor of Statistical Computing Marcello Pagano. 
Pagano used statistical models to see how the data accrued, and how accurate it was at the time of the outbreak, he explains.
“Given the quality of the data, we can say that this pandemic could be controllable,” Pagano says.
The project was completed during the summer, before the swine flu vaccine was introduced.
“Before vaccines are available you have one set of conditions,” says Pagano, whose initial analysis on the controllability of the flu was shared with the CDC. “Now, the whole complexion will change radically, assuming the vaccine is going to work.”
TRADITIONAL REMEDIES
As treatment centers still wait for the H1N1-specific vaccine, two other recent projects at the center are related to the effect of traditional antiviral flu drugs on high-risk patients, and the transmission of H1N1 within households.
HSPH Research Scientist Edward Goldstein was part of a team that included O’Hagan and Lipsitch, the head of the Center. The group suggested the use of Tamiflu—a common seasonal flu treatment—for high-risk patients, including pregnant women and the elderly. By giving the drugs early-on to individuals with a high risk of complications, the researchers hope to lessen the fatal effects of flu, Goldstein explains. 
A second project examined the transmission of H1N1 within families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The study presented data showing that early administration of Tamiflu was beneficial in lessening the possibility of transmitting disease within families, in addition to lessening flu symptoms, says Goldstein. 
“This study shows the benefit of people seeking medical attention early on,” O’Hagan says, adding that the study has been forwarded to the CDC and is waiting for publication.
PREVENTION AND RESPONSE
While much of the H1N1 research at Harvard is focused in the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, other experts are examining the disease through the lens of their own specialties.
Wayne A. Marasco, a Medical School associate professor who also holds a post at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, has been researching the factors that may influence an individual to produce antibodies for swine flu and other influenza viruses.
“Because the virus keeps changing its code protein, each season there is a different strain that people need to get vaccinated against,” says Marasco, whose research is still ongoing. “We are seeing if it is possible to create lifelong immunity depending on the genetic makeup of an individual.”
In addition to research on the ground level, a collaboration between HSPH, the Harvard Kennedy School, the CDC, and the U.S. government, is working on ways to train leaders in crisis management and leadership responsibilities—from dealing with terrorist attacks to natural disasters.
Co-Director of the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative Leonard Marcus has been meeting with both health policy experts and White House representatives on how to cope with crisis.
“Bad leadership is a public health risk factor,” says Marcus, who met with leaders at the CDC in Atlanta during the first hours of the swine flu crisis. “The US is on a steep learning curve on how to respond to crises.”
“We give an opportunity for leaders to make good decisions based on science,” he says.
’TIS THE SEASON
As the flu hits the Harvard campus this fall, Medical School Professor and Editor-in-Chief of Harvard Health Publications Anthony L. Komaroff has been involved in public outreach, including creating videos to show people how to protect their families from swine flu. 
“I think in the next few weeks we will see some policies issued, and the first swine flu vaccine given as early as October,” he said.
For the Harvard researchers, much of the next few months will be a time of waiting, as they monitor the data of new swine flu cases and see if their hypotheses, which were based on initial research from the summer, were supported. 
“A preliminary look shows that overall, the epidemic is mild and the fatalities are mostly in the high-risk patients,” Goldstein says. “Hopefully it will stay that way.”

Shah can be reached at hshah@fas.harvard.edu.CORRECTIONThe original version of the Sept. 25 news article "Swine Flu Research Takes Hold" incorrectly stated that swine flu fatalities were only in high-risk patients, according to a quote from HSPH Research Scientist Edward Goldstein.

Google Adwords, the popular search company’s flagship advertising arm that matches online advertisers with related websites, is drawing flak from Business School Professor Ben G. Edelman for business practices he says deprive advertisers of basic rights. In a report published last Monday, Edelman outlines what he considers the five basic rights of online advertisers and argues that Google—which commands 72 percent of the online advertising market—systematically violates these rights.In the report, titled “Towards a Bill of Rights for Online Advertisers,” Edelman wrote in support of an advertiser’s right to: “Know where its ads are shown;” “Meaningful itemized billing;” “Use its data as it sees fit;” “Enjoy the fruits of its advertising campaigns;” and “Resolve disputes fairly and transparently.”To Edelman, many of these rights seem obvious, like itemized billing and knowing where ads are placed. Edelman likened the right of “meaningful itemized billing” to the right of a consumer at the supermarket to have a written receipt of exactly what they are being charged.Edelman charges that Google’s practice of not telling advertisers exactly where their ads are shown only serves to protect Google’s monopoly. “If they did share it, [advertisers] might not like everything [they] saw,” he said.The professor’s push for transparency has already garnered support from some in the industry. “Edelman is shining the flashlight on issues that marketers and advertisers should be aware of,” said search engine marketing expert Kevin Lee.But despite his support for Edelman’s guidelines, Lee is uncertain that there’s “immense pressure from advertisers” for change.He said it is unlikely that any immediate change will be seen from Edelman’s proposal because the vast majority of ad disputes come from a small minority of parties.  Harvard undergraduate publication Freeze Magazine has had its own share of problems with Google advertising, according to Windsor G. Hanger ’10, former executive editor of the magazine. She said she remembered having frequent problems with an ad for the University of Phoenix being displayed by Adwords on Freeze’s site, which is geared toward Harvard students. “The University of Phoenix has no benefit from being on our site and the ad’s irrelevance decreased the overall quality our the site,” Hanger said. Because of the irrelevance of Adwords’ placements, Hanger said Freeze stopped using it.For her new online venture Her Campus, Hanger said she plans to use an “old fashioned approach” to find companies looking to advertise on the Internet—by individually soliciting companies.Edelman’s full report is available at  www.benedelman.org/advertisersrights.

Yesterday afternoon, Harvard Hillel had some unusual visitors—guests from South Korea, and a TV camera.Three employees of the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS), South Korea’s leading television station, rolled tape yesterday while students at Hillel talked about their experiences as Americans, as college students, and as Jews.Footage of the round-table discussion will be featured in an upcoming KBS documentary about Jewish life in America.“It’s an extraordinary opportunity to educate quite a lot of people in Korea about Judaism in our own words from our perspective,” said Harvard Hillel Associate Director Michael Simon in an interview before the filming. During the discussion, students sought to explain the role of Judaism in their lives. Some students spoke about Judaism’s spiritual aspects, while others stressed the cultural facet of their tradition.“It’s the foods I eat, the language I read, the words I use at home,” said Reyzl R. Geselowitz ’10.As they tried to define their religion for viewers in Korea, the students at Hillel debated their own ideas of Judaism.“Does being Jewish mean keeping kosher? Does being Jewish mean celebrating Shabbat? Does being Jewish mean feeling proud when I see someone Jewish on TV?” one student queried.For many, the answer was social activism. “To me, it’s all about social justice. It’s about making the world a better place when I leave it than it was when I found it,” said Neil D. Spears, a student in the Graduate School of Education.Lilli R. Margolin ’11, who was adopted from Korea and raised by a Jewish family, said that when she met her birth family, “I don’t think they really comprehended the fact that I’m Jewish. I don’t think it really registered with them that I don’t believe in Jesus.” Korea has a negligible number of Jews, too few to be listed by the CIA World Factbook. In America, Jews make up 1.7 percent of the population according to the CIA, while at Harvard, according to the international Hillel website, about 25 percent of the student body is Jewish.Despite this difference, the filmmakers said that they believe that Jewish students’ experiences will be relevant to Korean audiences. “The Jews are a small minority who have successfully struggled to become a major influence in America,” producers Hyunmo Jung and Sun You said yesterday at Hillel.“We’re trying to understand where you’re from, your struggle, your history,” You told the gathered students. “We’re similar culturally, and maybe Koreans can be inspired by your stories.”

A robotic hand that could clean up messes would be a welcome roommate for any dorm-room dweller. And far from being a pipe-dream, such a hand may soon be on the market, say Harvard researchers.
The new robotic hand comes after years of work by researchers in the lab of Robert D. Howe, a professor of engineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Unlike most robotic hands—which are made of rigid steel—Howe’s SDM Hand is polymer-based and has flexible joints, according to Aaron M. Dollar, who helped develop the technology as a graduate student at Harvard and is now a Yale assistant professor.
“They asked, ‘How can you make the most simple hand possible that will work?’” said Leif P. Jentoft, a graduate student in Howe’s biorobotics lab.
Last week, robotics firm Barrett Technology, Inc. licensed the SDM Hand for an undisclosed sum—drawn by the hope that the hand’s novel structure could find use in a wide variety of applications.
Researchers conceived of the hand in response to a common problem in earlier models. Unlike human hands, the steel versions weren’t able to adapt to unexpected variations in their environments.
Human hands, for example, have little issue adjusting when an object—say, a mug of coffee—turns out to be smaller or in a different location than expected. But a steel hand, because of its rigidity, would likely spill the coffee or even break the mug.
The flexibility of the SDM Hand lets it conform to and grasp objects of different sizes and shapes that may not be in the position predicted—in other words, the environment found outside of the laboratory, added Dollar.
“The net result is something that is very simple but is very robust in different grasping scenarios,” Jentoft said. “As a result, in the real world, when your object isn’t exactly where you expect it to be, the hand can adapt to it and doesn’t end up damaging itself or the object.”
The potential solution has ramifications outside the household as well, since rigid hands used in manufacturing often break whenever they are struck by heavy objects, said Barrett President and CEO William T. Townsend.
Barrett expects the first robotic hands to be available in 2011, and the researchers envision the robotic hand will find uses in the household—such as helping elderly people pick up dropped objects—in prosthetics, and in factories.
“The Harvard hand is a pretty bold new approach to the whole problem,” said Townsend. “It went against everything everyone else was trying to do.”

A recent nation-wide survey by the Harvard School of Public Health found that most businesses believe they will suffer significant operational difficulties in the event of a widespread H1N1 outbreak.
Roughly 56 percent of businesses surveyed believe they would not encounter severe operational problems if 30 percent of their workforce were absent for two weeks, according to the survey conducted by the Harvard Opinion Research Program at HSPH. But when faced with losing half of their workforce for two weeks, only one-third of businesses reported feeling prepared.
“One of the key findings...suggest[s] that businesses are vulnerable, particularly to widespread absenteeism,” said Gillian K. SteelFisher, a research scientist and the assistant director of the research program.
Although 75 percent of American businesses offer paid sick leave for employees, a significantly smaller percentage of businesses provide employees paid leave to take care of sick family members or children when schools or daycares close, according to SteelFisher.
Employees whose jobs do not offer paid leave to care for sick family and children may face “serious morale problems on how to cope with financial issues,” said Robert J. Blendon, director of the research program and a professor of health policy and political analysis at the School of Public Health.
The survey also found that almost half of businesses providing paid sick leave require employees to present physician notes, a proportion Blendon finds troubling.
“Doctors would have difficulty caring for actual sick people if their offices are swamped by hundreds of people waiting in line for a sick note,” he said.
Though Blendon acknowledged that businesses are facing an economic recession, he emphasized the importance of preparing for the flu season in advance.
“It is critical that businesses review their policies in case of an epidemic,” Blendon said.
“There is a share of businesses worrying about such issues now, and hopefully the results of this survey will provide an impetus for others,” he added.
The survey of 1,057 randomly selected businesses nationwide was conducted by SSRS/ICR—an independent research company. It was the fourth in an ongoing series of inquiries into the effects of H1N1 flu in America and was the first of those to focus on the flu’s potential impact on businesses.
The surveys are funded by a cooperative agreement between HSPH, the Centers for Disease Control, and the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative.

While most students are familiar with flax in the context of breakfast cereals, the fibrous plant transcended its crunchy, delicious role to provide Harvard archaeologist Ofer Bar-Yosef with some surprisingly ground-breaking findings. 
An archaeological expedition funded by the American School of Prehistoric Research at Harvard’s Peabody Museum resulted in the discovery of the oldest fibers known to have been used by humans—a finding that helps date the rise of civilization due to the importance of string in the origins of human culture.
The fibers were discovered in the Republic of Georgia by a team of archaeologists, including Bar-Yosef, a professor of prehistoric archaeology, and archaeologists from universities in Israel and the Republic of Georgia.
The team’s findings, published in the Sept. 11 issue of Science, indicate that the fibers are at least 34,000 years old. The earliest-known fibers before the discovery, found at the Dolni Vestonice site in the Czech Republic, date to 30,000 years ago.
According to Bar-Yosef, the discovery was “accidental.” When team member Eliso V. Kvavadze of the Institute of Paleobiology at the National Museum of Georgia analyzed the pollen content in soil samples to determine the change in climate over time, she came upon what appeared to be fiber fragments.
These fragments were later identified as flax fibers. This flax would have been gathered from the environment, most likely by women, according to Bar-Yosef. Flax was not domesticated until the Neolithic era thousands of years later, he added.
Some of the fibers found were spun, twisted, or knotted, and many appear to have been dyed, said Bar-Yosef. Though only small fragments of fibers were found at the dig site, archaeologists “can infer from looking at these kinds of fibers that they were making strings [and] ropes,” said Bar-Yosef. The strings and ropes could then be used to “serve as baskets [or] carrying equipment” or to tie fur clothing together.
According to Naomi F. Miller, an anthropologist and research project manager at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, “string and twine are very important for the development of human culture,” making this a “remarkable discovery.”
In addition to the flax fibers, the team discovered other particles such as insect remains and fungi that would indicate that textiles were once present in the area, Bar-Yosef said.For recent research, faculty profiles, and a look at the issues facing Harvard scientists, check out The Crimson's science page.

CORRECTION APPENDEDA common sexually transmitted disease thought to have virtually no visible symptoms in men may actually be putting men at risk for advanced prostate cancer, according to a Harvard study released earlier this month. Researchers followed two groups of men suffering from prostate cancer—one with the sexually transmitted  infection Trichomoniasis, caused by a parasite—and found that the group suffering from the infection developed more likely to suffer from more severe forms of cancer. According to the study, at least 174 million people worldwide suffer from Trichomoniasis. And though the disease is treatable with antibiotics, its relatively silent nature in males complicates efforts at treatment.  Because Trichomoniasis usually affects women, men are often unaware of their condition. Many men only realize that they have the infection when their female partner is diagnosed—a troubling prospect if the link with severity of prostate cancer proves causal. “Prostate cancer is the most common cause of cancer among men in westernized countries,” said Jennifer Stark, the study’s lead author and a 2008 graduate from the School of Public Health. “It’s also the second leading cause of cancer-related death; it’s a big public health problem.” Although most men with prostate cancer have good outcomes, Stark stressed that the link they found for Trichomoniasis was with particularly advanced forms of prostate cancer, making the finding of potentially high importance for efforts to combat prostate cancer deaths. “What we really want to do is find how we can prevent aggressive prostate cancer from happening,” said Lorelei A. Mucci, a School of Public Health assistant professor and the study’s senior author. The study built on research released last year that suggested a link between the infection and prostate cancer, but the new study included more subjects with advanced forms of cancer. There had only been two other studies on Trichomonas Vaginalis, the parasite that causes the infection, and neither had had enough advanced-state prostate cancer cases or long-term follow up to draw conclusions from mortality rates, Mucci said. Further research will be necessary before researchers can conclude that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two conditions.  “We have not shown that Trichomonas Vaginalis causes prostate cancer at all,” Stark said. “In order to make that giant leap from our study to something that would demonstrate causation...we need to show that being infected with TV leads to changes in the prostate,” she added.CORRECTIONAn earlier version of the Sept. 25 news article "STD Linked to Prostate Cancer" misspelled the last name of the lead author of the study. Her name is Jennifer Stark, not Jennifer Star.For recent research, faculty profiles, and a look at the issues facing Harvard scientists, check out The Crimson's science page.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced Friday the appointment of State of Massachusetts finance official Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 to the post of FAS dean for administration and finance, effective Nov. 2.In an e-mail announcement, Smith prominently referred to Kirwan's "strong background" in financial management, including a two-year stint as secretary of administration and finance for the commonwealth of Massachusetts, as a crucial quality she brings to her post in an FAS now facing a $110 million deficit.As the secretary of administration and finance under Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, Kirwan was responsible for developing the state capital budget and overseeing budgetary activities across the state government, according to Friday's announcement sent to FAS faculty and staff.Kirwan took the helm of the Massachusetts state budget when it was in crisis. She has helped Patrick close a series of daunting deficits in the past two years, including a $1.4 billion shortfall in October and another $1.1 billion deficit in January, according to the Boston Globe.“Leslie will lead our administrative functions and will be a key member of the University-wide administrative team,” Smith wrote in the announcement. “Working closely with the academic deans, she will also help me continue to address the unprecedented financial challenges.”The appointment follows news in July that then-FAS dean for administration and finance Brett C. Sweet would leave for Vanderbilt after less than a year at Harvard.Until a replacement could be found, Catherine Gorodentsev—formerly the executive vice president’s chief of staff—assumed the interim role of FAS dean for administration, and Deena Giancotti—associate dean for finance—took up Sweet’s financial responsibilities.Kirwan, who graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School in 1984, is not unfamiliar with the terrain of fiscal management and administration, as evinced by her years of service to the state. Prior to her role on the governor’s cabinet, Kirwan spent seven years as director of administration and finance at the Massachusetts Port Authority. She also served as deputy commissioner at the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, which required her to manage the activities of over 2,500 state employees.—Staff writer Bonnie J.

"I wish I were in California" may be a habitual moan on the lips of plenty of students hailing from warmer climes this winter, but this may be the first time where it's fair to say, "At least we're not in California." After all, Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't our governor, Massachusetts' finances aren't on the brink of collapse, and Harvard...well, Harvard is not a state school.
Now, believe it or not, FlyBy doesn't mean that in a snobbish way.  The fact is, California's state schools may be in a heap of trouble. The state legislature approved a whopping 20 percent cut in funding for the 10 schools in the University of California system—shaving $637.1 million from a $3.23 billion budget, which now stands at $2.6 billion. The legislature has also proposed a 32 percent increase in student tuition by fall 2010. In response, students, faculty, and staff protested the cuts yesterday. Imagine choosing Berkeley or UCLA over Harvard or Yale because you thought the tuition was that much lower.
“I chose Berkeley over all the other universities because it offered me a very good education at a price my family could afford,” one freshman political science major, who skipped classes for the day in protest, told The New York Times.
Too bad he can't apply to transfer to Harvard.  More higher ed gloom and doom after the jump.
As it happens, California is poised to cut the UC system's funding even further next year. “We are operating on the assumption that the state’s disinvestment will continue,” Berkeley's Chancellor Robert Birgeneau told The New York Times.
Now look at things from the Cambridge side. The Harvard Corporation—the University's main governing body—does not have to plan for a balanced budget every year, as a state legislature does. So, it has cut funding for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences this year by 8 percent and will cut at least another 8 percent the following year, though FAS Dean Michael D. Smith is expecting 12 percent. If Dean Smith is right, that amounts to a 19 percent cut spread out over two years—not much better than the UC system's 20 percent cut for this year.
But Harvard's tuition has been upped just 3.5 percent (still above the near-zero inflation rate to compensate for higher demand for financial aid), financial aid funding has risen 18 percent, and President Faust and Dean Smith have reaffirmed that financial aid will not take a hit despite greater fiscal constraints.
Still, Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences needs to close its remaining $110 million annual deficit. After staff layoffs, salary freezes, and very slow faculty hiring, where will it cut next?

Right now river house residents can take advantage of the nice weather and go for a run outside, or they can make their way over to the Malkin Athletic Center in their gym shorts. But what will happen when the snow gets too high, the cold too unbearable, and the MAC's 10 p.m. closing time too early? While freshmen have little to turn to besides the Law School's  Hemenway gym, upperclassman can resort to their house gyms. That is, if they can find them.
This is the first of a series of posts showcasing (and judging) Harvard's house gyms. Each gym will receive somewhere between one and five stars. Today, following the jump, we consider everyone's favorite neighborhood: Adams, Lowell, and Quincy.
Adams House Gym (**)
Maybe it is a testament to Flyby's inexperience with the multi-building complex that is Adams House, but finding the house's gym along a subterranean path filled with beautiful murals was nearly impossible. After asking for directions, Flyby finally found the two-room gym, which is in the house's basement nearby the Mt. Auburn Street entrance. While Adams' is the only house reviewed today that split its cardio and weightlifting equipment, the layout failed to give this prison-like gym a sense of space. Instead, it felt hot and cramped.
The equipment in the weightlifting room had no semblance of order or organization. Both rooms had awkward and intruding pipes in the ceiling, making the spaces feel even busier. The gym lacked a television. In Adams' defense, the entire floor was nicely covered with green interlocking mats. The cardio room included three elliptical machines/cross ramps, a treadmill, a bike, an erg (Concept 2), and a stairs machine.
Lowell House Gym (*)
Thank goodness Lowell House residents live so close to the MAC. Their gym is simply underequipped. Most significantly they lack a treadmill and an erg. They don't have a television either. Their gym is in an unlabeled, converted squash court in C entry. They do have three bike machines, but two of them look like they're decades old. There is one elliptical machine/cross ramp, an assortment of dumbbells, two inflated balls for ab exercises and some weightlifting equipment. The gym is small and the floor has a smattering of exercise mats covering it.
To Lowell's credit it does have some quality exercise facilities outside the gym proper which were not included in this assessment. They have a rock climbing room, a basketball hoop in a squash court, and a handful of usable squash courts.
Quincy House Gym (****)
You can take an elevat0r to the Quincy gym. It's one floor below the entrance to the house office and sits next to the Bullitt Room. The room is clearly labeled a "Fitness Center" and requires Quincy swipe access to enter. Inside this very blue, mirror-lined room sit five  elliptical machines/cross ramps, two treadmills, two bikes, well-organized dumbbells, an erg, and one television set in the corner. The room feels much bigger than both Lowell and Adams and had the most cardio equipment of the three. The only thing unbecoming about the Quincy House gym were the random tears in the gym's carpeting.  And that's why it tops today's list, with four stars.
