After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most people, a ticket is a deterrent against illegal parking. But for a rich man, that ticket is merely a fee for a more convenient parking spot.
Like the elite university version of a parking ticket, a bill currently under consideration in the Massachusetts House will require institutions of higher education to pay a fee to continue considering legacy status or donor relationships in the admissions process. For Harvard, this fee would add up to a small 0.2 percent of its endowment, or about $100 million a year.
As a board, we remain resolute in our belief that legacy applicants should not get a leg up in the admissions process. We have applauded peer institutions that have chosen to do away with legacy admissions, and we eagerly await the practice’s demise at Harvard.
However, the Commonwealth’s legislature should not be delivering the death blow to legacy admissions, and certainly not with this bill.
The bill at hand does not outright ban legacy preference in admissions; it only fines schools that decide to continue with the practice. We cannot predict what price tag Harvard and other elite institutions will put on their admissions status quo, but we are unsettled by the idea that colleges can continue to perpetuate inequality for a fee, lining the state government’s treasury in the process. The nature of the fee ironically evokes the same abhorrent cash nexus present in legacy and donor admissions — that you can get into Harvard as long as you have enough money and connections.
We are also deeply perturbed by the proposal’s implementation. While we are not privy to the bill’s granular details, we can only imagine that schools will be forced to hand over their admissions data to the state in order to determine if they are in compliance. We are leery of handing over hordes of sensitive admissions data to a political body that may lack the organizational capacity and expertise to store, protect, and process it.
Instead, we’d rather the federal government take action.
In 2022 alone, more than half of Harvard’s research revenue was sponsored by the federal government, for a total of $642 million. The federal government should leverage the funding it provides institutions such as Harvard to universally mandate the abolition of legacy preferences in admissions. This withdrawal of support would provide much better incentive than Massachusetts’s percentage fee.
Despite our apprehension with this one bill, we do see a role for the Massachusetts government in encouraging Harvard to contribute to the social good of the state. We remain supportive of programs such as the Payment in Lieu of Taxes and continue to call on Harvard to fulfill its PILOT requests. Such a program, with full cooperation from relevant parties, could form the basis for how the state can motivate donations and community outreach from private institutions, especially as they expand across the river.
We are glad that the Massachusetts House is attempting to address the inequalities perpetuated by Harvard and its peers through legacy preferences in admissions. But we can’t support the approach. Taxing immorality is awfully close to profiting from it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one of my professors showed us the term “moral masochism,” I felt like it perfectly encapsulated an ethos I’ve seen at Harvard.
It essentially means feeling superior to others due to self-deprivation or self-sacrifice – which you can sense in comments like “I only slept two hours!” “I pulled three all-nighters writing my thesis!” or my (least) favorite, “I was so busy I forgot to eat!”
I mention this because I want to discuss “doing”: where we want or feel obligated to do so much, until we feel it’s worth more if we suffer. So in a way, these self-satisfactory boasts could be warning signals in this vicious cycle of doing that may land us in burnout —  a state of exhaustion brought on by stress due to work, social or family life, or other areas.
By no means am I the first to write about burnout at a place like this. But as we sprint towards finals and graduation, fitting in as many academic and social obligations as we can, I propose that we should normalize not going to the extreme — even for things and people we care about — if doing so is detrimental to our well-being.
I say this, because folks, I’m burnt out! But I’ve also had so much joy recently: with classes I’m passionate about, extracurriculars I enjoy, and loved ones in my life. How could I be burnt out?
My answer? Burnout seems to be the darker underbelly of FOMO (fear of missing out). And with time here, FOMO lurks under every opportunity to challenge ourselves academically, explore new skills, forge relationships, and gain memorable experiences. And I feel so lucky to have this at my fingertips, and I never regret what I append to my to-do’s — from reading poetry at open mics, to visiting cafes with friends. But positive stressors are still stressors: Even if we forge existences that are maximally fulfilling, if we don’t have room to breathe in between calendar slots, to simmer in our thoughts, to recover our energy, to embrace spontaneity, how can we truly call life fulfilling?
Of course, I’m not saying we shouldn’t do our best, or that we can avoid burnout altogether. You could say burning out is worth what comes later: something I’ve done, in early college years devoted to pre-professional extracurriculars and recruiting to break into tech — now affording me space to write. There are also commitments we hope to honor, like thesis deadlines, or unexpected pivots that offer us a chance to show up: from comforting friends in need, to — for me specifically — agreeing to fill in for a dance performance. Choosing to go beyond often does make sense and yield positive experiences.
Still, I hope we don’t get stuck in this incessant cycle of feeling like we could do more to the extreme; it’s dangerous if we perceive that our value is rooted in what we produce and how visible we are.
I still worry I should do more. Should I have done more research?  Joined more clubs? Spent more time with this senior friend? It’s hard to tackle the notion that I’m not fulfilling my best self by all the things I’ve missed. But while I haven’t achieved full self-acceptance, in my burnt-out, undisclosed-not-feeling-well state, I now know that this cyclic narrative can’t run on forever.
So, if you’re feeling a bit frayed, please try to take a breath. Take a nap. Request that extension. Cancel that hangout. I personally know it can feel radical to care for yourself, especially with mental health struggles. At least for me, I think of the five-minute rule, which describes how just five minutes of work can help us realize work mode isn’t so hard to access – so instead, let us microdose moments of rest and see what life returns to us.
To normalize such acts of self-preservation, we do need to normalize honesty about how we’re doing. But that’s tricky when norms pressure us to stick to the script: from how constant strivings towards achievement equates to worthiness, to how we must appear genuine but collected in front of classmates, even friends.
Moreover, how honest should we be? If we want to protect our privacy, it’s possible others won’t believe cookie-cutter explanations; I think of the “my grandparent died” excuse that professors may not trust, or acquaintances that seem suspicious when I say I need to reschedule. Yet being too honest may risk our semblance of trustworthiness or professionalism; I think of universities forcing college students to leave for serious mental health issues.
While I don’t have the answer, I hope we can start engendering honesty through even small challengings of these norms. For instance, when acquaintances ask “How are you?”, they’re often surprised when I don’t answer affirmatively; in our day-to-day, perhaps we should invite, offer, and expect honesty, to create a more genuinely empathetic culture.
Also, our professors can proactively invite openness and offer flexible policies (which I’m lucky to have had!). And, to be (literally) honest, I decided to be vulnerable about my well-being with friends, project teammates, and Crimson staff, requesting rest, and they’ve all been kind and receptive.
While I still get guilty for not “doing enough” — as a student, friend, what-have-you — I’ve made strides towards my hopes for success and joy. In the same way that we hopefully don’t regret what we choose to do, maybe we shouldn’t regret what we choose not to do either.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, a student climate advocacy organization, released a letter calling on Harvard to select a Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean who will restrict the influence of the fossil fuel industry on academic research.
Current FAS Dean Claudine Gay and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 are two months into the search for the next dean of Harvard’s largest school after the University tapped Gay to become Harvard’s 30th president starting July.
In a letter addressed to Gay and the FAS dean search advisers, Divest Harvard called for the new dean to be “free of personal fossil fuel conflicts of interest,” be “willing and able to enforce existing rules” on transparency in research funding, and “have a plan for phasing out fossil fuel money in the research process.”
Divest Harvard cited a report released in March by left-wing think tank Data for Progress that found that in the past decade, Harvard has received at least $20 million of research funding from fossil fuel companies.
“This doesn’t just put Harvard’s academic mission at risk — it threatens our reputation, too,” the letter stated.
The April letter came after Divest Harvard penned an open letter to Harvard Law School professor Jody L. Freeman criticizing her board position at fossil fuel company ConocoPhillips.
Freeman, the principal investigator of a group investigating tools for corporations to reach net-zero emissions goals, recently received a research grant from Harvard’s Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability and has faced criticism that the role could represent a potential conflict of interest with her climate work.
More stringent rules on funding sources are not unprecedented, Divest Harvard wrote in the letter, pointing to “rigorous public disclosure policies” in place for research at Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health’s decision to not accept funding from the tobacco industry.
Phoebe G. Barr ’23-’24, an organizer with Divest Harvard, said the new FAS dean should consider the climate crisis “one of the most important, if not the most important issues, of our time.”
“Faculty of Arts and Sciences has actually been one of the weakest schools at Harvard in terms of its policies with regard to fossil fuel industry funding and specifically disclosure of that funding,” Barr said.
The letter also pointed to steps that Princeton, Brown, and Oxford have taken to limit climate research funding from the fossil fuel industry.
“Harvard, however, chronically lags its peers in guarding against fossil fuel impingements on the academic process,” the letter reads.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.
Going forward, Barr said she hopes Harvard’s new incoming leadership will listen to Divest Harvard’s perspective.
“We would like for this new president and this new dean to be somebody who’s willing to listen to our concerns and our progress and our goals for improving Harvard,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students flocked to Tercentenary Theatre on a cloudy Sunday afternoon for Yardfest, the College’s annual spring concert for undergraduates.
Singer, songwriter, and producer Jeremih headlined the event, which was sponsored and organized by the Harvard College Events Board. Jeremih performed some of his most popular hits, including “Birthday Sex,” “oui,” and “Don’t Tell ’Em.”
The performance drew mixed reviews from students, with some criticizing the brevity of Jeremih’s appearance.
Student bands Beacon Street and Weld 16 also performed at Yardfest, and producers and DJs Coco & Breezy opened for Jeremih. Both undergraduate groups earned spots as openers by winning the Battle for Yardfest, an annual competition held in Sanders Theatre where student performers vie for the chance to open for the Yardfest headliner.
Claire Wigglesworth ’24 said she had “extremely high expectations” that were not met.
“Jeremih was the headliner, and he was more like Jere-mid to be honest. He was on for an hour, and there was so much build up to this. All of the block parties for the river and for the Quad and to be honest, I was unfulfilled,” she said.
Jeremih did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Habiba Eldefrawy ’25 said because she was not familiar with Jeremih’s music, this year’s installment of Yardfest was “worse” than last year’s.
Kingston H. Herbert ’25 said he thinks the event would benefit from a reallocation of funding for performers, adding that this year’s weather conditions made the event less enjoyable.
“I think they shouldn’t put any money into an opener. I think they should just put all their money into the main event,” he said.
CEB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Freshman John B. Vizhco Leon ’26 said Jeremih’s performance exceeded his expectations, describing the event as “amazing.”
“It was my first Yardfest, and it was something unreal. Being in the middle of the whole crowd was surreal,” he said.
Yardfest festivities began early in the afternoon with drinks, food, and music at block parties in courtyards at Leverett House, Quincy House, and Winthrop House, as well as an event on Quad Lawn.
“It was really nice seeing people from my future house community just vibing together. It was just a fun experience,” Vizhco Leon said.
At his final Yardfest, Quan L. Narula ’23 said he was “pretty hyped” to hear Jeremih — one of his favorite artists “since eighth grade” — perform his favorite songs.
“‘Down On Me’ with 50 Cent is great. ‘Birthday Sex’ is a great song,” Narula said. “Just a lot of solid bangers.”
Despite being unfamiliar with Jeremih’s music, Jessica X. Diao ’26 said she enjoyed the concert.
“Everyone’s in the same place and able to enjoy good music together and good food and being able to see friends,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Washington Bothell Earth Sciences professor Margaret H. Redsteer discussed the role of Indigenous knowledge in climate adaptation during a lecture hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center on Thursday.
Thursday’s talk was the second of two Redsteer delivered last week for the Tanner Lectures on Human Values, a series of lectures administered by the University of Utah that invites scholars from numerous disciplines to discuss human behavior and ethics.
Redsteer’s lecture was followed by a talk by University of Arizona Law professor Rebecca Tsosie. Afterward, Redsteer and Tsosie participated in a question-and-answer session about Indigenous knowledge and United States climate policy.
Redsteer began by discussing current American climate policy, describing the majority of U.S. climate initiatives as focused on “the mainstreaming of climate action,” or adding climate change considerations to existing federal programs.
Redsteer said this approach to climate policy has the drawback of creating a one-sided view of climate impacts.
“Whatever the agency goals are, those are the goals that are being examined,” she said. “This favors those with privileges and connections and ignores the different ways that climate could be experienced.”
Incorporating Indigenous knowledge into climate work provides researchers with a more nuanced understanding of climate change, Redsteer said.
Because Indigenous language and culture are “based on the need to have detailed knowledge about local environments in order to survive,” she said, “Indigenous communities are tuned in to their local changes” in a way that other knowledge systems are not.
Redsteer said the “co-production of knowledge,” where scientists rely on and credit Indigenous knowledge to inform their analysis, has become widespread. She added, though, that scientists often see Indigenous knowledge as just another tool to gather data and plug it into models, instead of considering the unique context of that knowledge.
“I argue these practices, removed from their cultural context, are not traditional knowledge, because the end goal has radically changed to extracting reductionist information for uniform applications,” she said.
Redsteer also said the ways scientists currently gather information may de-emphasize the agency of Indigenous people.
She added that scientists may also perpetuate the “romanticization of Native people” by treating them as “points of data collection” rather than giving them a role in asking scientific questions.
Redsteer said, for example, that climate researchers may collect meteorological data from leased Indigenous lands and fail to provide the data to Native landholders.
In her talk, Tsosie said these issues represent a loss of “data sovereignty,” where external groups commission studies and extract information from Indigenous lands to further their own aims.
To fully augment climate policy, Redsteer said Indigenous knowledge should be used in collaboration with scientific projections, not only as a scientific tool.
Redsteer said climate research in general focuses on “projections of what might happen 30, 50, or 100 years from now” or data from “hundreds of thousands of years ago” — information that is not “easily relatable to current human experiences.”
In contrast, Redsteer said, Indigenous knowledge provides a view of climate change that is much easier to relate to and understand and is more reflective of Indigenous peoples’ experiences.
“Observations from Indigenous peoples’ lands and resources show a vast array of climate impacts and living conditions,” Redsteer said, adding that Indigenous findings can make climate research more accessible.
Redsteer closed by reiterating the importance of traditional knowledge.
“These observations are a significant contribution to understanding our world today,” she said.

Harvard junior Travis Allen Johnson ’24 was awarded the Harry S. Truman Scholarship, an award dedicated to inspiring and supporting Americans from diverse backgrounds to public service, according to a Wednesday press release.
According to the scholarship’s website, Johnson will be awarded up to $30,000 in funding for postgraduate studies, along with leadership training, career counseling, and special employment opportunities within the federal government. Aside from Johnson, 61 other students across the U.S. were also awarded the honor for 2023.
Johnson, a Government concentrator in Winthrop House, said he has long been inspired to seek the scholarship and a law degree in order to address discrimination in the legal system.
“I come from a place where so many members of my community are marginalized, and I’ve seen the impacts of the criminal legal system and how that is targeted at low-income Black individuals,” said Johnson. “For me, it’s always been about trying to use my education to help combat that.”
Johnson served alongside LyLena D. Estabine ’24 as inaugural co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Association — Harvard’s newly formed student government body — a position he credits with granting him a unique perspective on leadership and perseverance.
“I think as a result of my time co-leading the HUA in its infancy, it really allowed me to understand the ins and outs of leadership — the complexities of leadership — but also the way in which good leadership can result in incredible things happening,” Johnson said.
Johnson said he was eating dinner with Estabine when he got the call that he had been selected for the honor. He subsequently received congratulatory emails from University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
“I was just so excited — super excited — because this is really something that I care a lot about,” Johnson said.
Though Johnson said the application process included “by far the most difficult interview” he’s been through, he credited his previous work experiences at the Democratic National Committee and multinational law firm Latham and Watkins for broadening his horizons and strengthening his appeal as a candidate.
“I was also able to use that as an opportunity to say, ‘There are so many incredibly talented lawyers who go to big law rather than using their time and efforts to help marginalized individuals,’” Johnson said of his experience at Lathem and Watkins.
“I respect that choice, but it also instilled in me a desire to not want to do that — instilled in me a desire to want to go back to the local level and start as a lawyer there,” he added.
Moving forward, Johnson said he hopes his achievements can serve to inspire others with backgrounds similar to his.
“People don’t associate my town with great things, and so I do hope that me winning and being awarded the Truman Scholarship can show other like-minded individuals that it’s not about where you come from,” Johnson said. “You can really achieve great things, and the only limitations are the ones you place on yourself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow urged fellow university presidents to demand immigration reform during a Friday speech at the American Council on Education’s annual gathering.
Bacow, an outgoing board member of ACE, also received a lifetime achievement award from the organization prior to delivering his remarks during a keynote event on the second day of the conference.
Standing in front of a podium at the Marriott Marquis hotel, less than one mile from the White House, Bacow decried the “deeply disturbing” sense of “paralysis in our capital around issues of immigration.”
“Unfortunately, at this point, in determining who was worthy of entrance into this country, the U.S. seems to increasingly prefer or give preference to those who speak English, those who come with highly valued demonstrable skills, and those who come with sufficient resources to ensure that they never become wards of the state,” he said.
Bacow stressed that institutions of higher education depend on immigration.
“We limit immigration, I believe, at our peril,” Bacow said. “Why? Because first of all, immigration furthers our national interest, but perhaps even more importantly, immigration defines our national identity.”
Bacow pointed to his own identity as the son of Jewish refugees who arrived in the U.S. without demonstrable skills, resources, or fluency in English, “as living proof that what we do — that education — has the capacity to transform lives.”
“Where else can you go literally in one generation from off the boat with nothing — my mother’s 20 years old when she gets here, one suitcase — to grow up and have the kind of life and opportunity that I have enjoyed?” Bacow added. “Immigration made my life possible.”
In his speech, Bacow also touted some of his proudest accomplishments as president of the University, discussing Harvard’s support for a Palestinian student who was initially deported by U.S. immigration authorities upon his arrival in the country to start college.
He also pointed to the joint lawsuit filed by Harvard and MIT against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement over their decision to expel international students during the Covid-19 pandemic — which led to DHS and ICE to rescind the order.
Bacow, however, insisted that these victories were not achieved on their own.
“I always say that no individual accomplishes anything on their own — and it’s true about institutions as well,” he said. “We were backed in this effort by ACE, we were backed in this effort by all the higher education associations, we were backed in this effort by countless colleges and universities.”
In highlighting the accomplishments of the University under his tenure as president, Bacow pointed to a series of student and staff success stories.
Bacow spoke in particular about Calixto Sáenz, a former Harvard Medical School cashier who is now director of HMS’ microfluidics core facility. He pointed to Sáenz’s story as emblematic of the University’s support for workers through the Bridge Program, an adult education and training program that offers English language classes, citizenship test review, and other resources for Harvard workers.
“The Bridge Program is aimed really at our employees — and employees who really are sort of menial employees,” Bacow said. “It’s an extraordinarily effective program.”
With just over two months left in his presidency, Bacow’s speech Friday echoed a note on which he began his presidency. In both his keynote speech this weekend and his 2018 presidential installment ceremony, Bacow emphasized the importance of immigration in furthering the national interest by protecting “human capital.”
“We live in a world right now where the only true scarce capital is human capital,” Bacow said Friday, nearly a verbatim quote from his installation speech.
Bacow also pointed to the importance of including international students on college campuses to “enhance the experience of our domestic students,” during his speech on Friday.
“What our institutions do now, when we take a kid who’s had to struggle his or her entire life and we give them a good education — a great education — we are investing in the human capital that our nation needs,” he said.
But Bacow closed out his speech by redirecting attention away from Harvard and toward public universities — whose presidents, provosts, and other administrators made up a majority of the audience — praising them for “doing God’s work” and being “worthy of our support.”
“Now, if you want more examples of how this kind of work is really, really done, and done I think exceptionally well, don’t look at Harvard,” he said.
“It’s up to us to work together with you to enable the American dreams,” he said.

Dear reader, 
Love is not real, happiness does not exist, and life has lost all its meaning. 
That’s right: Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have officially broken up.
How can we possibly go on? She wrote DAYLIGHT about THIS MAN. He was the 1 who made love golden??? He was the king of her heart?? HER LONDON BOY?? WHAT HAPPENED TAYLUH??
If you are nearly as disoriented as I am by this news, please feel free to join me on my road to recovery.
Step one: Deny, deny, deny. 
Did you ever hear about the girl who lives in delusion? Yeah, that’s me. It didn’t happen if I don’t believe it happened. Let’s think: how many times has Entertainment Tonight reported that they were engaged? Married? Pregnant? Too many for them to ever be reliable. Taylor and Joe have the privacy sign on their door!! Everyone is saying the end is coming, but she’s running home to his sweet nothings!
Just like I refuse to accept Harvard men’s incapability of romance, I refused to even CONSIDER the reports.
Then, People magazine confirmed it. Then, CNN. Then, Taylor cried performing Champagne Problems.
*voice breaks* Maybe it is real then??
Step two: Rationalize.
Okay — she replaced “invisible string” with “the 1” on her tour. Either she’s messing with us, or she is fully confirming the news. Either way, I’ve come to the casually cruel realization that:
Cornelia street will never be walked again.
She can go anywhere she wants, just not home.
The story of them looks a lot like a tragedy now.
Step 3: Prepare (mentally)
We are officially going to be listening to Taylor Swift’s breakup songs to get over Taylor Swift’s breakup.
In one aspect, this is a good thing. Not for her of course, but like… for me. Girl has been writing too many love songs lately. I just can’t relate. The entire Lover album has induced more of my tears than “Dear John” ever did.
Is this a sad, beautiful tragedy … or inspiration? Call it what you want, but that next album is going to hit. Blondie wrote “Last Kiss” (aka the most gut-wrenching, soul-shattering song) about a man she dated for three months.
This was SIX YEARS. SIX YEARS WORTH OF PAIN (& LYRICS).
Step 4: Accept.
Everything happens for a reason. People break up, people grow apart, and people move on. We know this all too well.
At least now she won’t have to settle for paper rings or cheap-ass screw-top rosé (jokes!) (still love you joe!)
Now grab your tissues, make her famous chai cookie recipe, and blast this playlist.
Don’t worry, she will begin again. Love is not dead (right?)

Students flocked to Tercentenary Theatre on Sunday afternoon to watch performances from student groups, Coco & Breezy, and headliner Jeremih at Yardfest, the College’s annual spring concert for undergraduates.
Sunday’s Yardfest festivities began in the afternoon with residential community block parties. Above, students at the River West party in the Winthrop House courtyard.
Students brought signs and poster cut-outs of band members’ faces for the two opening student groups: Weld 16 and Beacon St.
Weld 16 and Beacon St won opening spots at Yardfest in a “Battle for Yardfest” event at Sanders Theatre in March.
Hundreds of students attended Yardfest for its second year back in person.
