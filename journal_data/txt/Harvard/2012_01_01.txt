After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Kyle Casey — 10.7 PPG, 51.1% FG-percentage, 5.7 rebounds (2011-2012 season)
The 6’7’’, 225-pounder isn’t a typical small forward or power forward, but falls somewhere in between. He has the ability to knock down an open three, make a play at the rim, or pull up for a jump shot anywhere in between. Casey has also shown his talent down on the block where he can post up and make the right move at the right time.
As a junior, Casey is second on the Crimson in shot attempts, averaging 7.7 per game, but he has earned his turn with the ball. Against Boston University on Dec. 10, Casey had his first 20-point outing of the year after making all five of his free throws and cashing in on an open three-pointer. He added nine rebounds in the victory. Who in the NBA can match the numerous weapons Casey wields?
Lamar Odom, Dallas Mavericks — 14.4 PPG, 53.0% FG-percentage, 8.7 rebounds (2010-2011 season)
While Odom stands three inches taller than Casey, he has also shined in moments at small forward, power forward, and even center. An athletically gifted player with a decent three-point stroke, Odom has never been able to elevate to superstar status, but is an important role player with a penchant to make a remarkable play or two every game.
Honorable Mentions: Paul Millsap (UTAH), Rudy Gay (MEM), Derrick Williams (MIN)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team didn’t quite get what it was looking for this holiday season.
Four Crimson wrestlers finished with an 4-9 overall record at the 49th Annual Ken Kraft Midlands Championship, held Wednesday through Thursday in Evanston, Ill. Junior Steven Keith nabbed Harvard’s top result of eighth place at 133 pounds.
“It was a great tournament for us to see where we’re at,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “We usually peak three times a year, and that’s our second peak, so I wasn’t too pleased with the overall thing, but I know we can move forward from there.”
Iowa captured the title with 152 points, over 50 points above second-place finisher Northwestern. The Crimson finished in 32nd place in the 42-team field with 9.5 points.
Junior co-captain Walter Peppelman did not compete in the event because of an injury he sustained at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational.
Wrestling at 133 lbs., Keith, the No. 6 seed, finished with a 3-3 record at the event, giving him a 16-6 record overall this season. With the eighth place finish—something Keith has matched or exceeded in every tournament on Harvard’s schedule so far—the junior earned a spot on the podium.
After receiving a bye in the first round, Keith controlled his opponent in the following round, earning a 12-4 major decision over unseeded Dalton Bullard of Elmhurst. He followed up his dominance with a 10-0 blowout of No. 11 seed Thomas Kelliher of Wisconsin.
Keith’s momentum began to dissipate, though, and the junior fell to the No. 3 seed AJ Schopp from Edinboro. Schopp had turned in two impressive performances in the second and third rounds as well, defeating unseeded Chris Perez of Princeton and Rob Jillard of Northern Illinois, 7-1 and 9-2, respectively. Schopp pinned Keith at 5:30, forcing Keith into the wrestlebacks to earn a spot on the podium.
Keith won his first bout in the wrestlebacks, defeating No. 5 seed Bryan Ortenzio of Penn in a 5-3 decision, but then went on to lose his next matchup against No. 7 seed Ryan Mango of Stanford when Mango pinned him at 3:53, sending Keith to the seventh-place match. The junior was once again pinned by unseeded Joe Colon of Northern Iowa at 1:18.
“Steven wrestled really well,” Weiss said. “He placed eighth, but he was in a lot of matches. He had a nice win against [Penn’s Bryan Ortenzio], who beat him earlier. It’s always nice to beat guys who have defeated you earlier in the season.”
Freshman James Fox, wrestling at 197 lbs., went 1-2 in his first Midlands Championships, making him the only other Crimson wrestler to earn a victory at the event.
Despite his early success this season, Fox had a tough draw for the tournament, facing No. 5 seed Byron Tate of Wartburg in the second round. After a first round bye, the unseeded Harvard wrestler fell in an 11-1 major decision.
In the wrestlebacks, Fox earned his lone victory, topping unseeded Thomas Lira of Iowa. The bout was close, but Fox pulled through, taking the 11-9 decision.
In his final two matches, Fox—who had felt ill since the start of the event—forfeited due to sickness.
At 184 lbs., sophomore Cameron Croy went 0-2. The No. 11 seed faced unseeded Erich Smith of Penn in the first round, falling in a close 6-5 decision. In the wrestlebacks, Croy dropped another close bout to the No. 12 seed, Tim Foley, in a 3-2 decision.
Rounding out the four Crimson grapplers at the event, freshman Ryan Osleeb joined Keith in the 133 lbs. division. Like Croy, Osleeb was unable to pull out a victory in his first Midlands Championship, losing his match in the championship bracket and the wrestlebacks.
Osleeb lost his first contest in a lopsided battle to another unseeded wrestler, Mike Demarco, who handled the rookie in a a 14-2 major decision. Osleeb’s bout in the wrestlebacks was closer, but the result was still the same. In a low-scoring matchup, unseeded Derek Malan of Utah Valley topped the freshman in a 1-0 decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It truly is the most wonderful time of the year. On Dec. 25, we all shared in a gift that is way better than any Christmas sweater or box of chocolates. Yep, professional basketball is back. To ring in the good times, we at The Back Page have set out to find the best NBA match for several of Harvard’s own ballers. Which NBA player is most like each Crimson star? Keep reading to find out.
Laurent Rivard — 10.2 PPG, 44.3% 3-pt percentage, 80.0% FT-percentage (2011-2012 season)
The championship mountain biker came to Cambridge last season as a freshman and brought a freakishly accurate three-point and free-throw shot. In his first campaign, Rivard shot 88.3% from the charity stripe and averaged 11 points per game. The Canadian returned to the court this year and has continued to do what he does best: knock down shots. He currently is third in program history in three-point shooting, boasting a percentage of 41.3 during his short career.
The sharpshooter has yet to start a game for the Crimson this year, but he has become increasingly valuable. Against Boston University on Dec. 10, Rivard tallied a career-high six treys, confirming that he is someone opponents need to keep an eye on. But if you wanted to see what Rivard would look like in the professional circuit, to whom would you turn your eye?
Jason Kapono, L.A. Lakers — 6.9 PPG, 43.7% 3-pt percentage, 83.4% FT-percentage (career)
Kapono has bounced around during his nine years in the league and now finds himself with his sixth NBA team, the Los Angeles Lakers. But while his jersey has changed often, one thing has remained the same: his silky smooth jump shot. When Kapono got significant playing time during a stint in Miami, he lit it up from deep, shooting 51.4 percent from beyond the arc. That year, he also knocked down 89.2 percent from the charity stripe. Like Rivard, the UCLA-grad is not his team’s top scorer, but his shooting ability makes him a key role player.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In our weekly feature, we at The Crimson track the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
In his final game of the 2011 NFL season, Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 gave a performance that mirrored his entire year.
After jumping out to a 21-0 lead at the end of the first quarter against the New England Patriots, Fitzpatrick and the Bills spiraled out of control, giving up 49 unanswered points and ending a once-promising season in embarrassing fashion.
“Fitzmagic” seemed to lose his magic after a first quarter in which he threw 12-for-15 and two touchdown passes. In three second quarter drives, Fitzpatrick failed to put points on the board. Meanwhile, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady brought his team back into the game, pulling New England within a touchdown by halftime.
The second half was all Brady, as the Patriots scored on all five of their second half possessions. While Brady’s 300th career touchdown pass put the game out of reach, Fitzpatrick ended his season with two consecutive interceptions.
Once playoff contenders, Fitzpatrick and Buffalo jumped out to a 4-2 start, earning a new contract with $24 million in guaranteed money. But since signing his new deal, Fitzpatrick and the Bills have collapsed, finishing the remainder of the season with a 2-8 record, meaning Buffalo will miss the postseason for the 12th consecutive season.
While Fitzpatrick goes home, Matt Birk ’98 and the Baltimore Ravens clinched the AFC’s No. 2 seed with a 24-16 defeat of the Cincinnati Bengals.
Birk, an offensive lineman, and the rest of the Ravens finished atop the AFC North with a 12-4 record and will have a bye in the first round of the playoffs.
As the NFL regular season winds down, things are just getting started for Jeremy Lin ’10.
Picked up by the New York Knicks off waivers last week, the point guard has seen limited action in all of the Knicks’ games since his arrival.
Seeing the court for the final four minutes in a New Year’s Eve win against the Sacramento Kings, the former Leverett House resident struggled. Though he recorded one rebound, one assist, and one steal, Lin also turned the ball over twice, picked up four fouls, and had multiple fall-downs, three of which came during this stretch of disaster. And that performance came one night after this.
During the young season, Lin has registered -11.04 Player Efficiency Rating, a metric designed to evaluate a per-minute rating of a player’s performance. Lin is currently the only member of the team with a negative PER, and New York City has not taken kindly to its newest player. On RealGM's Knicks message board, threads were started entitled "Worst Player In Knicks History" (yes, dedicated to Jeremy) and "What should the Knicks do with Jeremy Lin?" (most suggested waive him, while one poster believes they should murder him).
Lin will have the chance to turn things around on Monday when the the Knicks take on the Toronto Raptors at Madison Square Garden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traveling halfway across the country, the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-4-4, 3-3-2 ECAC) went 0-1-1 against No. 18 University of North Dakota (10-8-2, 7-7 WCHA) in a two-game series to finish out 2011. Senior forward Alex Killorn led the Crimson offense with two goals and two assists, while five other Harvard players each netted a goal across the two-day period.
The Crimson scored first in both games, but UND, who, as of Jan. 1, no longer uses its former mascot—never allowed Harvard to take the lead again after netting goals of its own.
While the first game saw the Crimson, down two goals, rally in the third period to come back and tie, the second contest was a decisive victory by North Dakota.
“It was a good opportunity to play a good team in front of a large crowd,” junior defenseman Danny Biega said. “It’s a tough atmosphere to play in, and although we didn’t win, the team took many positive steps in the right direction.”
NORTH DAKOTA 7, HARVARD 3
The day after a third-period, two-goal comeback to tie, Harvard men’s hockey was unable to come from behind again last night, losing to University of North Dakota, 7-3, and breaking its five-game unbeaten streak.
The Crimson dominated the beginning of the contest. After winning the opening faceoff, Harvard outshot UND, 10-2, before Killorn rocketed a left-handed shot past North Dakota goaltender Aaron Dell. Killorn’s goal came during a power play—Harvard is ranked first in the nation with a 32.1-percent success rate.
But the Crimson’s only lead of the game was short-lived, and a goal by UND’s Brendan O’Donnell tied the game back at two.
Soon after, Killorn was sent to the penalty box for tripping, and North Dakota capitalized on Harvard’s low-ranked power-play defense, scoring a mere five seconds into the power play.
Down, 2-1, freshman forward Mike Seward fought for the puck past the right side of UND’s goal and hit it back towards senior forward Eric Kroshus, who was trailing behind. Kroshus hit a one-timer, but Dell grabbed the puck for the save, and Harvard remained trailing by one.
With less than seven minutes to play in the first period, North Dakota pulled its goalie after a delayed penalty call to add an extra attacker. The move proved to be a smart one when a well placed shot by Danny Kristo gave UND the 3-1 advantage.
Following the goal, Harvard faced a team penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct that put it a man down on the ice. North Dakota stayed patient, passing the puck around the horn until Nick Mattson found Kristo, who redirected the puck into the net.
As the clock ticked the final seconds of the frame, Kroshus brought his team back within two, shooting at close range and allowing his momentum to carry him over Dell and into the goal along with the puck.
The second period did not bode well for the Crimson either. Within the first minute, UND lifted themselves ahead a goal further, and yet another score later in the frame put the scoreboard at 6-2 in favor of North Dakota.
Despite power play opportunities, including a five-minute major penalty on Andrew Panzarella for contact to the head, Harvard failed to score again until the third period when junior forward Luke Greiner put away a cross from freshman defenseman Max Everson.
Play went back-and-forth for the next few minutes, but a seventh North Dakota goal crushed Harvard’s hopes of staging another comeback like the one against University of New Hampshire earlier in the season, in which Harvard erased a four-goal deficit in the third period to win.
“We battled hard,” freshman forward Petr Placek said. “But we had a few unlucky calls and unlucky goals against us, and it was hard to get back into the game.”
The game ended with UND on top, 7-3, only a couple of hours before the new year.
HARVARD 4, NORTH DAKOTA 4
In the first of the two-game series, Harvard tied North Dakota, 4-4, Thursday night in a back-and-forth overtime battle.
The Crimson got on the board first. With just under five minutes left to play in the first period, freshman defenseman Patrick McNally slipped one past the goalie to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
But UND came out hot in the second, notching back-to-back goals within the first two minutes of the frame. Killorn, who finished the game 17-4 in faceoffs, continued the scoring frenzy and netted one of his own less than a minute later to tie the game at two.
Though the rest of the period saw back-and-forth play, North Dakota found the back of the net two more times in the period to give the home team a 4-2 edge going into the second break.
Despite its struggles in the second period, Harvard took control of the third frame. Junior forwards Alex Fallstrom and Marshall Everson each tallied a goal midway through the final frame of regulation, propelling the Crimson into overtime with the score knotted at four.
Starting with a penalty early on, Harvard found itself on its heels in overtime and failed to record a single shot. North Dakota had four, but freshman goaltender Steve Michalek, who had 33 saves on the night, corralled them all, and the game ended with both teams frozen at four.'
