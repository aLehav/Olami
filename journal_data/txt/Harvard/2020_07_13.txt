After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In March, with five days’ notice, we were forced to leave a place many of us called home, with little to no support from the administration. We scrambled to find necessities like storage and flights home in between tearful and unexpected goodbyes to many of the people we love. After all of this distress, some of us had hoped Harvard would have learned and would prepare more thoroughly if COVID-19 continued to rage on. But it didn’t.
Instead, at Monday’s Zoom “town hall,” held to address questions regarding the College’s plans for the fall semester, we were offered nothing but vague platitudes and “resources” that will barely make a dent in students’ needs. Furthermore, the administration refused to allow student voices to be heard at all during the meeting. Today, it is clearer than ever before what many of us have known all along — Harvard will always put its obscene amounts of money and prestige above the material needs of its students.
One of the administration’s many failures is its atrocious response to students who truly need to be on campus. A “questionnaire” that assumes all situations can be explained by yes or no questions and a box for students to “elaborate” turns a resource that should help students into a game. Worse, the general framing of the appeal process forces students to share their traumas and painful home environments to prove they really need to be back on campus. It is absolutely heartless to require this of students, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. We demand that the College immediately revise this policy.
First, it should be made clear that these are confidential documents — these are students’ lives, and they should not be treated lightly. Second, the administration must be more transparent regarding the circumstances that determine eligibility. Finally, and most importantly, the College should explicitly allow petitioners to refrain from going into detail about their situations. No student should have to retraumatize themselves for the bare minimum necessity of living conditions conducive to learning.
The administration has proudly announced a $5,000 “remote room and board” allowance per semester for students who decide to take online classes off-campus, but this is yet another misstep. The total cost of room and board is $9,914, but for whatever reason, the College has included less than that in students’ financial aid budgets in the middle of a pandemic. Furthermore, for students in unsafe living situations who are not invited to return to campus, and students who must provide for their families, the College’s allotted aid is not enough. The administration must adjust its financial aid to address the individual needs of the student body, and it must do so in amounts at or more than $9,914.
The College also announced that the fall semester would mark a return to letter grading. Their reasoning is that the spring semester’s emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system was implemented only because of the upheaval and distress caused by our forced evictions in March. However, just because we are now off-campus does not mean that the chaos has stopped. There are many of us whose economic, physical, mental, and social well-being continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus. Thus, it is crucial that the administration implement a universal “Double A” system or a universal pass system to help ease the stressors marginalized and vulnerable students are under and allow them to continue their education without fearing for their futures.
While the College has stated that the liberal leave of absence policy would not be affected, considerable changes must be made in order to provide equity for students. Those of us who are first-generation low-income, BGLTQ+, or members of other marginalized groups must be given enough financial aid to allow us to take leaves of absence that we otherwise could not take. Students who take leaves of absence must also be given full coverage under the University’s healthcare services — especially those with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or disorders.
Harvard has once again failed in its moral obligation to address completely the needs of all its students. First, Harvard must clearly state that details are not required in one’s appeal — transparency, privacy, and protection of students from retraumatization should all come before any requirement to “prove” one’s need for on-campus housing. Second, it must grant students, especially FGLI students, all the resources necessary to live in these conditions — namely, an allowance at or above the normal room and board costs. Third, it must grant a more generous grading policy — whether that be universal “Double A,” a universal pass, or at least universal pass-fail with GPA credit given for a pass. Finally, it must ensure that gap years are an option for all students, not just students with disposable income.
We demand that Harvard prioritize the critical needs of students, especially marginalized students. No more inaction disguised in meaningless buzzwords.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week — 118 anxious days after Harvard ordered its students leave campus mid-semester — the College made its long-awaited announcement detailing how the 2020-2021 academic year will unfold.
One hundred percent online classes. Zero percent tuition reduction. Forty percent density in residence, with housing only guaranteed for freshmen. For them, plus the upperclassmen who manage to successfully petition for on-campus housing, alien and isolated living conditions await, marked by the prospect of three solitary bagged meals per day and two mandatory COVID tests per week. The only social spaces left open on campus? Laundry rooms.
Harvard’s cautious roadmap for reopening amid America’s surging coronavirus outbreak — guided by an evidence-based and expert-led risk management approach — stands in stark contrast to the denialist narrative coming from the executive branch of the federal government. Its playbook has been to downplay the pandemic’s spread, despite Friday marking a record high of new daily coronavirus cases and eight states setting records for daily coronavirus deaths this week, and to bully schools into reopening with international students as the bargaining chip.
President Donald Trump himself called Harvard’s plan “ridiculous.” We disagree.
Harvard’s decision to limit the number of undergraduate students on campus and to instigate strict social distancing and public health precautions for the 40 percent who do return is a responsible one. These high-level choices reflect a broader belief in the value of public health and safety — and more fundamentally, of human life  — that we share. They also reflect a belief in making decisions that are grounded in evidence, even when the evidence doesn’t make us feel great.
Our trust that Harvard’s decision will protect our community’s health and safety doesn’t make its impact any less heartbreaking. Something serious is being lost here: The college experience we imagined pre-pandemic is gone. This journey we set out on together no longer feels shared, as class-years become splintered by geography, time zones, and an anticipated avalanche of leaves of absence.
To our classmates: This sucks so much. We miss you. But the situation we find ourselves in isn’t Harvard’s doing. Reprehensible federal governance is entirely to blame.
Still, doing better than the Trump administration definitely doesn’t mean you’re doing great. Despite its stated commitment to transparent communication, the College’s initial rollout of its reopening plan has been confusing and left many questions unanswered.
What will life on campus look like for the 40 percent of undergraduates on campus? Will they be able to interact with … anyone? Administrators floated limited social “pods” of 10 to 15 students, but in the College’s bare bones and dystopian Residential Community Compact, they are nowhere to be found. With the deadline to petition for on-campus housing Monday, we’re still left wondering what campus life will look like — what traditions, joys, and degree of social interaction will remain.
And of perhaps equal significance, Harvard needs to ensure that students taking time off — especially low-income and international students — have a place on campus to return to. Despite the logistical difficulties, Harvard needs to make good on its four-year residential promise.
How will academics work? The College recently mandated two to four hours of live interaction per week, per course regardless of the timezone — how this will play out around the world is anyone’s guess. Classes requiring hands-on learning will have to be transfigured, if possible, to an online setting. Pre-registration, the norm for most other schools, is now required for the first time at Harvard. How will these new changes affect course offerings and experience?
Why charge full tuition? This decision implies that the entire Harvard experience — or at least the parts worth paying for — can be replicated in full on a laptop, sending a striking message about what Harvard believes to be the value of the education it provides. What are we paying for: the experience or the brand?
And what of the cost of living? “Obviously,” as Harvard’s top administrators put it, no one living off-campus will be paying for room and board. But the $5,000 the College will award students receiving financial aid — full or partial — seems deeply insufficient.  It’s better this allowance exists than not, but it will significantly disincentivize both moving on-campus and taking time off for students who, amid mass unemployment and a recession, need the cash but might benefit from either of those options. Moreover, why isn’t this allowance distributed according to the degree of student’s financial aid?
Likewise, the emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system has been abandoned — but have the concerns that brought this grading system about gone away? Not really. How can students — or even faculty for that matter — be sure that the fall’s Zoom classes will really be all that much smoother than the spring’s? And why does the University presume the personal and socioeconomic issues that troubled many students in the spring have suddenly disappeared?
How will campus mental health services adapt to provide online services, with demand likely to increase as the stress and disorder of pandemic life carries on without pause? That can’t be an afterthought. Every passing day of this global crisis makes it an ever more pressing concern.
Harvard shared its plans with only a month to go until shopping week. Presumably, the College needed time to iron out a comprehensive reopening plan and make a decision up-to-date with public health realities. Why, then, after so many weeks of waiting, are students still having to track down answers to obvious questions?
We’re grateful for Harvard’s caution when it comes to public health, but student life concerns — now spread across the globe — require the same rigorous consideration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 12, 2020, at 11:32 p.m.
Ahead of a Tuesday hearing, supporters within and outside Harvard have begun to prepare and file amicus briefs in the University’s lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.
The lawsuit, which Harvard filed Wednesday with MIT, seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions that would prevent immigration authorities from enforcing new guidelines that bar international students taking online-only courses from residing in the United States.
For Judge Allison D. Burroughs to grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction — the subject of the upcoming hearing — Harvard and MIT have to prove that they are likely to win the lawsuit on its merits and that the guidelines will cause irreparable harm if they are enforced while the litigation is in process.
At a pretrial hearing on Friday, Burroughs told William F. “Bill” Lee ’72 — a lawyer for Harvard and MIT and the Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation — to instruct potential amici to focus on the “big-ticket” item of the likelihood of success at trial rather than irreparable harm.
But the issue of harm — top-of-mind for international students grappling with the issue in real-time — has garnered more attention thus far from affiliates and potential amici.
In an email to concentrators Thursday, Economics director of undergraduate studies Jeffrey Miron asked students to contact Allen D. Aliose, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’s dean for administration and finance, with stories about how the guidelines would impact them so that the narratives could be passed to the Office of the General Counsel.
“One thing to think about: this judge is very responsive to stories of students liable to suffer ‘irreparable harm’ from the ruling,” Miron wrote.
In one recent high-profile case, Burroughs found Harvard students' testimony convincing. She presided over the anti-affirmative action lawsuit between Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions in Oct. 2018, and in her ruling in favor of the University, she mentioned the experiences of the eight students and alumni who testified as amici.
“It is likely that eliminating consideration of race would significantly disadvantage at least some Asian American applicants, as evidenced by the testimony of the amici at trial, all of whom viewed their race or ethnicity as a critical aspect of their life experiences and applications to Harvard,” Burroughs wrote at the time.
Though it remains unclear if students’ stories will have the same impact in this case — and Burroughs said they were not her primary focus — efforts to collect them have continued.
James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21, the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, also sent an email to students on Saturday informing them of an effort by “various student governments” to file an amicus brief.
Student governments at 15 other universities have already been in contact with legal counsel at the law firm Clifford Chance, per Mathew and White-Thorpe’s email. Though the UC will not vote on its involvement in the lawsuit until Sunday, it has already begun collecting student narratives due to “how time-sensitive and important” the issue is.
“As the student body of one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs, our voices are especially valuable,” Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote.
More than 50 colleges and universities — including Brown University, Cornell University, Princeton University, and the University of Pennsylvania — also filed an amicus in support of Harvard's motion for a preliminary injunction Sunday.
The Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration — a coalition of American college and university chancellors and presidents committed to increasing public understanding of immigration policies and their implications on education — filed a brief on behalf of 180 member schools in support of Harvard and MIT Friday. The amicus brief focuses on how higher education institutions relied on guidance issued by ICE in March while planning for the fall semester.
The member schools’ brief also notes that the new guidance issued by ICE will place “significant burdens” on international students — an issue Harvard focused on in its own filings. Court filings revealed the reasoning behind its decision to continue remote instruction, which administrators wrote was largely informed by the assumption that previously issued guidelines would be “in effect for the duration of the emergency.”
Miriam Feldblum, the Executive Director of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, wrote in a press release that ICE’s policy only serves to “severely disrupt” the lives of international students.
“This quasi–international student ban represents another unfortunate assault by the administration against immigrants and higher education—a ban made especially disappointing given SEVP’s former guidance that promoted and recognized the need for flexibility amidst a global pandemic,” Feldblum wrote. “The number of institutions speaking out on behalf of international students demonstrates the breadth of support for international students and the appreciation of the immense contributions they bring to all our campuses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council unanimously adopted legislation on July 12 to join an amicus brief in support of the ongoing Harvard-MIT lawsuit against immigration authorities, alongside student body representative groups from 15 other universities.
The group’s unanimous vote to pass Act 38E-18 — sponsored by the UC’s Finance Committee Chair Mini Ganesh ’22, and co-sponsored by President James A. Mathew ’21, Vice-President Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21, and Secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 — enables the Council to provide students’ testimonials and represent those individuals as part of the amicus brief led by Clifford Chance, the legal counsel representing students in the case. The firm is set to file in court tomorrow at 9 a.m.
Harvard and MIT filed the suit last week in a bid to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security from barring international students attending online-only classes from residing in the U.S.
The student testimonials the Council endorsed are aimed at nullifying the government’s potential claim that Harvard and MIT are unqualified to argue their case on the basis of not being directly affected by ICE’s order, Mathew said in an interview.
Mathew added he believes students’ stories would benefit Harvard and MIT by providing a more “emotional” and “human” edge to their argument in court.
“In this case, this external counsel — so that’s Clifford Chance in this case — has encouraged us that making this argument as human as possible can really make a difference and be effective,” he said.
Testimonials included in an amicus brief filed by a student government, such as the UC, would protect students’ anonymity — an aspect critical to ensuring the safety of participating students, Ganesh said during the Council’s Sunday afternoon meeting.
“For example, if a student is LGBTQ, and their family does not know this, and going back to their home country with that information could be dangerous for them, then that is a situation where we don’t want something like that to happen to any student who we represent,” Ganesh said.
Prior to the Council’s official endorsement of the amicus brief, Mathew and White-Thorpe sent an email to undergraduates Saturday linking a form for international students to provide their contact information to Clifford Chance as part of an effort to collect enough testimonials before Monday.
Twenty-nine Harvard students have completed the form, according to Mathew, though he anticipates many of these testimonials will be excluded from the fifteen-page brief featuring students from the other 15 universities.
Mathew also said Sunday that the Council’s involvement in the amicus brief signifies its commitment to the international students who constitute roughly 12 percent of the College and 20 percent of the University’s entire student body.
“It says that we stand with our international students and that they have a place here on campus. This is everyone's Harvard; it’s not just students-who-are-from-the-United States’ Harvard,” White-Thorpe said. “Harvard should be accessible to everyone. I think that's really kind of what we're saying with this amicus brief, that international students are imperative to our community at Harvard.”
In the event Harvard’s suit proves unsuccessful, White-Thorpe said she foresees the Council urging Harvard administrators to offer a one to two credit in-person course to international students, an option pursued by some other American universities in response to the order.
“What's happening is just not fair to them. The way that they're being ostracized is completely, completely unfair,” White-Thorpe said. “And the administration needs to acknowledge them. I think that they have, in terms of filing against ICE. But I think that there's more that we can do from an academic lens, to continue supporting our international students.”
From now until the case’s outcome, Mathew said he hopes other students will continue advocating for their international peers.
“If you know an international student, if you're friends with them, I think you should just be providing emotional support,” Mathew said. “A lot of this is out of our hands, in terms of what's going on in the courts. But I think just being there for the students and kind of providing that community is really key.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares to welcome first-year students and a select group of upperclassmen to campus, the Dean of Students Office unveiled its “residential community compact” — a list of guidelines those residing on campus in the fall must follow.
“Harvard College aims to provide a residential environment that enables student learning and provides a safe place for students during the public health emergency occasioned by the global COVID-19 pandemic,” the compact reads.
“Because COVID-19 infects individuals by spreading across and within close community networks, it is essential that every one of us in the residential community enters into a shared obligation and commitment to act prudently, safely, and in accordance with public health directives,” it adds.
The release of the residential guidelines comes nearly a week after University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the College would only provide on-campus accommodations for up to 40 percent of the undergraduate student population.
Those who do return will enter a residential situation bearing little resemblance to the one the College normally offers.
Students are expected to receive the seasonal flu vaccine, clean their own residential spaces and bathrooms, and only access their assigned residential buildings. They must “remain in the immediate area” and inform their resident dean of any plans for essential travel.
The residential guidelines also require students to participate in routine COVID-19 testing, wear masks or facial coverings in any public areas, refrain from inviting guests or other students into residential suites, and self-isolate if infected with coronavirus.
To further encourage social distancing, students will only have “limited access” to Faculty of Arts and Sciences buildings and “restricted access” to most buildings, including gyms and libraries. In addition, students are reminded that “virtual socializing” should be the “first option for social contact.”
Returnees who believe that they cannot comply with College rules are asked to “remove [themselves] from campus and complete [the] semester remotely,” according to the compact.
If they do not proactively do so, the document also outlines measures for removing students who transgress.
Students found in violation of the compact will have their “alleged” behavior reviewed by the Community Council, an assembly of Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct staff. The Community Council will then determine whether or not the student will remain on campus.
The compact urges students to abide by the guidelines as a means of protecting both themselves and other students.
“Residential students must be particularly sensitive to the fact that their neighbors or fellow residents are impacted by their decisions. In a de-densified residential setting, strong communication skills and empathy for others are important characteristics to cultivate,” the compact reads.
