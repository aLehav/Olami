After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though she had to wait a week longer for it than she would have liked to, head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s 600th win proved to be a comfortable one. A barrage of early scoring by sophomore forward Rachel Levy, making just her second career start, gave Harvard an early lead over Cornell, and the Crimson never looked back en route to a 80-38 win at Lavieties Pavilion.
Delaney-Smith, in the 37th season of her iconic Harvard coaching career, downplayed the accomplishment but went on to acknowledge its significance.
“I think if you stay somewhere long enough it is bound to happen,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think it [the 600th win] is great, but I’m never really that caught up in things that I accomplish — I feel much better about how we connected with each other on the court. That makes me really happy. But I am very proud to have 600 wins. I’m sure not everybody does that.”
While Delaney-Smith was quick to shift the night’s focus to the team’s performance, Levy emphasized how special her coach’s 600th win was.
“I think that’s the reason that everyone comes here is for Kathy,” Levy said, “And to be a part of this program that she’s spent so long building and being able to be here for that 600th win means so much more than just basketball. It stands for everything that she’s done in her career, all the lives that she’s affected, all the women she’s stood up for, so just being able to have my name on that 600th win is huge.”
It was a comprehensive performance by Harvard (15-11, 8-5 Ivy), which locked up the third seed in the Ivy League tournament next weekend in the victory. The Crimson entered the break up 44-13 after dominating on both ends of the court but especially defensively, where it held the Bears’ (11-13, 5-8) unsightly offense to 5-of-25 shooting and forcing 16 turnovers.
Unlike at times in its comfortable home victories over Brown and Yale two weekends ago, Harvard kept its foot on the gas pedal in the second half. The Crimson pushed its lead over 40 points in the third quarter and held that 40+ point lead throughout the fourth before eventually winning by 42.
After struggling with turnovers last weekend against Penn and Princeton, Harvard took care of the ball much better Friday night, as the Crimson turned the ball over just nine times and finished with a turnover margin of +10.
“If we can play like this we can beat anybody,” Delaney-Smith said. “And I honestly believe that both the Penn and Princeton games could have gone our way had we not turned the ball over.”
On a night in which Harvard was missing sophomore forward Jadyn Bush, its third leading scorer and leading rebounder, the Crimson showed off its depth. With Bush, who is set to miss Saturday’s game but will likely be back for the Ivy League tournament, out, Harvard’s three other average double-digit scorers — captain guard Madeline Raster, junior guard Katie Benzan, and junior forward Jeannie Boehm — combined for 32 points. Benzan led the team with 17, nine of which came in a hot shooting third quarter.
But it was the other — less heralded but still crucial — members of the Crimson’s rotation who bore much of the brunt of the scoring load. Levy, making her first start since a game against Rutgers early in the season, scored 15 points, including 13 in the first half on efficient 5-of-6 shooting, in a team-leading 26 minutes.
She was just as active on the defensive end, particularly in the first half, when she racked up three steals and blocked shots on consecutive second quarter possessions, putting an exclamation mark on Harvard’s excellent defensive second quarter, a quarter in which the Crimson forced as many turnovers (10) as Cornell shots.
“Rachel’s a good defensive player,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s a kid who was a guard her whole life and then fractured her knee before coming here, so basically didn’t play her freshman year. And then she grew an enormous amount of inches and all of a sudden she’s not a guard anymore. That has been a big transition and she has done a great job of learning the game from the inside-out and not the outside-in. She did a nice job tonight.”
Diminutive senior guards Nani Redford and Sydney Skinner also made the most of their second-to-last career home games, scoring 13 points each. Redford made a number of tricky shots around the basket and also keyed Harvard’s impressive first half defensive performance, earning three of the Crimson’s 10 first half steals and harassing Cornell’s guards into a number of bad decisions.
Skinner brought her normal energy on both ends, as the 5’7” guard grabbed six offensive rebounds and added three assists in a tremendous all-around performance.
The offensive struggles were nothing new for the Bears, the Ivy League’s lowest scoring team at 57 points per game. Cornell hit just one three on nine attempts, with an end-of-quarter half-court heave that hit the shot clock serving as a good summary of its performance from beyond the arc.
Harvard was also excellent defensively against junior forward Laura Bagwell-Katalinich, Cornell’s leading scorer. After putting up a then-career high 25 points in the first meeting between the teams, Bagwell-Katalinich was held to 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting as part of a lethargic overall performance by the Bears.
The Crimson will return to action Saturday night at 5:00 against Columbia. With Friday night’s win locking up the third seed for Harvard, the stakes going into Saturday’s game are low, but the Crimson will be seeking to avenge its surprising 10-point loss in Morningside Heights two months ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you had told the casual Harvard men’s basketball fan that the team would sweep the season series against Yale, Penn, and Princeton, but lose both games to Cornell, you might be hard pressed to find someone that would believe you. Yet, sure enough — on Friday night —the Crimson fell to the Big Red by a 72-59 score, postponing a potential clinching of the Ivy League title until tomorrow night in New York City.
Cornell (14-15, 6-7 Ivy) entered play Friday night needing a victory, and help from Yale, to keep its slim tournament hopes alive. Despite the Big Red’s strong effort against Harvard, the Bulldogs fell to Penn at the Palestra, ending Cornell’s season and ensuring that Friday night would be senior guard Matt Morgan’s second to last game in a collegiate uniform.
The senior guard, largely unrecruited throughout high school, will graduate Cornell as the school’s leading scorer, and didn’t disappoint against the Crimson, scoring 31 points on 9-of-16 shooting. The Concord, N.C., native entered Friday night’s action averaging 22.3 points per game, a shade under his 22.5 points averaged in the 2017-2018 season.
Morgan was the lynchpin in the Big Red’s upset victory at Harvard, scoring crucial points late, and knocking down several free-throws to help hand the Crimson its first and only home loss in Ivy League play, and tormented the visitors for a second time this season.
“Matt Morgan is a gifted offensive player, he makes you pay for every mistake,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “His shotmaking, his confidence that he has, gives everybody else on their team confidence.”
In a matchup largely billed on Harvard’s Ivy League championship clinching possibility, as well as the intriguing head to head between Morgan and junior guard Bryce Aiken, the latter struggled mightily in Ithaca. Aiken finished with 17 points to lead the Crimson, but did so on just 4-of-18 shooting, knocking down merely one of his 10 shots from within the three-point arc. Aiken was the subject of several double teams and ferocious defense by multiple Cornell defenders, and labored along with the rest of his teammates, who shot under 30 percent as a group.
“We just had a tough night shooting the basketball,” Coach Amaker said. “We didn’t do a good job of defending them on the other side.”
Despite entering play as the third worst defense and the worst offense in the Ancient Eight, the Big Red came out fired up in front of their home fans. Morgan wasted little time getting it going at Newman Arena, drilling a triple just over a minute into the game. The senior was anchored to the bench for the final three minutes of the first half, however, after picking up two ill-advised fouls, both of which were of the loose-ball variety.
With Aiken scuffling, junior guard Christian Juzang stepped up in a big way in the early going, exploding for 11 points in the first half, to lead all scorers. Juzang would finish with 15 points and four rebounds, in 33 minutes. Despite a quick start from the Tarzana, Calif., native, and Chris Lewis, who scored six early points, the Crimson and Cornell entered halftime knotted at 29 points apiece. The hosts’ ability to keep the game close was largely thanks to nine first-half points from Morgan, and a bench that tallied seven points.
Astonishingly, Harvard entered the intermission with not a single bench point — an anomaly for a Amaker-led team that prides itself upon bench and balance. By the time the final horn sounded, the Crimson bench had generated just three total points, all of which came on a three-pointer from freshman Spencer Freedman with under a minute to play in garbage time. While scoring might have come at a premium from the bench, rebounding certainly did not.
For a second straight weekend, Danilo Djuricic made his presence felt on the glass, snaring rebounds at will. The Brampton, Ontario., native put up an astonishing nine rebounds, good enough for a career-high, in the first half alone. The sophomore forward would finish play with 10 boards, unable to penetrate the scoring sheet on his five field goal attempts.
The Big Red’s struggles on the glass continued against an oversized Harvard team, Friday night. The Crimson were able to garner 19 offensive rebounds against Cornell, shockingly only tallying six second second chance points. Harvard’s rebounding performance was hardly a surprise considering the Big Red’s rebounding margin on the seasons rested at negative five per game, far and away the worst in the Ancient Eight.
Morgan came out of halftime firing, drilling back to back three-pointers to give the hosts a six point lead. Back to back turnovers from Lewis compounded the issue, and allowed the Big Red to extend its run out of halftime to 8-0. The junior forward finished with a staggering seven turnovers, part of a 16-turnover effort by the visitors.

A 9-0 run for the Crimson in the middle of the second half, bookended by a flagrant foul on Terrance McBride against Catchings, allowed the visitors to take control with 12 minutes remaining. Playing with the lead, Harvard faltered, allowing Cornell to take a lead with a 9-0 run of their own.

With its backs against the wall, and the season on the line, the Big Red buckled down, getting stop after stop, allowing the hosts to extend a double-digit lead in front of a raucous home crowd.
“Tough night for us,” Coach Amaker said. “Give credit to Cornell and how tough they played throughout.”
When time had expired, the Crimson was left with a 13-point loss that didn’t truly reflect up how close the game was from wire-to-wire. Regardless, with a Bulldogs’ loss to the Quakers, either a Harvard win at Columbia, or a Yale loss at Princeton tomorrow night, will seal yet another regular season Ivy League title for Amaker’s team.
Hot as of late, it will be imperative for the Crimson to hit the reset button after Friday night’s disappointing loss — both for the sake of winning the league tomorrow night, and carrying momentum into the Ivy League tournament in New Haven, next weekend.
