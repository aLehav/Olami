After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 30, 2017 at 2:19 p.m.
At least two Harvard affiliates were barred from entering the United States after President Donald Trump suspended immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries Friday, and the University has warned international students not to leave the country.
Iranian scholars Seyed S. S. Saravi, a scientist who had been awarded a fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Samira Asgari, who planned to do research on tuberculosis at the Medical School, could not travel to the United States as a result of the ban.
Trump’s executive order suspends immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days and bars entry for refugees from Syria indefinitely. The policy sparked demonstrations and lawsuits across the country over the weekend, including an ‘emergency protest’ held in Harvard Square Friday.
In an email, Saravi called working at Harvard his “childhood dream.” Saravi was 16 months into the visa application process when Trump’s executive order tabled his bid Friday.
Saravi called the order’s association of Iranians with terrorism “really unfair and unrealistic,” as well as damaging to scientific communication across the globe.
“We want to learn and work more under supervision of top professors of your country in top universities and finally transfer our knowledge to students and extend the thought of science friendship,” he wrote. “I am so sorry for this decision.”
Saravi will travel to the United States embassy in Dubai Monday to appeal for a visa.
Asgari wrote in an email that she felt “punished for something I had nothing to do with” by Trump’s new immigration policy. She wrote she was standing in line to board her plane at an airport in Frankfurt, Germany on Saturday when a man approached her, introduced himself as a United States official, and told her her visa was not valid for travel.
“When I said, ‘But the visa clearly says it is a valid travel visa,’ he replied, ‘Yes, but the rules had changed since this morning,’” Asgari wrote.
A federal judge in New York blocked part of the order Saturday night by issuing a temporary stay, which prevents refugees who have already entered the country from being returned to their home countries. Soon afterward, federal judges in Massachusetts, Washington, and Virginia issued similar rulings.
The restraining order issued by the Mass. federal court prohibits officials from detaining or returning refugees and valid visa holders trying to enter the country. The ruling is set to expire in seven days.
The implications of the order remains uncertain as federal officials determine how to enforce it—White House and Department of Homeland Security officials said Sunday that legal residents could enter the United States.
“There’s a lot of confusion and uncertainty about how this order is going to be implemented in the short and long term,” Maggie Morgan, a fellow at the Harvard Law School Immigration and Refugee Clinic, said. “If you are a green card holder or on a valid student or employment visa from one of the affected countries, I think in general it’s advisable to exercise caution and postpone travel as much as possible outside of the United States until we have greater clarity as to how this order is going to be enforced.”
Law professor Gerald L. Neuman, who specializes in immigration law, said the order grants officials some discretion in enforcement, adding to the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s immigration restrictions. Neuman said he believes the order violates the Constitution.
“This executive order serves no valid purpose, and is incitement of discrimination against people on grounds of religion, and that should be unconstitutional,” he said.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Sunday, University President Drew G. Faust criticized the order and outlined steps the University is taking to support international affiliates and vulnerable student populations, including Muslim students and undocumented immigrants.
“Amid this widespread doubt and unease, we will continue to insist that policymakers take full account of how fundamentally our universities depend on the ability of people to travel across borders without undue constraint,” she wrote.
The Harvard International Office sent a message to international students Saturday afternoon warning them about traveling outside the United States.
“All foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the country,” the message reads. The message also asks students who plan to travel outside the United States to enter their travel information in the Harvard Travel Registry.
Morgan reiterated this message and urged any international affiliates whose visas will soon expire to consult an attorney.
Representatives from the Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic will present information and answer questions about the implications of the order at a University-wide town hall Wednesday. In addition, Morgan said the clinic is conducting research for lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the order. She also emphasized the need for activists to put continued political pressure on lawmakers and enforcement officials to rescind the order.
Medical School professor Thomas M. Michel ’77 wrote in an email that Saravi, who was slated to work in his lab, was preparing to travel to Boston to begin research with him when Trump’s order took effect Friday.
“Perhaps the suspension of this young scientist's visa might be viewed as an example of the fundamental inequity of Trump's arbitrary and ill-conceived edict,” Michel wrote.
Soumya Raychaudhuri,  an assistant professor at the Medical School and the head of the laboratory where Asgari was slated to begin work in the next few weeks, said he was considering pursuing legal action to help his student gain entrance to the country.
“I’m obviously very frustrated, very disappointed,” he said. “It’s a huge, huge loss to our institution if this policy holds up.”
Asgari said she believes laws and actions like Trump’s executive order will lead to a world filled with “people who are either hurt or scared.”
“For America as an open welcoming country that has been the image of a land where dreams come true this is a step back,” Asgari wrote.
Looking to the future, Raychaudhuri said he is concerned Trump’s ban on immigration might slow scientific progress in the United States.
“Like many labs at Harvard, we have lots of visa holders and we really take pride in the fact that we can get talent from all over the world,” he said.
“I’m worrying about it in terms of Samira, but I also worry about what it means for science in America,” he added.
Mahmoud Hariri, a doctor from Syria and a participant in the Harvard Scholars at Risk program, said his own ability to travel is relatively uncomplicated, since he does not plan to re-enter the United States after he returns to Syria in June. But he said he and many of his Syrian friends in the United States feel the order has deepened their sense of instability and fear.
“To be honest, it’s just a feeling that you are unstable,” he said. “You know there is a war in our country, and you feel that you don’t have any home anywhere on the Earth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—For a few minutes, it looked like the Harvard men’s basketball team was going to do it again. Just 24 hours after overcoming a double-digit deficit to beat Cornell, the Crimson was down three with seconds to go.
In a season that has been defined by freshmen, it was senior co-captain Siyani Chambers’ turn to play the hero as he stepped up for a three just left of center. The comeback, however, would fall short, as Chambers’ shot clanked off the rim as the buzzer sounded and the near-capacity crowd rose to its feet.
Despite clawing back from a 19-point deficit, the Crimson (11-6, 3-1 Ivy League) dropped its first conference game of the season to Columbia (9-8, 3-1), 65-62.
“We never have doubt in ourselves that we can’t come back in a game,” sophomore guard Corey Johnson said. “Any type of lead we can surmount. We’ve had that mindset throughout.”
If Harvard had won the game, Johnson would have been the one carried out of the gym on his teammates’ shoulders. When Harvard found itself in a seemingly inescapable hole, it was Johnson who brought the team back within striking distance.
Johnson would hit seven threes on the night for a total of 21 points, but the two biggest came when the clock dropped below three minutes in the second frame. With 2:44 remaining, freshman guard Bryce Aiken found Johnson, who used his quick release to get his shot over the hands of the Lions defender. The make pulled Harvard within three, with the score at 62-59. While Columbia’s Mike Smith would respond on the next possession with a layup, Johnson quieted the crowd on a quick three the next time down the floor.
From there, Amaker called a timeout. While the momentum was on his team’s side, the coach wanted to make sure his team got the next stop. Coming out of the timeout, the team had one job—prevent the backdoor cut. Columbia—and Cornell on Friday night—had burned the Crimson with cuts into the paint all night, and Amaker wanted to make sure that didn’t happen in this case.
While the strategy was correct, the execution was flawed. The Lions went right back to the backdoor cut, but Harvard was unable to get the stop. Instead, freshman Seth Towns picked up his fourth foul of the night and sent Columbia to the line.
“No back doors and they come out and get a backdoor,” Amaker said. “Really we’re trying to guard against that.”
Towns was also a main contributor to the comeback, earning his first career double-double with 12 points and 12 rebounds. Towns excelled in taking advantage of the long jumper, finding space in between the defenders who were guarding the three-point shot and the post players preventing the layup. However, the rookie struggled to stretch his shot. While he has shot 37.7 percent from deep on the season, he went 0-for-6 from behind the arc Saturday night.
Harvard outscored Columbia 36-24 in the second frame, but the hole the team dug itself in the first half was too deep to overcome. The Lions shot a blistering 58 percent from three-point range in the first half while Harvard shot a measly 3-of-16 from deep, sending the teams into the locker room with the home team up 15 points.
Not only was Columbia winning the perimeter game, it was winning in the paint as well. A combination of backdoor cuts and effective post play from the Lions’ frontcourt allowed them to outscore the Crimson 16-6 from inside in the first half alone. Harvard freshman Chris Lewis managed only 15 minutes of action as he battled foul trouble early on.
Senior Zena Edosomwan was a bright spot in the game and was a presence in the paint on offense and defense, but as Amaker noted after the game, “we just didn’t have enough”.
“We were waiting until we were down and we’re fighting and scrapping and clawing like we did,” Amaker added. “When we don’t start that way, we get a 15-point deficit at halftime, it’s hard to dig these things out against good teams out the road.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 29, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.
It’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.
This mantra sure was pertinent Friday night when the Harvard men’s hockey team exploded for four goals in the third period to come from behind and knock off Cornell.
But one night after its big finale, the Crimson discovered a little secret. Quality starts aren’t half bad either.
On Saturday, No. 9 Harvard (14-5-2, 10-4-2 ECAC) did all its damage in the first period rather than the third, striking three times in the opening 20 minutes and cruising for the ensuing 40 in a 3-1 victory over Colgate (6-14-5, 4-7-2) at the brand new Class of 1965 Arena.
“I thought we came out very determined, and we were ready to play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think we came out with a purpose. We were determined to get some pucks behind them and use our forecheck to put some pressure on them, turn the puck over, and play fast.”
The Raiders couldn’t handle that purpose in the first, as the Crimson scored early and often.
For the second night in a row, junior Jake Horton put Harvard on the board—this time just two periods sooner. A little more than three minutes following the opening puck drop, Horton grabbed possession of the puck behind the net, turned the corner, and tucked a wrap-around try inside Colgate senior Charlie Finn’s right post.
For the next 57 minutes, the Crimson played with a lead—one that doubled to 2-0 with 5:30 to go in the opening frame.
In an attempt to throw a puck towards goal from the attacking blue line, freshman defenseman Paul Meyer hit Harvard forward Sean Malone’s foot, enabling the senior to collect the puck and walk in alone on Finn. Low in the right faceoff circle, Malone let go of a wrister that bounced off the pipe and in to put Harvard up two.
The visitors scored one last time in the frame’s final minute. Skating on the first power play of the evening for either side, senior Tyler Moy worked his way to the top of the slot, where he beat a screened Finn with a stick-side wrister—good for the Crimson's seventh goal in two periods dating back to Friday and its first score from the man advantage in three games.
“We sort of got back to doing what we were doing that made us successful earlier on in the year,” Malone said. “Things like stopping on pucks, getting pucks deep, and keeping the game simple.”
The Raiders pulled Finn after the period and did get one back with 13:25 remaining in the game when sophomore defenseman Willie Brooks struck in transition on a 4-on-4 stemming from post-whistle extracurriculars between Harvard’s Michael Floodstrand and Colgate’s Ken Citron.
But the Raiders had already missed their golden opportunity. Sophomore defenseman Jacob Olson’s major cross-checking penalty against Mike Panowyk late in the second period gave the hosts five minutes of power-play time to begin climbing out of their 3-0 deficit, but Colgate’s man advantage, which actually ranks in the top half of the ECAC in terms of efficiency, could not execute.
In all, the Crimson blocked six shots over the course of the five-minute major, only allowing two tries to make their way to netminder Merrick Madsen. The junior made 26 saves on the night and now has gone four straight games allowing one goal or less.
“You need your goalie to be your best penalty killer,” uttered Donato as he often does. “I don’t think we relied on him to make a bunch of unbelievable saves, but I thought he was very solid and made things very calm back there.”
Donato chose to roll out the same lines and defensive pairings he finished with against Cornell—ones that bear few similarities to those Harvard has been using throughout the year. The coach said the team will continue searching for “the perfect mix,” but he also provided some rationale for sticking to Friday’s script again on Saturday.
“We’re trying to put the lineup we think that gives us the best chance to win every night,” Donato said. “If someone goes in and plays well and the team is successful, a lot of times we like to stay with the same group. It puts the onus on the players that it’s a meritocracy.”
With the win, the Crimson remains three points off the ECAC lead, which for the time being now belongs to No. 16 St. Lawrence after the Saints topped No. 5 Union on Saturday in Canton, N.Y. Harvard also jumps one spot in the PairWise rankings to eighth—five spots ahead of where it stood at weekend’s start.
GAME NOTES
—Friday night against Cornell, Harvard made a few in-game line adjustments, including the moving of Jake Horton from the second line to the fourth line. Although Saturday’s lineup sheet again listed him as a member of the second unit, he spent the bulk of the night on the fourth line with co-captain Devin Tringale and freshman Ty Pelton-Byce, both of whom he praised after the game. Each of Horton’s goals this weekend were scored with Tringale and Pelton-Byce on the ice.
—Ted Donato also spoke more broadly about his lineup decisions: “We’re fortunate that we have some good depth and we have some guys that can play multiple positions. I don’t think we’re going to be able to survive all the way to the end of the season with just 20 players, so I think we feel certainly that there’s some forwards and defensemen that can be in and out of the lineup.”
—Junior forward Seb Lloyd was listed as an extra forward for pregame skate, but ultimately, he did not crack the lineup. Addressing this, the coach said, “We expect that he along with some others that didn’t play tonight will be important parts of our stretch run.”
—Harvard outshot Colgate, 21-15, through the first two periods, and it narrowly kept a 28-27 edge for the game.
—The Crimson finished 1-for-3 on the power play, while Colgate did nothing with only one man advantage opportunity, although its one chance lasted five minutes.
