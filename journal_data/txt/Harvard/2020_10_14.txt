After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard would love for us to believe that it is doing everything it can to fight sexual assault and harassment. Administrators routinely boast that Harvard employs more than 50 Title IX coordinators and emphasize their immediate opposition to the Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations. Released in May, the change increased the burden of proof and barriers to reporting sexual violence at the federal level, and Harvard seized this opportunity to seem committed to survivors in comparison.
However, Harvard students, especially survivors of sexual violence, know there are major cracks in Harvard’s prevention and response to sexual violence. We see these cracks in the allegations of sexual harassment in the Anthropology and Government departments that were overlooked for years, in the severe understaffing of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and in Harvard’s continued refusal to implement an affirmative consent policy, under which only a clear and continual “yes,” communicated verbally or physically, would count as consent.
As organizers with Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate group of survivors and allies working to dismantle rape culture at Harvard, we are all too familiar with these gaps. We are consistently told that sexual assault is not a Harvard problem, it’s a student culture problem. Administrators have suggested they don’t have a magic wand to just make this go away and love to remind us we all collectively bear the responsibility for community standards — while doing little to fulfill their end of the deal.
Student organizers and survivors are thus forced to bear disproportionate responsibility, with little to no institutional support from administrators in power. We fight tirelessly to make it easier for Harvard to protect us, and in return we are shut out, met with closed-door meetings, murky external reviews, and zero transparency. The real “culture” at Harvard is one of silence and opacity surrounding sexual assault and harassment. If Harvard wants culture change, it must stop putting the onus on students and survivors and be an active participant.
We have worked nonstop to teach Harvard how to do just that. This summer we partnered with dozens of other student organizations to deliver a letter of demands, signed by over 1,000 Harvard affiliates, to the University administration. The letter contained proposals for Title IX policy change in light of the new federal rules, as well as proposals for prevention and increasing transparency.
This letter was the result of the exact kind of community action that Harvard believes is necessary to fight sexual misconduct. We sent it to University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Office for Dispute Resolution Director William D. McCants. But beyond the Title IX office, no other Harvard administrators publicly acknowledged the letter’s existence. We handed Harvard an instruction manual on supporting survivors in the wake of federal overhaul — one formed from active community participation — and they failed to act on it.
While the new policy announced in August did make good on some of the demands, it was conspicuously silent on others. Harvard acted where it was convenient, keeping existing standards, continuing current policies where possible, and adding some protective measures during survivor cross-examination, but it balked at more substantive changes.
Perhaps most notably, unlike many of its peer institutions, the new policy failed to adopt a definition of affirmative consent, despite years of student activism. The new policy’s description of consent is a confusing jumble of words: “agreement, assent, approval or permission.” Each of these descriptors carries a distinct connotation — for example, “agreement” implies mutual decision-making, while “permission” could easily be interpreted as passivity or a lack of resistance. And “assent,” depending on the context, can actually refer to somebody who cannot legally give consent — and the University of Pennsylvania’s policy, for example, differentiates between the two concepts.
The University has also been silent on proposed community changes such as increasing transparency and student input during the drafting of new Title IX policy and increasing funding for OSAPR, which now has only four staff members for the entire institution. A well-funded and fully-staffed OSAPR could provide community-based, trauma-informed, restorative, educational, preventative, and healing resources that serve all members of the community and create a holistic response to harm. But Harvard did not announce the two recent OSAPR departures, including that of Director Pierre R. Berastain Ojeda ’10, nor has it shown any intention of promptly filling the vacancies — effectively downsizing the office without so much as a word.
We wish we could say we were surprised, but Harvard has a long history of responding to the hard work of survivors and advocates with blame displacement, poor communication, and gaslighting. In 2018, administrators refused to allow us to distribute resources on sexual violence to admitted students at Visitas registration, saying it was already an “overwhelming time.” We had to resort to mass emails and Facebook group posts instead. We have also been fighting for affirmative consent since 2012, facing administrators who we felt trivialized the proposal or made it seem unrealistic. Yet this August, Title IX officers were still asking us what kind of standard students want, as if we have not been clarifying this for years.
Time and again, our activism is unreciprocated and met with demands that we do more labor, explain further, or adjust our expectations. We know this is a distraction from the real change that needs to be made.
This year’s required Title IX training module claims: “As a community, it is our responsibility to work together to address sexual harassment.” Yet, when students and survivors do just that — when we spend a summer having difficult conversations, digging through Title IX regulations, and combining our voices into a roadmap for the University — Harvard virtually ignores us.
As the University claims, culture change is a community effort. It will take all of us to address sexual harm and rape culture, and the University must lead the charge. It will take working with students — from Our Harvard members and Anthropology graduate students who are already pouring time and emotional energy, to survivors who are actively offering their labor to make Harvard safer. It will take commitment, investment, and substantive policy change. But unlike what Harvard still seems to think, it won’t take a magic wand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The event planners had everything ready. Nearly the entire guest list had RSVP'd, from big names to friends-of-friends. A few celebrated early in the evening, but then someone very unwelcome came, many started feeling ill, and just like that, Beethoven’s 250th birthday party was ruined.
2020 marked the year 250 A.B. (Anno Beethoveni), and the classical music world had extensive programming slated to celebrate. Nearly every orchestra — amateur and professional — had plans for a special emphasis on Beethoven’s music — symphony cycles, recording projects, or simply more Beethoven than usual; that is, until a global pandemic shuttered these plans.
Some have bemoaned the postponement, and are diligently planning rain dates to properly fete our German muse. But before any grand return to performances, orchestras should take a hard look at their programming, to realize Beethoven is the last composer that needs any extra olive wreaths.
On his 250th birthday, we find Beethoven dead. Do we resuscitate him?
Ludwig van Beethoven, born on December 16, 1770, is classical music’s patron saint. In a field as subjective as music, Beethoven seems to go undisputed as the best composer to ever live. Though he started in Mozart’s shadow, Beethoven’s grander visions and injections of wide-ranging emotion into his work redefined art-music and ushered in a new era — that of the Romantics. His most celebrated works include 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, five piano concertos, a violin concerto, and of course, nine symphonies. A full-time orchestra like the Boston Symphony wouldn’t dream of a season without several pieces in addition to their annual Tanglewood performance of his Ninth Symphony at the end of their summer season.
His music is well-known by even the most casual classical music listener, and his name and figure are pervasive. In Boston alone, his name seems to be in every major music venue. It’s front and center on the proscenium of Harvard’s Paine Hall, flanked by the names of subordinate composers. It’s rumored that when Boston Symphony Hall made plans for a similar display, Beethoven’s name was the only one the committee members could agree upon, so his name stands alone. New England Conservatory is home to an eight-foot-tall bronze statue holding a score of his Ninth.
So, the opportunity to celebrate a quarter millenium of Beethoven was no small matter.
But the pandemic swiftly silenced orchestras around the globe. For the first time, Beethoven’s voice went hoarse as performances across the world (including at Harvard) were canceled en masse. A performance of the Ninth Symphony, his magnum opus, a work whose large orchestra, choir, and vocal soloists celebrate humanity in all its glory, would ironically be just the thing to spread death and disease. We are living in the music world’s nightmare: a Beethoven-less Beethoven anniversary.

Realistically, we will, in fact, resuscitate Beethoven. As soon as choirs are able to practice without a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notice, chronic performances of every Beethoven symphony and concerto are all but certain. The “Ode to Joy,” our soundtrack of choice for humanity’s unity, will likely peal across the world; the year without Beethoven will probably be a brief pause in our continuous veneration.
We are nonetheless presented with an interesting opportunity. In 2020, we suited up to do what classical music does best: celebrate the already-celebrated. While criticism of Beethoven and calls for his deposition are nothing new, it’s worth noting that we’ve taken the first step of weaning ourselves from his custody. We have the opportunity to take a step back, and reevaluate our relationship with Beethoven. His music is exceptionally important for its historical value, but in terms of aesthetics, he is by no means the greatest composer for orchestra. If Beethoven were truly the pinnacle, we would have stopped writing music upon his death in 1827. Thankfully, we did not.
Was it really wise for orchestras to be spending millions on producing yet another CD set of his complete symphonies? Do we really need to spend more advertising dollars promoting the most performed composer of all-time? No. There is great music out there without a commercial recording to do it justice. Making recordings of unrecorded or under-recorded music, new or old, is every orchestra’s responsibility.
With classical music in such decline, especially in America, we desperately need to try something new. More Beethoven is just more of the same. If anything, doubling down on these old ways would only enervate listeners. As some experienced with Leonard Bernstein’s 100 birthday in 2018, too much of a very specific style of music can founder one’s enthusiasm. The novelty of a musical work is so often what makes the concert experience valuable.
Instead, by putting resources into celebrating other anniversaries, like the birthdays of living composers or the anniversaries of other milestone works, we might expand classical music’s influence in today’s culture. In just the next five years, we have the 100th birthdays of a trio of pioneering avant-garde composers György Ligeti, Luciano Berio, and Pierre Boulez, the 200th birthday of Romantic giant Anton Bruckner, the 300th anniversary of J.S. Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos, and the 100th anniversary of George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue.” The energy we could divert from playing Beethoven’s Ninth over and over again to smaller celebrations of these other musical giants has the potential to bring different music to new people, something classical music desperately needs as the industry struggles to generate new followers. Variety, not uniformity, in programming will accomplish this.
Beethoven already enjoys our constant adulation. To be frank, we dodged a bullet this year, as we were risking exhausting ourselves and overspending on wasteful commemoration that wouldn’t further classical music’s cause. Beethoven, we’ll talk again on your 300th.

A panel of activists, academics, and students discussed the role of young voters and the importance of youth voter turnout in the upcoming 2020 presidential election during an online webinar Tuesday.
Hosted by Harvard Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation and the Institute of Politics, the event was moderated by Abby Kiesa, the Director of Impact at Tufts University’s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement.
Dawn Boudwin from the Alliance for Youth Action, Dakota Hall from Leaders Igniting Transformation, Michael Hanmer, a government professor at the University of Maryland, and Justin Y. Tseng ’22 from the Harvard Public Opinion Project served as panelists.
The discussion focused on the marked increase in young voter registration between the 2016 presidential election and the 2018 midterm elections, as well as the substantial power that young voters wield in the upcoming elections this year.
During the event, Kiesa presented polling results from previous elections, noting that young voter turnout exceeded the winning candidate's margin of victory in many states. Hall specifically pointed to Wisconsin, a battleground state where young voters have been shown to hold power.
Kiesa also emphasized the sharp increase in young voter turnout in the recent years. In the 2018 election, for example, CIRCLE surveys showed that young voter turnout increased by double digits in 31 states. Five states saw a young turnout increase of 20 or more percentage points.
Panelists also discussed how recent barriers to voting, including those created by the pandemic, may impact young voter turnout. Despite these barriers, the majority of young voters surveyed by CIRCLE said they felt that the government’s handling of the pandemic has led them to see the importance of voting for their representatives. Seventy-nine percent of young voters polled by CIRCLE said decisions made by their elected representatives impact their everyday life.
Hanmer said his biggest concern regarding young voter turnout in the upcoming 2020 election is the “potential for mistakes.” He added that it will be important for grassroots groups and state authorities alike to keep information about the voting process readily available.
“With so many people that are going to be voting for the first time, and particularly voting by mail for the first time, I think we just need to be careful,” Hanmer said.
Tova A. Wang, a fellow at the Ash Center who helped organize the event, wrote in an email that she thought young voters could “easily determine” the outcome of the election.
“I believe this is the year that young people will make their voices heard about the things they care about in unprecedented numbers,” Wang wrote. “They’ve been showing what a force to be reckoned with they are in the streets and on social media and they know now is the time to take a stand at the ballot box.”

Two scholars analyzed the history of racism in America, the business world, and their own lives to better understand how to overcome problems of race in business in a Harvard Business School webinar Tuesday.
The event was the first of the Business School’s “Managing Diversity” speaker series and featured a conversation between Dean Nitin Nohria and Business Administration professor emeritus James I. Cash, the first Black tenured professor at the Business School.
Cash began by describing his experience growing up in the heavily segregated Jim Crow South, emphasizing the hostility Black people faced in that environment.
“My first conscious thoughts about race were based on hearing preachers use quotes from the Bible to convey why segregation was God's will,” Cash said.
When he went to Texas Christian University with a basketball scholarship, Cash said, the challenges continued.
“When I was at TCU and went to my first game at the University of Arkansas, freshmen couldn't play at that point in time,” Cash said. “I had to have a police escort to get into the gym.”
The conversation eventually shifted to how Cash has used such experiences in the segregated South, at the Business School, and at various companies to seek positive change. He explained that he handles tense situations involving race by assuming “positive intent.”
Cash said he believes white privilege is omnipresent in life and business, likening it to a “tax” constantly levied against African Americans.
“The concept of white privilege has nothing to do with how hard you work.” Cash said. “It instead refers to a mental and emotional burden, or tax that African Americans and other people of color face every day of their lives.”
Several audience members said Cash’s statements struck a chord. Roseanna DeMaria ’97, an alumna of the Business School General Manager program, said she attended the first installment in the webinar because she has been impressed by the Business School’s previous event offerings, adding that Cash’s remarks particularly resonated with her.
“To hear Professor Cash talk with the level of gravitas and humility and optimism, for me, was the greatest takeaway,” DeMaria said.
“You have to act your way into a new way of thinking,” she added, reiterating an idea Cash discussed.
Eric D. Mankin ’86, a Business School graduate and current PPE market development manager at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, called Cash an HBS “legend.”
“James Cash is, of course, just an incredible presence and really a legend in all sorts of ways,” Mankin said. “So any chance one has to get his perspective is a good one.”
Ultimately, Cash said he has seen progress over the course of his life in the fight for racial justice that has left him “optimistic,” but also that he believes change will come slowly.
“It is definitely a long, slow slog, and only moves forward when a critical mass of people, press forward in whatever sphere of influence they have,” Cash said.

Two professors discussed their upcoming book project on the future of anti-corruption initiatives in Latin America Tuesday at an online event with Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
Ezequiel A. González-Ocantos, a professor at the University of Oxford, and Paula Muñoz, a professor at the Universidad del Pacífico in Peru, spoke about their upcoming book, which examines the effects of anti-corruption efforts — with a particular focus on the “Lava Jato” investigation in Brazil — on voter activity and political engagement. The event, titled “The Criminalization of Corruption in Latin America: Causes and Consequences of Lava Jato,” marks the latest installment in the center's "Tuesday Seminar Series.”
González-Ocantos opened the virtual discussion by describing the historical context and academic objectives of their research for the book.
“Our interest in Lava Jato stems perhaps from a broader question: What is the best way to fight corruption?” González-Ocantos said.
González-Ocantos explained that anti-corruption efforts can have varying effects on public opinion: They can either increase or decrease political engagement overall. He also said that some of these initiatives employ aggressive and controversial tactics, which may repel voters.
“In many ways, the prosecutorial zeal that is needed to take on the establishment often also becomes the Achilles heel of these investigations,” he said.
The two professors presented data from case studies conducted in Lima, Peru and Recife, Brazil to demonstrate the tendency of anti-corruption efforts like Lava Jato to either politically inspire or frustrate citizens.
“There’s the optimists who believe that perhaps these crusades can be interpreted by the voters as a sign that the system is capable of disrupting business as usual,” González-Ocantos said. “These are big bangs that dramatize in very clear ways that a country can become politically better.”
Harvard Government professor Alisha C. Holland, who led the panel, and Harvard Government lecturer Frances Hagopian, who moderated the panel, questioned the professors about the specific methodologies used in their research.
In an interview after the event, Muñoz said she hopes their research will draw attention to the political complexities of corruption prosecution.
“It’s very important to send a message that high-level authorities must deal with justice, that they are no different from the rest of citizens, so that is what is at stake here now,” she said.
Following the event, Holland further explained the cultural importance of anti-corruption initiatives. She emphasized that their high-profile nature is a large part of what makes them influential political tools.
“Many times these are televised proceedings and they’re making the nightly news. And so the public at large often ends up consuming these as a sort of soap opera unfolding in the politicized world,” she said.
Holland also noted the parallels of González-Ocantos and Muñoz’s scholarship on anti-corruption efforts to politics in the United States.
“Some of the broader normative questions that were raised today about what those types of prosecutions do to public trust in the political system, and the ways that they can further polarize an electorate, are important to think about in terms of the United States as well,” she said.
The next installment in the seminar series, titled “Democratic Backsliding in Contemporary Latin America,” will take place on Oct. 27.

The University will permanently close its Dental Service and Pharmacy on Dec. 31 due to financial strains.
Harvard University Health Services spokesperson Michael Perry wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the decision is “in no way a reflection of the quality of services delivered or the way these departments are run.” Instead, years-long financial trends spurred the closures.
“Both the Dental Service and Pharmacy have been facing significant financial pressures over the past several years due to forces outside of their control,” Perry wrote. “The Dental Service has struggled to break even, with mixed results.”
“For the Pharmacy, the economics of the pharmacy business have changed over the past several years, making it very difficult for smaller pharmacies to break even or be profitable, and the Pharmacy has not been immune to these changes,” he wrote.
The closure of the Dental Service was first announced in a letter dated Sept. 15 penned by HUHS Chief of Dental Services L. Michele Mardis and HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen. It was sent to patients by mail and posted on the HUHS website.
“We speak for the entire staff in thanking you for all your patronage over the years, both past and present,” Mardis and Nguyen wrote. “Please know that your dental health, moving forward, is of the utmost importance to us.”
The letter states that the Dental Service will provide patients free copies of their dental records upon request, complete pre-paid or currently underway care, and offer consultations for referrals to in-network dental providers through the end of the year.
The University had not previously announced the Pharmacy closure.
Benjamin M. Costa, a dentist at the Service, said news of the clinic’s closure was a “shock” to him and his wife, who have one child and are expecting another.
“With COVID, it just makes it so challenging to potentially travel to other places and make big decisions for your family. It’s just extra challenging,” he said. “I don’t know exactly where I’m going to go yet.”
Costa said he thinks the closing of the Harvard clinic will have the biggest impact on underprivileged students who would not otherwise have access to dental services.
“Where are they going to go for dental care?” he said. “What’s going to happen to the clinic? We would like to know for our patients. And we don’t know.”
Some patients expressed their concerns about the impending loss of services and uncertainty over finding new healthcare providers.
Mary H. Askew ’77 — who worked at Harvard through 2007 — wrote in an email that the Dental Service closing is “quite distressing.”
“I have used the dental service since I began Harvard employment in 1989,” she wrote. “I trust them and I will greatly miss their care.”
“Losing continuity of care when I am now 65 and having to start all over with another dental office during a pandemic is a major inconvenience but more importantly means I have lost continuity of care that took decades to establish,” she added.
Adonica Y. Lui, an alumna of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an email that she has also relied on Harvard’s dental services for decades.
“The wonderful dentists, hygienists, and staff there have taken great care of me. The trust and rapport build up over the years cannot easily be replaced,” she wrote. “I don’t know yet what I’m going to do now that the clinic will be closed for good in December. I cannot make any appointments to see either my dentist or hygienist now.”
Costa said support from HUHS ahead of the closure, including a severance package for both providers and ancillary staff, has been “extremely generous.” Still, he said he is “sad to see it go.”
“It was such an opportunity to work at Harvard and it was such a wonderful clinic,” he said. “I certainly will personally miss all of my patients deeply, and the University and the community that I served in.”
“It was just such a wonderful thing,” he said.

While Harvard’s endowment returns for the 2020 fiscal year were promising, experts warn that the endowment could face challenges down the line.
Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced in September that Harvard’s endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments in 2020, totaling $41.9 billion dollars, the largest sum in its history.
Charlie Eaton, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California Merced who researches financial inequality and higher education financial administration, wrote in an email that the strong endowment returns diverged from the ongoing pandemic-induced unemployment crisis and the “economic misfortunes of everyday people.”
“Harvard’s endowment growth parallels increasing valuations of equities like stocks despite turmoil in the broader economy, especially for low-wage workers,” Eaton wrote.
Eaton added that the strong returns could enable the University to avoid layoffs and payment cuts for its essential employees. A student activist campaign in the spring dubbed #40BillionforWhat called on the University to use endowment funds to shield employees from the consequences of the pandemic.
“The returns also give Harvard the means to continue increasing its undergraduate enrollments and enroll more low-income students,” Eaton wrote. “This is even more important as state budget cuts are decimating public universities that low-income students disproportionately rely on.”
Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced in June that Harvard would not pursue layoffs or furloughs at the time because of “uncertainty” regarding the fall semester. The University had previously floated the idea, sparking criticism from affiliates.
Despite the record-setting returns, the University still anticipates taking a financial hit from the pandemic. Harvard administrators have projected that the University will face a $750 million revenue shortfall in the coming fiscal year. In an interview with The Crimson last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow disclosed that Harvard has incurred “tens of millions” of dollars in COVID-19 testing expenses alone.
Timothy J. Keating ‘85, the president of Keating Wealth Management, wrote in an email that the endowment’s performance was “reasonable” relative to its Ivy League competitors. However, Keating noted that the endowment’s performance over the past 5 to ten years has been “disappointing.”
Thomas D. Parker ‘64, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, wrote that the endowment returns were “quite good” given national norms of 2 to 3 percent returns. He added that they were “not bad” compared to other Ivy League results.
“Ranking endowment returns is like University rankings in general. They are entertaining and we all read them, but they really don't tell us much about real performance over time,” Parker wrote in an email.
Keating questioned whether active endowment management would ultimately be a positive strategy for the University, as opposed to a more “passive” investment approach.
“Over time, the real question for Harvard—and for all $1 billion+ endowments—is whether active management can add value relatively to a passively managed and appropriate benchmark (such as 60% stocks/40% bonds, for example),” Keating wrote in the email. “In that regard, the jury is still out.”
Narvekar wrote in a 2019 report that HMC was “not pleased” with the performance that year, when the endowment returned 6.5 percent. He noted at the time that the endowment was in the midst of a “significant restructuring.”
“While some changes will take years to have an impact — and we are keenly aware that we are in a marathon and not a sprint — we can already detect positive indicators of progress,” Narvekar wrote in 2019.
Parker wrote that the endowment’s restructuring plan appeared to be “on course,” but cautioned against determining “failure or success” on annual performance numbers.
He said the endowment had fulfilled its intended purpose for the year: to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on Harvard’s finances.
“The important thing is that there was enough growth to justify the temporary increases in the draw on endowment to supplement expenses in the fact of pandemic budget problems. If the substantial decline in revenues which the University is experiencing continues for too long, the drain on endowment could outpace growth,” he wrote. “So far that hasn't happened.”

Harvard Management Company plans to sell an Australian farming portfolio worth $120 million, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review.
The Western Rosella Farming portfolio is located in Australia’s Lachlan Valley and covers nearly 13,652 acres of land. The portfolio is composed of resources including almond orchards, irrigated row cropping, and livestock grazing.
HMC made a similar sale in January 2020, offloading investments in a cotton farm and almond farm in New South Wales to the Boston-based Hancock Agricultural Investment Group.
HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced last month that the endowment earned 7.3 percent returns in the 2020 fiscal year, reaching a value of $41.9 billion dollars. The endowment is now at its highest-ever value.
Harvard’s worldwide farmland investments have previously come under fire for their environmental impact.
On Thursday, Narvekar announced that the Company's natural resources team, which has long struggled with low returns on its investments, would “spin out” to become an independent investment firm. Narvekar suggested that the move would allow HMC to retain exposure to more desirable investments while limiting its overall exposure to natural resources.
In a 2019 financial report, Narvekar announced that HMC returned a negative 12.4 percent on its natural resources investments, compared to 6.5 percent returns on the overall endowment.
In the report, Narvekar wrote that HMC was seeking to limit its exposure to natural resources by selling “deeply troubled assets” and “good, but misaligned assets” that did not offer an appropriate risk-return-liquidity profile for the endowment.
Danny Thomas, a regional director at CBRE, a real estate company, who is overseeing the sale, said in an interview with the Australian Financial Review that the farming portfolio would be a valuable asset for investors.
“The portfolio offers an excellent agricultural offering for the region, that will be of interest to investors, both domestic and international," Thomas said.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the sale, citing HMC’s policy not to comment on specific investments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
COVID-19 has disrupted all aspects of Harvard life — including the efforts of the College’s most prestigious social groups to induct hopeful sophomores.
This semester, twelve final clubs on campus are not holding punch — the process by which final clubs recruit students each fall — due to the global health crisis, according to members of each club, who spoke with The Crimson on the condition of anonymity to divulge internal decisions.
The clubs not moving forward with punch include the Bee Club, the Spee Club, the IC Club, the Delphic Club, the Fly Club, the Owl Club, the Porcellian Club, the Phoenix S.K. Club, the Fox Club, the Sab Club, La Vie Club, and the Exister Society.
The Crimson was unable to confirm the punch plans of the A.D. Club and the Pleiades Society — the only other two final clubs on campus.
Serena G. Pellegrino ’23, who said she would be open to joining a final club, said she supported clubs’ decisions to not hold punch remotely.
“I think it’s really something that has to be done in person, just because it’s really about how you fit in and can be with others and relate to others,” she said. “I don’t think you can really achieve that over Zoom or anything virtual really, because it’s really about being social and about being with people.”
Pellegrino also said she believes delaying punch until everyone is back on campus is a more equitable solution than trying to hold smaller punch events off campus — while students are scattered across the world. She currently resides in Florence, Italy.
“People with different circumstances can’t meet or choose not to,” she said.
Ray Chen ’23, who said he is not interested in joining a final club, said he thinks clubs made the “responsible” choice by pausing in-person recruitment.
Still, Chen said he has questions about how delaying punch will impact future students.
“What does that mean for next year? Does it mean that we will see juniors getting punched that would have been? Will the freshmen feel any more inclined, so that like, ‘Oh, what is this thing — maybe there’s social opportunity — seeing as social opportunities are rare,’’ he said. “Or conversely, maybe freshmen don’t really know about what are these final clubs — like actually what the culture is like.”
While the coronavirus may put clubs’ recruitment plans on pause, they could experience renewed popularity once the College invites socialization-starved students to campus.
The University rolled back its policy targeting members of single-gender organizations at the end of June. The sanctions, which first applied to the Class of 2021, barred members from a host of leadership positions on campus and fellowships.
After the University changed its policy, The Crimson reported that 11 percent of incoming freshmen said they are “very interested” in joining a final club, sorority, or fraternity. That percentage marks more than double the proportion who reported so in the previous class.
Correction: October 14, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly named the Sabliere Society. In fact, the group changed its name in 2017 to the Sab Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 14, 2020, at 10:08 a.m.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science Claudine Gay said in an interview Friday that she does not believe Charles A. Murray's '65 work has academic merit amid controversy surrounding Murray’s upcoming invitation to speak in a course in her former department.
Government preceptor David D. Kane invited Murray to speak in an optional lecture series for his course Government 50: “Data,” which is scheduled for Friday. Murray is best known for his 1994 book “The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,” which advanced widely discredited claims that there are differences in intelligence between classes partially attributable to race and ethnicity. Harvard students and faculty protested Murray’s talk the last time he spoke on campus.
Asked whether she believes Murray’s work has academic merit, Gay said she does not.
“No, I don’t, actually,” Gay said. “I don’t look to Charles Murray as an exemplar of rigorous data science.”
Several other faculty have also said they do not support Murray’s work. Statistics professor Joseph K. Blitzstein wrote to concentrators that he believes “Murray represents racist pseudoscience, not the ideals of data science.” The Computer Science undergraduate advising team wrote to concentrators that they believe Murray is “known not for any contributions to data science, but rather for his and others' use of pseudo-scientific work to justify a racist agenda.”
Murray wrote in an email that he would not respond to unsupported allegations.
“It’s really simple: Ask those who make that charge to give you a direct quote from anything I’ve written or said that backs up the allegation against me,” Murray wrote. “I’ll comment on the record regarding any direct quote. I won’t respond to unsupported allegations. Nor should anyone ever.”
“I’ll respond to anything they say I’ve done that warrants their allegations,” he added.
After The Crimson reported Kane’s speaking invitation to Murray, students alleged Kane made racist posts on his blog under a pseudonym and called for Kane’s removal in a petition that garnered nearly 700 signatures from Harvard students, alumni, and organizations. Government chair Jeffry A. Frieden and divisional Dean of Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo announced in an Oct. 2 email that professor Kosuke Imai will take over as the official head of Gov 50, though Kane will also continue teaching.
Kane did not respond to multiple previous requests for comment from The Crimson on the allegations.
Gay said she supports the Government department’s commitment to academic continuity, academic freedom, and mutual respect.
“I’m aware that the chair of the Government department has heard concerns regarding Gov 50 and has implemented a whole series of interventions that are consistent with their academic practices to ensure academic continuity for the students who are in the course and have been impacted by the events of the last couple of weeks,” Gay said. “I fully support the department's commitment to fulfilling its educational obligations to our students, while also upholding core institutional values regarding academic freedom and expectations of mutual respect.”
Asked whether she thinks the Government can do more to help students feel they belong, Gay said she thinks there is work to be done across the board.
“I think we can all, as a community, continue to do better to really live into our values and our commitment to inclusion and inclusive excellence,” Gay said. “I think there is work that can happen across the board.”
Gay added that she is “delighted” Sheree Owen will serve as the FAS’s inaugural Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to help FAS achieve those goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s police department completed the fact-finding phase of an internal review launched in response to reports of racism and sexism within the force at the end of August, University officials said.
The internal review is one of two ongoing investigations into the Harvard University Police Department launched in the past year.
HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, who is scheduled to retire by the end of 2020, set the project in motion in February in response to an investigation by The Crimson that found repeated instances of racism and sexism within his department. The story cited more than 20 current and former officers who said they believe Riley has led a workplace culture rife with favoritism, and has retaliated against officers who expressed their concerns.
Riley, 74, has helmed HUPD for a quarter-century. He previously served as a lieutenant colonel in the Massachusetts State Police.
When he announced the review back in February, Riley selected a group of employees inside the department to gather information about HUPD’s culture and dealings with the University more broadly. According to an internal email the chief sent to department members at the time, the working group would report to him and University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp. Harvard also engaged two outside law enforcement experts with experience at the United States Department of Justice to oversee it.
Though Riley ordered the working group to complete its assignment by the end of the spring semester, the coronavirus pandemic derailed that timeline.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed in an email to The Crimson earlier this month that the employees involved in the review concluded their work and recently submitted a report to the chief, Lapp, and the two police experts — Ronald L. Davis and Brenda J. Bond-Fortier. Members of the department have yet to receive a copy of the review, however.
“The HUPD internal working group met with community members remotely throughout the summer and has submitted their report to Chief Riley, who is reviewing it along with EVP Katie Lapp,” Swain wrote. “This leadership review includes identifying recommendations that may be acted on in the near term.”
Swain declined to specify with whom the working group met or when its findings would be shared with officers in the department.
Since it launched, some officers in the department said they worried the review would not adequately address internal concerns.
The leadership of Harvard’s police union told The Crimson in March they did not trust the review because department leadership is overseeing it.
Six HUPD employees who spoke with The Crimson this week on the condition of anonymity said they did not speak with the working group. They said they declined to do so because they do not believe an internal review committee can hold department leaders accountable.
During the course of Riley’s 25-year tenure, four assessments of HUPD have taken place. The officers said they believe the current investigation will similarly fail to bring about lasting change.
Since Riley launched the internal review, HUPD has come under further scrutiny for its policing.
A March investigation by The Crimson found three separate allegations of police brutality leveled at HUPD officer Anthony T. Carvello, who used physical force while arresting three Black homeless men in a University common space open to the public.
In June, HUPD officers assisted the Boston Police Department in monitoring a Black Lives Matter protest in Boston following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. Harvard affiliates reacted to HUPD’s presence at the event with outrage.
The following week, Riley announced that he would retire and University President Lawrence S. Bacow set in motion an additional review of HUPD to evaluate its policing procedures, this one run by Davis and Bond-Fortier, the external experts attached to the internal review. A nationwide search for Harvard’s next police chief is ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael Maltzan, a Los Angeles-based architect who has designed low-income housing with the Skid Row Housing Trust for over a decade, challenged students to build quality housing for the homeless in a lecture hosted by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies Tuesday night.
The virtual seminar, which was attended by about 750 people, was moderated by Harvard Graduate School of Design Dean Sarah M. Whiting. Maltzan, an alumnus of the Graduate School of Design, appeared alongside Los Angeles-based housing advocates Michael Alvidrez and Helen Leung to discuss how architecture can address the affordable housing crisis.
During the lecture, Maltzan said it is important to be “realistic” about architecture’s ability to effect change but also to recognize its potential to bring about social progress.
“Homelessness has many causes and many faces — there is not a one-size-fits-all solution,” he said. “Trying to confront the scale of the problem simply with one type or approach to building has historically failed for the individual, the community, and our cities.”
According to the 2020 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, over 66,000 people currently experience homelessness in Los Angeles County, representing a 12.7 percent increase from 2019.
Maltzan has designed four housing projects with the Trust — Rainbow Apartments, New Carver Apartments, Star Apartments, and Crest Apartments. Alvidrez said many of these projects were named after Skid Row buildings that had been destroyed, signifying not only their replacement but also their improvement.
“It’s not uncommon for architects who have worked with the process of affordable housing to do one project and then subsequently say ‘Thank you, that was a lot of fun, but we’re done,’” Maltzan said. “For me, though, it was important to build on what we just learned from the ‘failures’ we grappled with.”
He also stressed the importance of taking these housing developments beyond Skid Row. Crest Apartments, for example, is located in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Van Nuys, which was chosen due to its status as a center of the homeless veteran population, the target for this development.
“The location speaks to the Housing Trust’s ambition to continue to meet those populations close to where they are, as opposed to centralizing the homeless population in one small area of the city,” Maltzan said.
Wednesday’s seminar marked the 20th Annual John T. Dunlop Lecture sponsored by the JCHS, a collaboration between the Graduate School of Design and the Harvard Kennedy School.
Dunlop, a former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, advised several U.S. presidents — from Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, to Bill J. Clinton — on labor management and served as Secretary of Labor under Gerald R. Ford. Dunlop supported and guided the JCHS from its founding in 1959 until his death in 2003.
Both Whiting and JCHS Managing Director Christopher E. Herbert emphasized the need to continue conversations about affordable housing across the country.
“We only scratched the surface, I think,” Herbert said in an interview after the event.
Herbert added that he hopes students at the Graduate School of Design are inspired by the lecture to pursue affordable housing development in their careers.
“After Carver Apartments was built, we heard a lot of criticism that went something along the lines of ‘Why would you build something so nice for those people?’” Maltzan said at the end of his remarks. “The question, then, for architecture is not, ‘How can we build something so nice for them?’ but rather ‘How can we not?’”

Zoom has replaced classrooms and social gatherings, but freshmen can still have many safe and memorable moments in Cambridge. Here are a few tips from Flyby to make the most out of your fall semester!
Stargaze on the Quad lawn.
With the weather starting to get chilly, grab one of the last opportunities to be able to stay outside for more than ten minutes at a time. This is a great activity to experience both solo and with a friend. If lying on the grass in the dark in the fall weather is still too unbearable for you, then wait for a sunny afternoon, lay out a jacket, and bask in the sun.
Catch a sunrise on the Weeks Bridge.
We’re so lucky to have the Charles River in our backyard, and it’s especially gorgeous when the sun starts to peek out for the day. The Weeks Bridge is a prime spot to not only get the perfect Instagram photo but also to simply enjoy nature. However, if the thought of waking up at 6 a.m. sounds absolutely atrocious, the sunset is just as stunning.
Get takeout at a Harvard Square restaurant you have never tried before.
Not only is it good to have non-dhall food every once in a while, but many upperclassmen are also begging you to keep their beloved eating places in business. Order a Hawaiian ahi classic from Pokéworks, taste the crispy salted pepper shrimp from Hong Kong, or devour a Mexican bowl from El Jefe’s. The food scene in Cambridge is pretty diverse, so grab a buddy or two and search for your new favorite restaurant.
Study at a graduate school.
Whether it is in the front lawn of the Harvard Law School Library or Harvard Business School, step out of your suite and get some assignments done at a graduate school. They are peaceful, beautiful places to be productive, and maybe they’ll be your new go-to study spot. Another perk is that you’ll have a smaller chance of running into someone you know, because as much as you love catching up with your peers, you gotta turn that pset in.
Try clam chowder from Quincy Market.
One of the best things about living in the greater Boston area is that almost every location is accessible by public transportation, and Quincy Market is no exception. Quincy Market is a seemingly endless hallway of palatable options, but of all the different kinds of food they have to offer, there is nothing like a classic New England clam chowder. While you’re there, shop around at the stores and street vendor carts too.
Take photos.
A picture is worth a thousand words. Whether your phone captures the changing colors of the leaves in Harvard Yard or your suitemate eating Doritos while laughing at 2 a.m., years from now you will cherish these snapshots. Bonus points if you send them to your family.
While upperclassmen are not physically on campus to pave the way, we hope that Flyby has provided you with a start. Challenge the people in your entryway to see how many people can complete this checklist!

Autumn has arrived in Cambridge, and we’ve got good news and bad news for all you freshmen currently living on campus. The good news: leaves changing color in the Yard! Apple cider donuts! All the pumpkin spiced lattes you could ever hope to drink! The bad news: autumn on campus is more like a soft intro to winter, and it’s about to get cold. Before everyone goes into dorm room hibernation, there’s no better time to (safely) take advantage of some great outdoor spots around campus. Who knows, maybe you’ll even find your new favorite outdoor study spot besides Widener steps!
For the Foodies: Science Center Plaza
Located conveniently next to the Yard, the Science Center Plaza is the place to be if you want to mix it up from your regular diet of dhall microwaveable meals. With a rotating cycle of food trucks every day from waffles to curry and everything in between, there are plenty of options to satisfy literally any craving. Check out the schedule here!
For the Studious: Schwartz Common and Pavilion
I wish I could accurately express in words my love for this outdoor must-do, but please. Just go. Only a short walk over the river to the Business School, the Schwartz Common and Pavilion is the perfect study spot when you want to “get away” from campus without actually ever leaving. It has tons of seating, and the pavilion fire pit will keep you cozy even as temperatures start dropping the moment the sun sets.
For the Peaceful: Harvard Divinity School Labyrinth & Contemplative Garden
Your first semester at college can be a stressful time, even in a normal year…now add in countless hours spent on Zoom, a dash of complete uncertainty about the future, and a pinch of limited social interaction, and it’s enough to leave anyone overwhelmed. For those hoping to find a true hidden gem away from the noise of Harvard Square, the Divinity School’s labyrinth and contemplative garden offers a peaceful setting for your next self-reflection (or quarter-life crisis, we won’t judge either way).
For the ~Vibes~: Winthrop Park
While not technically “on campus,” Winthrop Park is located close enough to all of our favorite staples (*cough cough* Jefe’s) to be included on this list. It may be small, but it undoubtedly passes the vibe check for an ideal outdoor spot. Live music? Check. Plenty of seating? Check. Adorable multicolored lights? Check! Whether it’s a socially-distanced picnic with friends or doing some solo people-watching, this tiny gem really does have it all.
For the Adventurous: Quad Lawn
Okay let’s be real, it’s not actually that far. But if you want to amaze your friends living in the Yard with a heroic journey to a new outdoor space a whole 13-minute walk away, the Quad Lawn is your destination. Featuring plenty of space for social distancing, lots of sun (for now) for those perfect golden hour selfies, and the chance to walk through Cambridge Common (two outdoor spots for the price of one!), you really can’t go wrong with this classic. Maybe you’ll even meet some Quadlings making the trek back home!
The warm-ish weather might not last forever, but your opportunities for the perfect outdoor spot around campus really are endless. If this isn’t enough to convince you to broaden your horizons beyond the Weeks Bridge (oop), the Harvard Outing Club has compiled their own Cambridge Outdoor Guide to help you find even more outdoor must-do’s to help you explore while staying COVID-free!

Kind of like how nobody remembers hearing “Mr. Brightside” for the first time, Harvard students seem to just somehow know the three unofficial graduation requirements. Unfortunately, all three are kind of (read: definitely) not compatible with current on-campus restrictions/remote learning life. Read on for ways to check off the time-honored bucket list in a coronavirus world.
The Scream
Nothing like a twice-yearly nude stampede to liven up Harvard Yard! In the old days, stressed students would sprint the Yard while screaming the anxiety away in a pre-Finals Week cathartic ritual known as Primal Scream. It’s kind of hard to imagine a socially-distant version of the Scream, but the traditions demand completion. It’s time to channel your inner cryptid and streak through the night in the streets of your choice. 2020 is weird enough already, so the chances that you’ll get questioned are probably pretty low, but that being said, stay in line with local policies regarding nudity, and keep everything consensual. And, if you wear a mask, it does double-duty as a coronavirus precaution and disguise!
The Statue
John Harvard’s suspiciously shiny foot has been looking pretty lonely since March. Unfortunately, the Statue’s tradition isn’t the most…considerate…of public health, even in non-pandemic conditions. Since we can’t advocate for public urination (it’s illegal in every state), we encourage you to find more sanitary ways to interact with J. Harv’s foot (an offering of hand sanitizer for the still clueless tourists? Mistletoe hung from the foot?). Whatever you do, just try to keep bodily fluids out of it.
The Stacks
Not gonna lie, the tradition of getting steamy in the depths of Widener is going to be pretty hard to recreate when the iconic library is closed. Not to mention that there’s really not a way to socially-distance during this tradition — but you can keep your mask on and follow NYC’s advice in “getting creative” with positions (or keeping it a solo act). If you’re determined to ~satisfy~ this requirement, try recreating the crypt-like atmosphere of Widener by spreading a fine layer of dust on every surface, blacking out all sources of light, and putting on an hour of page turning and writing ASMR.
...Or Just Wait It Out
Honestly, not many people check every box their first year (if at all!). Consider a global pandemic your permission to procrastinate on the Big Three and wait it out. You’ve got a lot of years for things to calm down and really get a shot at the full experience, and if we’re still living in this reality by your senior year, then you’re in the same spot as before.
However you choose to tackle (or not tackle) the traditions, be safe! No amount of Harvard pseudo-clout is worth getting or spreading the virus. That said, get creative and go ham.
