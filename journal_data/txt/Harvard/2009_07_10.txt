After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JERUSALEM, Israel — Even though they get together and smile for the camera from time to time, France and Israel don’t like each other very much.
The reasons for the tension between these two democracies are too numerous to count and too deeply rooted to understand in their entirety. But the most obvious is probably that France, frequently an outspoken critic of Israel, is home to a left-wing that, as the voice of one of Europe’s largest Arab and Muslim populations, is historically anti-Zionist. 
 Israel, on the other hand, is, um, pro-Zionist. 
And then there are the unsettling vignettes that have further tested the already strained relationship in recent years, such as when the late French Ambassador to the U.K. Daniel Bernard referred to Israel as that “shitty little country,” when eyebrows were raised in the French political establishment over President Nicolas Sarkozy’s part-Jewish heritage, and when, as recently as 2007, more than 7,000 French Jews requested asylum in the United States to escape the violent anti-Semitism they encountered in their home country.  
Of course, all of this says nothing of the terrible treatment Jews have endured in France throughout history: They were expelled no fewer than three times during the Middle Ages, alienated during the public humiliation of the Dreyfus Affair, and handed over to the Nazis by the Vichy government during the German Occupation.
It should come as no surprise, then, that most Israelis have been up in arms ever since Sarkozy, the leader of a country historically hostile to Jews and currently critical of the Jewish state, demanded that their leader, the intrepid Benjamin Netanyahu, fire their Foreign Minister, the highly controversial Avigdor Leiberman. They have a point. After all, who is France to tell them—or, for that matter, anyone—what to do? For a president of one democracy to meddle in the internal affairs of another reeks of arrogance, especially—I’m sorry to say—French arrogance, the same sort of self-proclaimed moral superiority that characterizes the world’s stereotype of France. 
But in this particular case, there is substance behind the arrogance, and Sarkozy is right. If Israel is ever to have any conclusive peace agreement with its neighbors—or even ease the tension that exists within its own borders, among its own people—Leiberman must go. No questions asked. 
For this man to serve as the international face of Israel—a country already struggling to reform its image in the Middle East and the world—is nothing short of a disaster waiting to happen. On his very first day as Netanyahu’s Foreign Minister, Leiberman announced publicly that “those who want peace should prepare for war” and then went on to say that Israel was in no way bound to the agreements reached at the 2007 Israeli-Palestinian peace conference. I don’t know about you, but I can’t think of a better tone to set for the peace process: This way, the Palestinians will simply feel too irate even to notice the Israeli troops marching in to recapture the West Bank. 
But it’s not just in dealing with its neighbors that Leiberman could potentially damage his country. His tour de force might just be his proposed plan to deal with Arabs who live within Israel’s borders and who are citizens of the state. Of course, one could argue that the most fundamentally dangerous thing about Leiberman is that he even has a proposal to deal with Israel’s Arab citizens in the first place, but the proposal itself, with its overtly racist content, takes the cake, hands down. 
To rid Israel of the majority of the nearly one million Arabs living within its borders, Leiberman suggests returning the heavily Arab-populated areas in Israel to the Palestinian authorities in exchange for Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where he himself lives. This way, Israel can simply rid itself of the cultural diversity that has for so long made it an example to other nations faced with similar situations. And for those Arabs still brave enough to live in Israel after that, Leiberman has presented a loyalty oath, which would require every Israeli to accept Israel as a Jewish democratic state, to serve in the military for a certain period of time, and to accept absolutely the symbols of the state. Those who don’t sign the oath simply wouldn’t be able to vote, and the remaining Arab population of Israel would be downgraded from citizens to mere residents, disenfranchised in the Middle East’s only democracy. 
Israel has expressed a desire for peace, most recently with Netanyahu’s (albeit conditional) acceptance of the idea of an autonomous Palestinian state. But how can it realistically expect to achieve any peace at all with a man like Lieberman in the all-too-important position of foreign minister? 
It might be presumptuous of France to tell another country how to run its internal affairs, but the truth is that more world governments—i.e., the ones to whom Israel will actually listen—must join Sarkozy’s call, before the effects of one man and his tenure dash the efforts of an entire nation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lowell House Resident Dean Ryan M. Spoering stepped down from his position last week to become Harvard's Director of Undergraduate Laboratories, according to Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck. Brett Flehinger, a former preceptor in Harvard’s Expository Writing department, has been picked as the new resident dean.
Spoering, a lecturer in the Chemistry department, spent six years in the Lowell community, including the last four as resident dean. Eck said that Spoering and his wife, Amy, started off in Lowell as chemistry tutors, where he “had a soft-spoken but very active manner.” She said that during the previous resident dean search, she had lobbied for Spoering, who came across "as someone with a very good head on his shoulders and a deep inner compass.”
The news of Spoering's departure comes shortly after Cabot House announced on June 1 that writing tutor Jill Constantino would replace Mya M. Mangawang as resident dean there. Mangawang stepped down abruptly in May after holding the position for only a year.
Eck said that Spoering has "done just a marvelous job” as resident dean. She said he led Lowell’s corps of tutors, made hospital visits in the middle of the night, and made an effort to know every student. Several other Lowellians interviewed by The Crimson this week said that they were sad to see him go.
Elizabeth G. Terry, the Lowell House administrator, worked with Spoering throughout his time as tutor and dean and described him as “compassionate and judicious."
“He created an atmosphere of trust and calm, and is a terrific collaborator,” Terry said. 
Anthony R. Britt '10, who worked with Spoering in his time on the House Committee and Undergraduate Council, said that Spoering is “always smiling and very approachable.” Britt recalled that one time, he e-mailed Spoering the night before cross-registration paperwork was due for courses at the Kennedy and Divinity Schools, and Spoering worked with him very early the next morning to meet the deadline.
In an interview, Spoering said that he and his family already miss the Lowell community, but that he is planning to remain a member of the Lowell senior common room.
The search for a new resident dean was initiated after Spoering decided to accept the position of Director of Undergraduate Laboratories, Eck said, and was conducted by Assistant Dean of Residential Life Catherine Shapiro, along with Eck, Co-House Master Dorothy A. Austin, Spoering, and other members of the Lowell senior staff.
Flehinger said in an interview with the Crimson that he had been interested in the position for some time, but that he finally decided to apply after a discussion with one of his students this past year about community at Harvard.
“Lowell seemed like a unique opportunity to have both a social and academic community rolled together,” Flehinger said, adding that he would seek to forge “long-term, durable relationships with students.” Eck said she recognized that intention during the interview process, noting that Flehinger saw the position as a vocation, rather than something he would do for a year or two.
Flehinger received his bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley and earned a Ph.D. in History from Harvard in 1997. He has taught Expository Writing at Harvard since fall 2006, and served as a lecturer and assistant director of undergraduate studies in the history department.
Come fall, Lowell will be home to Flehinger and his family, which includes his wife, Suzanne; a son, soon to be 11; and Jacques Derridag—a chiwawa and corgi mix named after the deceased French philosopher Jacques Derrida. He also has a 21-year-old son at Skidmore College, whom Eck says could give Flehinger additional expertise in relating to students' needs.
Flehinger received Harvard’s Levenson Award for outstanding teaching in 2001, an honor that Eck said stood out during the resident dean application process and showed that he had a "strong and vibrant" connection with students. Eric C. LeMay, the former Head Preceptor in the Expository Writing Department, said he shared an office with Flehinger, who was "enthusiastic and energetic to the marrow."
And students who took Flehinger’s course Expository Writing 20, "Democracy in America," this past spring echoed those sentiments.
"[Flehinger] creates a classroom environment that is fiercely intellectual, yet casual and familiar at the same time," said Maxwell L. Meyer '12. "Lowell House should be celebrating his arrival."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many of his critics and contemporaries, Robert S. McNamara will forever and singularly be known as the supremely rational and self-confident defense secretary who irreparably plunged the United States into the Vietnam War, even while believing that the conflict was not winnable.
But at Harvard, where McNamara enjoyed a brief stint as a Business School professor and later often returned to expound on the lessons learned from his own failures, colleagues reflecting on his death earlier this week pointed to a more nuanced legacy—that of a tragic, repentant, and even admirable man.
"I think one of the most interesting things about Robert McNamara was that he was someone who was a larger-than-life figure in the early '60s, who then continued to learn and grow and change in all kinds of ways," said David T. Ellwood '75, dean of the Kennedy School, where McNamara frequently visited and spoke after he left the Pentagon and the World Bank. "[He was] someone whose ideas were always well-considered...and who ultimately had been through a great deal, but I think in the end came to great wisdom and insight from his many experiences."
McNamara, who endowed a Kennedy School lecture series entitled The Robert McNamara Lecture on War and Peace, died on Monday at age 93 at his home in Washington. He served as defense secretary for Presidents John F. Kennedy '40 and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 to 1968, during which half a million American soldiers were sent to war in the jungles of Vietnam and hundreds of thousands of tons of bombs were dropped. While McNamara had said early on that he was "pleased to be identified" with the war, his confidence in the military effort steadily deteriorated, albeit not publicly until near the end of his tenure.
By 1966, he was privately urging Johnson to establish troop level ceilings and to halt the bombings, which McNamara had come to believe were futile. In 1967, he pressed Johnson more firmly to consider a peace settlement. Johnson, believing that McNamara was aiding a presidential bid by Robert F. Kennedy '48, announced in Nov. 1967 that McNamara would be stepping down as defense secretary to head the World Bank.
"When [McNamara] left, he was already a very sick, disheartened, and dispirited person, so much so that at his last news conference...he broke down in tears, in front of the President and the cameras," said Marvin L. Kalb, a Kennedy School professor who, as a former journalist, knew McNamara personally. "It was a sad thing to observe, for somebody who was so confident that he knew how to run the war, to leave in tears and in full awareness that he had failed."
For much of his early life, McNamara was defined by his striking intellectualism, his tireless focus and drive, and his seeming lack of personal warmth and humanity.
"In the Kennedy years, he was almost perfect in his hard work and insightfulness. He was very, very sharp...but he lacked that human touch, he didn't acknowledge things that didn't come out of numerical displays," said Paul M. Doty, a member of President Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee and the founder of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, with which McNamara had been closely affiliated for several years. "Later on, when he got into his repentance period, he became a softer and more gentle person. But he was very interesting to talk to all the way along."
After leaving the Pentagon, McNamara spent 13 years tackling global poverty as the World Bank's president, exhibiting his characteristic devotion and confidence but delivering mixed results. He became heavily involved with efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation, and he spoke and traveled widely in his later life denouncing America's role and his own role in Vietnam. He even wrote a memoir indicting American policy in Vietnam and was featured in the acclaimed documentary, "The Fog of War."
But despite these efforts and his attempts to share the lessons that he had learned in office, some continue to feel that McNamara ought to have denounced more forcefully and publicly the war while he was in power. His failure to do so and his failure to save thousands of American lives, critics argue, can never be compensated for.
"To me, the tragic flaw was that Robert McNamara was someone who was incapable of imagining that he could be wrong. The mistakes in Vietnam were mistakes of arrogance and addiction to power," said Stephen M. Walt, a Kennedy School professor who added that he was "certainly no admirer of [McNamara's]."
"Despite his many failures, he always appeared to be 100 percent certain that his own ideas were always right," Walt said. "One would have thought that experience would have taught him a bit of humility, but if it ever came to him, it came very late. There was a tendency to constantly be prescribing advice, and it would have been easier to take if the track record had been more successful."
Kalb, the former reporter, said that even McNamara himself likely did not believe that his post-war actions could serve sufficient penitence for his mistakes.
"I think he realized deep down that he is going to be remembered in history for his unfortunate contributions to the American role in Vietnam," Kalb said. "[McNamara] could have worked 50 years at the World Bank, and when he died, the lede would still say he was the man who failed in Vietnam."
Nevertheless, others regard McNamara's legacy more favorably. Jack P. Ruina, an MIT professor who worked under McNamara as Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, said he was a "great admirer of [McNamara's]" even though he was "a little bit like a machine." And Graham T. Allison, a former dean of the Kennedy School and now director of the Belfer Center, noted in an e-mailed statement that President Kennedy regarded McNamara as his "most valued counselor" during the potentially disastrous Cuban Missile Crisis.
Joseph S. Nye, another illustrious former Kennedy School dean who met McNamara in 1987 while working on an oral history project about the Cuban Missile Crisis, said that he had once thought of McNamara as "one-dimensional" and not to be admired. But later, through personal interactions, Nye said he found McNamara to be a man very interested in "moral questions" who genuinely cared about reducing poverty and nuclear risk.
"He didn't apologize [for his Vietnam mistakes], but he did certainly say a number of times in personal conversations and in public that he made mistakes, and he wanted others to avoid those mistakes," Nye said. On a post to his blog on the Huffington Post, Nye wrote that "the lives of leaders are more complicated than I thought when I was an assistant professor," and that while part of him will never forgive McNamara for the consequences of his mistakes in Vietnam, McNamara has also earned his respect by trying "to come to terms with his actions and to help a younger generation to learn."
McNamara's legendary quantitative approach to problem-solving was established long before he became the secretary of defense. After studying economics, mathematics, and philosophy at Berkeley, he earned his MBA at Harvard, where he explored systems analysis and the statistical techniques that he would later rely on in restructuring the Pentagon and managing the Vietnam War effort.
After finishing his education, he briefly worked in accounting before returning to HBS as an assistant professor. But he took leave to help direct the Allied air war in WWII, and then left academia afterwards to work at Ford Motor Company—where he later became President—because his Harvard salary was not enough to pay the medical bills when both he and his wife came down with cases of polio.
In an 1996 interview at Berkeley, McNamara said that he "wanted nothing more in the world than to go back to Harvard at the end of the war." But in 1966, McNamara was greeted at Harvard by hundreds of virulent anti-war student protesters when he came to deliver the first speech at the newly created Kennedy School Institute of Politics. When he refused to debate an anti-war spokesman brought on campus by Students for a Democratic Society, McNamara was blockaded in Quincy House and was forced to sneak out using decoys and underground steam tunnels.
Daniel Ellsberg '52, the government insider who leaked the top-secret Pentagon Papers to the New York Times in 1971 and exposed the knowledge that top officials had believed early on that the Vietnam War could not be won, had mixed feelings about McNamara's career.
"I think his overall role is considerably misunderstood," Ellsberg said. "Certainly he did have great influence on the bombing of North Vietnam, which was tragic and criminal...it's fair to say we were all participants in war crimes. I was a minor one, McNamara was a major one, as well as Johnson."
But he also said that he believed McNamara knew the war was futile early in his Pentagon career, and that McNamara worked diligently inside the government to limit bombings and prevent the conflict from escalating into nuclear war with China.
"Nobody was more important than McNamara, other than [President] Johnson, in getting us into Vietnam. But no official worked more effectively inside to limit and eventually try to end the war than McNamara," Ellsberg said. But McNamara could have even been more effective if his concerns were aired publicly, Ellsberg added, comparing McNamara's role in Vietnam to that of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in the recent Iraq War.
"We could have avoided that war if [Powell] had spoken frankly about his own doubts," Ellsberg said. "But McNamara took 30 years, so maybe in 30 years we'll hear Powell."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick '78 approved a 25 percent increase in the state's sales tax last week, from 5 percent to 6.25 percent, drawing apathy from some local business managers but also concerns from others who fear the move will only aggravate a slumping economy.
Of the projected increase in sales tax revenue, $275 million will be used to bolster the state's transportation network and stave off planned toll increases on the Massachusetts Turnpike. While another $160 million will be allocated to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the agency recently announced that it will also recommend a package of subway fare hikes to be implemented in the next few months that would raise $69 million a year. The combined tax increases are expected to raise over $1 billion in revenue for the state each year.
Despite the increases, which come as part of the state's $27 billion budget and will be effective Aug. 1, Massachusetts' sales tax is still relatively low compared to that in other states. Massachusetts first implemented a sales tax of 3 percent in 1966 and raised it to 5 percent in 1976, where it has remained since. Various essential goods, including clothing that costs less than $175 and unprepared food products, are exempt from sales tax. 
The approved budget will also raise the state's meal tax from 5 to 6.25 percent, and will allow local communities to raise the tax to 7 percent and keep the extra revenue. A 5 percent gross receipts tax will also be exacted on satellite TV providers' receipts from subscriptions, and local hotel taxes will increase by 2 percent. Sales tax will now also apply to alcohol purchased from retail stores, which had previously been exempt.
Denise A. Jillson, director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that it was still too early to say how much of an impact the sales tax hike would have on the Square. But she said that she hasn't heard any complaints from local businesses, adding that Harvard Square generally has very few problems retaining businesses.
"A few new restaurants are opening. Things are going well," Jillson said. "However, it would be much better if the overall economic weather was better." 
Reactions to the tax increases from shop managers and owners in the Square interviewed by The Crimson ranged from indifference to dismay. Some shop owners, such as Harvard Book Store Manager Mark C. Lamphier, said that they were unconcerned about the effect of the impending hike on their business, since the increase will be distributed uniformly across the state. Others, such as Cardullo's Gourmet Shop owner Francesca Cardullo, said that the increase was a nuisance for customers but that a 1.25 percent tax hike would have a negligible impact on sales. 
Stephen Zedros, manager of Brattle Street Florists, said that he has noticed slower foot traffic and sales over the course of the year, and that the tax increase would not help the situation. Cassie Freer, a manager at ice cream shop J.P Licks, said that she was not aware of the tax increase but thought that it would be "terrible," especially since she feels that customers already see their prices as high.
Patrick's signing of the budget followed approval by both houses of the Massachusetts legislature, which had disagreed with Patrick over the appropriate response to the state's fiscal crisis. Patrick had originally proposed taxing candy, soda, and gasoline, but eventually went along with the legislature's plan for a sales tax increase after lawmakers agreed to overhaul the state's ethics, pensions, and transportation laws. 
Cambridge City Councillor Sam Seidel said that he hopes that the tax increases will not have too much of a negative impact on Cambridge, even though consumers are spending less in the current economy. He noted that Harvard Square seems to be "immune" to the effects that tax hikes would typically have on small businesses.
"For the kinds of retail in Cambridge, the impact won't be very substantial," Seidel said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College's Office of Residential Life and Office of Student Life and Activities will be combined into a single office this upcoming academic year, Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds announced Thursday—a move she said would "streamline support for our undergraduates" but also cut costs and downsize the offices by five full-time staffers.The newly-established Office of Student Life, which will be headed by former Associate Dean of Residential Life Suzy M. Nelson, will oversee matters relating to residential life, housing, student activities, The Student Organization Center at Hilles, The Cambridge Queen's Head Pub, The Harvard College Women's Center, public service initiatives, and The Harvard Foundation, according to an announcement e-mailed by Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Robert P. Mitchell.The restructuring comes after three high-level College deans announced their departures this past year: Dean of Student Life Judith H. Kidd, Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere, and Dean for Administration and Finance Georgene B. Herschbach. In her announcement, Hammonds said that the office merger was the "most effective way to leverage the expertise of our College staff members” and would help "eliminate redundancy" as well.Mitchell said on Friday that he could not discuss personnel issues, including the specific roles of the five departing staffers or the total number of positions in either office, due to privacy concerns. A total of 13 staff members are currently listed on ORL and OSLA's Web sites, however, suggesting that the consolidation will eliminate a substantial percentage of positions devoted to student activities and residential life.Hammonds wrote in an e-mailed statement Friday that the office shuffling was prompted neither by budgetary pressures nor a need to trim excess services and staff, but rather represented the culmination of a review process of the College's organization that she initiated last spring when appointed Dean. She said the departure of the three deans accelerated that process."The departures of these important staff allowed me to think holistically about how the student activities and residential life units were organized. I came to the conclusion that there was a lot to be gained by merging these two offices," Hammonds wrote. "The merger also has the added benefit of reducing inefficiencies in running two separate offices, and saving some funds—but saving funds was not the driver of the decision." Mitchell declined to say how much money is being saved through the restructuring.Many of the deans and staffers in ORL and OSLA were out of the office or on vacation Friday and could not be reached for comment about the restructuring. Hammonds said that "the responsibilities, programming, and services" provided by the previously separate offices should not change in any way because of the merger."I have worked with student organizations and activities on other campuses, and believe that students' out-of-class experiences engender creativity, fellowship, and 'learning by doing,'" wrote Nelson in an e-mailed statement on Friday. Hammonds, who emphasized that Nelson had extensive experience with both residential life and student activities, noted that Nelson had previously worked at Cornell and Syracuse Universities.The exodus of deans has raised questions in recent months about how the College intends to preserve the years of administrative experience accumulated by the three departing officials. Herschbach, an almost 30-year veteran of Harvard as well as a specialist in budgetary matters, served as a House Master, FAS Registrar, and administrator for the College while expanding its undergraduate academic offerings. Rinere helped revamp the College's advising system as its first associate dean of advising programs, creating the Peer Advising Fellows program, the Advising Fortnight, the sophomore advising program, and the online advising portal. And Kidd oversaw the opening of the Pub and the Harvard College Women's Center during her six years as associate dean.Kidd and Herschbach both took buyouts in the University's voluntary early retirement incentive program, and Rinere is leaving for Columbia, where she will become dean of advising and associate dean of student affairs. Hammonds said that a search has begun for Herschbach's replacement, though Herschbach has agreed to work with the College through the fall term.Hammonds also announced Thursday that Joshua McIntosh, assistant deal of ORL, has been named associate dean for student life, and Assistant Dean and Director of Student Activities David Friedrich and Director of the Women's Center Susan Marine have both been appointed assistant deans for student life. Due to Rinere's departure, Assistant Dean Inge-Lise Ameer will serve as Interim Director of the Advising Program Office, Hammonds said, noting that the advising office remains part of the Office of Undergraduate Education.—Staff writer Peter F.
