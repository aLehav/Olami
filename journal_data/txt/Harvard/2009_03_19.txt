After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six months after calorie cards disappeared from the dining halls, they have made a comeback—in a less controversial form.  Instead of cards being placed directly next to the food, nutrition printouts will be located in separate spaces within each dining hall. We appreciate the efforts of Harvard University Dining Services to provide nutritional information for those who wish to access it while balancing concerns about the association between calorie counting and eating disorders.
Providing easily accessible information about dining hall food certainly helps students navigate their dining options. The old calorie cards, however, were a flawed method of encouraging healthful eating habits because the number of calories contained in a food item is not the only measure of its healthfulness. In fact, focusing only on calorie counts can lead to very unhealthful eating behavior, and many students pointed out that publicly displaying such information could be harmful for students already struggling with eating disorders. HUDS made the right decision to support those students by removing the cards from beside each dish.
Now, students can choose whether they want to examine the nutrition cards, which provide more comprehensive information about the food items offered in the dining halls—a complete nutritional breakdown, ingredients, and serving size suggestions. The cards also contain interesting facts about some of the dishes, such as country of origin, as part of a general culture of food education. HUDS has clearly put a great deal of thought and time into a more holistic approach toward promoting healthful eating. 
In general, it has been gratifying to see HUDS being more open and transparent about its dining decisions and more receptive to student feedback. The new website design is a great improvement, with easier access to menu information and a link to HUDS executive director Ted Mayer’s blog on dining at Harvard. The blog provides detailed information on HUDS programs like the Food Literacy Project and the activities of the HUDS Student-Faculty Advisory Committee. It also posts answers to student questions about Harvard dining and indicates changes that have been made in response to student requests. We hope that HUDS will continue this trend of improvement and increased attention to student input.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been less than two months since President Obama was inaugurated, but the sheen of the new administration has already begun to fade. During the first week of his presidency, Obama gave a very pretty speech in which he “rejected as false the choice between safety and ideals” and signed an executive order to close the controversial prison at the United States naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama’s first post on the White House website also claimed that his administration would be “the most open and transparent in history.” But the promise of “change” has thus far proven to be hollow.
The Obama administration surprised many in February when it pressed ahead with a Bush policy that refuses to even litigate certain cases for fear of a security breach. Much of the information concerned has been revealed through international government investigations. Nevertheless, judges are prevented from reviewing case information and evaluating the security breach themselves. Such an act directly opposes promises of transparency and holds many worrisome implications.
Recent events concerning a British prisoner at Guantanamo have exemplified this disappointedly consistent level of secrecy. Binyam Mohamed, a Pakistani-born British citizen, was the first prisoner to be released from Guantanamo after Obama ordered its closure earlier this year. Controversy has since abounded from Mohamed’s court case, in which a High Court decree to release information regarding torture allegations was denied by the British Foreign Office. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband’s justification for the refusal was that disclosure would do “serious and lasting harm”, to the United Kingdom’s intelligence exchange with the CIA.
An excessive degree of secrecy casts a suspicious light on any government and lends support to accusations of dubious motives. Indeed, the British High Court, which reviewed the material in question, asserted that it was “difficult to conceive that a democratically elected government could possibly have any rational objection to placing into the public domain such a summary of what its own officials reported as to how a detainee was treated by them” and stressed that the report involved “no disclosure of sensitive intelligence matters.” 
The High Court analysis presents the actions of both the American and British governments as highly suspect. If indeed the prohibited information concerns no security release, then Obama is irrefutably wrong in denying its exposure. Evidence of torture will be damaging to America’s reputation around the world, but it nevertheless deserves to be heard. Should such evidence later be revealed by a non-governmental source, it would even further discredit American ideals.  
The evidence to support Mohamed’s torture allegations is fairly damning, and it goes without saying that any civilized country should strictly adhere to Obama’s rhetoric and reject such barbaric treatment. Mohamed claims that the CIA would chain him in restrictive positions and that he was once shackled for eight days in a position where it was impossible to either stand straight or sit. He also allegedly spent five months in total darkness and one month straight when he was forced to continually listen to one repeated Eminem CD played at an ear-splitting volume.
Torture is both inhumane and ineffective; indeed, Guantanamo Bay has induced more suicides than convictions. A moral government would reject both physical acts of torture and circumstances that perpetuate the implication that torture is permissible. Thus, in the name of the ideology that both Obama and America represent, Obama should make a clean break from the past administration and refuse to cover up any acts of torture.
In addition to the innate moral inconsistencies that constitute acts of censorship, U.S. treatment of Binyam Mohamed has seriously undermined its relationship with Britain. The British government first requested the release of Mohamed in 2007 but was denied, and the US military later declared that it would formally charge Mohamed.  These charges have since all been dropped, but the CIA continues to maintain its stubborn policy of non-communication regarding the case. American threats to withhold future information or comparably pressurizing statements are completely inappropriate and violate the respect deserved by America’s closest ally. The stereotyped depiction of a bullying United States is strongly associated with the Bush era; Obama should not allow this label to taint his administration.
Barack Obama’s promises and ideals allowed him to win an election against all the odds. The characteristics that made Obama’s campaign so popular should be sustained throughout governance, and it is imperative that Obama revoke the excessively secret policies of Bush’s administration. Binyam Mohamed’s case highlights the shortcomings that prevent Obama’s administration from being “the most transparent in history” and thus warrant immediate attention. To hide evidence of torture is as morally dubious as the act itself; the last thing this country needs is another Bush.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For generations, they have been vilified. Their lunches have been taken from them. Women have rejected them. In horror movies, they are the first or second to pass on. And, at Harvard, they are quickly going extinct.
Of course, I mean nerds. Stereotyped as convention-going, pocket-protector-wearing, chess-playing, infrequently-showering types, nerds are one of our society’s most ridiculed groups. And, for a university with an international reputation as a bastion of intellectualism, Harvard is startlingly devoid of them. 
Indeed, Harvard has pulled off the astonishing feat of branding itself as the world’s greatest university but not the world’s nerdiest. While MIT and the University of Chicago duke it out for the title of nerdiest school, James Franco and Renee Zellweger show up at Harvard to party. Somehow, miracle of miracles, Harvard is “cool.” According to David Aberegg’s recent book, “Nerds: Who They Are, And Why We Need More of Them,” this is a bad thing. But is it? In society at large, nerds are law-abiding, caring, fundamentally good folk who keep the wheels of civilization grinding. But do we need them at Harvard? Should we start nerd affirmative action programs to ensure that candidates with prefrontal cortexes the size of New Jersey are not being disserved by Harvard’s insistence on extracurricular achievement?
The lack of “nerds” does indicate a preference on Harvard’s part. Each year, Harvard receives around 27,000 applications. And, when so many of them have 4.0 GPAs and stellar SAT scores, Harvard has to decide what other criteria it wants to emphasize. Harvard’s lecture halls will always be awash with academic superstars. But what about its stages and playing fields and after-school programs? Harvard presents students with a bewildering array of options. It seeks people who will take advantage of them and, in so doing, come to define themselves in terms other than their academic attainments. 
Indeed, you realize how few nerds Harvard has when you actually run into one of them. Most students, for all their arcane knowledge and intellectual curiosity, shy away from the label as well as the behaviors associated with it. Everyone mocks “that kid” in section when his only crime is speaking up repeatedly and at length to demonstrate his enthusiasm for the material. In high school, many of us were “that kid.” But here at Harvard, where everyone is presumed intelligent until proven otherwise, we can choose to be someone else.
Some criticize Harvard for this seemingly “anti-intellectual” climate. In 1990, Harvard graduate student Leonid Fridman founded the Society of Nerds and Geeks, citing a need to correct “prevalent and harmful” anti-intellectual attitudes. He editorialized: “We are not clamoring for a single-minded pursuit of academic excellence. We are simply urging a shift of values…There is no necessary connection between striving for knowledge and being a social misfit. In many cultures where intellect is valued more highly than it is here, academic achievement and social success go hand in hand.” SONG garnered national attention and then, within a few years, petered out. Perhaps the “anti-intellectual climate” was at fault. Or perhaps Harvard students simply realized that there were more effective ways of proving that nerds could attain social success than holding summits about it. Indeed, on his public profile, Fridman now appends to his title of Co-Founder of Society of Nerds and Geeks the backpedaling “yes, ‘tis sad but true.”
Perhaps Fridman realized that there is something to be said for Harvard’s anti-intellectualism. The wide array of opportunities that drives students to define themselves by characteristics other than their intellectual motiavation also creates a meta-social structure. It heightens the aspects of our personalities that we were unaware of before arriving at a school that encouraged us to classify ourselves by something other than our intellects. Here, there are literary nerds, drama nerds, math nerds, volunteerism nerds. Those at Harvard who still maintain their “pure” nerdiness are nerds among nerds, meta-nerds even. The trouble with these nerds is not, to quote Fridman, “their inarticulated preference to read books rather than to get wasted at parties.” It is their inarticulated preference to read books rather than talk to people or join extracurricular organizations without “science” in their names. And, although there is much to be said for the nerd as a species, there is even more to be said for the kind of well-rounded individuals Harvard strives to produce.
This is not to suggest that Harvard seize and forcibly reclaim ex-nerds. Far from it. Harvard is nerd rehab. You have to check yourself in. Those who seek a school filled with self-proclaimed “nerds” seek elsewhere. Dropping the H bomb may brand you as an intellectual or a Kennedy. But it will not give you much nerd cred. And that’s a good thing.

RE: “It’s Better Together,” “Call off the Gender Police” editorials, March 15
To the editors:
Having attended both single-sex and coeducational schools before coming to Harvard, I found myself disappointed by both the staff editorial and dissenting opinion on this topic.
First I was upset that both pieces began with attacks against their opponents rather than addressing any arguments.  Supporters of single-sex education are not “cootie-phobic,” and supporters of coeducation are not “the gender police.”  Education is such an important issue, and Harvard students, the people who unfortunately might very well be making the decisions about it in the future, revert to juvenile name-calling tactics.
The author of the staff editorial needs to learn that not everything misaligned with his or her political ideology is malicious.  Single-sex education is not about segregation or sexism.  Single-sex education is not about replacing the gender-integrated system; it’s about providing an alternative that some students find more fitting.
Furthermore, neither of these articles deals with how students of single-sex education feel about it.  If the students love it, why take it away?  If the students hate it why have it?  Experience is more important than ideology.
Finally, the claim that single-sex schools don’t prepare students for the world beyond school is actually a criticism of itself for failing to realize that single-sex students are involved in the world beyond their school.  Do the critics really believe single-sex students do nothing other than attend single-sex schools?  It’s narrow-minded to say that single-sex students will not have sufficient interaction with the opposite sex and will somehow lack cooperative or social qualities.  It also assumes individuals don’t develop after finishing single-sex schooling.
I wouldn’t trade my single-sex education if given the chance, and the majority of people I’ve met who’ve attended single-sex schools would agree with me.  Maybe The Crimson should conduct a poll.

RE: “Rockefeller Republicans, Harvard Republicans should be less self-conscious” Brian Bolduc, Column, March 16
To the editors:
Given the results of the 2008 elections, Brian Bolduc’s piece shows us quite plainly why some conservatives need to adjust the mirror and face the facts. Republicans are in a ditch, and we have one of two choices: keep digging or find an escape. Being less “self-conscious” and relying on the same good old Rush Limbaugh tactics and his radio advice is akin to sitting on the porch waiting for the domestic car industry to resurrect itself. Don’t hold your breath; it isn’t happening. The Harvard Republican Club has been aware of shifts in public mood for quite some time, eagerly reaching out and reshaping our tactics without yielding on core principles and beliefs. We are not apologizing or being “self-conscious” about our views; we are being better communicators of our ideas. It’s simple: Take one recent case for example where the Obama administration has decided to redefine unemployment benefits to include even part-time workers.
Instead of highlighting Republican opposition to doling out benefits to unemployed workers because that’s the “unabashed Republican way,” Republican governors emphasized why doing so will disrupt benefits for full-time workers, derail financial solvency for state unemployment funds, and raise business unemployment taxes. We are not apologizing for our beliefs; we are communicating them better. Here at Harvard, plastering the big “R” and employing Rush Limbaugh tactics will help no conservative cause. Just look at how Right to Life last year switched campaign tactics and emphasized family support, pregnancy services, and childcare resource initiatives instead. Results were apparent with the passage of new Undergraduate Council legislation last month dealing with these issues, and, before that, partnerships were formed with unlikely allies, including Students for Choice and the Radcliffe Union for Students. 
Before we criticize, we should look at the ends. This is politics; if different means transform the end (and, in the real world, this means winning or losing elections), it’s worth it to alter our tactics.

RE: “Cell-ebration” editorial, March 10
To the Editors:
It is no surprise that The Crimson would welcome President Obama’s executive order increasing federal funding for stem cell research. After all, Harvard will receive a huge portion of this funding.
     The college-industrial complex periodically promotes some “highly promising” research, which will illicit massive funding. In the ‘70s , investigators said they were within “striking distance” of understanding cancer cells, in 1984 AIDS specialists predicted a vaccine within three years, and in 2000 the genome project was going to revolutionize medicine. While few stem cell promoters would promise, as did former Senator John Edwards, that persons in wheelchairs would be walking, researchers do encourage the expectation that cures for everything from diabetes to Alzheimer’s are in the offing.
     A front page photograph in The Boston Globe, March 10, shows members of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute eating, among other things, chocolate eggs, as they celebrate the president’s decision. Decades from now, after billions are spent, stem cell researchers will still be touting cures that lie just over the horizon.

RE: “Civil Rights Heroes Commemorated” news article, Feb. 23
To the editors:
I am writing to thank and commend The Harvard Crimson for its coverage of the historic stamp issuance ceremony we held to honor Harvard Law School graduate and civil rights legend Charles Hamilton Houston, Jr., here in Cambridge, Saturday, February 21, 2009. While the Crimson’s article accurately conveyed the content and spirit of the event, it overlooked the exceptionally important work of my friend and colleague, Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who served on the United States Postal Service Committee responsible for selecting individuals to be honored by the issuance of stamps. He played a key role in seeing that Charles Hamilton Houston was among the civil rights pioneers honored. He worked doggedly on this for years, and the fruit of his labors could not have come at a more fitting time for this nation generally and its African American community particularly. 
To honor 12 civil-rights pioneers the same year marking the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth, the 100th anniversary of the founding the NAACP, the 80th anniversary of the reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the inauguration of President, and Harvard Law School graduate, Barack Obama is a worthy tribute. We ought to commend Professor Gates for his extraordinary efforts to honor these giants in this way, and I hope this letter brings him some measure of the thanks he rightly deserves.

Gerry Adams—president of Sinn Féin, the second-largest political party in Northern Ireland—eschewed the recent violence in his home country in a speech at a packed Institute of Politics last night. “The pathway forward is a strong one toward peace and reconciliation,” Adams said. “The story of Ireland was one of death and distress.”Adams last spoke at Harvard in 1994, when Northern Ireland and Sinn Féin—which has been historically associated with the Irish Republican Army—were in much different straits. That year, a series of ceasefires were called to put an end to a decades-long period of ethno-political conflict in Northern Ireland. Prior to the ceasefires, multi-party negotiations had commenced without Sinn Féin, but the party was admitted to the table later on the condition of an end to the violence.Adams said that Sinn Féin was “first and foremost an Irish republican party,” dedicated to “citizen’s rights, equality, freedom from British rule, and harmonious working relationships.” “We’re in a better place than we were 15 years ago,” Adams said. In reaction to a recent spate of violence in Northern Ireland, Adams advocated a “political alternative to war, a peaceful way to move forward.” “It was interesting to hear his side of what happened in this conflict, since there has been much press around the world,” said Christina A. Bain, a Kennedy School program administrator. “It is interesting to look at Ireland as a genesis of ethnic conflict.”Adams also spoke of his relationship with the United States—specifically with Bill and Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and Vice-President Biden. He described how the youngest generation in Ireland has never visited a prison, something that would have been far from the norm for young people even a generation ago. “They have and deserve a wonderful future, and this wouldn’t have happened without the involvement of people in the USA,” he said.Adams concluded by asking the crowd not to give up hope for a united and peaceful Ireland. “If we think we can be part of this, we can be part of this. If we think we can do nothing, we will do nothing,” he said. “Everything that happens starts with a dream. The trick is to make the dream come true. I think we can make the dream come true for the people who live in Ireland.”

Kathleen E. Hale ’09 won the Louis Begley Prize for Fiction for her short story about a young girl who channels her fear about her mother’s cancer diagnosis into an obsession with “bloodthirsty” and “scary” animals. The $1000 prize—which was established in 2000 in honor of former Harvard Advocate editor and contributor Louis Begley ’54—is awarded by the Advocate’s Board of Trustees each year to the best undergraduate fiction piece published in the Advocate, the College’s quarterly literary magazine.Over two dozen students and faculty members crowded into the Advocate’s sanctum for the award’s ceremony where both Begley, the author of “About Schmidt,” and English professor Louis Menand, the judge of the Begley prize, praised the merits of Hale’s short story.   “This is an absolutely brilliant piece of writing, and we’ll be hearing a lot from her in the future,” said Begley of Hale’s promise as a writer. “This is a story that is good enough to be in The New Yorker, Harper’s, The Atlantic.”Menand introduced Hale’s story with a speech on the elements of a great story, drawing upon examples from writers like John Updike, James Joyce, and O. Henry, He told the audience that he chose her piece because it embodied the abstract quality that Joyce called the “whatness of a thing” which is the ability to give the reader “a pang, a shiver, a dip.”   “When I was reading Kathleen’s story, it really jumped out at me. I thought to myself, ‘Now that’s a story,’” said Menand. “The story has a great voice. She created a great character—this kid with a very moving voice.” Hale, who has been published in the Advocate before, said that she was completely surprised when she heard that she had won the prize because she never expects people to like her writing since “it’s all about animals and kids.” She said she wrote from the perspective of a child partly because it was the way she understood her character and partly because she believes her voice as a writer has never matured beyond that of a fourteen year-old.     Begley believes that the prize is an important addition to what Menand calls the “great” undergraduate English program for fledgling writers. According to Begley, the Advocate gives young writers a chance to be nurtured and inspired by other aspiring authors, as well as the “heady rush” of being published for the first time. “I love the Advocate,” said Begley. “And the prize is another excuse for me to keep coming back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to a decline in the value of its endowment, the Institute of Politics submitted proposals for either a five or ten percent reduction in the size of its budget for fiscal year 2010, which will begin on July 1.The Institute’s endowment and budget are both contained within the Harvard Kennedy School. The proposals were drafted after the Kennedy School requested each of its divisions to submit three budgeting options, including one normal budget with no raises for faculty or staff members and contingency plans for five and ten percent reductions. “We don’t know currently how long or how deep the economic crisis will run,” said Melodie L. Jackson, associate dean for communications and public affairs at the Kennedy School. “At this stage, the contingency plans are designed to try to plan ahead for worst case scenarios.”The Institute draws its entire operating budget from its endowment, according to IOP Communications Director Esten Perez. The IOP endowment began with $10 million in donations after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy ’40 in 1963.While the IOP does not release information about the current value of its endowment, Kevin P. Kiley ’07, a former chair of the IOP Fellows Committee, and Ashwin Kaja ’07, a former director of the IOP Skills Program, wrote in a December 2005 Crimson editorial that the endowment was nearly $100 million. IOP Director Bill P. Purcell said that he expected the endowment’s decline to match that of Harvard’s overall endowment. In December, President Drew G. Faust warned that this drop-off could reach 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year. Purcell said he was confident in the ability of the IOP to continue providing services to its students.“We feel very comfortable that we’ll be able to fund our internship and stipend programs for this summer,” Purcell said. “Similarly, we’ve continued to operate the forum and we continue to keep the Fellows Program rich.”Jackson said that a budget for the entire Kennedy School was currently being evaluated by the university. “They will come back to us with additional guidance and that either codifies the budget, or we will go back and forth until we arrive at an approved budget,” she said. Jackson added that the process, which normally ends in April or May,  could take longer this year due to the economic climate. For now, the IOP is waiting to see which financial plan it will carry out. “Truthfully, we will not know the outcome until the end of the fiscal year,” Purcell said. —Staff writer Evan T.

Harvard administrators have readjusted budget planning assumptions for the next two years to keep spending in line with expectations for a slow economic recovery.The payout from the endowment will decline by 8 percent in dollar value for the next fiscal year and is projected to fall by at least another 8 percent from 2010 to 2011—meaning that the payout in two years will have shrunk by over 15 percent from this year, the University’s Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore said yesterday.The new budget guidance marks a departure from University instructions issued in the fall, which directed Harvard administrators to plan for scenarios ranging from a flat payout to a 2 percent decline in dollar value.Harvard officials were forced to reevaluate planning assumptions due to continued market volatility and economic uncertainty, Shore said. Since December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has plummeted by over 1000 points, dipping to 10-year lows this month.The University’s decision to issue more conservative budget guidance reflects progressively more pessimistic expectations for the pace of an economic rebound.“Ultimately, we’re going to have to adapt to a new economic reality,” Shore said. “The question is, how do you start to get back to a more sustainable place?”Since the endowment fell 22 percent in four months last year from its peak value of $36.9 billion, University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly stated that the University estimates a 30 percent decline in endowment value by June 30.The Corporation—Harvard’s highest governing body—adjusts the payout rate each year according to endowment returns, ensuring that the amount of money available for budgeting does not experience wild fluctuations from year to year. The University generally targets a 5 to 5.5 percent endowment payout rate, but the payout rate has not exceeded that level since 2004, due to above-average endowment growth in a booming economy. In the current financial climate, maintaining even flat spending from the endowment would require taking out an unusually large chunk of the endowment, calculated to be over 6 percent, the highest rate in over 20 years.Due to economic uncertainty, the Corporation had elected not to determine an endowment payout rate last fall, leaving administrators at the various schools to draft budget proposals under several endowment payout scenarios.Preliminary budgets were due this month, and Harvard deans were notified today of the 8 percent payout decline, Shore said.Because the schools had already budgeted for multiple scenarios, Shore said that the announcement would only require a “re-examination of ideas that already have been raised.”University officials plan to submit final budget proposals to the Corporation for fiscal year 2010 at the end of May.—Staff writer Athena Y.

Student entrepreneurs were awarded a total of $80,000 in prize money to help them develop and execute their business projects at yesterday’s I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge.The night’s largest catches came in the form of three $15,000 McKinley Family Grants, which went to a Web-heavy slate that included online enterprises geared towards providing free SAT prep to low-income students, making holiday travel cheaper, and navigating New York City more easily.  The I3 event was intended to spur greater student interest in entrepreneurship projects, which tend to go underrepresented on campus, according to Elizabeth L. Altmaier ’09, vice president of the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum and lead organizer of the event. “Everybody loves finance, consulting, non-profits and academia, but we offer another option to students, and that option is entrepreneurship and industry,” said Altmaier.  Yesterday’s winners included Robert W. Corty ’10 and Zachary V. Smith ‘09, who hope to create a one stop destination for college students to plan holiday trips with their project, GetOutOfCambridge. The pair snagged one of the three $15,000 McKinley Family Grants awarded last night, which, Corty said, would be put to use hiring programmers to redesign the group’s sight. Smith said he hoped that their Web site, originally conceived as a project for the popular undergraduate course Computer Science 50, will help students make savvier travel decisions. Currently, he said, students tend to make their travel plans “too late, at too high a cost, and with too little information.”The two other big winners last night were INeedAPencil.com, the free SAT prep service, and PortaGuide, an iPhone application with Global Positioning System capacities that functions as a tour guide around the Big Apple.Each of the teams represented at last night’s I3 awards ceremony had at least one undergraduate member—a stipulation of the Challenge, which was presented by the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum, Harvard Student Agencies, and the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard.For at least one of the students who came away empty-handed last night, hope was not lost.David J. Tischfield ’09, one of the members of the La Prusia Micro-enterprise Project—an enterprise aiming to set up a ceramics factory in a Nicaragua slum—was one of his first forays into entrepreneurship on campus. Though he was awarded no money through I3, he said he still planned to pursue the project through outside grants during his gap year before beginning an MD-PhD program.“I think there’s a lot of benefit to be reaped from these types of initiatives,” said Tischfield.

Sprinkled between a series of comedic anecdotes and profanities, Grammy Award winning comedian Lewis Black conveyed a clear message to a group of students at Kirkland House last night: find something you love, and do whatever it takes to pursue it.Notorious for his loud, angry stage persona, Black, visiting as part of the “Conversations with Kirkland” speaking series, turned down the volume—but not the crowd-pleasing four-letter words—and focused his talk on the pursuit of a fulfilling career. “Your major obligation in life, unless you’re a religious fanatic, is to figure out what you want to do and do it,” Black said.Black said that he believed that by pursuing many interests, students can find the key to their happiness.“And you’re at Harvard. It’s like a grocery store full of options,” Black exclaimed. “Harvard is Whole Foods.”But Black, speaking in the midst of trying economic times, also issued a caveat.“The last thing you should worry about is income, especially in this economy,” the comedian said.“Pursuing money isn’t sane,” he later warned. Speaking after the event, Black expressed disdain for the number of students entering business fields for the sake of financial gain.Yesterday’s appearance began with a short address, after which Black conducted a long question and answer period, discussing comedy and his career.Pointing to his experience teaching theater, Black remarked several times that, had he not become an entertainer, he would have liked to become an educator.The noted humorist said that the thing he loves most about comedy is “that I can say whatever I want.”“I’m lucky in the sense that I love what I do,” Black said.When asked about future plans, Black remarked that he is interested in writing books and plays, but also expressed interest in becoming the next president of Harvard.“I’d just run amok, never show up at anything,” he said, of his potential move to Mass. Hall.Black graduated from the Yale Graduate School of Drama in 1977, and has since worked on many projects, including numerous stand-up shows and a sketch on “The Daily Show” with John Stewart entitled “Back in Black.” Black’s comedy style is defined by angry tirades at social and political issues.Students were receptive to yesterday’s talk, and many found his advice about comedy helpful.“His descriptions of how silence can build tension in comedy was a very interesting aspect of the talk,” said William M. K. Stallings ’10.The “Conversations with Kirkland” Series was founded in 2002 by Peter V. Emerson, resident scholar of Kirkland house and former Kennedy School of Government student, and co-housemasters Tom C. Conley and Verena A. Conley. Since its inception, the series has hosted casual talks between students and a wide range of guest speakers, including several actors and famous politicians.

In response to recent incidents of racism on campus, about 200 undergraduates flocked to the Science Center lawn at noon yesterday to participate in the “Many Colors, One Harvard” rally. The demonstration—which was sponsored by more than 40 Harvard student groups—was held partially as a show of solidarity following an incident on March 6 in which racist comments were scrawled on the walls of Lowell Grille after a graffiti-themed party that was hosted by the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Student Association. As speakers blared music in the background, the multiracial crowd held up signs and banners with slogans such as “Silence is Unacceptable,” and “I skipped a midterm for this rally!” The students—clad in crimson shirts to demonstrate solidarity—enthusiastically chanted, “How do we stand? United!” The rally also included three brief speeches by Weijie Huang ’09, chair of the Phillips Brooks House Association Chinatown Committee; Andrea R. Flores ’10, president of the Undergraduate Council; and Edward Y. Lee ’08-09, co-director of the Harvard Undergraduates for Human Rights in North Korea.Shortly after the discriminatory graffiti was first discovered, seven different Asian-American student organizations sent e-mails last Saturday night to gauge interest in holding a rally. In less than a day, they had heard back from nearly 30 different student groups. “It was sort of the incident that brought a lot of other incidents to the forefront,” CSA co-president Daniel C. Suo ’09 said in reference to the recent patterns of racism. “People kept pouring in stories.” Flores said she was impressed by the inclusive response from Harvard’s Asian-American community.“The community affected did not become more insular,” Flores said. “Even though this didn’t affect the black community or the Latino community, they recognized that this was all of our struggle.”Flores also said that she realized the need for further action in order to maintain their “momentum.”The groups involved in the rally are in the process of discussing a number of future events, such as tolerance workshops and performances that deal with discrimination, according to Lee. “This was not a one-time event,” Lee said. “It is the beginning of a longer conversation.”Suo said that he believes most student groups will rally behind a common cause.“It just shows that each of these communities really understands the message we’re trying to propagate here,” he said.—Staff writer Evan T.

Christopher Soghoian—a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School—has developed a browser extension that prevents advertising networks from tracking Internet usage habits. The Google plug-in, entitled Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt-Out (TACO), allows users to opt out of 27 advertising networks.  The program prevents advertising companies from using Internet users’ past history to place user-specific advertisements. The extension had been downloaded by over 1000 people as of Monday night, according to Soghoian. Soghoian said he aims to raise awareness of Internet privacy issues with his program. “I’m not silly enough to expect this to be downloaded by grandmothers or non-technical people. I just want to draw attention to the issue,” said Soghoian. According to Soghoian, Congressman Rick Boucher of Virginia is currently lobbying for ad-tracking to become an opt-in program, meaning that Internet users would have to consent to having their activity monitored by advertising companies. At present, internet privacy restrictions resemble those for telemarketers, for which the Federal Communications Commission has allowed people to opt out of receiving solicitation calls. “If these programs are as good as these ad companies claim, they should have no program convincing people to opt-in to the programs,” said Soghoian. “They have the capability and the money. They should prove the programs merits instead of forcing it upon us.”Soghoian said the program is not yet perfect—with over 40 behavioral advertising companies on the internet, TACO has yet to block all ad tracking.“Hopefully, that will all be done within the next year,” he said.Soghoian noted that he has already talked to Microsoft and Mozilla about incorporating TACO into the popular web browsers Internet Explorer and Firefox. Mark A. Fusunyan ’12 said that since he doesn’t tend to click on online ads, ad-tracking did not pose a “huge concern” to him. “The program seems like a good idea to put into an existing browser,” said Matthew C. Mulroy ’12. —Staff writer Michael J. Ding can be reached at ding2@fas.harvard.edu.

The Committee on Ethnic Studies is considering an elongation of its name in an effort to recognize the diversity of its focus areas and to broaden its curricular scope in the future.Presented yesterday before the Faculty Council—the 18-member governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—the proposed name change to “The Committee on the Study of Ethnicity, Migration, Indigeneity, and Human Rights” would address the numerous academic dimensions that may not be fully represented under the current title.“This new name will better reflect the intellectual work that’s being done in these areas—very exciting work, I might add,” said committee member Deborah D. Foster about the four focus areas featured in the proposed moniker.Unlike the outdated name currently used, the new title would take an interdisciplinary and global approach that more accurately reflects the fluxes in population, increased globalization, and cultural changes undergone by certain ethnic groups, according to committee member Michele Lamont, professor of sociology, European studies, and African and African American studies.The comprehensiveness of the new name would allow the committee to develop a “more integrated and broader” curriculum that could better accommodate students’ intellectual needs under a larger umbrella, Lamont said.Foster—a senior lecturer on folklore and mythology—added that faculty can likely use the name makeover as an opportunity to develop new courses.The proposal—presented at yesterday’s meeting by FAS humanities dean Diana Sorensen and African and African American studies and English professor Werner Sollors—will undergo further discussion with members of the committee on ethnic studies before returning to the Faculty Council for review.—Staff writer Esther I.

It was meant to be a heat that didn’t count for anything. Nearing the end of a senior season that saw his pool-time cut drastically by a chronic injury, swimmer Dan Jones hit the water for a non-scoring run of his signature event, the 100 butterfly. The event drew little interest from the crowd.Jones’ finish was a different story. Fans and teammates exploded in jubilation when the Crimson swimmer’s time was displayed on the board, showing that he had recorded the fastest effort of the day—a mark that bested the January “Iron Man” meet’s eventual first place finisher by a tenth of a second.But there was a time when first place showings weren’t so unexpected. Taking the pool for nearly two decades alongside his twin brother Bill, Dan enjoyed more than his share of success prior to this winter.   Raised in a family that included four male swimmers, Bill and Dan showed a drive to dominate the pool from the moment they hit the water.“We always had a good family dynamic for swimming,” Bill recalls. “Dan and I were the more competitive of the four and were always swimming together...especially in high school when we were the only two on our team at our level. If it wasn’t for Dan, I wouldn’t be able to do what I can do, and I think vice-versa.”Growing up as stars in a small-time program in Fremont, Mich., the Jones twins had little structure to guide their workouts and instead relied on each other to help maintain their intensity.“[Our] competition is kind of a silent rivalry,” Dan says. “You don’t see it right away, but we’re always there pushing each other, and definitely supporting each other.”The two gained so much notoriety for their fierce battles that friends in high school and college have been known to place bets on their favorite brother.“I can’t tell you how many times we’ve been within a tenth of a second,” Dan laughs. “We’ve even tied for 16th before and had to swim off.”As the Jones’ talent grew in their late teens, the twins abandoned their second sport—cross-country—and focused on the prospect of recruitment. Despite their childhood fixation with local aquatic powerhouse Michigan, the allure of Cambridge changed the brothers’ thinking.“I feel like swimming is a good balance with academics here,” Bill explains. “I don’t know if I’d find quite the same balance at any other school. When I’m on [the residential] side of the river, I’ve got schoolwork or whatever, but when I go on [the athletic] side I can just release stress and let it all out in the pool.”“It’s been great,” Dan adds. “The team is really close and there are always guys to hang out with who support you..we definitely, definitely made the right decision.”The Crimson family provided a welcome home for the Jones brothers, but Dan and Bill faced the immediate challenge of fitting into a highly-structured program after largely self-coaching through high school.“It was a very big transition for us [to Division I swimming],” says Bill, citing weight training, two-a-day practices, and the large team format as college revelations. “Those three things, along with interactions with the coach really worked well, and we both dropped significant times.”As much as the Jones brothers gained from Harvard swimming, they also gave back to the program, bringing infectious dedication and intensity to the pool.“There’s an inherent competitiveness [between Dan and Bill],” head swimming coach Tim Murphy says. “When they went against each other, they always raised the bar for everyone else. It added to our competitiveness across the board.”The Jones brothers made an impact on the scoreboard from the outset. Bill garnered All-Ivy honors in the 200 medley as a freshman, and each twin notched multiple All-Ivy selections in his second season. The two have etched their names in the Crimson record books with dominance of their signature events—the 100 and 200 butterfly. Bill’s times of 47.29 and 1:45.12 stand as the top marks in school history, while Dan owns the sixth best effort in both races.With strong improvements early in their careers, the brothers appeared destined to bring a one-two punch to the pool for the Crimson. But an unforeseeable chronic injury began to create distance in their athletic results. With Bill notching nationals-caliber times, Dan found himself relegated to decreasingly strenuous workouts.“I essentially couldn’t train hard the entire [senior] season,” Dan says. “In February, I was able to get in the water more, but I was still only training five hours a week compared to 20 hours a week.”The disparities caused some of the famed Jones competition to evaporate. Bill qualified for the NCAA championships his junior year in both fly events, earning Mid-Major All-America Team honors from CollegeSwimming.com, while Dan failed to qualify for nationals. Bill—the 16-time All-Ivy selection—competed even more furiously this past season, guaranteeing a second trip to nationals over spring break this year.Still, while much of the attention has shifted to the more heralded twin, Dan has refused to give in to his setbacks. At this year’s Ivy championships, Dan went on to cut his time by three seconds from where it had been a month before, posting a 47.47 to take fourth in the 100 fly, as well as fifth in the 200 fly—both admirable feats for a “part-time” competitor.“[Dan] hung in there, fought through discouraging times and found a way,” Murphy praises. “It shows the kind of athlete and kind of person he is that he still had the ability to perform at a high level.”While the injured twin proves at a loss for words to describe his season-ending accomplishments, Bill knows his brother well enough to explain the inspiring effort.“I think it was just the sheer will of wanting to swim fast,” Bill says. “It was his senior year and just determination through all the hard work he put in the last 18 years.”Neither twin plans to continue swimming competitively following graduation, and the Winthrop roommates and fellow Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrators will have to face the reality of separation for the first time in their lives. Dan will prepare for medical school, while Bill enters graduate school in oceanography. But the distance won’t diminish the twins’ appreciation for their fraternal bond.“There is no way either of us would have gotten this far, both getting into Harvard and doing as well as we have swimming, without each other,” Dan says.—Staff writer Max N.

FlyBy shook off its hangover to be on sight here at Annenberg for Housing Day.  Check in periodically over the next few hours for updates on the revelry, rivalries, and ridiculousness of the scene at the 'Berg.

10:30: At the current moment, the energy here can only be described as tepid, at best.  FlyBy wants to give first shotouts to Dunster, Mather, and Eliot for currently having the biggest representation.  Other houses here include Pfoho and Currier. FlyBy gives a hearty boo to all you houses who are MIA: Leverett, Kirkland, Quincy, Adams, Cabot, Lowell, and Winthrop. WHERE YOU AT???  At any rate, hopefully we'll find some humor today, though I doubt we'll top probably the finest of housing day moments:

10:40:  We have an early front-runner for best poster (and also for best t-shirt).  The timely political reference, the integration of the elephant, and a slogan that perfectly personifies the house...Eliot is definitely in the lead right now:
10:45:  Another house that's earned kudos from FlyBy is Dunster (were we wrong?...naaahhh).  According to Dunsterites, they showed up at 3:30am, bounced the mighty Mather from their prime real estate...and commenced to construct a FORT?
But...Dunster couldn't just let well alone.  They had a good thing going, but decided to throw this shitty sign up on it.  Well done, Dumpster...
10:50: Pfoho just upped the ante a bit.
11:00: If you are not in Pfoho, Mather, or Dunster, you should be ashamed of yourself.  As of 11 a.m., these are the only three houses with a presence.  Freshmen will be flooding Annenberg in short order, and why the other houses have yet to work themselves into a frenzy (much less even be here), FlyBy does not know.  Mather is the only house keeping the fledgling spirit alive right now, rockin to some fresh tunes including Weezy's "Mrs. Officer" and their own original hit, which FlyBy couldn't help but nod its head to.  We expect to hear this one at a few parties tonight.
11:15: The delegates from Leverett are here.  And...oh wait...no...that doesn't say what I think it does...
Oh Lord no....you knew someone was going to do it.  But...wwwhhhyyyy??????
11:30: It took until 11:30, but we finally have a bit of skin to spice up the scene.  Courtesy of Currier, of course:
11:35: Mather just threw this over the speakers.  FlyBy: hype.

11:45: Currently, FlyBy cannot find the Kirkland and Winthrop contingents.  They may be just inside...but that's weak sauce.  Dunster is here though, as this moose below has been using his megaphone for evil rather than good, relentlessly heckling every passerby with gems like, "It's OK, it's raining, no one can see you crying," and "Your umbrella can't hide that ugly shirt."
12:00: Time to go through a few posters...
FlyBy has already decided to give four thumbs down to anything that exploits Obama poorly.
This girl in Quincy at least lived up to her poster...
We guess this one gets its point across, no?
And Leverett just decided to go with what works. SEX SELLS.
While we would clown on Leverett, especially for having to call out Mather, they might be on to something...
12:15: There we go...
12:20: According to Matherites, they came in yesterday to store this banner in the upper floors of Mem Hall.  Great though...but subpar execution, Mather.  And Leverett....well, true to form (However, as FlyBy was writing this, Leverett stormed from their subordinate location and took out Mather's banner...we're pleased, good show).
12:30: As of a few minutes ago, FlyBy had still not seen any Winthropians.  Typical. We guess this isn't IMs, so why would they be here?  Update: Apparently this email went over Winthrop's list around 11:
"Hey team,
Not only are we sorely underrepresented at annenberg, but to make matters worse some Pfoho stole the head of our lion's costume. This has gone too far- we really need your support in reclaiming Winthrop's rightful place at the top. If you've ever played in an intramural game for the house, or even if you smile at Sonya everyday in the dining
hall-we need your help! Come to Annenberg sometime between 11 and 2 to show that Winthrop REFUSES to be the new Dunster!"
Ummmmm, it might be too late 'Throp.  FlyBy did finally find a few of you guys, though.
12:45: Bad trend alert.  The dark blue/purple that serves as the base color for a large number of house shirts (Leverett, Eliot, Kirkland, Lowell, Cabot, if memory serves us correct) is not a good look.  Shouldn't you want to stand out in a crowd?  Cabot House, however, gets a few points for this reasonably clever shirt (FlyBy doesn't ask for much):
1:00: As we begin to wind down here, FlyBy would be remiss if it didn't mention a couple of its favorites.  Quincy has been fairly low-key, outside of the distinctive color of their shirts.  In this scene, they were in the process of getting outclassed by the Lowellians standing next to them.  Fear not, though, you'll be getting a taste of that Master's Residence later today.
Adams's claim to fame was a five minute rush of the upper steps of Memorial Hall, where they flew the banner and doubled the noise level inside Annenberg for a bit.  FlyBy, however, wasn't all too surprised that the guy holding Adams's flag was dressed in a full suit.
1:20: So what did we learn today?  It would seem like a few of the crappy houses really worked to ensure its newest residents didn't burst into tears by dousing them with house spirit, while the awesome houses kept it tranquil and let the others have their moment in the sun.  And Winthrop...well, it continues to be Winthrop.  FlyBy has to sign off, though, there are more important things to attend to.

Today--as freshman year culminates in a joyful orgy of House pride--began as a night of revelry, as it always must, with the River Run. The Class of 2012, however, successfully brought this age-old vigil to a new level: Chaos.
What is Chaos, you might ask?
Chaos is the sheer amount of nail polish remover, Axe body spray, and high-proof liquor that soaked the multi-tiered cardboard boats flung into the Charles last night.
Chaos is the scene described by an emergency caller around 11:20p.m., who believed that the Weld boathouse had caught fire, bringing dozens of firemen as well as Harvard, Cambridge, and Massachusetts State Police to the scene.
Chaos is the (supposedly) burning riverbank, to which freshmen eagerly thronged, only to be verbally chastised and scurried away by troopers’ threats of arrest.
Chaos is, apparently, the modus operandi of the Class of 2012.
Now, I’m only in my second year here, but I’ve never heard of anything like this. Neither has the Cambridge Fire Department, I might add: one member of the force said she had no idea what "River Run" was and had no memory of the phenomenon in her entire time with the force.
In response to the mayhem that was last night, I must both congratulate--the full force of the 2012 definitely impresses–and urge this year’s freshmen to ‘simma’ down now y’all.’
By all means, the craziness is encouraged--I streaked from Kirkland to Straus in an attempt to appease the River gods--but know that even if you go bat-shit and start flipping cars over, you could still end up in Cabot just like me.

FlyBy would like to take this moment to congratulate all our thesis writers out there for a job well done.  We won't even attempt to try to wax poetically about the nature of your experience--and your final triumph--on this page.  All we can say is that we're abundantly proud of you for persevering, and, for everyone else out there: if you see a thesis writer out tonight, give them a pat on the back, and hand them a drink...they've earned it.
So, take just a moment to reminisce.  And when you're done with that moment GET HYPE for tonight/tomorrow/SB/April etc., etc., etc.!
