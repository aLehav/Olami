After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eighty-five undergraduates were awarded the Hoopes Prize for outstanding senior theses or research projects on Friday.
The award—which is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes ’19—comes with a prize of $4,000 for student recipients and $1,000 for their advisers.
After being nominated by their advisers, Hoopes Prize winners submitted their projects to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which then reviewed the applications. Award winners were notified via email on Friday morning.
“I was totally flabbergasted,” said Hoopes Prize winner Keru Cai ’11, who is an English concentrator. “I didn’t think I would win at all. I had all but forgotten about the entire process.”
Cai—who wrote her thesis on aesthetic experience and free will in the novels “War and Peace” and “Middlemarch”—said she plans to use her award money to travel in Asia this summer.
Computer Science concentrator David J. Wu ’11 said he awoke to a “fun” surprise on Friday morning upon discovering that his thesis on improving computer performance in the abstract strategy game Arimaa had been awarded the Hoopes Prize.
Prizewinner Fernando Racimo ’11 said he felt honored by the award but added that his greatest satisfaction derived from the work he put into his thesis on the genetic basis of social behavior in microbial evolution.
“The award was really something extra,” said Racimo, who is an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator.
Prizewinner Oliver D. Strand ’11, whose Literature thesis on conceptions of the function of art was inspired by an email conversation with a friend, echoed Racimo’s sentiment.
“I feel really grateful,” he said, “but I got even more out of the process.”
Social Studies concentrator Sarah E. Esty ’11, who received the Hoopes Prize for her thesis on party politics and abortion in the ’60s and ’70s, said she felt fortunate to have been chosen for the award out of a pool of talented students.
“I know how these prizes are sometimes very arbitrary and don’t recognize people who have worked very hard on their theses, so I felt very lucky to receive it,” she said.
Esty said she plans to spend her award money to help fund a summer roadtrip across the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seniors have been chosen to present speeches at the annual Class Day, the Senior Class Committee announced on Thursday.
Timothy J. Lambert ’11 and Laura Jaramillo ’10-11 will give the Harvard Orations, which are meant to be thoughtful and reflective pieces. Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 and Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11 will share the light-hearted Ivy Orations.
Class Day, scheduled for May 25, is an annual ceremony in which the seniors gather one last time before Commencement. As part of the tradition, the event features four speeches—two Harvard Orations and two Ivy Orations—from members of the senior class. One male and one female speaker are chosen for each of the two categories.
Just after spring break, the Senior Class Committee emailed the senior class about the Class Day Orations competition. Seniors had about a month to submit their speeches.
Michael J. Pankratz ’11, the chair of Class Day Committee, said there were about 70 submissions in total. The committee, which is composed of 12 seniors, read through all of the speeches before choosing between four and five finalists for each category and gender.
Levin-Gesundheit said he submitted a speech to take on the “tremendous challenge to stand up in front of thousands of people and not crawl away and cry.”
As the former president of the improvisational comedy group Immediate Gratification Players, Levin-Gesundheit said he practiced his speech in front of its members and relied on them as “comedy therapists.”
While Levin-Gesundheit took the time to practice, and even memorize, his speech, Jaramillo said she did not even find out she was a finalist until the night before the audition when she received a reminder email from the Senior Class Committee.
Jaramillo had never opened the initial email about her status as a finalist because it came with the subject line “Male Oration Finalist”—she had accidentally checked a box saying she is a male.
“I had no idea I had been picked,” she said. “I freaked out and didn’t have time to practice, but managed to pull it together in the last minute.”
Pankrtaz said the speakers were chosen based on several criteria. For the Harvard Oration, the committee chose speeches that are creative and would “appeal to a lot of people.” For the Ivy Oration, the committee looked for “someone who makes us laugh,” Pankratz said.
“I think we succeeded,” Pankratz said about the committee’s decision. “All four speeches are different from each other and connect well with the students.”
Levin-Gesundheit said he hopes to make more than 10,000 people burst out in laughter as he presents his speech in front of his friends and family. Levin-Gesundheit’s speech, titled “We Are Not Special,” reminds students to “stop looking at the mirror,” he said.
“There are enough people in the world telling us that we are special, so it’s important to remind us that we are not,” said Levin-Gesundheit, who is also a member of a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Jaramillo said she will speak about her experience and share the lessons she learned at Harvard.
Lambert, who has never written a speech before, said his talk is about ambivalence, and relates to the mixed feelings many seniors have upon graduating.
Fitzpatrick, a former president of Harvard’s improvisational comedy group On Thin Ice, head writer for On Harvard Time, and a Crimson Arts writer, said her speech “touches on an area that is very important to me.”
In addition to the four senior speeches, this year’s celebration will include an address from comedian and actress Amy Poehler, a speech by Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds, an awards ceremony, and an evening concert by the Radcliffe Choral Society, the Harvard Glee Club, and the Harvard University Band.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the school year comes to a close, many Harvard athletic teams are competing in some of their most important events of the season.
The softball squad faces off against Cornell today and tomorrow in a best-of-three series, with the winner claiming the Ivy League Championship. The championship is a rematch of last year in which Cornell defeated the Crimson by one run in the third game. Despite the loss to the Big Red last season, Harvard has been improving, racking up a 34-10 season record and setting multiple program records this year. The two teams split their two-game matchup earlier this year. The Crimson seeks its fifth Ivy League Championship and its first since 2007.
The men’s lacrosse team is also looking to claim the Ivy League Championship tomorrow at noon against Cornell. After defeating Penn yesterday, 12-8, in the semifinals, the Crimson moved even closer to an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament. Harvard enters the matchup with three straight wins, but Cornell comes in with even more momentum from nine straight victories and a 12-2 record. The Big Red has walked away victorious in the last 13 games against the Crimson, but Harvard still has a fighting chance. Cornell has only won by one goal in each of the last three seasons.
The women’s lacrosse team is the final team seeking an Ivy League Championship title this weekend. Harvard edged Dartmouth in the semifinals yesterday, 11-10, and will now face Princeton tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m. Last season, the women emerged victorious over the Tigers with an 11-9 win.
With all of the championships taking place this weekend, the track and field teams are getting in on the action with an important race of their own. The men and women’s squads travel to New Haven, Conn., for the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships. Both the men and women’s squads finished seventh at Heps last year and will look to improve on those records.
Finally, the sailing team travels to Dartmouth this weekend to compete for the Fowle Trophy in the 62nd New England Team Race. Last year, the both the men and women’s squads placed seventh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sports world will turn its attention later this afternoon to the most exciting two minutes in sports: The Kentucky Derby. Held annually on the first Saturday in May, the event is perhaps the most iconic in all of horse racing.
No doubt two former Harvard students will be watching the results very closely: Andrew Beyer and Steven Crist ’78. After all, the two have been working in horse racing for the past 30 years and are giants in the industry.
Beyer, a former Crimson sports editor, came to Harvard with some experience in horse racing.   But when he discovered the horse racing tracks in the area, Beyer was hooked.
It was this love of horse racing that caused Beyer not to graduate.
"My final examination in Chaucer [in the Spring of 1966] was scheduled on the same day that Kauai King would be trying to win the Triple Crown at Belmont Park,” Beyer told The Harvard Crimson in 1975. “I knew nothing about the Canterbury Tales, but I did know something about Amberoid in the Belmont Stakes. So I went to the track."
It turned out Beyer knew what he was doing. Amberoid pulled off the upset.
Since then, Beyer has become, according to many, “the best—and most important—handicapper in America.”  After making the key discovery that horses’ times mattered much more than previously thought, he had a significant edge over the rest of the bettors. However, he later divulged his methods in a series of watershed books, which eventually led to the creation of a new statistic, the Beyer Speed Figure, which has become the cornerstone for much of betting in horse racing.
Currently, Beyer writes for both the Washington Post and the Daily Racing Form, a daily publication that covers horse racing and releases the horses’ past performances. Its publisher is also a former Harvard student, though unlike Beyer, Crist ’78 actually graduated.
While at Harvard, Crist went to the dog track at Wonderland and immediately fell in love with the sport.
“I felt right at home the first night,” he told the Harvard Magazine last year.   Pretty soon, he began to focus on horse racing and has been deeply involved ever since.
From 1981 to 1990, Crist was the horse racing columnist for the New York Times. After holding a number of other jobs in the industry, Crist became the CEO of the Daily Racing Form in 1998. Though he no longer serves in that capacity, Crist remains quite involved in the paper.
In the meantime, Crist has written a number of books, including “Exotic Betting” and “Betting on Myself: Adventures of a Horse Player and Publisher.”

Every year, the first Saturday in May is designated Free Comic Book Day. At least two locations in Harvard Square are participating in the event: Newbury Comics in The Garage and New England Comics on Eliot Street.
Marvel has put out a few comics for the event. There is a new issue of "The Amazing Spider-Man" as well as an issue in which Captain America and Thor team up—a complete and utterly shocking surprise given that movies based on both characters are hitting theaters soon. And speaking of "Thor," which saw release on May 6, you can also grab a comic book which recaps the hero's entire canon up to now.
DC also has a few special issues to give away. One features adaptations of "Young Justice" and "Batman: The Brave and The Bold," shows that air on Cartoon Network. The other is an issue of "The Green Lantern," which recounts Hal Jordan's origin story, presumably in an effort to broaden the property's fanbase before the film adaptation hits theaters later this summer.
For horror fans, Dark Horse Comics is giving away a double issue of "Baltimore" and "Criminal Macabre." Similarly gritty is Top Cow's tie-in to the video game version of popular series "The Darkness."
Nostalgics can also find a few properties they might enjoy. Archie Comics has put out an issue of Pep Comics starring Betty and Veronica, as well as an adaptation of Sonic the Hedgehog. There is also an issue of "Summer Fun" by John Stanley, printed with a retro aesthetic. Keeping with the theme of aged properties, Disney has published a double issue starring Darkwing Duck, and Chip 'N' Dale. There are also free issues of "Inspector Gadget," "The Simpsons" (with a section drawn by Sergio Aragones, of all people), and a reprinting of vintage "Mickey Mouse."
In case all of these sound too average, there are a few oddball inclusions. A comic book version of "Kung Fu Panda" and a modern update of "Richie Rich"—the most relatable comic book character in the world—seem almost too absurd to comprehend. Other off-kilter releases include a comic book about Adam West (yes, the actor), a story based on Jim Henson's "Dark Crystal," and a very meta comic book that is literally about how to collect other comic books.
But there's always one standout on Free Comic Book Day, and this year's winner is "Super Dinosaur." Words can hardly do it justice, but the cover features a T-Rex with four arms, a shoulder-mounted missile launcher, and a Gatling gun.
Finally, while these comics may be free, stores do have to buy them from the publisher. So if you do drop in to pick up a few freebies, think about buying something as well.
