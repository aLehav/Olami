After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time that the Harvard women’s volleyball team took the court for the 2013 season, its starting lineup included only one freshman: setter Corie Bain. But any fan that night would have been hard-pressed to identify her as a rookie.
Bain slated 10 kills, 31 assists, and nine digs in her debut, setting a high standard from the very beginning. The sophomore has not let up since then. She now holds both Harvard and Ivy League records with 16 triple-doubles and 34 double-doubles despite having played just two seasons.
But for Bain, this standout success has been nothing new.
Bain started playing volleyball at the age of nine, not an uncommon occurrence for someone from Manhattan Beach, Calif., a town that produces many high-level volleyball players. She proceeded to captain both the Surf City and Long Beach Rockstar Volleyball Club teams in her area, on top of captaining the Mira Costa High School team for two years.
As captain, she helped lead her high school to two straight conference championships and took home MVP honors in 2012.
“My club teams prepared me a lot more technically for volleyball,” Bain said. “But in terms of just playing the sport and loving it—high school provided that for me.”
It wasn’t before long that colleges began to notice Bain. She began playing in college showcase tournaments with her club team in her freshman year of high school, but waited until sophomore year to formally start the recruiting process.
Bain’s initial focus, however, was nowhere near Cambridge. Bain had her mind set on the University of California, Berkeley. But, to the disappointment of Bain, the Bears had their mind set on another setter recruit. With Cal no longer in her future, Bain had to shift her focus elsewhere.
Former club teammates at Princeton were the first to tip her off to the idea of Ivy League volleyball. Bain began to strongly consider the idea, even though it was unlike what many of her teammates were doing at the time. Rather than commit to a school in her sophomore year like a good number of her teammates had done, Bain waited patiently for the Ancient Eight—which recruits later than most Division I schools—to come calling. Specifically, she had three schools in mind: Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.
In her junior year, Bain first traveled across the country to Cambridge. After spending time with the team, she had found the atmosphere that she had been looking for.
“[The players’] interactions with each other looked like something I could definitely be a part of,” Bain said. “I felt really welcome.”
Bain has had no problem continuing her dominant ways at the collegiate level. She started each of the 47 games of her freshman and sophomore seasons, earning the Ivy League Rookie of the Week and Player of the Week awards five times apiece. In her rookie campaign, she broke the single-season school record with 50 service aces. This past year, she earned First Team All-Ivy honors.
But, ultimately, it is Bain’s dedication to the squad rather than to her own personal records that make her such a valuable player, according to teammates. Bain’s work ethic and talent have helped push the Crimson to its first Ivy League championship since 2004. In a tone-setting 3-2 win over Yale on Oct. 3, Bain put up her third triple-double of the season with 11 kills, 32 assists, and 12 digs, recording a season-high six service aces as well.
“She always prioritizes the team’s success over her own,” captain Kristen Casey said. “She deservedly receives a lot of individual accolades, but everyone that plays with her knows she would give all that up for the team to win. That is the kind of person you want next to you on and off the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four games in, the Harvard men’s basketball team (3-1) has performed roughly as its ranking would have suggested. Apart from a one-point loss to Holy Cross, Harvard has blown away each of its other opponents with suffocating defense and timely offense. The Crimson will look to run its record to 4-0 at home when UMass comes to town Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion (2:00 p.m., ESPN3). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard goes for its first marquee nonconference win of the season.
Saunders’ Theatre: Senior wing Wesley Saunders has been, in a word, sublime. He is averaging 20.5 points and 9.0 rebounds a game, leading the team in both categories. He is also first in both minutes played and assists/turnover ratio, getting to the line nearly seven times a game—and making 86 percent of those attempts. Albeit in a small sample size, he looks to be once again the best player in the conference
Saturday, he will be matched up with Minutemen wing Derrick Gordon. Gordon made national news last April when he became the first openly gay player in Division I men’s college basketball, news that overshadowed the significant step forward he took on the court in his sophomore season. His junior year, Gordon has become a dynamic weapon. He averages 13.8 points and 5.5 rebounds a game, slashing into the paint and drawing foul after foul.
Although the Lalanne-Steve Moundou-Missi matchup inside will be a big one for the Crimson, whether Saunders can win—or even dominate—this matchup will likely determine the game.
Home Sweet Home: Harvard’s win against Houston ran its home record to 14-1 since the end of the 2012 season, and the team has not lost at home so far this year. The record doesn’t come without an asterisk—as Harvard’s prestige has grown, fewer and fewer teams have been willing to come to Cambridge to play the Crimson. Before the season, coach Tommy Amaker talked about the difficulty of engaging high-major opponents in “home-and-home” contracts; as Harvard has improved, a game once seen as a gimme has become far less desirable for opponents.
In recent years, however, the Crimson has been able to draw regional foes into matchups at home. After beating Boston College five straight times on the road, the Eagles agreed to come to Harvard last January for the first time in 23 years. UMass will be similarly making its first trip to Cambridge in 33 years.
Consistency v. Change: The last two times these teams met, a 77-74 UMass win, the Minutemen looked radically different. Cady Lalanne, the team’s leading scorer this year, is the only starter from that game still on the team. Star guard Chaz Williams, who had 12 points and 10 assists, is now playing in Turkey; Raphiael Putney is in the D-League.
Harvard, however, has been a model of consistency. Four of the starters from two years ago—Saunders, Moundou-Missi, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, and senior forward Kenyatta Smith—will likely start again Saturday. Of the eight-man rotation that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker used two years ago, six still figure prominently into the Crimson rotation—the only exceptions being the graduated Laurent Rivard ’14 and Christian Webster ’13.
The Crimson’s big three—Chambers, Moundou-Missi, and Saunders—have barely missed a game in the last two-plus years. They are averaging a combined 98.0 minutes a game this season and, against UMass, will be emblematic of the Crimson’s internal consistency.
