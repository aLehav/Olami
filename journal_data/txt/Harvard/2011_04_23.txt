Love sites like Groupon, but wish the deals were located closer to campus? Now, thanks to Harvard Student Agencies' recent partnership with Edhance, students have access to deals in the Square and beyond.
 
"Edhance approached HSA about the partnership last semester," HSA President Ethan N. Waxman '12 wrote in an email. "We signed on because we feel it is a compelling discount program in line with our mission of providing useful services to Harvard students."
 
Edhance offers deals at Harvard Square businesses like Harvard Cleaners, The Harvard Shop, Raven Used Books, and more. Additionally, discounts can be found throughout Boston and at online stores such as Target, Barnes & Noble, and Sephora.
 
Rather than printing out coupons or carrying around a membership card, Edhance offers automatic cash back rewards to students when they register their debit and credit cards and use them at participating stores. 
 
They'll also get a shout-out on Edhance's live savings news feed, which keeps track of members card usage declaring, "...REBECCA saved $9.50 at Target.com, Thomas saved $0.21 at iTunes, and Lorraine saved $3.60 at Groupon..." Although the savings feed might seem a bit "Big Brother," with sign up completely free and as much as 20% cash back on purchases, as Waxman wrote, "It is sort of a no brainer."

This week was Harvard's "Housing Week," a week dedicated to raising awareness of the need for affordable housing. As a part of the week's activities, Harvard Habitat for Humanity built a shed for a family. Volunteers worked afternoons in front of the Science Center from Monday through Friday to construct the shed. Although many of the builders were members of Harvard's Habitat chapter, others were student volunteers from the College, and a sophomore from Georgetown showed up to help on Friday.
