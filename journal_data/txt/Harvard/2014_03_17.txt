After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A group of researchers led by Harvard associate astronomy professor John M. Kovac, announced on Monday in a panel discussion at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics that it has discovered the first direct evidence of cosmic inflation, a theory that may alter the way people understand the origins of the universe.
 
First proposed in 1980 by now-MIT professor Alan H. Guth, cosmic inflation theorizes that the universe expanded exponentially in fractions of a second after the Big Bang occurred almost 14 billion years ago. Guth has postulated that this “bang” was caused by a form of gravitational repulsion.
The collaboration, led by researchers from Harvard, Stanford, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Minnesota, worked with BICEP2, a telescope on the South Pole, which, according to the team, observed the universe’s cosmic microwave background—faint, residual light from the Big Bang. While observing the light, the team discovered a polarization pattern that strongly suggests the existence of cosmic inflation.
 
“This is opening a window, what we believe is a new regime of physics,” said Kovac, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which since 1955 has brought together the resources of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory.
 
After more than three years of analyzing data, the team also detected gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time. These waves have been predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, but until now have never been observed. 
According to a press release issued by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, “These waves have been described as the ‘first tremors of the Big Bang.’” The data also confirm a connection between quantum mechanics and general relativity, the team announced.
 
Kovac said Monday that the detection of gravitational waves, in addition to the evidence of cosmic inflation, has the potential to teach people about physics at its “extreme frontiers.” 
Yet according to Clement Pryke, a cosmologist at the University of Minnesota who worked on the collaboration, the team, as well as the scientific community, is “not completely done” with the research process.
 
“This is not just the end, this is the beginning,” he said, noting that the results of the BICEP2 research have not yet been published in a journal and must await confirmation by additional experiments.
 
Still, according to  Marc Kamionkowski, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the project but sat on Monday’s panel, the implications of the study will forever alter the way people think about the universe, 
“This is not something that’s a home run, it’s a grand slam,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 18, 2014, at 6:18 p.m.
Former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who worked closely with Harvard on its projects in Allston and the Longwood Medical Area, has been diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer that has spread to his liver and lymph nodes, according to a report Sunday in the Boston Globe. The longest-serving mayor of Boston, Menino, 71, led the city for 20 years until his term expired at the beginning of 2014.
The Globe reported that Menino received the diagnosis in early February and has since undergone one session of intravenous chemotherapy. He is scheduled to undergo three more rounds of treatment, and the doctors have yet to find the origin of the metastasized cancer.
University President Drew G. Faust, who has worked closely with Menino on Harvard’s interests in Allston and presented him with an honorary degree in May 2013, phoned the former mayor on Monday morning to offer her support. In a statement Monday afternoon, Faust said that Menino will have her support as he fights a new battle.
“Tom Menino is a true friend to me and to Harvard,” Faust said. “As he rises to meet this new challenge we will be keeping him and his family in our thoughts and prayers.”
In his two decades in office, Menino oversaw an up-and-down partnership between the city and the University. The relationship started off rocky when, in 1997—four years after Menino had first been elected—the University announced that it had secretly purchased more than 50 acres of land in Allston, working through a Boston real estate firm to avoid restrictions on large sales to a single buyer. In a letter to then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine, Menino called the move “the highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”
Lawrence H. Summers replaced Rudenstine in the Massachusetts Hall corner office in 2001 and is credited with having improved relations with the city. Under Summers, Harvard and Boston worked together to craft an ambitious vision for development in Allston.
 “I had the great pleasure of working with Mayor Menino to position Harvard with our neighbors in Boston to meet the challenges of the 21st century,” Summers wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday morning. “I know firsthand how tough Mayor Menino is, and I am sure that he will fight hard to tackle this challenge, just as he has always done.”
Though it was forced to significantly scale back its ambitions in Allston due to the the global financial crisis, the University has once again launched an ambitious plan for development in Allston, with the most notable tenant to be the growing School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.


In addition, Menino has worked with both Summers and Faust to launch Harvard-run after-school and virtual education programs that serve students in Boston neighborhoods.
After his announcement last year that he would not seek re-election, Menino was offered fellowships at the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the School of Public Health, but there was concern that the positions would represent conflicts of interest, given the recent approval of a multibillion dollar plan for Harvard redevelopment in Allston by a board of officials that Menino had appointed. Ultimately, Menino turned down both offers to take a position at Boston University.

UPDATED: March 18, 2014, at 6:09 p.m.
Clover Food Lab, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant chain located on Holyoke St., installed the first Bitcoin ATM in Harvard Square Monday morning.
The ATM is the second that Liberty Teller, the same company that introduced an ATM to South Station last month, has constructed.
“Our ultimate goal is to make Bitcoin accessible to people everywhere, and South Station was a huge start,” co-founder of Liberty Teller Chris Yim said. “But we had a lot of demand...for something in Cambridge.”
Yim, who showed the ATM to the Harvard Bitcoin Club last month before installing it in Clover, said that Ayr Muir, CEO and founder of Clover Food Labs and fellow MIT graduate, was excited about the prospect of a Bitcoin ATM at his restaurant.
"[Yim] asked if we would help him out with a little experiment to see if a high-traffic, fast-food restaurant like ours would be a good site for one of the first Bitcoin ATMs in the country," Muir said in a statement to Boston Business Journal. "We're giving it a go and we're excited to see what happens."
The Bitcoin ATM, which is smaller than a standard ATM and rests on a stand, allows customers to scan their Bitcoin wallet address—essentially their Bitcoin bank account—and convert their cash to Bitcoin. The ATM does not currently, however, allow customers to convert Bitcoin (BTC) to U.S. dollars.
The introduction of the ATM comes after several meetups of Harvard’s Bitcoin Club, an informal group started by an alleged Harvard Business School alumnus who calls himself "John Harvard Bitcoin." The group convenes periodically to discuss virtual currency, and "John Harvard Bitcoin" offers attendees free Bitcoins and Dogecoins.
Neither members of the club nor The Crimson have been able to confirm the self-described alumnus's identity.
At the last meeting, attendants said they received around .03 BTC from "John Harvard Bitcoin," a figure that represents approximately $20 according to the $623 price of a single Bitcoin at press time.
According to "John Harvard Bitcoin," the club will be holding a Bitcoin panel at HBS that will feature Yim on Mar. 24.
Yim said that although he is still working out how he will balance his company’s time between South Station and Harvard Square, he is excited to attend the panel and help provide for the demand he sees for Bitcoin in the Square.
“Whenever we are not at the machine or working on the locations...we will definitely try to go out to the [Harvard Bitcoin Club] meetups. It’s great to see all the interest,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a tale of two halves when the Harvard men’s lacrosse team took on Brown at Soldiers Field on Saturday night for both teams’ Ivy League opener.
Despite ending the first 30 minutes of play tied with the Bears (3-2, 0-1 Ivy), the Crimson (4-2, 1-0 Ivy) ultimately ended the match with a 16-10 win, outscoring the visitors eight to two in the final half of play.
“Brown played really well offensively in the first half,  [and] we had a couple breakouts, but it was mostly back and forth,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But after halftime we kept our composure and we just really kept our process and our game plan and didn’t change anything. We just came out fired up and made some big plays that changed the game [in the] third quarter.”
While the Crimson was tied with Brown three times in the first half, Harvard returned to the field in the third quarter of play and outscored Brown, 5-0, with five different Crimson players finding the back of the net.
The home team ended the night with a total of eight different goal scorers, not uncommon for this season’s new and improved Crimson attacking unit.
“We are very selfless offensively,” Wojcik said. “The players trust each other, and they share the ball and move the ball really well. Tonight we showed that we don’t rely on just one player, but it’s all about the six players on the field.”
Coming off of a 15-7 victory at Georgetown last Saturday in which nine different Crimson players got on the board, Harvard had three different players score hat tricks against the Bears: sophomore attackmen Devin Dwyer and Will Walker, and veteran midfielder Daniel Eipp.
“In the past couple weeks of practice, we have been playing as a cohesive unit,” Eipp said. “A lot of people got on the scoreboard, which is awesome. We have a really deep bench.”
While the game plan for Harvard changed very little after intermission, the Crimson defense, led by junior Jake Gambitsky in goal, stepped up its game in the second half and stonewalled the Brown offense. Harvard allowed just two goals for 16 attempts after the break.
“I am really proud of Jake because of how well he played in that second half. It’s really difficult to play the goalie position, and when you give up eight goals in the first half it is difficult to regroup,” Wojcik said. “It is a testament to his mental testament and character. He was able to wipe the slate clean and make a huge save that really was the turning point of the game in the third quarter.”
Gambitsky, who tallied a career high 18 saves last week against the Hoyas earning him Ivy League Player of the Week, recorded nine saves in the second half of play. His defensive unit’s improvement over the course of the match was notable as well.
“Defense really buckled down [in the second half],” Eipp said. “We tried to be really smart on offense in the second half and not take dumb shots…. We cut down on [Brown’s] fast break opportunities on offense, which really allowed the defense to see them coming and force them to take bad shots.”
The Crimson kept the Bear’s high point scorers almost silent. Brown’s Sam Hurster and Dylan Molloy had each registered 13 points, but only Hurster got the ball past Gambitsky twice in the first half to help Brown go into the break tied with the Crimson. A strong Harvard defense prevented either of the two players from finding the back of the net in the second half.
“I was very happy with our energy and our effort, and how hard we played all over the field to get the win,” Wojcik said. “Brown had some strong attacking plays in the first half, but in the second half we really kept our composure."
The competition marks Harvard’s first Ancient Eight matchup this season, and after a tough loss last year against the Bears, the Crimson was especially pleased with the night’s triumph.
“The Ivy League is so strong, and it is incredibly important to get a good seed going into the tournament,” Eipp said. “Last year we lost to Brown [11-9] after being up most of the game, so this is definitely a big win for us. After this win, I think we are all really excited for our Ivy games going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was little Midwestern kindness in store for the No. 6/6 Harvard women’s ice hockey team on Saturday.
In its 10th program visit to the NCAA Tournament, the Crimson ended its season at the hands of No. 3/3 Wisconsin, 2-1, at LeBahn Arena in Madison, Wis.
In front of the sold-out local crowd, Harvard (23-7-4, 16-3-3 ECAC) struggled to break through the Badgers’ (28-7-2, 21-5-2 WCHA) blueline. Wisconsin senior goaltender Alex Rigsby made 23 stops on the way to her 100th career victory and a trip to the Frozen Four in which she’ll hope to bookend her collegiate career with another national title. The Badgers will face No. 1 Minnesota on Friday in Hamden, Conn.
“I thought our team played very well,” said Harvard interim head coach Maura Crowell. “I think Wisconsin’s a very good team, and unfortunately we didn’t get much puck luck tonight, and they came up with the win.”
Against Rigsby’s saves and the Badgers’ defense, the Crimson registered just seven and nine shots, respectively, during the first and second periods to Wisconsin’s 18 and 17.
Bombarded with pucks, Harvard sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer made 42 saves throughout the contest, one of her highest marks all season. But she could not make all the stops.
“Getting a lot of shots—that’s always the best game to play in,” Maschmeyer said. “Our defensemen do a great job of clearing in front of the net so they make it a lot easier for me to control the puck.”
Badgers forwards Blayre Turnbull and Katy Josephs were both able to find openings past Maschmeyer, however. With less than four minutes left in the first frame, Turnbull and linemate Brittany Ammerman double-teamed the goalie in front of the crease, and Turnbull sent the puck into the net by the left pipe. A period later, with the clock ticking down the in the middle period, Josephs drove the puck under Maschmeyer to give her team the 2-0 lead.
“Hockey’s a game where literally anything can happen, so going in with a clear mind [is best],” Maschmeyer said. “For me, I just want to focus on one puck at a time.”
On the other end of the ice, it took over 55 minutes of hockey for the Crimson to break through Rigsby and her teammates. At one point in the third period, the goaltender made an acrobatic save from outside the left post using just her stick.
With 3:23 left in the contest, sophomore forward Dylanne Crugnale gave her team a fighting chance as she took an assist from classmate Miye D’Oench to finally evade Rigsby.
“[The puck] popped out and I put it in,” Crugnale said. “We got a lot of energy after that. We just wanted to tie it up…. Obviously it’s frustrating to not be able to score, but it was encourage to get one [goal].”
As time slipped away, gaining possessions became even more important as the Crimson searched for the game-tying goal. Wisconsin won three of the final four face-offs, taking an overall edge 35-19 in face-offs won throughout the game. With a half minute to go in the game, Harvard finally wrangled control of the puck. Crowell opted to pull Maschmeyer and activate 6-on-5 play. Despite the advantage, there was too little time and the buzzer could not be avoided.
“[With] 20 minutes left in our season potentially, you’ve got to empty the tank,” Crowell said. “[The team] believed, and they went after it. Wisconsin was a bit on their heels at that point and they just gave us more motivation to keep playing that way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As most of the Harvard track and field team stayed in the cold weather of Cambridge to prepare for the upcoming spring season, three of the team’s top athletes were given the chance to compete in the hot weather of Albuquerque, N.M. at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships this weekend.
Seniors Maksim Korolev and James Leakos and junior Erika Veidis represented the Crimson at the national event. Korolev competed in both the 3000 and 5000-meter races while Leakos competed in the 5000 and Veidis in the 800-meter. Although each struggled over the weekend, the chance to represent their school on a national level was a great experience and has added to the anticipation of the spring season, according to Harvard coach Jason Saretsky.
“Overall I was really pleased that we were able to have such great representation at the national championship,” Saretsky said. “I thought our student-athletes competed valiantly, and I was proud of their effort.”
To say that Korolev has been having a strong senior campaign would be an understatement. After finishing third overall in the cross country NCAA Championships with a time of 29:59.5 in the 10K race, Korolev has not slowed down coming into the indoor season.
The senior earned a spot in the 3K in Albuquerque at the Valentine Invitational on Feb. 8th with a time of 7:51.52, and he claimed a place in the 5K championship at the Terrier invitational on January 25th with a time of 13:42.56. The Missouri native currently holds the school and Ivy League records in both events.
“Both [races] have similar plans of getting out there and getting a good position…hopefully giving him a chance to use that big strong kick that he’s got,” Saretsky said.
But Korolev had a harder time this weekend. The senior finished 13th in the 5K with a time of 14:34.41 and 14th in the 3K with a time of 8:28.55. He was named a second team All-American in both events.
Leakos almost didn’t get to race at the championship meet. After earning a spot last minute due to a scratch, the 5K Ivy League champion would get to race again alongside his teammate, Korolev, with a seed time of 13:49.78.
“Those guys have raced tremendously hard for a long time,” Saretsky said. “It’s great to see their hard work pay off and to have the opportunity to compete at the national championships is great.”
Unfortunately, Leakos did not finish the 5K race.
“The guys both had tough races also but I think it makes us all hungrier for [the] outdoor [season],” Veidis said.
Veidis is no stranger to national competition either. This was the junior’s second consecutive year racing at the NCAA Championships in the 800-meter. Last year, Veidis finished 10th overall with a time of 2:06.69, just missing qualifying for the finals heat.
“Last year I was definitely terrified being there, and this year I felt a little more confident,” Veidis said. “I know last year I placed a lot of those girls on a pedestal, and this year I really had a sense like I belonged there. I think it definitely shows that I’ve grown a lot as an athlete.”
Veidis qualified this season for the 800-meter race with a seed time of 2:05.00 which she earned at the BU Terrier Invitational. She finished 15th overall with a time of 2:11.03, failing to make it to the final heat. The junior was also named a second team All-American.
“My race was pretty horrible luck. I came down with something over the last couple days,” Veidis said. “I’ve never felt worse in a race but I’m glad I made myself race anyway. I would have been pretty disappointed if I had scratched. I definitely am very hungry for outdoor now, because watching the 800-meter final yesterday, I knew that I could have definitely placed pretty highly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore goalie Kelly Weis had the best performance of her career in net at Soldiers Field on Saturday for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, and the offense made sure it didn’t go to waste. And then some.
After struggling on offense in last week’s lone contest against Penn, the Crimson (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) was firing on all cylinders in Cambridge this weekend against Marquette (3-4, 0-0 Big East). The offense exploded for 10 goals in the second half of its game against the Wisconsin-based school en route to handily defeating the Golden Eagles, 15-6.
“We definitely could have beat them by a lot more,” sophomore attacker Meghan Bauer said. “But we came out with a win and I think it was a good warm-up for playing [No. 3] Syracuse on Tuesday.”
Coming into the second half with a three-goal advantage, Harvard freshman Marisa Romeo was able to maneuver down the middle of the Marquette defense, finishing by beating the goalie over the left shoulder to extend the Crimson lead to four. Two more straight goals in the next four minutes from Harvard brought its lead to six. The deficit was simply too great for the Golden Eagles to fly out of.
Marquette’s difficulties on offense did not arise from a lack of opportunity. The Golden Eagles were able to fire 25 shots on the day and 19 on net. But Weis was consistently denying the Golden Eagles’ chances, stopping more than two-thirds of their shots on net in the winning effort. The six opponent goals is a season low for the Crimson.
“Kelly’s been playing really sick lately putting up a lot of saves,” Bauer said. “She plays really well every game. She’s really clutch.”
Marquette was able to hang around with Harvard for the majority of the first half, trailing 3-2 with nine minutes left in the first half. But two goals before the end of the first half gave the home team a comfortable advantage going into the next 30 minutes.
Marquette goalie sophomore Sarah Priem was able to stop 11 shots on the day, but it simply wasn’t enough to thwart the barrage of offense from the Crimson, which fired 38 shots, including 26 attempts on goal.
Harvard was propelled by the offense of Romeo. The first-year standout recorded two goals in each half on her way to leading to team in goals. The goal total matches a career-high for the rookie out of Syracuse that she set in the team’s last game, a loss against Ivy League rival Penn. The rookie leads the team with 17 goals on the season, eight ahead of the next leading scorer.
“Romeo’s definitely one of our very best attackers and she’s definitely stepping up as a freshman,” Bauer said. “She’s putting up more points than anyone else on the team…. She brings a lot to the table.”
Not to be overshadowed by Romeo was fellow freshman Megan Hennessey, who found the back of the net on three of her four shot attempts on the day. The first-year player also won six draw controls on the day.
Despite the lack of offensive output from Marquette, the Golden Eagles still had two players notch two goals on the day. Sophomore attackers Emily Donavan and Claire Costanza led the charge on offense, beating Weis twice. Freshman Amanda Bochniak also contributed on the attack, assisting on two goals and scoring an unassisted one.
The Crimson and Golden Eagles found themselves on equal footing with winning ground balls, splitting at 22 apiece, and the home team actually found itself behind in the turnover count, losing possession, 19-14. But Harvard came away with a significant edge on draws, winning 16 of 23 on the day and helping the team maintain a distinct advantage over the Golden Eagles. Hennessey led the Crimson with six draw wins on the day, followed by four from sophomore midfielder Aubrey Todd.
Harvard also took better advantage of its free-position opportunities on the day. The Crimson was able to beat Priem on seven of the team’s 12 attempts. Marquette only had five attempts on the day, only converting for one lone goal from sophomore Kenzie Brown.
The Crimson remains undefeated at home on the season with its win over the Big East opponent. Harvard has held a distinct advantage at Soldiers Field, scoring 25 goals at home compared to its opponents’ total of 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the very first game of the season, it was clear that Jonah Travis was ready to make an impact on the Harvard men’s basketball team’s run at an Ivy League championship and March Madness bid. The junior forward opened the 2013-2014 campaign with a double-double, notching 20 points and 10 rebounds in just 22 minutes off the bench in an 82-72 win over Holy Cross.
Averaging 13.2 minutes per game, Travis has been a key cog in the Crimson’s rotation this season. The third-year player has established a presence in the paint, averaging a rebound every four minutes with gritty determination—a characteristic that caused his secondary school coach, Dave Thorson of DeLaSalle High School in Minneapolis, Minn., to take notice early.
“The thing that stands out about Jonah is his work ethic [and] his intensity,” said Thorson, who first started coaching Travis at a camp in elementary school.  “And that’s something that’s always stood out, even as a young basketball player.”
The government concentrator has been as effective on the offensive glass as he has been on the defensive glass. This season, Travis has picked up 46 boards off opponents’ attempts and 46 boards off Harvard attempts. His presence as an offensive rebounder has helped the Crimson extend possessions and pick up crucial points.
“[Jonah’s game is] intense, but powerful,” Thorson said. “He’s a battler and always has been. He exhibited that with his effort and how he played all the time [in high school].”
Thorson attributed Travis’s past and recent success to the junior’s consistent drive to improve.
“He wanted to get better,” Thorson said. “He wanted to improve, and all of those things that go into that, being a great listener, being a great observer, being someone who puts the time into get better, that’s who he is.”
Despite often playing power forward or even center for the Crimson, Travis stands at only 6’6”. In order to be effective at the Division I level, he had to develop his game to be able to compete with taller, more athletic players.
“He needed to refine his offensive game,” Thorson said. “And I think he’s done that. As a sophomore in high school, people would back off of him on a face-up, 17-foot shot. But he’s worked so hard on his face-up game ad being able to make that shot now that you have to guard him.”
Travis’s junior year has not been without some difficulty. Halfway through the season, the 6’6” forward suffered a concussion that sidelined him for two games in late January and early February. The Minnesota native returned in a limited capacity on Feb. 7 in a win against Brown, recording only three minutes. Travis did not play double-digit minutes until Feb. 21 against Penn. But in the last four games of the season, he averaged 16 minutes in winning efforts.
The junior has also seen a reduced role in the Crimson’s starting rotation this year In order to work returning senior forward Kyle Casey back into the lineup. As a sophomore, Travis started 14 games on the year, but he has primarily come off of the bench this season. Despite his decreased time on the floor, his presence in the paint could make a difference when 12th-seeded Harvard faces fifth seed Cincinnati in Spokane, Wash., on Thursday in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
Travis’s tenaciousness as a player runs in the family. His little brother, Reid, followed in the footsteps of his older brother as a standout at DeLaSalle. Now a high school senior, Reid Travis received offers from Gonzaga, Stanford, and Duke, ultimately opting to play for the Cardinals in Palo Alto. The 6’8” power forward is ESPN’s 25th-ranked recruit for the class of 2014.
“[Reid] was impacted by little-brother syndrome,” Thorson said. “Reid, in his development, and his experience as a player, I think Jonah really impacted that. Reid saw what made Jonah successful, and I don’t think there’s any question he exhibits those same sort of characteristics.”
The hard work ethic does not stop once Travis leaves the basketball court. The junior spent his summer interning at the asset management firm Wellington Management located in Boston. He also traveled to India with the Crossover Basketball and Scholars Academy to tutor underprivileged children in academics and teach them basketball.
“He doesn’t take anything for granted whether he’s playing basketball or studying,” Thorson said. “That’s why he’s so successful basketball and why he’s such a marvelous young man.”

The Harvard women’s water polo team began its ten game California road trip this weekend in shaky fashion, dropping three out of four games to top ranked teams.
SAN JOSE STATE 20, HARVARD 1
This was the first time all season that the Crimson (9-9, 0-1 Ivy League) has been matched up against a top ten team in the nation. Facing off against the 10th-ranked Spartans (17-9, 0-2 Mountain West) in the pool, Harvard was unable to get anything going offensively.
“The teams that we played so far are a lot more physical than we’re used to, which is different for us, but it’s definitely good for us,” freshman attacker Lexi Del Toro said. “We’re learning how to play against these top teams, [and] we’re learning how to be more physical and to take that back with us.”
Harvard’s lone goal was scored by senior co-captain Shayna Price, with all the other scoring taken care of by the San Jose State offense. The second half of scoring belonged to the Spartans, who scored nine unanswered goals to end the game.
For the Crimson, key scorer Yoshi Andersen did not play the entire weekend, and her goal scoring ability was missed throughout the match ups.
“She [Yoshi] is a big part of our offensive team,” Del Toro said. “I think that we played well without her, but you could definitely tell she was missing on the offensive side at least because she is a big scorer.”
UC SAN DIEGO 15, HARVARD 7
Wrestling with yet another team in the top 20 proved to be too much for the Crimson as the squad could not hold off the No. 13 Tritons (17-9).
Harvard went down early in the game, trailing 6-1 by the end of the first quarter of play.
“I think it’s the same style [of play], but the team is full of really great players,” junior co-captain Ariel Dukes said. “They’re a really good physical team and it’s always good to play those kinds of teams.
The Crimson was able to battle back in the second quarter of the game by scoring two goals of its own, only to be matched by UC San Diego. From then on the Tritons had control of the game, almost doubling Harvard’s goal tally for the remainder of the match.
SAN DIEGO STATE 7, HARVARD 5
Facing off for the second time in as many weeks, the Aztecs (12-8, 1-0 Mountain West) once again came out ahead of the battle. This week the Crimson was able to keep the game closer than the previous match up, falling by two goals compared to last week’s 12-8 loss in the Harvard Invite.
“Our coach had a very thorough scouting report for San Diego State since we already played them,” Del Toro said. “We had a lot of film on them and what they were running, so we had a much more thorough approach than last time on what they were going to run and who their good players were, so we were definitely more prepared stat wise.”
San Diego State, ranked No. 19 in the country, was able to ward off the Crimson’s offense for the majority of the game, with Harvard unable to score more than two goals in each of the four quarters of play.
The game was a defensive battle for both teams, with six Crimson players tallying steals and Dukes recording her season-high save total with 13 stops in net.
Late in the fourth quarter, Harvard was able to tie the game at five to bring the team closer to victory. The Aztecs retaliated with two back to back goals, putting them ahead and ultimately sealing the win.
HARVARD 10, CAL LUTHERAN 3
In its first match up of the road trip, the Crimson offense set the team up for success early.
Harvard scored seven goals in the first half, going up, 7-2, against the Regals (3-16) by the break.
The Crimson’s offense was anchored by Del Toro, who had three goals, her personal best on the season. Junior Victoria Frager followed with two goals and four steals throughout the competition.
Freshman Zoe Osbourne led Harvard in steals with five in the game. Overall the Crimson tallied 18 steals, halting Cal Lutheran’s offensive momentum multiple times throughout the match up.
“This weekend went really well for us, considering we’ve been given the opportunity to play against some of the best teams in the country,” Del Toro said. “It’s definitely a learning experience for us. We didn’t win all our games, but we did learn something in each of our games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Never, in all that time, has there been preseason buzz quite like the anticipation surrounding this season's Crimson team. Never anything close.”
Those were the words of ESPN’s senior college basketball writer Andy Katz prior to this season. Coming off of an Ivy League title and the upset of third-seeded New Mexico, Harvard was graduating only one senior, and all-Ivy seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry would be returning from an academic cheating scandal to play their final year. Sophomore Siyani Chambers was the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year and expected to once again be the top point guard in the league, alongside the Ivy League’s returning leading scorer, junior wing Wesley Saunders.
The lineup was also going to feature the best shooter in the league, co-captain guard Laurent Rivard, and Harvard’s first top-100 recruit, newcomer Zena Edosomwan.
The hype was real. The lineup was so deep that many thought that Harvard’s intrasquad scrimmage at the beginning of the year could be the season’s most competitive Ivy League matchup.
With so many players on the Crimson roster to talk about, one name went nearly unmentioned over the entire summer: Evan Cummins.
In his first year, Cummins was an after-thought. As a freshman, the 6’9” forward out of Northfield Mount Hermon School averaged only 2.7 minutes, many of which came with the game already being decided. He played in only six games, scoring a total of three points on the season.
This isn’t uncommon for a freshman in the Ivy League, where playing time can be hard to come by. In fact, Harvard’s roster was actually depleted last year, so Cummins arguably got more time than he could have expected.
Coming into this season, however, the sophomore wasn’t expected to be a major contributor, or even really play. That all changed very quickly.
Early in the season, Cummins played mostly garbage minutes as the Crimson blew out teams and were able to empty the bench.
But in the Great Alaska Shootout Championship game on Nov. 30, Cummins got the chance to show why he deserved to be a part of the rotation. Though Harvard nursed a 23-point lead at the half over Texas Christian, the game crept nervously close in the second half. Cummins helped his team stave off a hungry TCU squad, coming off the bench with 11 points and 10 boards.
“He played well for us in Alaska,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “You could see the confidence growing.”
Just three days later, the Crimson was back in Boston to face a struggling Northeastern squad, in a game that should have been over before it started. But that wasn’t the case.
At half time, Harvard was befuddled, up only by five. After playing a couple of minutes in the first half, Cummins dominated the second half of play. Amaker turned to his sophomore forward, and he delivered. Cummins filled up the stat sheet with 10 points, six rebounds, and two blocks on 4-5 shooting, all in only 21 minutes.
“With [junior forward] Jonah [Travis] coming off the bench and now Evan coming off the bench, we’ve got a lot of bigs,” Casey said after the game. “We were in foul trouble tonight. What Evan can do for us brings another dimension to our team.”
The Wesborough, Mass., native continued to progress into his new role and recorded more than ten minutes in each of the next four games. In the six games in which Cummins played 10-plus minutes, he averaged 16.2 points per 40 minutes. That rate would be good enough to put Cummins among the top five scorers in the Ivy League, if he played the whole game.
At 6’ 9’’, Cummins is on the bigger side for an Ivy League forward, and he lets his opponents know it. The sophomore can toss his body around in the paint, securing rebounds and consistently contesting shots.
Cummins provides a presence in the lane that the Crimson desperately needs without the services of injured junior center Kenyatta Smith, and is a true luxury for Amaker when Casey or junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi needs a breather. Though he only averages 10.2 minutes per game, Cummins is often the first or second option off the bench for Amaker.
The sophomore’s style of play is a mix of the Miami Heat’s Chris Bosh and the Golden State Warrior’s David Lee. Like Bosh, Cummins has an arsenal of offensive weapons. He can post you up, shoot the mid-range, and even step out beyond the arc. Cummins’s presence down low is like Lee’s. Both fight hard for position and contest shots at a very high level for forwards.
Though Cummins is hardly Harvard’s first option on offense, he has a scoring ability that would make him a starter on practically any other Ivy League roster. With Harvard slated to play Cincinnati in the first round of the NCAA tournament on March 20, the teams have only three days to scout, prepare, and make the long journey to Spokane, Wash.
Don’t be surprised if Cummins comes off the bench and surprises the Bearcats, just like he did to his Ivy League opponents this season.

 It looks like we’ve reached the point in the semester that Harvard likes to call “midterm period”—that nebulous, not-really-midterm span of weeks beginning right after add-drop period and leading up to, essentially, the day before reading period. 
In spirit of this happy time of year, and in spirit of the goal of this column, last week I decided to take a study break to TD Garden to catch up with my pals Sting and Paul Simon. As much as Brain Break fills a void on those lonely Sunday nights, no amount of peanut butter and dry cereal can compare to the joy of watching a Real Housewife rock out to "Roxanne" so hard that she spills her $15 Cosmo all over herself.
 In Review: Paul Simon and Sting, On Stage Together
What struck me the most about this concert was how well Paul Simon and Sting’s voices have held up all these years. Also, Paul Simon is, like, REALLY short. There was a point when he walked by the rhythm section and was almost entirely obscured by an African-looking drum (which resembled the Fertility Vase of the Ndebele tribe)
 
In all seriousness though, it was an amazing night full of my favorite classics from both of the performers’ repertoires. I belted along to “Message in a Bottle”, “You Can Call Me Al”, and my personal favorite, “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”. Simon and Sting’s duets brought me to my feet, and dancing along was fun after I got past the awkwardness of all the tipsy-middle-aged bopping going on around me. But hey, white haired dude with the soul patch hip thrusting in the staircase, you do you.
 This Week: Los Lonely Boys – March 19th @ 8:00 pm, Paradise Rock Club. $33
If you didn’t make it off campus, or if going home for spring break is more like a 20 minute car ride for you, then definitely hit up the Paradise Rock Club this Wednesday. Paradise Rock Club is one of my favorite venues in Boston – it’s intimate standing room with the benefit of top-billed bands. Los Lonely Boys have always been close to my heart – the bilingual, Santana-influenced band of brothers always transport me to sunny skies and warm weather with their feel-good music (if only in my mind). Though they topped the charts with their 2003 hit “Heaven,” my all-time favorite is “Nobody Else.”

Harvard Happenings: Dins Anniversary Concert, March 29th, Sanders Theater. $12, $10 for groups
The Din & Tonics, one of Harvard’s all-male a cappella groups beloved for their on-stage antics and their lime green socks, will be hosting their 35th anniversary concert in Sanders Theater on the 29th. Although the Dins are known for their traditional jazzy style, in the last few years they have been branching out to more contemporary music, including songs from artists like Imogen Heap and Frank Ocean. No matter what, the Dins’ musicianship and stage presence will please both die-hard fans and newcomers to the Harvard a cappella scene – if anything, come for Dinpressions, where the Dins use their bodies to act out hilarious charades.
On The Radar: Avicii, April 10th @ 7:30, TD Garden. Tickets starting at $30.
