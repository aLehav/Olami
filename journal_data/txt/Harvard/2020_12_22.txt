Reimagined, up-tempo, stripped-down: Covers are only afforded so many critical designations. NNAMDÏ’s gorgeous cover of Boston-based artist Anjimile’s “Baby No More,” however, shrugs off easy classification. Far more than a derivative of the original, “Baby No More (NNAMDÏ’s Dream)” opens a dialogue that expands the possibilities of the song itself.
The original song, which Anjimile released in August as the second single off of his debut full-length “Giver Taker,” is exquisitely arranged, with a gentle guitar-picking loop that accompanies a lilting, deceptively catchy beat. The chorus opens up into a quick, electronic refrain that recalls the hypnotic melodies of Blood Orange or the best (and least convoluted) work of the Dirty Projectors. It’s a tight, sub-three-minute burst of buoyancy, a true highlight on an assured and world-weary debut album.
A NNAMDÏ cover of an Anjimile song makes sense, sort of. Anjimile, a self-identified “queer & trans songmaker / boy king,” emerged out of Boston’s college open-mic circuit; NNAMDÏ, who is constantly referred to as “genre-insert-destructive-adjective-ing,” has long made waves in Chicago’s DIY indie scene. Both released new music this year to critical acclaim and are teetering on the edge of indie stardom. Both are associated with Father/Daughter Records. And both are Black indie artists carving out space for themselves in a genre that is commercially dominated by and caters towards whiteness.
But NNAMDÏ’s sound has a trademark looseness, a cheeky resistance to musical trope or predictable melody. Anjimile, on the other hand, unfurls balanced, intricate compositions. His songs each feel complete, like perfectly calibrated gifts of lyricism and emotion. Their artistry could conflict, in theory. NNAMDÏ compromises, playing the song somewhat straight while gently fraying its edges. The result is a lush and emotionally affecting interpretation.
It should be noted that this cover, in a way, returns the song to its roots. Anjimile first released “Baby No More” in so-called acoustic form back in January 2019, with a guitar and simple harmony. It’s slower, longer; Anjimile’s tone is raspier. There is no hugely substantive musical difference between these three versions beyond the scale of the instrumentation. But listen to all three and it’s clear that they are by no means interchangeable.
NNAMDÏ’s version, technically, is a piano ballad. He caresses the keys like an overqualified hotel lounge singer as he croons through the first verse. (The artist’s multi-instrumental prowess is well-documented.) “Weary, but somehow I’m still alive,” he sings, sounding for a fleeting moment like the most timeless of piano balladeers.
At the crescendo points accented in the original by the sly insertion of synths, NNAMDÏ lets loose, only slightly, on the keys, building up the emotion in his voice in increments. The song’s lyrics suggest that the narrator has caused harm — “Mary / you know well I done you wrong,” “Am I / Not supposed to hurt you?” — but knows it, extracting themselves as an act of mutual, perhaps liberating mercy. Accordingly, a lightness pervades the cover, despite the slow tempo and melancholic chords.
Yet sadness encroaches, and two minutes later, by the final repetition of the “I can’t be your baby no more,” that formerly freeing centerpiece lyric has become weighed-down, even plaintive. As his voice gently trembles, NNAMDÏ taps into the pathos that by all accounts pervaded the song’s origin. The description of this cover on Anjimile’s Bandcamp reads: “‘Baby No More was written in the wake of a decision to leave a relationship in which the narrator was not the best version of themselves.” NNAMDÏ dances in tighter and tighter circles around the edges of that interior grief until, in the track’s waning seconds, he dives in. Perhaps it is ultimately his resistance to definition that allows him to shed all trappings of genre interpretation and crack open a song’s heart.
NNAMDÏ has produced three releases since March (all in the pandemic after-times) with another on the way. Next year he’ll be opening for Wilco and Sleater-Kinney on tour. This track captures an artist on the brink of explosion, taking a moment to hone in on the core of a peer’s equally uncompromising artistic vision. It’s a moment we’re lucky to catch.

There is an intimate universality reserved for stories with nameless characters.
In K-Ming Chang’s debut novel “Bestiary,” characters are defined not by their given names but by their surreal, otherworldly qualities. The speaker’s tiger tail, which begins to grow as she enters puberty, expands into an embodiment of protection, female sexuality, and matrilineal inheritance. A father and son, enmeshed in an abusive relationship, ascend to the sky like kites and tussle in the wind. The breathing, mythic holes in the speaker’s backyard conceal flashes of skin and scraps of words, serving as a dynamic intermediary between the speaker and her estranged ancestral past.
Chang’s story opens with her unnamed speaker recounting her family’s search for lost gold. From this collective — and largely futile — search for treasure emerges motifs of burial, reinvention, memory, and dispossession that serve as key threads in the novel’s broader textual fabric. An inward-facing, temporally non-linear narrative, Chang’s prose moves freely from past to present, daughter to mother, China to America to provide a sweeping, detailed portrayal of the psychic complexities of migration, loss, and love.
Two themes cohere Chang’s story: hunger and holes. Both convey a sense of profound emptiness that exemplifies the speaker’s interior restlessness. The holes in Chang’s narrative demonstrate the obscure ways in which life twists on itself, taking in the ordinary and spitting out the extraordinary. They also serve as sites of both burial and birth. As the speaker’s mother “Ma” admonishes, “You think burial is about finalizing what’s died. But burial is beginning: To grow anything, you must first dig a grave for its seed.” It is in these moments of thoughtful symbolism that Chang’s prose shines: Each image is intentional, and even the most radical literary choices make sense.
To reflect on Chang’s text without exploring its use of magical realism would be deeply remiss. Throughout the story, the literary technique illuminates dimensions of hunger, at once sources of depletion and vitality. The speaker’s hunger is cultural, sexual, and emotional: As Chang writes, “the price of having a body is hunger.” The myth of Hu Gu Po, a tiger spirit that seeks human vessels by slipping into the bodies of women, is a mythic tale that connects the women in the speaker’s ancestral line. Hunger manifests not merely as a drive to explore one’s sexuality or connect with others but, rather, as a visceral emptiness that emerges from displacement and solitude.
At its core, Chang’s is a story that affirms the ability of creative, unconventional language to enliven and elevate a text. Through weaving together multiple narrative voices and poeticizing her language, she challenges and at times even reimagines the potential of prose. At once a creation myth, genealogical record, and epistolary confession, Chang’s novel elucidates the unruly vitality of its characters while begging the questions: What is a story, anyway? How can one best preserve in writing the wildness and non-linearity of memory?
Chang’s text probes the physical and cultural effects of linguistic possession and, perhaps more importantly, dispossession. As the speaker reminisces on her mother’s past, she reflects, “Except Ma doesn’t measure her life in years but in languages: Tayal and Yilan Creole in the indigo fields where she was born blue-assed and fish-eyed, Japanese during the war, Mandarin in the Nationalist-eaten city.” A linguistic chronology runs through Ma’s life: She organizes her existence in seasons of tongues.
Chang’s text is also an exacting exploration of the body and its impulses. Deeply aware of how the body is often reduced to a site of shame and distrust, Chang works to counteract this cultural paradigm in her prose. She approaches the body as a somatic archive and employs animalistic symbolism as a means of underscoring the complexities of her speaker’s restive body: “Mothers ago, I was a beast. I stalked whole countries to eat. I plotted their shores with my teeth.”
The second epigraph for Chang’s novel — a quote by lauded Chinese-American writer Maxine Hong Kingston — reads, “There is detailed doubt here.” Indeed, Chang’s prose is at times uncannily reminiscent of Kingston’s literature, in particular her memoir “The Woman Warrior.” Both utilize magical realism as a means of accentuating the emotional and historical complexity of second-generation Chinese-American immigrants; both interweave mythologies of heroic women as foils for their young female protagonists.
In keeping with Kingston’s phrase “detailed doubt,” Chang employs her speaker’s ambivalence — toward her dual cultures, her family, her own body — as a means of poetic inquiry. However, there are times at which the rich prose seems overbearingly descriptive. Chang’s language, laden with imagery and lyrical diction, occasionally meanders, unsure of its direction or broader contextual function. Through her extended use of magical realism, everything becomes a metaphor. At times, one has to slash through semantics to grasp the narrative’s underlying ideas.
The story also occasionally lends itself to jarring fragmentation. Chang’s jumps in time, speaker, and geography periodically confound — the anonymity of her characters, though an essential literary choice, can render the prose cluttered and confused.
Ultimately, Chang succeeds in relating a deeply felt, richly poetic evocation of hunger, grief, and love. Hers is a text built not merely on the premise of trust but, equally important, on the creative potential of distrust. Through the surreal ways in which her speaker charts ways to understanding, Chang interrogates not merely what we know but how we arrive at knowledge itself. It is in these rich questions — ones that manifest in poems, magical holes, gossamer kites, and tiger tails — that the audacious, artful musicality of Chang’s prose stuns.

Nine Harvard affiliates, including four seniors at the College, were earlier this month named Schwarzman Scholars, an academic honor awarded to individuals interested in studying China and its relationship with the world.
The College students selected for the fellowship include Caleb A. Ren ’21, Tony Shu ’21, Henry R. “Hank” Sparks ’21, and Ryan Zhang ’21. They will be joined by Ariana L. Chaivaranon ’18, Harvard Medical School student Wan Fung Chui, Carlos E. Flores ’18, Molly K. Leavens ’19, and Harvard School of Education graduate Xiaoheng “Sally” Xu as members of the program’s sixth class of scholars.
Established by Harvard Business School alumnus Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2013, the scholarship finances a one-year Master’s program in Global Affairs at Schwarzman College, a residential college located within Tsinghua University in Beijing. This year, the program selected 154 scholars from 39 countries and 99 universities, out of more than 3,600 applicants, according to a Dec. 7 press release announcing the winners.
Though students accepted for the fellowship will enroll at Schwarzman College in August 2021, it remains unclear whether they will study in Beijing. The program has operated online since the outbreak of Covid-19.
Per the program’s website, candidates are expected to demonstrate excellence in areas such as leadership, academic aptitude, intercultural competency, and entrepreneurial spirit. To qualify, applicants must be between the ages of 18 and 29 and have an undergraduate degree or be on track to complete all degree requirements before Aug. 1 of their enrollment year.
Leavens, who pursued a self-designed concentration in food and the environment while at the College, said she met the news with great surprise.
“I was on my phone after a hike and driving with a friend, and I saw a missed call from an unknown number and I immediately thought it was them,” she said. “And then I saw a voicemail, and I listened to the voicemail, and I just screamed.”
Zhang, a Social Studies concentrator pursuing a citation in Chinese, said he felt thankful for those who supported him along the way.
“At first, it was disbelief. But then the disbelief quickly turned into profound gratitude. You know, I am because of others, and I thought about all the friends, family, and teachers who helped get me where I am today,” he said.
Several students selected for the program said they are interested in learning about China’s influence in their fields of study through the fellowship. Shu, who declared a special concentration in urban studies, highlighted in an email the growing relevance of China in global relations.
“Despite, or perhaps because of, the tensions between China and the United States, learning about and engaging with China is more important now than ever,” he wrote. “No matter what’s in store for my own future, I have a strong feeling that understanding China will help me become a more effective, empathetic, and versatile leader.”
Chaivaranon, who studied Visual and Environmental Studies — now called Art, Film, and Visual Studies — and History of Art and Architecture while attending the College, said she hopes to learn how to design museums that center the voices of local populations.
“China has been building hundreds of museums in the past decade, their arts scene is really growing — they’re the third largest art market in the world,” she said. “Learning more about how that more state-sponsored or state-controlled sector of the arts in China is consolidating a national visual identity will help me understand the way that the United States does that, but also my birth country, Thailand.”
Leavens said she intends to pursue her interests in global food systems and environmental sustainability as a Schwarzman Scholar. She underscored China’s role in shaping the future of the environment and developing countries’ agricultural systems.
“From an environmental perspective, you can’t address climate change without addressing China, not just because it obviously has the most people and is the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, but also because its power in the rest of the world,” she said.
Zhang said he looks forward to learning more about the “twin issues of poverty and inequality,” global challenges he believes will be “the defining issues of our time.”
“China, over the past couple of decades, has achieved significant progress on the poverty alleviation front,” he said. “I’m really excited about the courses available as part of the program where I’ll get to explore this phenomenon more deeply.”
Chaivaranon hopes her time as a Scholar will challenge and strengthen her understanding of global leadership in the 21st century.
“Great global leaders don’t set out by believing they’ll make global change,” she said. “So something I’m really interested in in this program is to get an international perspective, but also to learn how other folks are thinking about deep local accountability and bringing that to scale.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 24, 2020 at 8:55 p.m.
Students living in Harvard housing during winter recess, which officially began Monday, reported challenges adjusting to their temporary accommodations, such as moving dorms during a snowstorm.
The students remaining on campus — who include international students facing travel restrictions, students with health or safety concerns over travel, and students with challenging home environments — were notified of their winter break accommodations on Nov. 9 and moved into their new residences on Sunday.
Some students staying on campus over the break said they encountered difficulties moving into their assigned winter housing units.
“Move-in was definitely difficult with the snow and the cold,” Robert J. S. Malate ’21 said. “We were told that we had to basically clear out of our dorms and take all of our things to our new dorms, which definitely was much more difficult.”
Normally, students do not have to completely vacate their fall housing for winter break because they return to the same dorms in the spring. This year, the College could not guarantee students they would have the same housing assignment for both the fall and spring semester, according to Malate.
Ralph R. Estanboulie ’21 said some of the temporary housing assignments “did not seem very efficient.”
“A lot of people that are in River [East] like myself — I’m in Leverett House — got Fairfax or Hampden Hall, which is right next to the Yard. A lot of people that were already in Fairfax or Adams or close to the Yard got assigned DeWolfe,” Estanboulie said. “River [East] people could have easily gone to DeWolfe, it would have been an easy move. But for some reason they didn’t do that.”
David Y. Zhang ’23, who moved from Lowell House to DeWolfe, said he spent several days helping his friends living in Quad, which is nearly a mile from Harvard Yard, plan their moves to houses closer to the Charles River.
“I’m speaking with my mostly Quad friends who are still on campus and just talking about how they’ll be getting, like, I don’t know, 15 boxes from the Quad [to Dewolfe],” Zhang said. “I’m just thinking whether or not it’ll fit in one Uber, or whether or not it’ll be in two.”
“The whole process will, one, take money and, two, be really complicated,” he added.
Zhang said he and his friends were “very glad” when the College announced Friday it would provide a moving truck to help students living in the Quad move their belongings to dorms near Harvard Square.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22 said he was “lucky” he only had to move roughly two blocks from Quincy House to Hampden Hall, which is located atop the Harvard Book Store on Massachusetts Avenue.
“I ended up just moving my packages between Quincy and Hampden Hall, using a suitcase I had, and I just put bags of my stuff in the suitcase and shuttled back and forth,” Cheng said. “I was lucky in that I didn’t have to move that far.”
Though he said he was “pleasantly surprised” with the size of his room, Cheng said it did not have heating.
“When I woke up this morning, it was below 50 degrees, which is super cold,” he said. “I’m sure they’re gonna fix it, but it was a bit surprising.”
House administrators from Cabot House and Adams House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other students reported problems with Crimson Cash, a payment account attached to students’ ID cards that they can use to make purchases at certain on and off-campus establishments. The College offered students living on campus over the break a $30 per day Crimson Cash stipend for expenses.
“Me and my group of friends, we went to different locations that said they do accept Crimson Cash,” Malate said. “But every time we went there, it said ‘Oh, the machine’s broken,’ or ‘We currently don’t accept,’ or something like that, and that’s been very frustrating to be honest.”
Cheng said he was “very grateful” for the daily stipend. Still, he said he would prefer to eat food from one of Harvard’s dining halls, all of which are closed during winter recess.
“I do wish that they kept a dining hall open,” he said. “Personally I’m going to try to save as much of the Crimson Cash as I can because I’m also gonna have to pay for laundry and printing whenever they reopen the printers, and I know there are other students who are trying to save that $900 as well.”
One student, Andrew Y.J. Kim ’22, said he went without lunch Sunday because Crimson Cash did not work at the vendors he called.
“I was hoping to get lunch today, but so far I haven’t been able to eat a meal today because the places I’ve called do not accept Crimson Cash,” Kim said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that “due to the fluidity of students’ plans, winter housing logistics were very complex.” Dane also wrote that Campus Services communicated with vendors to ensure that Crimson Cash was working properly, and that students with concerns about heating should inform the appropriate contact on the Dean of Students Office website.
Even with those challenges, some students said they are excited to spend winter break on campus, including the possibility of College-sponsored programming and socializing with friends.
“I don't know whether they are online or whether they’re socially distanced outside or something, but they did send us a survey to ask what we’d like to see for programming,” Yoseph D. Boku ’21 said.
Other students expressed gratitude to the College for extending housing to students in between semesters of a challenging year.
“Generally I think I’m grateful, and I think I speak for other, especially international students, when I say it’s really generous for Harvard to have people over winter break, especially even during this pandemic,” Kim said.
CORRECTION: December 24, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Andrew C. Kim '23 went without lunch due to problems with Crimson Cash and expressed gratitude to the College for extending winter break housing to students. In fact, Andrew Y.J. Kim '22 made those statements.
