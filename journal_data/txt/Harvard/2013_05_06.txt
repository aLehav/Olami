After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are only four quatrains of lyrics in “At Last,” a blues song made popular by Etta James, but performers in the HRDC production of “At Last” parsed the sparse lines into bits, scribbling words with chalk onto the black walls and floor of the Loeb Ex. The production, a plot-driven dance show that played that until May 4, invited engagement in each storyline by staging the dances in, around, and above a standing, wandering audience. Though some of the staging choices made by director and choreographer Hazel A. Lever ’13 seemed superfluous, her overall clever staging and the agile, accessible movements of the performers made the whole show incredibly enjoyable.
Backed up by six musicians playing an equal parts sultry and adventurous score composed by Danielle G. Rabinowitz ’14, the performance was reminiscent of Walt Disney’s Fantasia, with the careful, intentional movements of the performers accompanying corresponding musical riffs and instrumental dialogue. As two girls (Mariel N. Pettee ’14 and Madison M. Dildine ’16) flirted on a park bench, their angular, shy twitching and fitful smiles were enhanced by by a jazzy, spunky section of music. One of the most impressive parts of the show, Rabinowitz’s score propelled the various plotlines and maintained an incredible level of energy throughout the production.
Since each storylines was so different, it was particularly remarkable that the music was able to evolve with and enhance the relationships being portrayed on stage. Some parts felt like a play off of “Cell Block Tango” from the musical “Chicago,” with four of the female dancers (Sofie A. R. Seymour ’15, Nina M. Yancy ’13, Melanie J. Comeau ’13, and Talia M. Fox ’13) up on the balcony, emoting the same anguish over an unfaithful lover (Kevin Shee) through synchronized dance moves. Each female dancer wore a button-down shirt, presumably from the same man they had all encountered, and the scene started out as individual morning-after moments, until the performers seemed to realize their hurt and anger, and then began to mirror each other’s movements.
Lever’s choice to have each of the dancers wear the same shirt was emotional, and felt like the narrative was reaching for a more substantial statement about relationships. Other choices, however, seemed a bit forced. For example, the one singer in the production, an incredible vocalist named Page Axelson, interrupted the scenes three times to sing a slightly different rendition of “At Last.” The first time was moving, and set the mood and theme of the play quite well. The second rendition, complete with an obligatory cigarette and glass of scotch, felt forced, and though Axelson belted the lyrics through pent-up frustration and sarcastic head tosses, the intended reinterpretation of the words in the song was confusing and seemed to overtly herald what was otherwise a carefully chosen progression of scenes and climactic dances. Each of the couples’ interactions, whether it was the charming, smitten boy (Matthew W. G. Walker ’16) and disinterested girl (Yancy), or the sexy, almost matador dances of Comeau and Ivo B. Baca ’13, felt so honest and engaging. However, the decision to focus the beginning and the end of the performance on the unfulfilling narrative of the unfaithful lover and cast-aside girlfriend (Fox) felt odd when compared to such a varied and important selection of scenes.
This is not to say that the few confusing choices took away from the rest of the production. Rather, the rest of the show was incredibly meaningful and impressively fluid from the moment that the audience stumbled into the theater. Immediately the performers were invested in their parts, and each wrote a certain section of the lyrics repeatedly throughout the space, only to erase, revise, and rewrite the lyrics at different points throughout the show. Though the theatergoers stood inches from some of the performers, the performers themselves did not flinch but rather kept in character, even when ushering the clumsy audience out of the way when, as occurred several times during the performance, the raised platforms had to be rolled to a different location, often exactly where the audience had been standing seconds before.
All of these movement went on without a hitch, and what could have been a disorienting attempt at immersion succeeded fantastically. The warm toned, practical lighting by Joseph R. Seering ’13 indicated where the audience was supposed to turn, though often multiple stages in the couples’ relationship took place at the same time. There were breakups on the left, a besotted duo on the right, and playful friendly interactions behind. The varied relationships reached a climax at one moment in the middle of the production when all nine performers herded the audience into one group and danced around them, chant-like and circular as the lights narrowed on the unsuspecting theatergoers. The message was clear; relationships are all-consuming, emotional, and there’s no way to avoid the glaring reality of love.

Hey, sexy people of Harvard! Break out those dance moves we know you've been working on in front of the mirror for months. You could have the chance to see the man responsible for the Gangnam Style craze in the flesh.
Psy, the South Korean artist of ridiculously viral video fame, will speak during a special ticketed event in Tsai Auditorium on Thursday, where Professors Alexander Zahlten and Carter J. Ecker will join in conversation with the artist. (We at Flyby do hope that by "converse" they actually mean lead a private Gangnam Style dance tutorial.) Tickets for the event are being lotteried through Monday night at 5 p.m.
Psy, who frequently sports salmon shorts and tuxedos in his music videos, should fit right in with a major subset of the male population at Harvard. Hey, maybe he'll even get a shout out on the most popular Tumblr to hit Harvard spring!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester, Tara Raghuveer ‘14 and Jennifer Zhu ‘14 ran for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President on a platform that called on the University, among other things, to consider the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality as a department. Harvard’s upcoming capital campaign, which has received great coverage in The Crimson during the past week, seemsa fitting path to a department of gender studies.
There are many parts of the capital campaign that deserve and in fact require student input. (For example, I’m confused by the notion that funding priorities that don’t excite donors “are tweaked or eliminated during the vetting process”—what about funding parts of this University that may not excite Harvard’s wealthiest donors?) But for this column, I would like to focus on the implications of one possible funding target. What would a WGS department mean for the role of feminist and queer thought in our university?
As an undergraduate WGS concentrator, I would of course love WGS to receive department affiliation. The arguments for a WGS department are compelling. Currently, the Committee on Degrees in the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality has none of its own graduate students—and also has no permanent faculty. My professors either hold joint appointments with other departments, meaning that they must split their time and intellectual commitments with other social sciences and humanities, or they are visiting faculty. This gives the concentration little continuity and means that there is little research published from Harvard that focuses solely on gender or sexuality. It also means that WGS is dependent on other departments to decide if they want their faculty to take joint appointments with WGS. Currently, there are no feminist economists or feminist philosophers offering classes regularly in the WGS concentration. Despite the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus’s amazing work to establish the F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality and despite the popularity of WGS General Education classes like Robin Bernstein’s “Race, Gender, and Performance” and Caroline Light’s “Sex and the Citizen,” it often feels as if WGS is figuratively as well as literally shunted off into the University’s basement.
Hundreds of students are introduced to feminist theory through WGS classes each year, but few take more than a couple of WGS classes. I, like most of my WGS classmates, am a joint concentrator. The feminist philosophy of science I have read in my tutorials complements and broadens the understanding of the history of science that I study in other classes, but Harvard has not recently offered any class like “Feminism 101.” If WGS were a department, it could hire its own faculty, allowing the concentration to expand the number of departmental classes, including foundational classes.
Women’s studies was originally formulated as a critique of dominant thought in the University. The students who formed the original Committee on Women’s Studies in the 1970s to work toward a women’s studies program at Harvard declared, “Most theories upon which Harvard’s courses are based have been developed by men, who have studied men’s roles in society...Women’s Studies is needed to re-evaluate such theories.” In the years since its founding in 1987, the committee has added “gender” and “sexuality” to its purview, incorporating feminist and queer critique about the intersection of race, gender, class, and power in societies around the world. What, then, would a purely feminist syllabus look like? Most feminist writing is critique—critiques of Marx and Freud, critiques of biology and medicine, critiques of literature and sociology. Requiring all undergraduates to read Freud just so that they can understand canonical feminist critiques of Freud seems to defeat the purpose of WGS in the first place.
Perhaps, then, the purpose of having a WGS department is just so that freshmen need not have to read Freud. Once WGS can hire its own faculty and produce its own research, it can also participate in the production of its own epistemology. Is this not what the students of the 1970s wanted—a world in which courses base their theories on the writings of women, people of color, indigenous people, workers, queers?
On the other hand, perhaps becoming an established part of the academic institution would cripple the great strength of feminist and queer theory: its ability to question established modes of reasoning. What does a discipline so used to being excluded from spaces of power—in fact, a discipline built up on critique of the institutions of power—do when it is offered a seat at the table?
I don’t yet have good answers to these questions. Of course, as of now, this discussion is moot. Harvard may never have a WGS department unless the administration makes a real commitment to raising money for that purpose during the capital campaign, which they likely will not do unless students and student governments continue to make clear that WGS is a priority for us. As a member of the undergraduate Capital Campaign Task Force, I am excited to convey to Harvard the depth of student and community excitement about funding a WGS department.  But, as is true for all fundraising goals, it is important for the students, faculty, researchers, and teachers of WGS to consider and debate what, exactly, a feminist department would mean.

If you reach for the sky, first try not to let it fall. Over the next 10 years, President Obama announced during his State of the Union address, the United States will spend $3 billion on the Brain Activity Map Project, a grand, new, inspiring research initiative to map in detail every neuron of the human brain. Earlier this semester, Riley K. Carney ’15 praised the decision in a euphoric op-ed, concluding that “investment in exploration, scientific understanding, and progress is exactly the kind of legacy our government should seek to leave behind.”
Since that announcement, a recent development has decidedly darkened its predecessor. Over the next 10 years, the United States will not only spend $3 billion mapping the brain, but it will also aimlessly ax $1.2 trillion of spending elsewhere—$85 billion by October. Much of the slashed spending will come from what once funded basic research. The federal government is the largest provider of research grants in the country by a remarkably large margin; Harvard has received over $650 million for research this last fiscal year.
All three of Harvard’s largest funding providers, The National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Department of Defense, among others, will see significant cuts. In the Washington Post, former NIH director Elias Zerhouni explained that because the average research grant ends only after five years, “because science is like that,” only 20 percent of grant funding opens up annually. Of that, half plows back into projects seeing successful results, leaving only 10 percent to fund new projects and an even smaller portion for new projects from new, younger scientists, the students Harvard is tasked to train. “We are going to maim our innovation capabilities,” Zerhouni stated. “It will impact science for generations to come.”
Carney’s op-ed began by optimistically contrasting the Brain Activity Map Project against recent recurring headlines of “debt crises” and “congressional gridlock,” and a “government [that] appears broken, dysfunctional, and without any long-term vision”. Congressional gridlock: check. A body politic bifurcated, boozy, and myopic: with pained reluctance, check. We pulled out a celebration bottle too early. Keep drinking, but for different reasons.
The rhetoric surrounding Obama’s Brain Activity Map project wishfully compares it to past scientific successes—John F. Kennedy’s historic 1961 proclamation that we would put a man on the moon and the Human Genome Project, which cost $3.8 billion over 13 years and, according to a federal government study, generated $796 billion returns and 310,000 jobs.
However, a brain is not a genome. The Brain Activity Map Project will not be the Human Genome Project. HGP knew G, A, T, and C, the base nucleotides that make DNA, and tried to find out how many and in what ways they combine in humans’ full hereditary codes. It knew what it was after and had a clear sense of how that could be achieved.
More importantly, the genome had 20,000-25,000 genes to map. An average brain has, in its lowest estimates, over 85 billion neurons. However, BAM does not refer to an old NIH project that intended to map a static brain. The Brain Activity Map wants to do exactly what it sounds like: map brain activity, the trillions of connections between those many billions of neurons over time. To do this, some propose we will need to advance the field of nanotechnology to create “fleets of molecule-size machines to noninvasively act as sensors to measure and store brain activity at the cellular level.”
Even once we can collect all this data, numerous petabytes, each a quadrillion one-or-zero bits, on giant hard drives, there remains the question of how to interpret them. Quadrillions of pieces of information cannot be simply handed to teams of scientists to wade through. The data will require intelligent, multi-faceted tools and methods of analysis that relate the activity map to the real world, its developmental, social, clinical, and other implications and applications.
For all its difficulty, a more complex goal, less money, and an earlier completion date, BAM may yet equal or surpass HGP’s success. It may promise giant leaps for mankind, as JFK once promised, and reward high returns in both social and economic dimensions, as one of Harvard’s own, Harvard Medical School Professor George M. Church, who will lead the project, has argued strongly and valiantly.
Describing the loftiness of BAM’s ambitions is important because BAM represents Washington’s ideals. BAM is scientific research that for all its cost and uncertainty our politicians applaud. Sequestration, on the other hand, is Washington’s antithetical reality. Scientific research nationwide will be slashed in a self-mutilation that was never supposed to happen and with a more competent Congress, never would have.
In his State of the Union address, President Obama spoke, “Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation.” It certainly is not. While we cut everything else, let’s cut the contradiction. Before we can understand the brain, our government must use it.

When African American baseball player Jackie Robinson signed onto the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1946, he shattered the color barrier that had segregated Major League Baseball for over 60 years. Even before the civil rights movement, Robinson’s courage enabled African American baseball players to play alongside whites. In the 1940s, American sports led the cultural charge that ultimately ended segregation and extended African Americans full legal equality. And last week, when Jason Collins came out as the first openly gay player in the NBA, professional sports have once again shown the potential to have a positive impact on American cultural values.
Collins may not be the first American athlete to come out, but he is the first to do so while competing on a professional team. Nearly 20 years before Collins, five-time Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis came out and announced that he had been diagnosed with HIV. Last year, former NFL defensive back Wade Davis came out, noting that he waited until retirement because he wanted to be known as an NFL player—not as a gay person. And just last month, former Baylor University basketball star and number one WNBA draft pick Brittney Griner publicly discussed her sexuality. Clearly it is not the case that there are no gay athletes in American professional sports; rather, stigmatization deters these athletes from speaking openly about their sexuality while continuing to compete professionally.
The effect of professional athletes coming out is certain to make it easier for all athletes—aspiring, current, and retired—who have been deterred from speaking about their sexuality. But in America—where support for same-sex marriage has grown rapidly over the past decade and where 3.4 percent of people self-identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender—it is shocking that it has taken this long for American sports to embrace an openly gay athlete. Indeed, given the overwhelmingly positive response to Collins’ announcement, it is apparent that the American sports world has lagged behind the American public in creating a culture of acceptance for gay Americans.
But in 2013, as in 1946, American sports have been given the opportunity to make a positive impact on American cultural values. We applaud the bravery of Jason Collins to speak openly about his sexuality, and moving forward, we hope to see this positive discourse continue and spark a trend of openness and acceptance both in professional sports and in American culture as a whole. It took only one man’s courage to open up the MLB to African Americans in 1946; we hope that it will only take one man’s courage to open up all sports to gay athletes in 2013.

While you might expect me to opine right now about U.S. politics or Harvard policies, today I do not take issue with Congress or with the Harvard administration. Rather, I take issue with the English language. For a brief moment, I’d like to shift the focus away from arguments that are pro-war, pro-choice, pro-Obama, or pro-guns, and address another important issue: pro-nouns.
The English language lacks a proper third-person singular gender-neutral pronoun that can be used to describe a person. By that mess of grammatical jargon, I mean that there is no word that functions as a gender-neutral alternative to the words “he” and “she.” It is my firm belief that the word “they” should serve this function.
Often, a writer will reach a grammatical road-block when…the writer…reaches a point in a sentence in which…the writer… has to use a pronoun to identify an individual whose gender is not specified.
Had I just now replaced “the writer” with “they,” my sentence would have read far more smoothly. Yet had I done that, my editors might have accused me of being grammatically incorrect. But sentences such as, “If a student misbehaves, they should be punished,” flow naturally and are easily understood. The general consensus that such sentences are grammatically incorrect is misguided and unnecessary. Because no better alternative exists, we should come to accept such usage of the word “they” as correct.
The other options available to fill this grammatical void are far worse. Using only the word he (“If a student misbehaves, he should be punished”) shows gender bias. Using only the word she (“If a student misbehaves, she should be punished”) is overcompensation that still shows favoritism toward one gender. Using “s/he” or “he or she” is wordy and unnatural, especially if used frequently or spoken out loud. Some writers instead choose to alternate between he and she (“If a student misbehaves, he should be punished. Or, she should apologize.”) Yet this can be confusing, as it sounds like a writer referring to one person is actually referring to two. Blogger GrammarGirl appropriately refers to this practice as “whiplash grammar.”
Others have turned to inventing their own pronouns. Students at Wesleyan University, for example, have pushed for the inclusion of the word “ze” as a gender-neutral pronoun that students may choose to identify themselves with. Other alternatives include “han,” “thon,” and “co.” Yet these words won’t and haven’t caught on universally, and sound awkward. There is no reason to artificially invent a new word when an existing word is already used frequently in casual conversation.
As of right now, the Chicago Manual of Style recognizes the singular “they” as common in casual contexts, but not in formal writing. Instead, the manual offers a list of ways to rephrase sentences in order to avoid the need for a singular pronoun. This is another ineffective solution. The fact that writers must rework sentences, often in unnatural ways, in order to avoid the need for a word that doesn’t exist is further proof that English requires such a word.
The need to find a proper gender-neutral pronoun is also important because of the growing recognition that some people’s preferred gender pronouns are not simply “he” and “she.” In fact, some people who identify outside the male-female gender binary choose the word “they” as their PGP.
Yet independent of PGPs, the singular use of “they” should be allowed for the sake of grammar alone. Grammatical rules should exist to make language easier to understand. The singular use of “they” is common in casual conversation and makes sentences both easier to construct and more concise. Thus, insistence that we continue to consider it grammatically incorrect is arbitrary insistence on an illogical rule.
I’m not arguing that we should fail to adhere to this rule while it exists, but rather that the rule itself should not exist. Some writers can choose to use the singular “they” in less formal contexts where they have that sort of discretion. For the time being, though, when writing academic papers I will continue to artificially pluralize my sentences or limit my usage of pronouns in order to adhere to the current consensus against the singular “they.” Yet I also hope that eventually, such a consensus will disappear, and that style and grammar manuals will subsequently accommodate the change.

House Master candidates Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant, and their eight year old son Jamie, visited Pforzheimer House on Friday evening to engage with the students they may soon oversee.
With current House Masters Nicholas A. Christakis and Erika L. Christakis ’86 departing for Yale this summer after a four-year stint, the College is searching for a new family to take the reigns at Pfoho.
They are being “strongly considered” as new House Masters, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote in a message to Pfoho students.
Harrington serves as the Director for Undergraduate Studies in the History of Science Department and Durant is the MIT Museum Director. The pair also leads a Harvard Summer School class in Cambridge, England that involves interacting with students in a residential setting.
“Anne and I have been doing summer school together [for Harvard] and enjoy doing that,” Durant explained. “It partly made us interested [in the role].”
The couple had preliminary conversations about serving as House Masters a few years ago. Earlier this year, College administrators contacted them to ask if they would still be interested in the role, according to Harrington.
“I’ve thought for several years that this might be a good fit,” she said.
Harrington and Durant both said they were particularly interested in Pfoho.
“I love Pfoho. We really like the Quad,” she said. “I love its sense of peaceful self-containment.”
Harrington added that she has a special connection to Pfoho. Suzanne Watts, current Pfoho House Administrator, served as Quincy House’s House Administrator when Harrington lived there as an undergraduate.
Students had a chance to mingle with the potential House Masters at Pfoho Friday, a weekly hour-long House social event.
Students who met Harrington on Friday said they were impressed.
“She’s a really accomplished woman,” Eric Lu ’14 said. “She definitely could be a great role model for a lot of people.”
Tanner A. Anderson ’15, a Pfoho resident who is enrolled in Harrington’s History of Science sophomore tutorial, said the professor’s enthusiasm and understanding as an instructor would carry over to the role of House Master.
“I think she’s awesome,” he said. “I definitely like her as a choice to take over the role of House Master after the Christakises leave.”
Pfoho residents can submit feedback on Harrington and Durant, which Pfoho Resident Dean Lisa Boes, will send to Hammonds.
The two will have to go through additional interviews before a final decision is made.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School are watching angry flies fight for the advancement of science. In a new study published last month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, Harvard researchers found that two pairs of dopamine-producing neurons in fruit flies may be exclusively linked with aggressive behavior.
The research team used a set of genetic tools to manipulate individual brain cells in the flies. According to Olga V. Alekseyenko, the study’s first author and Harvard Medical School postdoctoral fellow, these techniques allow researchers to “express whatever you want, wherever you want in the brain.”
The researchers isolated dopamine-producing, or dopaminergic, neurons in the brains of Drosophila, the genus of fruit flies. Then, using a genetically encoded neurotransmitter inhibitor and a temperature-sensitive neuronal activator, the researchers were able to selectively activate and deactivate these neurons. The team then measured aggression in the flies by examining the intensity of fights between males over prizes like a food cup or a female.
“By turning on the dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila we found escalated intensity of fights between socially naïve males,” Alekseyenko said.
The researchers also found that deactivating these dopaminergic neurons increased aggressive behavior. Researchers found that while activating and deactivating these dopaminergic neurons affected Drosophila’s aggression, other aspects of the fruit flies’ behavior remained undisturbed.
“Both neurons are exclusively involved in aggression and holding aggression in check,” said Neurobiology professor Edward A. Kravitz, who is lead author of the study. This discovery could have important implications for organisms more complex than fruit flies, according to Kravitz.
“Dopamine is also involved in the motivation and reward systems in humans and higher vertebrates,” said Kravitz. “We want to understand how amines like serotonin and dopamine actually function in a circuitry relating to behavior. By finding the fundamental principles of how they work in the cells of Drosophila we hope to eventually model how they work in humans."

Timothy Williamson was named Harvard’s permanent Director of Athletic Communications on Thursday after serving in the role on an interim basis for three months. Williamson succeeds previous director Kurt K. Svoboda, who became the Senior Assistant Athletic Director at Stanford University in February.
“I’m very happy to be in this role,” Williamson said. “We have a great staff in our office, and I’m happy to continue to be a member of the Athletic Department.”
Williamson has been with Harvard since 2007, when he came to Cambridge after serving as an assistant director of media relations for Columbia University. He has overseen the social media outreach of the Athletic Department and currently serves on the Social Media and Student-Athlete Development committees in the department.
Senior Associate Director of Athletics Patricia Henry, who headed the search committee for the position, said that she was impressed with how Williamson handled his transition into the interim position in the middle of the winter sports season.“He had to balance a lot of things, some things he had never dealt with before,” Henry said. “He did a terrific job.”
Henry also noted Williamson’s work on the national level, particularly as the media coordinator for the men’s lacrosse and fencing NCAA championships and as the sports information director for men’s basketball during its NCAA Tournament appearances. She said that the search committee reviewed between 50 and 60 applications for the position.
“We had a lot of interest, a fair amount of experience in the candidate pool, so it was an opportunity for us to look at a number of different candidates from different backgrounds [and] experiences, and to compare them against one another,” Henry said. “Tim did very well with his competition and really in the end showed that he could definitely handle this.”
Williamson said that he will focus on Harvard’s role in helping the Ivy League create a conference-wide sports network. The conference announced plans on April 26 to consolidate the online streaming of Ancient Eight games onto a single website.
“That’s going to be the first big order of business, maintaining that and growing that going forward,” Williamson said.

At the end of a year marked by several high-profile top-down administrative decisions, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will dedicate a large portion of its final monthly meeting Tuesday to a broad discussion of its relationship with administrators.
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the vice-chair of the Faculty Docket Committee, will lead the docketed discussion, which is expected to touch on consultation, communication, and governance of the University’s flagship faculty.
In a memo addressed to faculty last Friday, Jasanoff pointed to developments in the Harvard library system, Allston, and HarvardX, which have been imposed on faculty in the past year without first receiving their input.
But in recent months faculty members have suggested that list is even longer. From the decision to move the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to the adjudication of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, and culminating with revelations that administrators authorized secret email searches that violated FAS email privacy policy, faculty members have said that they are being excluded from the University decision-making process in which they have such a large stake.
“Though the FAS holds a monthly meeting of the Faculty, has a Faculty Council that meets twice monthly, and dozens of faculty committees, there has been a sense that the lines of communication between the faculty and the administration are not as effective as they might be, and that existing forums do not provide sufficient opportunity to discuss or respond to issues bearing on the FAS that originate outside or extend beyond it,” Jasanoff wrote in the memo.
Though the discussion Tuesday will be the first by the faculty as a whole, a number of professorial groups have experimented with alternative bodies in the past year. Most recently, faculty organized a town hall-style meeting to discuss changes to the reading and examination periods. Before that, faculty complaints over proposed changes to University rules governing professors’ activities outside of Harvard led administrators to create an online forum for faculty members to share their thoughts and suggestions regarding the proposal.
Jasanoff proposed several discussion questions that faculty might consider about the effectiveness of monthly faculty meetings, the way FAS weighs in on University-wide issues, and on the way that professors raise concerns to administrators. The latter point will likely include an evaluation of the two most-recent experiments.
“We can explore the effectiveness of these experiments and brainstorm other ways to facilitate communication between the faculty and the administration,” Jasanoff wrote.
The discussion is only one of four docketed items on Tuesday’s agenda, though. As is typical at the end of each semester, faculty will also vote on three proposals, wrapping up administrative business before the summer recess. This time around, those votes will include approval of the FAS and University Extension School course catalogs for the 2013-2014 academic year, as well as a proposal to change the way reading and examination periods work. If the new handbook language is approved, Reading Period will be shortened by a day, and all final projects and papers will be due during a renamed and lengthened “Final Examination and Project Period.”
The Faculty Council discussed all three measures at its meeting last week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the face of international criticism, Harvard History professor Niall Ferguson apologized for his comments about John Maynard Keynes’ sexual orientation and its relation to his economic theories, prompting mixed reactions from the Harvard community.
Ferguson, whose past statements have created controversy, alleged at a recent conference in California that the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes were unsound because Keynes was gay and childless and, therefore, not concerned about the future.
In an apology posted on his blog Saturday, Ferguson wrote that his remarks were part of an “off-the-cuff response” and not part of his official presentation.
“My disagreements with Keynes’s economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation. It is simply false to suggest, as I did, that his approach to economic policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal life,” Ferguson wrote in the statement. “As those who know me and my work are well aware, I detest all prejudice, sexual or otherwise.”
Ferguson added that his remarks were “as stupid as they were insensitive.”
Griffin T. Gaffney ’13, an intern at the Harvard College Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said that the administration’s handling of the issue may have important implications regarding its support of the LGBTQ community. He said he hopes that the University will release an official statement regarding the matter, but added that he thinks that would be unlikely.
“This is a great example of the University not being responsive toward issues of gender and sexuality,” said Gaffney. “Historically, we haven’t really had a campus that is in tune with these kinds of issues.”
W. Powell Eddins ’16, a political co-chair in Harvard’s Queer Students and Allies, said that Ferguson’s comments may not reflect Harvard broadly, but that they point to lingering prejudices against the LGBTQ community.
“I think [this incident] is reflective of the fact that discrimination against the LGBTQ community in general is still pervasive in our society, even in places as progressive as Harvard,” he said. Still, Eddins said that he believes Ferguson’s apology may be a sign that prejudice is becoming less acceptable.
English professor Louis Menand said that the controversy was an academic integrity issue and not a matter of political concern.
“In historical inquiry, it is perfectly acceptable to use biographical information to explain an idea or a theory,” Menand wrote in an email to The Crimson. “It is unacceptable to rely on a stereotype or an unproven generalization, which is why Professor Ferguson retracted [his statement]. The matter has nothing to do with gay rights.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a three-part series on gender disparity issues at the Law School. Part II ran on May 8, and Part III ran on May 10.
Just 20 percent of U.S. senators are female. Women make up a mere 21.6 percent of the lawyers who serve as general counsels to Fortune 500 companies. Only three of the nine Supreme Court Justices are women.
But these figures are still higher than the proportion of women within the ranks of the Harvard Law School faculty.
At Elizabeth Warren and Elena Kagan’s former place of work, women constitute fewer than a fifth of all professors and assistant professors of law—a disparity that Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow called “absolutely inadequate.” With only 17 women among 92 tenure-track faculty members, according to the Law School’s online directory as of May 6,  the gender imbalance of Harvard Law School’s faculty is comparable to that of other elite law schools, yet still among the most severe of the approximately 200 law schools nationwide.
Concerns about gender inequality have spread throughout campus as a new student-run coalition called Shatter the Ceiling draws hundreds of community members together to address these issues, faculty members pursue research on gender disparities, and the administration pushes for new strategies to level the playing field. Amidst this growing movement, some have raised questions about the impact of gender inequality within the ranks of the faculty, in the classroom, in student organizations, and in life after Law School.
Among their top concerns is the small proportion of women on the faculty, an issue they say is rooted in the Law School’s history and today impacts hiring decisions, faculty conversations, and topics of intellectual inquiry.
“It’s an issue that matters to me, an issue that matters to the Law School, and an issue that matters to the profession,” Minow said.
BURDENED BY THE PAST
Portraits of tenured professors arranged in chronological order line a wing of the Law School’s new student center, looking down on students as they walk to class each day. But students cannot see a woman’s photograph until they pass the 1972 mark, and can only count a handful more in the next few decades.
More than 20 years after female students first stepped foot on campus, the Law School in 1972 granted tenure to its first female faculty member, Elisabeth A. Owens. But she did not attend faculty meetings, and her appointment “was widely regarded as not genuine,” according to Daniel R. Coquillette, a visiting professor and the former dean of Boston College Law School.
Coquillette is currently working on a history of Harvard Law School that will devote a significant section to the history of gender at the school. He said that the Law School’s progress on gender issues came relatively late, after other law schools across the country had already taken significant steps towards welcoming women.
“The appointment of women to the tenured faculty is so recent that many of the pioneer women are still right there as active faculty members,” Coquillette said, referring particularly to Law School professors Martha A. Field ’65 and Elizabeth Bartholet ’62, two of the first women to successfully complete the tenure process.
Field recounted that when she first joined the faculty as a tenured professor in 1979, the Law School had “such a terrible reputation” among women in the field.
“It used to be a nice male club,” she said. “It really did sort of mess up the boys’ club when women came on.”
Field said that in the early years, the hiring of female faculty members was slowed by concerns about tilting the political direction of the school leftward.
“For a while, you sort of had the feeling that it was hard to hire women because people had one idea of what a woman should be,” Field said. “They assumed that if you pushed for women or minorities that you were leftist, radical, and pushy.”
Since that time, acceptance of female faculty members has improved—a development highlighted by the appointment of two female deans, Kagan in 2003 and Minow in 2009. But Minow herself acknowledges that these changes are still not enough.
“Now we have women serving as partners at law firms, on the Supreme Court, making a difference in all walks of legal life,” Minow said in a March interview. “On the other hand, the small relative number of women who are partners at law firms, sit on the bench, and are tenured professors shows that there’s still lots to be done.”
ADDING MORE PORTRAITS
At less than 20 percent female, Harvard Law School’s tenure-track faculty is the least diverse of its kind in the Ivy League. At Columbia Law School, about 25 percent of faculty members are female, while women make up about 29 percent of the faculty at Yale Law School. The law schools at Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania count even more female faculty members among their ranks, with percentages of about 30 and 33, respectively.
Outside the Ivy League, female law professors are represented in even greater numbers. According to a report released by the Association of American Law Schools, women accounted for 34.4 percent of law school faculty nationwide in the 2008-2009 academic year.
“In terms of our peer [top-ranked] schools we are not so different,” Minow said, noting that the Law School does not fare as well when compared to a broader group of schools. “So it’s again the same pattern you see all over the profession. The higher the prestige, the more elite, the fewer women are there.”
Since she took the helm of the school four years ago, Minow has worked to change these numbers. Her first step: hiring equal numbers of men and women for entry-level faculty positions since 2009. This year, the Law School has made two hiring offers, one to a man and one to a woman.
Annually, the entry-level hiring committee conducts about 40 interviews, which are balanced in terms of gender breakdown. From these initial interviews, the hiring committee whittles down the pool of potential candidates, who must present to a faculty workshop, secure the recommendation of the hiring committee, and finally secure the approval of the faculty as a whole before they are hired. All the while, the hiring committee is careful to retain an equal number of male and female candidates, according to Law School professor David J. Barron ’89, chair of the entry-level committee.
The goal of having more female faculty members is “very much part of the consciousness, and consciousness matters,” said Barron, a former Crimson president. “There’s no reason that our faculty should not be more diverse.”
Despite this progress, Field said that gender stereotypes still remain in the Law School’s hiring process.
“The more you present yourself as the old traditional type, the more likely you are to get in,” Field said.
Field said that “for [the faculty] to take you seriously, it’s nice to have a good male subject, what they think of as hard law subjects”—constitutional law­, for instance. She said female applicants fare better when presenting a “‘touchy-feely’ subject”—for example, family law or other “soft law” topics.
Others, including professor John F. Manning ’82, chair of the lateral hiring committee, contested Field’s characterization of the hiring process, saying that they do not see any correlation between the topic presented during the workshop and a candidate’s ability to be hired.
“Some of the most successful presentations I’ve had have been on subjects that have been regarded as sort of soft law,” said Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz, who said that his own subjects were typically regarded as softer. “I welcome more people in those subjects.”
The Law School has also taken steps to accommodate faculty members—both male and female—who want to balance both their personal life and their professional careers.
Law School professor David B. Wilkins ’77, who is an expert on gender issues in the legal profession, said that an important obstacle to women’s success is the simultaneous timing, in many cases, of pursuing a tenure-track position and choosing to raise a family.
To this end, Harvard Law School offers a parental leave program and allows faculty members to extend the period necessary to be considered for tenure, Minow said.
“I’m a woman, I’m a mother,” she said. “It’s a priority for me to allow people to have meaningful lives, work, and family.”
A GENDERED FEELING?
Before she came to Harvard in 2010, Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson taught and held associate deanships at Georgetown University Law Center. At Georgetown, she said, the more gender-balanced faculty created a remarkably different environment.
“It felt different just in terms of more women, more women at the workshops, and more women at the faculty,” she said, acknowledging that many other factors contributed to her perception.
For some professors like Jackson who have spent time at other law schools, Harvard’s gender disparity creates a distinct atmosphere around lunch tables and faculty workshops.
“For a variety of reasons, including the gender disparity, the faculty culture does have what I think scholars of this topic would describe as a masculine attitude, a way of presenting yourself and your arguments that has gender associations,” Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said, adding that “assertive, outright statements” take precedence in faculty conversations.
Field said that as a result, engaging in faculty discussions becomes much more difficult for professors who are less outgoing.
“The first thing you have to learn how to do here is how to interrupt,” she said. “I think you’re considered smarter if you are showing off.”
Others, including Law School professor Jeannie Suk, disagreed, saying that they think the faculty environment is very accepting of female professors.
“On the treatment of women, there is no doubt that the experience of my generation—who began their academic careers in a law school with a female dean in a university with a female president—is likely very different from that of prior generations of HLS faculty,” Suk said. “I imagine those experiences would inevitably shape the individual views and perceptions of the faculty today.”
Some professors said that the gender imbalance impacts not only the tenor of the discussion, but also the topics of conversation and research.
“When I go to conferences, I hear about lots of topics that are quite interesting that you wouldn’t hear about here,” Field said, citing reproductive law as an example. “There are some major law schools that have these kinds of dynamic discussions all the time.”
Other professors take issue with this characterization, saying that the Law School accepts many points of view and supports many kinds of legal research.
“There’s a reason that Elena Kagan called it the ‘New York City of Law Schools,’” said Manning, the chair of the lateral hiring committee. “We have an incredibly intellectually diverse faculty that deals with a wide variety of research.”
Suk, who said she had never felt pushback on any of her own research, which includes fashion and family law, said she did not think there were any research topics that could not be pursued.
“I believe that on gender-related topics, HLS at this moment has one of the most alive, diverse, innovative and fascinating academic scenes imaginable,” she wrote in an email. “The environment is not ‘supportive’ of particular positions but rather of true exploration and difference on these topics.”
Still, Law School professor Christine Desan said that the impact of the gender disparity has an undeniable impact on faculty interactions.
“The faculty is now about 80 percent male. That’s a very different conversation than if you had 50 percent women at the table,” she said. “Day after day, I’m sitting at a table that’s 75 percent male, and that’s a different experience than if I sat with 50 percent. That does have an impact on the school and the environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an interview with The Crimson last week, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith expressed regret over the handling of the search of Harvard resident deans’ email accounts.
Still, the administrators, who authorized the controversial searches, maintained that the searches were necessary to plug a breach in confidentiality.
Both Hammonds and Smith cracked a smile when asked whether things should have been done differently, saying that the answer was obvious. Proper policy was not in place at the time of the searches and communications mistakes were made, they said.
The hour-long interview was the Deans’ first sit-down with The Crimson since news of the covert searches broke on March 9, and the first with any media outlet since Hammonds announced to faculty at their monthly meeting on April 2 that she had broken FAS email privacy policy by authorizing a second round of searches of faculty, rather than administrative, accounts without Smith’s approval.
Since news of the searches became public, administrators have explained that they were intended to plug a leak of confidential Administrative Board documents related to the massive Government 1310 cheating investigation. Despite challenges to that claim by several College administrators who say that the email in question was neither confidential nor a leak, Smith and Hammonds reaffirmed that justification on Friday.
“All Administrative Board materials are confidential. That’s a statement of fact,” Hammonds said. Following this protocol, the forwarding of Ad Board emails is a breach of confidentiality.
Faculty email policy says that all searches of faculty accounts must be authorized by the FAS Dean and the University Office of the General Counsel. It also says that administrators must notify faculty members before or immediately after their accounts are searched.
Resident deans were not notified in this case.
Though Smith and Hammonds declined to comment on a number of specific decisions made at the time of the searches, they addressed several unanswered questions raised by the searches, clarifying procedure but leaving most policy justification unclear.
Smith and Hammonds affirmed that the University does view resident deans as members of the faculty, but maintained that they also have an additional administrative role and accompanying administrative email accounts not protected by the FAS policy.
“They show up to Faculty Council and sit on Faculty Council, so I can’t imagine you could categorize them any other way,” Smith said.
Smith also said that the Office of the General Counsel advised administrators on the legal implications of the case, as well as its compliance with Harvard policy. While he authorized the first round of searches with the OGC, he did not give approval for the second, meaning that in authorizing that search without Smith, Hammonds and the OGC violated FAS policy. Although Hammonds apologized to faculty for the breach, she declined to comment on why the General Counsel did not correct her erroneous March 11 statement which included no mention of the second round of searches.
The inconsistency in the deans’ statements has widened what many in the Harvard community have called a growing gap of trust between the Harvard community and administrators. Smith and Hammonds said Friday that they are receptive to faculty and student concerns and committed to improving communication.
“It’s entirely understandable that our community wants to know better how we’re thinking about it, where we’re going, what decisions are being made,” Smith said. “And, when the communication isn’t as robust as it needs to be, people start to worry.”
Part of improving communication, they said, means clarifying policies that are not sufficiently clear.
“We take email privacy very seriously for all of our community,” said Smith.
University President Drew G. Faust announced at the April 2 faculty meeting that she had commissioned an email privacy policy task force to review policies across the University and address ambiguity and inconsistencies that may exist. History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the vice-chair of the FAS Docket Committee, will lead a broader discussion about consultation and communication between faculty and administrators during the upcoming faculty meeting this Tuesday.
The deans did not comment publicly on whether or not administrators search student email accounts and what circumstances might warrant such searches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council Representatives marked their final general meeting of the year with discussions about the potential removal of pre-term planning and a vote on previously-discussed changes to UC election procedure.
According to UC Secretary Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16, Education Chair Darragh Nolan ’15 asked the Council for general reactions to the potential removal of pre-term planning. According to Kanuparthy, Nolan prefaced the question by adding that the Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith were considering a proposal to remove pre-term planning.
Kanuparthy said that the Council’s response to the proposal was mixed.
Dunster House representative Joshua B. Scott ’15 said in an interview after the meeting that he believed that when pre-term planning is “taken seriously” by the student body, it provides a substantial benefit to students and administrators.
“When you come here, you already have so much going on with move-in...but having some sort of a plan in action is wonderful in my book...when it’s done properly,” he said.
However, Scott said that he would welcome changes to strengthen pre-term planning’s structure, suggesting that the system could be changed to allow students to indicate the “degree of certainty” that they had about taking a certain class.
Scott also said that the fine levied on students for not completing the pre-term planning tool was a problem that needs to be fixed, especially because he believes students do not take pre-term planning very seriously.
Kanuparthy said in an interview after the meeting that he believes that students do take pre-term planning seriously.
“I had this conversation earlier, back when the results of pre-term planning came out,” said Kanuparthy. “It seems like it’s something that works and something I don’t think many people have a problem with.”
Although Kanuparthy said he supports pre-term planning, he said he would not be opposed to a new system to accomplish the same things the current system does.
“If the College thinks it has a better way of finding out what classes people are going to take and how to prepare for that then go right ahead,” he said. “One less thing for me to have to do, right?”
The Council also voted on Sunday to amend its constitution, adopting one of two proposals floated at last week’s meeting. The proposal provides a permanent fix for situations in which all three house representatives are committee chairs—for whom terms last until the end of the fall semester—leaving no open seats in the fall general election.
The proposal, now codified into the UC’s official rules, would ensure at least one representative election for each house or freshman yard. That fourth representative would serve his or her house for one year, with the number of representatives returning to three by the following fall election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A task force of 16 professors and deans pulled from nearly all of the University’s schools convened for the first time Monday to begin its task of reviewing existing University email privacy policies and recommending new ones.
The group, commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust amidst an ongoing email privacy scandal, includes a House Master, two directors of research centers, and minister of Memorial Church Jonathan R. Walton, according to a member list released to The Crimson on Monday.
During Monday’s introductory meeting, committee members got to know each other and went over their task at hand, a task force member wrote in an email.
The task force’s chair, Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89, said that the group aims to complete its work by the end of the upcoming fall semester and present its recommendations to Faust by January 2014.
Barron said that Faust invited the 16 members to serve on the committee. A primary consideration in choosing the task force’s members, Barron added, was including representatives from all different parts of the University and incorporating a variety of perspectives and expertises.
“We wanted people with a range of experiences, both administrative and scholarly,” said Barron, a former Crimson president, going on to say, “It’s a good, representative committee, with a lot of experience.”
According to its charge, the task force will also reach out to students, faculty, and staff in an attempt to understand the perspectives of those groups. Barron added that the committee had already reached out to Undergraduate Council representatives.
“[Faust has] made clear she would like [the recommendations] to be subject to community discussion,” Barron said.
The task force will consider whether there should be a University-wide email policy in order to eliminate existing policy inconsistencies across schools, the charge says, reiterating what Faust said in an April 2 faculty meeting.
The charge never explicitly acknowledges the scandal that prompted its creation, but does say it will take into account “instructive examples at Harvard and elsewhere.” Still, the charge says the committee is “not expected to investigate or render judgments on past events.”
Email privacy policy first came under scrutiny in early March, when news broke that Harvard administrators had authorized secret searches of resident deans’ accounts to identify what administrators have called a leak of confidential Administrative Board information related to the Government 1310 cheating case. Administrators wrote in a March 11 statement that the searches had been limited to the deans’ administrative, rather that faculty, accounts.
That distinction highlighted the inconsistencies and grey areas in the two FAS policies—one governing faculty accounts, and the other, staff accounts. The faculty policy says that accounts can only be searched if the account user is notified before or shortly after the query takes place. Staff policy does not require notification.
Concerns about those policies intensified on April 2 when Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds revealed to faculty at their monthly meeting that she had authorized a second round of secret searches, which included queries of a single resident dean’s faculty email account. Those searches explicitly broke FAS policy because Smith did not authorize them.
Faust first announced the creation of the task force at that April 2 meeting. Citing inconsistencies between policies across the University, Faust called the current situation “highly inadequate.”
Faust also tasked Boston attorney Michael B. Keating with investigating the searches’ handling and authoring an independent report that will eventually be shared with the Harvard community.
“My reaction to the lack of university policies in this realm is that it constitutes a significant institutional failure to provide adequate guidance and direction in a digital environment that is a powerful and rapidly changing force in all of our lives,” Faust told the faculty members gathered for the meeting. ”I believe we need clear, visible, and well articulated policies and processes.”
Barron also said that he and the other members of the task force understand the gravity of their charge, and that he thinks the group’s recommendations could serve as a model for universities and other institutions that face questions related to email privacy.
“Everybody understands the seriousness of the questions we’re dealing with,” Barron said. “[Email policies are] a real challenge for not just this University, but a lot of different institutions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Legislation inquiring into the legality of renting parking spaces in apartment garages was among the most contested issues discussed during Monday night’s City Council meeting, as Councillors related the matter to the larger issue of government regulation.
The order called on the City Solicitor to clarify whether the owners of parking spaces in apartments garages can rent those spaces out to car owners who are “unrelated to the property.”
According to Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, current zoning ordinances stipulate that apartment buildings allot a certain number of parking spaces per housing unit.
“Car ownership has gone down, and that’s the capacity that’s sitting there,” said vanBeuzenkom, adding that several residents had told her that they would rent out their unused parking spaces if not for uncertainty about the legality of such actions.
When the vanBeuzenkom introduced the legislation, many of her fellow Councillors initially reacted with confusion.
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. was concerned that the parking order proposed Monday would not ease but rather exacerbate the problems caused by the city’s current parking strictures.
“I think we’re over-regulating here,” said Toomey. “I think this could affect private driveways once we start moving in that direction.”
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 said he was surprised by the discussion at hand.
“Back in capitalist America, it seems to me that the owner of the spaces would have the right to rent them at all times,” said Reeves.
At the suggestion of Councillor Leland Cheung, the Council voted to send the legislation back to the Subcommittee on Transportation, Traffic and Parking.
Cheung pointed out that for an issue such as the one being discussed, “There’s a lot beneath the surface.” He noted that the number of questions and comments on the parking spaces order made sending it to the subcommittee for further exploration a necessary step.
The City Council also spent a significant portion of the Monday night meeting approving a series of the City Manager’s budget appropriations. The Council approved the transfer of funds from the Cambridge Housing Authority to non-profits providing services for the homeless. The Council also approved funding for the Cambridge Community Learning Center’s Bridge to College Program and for the replacement of a heavy-duty rescue truck.
