After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s Basketball beat writer David Freed notes three things to watch in the lead up to the fifth game of the season for the 1-3 Crimson, who take on Bryant at 7 p.m. Eastern.
1. Struggles At the Point — Harvard coach Tommy Amaker was frank after freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy turned in a zero-assist, five turnover game Sunday at Boston College, noting that “it is a process for a young player”. McCarthy has been the starter in each of the four games but has struggled offensively, with 15 turnovers against 11 assists and 33 field goal misses against just nine makes. Backup junior Corbin Miller has been steadier, if unspectacular, in limited action with just four turnovers in 85 minutes. The Crimson enter a soft spot in their schedule with three winnable games against Bryant, Holy Cross, and Northeastern before traveling to Kansas. If McCarthy continues to struggle against easier competition, Amaker may consider moving to his more experienced backup.
2. Usage v. Efficiency — One of the perplexing conundrums for the Crimson through four games has been the offensive play of junior forward Zena Edosomwan. The former top-100 recruit has been a monster on the glass—averaging four more rebounds than anyone on the team—but offensively has been an enigmas. On a team that shoots just under 59 percent from the line, Edosomwan is a primary culprit, making just half of his 26 attempts, shooting nearly as well from the field (49 percent) as he does from the line. Given that Harvard’s starting backcourt is shooting just 30 percent combined, the team has not lost a step offensively by force-feeding the junior in the post, but the situation is one to monitor going forward.
3. Taking Care of the Ball — Amaker, a former point guard himself, always focuses on his team taking care of the ball. After the team turned it over 24 times against Holy Cross a year ago, he notes that “it is hard to think that you are going to be able to win, let alone have a chance to win, with that many turnovers”. In the past he has praised Siyani Chambers ’15-’16 for his steadiness at the point, keeping the team’s offense on track and under control. Without Chambers, the team’s assist-to-turnover ratio has slipped from 1.1 to 0.8. Freshman Corey Johnson is the only starter averaging more assists than turnovers. Look for it to be a focus of improvement moving forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s safe to say receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley had a decent season for a freshman. The unanimous Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Shelton-Mosley was also named to the All-Ivy First Team as a return specialist and ended the season with four straight Ivy League Rookie of the Week performances.
Last weekend, Shelton-Mosley participated in his first playing of The Game. Following the program’s first loss in over two years to Penn the week before, the Harvard football team struggled early. After scoring on the first drive, the Crimson were forced to punt in each of their next three drives. Similar to last season, the game, tied at 7-7, seemed evenly matched through 15 minutes of play.
Harvard found itself down early in the first quarter when Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts found receiver Christopher Williams-Lopez on a 4th-and-12 for a 28-yard touchdown on the Bulldogs’ first possession. Then the Crimson offense, spurred by Shelton-Mosley, got its shot.
“We had a third and long,” senior quarterback Scott Hosch said. “Justice ran a great route, so much speed and athleticism over there, and he got behind the defense. I was able to put the ball out there. He was able to score, and we were able to bounce back.”
After playing in some tight contests over the last few weeks, the Crimson looked to get some distance from the Bulldogs, and that separation came in the form of Shelton-Mosley. While his first score showed his speed, his second score of the day demonstrated his video-game like agility.
Early in the second quarter, with the squad driving at the Yale 35 yard-line, Shelton-Mosley caught a bullet from Hosch over the middle. The 5’10” receiver quickly juked out his defender, who proceeded to fall on the ground, and walked in for his second score of the day.
In addition to his two reception touchdowns, Shelton-Mosley also scored the first rushing touchdown of his career by way of an eight yard carry in the fourth quarter. The freshman finished the day with 119 yards receiving on five catches, eight yards rushing, and 26 return yards to total 153 all-purpose yards.
However, it isn’t just his ability to score that garners praise for Shelton-Mosley from teammates and coaches alike. The receiver has routinely been able to get yards out of what seems like a busted play, using his breakneck speed and deft turns to elude tackles.
“It’s unbelievable,” Hosch said. “One play comes to mind...I just throw him a simple slant route in the flat to the left, we kind of get stopped...and he just catches that thing and turns down and gets like 40 yards.”
In his first game against Harvard’s oldest rival, Shelton-Mosley led the team in receiving yards and touchdowns, proving to be an integral part in the Crimson’s 38-19 victory over Yale.
“It’s definitely a blessing,” Shelton-Mosley said. “It was amazing to be out there and see all the alumni, and it just kind of showed me what kind of tradition that I’ve just got into, what I’m part of now. It’s going to be amazing to see [Hosch] come back next year [as an alum]. It’s just a blessing to be part of such a great tradition, and to be able to go out there and play well.”
The receiver ended the season with 589 receiving yards, second only behind senior tight-end Ben Braunecker. He led the team in both all-purpose and return yards with 1140 and 331, respectively. Moreover, he was the only freshman with more than 50 receiving yards throughout the season, and the only freshman back who played in all 10 contests.
Shelton-Mosley’s 19.0 yards per punt return were the most for any Harvard player in the program’s history and led the next highest Ivy League player by more than seven yards per return—and he has another three years to develop as a collegiate player.
“He’s a great player,” Yale coach Tony Reno said. “When he gets the ball in his hands, he’s electric with it. He’s one of those guys who accelerates really well, and he changes directions really well. For a guy his size, he’s really difficult to tackle. Very good football player.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In front of a mostly empty Lavietes Pavilion on the first day of Thanksgiving break, the Harvard men’s basketball team ended its three-game slide, riding a career-high 16 points and eight assists from freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy to an 80-45 win over fellow New England opponent Bryant.
“I was very pleased with the team victory that was much needed for our program,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought our kids really responded and prepared and played with a great deal of energy with discipline.”
After a free throw from Bryant’s Marcel Pettway narrowed Harvard’s lead to eight with just under ten minutes left in the first, two dunks from junior forward Zena Edosomwan sparked a 14-0 run that extended the Crimson’s cushion to 22 points with just two and a half minutes to play in the first half. The Crimson (2-3) defense held the Bulldogs (2-3) without a field goal for a nine-minute span in the first frame.
The Crimson hit the floor running the set the tone early. McCarthy found senior forward Agunwa Okolie alone under the basket six seconds after the opening tip-off to open the scoring for Harvard. A three from McCarthy and a putback from captain Evan Cummins on the next two possessions stretched the early lead to seven.
“Tonight was a night when you really felt it elevate—the confidence level,” Amaker said. “That’s going to be a big a piece of the puzzle as any.”
After having struggled shooting in its first few games—especially against UMass, where the team shot less than 36 percent—the team started the game off on a shooting tear, going 11-for-16 from the field and 4-for-6 from downtown to build a 27-16 lead halfway through the first period. It headed into the locker room up 41-23, making ___ percent of its first half shots.
“We need a lot out of [our shooters],” Cummins said. “It’s really important that their confidence stays high. If they miss one, get the next one.”
A deep three from freshman Corey Johnson and dunks from Cummins and Edosomwan to open the second pushed the lead to 25 points and all but ended any chance of a Bulldog comeback.
“We did something we haven’t done all season and that was come out in the second half and … not allow a team to go on a 6-0 run, 8-0 run,” Amaker said. “We actually did that and they had to call a quick timeout.”
While three Bulldogs—Pettway, Hunter Ware, and Bosko Kostur—got to double figures on the night, the rest of the team had major trouble finding the basket, putting up nine points combined through the first 36 minutes.
Harvard’s speed and size was a significant factor in the team jumping out to a huge first-half lead. The Crimson asserted its advantage early in the contest, recording five blocks and forcing 11 turnovers in the first half. The Bulldogs had trouble stopping the Crimson forwards in the paint, as Harvard pounded Bryant down low for 28 points in the paint.
“We always like to play inside-out,” Cummins said. “The way matchups worked out tonight, that certainly worked well for us.”
None of those points came off of Edosomwan free throws, however. The junior put up 14 points in the winning effort, but missed all three of his attempts from the charity stripe. The California native is 16-for-35 from the line on the year.
Even in the win, the team did not solve its turnover problem. After giving the ball away 22 and 16 times against Providence and UMass, respectively, the Crimson coughed up the ball 14 times. However, the defense was able to limit the damage, giving up only six points off the giveaways.
After seeing only two minutes of playing time so far this year, senior Patrick Steeves saw significant action tonight for the Crimson, putting up eight points, three rebounds, and two blocks, the first of which sent the Harvard bench to its feet.
“We’ve been waiting for it to all come together,” Cummins said. “Every game it seems like…. there’s something different that we’re disappointed with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing its first three games against Division I competition, the Harvard men’s basketball team (2-3) ended its longest losing streak since 2009 with a 35-point rout of the visiting Bryant Bulldogs (2-3). Freshman Tommy McCarthy set career highs with 16 points and eight assists and the Crimson shot nearly 55 percent from the floor in the 80-45 victory.
FINDING HIS STROKE
Coming into the game, McCarthy’s struggles were an easy emblem for the team’s early-season woes. The freshman turned the ball over 15 times against just 11 assists through four games while shooting 22 percent on nearly nine shots a game.
Early on, it was clear the freshman was determined to rewrite the script.
Six seconds into the game, McCarthy found senior forward Agunwa Okolie inside for a game-opening layup. After a missed layup by Bryant on the other end, the freshman made a three-pointer with a hand in his face as the shot clock ran down. The Crimson ended up scoring on its first seven possessions of the game, with McCarthy contributing via pass or a bucket on five.
“I thought the efficiency was really there for our team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We talked about each individual remembering their roles and doing their jobs and how the sum of that was going to add to something we were going to feel good about.”
Despite shooting poorly throughout, Bryant stayed within striking distance for the first 12 minutes due to four Crimson turnovers, one by McCarthy. Coming out of the under-eight time out, however, the Harvard essentially put the game away behind the efforts of its point guard. During the 12-0 run that pushed the lead to 22, McCarthy had five points and one assist, including another trey as the shot clock ran down.
“I think that Tommy did a magnificent job … of having us in position to execute in late-clock situations,” Amaker said. “If you can execute and score late-clock, that’s a hard thing for a defense to overcome.”
McCarthy also flashed an improved on-court connection with junior center Zena Edosomwan. After assisting on just two Edosomwan field goals through four games, the freshman found the upperclassman six times on Wednesday night. The junior ended the night with seven makes on nine attempts, tallying an efficient 14 points and five rebounds.
SENIOR STALWART
While the highlight of the game was the Crimson’s offensive explosion, Harvard quietly held its fifth straight opponent under 40 percent shooting from the field. Bryant connected on just three of its 20 three-point attempts and its starters went a collective 0-for-12 from behind the three-point line.
While Edosomwan led the team with three blocks, Amaker singled out the defensive effort of Okolie after the game.
Okolie, who is tasked in every game with guarding the opponent’s best perimeter player, led the team with nine rebounds while holding Bulldog guard Spencer Ware to just 10 points on 5-of-12 shooting. Ware, who came into the game averaging 18.5 points a contest, matched a season low in points and set a career high with five turnovers.
Ware’s struggles are nothing new for Okolie’s mark. Nearly without fail, the best wing player opposing the Crimson has struggled this year. While Providence’s Kris Dunn had 32 points in Harvard’s second game, each of the other player Okolie has shadowed—UMass’ Trey Davis, MIT’s Justin Pedley, Boston College’s Eli Carter, and Ware—have averaged 9.8 points on 30 percent shooting against the senior wingman.
In their other games, the foursome has averaged 15.4 points on 47 percent shooting. All four set season lows in point scored when facing Okolie.
“His presence on the court is critical,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “… I am very pleased and proud of his effort throughout the whole season and how he has played for us.”
