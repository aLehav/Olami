After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Kanye West dropped his debut album on Feb. 10, 2004, he forever changed the rap game. “The College Dropout” was a critical and commercial success, but it was a surprise to most of Kanye fans at the time. The Kanye of the mid-90s and early 2000s was well known not as a rapper, but as a producer, the genius behind the beats in Jay-Z’s “The Blueprint” and other popular hits by singers like Alicia Keys and Ludacris. The industry wanted him for his beats, not his lines, and it took him several years and many failed attempts before he finally got Damon Dash to reluctantly sign him to Roc-A-Fella Records.
"The College Dropout” brought something different to the hip-hop scene. For as long as there was hip-hop and rap, there were songs that addressed societal issues, racism, and the African-American experience. But overall, in the early 2000s, rap was still a genre dominated by trap. While Kanye clearly respected the hustle, he avoided themes of violence that were more popular with his peers. What makes “The College Dropout” stand out then and now is Kanye’s beautiful execution of witty rhymes and stunning production. Throw in a few excellent guest features, and you have a masterpiece.
The album starts off with “We Don’t Care,” a joyful beat juxtaposed by lyrics about the unpleasant necessity of dealing drugs, topped off by a children’s chorus singing verses like “Drug dealing just to get by / Stack your money ‘til it gets sky high.” Then we get to songs like “All Falls Down,” where Kanye struggles with his desire for value and validation through expensive name brand clothing and accessories — a very noticeable difference from the Kanye today. “Spaceship” follows, a steady, soulful song in which Kanye and two guest rappers, GLC and Consequence, sing about desiring a more fulfilling life where they get the fame and recognition they deserve.
Beyond even these gems, there are truly extraordinary tracks that hold up the album to this day. “Jesus Walks” is one of them. The gospel-fueled, intense track is an ode to Christianity and finding redemption in times of intense moral struggle. The song emphasizes Kanye’s faith in God, and one particular line in the chorus embodies the theme of the song: Poignant, poised, and powerful, Kanye pleads, “God show me the way because the Devil is tryna break me down.” It’s a strong line that not only demonstrates Kanye’s struggle for faith, but his fearlessness too — not everyone can admit to feeling vulnerable and wanting guidance. “Slow Jamz,” in contrast, is a saucy and melodic song about a suggestive encounter between a man and a woman. The song utilizes a slow beat and couples it with Jamie Foxx’s lyrical chorus and Twista’s quick lines in the second verse to create a warm, soft-beat track that pays tribute to classic soul artists.
It would be foolish to remember “The College Dropout” without talking about “Through the Wire,” the first single, and arguably the heart of the album. A couple of years before the release of the album, Kanye got in a near-fatal car accident and had to have reconstructive jaw surgery. Two weeks after the surgery, with his jaw still recovering, Kanye recorded the first version of “Through the Wire,” the lyrics slurring as he recounted his tale of horror while throwing some comedic elements into the mix. The chorus is a high-pitched sample of Chaka Khan’s “Through the Fire,” uplifting and steady despite some of the grounding lyrics in which Kanye talks about how “half [his] jaw was in the back of [his] mouth” and how “in a blink of an eye, his whole life changed.” It is a powerful song about determination and perseverance; Kanye avoided death, and his physical state wasn’t going to stop him from rapping and doing what he loved.
It is hard to dissect “The College Dropout” and its legacy track by track. From the nostalgic “Family Business,” to the high-stakes, crescendo-building “Two Words,” to “School Spirit,” a critical piece about higher education, Kanye raps about anything and everything. Though many of Kanye’s fans today were just toddlers when he released ‘The College Dropout”, it evokes a strange sense of nostalgia. The Kanye of “The College Dropout” was fresh, still a struggling artist eager to prove his worth and fighting against societal norms for what he believed was right.
The Kanye of today seems to have become a part of the very system he criticized, someone who rides trends (ex. “I Love It” with Lil Pump), covers himself in expensive clothing, and contributes to consumerism — the very thing he spoke against in “All Falls Down.” He aligns himself with a racist President, despite frequently discussing the social and economic challenges faced by African-Americans in his music. Kanye West appears to be a changed person from who he once was, even if he still releases some pretty decent songs. If anything, now is the perfect time to listen to who Kanye was — if only to remember the humble beginnings and industry-shattering talent that skyrocketed him to the fame that shaped who he became.

Improbable meet-cutes, pointless flash mobs, and spontaneous, somehow perfectly choreographed karaoke scenes are some of the enshrined elements of romantic comedies that have long deserved an affectionate parody. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson invites skeptics of pyrotechnical romance into the perspective of Natalie (Rebel Wilson), who is an uncompromising cynic when it comes to sappy love stories, as becomes clear when she launches into a tirade against romantic comedies: “All those movies are lies set to terrible pop songs.” Of the adorably clumsy female protagonist (think Bridget in “Bridget Jones’s Diary”), Natalie says, “In real life, people would think you have muscular dystrophy.” One day, Natalie suffers a concussion and awakes to find that she is living the charmed life of a romantic comedy heroine. She puzzles at her new, beautified surroundings, saying, “This isn’t an emergency room. This is a Williams Sonoma.”
It seems that in setting out to upend tropes, Strauss-Schulson has minted his own ironic brand of rom-com (after all, as much as Natalie despises them, her story sure resembles one), one based on a careful calculus, rather than fairy-dust alchemy. After watching 80 romantic comedies as part of his research, he became attuned to the slightest of visual rom-com tropes. Even the half-moon windows in Natalie’s pristine Tiffany box of an apartment harken back to romantic symbolism, as arches in tarots are fittingly associated with new beginnings. As if casting a comedy skit, Strauss-Schulson reprises clichés (the unwitting curmudgeon who finds love, the best friend whose only apparent hobby is meddling in the protagonist’s personal life) in mocking others, as his main characters tend to be two-dimensional (perhaps self-consciously so — such ambiguity might attest to his genius rather than his negligence). However, he manages to thumb his nose at so many hokey rituals, logistical flaws, and unaccountable details of romantic comedies through consistently hilarious, snappy dialogue that his thoroughness and economy make up for what his characters lack in complexity.
Strauss-Schulson inventively sheds light on the manipulative optics of romance on the big screen, on the cosmically auspicious worlds in which lovelorn (but not for long!) female protagonists reside, where sunlight is brighter and where there is no traffic. In a sobering moment, Natalie marvels at how differently people treat her in her fantastical new world, “Guys look at me in the eyes.” Blake (Liam Hemsworth), Natalie’s love interest, partakes in peacock-like showmanship — for their first date, he whisks her off to a private dinner on a yacht and they kiss in the middle of a suspiciously deserted New York street. But besides Natalie, whom Wilson bestows with a perfectly wry deadpan, the characters who exist to set her love life in motion, like Whitney (Betty Gilpin), Natalie’s sentimental and supportive secretary, aren’t developed beyond choice comedic moments that make for convenient zingers and that affirm their own clichéd roles. At times, Strauss-Schulson seems to adopt the tropes he would otherwise parody, had he not decided to create his own romantic comedy that is confined by the strictures of the genre. Blake, a vapid cardboard cutout of a hot man who woos Natalie with his flinty gazes and limited vocabulary, serves as the perfect foil for Josh (Adam Devine), the nice guy who almost finishes last (think Matt in “13 Going on 30”). The unsavory aspects of Blake’s personality only grate on her when it’s the time for her to act on her newly-realized love for Josh, who has become entranced by Isabella (Priyanka Chopra), a swimsuit model and yoga ambassador — although it’s always patently clear that even in this dreamscape, Natalie isn’t fooled by Blake’s acrobatics.
It’s difficult to keep up with all the delightful nuances of romantic gamesmanship Strauss-Schulson parodies, especially when they’re subtle. In Natalie’s life of drudgery, her promising work is overlooked and Blake, a client at her architectural firm, hands her an unsolicited coffee order. In Natalie’s new romantic dreamscape, Strauss-Schulson ups Blake’s mystique by giving him an Australian accent. When Blake approaches her, he writes his phone number on flower petals and drops them into her hat, which pairs with an Amal Clooney-esque outfit — because of course, every rom-com heroine must own an exquisite wardrobe she can’t afford. Natalie’s matted dog is perfectly groomed, Instagrammable, and obedient, for once. Her tetchy neighbor Donny (Brandon Scott Jones) has been reborn as her gay best friend, the kind that exists to dote on the rom-com heroine’s every concern. He sing-songs, “I’m going to drop you off at the office on my way to no plans whatsoever.” A makeover montage song comes on in her closet before she stops it in its tracks. When Blake gets into bed with her, Natalie can’t actually enjoy the night with him, as per most PG-13 romantic comedies, which cut to the next day. She quickly realizes why she wouldn’t want her life to be a movie, despite the fact that everything in her new world is palatable, down to the peripheral characters. Before she can throw herself in front of a train to awake from this special hell, Natalie is saved by a hunky Officer Hansom.
Initially, Natalie is convinced that she only needs someone to fall in love with her in order to awake from her living nightmare. But “Isn’t It Romantic” is particularly refreshing because Natalie doesn’t wait for the worm to turn, for some fantastical intervention that will set her life aright. She must see herself differently, just as Amy Schumer’s character in “I Feel Pretty,” a critically panned but enjoyable film, does when she recognizes the transformative power of self-love. It’s comforting to see Strauss-Schulson acknowledge the enduring charm of the rom-com as a genre, despite his jesting. He comes full circle with a schmaltzy but heartwarming notion of his own: Magic is in discovering something that is already there, underneath a prosaic reality. Best friends realizing inopportunely that they’re in love with each other isn’t necessarily the most original premise (think “Friends with Benefits” and “My Best Friend’s Wedding”). As Natalie plows through a meet-cute in progress in Washington Square Park, Josh tells her, “You’re blind to love. You don’t even see it.” To a trained eye, love is all around.

It seems like a safe assumption that everyone knows and loves Diana Ross, and if anyone doesn’t, they should. Among her classic Motown recordings with The Supremes, her epic, cinematic music as a solo artist, and her acting work in films like “Lady Sings the Blues” and “The Wiz,” her career offers something for everyone. It’s her early singing that stands out — one could listen endlessly to her heartbreakingly restrained delivery of the lines “Haven’t I been good to you? Haven’t I been sweet to you?” on The Supremes’ “Stop! In The Name of Love.”
But that’s not what this article is about. It’s about Ross’s appearance at the Grammys two weeks ago, when she sang two songs and, notably, concluded by shouting “Happy birthday to me!” Her birthday is in a month.
Granted, Ross’s performance was billed as a 75th birthday celebration, and granted, this was the one strange moment in an otherwise by-the-book several minutes. What was striking about “Happy birthday to me!” besides its hilarious absurdity was how unlike Diana Ross it seemed.
Ross’s image has always been one of class and dignity. Perhaps more than any other singer, she realized Motown’s 1960s dreams of making white audiences love black music, and many music critics and cultural historians see her controlled singing, well-rehearsed choreography, glamorous dresses, and lack of public self-aggrandizement as directly correlated with her success. Ross didn’t just play the respectability game by our current standards; compare her '60s performances (aurally and visually) with Aretha Franklin’s much less inhibited ones, and you’ll see that Ross stood out even among Black entertainers in her time.
So to see her shout “Happy birthday to me!” on live national television was particularly jarring, like watching Jeff Sessions smoke a joint. Why did she do it? Maybe her politics have changed with the times, and she’s following loudly self-loving singers of this decade. Maybe her elegant red dress was a herring of the same color, and she doesn’t want to be respectable anymore. Her exclamation at the Grammys provides ample food for thought: As she first sang decades ago, “think it o-o-ver.”

Within the first few minutes of “The Breaker-Upperers,” protagonists Jen (Jackie van Beek) and Mel (Madeleine Sami) want you to know that they don’t just break up couples when something has gone awry — as Jen puts it, they’re “simply guiding two souls towards inevitability.” It’s easy enough, before watching, to assume that there might be some deeper insight into why people have such difficulty ending some of their closest relationships. However, this film stops at the surface level: tired tropes, jokes pandering to sexual, gender, and racial stereotypes, and a simple plot structure that makes some details easily forgettable. Of course, by the end, the viewer is left with the sense that this is all the film was meant to be — a lighthearted comedy about female friendship and how it can endure when the world throws men, sex, family, and biological clocks into the mix.
The premise is simple: Jen and Mel run a business specializing in getting people out of relationships, essentially functioning like a reverse Tinder. Their business of splitting couples apart, however, becomes complicated by Mel’s sudden relationship with a 17 year-old, the arrival of Jen’s cheating ex-boyfriend Joe (Cohen Holloway), who, true to rom-com form, is the sexy bad boy she never got over. Add in Jordan (James Rolleston), a young rugby player who wants to break up with his overwhelming and demanding girlfriend Sepa (Ana Scotney), and Mel’s new friendship with the ex-wife of a man who hired the two women, and things inevitably get complicated.
The New Zealand humor, much like British humor, makes it deceptively simple to coast past the movie’s over-reliance on stereotypes that are too dated to be funny. Case in point: Jen, tired of being single, starts to wonder if her family’s questioning about her sexuality may actually be rooted in fact. Mel promptly asks her if she knows who Kristen Stewart is and kisses her to test the family’s suspicions. Like anyone could have guessed, the kiss does not help Jen come to the miraculous conclusion that she is attracted to Mel, or to any other women.
Such moments occur repeatedly throughout the film, and take away from the better, deadpan moments that could have otherwise made the film succeed at what it really is: a rom-com written and directed by two women, Madeleine Sami and Jackie van Beek, who play Mel and Jen, respectively. The directors handle the relationship between a much-younger man and a much-older woman with sensitivity and realism — Mel and Jordan eventually break up, but there’s no squeamishness about the two of them getting together in the first place. Refreshingly, in the comparison to most Hollywood films, there’s even a scene in which Jordan performs oral sex on Mel, a sexual experience rarely portrayed in today’s cinema. Furthermore, two main characters of indigenous origins, Jordan and Sepa, are some of the largest, if not the largest, plot drivers of the entire film, taking center stage without reducing their complexities or backgrounds.
All these diverse bits in conjunction thus make the directors’ reliance on questionable stereotypes a little baffling: Did the directors think that pushing the boundaries of what is accepted in films meant they had to comfort their audience through the inclusion of other overused stereotypes? Did they feel that departing too much from preconceived notions of LGBTQ individuals and people of color would alienate Netflix watchers? Even by the time the ending credits roll around, the answer is still a bit unclear, which is a pity, because “The Breaker Upperers” is certainly designed to be a feel-good film, and it largely succeeds. It leans heavily on the complex friendship between the two women as they navigate the pitfalls of overcoming societal expectations of women in their 30s, the comedic effect of Jen’s family doing cocaine together as a bonding experience, and the portrayal of more than one sexual encounter not typically seen in many films.
The film’s big selling point is, however, its particular brand of humor: It’s not “The Office” funny, but the self-deprecation is all part of the fun. There are moments when the dryness and the deadpan stretches a joke further than it could otherwise go. Are some of them a little cringe-inducing? Yes. Are the other aspects of the film redeeming enough to render them less questionable? Perhaps not, but whatever Sami and van Beek set out to do, they’ve succeeded — for the most part.

Last Friday, rising indie artist Donna Missal performed at the Sinclair in her headline tour, following the release of her first album, “This Time,” in September. On her website, Missal said of the tour, “I was homeschooled. I never had a school dance or a picture day or a graduation. THIS TIME TOUR is your invitation to the winter and spring formal I never had.” She was accompanied by New York singer-songwriter Samia, who will next be joining Hippo Campus on their Bambi tour in April. Though both still lesser-known artists, each addressed a growing number of enthusiastic fans, filling the room with haunting vocals and a powerful stage presence that left the audience in awe.
Samia opened with confident, humble energy. She walked out onto to the stage in black jeans and a cropped long-sleeve tee, introduced herself and her guitarist to the crowd — quipping about the phlegm in her throat — and then proceeded to sing. Haunting vocals in songs like “Welcome to Eden” and the upbeat, vengeful energy of “Someone Tell the Boys” transfixed the crowd. She introduced her recent song “Lasting Friend” by saying, “This one is about how in middle school all the boys used to line up in the gym and touch my boobs at lunch,” her voice simultaneously joking and gravely serious. What followed was a powerful exploration of the complicated nature of shame over time, featuring an extended electric guitar solo. Samia’s song “Milk,” with calming lyrics that allude to coping with the death of a loved one, evoked a tangible sense of peace within heartbreak. She ended with a cover of The Knack’s 1979 single “My Sharona,” for which the tone of the performance became lighter, even celebratory, as she danced around the stage with the mic, lay on her back, and kicked her feet to the rhythm of the song. Before walking offstage, she repeated her former introduction, “I’m Samia. This is Sarah,” to affectionate laughter.
Missal opened her set with “Don’t Say Goodnight,” the last song off “This Time.” She let the ambient intro build suspense before coming onstage to the cheering of the crowd. Like Samia, Missal dressed simply, in a white tank top that left a sleeve of tattoos glowing beneath the colored stage lights. Her energy was contagious. She danced in smooth, rolling motions, punctuated with punches to the air in time with the music, often reaching her arms up and out to the crowd as if to connect with distant audience members.
When she paused her set to say a few words, the performance took on an empowering tone. “Women have been oppressed for a really long time,” she said. “Women are being represented now, and they look like us and they feel like us and that’s really important. So for all the women that are here tonight supporting other women, thank you so much.” Then, smiling into the audience, she quoted a line from her song “Girl,” and the crowd chanted it along with her: “When women hate on other women, everybody loses.”
The support Missal’s fans offered her went both ways. Everything about her stage presence lent itself in service to connecting with her audience, and the lyrics of her songs seemed written just as much for her listeners as for herself. Throughout the show, she continued to drop words of wisdom. At another pause in her set, she said, “I don’t think I heard this enough as a woman in the music industry, but your age does not define your value and your youth does not make you more valuable.” Staring out into her audience, Missal reassured every woman in the room that they have all the time in the world to reach where they want to be in their lives.

Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Matt Damon typically top the list when discussing successful dropouts of Harvard University, but a newer, younger artist is out to topple their reign. 18-year old musician Lil Pump, who jokes about having “drop[ped] out of Harvard to save the rap game,” released his long-awaited sophomore album “Harverd Dropout” last week. The opener, aptly named “Drop Out,” sets the tone for the next 15 tracks with synths and lyrics that “gas up” his unattainable riches.
The main appeal of Lil Pump’s musical style is the ease with which a listener can follow along. Tracks like “Vroom Vroom Vroom” intrigue with their repetition. The title emulates the song — the word “vroom” is repeated sixty times in the span of two minutes. “Racks on Racks,” also carries this essence and is heightened by the addition of his classic tagline “esskeetit” yelled throughout the chorus. Lil Pump keeping it simple is redeeming — his music is made for effortless enjoyment. “Harverd Dropout” doesn’t attempt to mask what it is: an indulgent mumble-rap album.
Most of the songs feature the same elements: a short synth melody that repeats the entire track, a simple beat, and Lil Pump’s shouting voice. While this formula succeeds in producing the bouncing melody of songs like “Off White,” the tracks “Too Much Ice” and “Multi Millionaire” fail to resonate. “Multi Millionaire” utilizes a tune of three seemingly random notes repeated for nearly three minutes, distracting more than they entertain. Save for some weak mixing, Lil Pump’s standard song structure succeeds more often than it doesn’t.
Where “Harverd Dropout” unequivocally disappoints, however, is in lack of variety. The tracks blend into each other rather seamlessly, but these easy transitions means that there is room for more diversity in sound and in lyrics. Each song stands as a vibrant single on its own, but together the repetition becomes rather tedious. Lil Pump himself seems to have recognized this trait — he dropped an unusual number of songs from the album prior to its official release, conceivably to distract from their incompatibility as a full entity. Listeners may only get the experience of hearing ten new tracks versus the actual 16, but had all 16 dropped at once, the overall monotony might have overpowered the more exciting components of the album.
However, a few tracks manage to break from this musical uniformity and provide depth to “Harverd Dropout.” The Kanye West collaboration “I Love It” is noticeably smoother than the rest. The aggressive character of the album is absent, providing variety from the wealth of more assertive pieces. And while “I Love It” has a more subdued vibe, it still maintains a catchy and dynamic beat. “Be Like Me” stands out because of the cadence that Lil Pump employs. Other tracks tend to lack intonation and real expression, but in this piece Lil Pump takes on a more meaningful character in his voice, especially when he says, “I’m a millionaire, but I don’t know how to read.”
The running motif throughout “Harverd Dropout” is Lil Pump’s ridiculous wealth and success despite his lack of education. In “Drug Addicts,” he raps, “Man, fuck school,” but the main purpose of mumble-rap artists like Lil Pump is not to write lyrics that inspire empathy, nor to thoughtfully construct musical masterpieces. Whether through hard work and effort, social media and meme savvy, or a little bit of both, Lil Pump has made a name for himself as a rapper and personality. The strength of Lil Pump is not so much his musical talent, but rather his ability to energize an audience. An album like “Harverd Dropout” is ultimately intended to produce something that entertains and that sells, and it succeeds in doing just that.

James Blake, best known in the U.S. for his 2013 single “Retrograde,” held a concert at the House of Blues Boston on Feb. 20. The spectacular performance highlighted his wide array of talents, from his soulful singing to electric R&B beats. Throughout the night, Blake managed to transform the atmosphere of the concert hall from quiet and anticipatory to pulsing with the aura of a techno club.
Blake started 2019 with his new album “Assume Form” and the hit single “Mile High” featuring Travis Scott and Metro Boomin. The concert in Boston was part of his North American tour planned for January and February. The tour featured songs from his latest album as well as new arrangements of a few of his classics.
Before Blake took the stage, however, the U.K.’s emerging star and Blake’s opener Khushi started off the night with some soft R&B and electronic beats to prepare the crowd for the show that was to come. Khushi’s set featured “Freedom Fall,” the track that marked the producer and songwriter’s return to the industry after a lengthy break.
Blake started off the night with his album’s namesake, “Assume Form,” letting his rich, soulful voice fill the concert hall and melt any lingering anticipation. Gleaming green hues and flashing strobe lights intersected with the vapor of the fog machine, spreading across the stage such that Blake sublimely emerged from the smoke. The mystifying atmosphere was complemented by Blake’s still figure as he sat at his keyboard and let his voice ring through the crowd. Engrossed in his music, he sang with such a passion that the audience could feel the wave of fervent emotions stemming from his lyrics.
This mystical feeling is emblematic for the artist, who began his music career producing DIY records in London in 2009. 10 years later, Blake’s sound is a staple in the music industry. He solidified his career with a 2014 Grammy nomination for Best New Artist and high-profile collaborations with Chance The Rapper, Beyoncé, and Drake, among others. His participation as co-writer and performer in Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, and Future’s hit single “King’s Dead” from the “Black Panther” soundtrack in January 2018 nabbed the artist a Top 40 in US charts.
The night continued with Blake switching between old and new songs, starting with “Life Round Here” and his 2016 hit, “Timeless.” The entire venue stayed incredibly lively and attentive and as Blake alternated his electronic beat with soulful vocals. The musician himself occasionally got up and spoke directly to the crowd. Noteworthy was Blake’s performance of “Mile High,” during which he flexed his experimental skills on the DJ set to put a live twist on the hit song.
The mood of the night began to shift with Blake’s extended outro of the song “Voyeur,” which diffused nightclub vibes into the room. The ominous green hue that engrossed the stage was paired with vibrant disco lights and invited the whole floor to start dancing to the electric groove that filed the air. This upbeat energy reached the next level as Blake played his all time favorite, “Retrograde,” and ended the show with his beloved song “Modern Soul.”
Still, the night wasn’t over yet. The crowd’s chants of “Encore!” brought Blake back out on the stage to perform two more awe-inspiring songs: “Don’t Miss It” and “Lullaby For My Insomniac.” Blake concluded the show on a mellow and feel-good note, leaving the room kindled in the fading light of the best Blake had to offer.

Boston may not be nationally recognized for its local rap scene, but that’s certainly not for lack of talent. Local rappers, as WBUR reports, have been largely shut out of performing at venues around the city, due to bias against the genre, performers, and fans. There are so many Boston rappers who are well-worth listening to — here’s a small sample of five great, relatively recent music videos from the local scene.
5. “Credit” by Dutch ReBelle
Dutch ReBelle stuns in this music video from her most recent album “Bang Bang” with her cool confidence, clever wordplay, and creative jokes (“Come shoot your shot and get hit with this boulder”), delivered over a beat constructed out of a glittering music box-like sample. The video is imaginatively set in an art gallery with different scenes portrayed as different moving paintings, which helps the visuals naturally segue. Dutch Rebelle has charm to spare — somehow she even makes a Red Sox cap look fashionable — and this release is a compelling demonstration of her prowess and presence.
4. “Cheekbones” by Hopeadope
In “Cheekbones,” a choice cut from Hopeadope’s recently released debut EP “Cute AF,” the rapper impresses with her flexible, imaginative flow and charming sexual candor and humor (“Make her legs go up and down / Then take her ass to brunch”) over a hypnotic house beat. The video, which features Hopeadope campily vamping in technicolor leotards, is equally creative and colorful. Hailing from Detroit, the now Boston-based rapper is bringing exciting new energy to the local scene.
3. “Rocky Barboa” by Billy Dean Thomas
Over a beat that sonically drops the listener into the middle of the boxing ring, Billy Dean Thomas (the self-proclaimed “Queer B.I.G.” ) lands blows (“White folks sleeping on me cause I’m brown / Why they pay less venue don’t reply”) with a fleet-footed flow. The video plays like a victory dance, alternating between shots of Thomas flexing in a slick self-branded boxing robe and sweatshirt and another dancer, who moves with kinetic abandon and a similar sense of hard-fought joy. This title track from Thomas’s debut EP strongly demonstrates their acumen and dexterity lyrically, sonically, and visually.
2. “Hennything’s Possible” by Vintage Lee
In Vintage Lee’s excellent single “Hennything’s Possible” from her 2017 debut album “PiMP,” she delivers a charmingly funny anthem to success, being yourself, and of course, Hennessy — with an easy swagger and natural charisma. The track boasts an excellent beat featuring a perfectly icy piano sample that nicely complements her verses. In the accompanying video, she casually dances at locations around her home neighborhood of Roxbury in a sharp yellow blazer with a painted cubist design. She has been receiving some well-deserved national attention particularly for this track, and it’s easy to see why.
1. “I Deserve That” by Oompa (ft. Cliff Notez)
In this uplifting track, local rapper and poet Oompa has created an anthem celebrating black and brown women and what they deserve, from joy to power. The track, from her powerfully moving 2016 debut album “November 3rd,” has a warm, lightly gospel sound, with a chipmunkified vocal sample floating helium-light. Oompa’s joyous celebration is resolutely inclusive and intersectional. She has shout-outs to both “hoes” and “CEOs,” as well as to “trans women, pan women, [and the] gender-non conforming.” She is joined by her frequent collaborator and fellow local rapper Cliff Notez, who celebrates his sisters with enthusiasm and pride in an energetic guest verse. The exceedingly charming video for the track was filmed by high school students participating in the Real to Reel Filmschool at RAW Art Works in Lynn. In the video Oompa raps and dances on the T, in front of the Museum of African American History in Roxbury, and in a classroom — she used to teach — among other locations. A number of local artists, including Billy Dean Thomas, make cameos; there’s a list of appearances at the end of the video. The video concludes with Oompa and Cliff Notez at a colorful rooftop party, radiating an easy, yet clearly hard-fought joy: A lovely conclusion to a beautiful, affecting song.

Shapeshifting quasi-human felines, demons that walk upon ceilings, and a man with a super-sharp nose, oh my! Marlon James’ latest novel “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” contains all of the above, telling the tale of a young man identified only by the nickname “Tracker” — given for his uncanny ability to locate items and people by scent alone — and his various commissions to hunt down lost possessions in strange, enchanted lands. James’ writing is gripping from the first page, crafting a world so full of culture and history that it becomes nearly real, though at times his wild descriptions and fast-moving pace can cause confusion and muddle the plot. Further, his anti-hero of a narrator is intriguing and well-fleshed out, although members of the huge supporting cast are hard to keep track of and seem disposable. While it’s too much to say that “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” redefines fantasy, its psychedelic twist on African mythology certainly brings fresh flavor to a genre that is so classically dominated by medieval European influences (think “Game of Thrones” and “Lord of the Rings”).
At the start of “Black Leopard, Red Wolf,” Tracker leaves behind his parents and his home city of Juba for the primitive village from which his family originally came, hoping to find a sense of self amidst nature and a simple way of life. While there, he embarks on a ritualized journey into the wilderness to complete his transition into manhood. Along the way, he’s unexpectedly swept away by the Leopard, a creature that appears sometimes as man and sometimes animal, to aid in the task of rescuing “mingi,” abandoned children who are thought to be cursed because of their birth defects. So begins Tracker’s acquaintance and tentative attraction to the Leopard, with whom he’ll reunite later as part of a band of mercenaries on an epic adventure to find a boy who has vanished from the clutches of a slave trader.
From the first chapter of the novel, James creates captivating structure and perspective for his storytelling. “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” begins in a prison where Tracker is being interrogated by a mysterious Inquisitor. Thus, James gives the end of the story to the reader and compels them to read on to discover how it started, effectively attracting the audience by building confusion. Further, Tracker directly addresses the reader with a scornful “you,” suggesting that they take the role of the Inquisitor and allowing them a truly immersive, intimate experience of the novel.
However, James sometimes creates too much confusion with an overload of detail while providing little fulfillment to the readers’ piqued curiosity, to the point of frustratingly obscuring the plot. For example, in the span of three pages in the second chapter, James throws out a barrage of superfluous information: explaining a particular painting “of a white creature with arms and legs tall as trees” on the wall of a witchman’s hut, telling a detailed fable of “the monkeybread tree” who angered the gods, and providing random details about how a particular “tree ate six virgins.”
On the other hand, when dialed back, James’ vivid descriptions can be one of  the highlights of his writing the cornerstones of his fantastic world-building. He often invents creative turns of phrase that circumvent the common English word that would be used in a given scenario, such as “the noon of the dead” instead of “midnight” or “the goddess who hears man’s cry and returns the same cry” rather than “echo.” James also manages to weave information about the history of his fantasy world into his imagery, packing a double punch with lines such as “I heard once that the first builders of this city… were just trying to build towers tall enough to get back to the kingdom of sky and start a war in the land of the gods.” With ingenious manipulation of language, James artfully crafts a rich culture within his novel that is distinct from reality.
On the note of characters, Tracker first appears to be a classic anti-hero who finds others’ lost possessions for the thrill of a challenge and the promise of reward rather than out of the good of his heart. However, there’s still something uniquely charming about the disparity between Tracker’s words — “nobody loves no one” — and vulnerability in his actions, such as when he is nearly brought to tears during his reunion with the Leopard after a few years apart. Despite the likeability of Tracker, many characters in the huge supporting cast — various witches, village men, queens — are introduced, then killed off or pushed into the background after they serve their purpose to the plot, thus weakening the writing.
Does “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” have a plot trajectory that generally follows that of the classic “Hero’s Journey” and a protagonist who is the definition of anti-hero? Yes, of course, but the story’s great appeal isn’t so much driven by its defiance of genre conventions but rather the mystery about just how the staples of fantasy will unfold within the confines of such a wildly different setting and cast of characters to our typical medieval European fare. “Black Leopard, Red Wolf” might not revolutionize the fantasy genre, but it’s certainly an engaging read that should be praised for its great imagination.

It would be an understatement to call the combination of an Oscar-winning director like Neil Jordan and French icon Isabelle Huppert, who has brought her talent to over 120 films, simply promising. Jordan’s latest project, the thriller “Greta,” had all the makings of a smash hit and could have been a new contribution to the Renaissance of the horror genre of recent years — just look at the compelling stories, committed performances, and high production value of films like “A Quiet Place,” “Hereditary,” and “Get Out.” Yet, somehow, the mixture of these exciting elements turned incredibly sour, resulting in a noxious two hours of tropes, forced tension, and pathetic attempts at plot twists. If anything, “Greta” should be a learning experience for any one interested in the movie industry; a screenplay can make or break the film, and in this case, it turns something with extreme potential into a borderline-comedic dumpster fire.
From the trailer to the movie poster to the very brief IMDb summary, the makers of “Greta” are very transparent about the fact that Greta (Isabelle Huppert) is an evil, possessive stalker who lures the young Frances (Chloë Grace Moretz) into her trap. This disturbed, middle aged woman leaves fancy handbags on the subways of New York, hoping someone naive enough will return the bag to her cozy apartment and become her friend. Having recently lost her mother, Frances is desperate for someone to fill that maternal void and, therefore, connects with the friendly Greta immediately. However, she quickly discovers Greta’s dark side and spends the rest of the movie trying to throw this creepy woman off her scent.
By wasting the opportunity of a big, unexpected reveal of Greta’s bad intentions, screenwriter Ray Wright shoots this film in the foot. Instead of building tension gradually and slowly hinting that something about this new-formed friendship is off, Wright gets stuck trying to fill about an hour of runtime with forced drama, a ridiculous amount of stalking, and a dragged out finale. The cacophony of loud, abrupt violins isn’t enough to bring the suspense back to life, and the film’s reliance on tired-out tropes like spooky basements, clumsy protagonists who suddenly lose every ounce of coordination, and an unbelievably careless and incompetent police force proceed to dig this film’s grave.
Maybe the most outrageous moment of the film comes in the form of a dream within a dream sequence that seems too farcical to be serious. Greta’s terrorization of Frances reaches a climax when she drugs Frances’ coffee, drags the incapacitated girl back to her cottage, and locks her up in a hidden room for good. Things are looking very bleak for the victim, when suddenly, Frances wakes up safe in her apartment with her coffee sitting safely on her end table, realizing that the kidnapping was all part of scary nightmare. It’s boggling that a filmmaker could use the “It was all just a dream” cliché unironically, especially because of how cringey the plot has been up to this point. Oh, but wait! There’s more! As Frances takes the elevator down to meet up with her father, the elevator starts to shake and shrink like a claustrophobic person’s biggest fear. She suddenly wakes up for the second time, now back in Greta’s creepy, secret room — indicating the abduction actually did happen. Such a risky and ultimately ridiculous plot point seems like it would belong much better in a spoof like the “Scary Movie” series. The most exhilarating moment of the film was probably the finale, mainly due to the sudden joy one feels at the thought of the film ending, before feeling dread upon realizing it will actually drag on longer than expected.
It feels strange to critically analyze and to give detailed attention to such an obviously bad film, but the portrayal of Greta as a stereotypical “psychopath” is too out-of-touch to ignore. She is clearly a very sick woman, traumatized by a tragic past, yet no one makes any attempt to bring her to therapy, get her diagnosed by a psychologist, or even — worst case scenario — institutionalize her. Considering the steps mental health advocates have recently made to increase awareness of mental illnesses and try to eliminate the social stigma around them, this one-dimensional “crazy lady” who is treated like an irredeemable villain feels like a step in the wrong direction.
Unlike a beautiful disaster like “Sharknado,” “Greta” likely won’t become an immortalized cult classic; it doesn’t relish in its campiness enough. Nevertheless, to anyone who decides to buy a ticket to this flick, make sure to drag a friend to the theatre and “Greta” might actually make for a cringey but funny time.

Porsha Olayiwola is the Poet Laureate of the city of Boston, a position she assumed at the start of 2019. Self-described as a “poet, queer-dyke, hip-hop feminist, and womanist” on her website, Olayiwola writes “infra-political” pieces: compositions distinguished as political due solely to the historic erasure of the identities featured. She also co-founded The House Slam, Boston’s first poetry slam venue, and serves as the Artistic Director of MassLEAP, a literary non-profit organization in Massachusetts serving youth artists. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Olayiwola about her new position, what she hopes to accomplish, and the importance of giving frequently silenced voices a chance to speak their truth.
The Harvard Crimson: When and how did you realize you maintained such a passion and talent for poetry?
Porsha Olayiwola: It's a discovery every single day. A lot of writers feel this way — it is constantly a quest for quenching and furthering the passion. I’m into inquiry, so every day I’m interested and invested in learning more.
But also, to be more specific, I have been writing for a while. Before I identified as a writer or a poet, there was a time in 2014 where I won a poetry competition, and I thought, “Hey, this something I could possibly be doing. Something somebody else thought was good — was worthy — and wanted to listen to.” I think that was the first time where I thought, “Maybe I should shift my career.”
THC: You’ve expressed your desire to give young people the freedom to express themselves through art, and the opportunity to do so. Why is artistic expression so important, and why is it specifically important to you?
PO: Artistic expression is important because it’s a necessity. It’s almost like water. Specifically for young people, it’s like, “Here are some tools, and here is a platform that says I want to hear what you think, and how you craft, and what you have to say. And I want to know what's in your mind.” I think the mind is so imaginative and so private and so intimate, but it’s also the first birthplace of the human. We exist in our minds and the world is secondary. So to tap into someone’s imagination and allow them to express themselves is a form of radical love. Young people — those who are not necessarily listened to — should know [that] we need you. We want to hear you. For anybody that’s marginalized, I think that is near life and death.
THC: You don’t shy away from discussing the intersectionality of your experiences as a black, queer woman. Have you ever felt anxious performing for crowds that don’t share your identities?
PO: Sometimes the poem has to exist. “The Joke” is a poem written about this, but also, when it is read aloud, it is meta. The poem is, in and of itself, “the joke” … So it becomes necessary, lest we balk the work. This morning I was just reading “A Litany for Survival” by Audre Lorde, and she says, “We must keep remembering we were never meant to survive.” If we remain silent, we’re afraid. If we speak, we’re afraid. So we might as well speak, knowing that it is necessary. So I have to keep those things in mind.
But also, people seem receptive! And maybe they’re not, maybe they are. Maybe they just keep it to themselves. But either way, the confrontation occurred, whether it be in their mind or in their spirit. The visibility of myself has occurred in front of their very own eyes, so I exist. I’m a whole person, and there are other people like me. So even if it doesn't spark a conversation, even if it inspiries something else, it is a form of existence. And existence is resistance.
THC: What effect do you hope your poetry, and work as Poet Laureate, will have on artists of the next generation, and the culture that those artists will exist in?
PO: I've been trying to push my work to take on a more afrofuturistic lense — magical realism, sci-fi. But also, I’m really thinking about my approach to issues as the laureate, thinking about it through a lense of radical love. I already believe in my heart that poems are an act of love. A way to know a person, or to hear a person’s voice, and see them. As the laureate, my job is to connect the whole city, so I'm constantly thinking about how I can act out of radical love. And I think radical love is futuristic. Loving people beyond what I see — which is a little magical. Beyond the hate they have given me.
THC: And do you see that as a possibility? Are you hopeful?
PO: I am the most unhopeful person ever. I often think about hope in the context of oppression. How do you keep oppression going? If you really want to destroy people, you take away their hope, or any kind of hope that they may have had. So it’s important to not lose sight of hope because if you do, that is also a tool of the oppressor. I live in Boston, and now I have this position where I am afforded the privilege to connect and work with Bostonians on every single level in a field that is very prestigious, and literary, and traditionally white-male. And so, as the position calls, and my own intersecting identities and ancestral past call, it is important for me to act out of radical love irregardless of the hope.  ​​​

“Ready for a story about superheroes? Ugh. More TV superheroes. Just what the world needs.”
So begins the pilot of “Doom Patrol,” the latest television series produced by DC Comics, the company responsible for well-known heroes such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. The company has had a turbulent history and varying success with the films and movies it produces: There are widely acclaimed gems such as 2017’s “Wonder Woman,” as well as widely criticized films such as 2016’s “Suicide Squad.” Considering these ups and downs, it was hard to know what to expect when DC announced its new roster of television shows that would be premiering on their own, independent streaming platform, DCUniverse. Of these new shows, “Doom Patrol,” with a cast of relatively unknown heroes, came off as the most obscure. However, with the show’s intense focus on character development, its strong writing, and the powerful performances from the cast, “Doom Patrol” is currently in line to become one of the stronger DC productions.

The story is relatively simple. After a terrible accident, Cliff Steele (Brendan Fraser) finds his entire body obliterated, with only his brain intact. A brilliant scientist named Niles Caulder (Timothy Dalton) finds Cliff and builds him an entirely cybernetic body, turning him into a creature known as Robotman. Cliff soon finds his place amongst Niles’ dysfunctional family, made up of several other similarly situated people: Rita Farr/Elasti-Girl (April Bowlby), Larry Trainor/Negative Man (Matt Bomer), and Crazy Jane (Diane Guerrero). But their simple life cannot last, as the monsters of the outside world and the monsters within them all seek to destroy them.

One of the greatest strengths of “Doom Patrol” is the intense focus on its characters. Unlike other DC shows, this one faces the challenge of appealing to an audience that is likely to be completely unfamiliar with its characters. Yet, “Doom Patrol” meets this challenge remarkably. These characters are some of the more complex characters that have graced the superhero scene in some time. Though they all have tragic backstories — which are by no means rare occurrences in superhero stories — the characters internalize and reflect their trauma in a way that makes them captivating to watch. They are characters worth spending a season watching.
The standout performance, however, belongs to Brendan Fraser in his role as Cliff Steele/Robotman. The first episode of the series is largely focused on his character, the accident that forced him into his new form, and his attempt to cope with it. As the human form of Cliff Steele, Brendan Fraser gets very little screen time. For the majority of the episode, Fraser portrays post-injury Cliff Steele in the form of Robotman. However, for what screen time he does get, he accurately and honestly portrays the complexities of the character. He captivatingly portrays the turmoil within Steele and his battle to make sense of the new world and new body in which he finds himself. Fraser’s performance, and the Robotman character, are easily the highlights of an already great premiere.

However, the credit cannot entirely go to the actors. The powerful writing team, spearheaded by Jeremy Carver of “Supernatural,” kicks off the new series superbly with their dialogue. Though the beginning of the episode contains some exposition-heavy narration, the quirky and humorous way it is written, coupled with the strong narration by the series villain (Alan Tudyk), make it work. The dialogue feels natural, except for the parts where it is strategically exaggerated. The breaking of the fourth-wall, though at first jarring, ends up working in favor of the show, establishing its weird and quirky nature. Furthermore, the team impressively blends moments of dark humor with dramatic and emotional moments.

Despite these strengths, the show is not perfect. There are some scenes that feel unnecessary and, at times, even gratuitous. Additionally, with the episode moving along at a rapid pace, it sometimes feels that key moments are passed over. For instance, there seems to be very little emphasis on the actual forming of the team and their relationships with each other, even though it will certainly be a focal point of the series going forward. 

Overall, the premiere of “Doom Patrol” proves to be a worthy entry in the DC Universe. With strong, complex characters, a more than capable cast, and an excellent writing team, it will be interesting to see if the show will be able to cement itself as one of the strongest contributions to the DC roster. So if you are, as the narrator says, “ready to feel better about your own miserable lives for the next hour or so,” dive into “Doom Patrol.” It should be a fun ride.

I was nine years old the first time I visited the United States of America. Sounds weird, doesn’t it? To say the whole thing like that — the United States of America, these United States of America, the American States, United. Do you hear the bald eagle screech in there, somewhere? My father sat me down before we left and said to me, “Yash, there are rules there, do you understand?” I shifted my head a degree to the right; there was a dragonfly on the window pane. “You can’t litter there.” The world was my trash can. “No sticking gum under tables.” Where else do they put their gum? “In fact, no gum — you’ll lose your teeth.” Wait, what? “I’m serious — look at me. If you throw things away on the street, they’ll arrest you. Then you can sit in jail, and we’ll come back home. Do you want that?”
Two years ago, I returned to the Clean United States of America (pristine, gum-free). Boston is tidy, dust-free, with dirt that smells like Febreze. This world is packaged in cautiously labelled cardboard boxes, taped on the top, the bottom and edges too, for good measure; this world is careful, contained. The streets are quiet, the houses plain, the cars fast, the people islands. Small bubbles, small sterile pockets of life that pass me by.
My mother jokes that our home would be easier to keep clean if my siblings and I left Kolkata. The ketchup stains on the sofa are telling; the writing on the wall in my room is telling; the chipped marble from when my dog was teething is telling. This home is lived in. “Don’t touch anything you’re not supposed to — not in a museum, not on the street.” The Clean, Dust-Free, Febrezed United States of America: Hands off! you’ll get your finger grease on everything!
At home, in Kolkata, the sky is closer to the ground. Puffs of steam rise from kettles on steep and grow up to become clouds; and little school children sprawled in the backseat of minibuses look up and count the threads in each one. When I was in the fourth grade, an English boy, Tom, joined school. He said my name like “Yass,” emphasis on the “ass.” One day in music class, our teacher was playing “Jamaica Farewell,” on the piano. Tom sat in front of me, with his long spikes of golden brown hair — his parents let him get blonde highlights — calling my name: Ass? Ass! I yanked him by his ridiculously cool hair and got up to run — a strategy that served me well, always.
“Jamaica Farewell” is a peculiar children’s song: It’s about leaving a loved one behind, never to be seen again. As my classmates sang this soft, sad song, we fought. We rolled and stumbled over each other, throwing punches wildly, our legs kicking like we’d been thrown into the deep end of a swimming pool. The music rose in crescendo; the guitar strings shouted, “Fight! Fight! Fight!” The piano was nails digging into skin; the chorus a hard push that sent us tumbling. Kolkata is this mad, mindless harmony. The city is set to music. The city is a small stone, circling the edges of a swirling eddy, tearing down a river, into its banks, into the river bed.
Oh, if only it was a painting of a stone, set in the painting of a river.
When I return to Kolkata, I’m caught off guard by how difficult it is to slip back into my old life. A small bowling alley, forgotten beside the rising slope of a bridge, under which, I have seen pigs on two different occasions, at least, has disappeared. The languages that raised me have rusted in isolation; the words sit awkwardly on my tongue, twiddling their thumbs. As I stand on the street, sipping chai with my friends, people walking past can tell that I do not live there; there is some secret code that everyone else is clued into. What is it? Tell me, please, please.
Home is neither here nor there; it was, once upon a time. That radical question of where I belong can only be answered by turning to the past, to the memories of a life simpler, easier. Home exists in the corners of my mind, tucked into my fourth birthday party, a walk through the city at midnight, the death of my grandmother. Home is known retrospectively — if you are lucky enough to have ever had one. Homesickness, as put eloquently by a professor, is ontological: It is a fundamental aspect of the human condition, a longing for the past, for a sense of belonging so primordial that it predates language, that it outweighs the weight that any word could bear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Musician Emily M. Spector ’21 premiered her latest album, “Tokens,” for a crowd of students in Winthrop Grille on Feb. 16. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Spector to discuss her album, introduction to music, and plans for the future.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get your start in music?
Emily M. Spector: If you ask my parents, they’ll tell you I started singing when I was two, which is probably true. I started playing violin when I was four, but I always had this adoration for rock. I took guitar lessons for a while. I played and sang in some jazz bands, all while still playing classical violin. At Harvard, I’m a music major and a Berklee dual-degree student. I’m involved in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO) as the General Manager and I play violin for them. I’m also part of the Administrative Board for Harvard Radio Broadcasting (WHRB) and the Chief Studio Engineer.
THC: What was your creative process for developing your newest album, “Tokens?”
EMS: I have an EP from high school called “Departed Qualities,” which helps to contextualize my newest album. I wasn’t the happiest kid in high school and the music I was writing at the time reflected that. But coming to college, so many things are different and I feel so much better. As a result what I listen to has changed and what I want to say has changed. I feel like the EP I produced in high school wasn’t the whole picture that I wanted to represent me. I’ve been writing way more this year and last year than ever before, so I had a lot of material and I decided it was time to put it out there. I was sending songs to my friends and family, saying “listen to these” — and you don’t always have this impulse. Not every song you write is a hit, but there were so many songs I felt really proud of and put so much hard work into. The production process is something I’ve always procrastinated on, but one Saturday night I just churned out all the tracks.
THC: What’s the story behind the title?
EMS: I like to think of songs as markers of time. A songwriting teacher told me, “A song is an instant.” You can’t cover that much material in three minutes. It’s a moment so you just have to pick something and say it. The songs on this album are all vignettes, little moments in time. I sing about the moments you never see coming, which is why I thought “Tokens” was so fitting.
THC: I notice that in all of your songs you’ve opted to only use your acoustic guitar, is that for a reason?
EMS: Freshman year, I got bands together and we’d rehearse. I’d have a six-piece band and we’d play shows at Queen’s Head. It was awesome. It was a great experience and I want to return to that at some point, but it wasn’t sustainable for me. When I started this year, I was going to say yes to every gig. I didn’t care where it was, I would make it work. The way that it ended up playing out was just me and my acoustic guitar. Sometimes it’d be amplified, or I’d have a friend do harmonies with me or play acoustic guitar with me. Now when I write songs I want to make sure that they can be played on guitar, that way they’re portable. I can take them anywhere, and it’s easy. It feels like a very natural and simple way to show everyone what I’m working on.”
THC: Has your time as a dual student at Berklee helped you develop your songwriting?
EMS: Going to Berklee, they purposefully crack you open. I’ve found a lot of really great co-writers at Berklee. Since a lot of songs are written by multiple people — which is the reigning model in the commercial world — this has been super useful for me. Additionally, the songwriting teachers and workshops have been great. I’m taking a workshop this semester where we have to write a song a week which has helped me prioritize songwriting.
THC: Has Harvard impacted your songwriting at all?
EMC: Last semester at Harvard, I took a class called “Music and Lyrics,” which was a class on Musical Theatre analysis and composition with my “Queen” [Dr. Katherine] Pukinskis. Instead of a final exam we could either write a research paper or a song to be in a musical, so I got to think deeply and write my first duet. Even if my dream isn’t to write a musical, it’s a valuable skill in theatricality and storytelling.
THC: Are there any similarities or differences that you tried to emphasize between this new album and your old album “Departed Qualities”?
EMS: Storytelling is a big part of my songs. I think my stories have gotten clearer and more comprehensive. In high school, I felt like I was writing to survive. There were a lot of things that I had to say and that were more for myself. The idea behind my EP was I’ll write and put them together, and if you understand them then you understand them. In “Tokens,” I wanted it to be clearer. I’ve worked on my craft and improved my storytelling skills, which makes the album different than the EP.
THC: What are your future plans concerning music?
EMS: I don’t have a set timeline, but the plan is to continue with music. I’m trying to spend the summer in Nashville, so I’m flying down during Spring Break to have a bunch of meetings with writers and publishers. I’m not sure what it’ll materialize into, but they’re all great people and I’m thinking we’ll have great conversations.

There’s nothing quite like reveling in the angst of a song you can’t understand. East Asian ballads tap into the inexplicable, wrenching aches of heartbreak, loss, or worse: the consequences of p-set procrastination. Not even the best of 2000s alt-rock can evoke the same emotion (sorry, Green Day). Anyone who has ever felt their heart melt as a plaintive power ballad blasted over a crying-in-the-rain scene of an Asian drama can attest to this. These pieces vary on the spectrum of pop and rock, but they all capture something romantic (in the nineteenth century sense of the term) to tide over turbulent souls.
“Singing Got Better” by Ailee
11. It’s still shocking that this is one of Ailee’s less popular songs, but the lyrics about her improved singing after getting her heart broken are evident in this piece’s power vocals.
“Wasted” by Younha
10. Don’t waste a second before giving a listen to this subtle pop ballad. Younha’s entire discography could probably fit on this list, but the compelling pulse of this song has a healthy chance of driving you to the fetal position when you are, well, wasted (or otherwise).
“If I Were You” by 2ne1
9. 2ne1 has plenty of classic power ballads to offer, but this one takes the cake for sheer depth of emotion in just about every performance. It wouldn’t be wrong to put on a live recording of this when you have three and a half minutes to spend enraptured (so, 2 a.m. on a Tuesday).
“Rain Love” by Rainie Yang
8. This 2000s Mando-pop ballad featuring Yang’s mellow voice make for a perfect accompaniment a wet Cambridge afternoon, complete with a plaintive electric guitar solo and a weirdly relatable shot of Yang eating cake alone in front of a refrigerator full of water bottles in the music video.
“Sleep” by Sid
7. By the end of the live performance of this piece, the band’s lead singer is kneeling and hunched over on the stage, crushed by the weight of the Japanese rock feels, which sums up this song pretty well.
“He Isn’t Worth It by Shi Shi
6. This absolute jam from a relatively unknown Taiwanese-Korean artist was on the original soundtrack of the 2016 Taiwanese melodrama “Behind Your Smile.” Inspired by the fantastically problematic romance at the core of the show, the deliciously angry song is definitely worth a listen.
“Congratulations” by Day 6
5. Congratulations! This fantastic song has now entered your life. This passive aggressive jam congratulating a significant other for moving on shines with the capacity to not get old after a dozen replays.
“Breathe” by Lee Hi
4. Lee Hi performs this song with beautiful care and delicacy. While you might listen to other songs on this list in fits of rage or despair, this loving call to slow down and breathe is never not relevant background music for the rat race.
“Blue” by Big Bang
3. It’s not necessarily true that this song is deeply underrated, per se, but Big Bang often gets lost in modern k-pop discourse. The mix of electronic and acoustic elements here are actually surprisingly upbeat for a song about “singing the blues,” but that just goes to show how many shades there are to the angsty pseudo-ballad genre.
“I Need Somebody” by Day 6
2. This song starts off fairly calm and escalates into one of the band’s most rock-inspired works. The chorus’s inquiry, “Why am I alone?” will continue to confound you as the one question your good TF can’t answer.
“Haru Haru” by Big Bang
1. This song is first, because how could anything else be first? You will learn to belt this song without knowing the language. Also, if you’ve ever wanted to bop to a sad song (because why not), this song goes above and beyond for the task.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lana Del Rey was once just a misty chanteuse who only sang sad songs, always sort of there in the popular imagination, with her big eyes and long false lashes which she blinked slowly and languidly. Her soft lush beats and versatile voice, which she dares to make her trademark dark contralto, and lyrics that make you worry for her life, because you can never quite tell if they are real or if they are subtitles for a melodramatic Hollywood fantasy… Let it wash it over you every night, and wake up the next morning feeling somehow refreshed and safer.
Get ready for this top five that features Lana’s best, including a little bit from every album, and not the famousand expected singles like “Summertime Sadness.” Take a little escape through your headphones from all the craziness of school, to California beaches or a dark paradise.
5. “Mariners Apartment Complex” from “Norman Fucking Rockwell” (coming 2019)
“Think about it, the darkness, the deepness. / All the things that make me who I am.”
This is a soft, moody one, but with Lana’s newly evolved sense of quiet positivity and forgiveness. Dreamy synth floats above the cool, busy rhythm of her singing, which mimics the ocean waves that she sings about. The music video is understated black and white. She sits in white tennis shoes and plays with a butterfly with her friend. Good for when you need a comforting voice to get you through your midterms, because Lana’s got you — as she tells you, “I’m your man.”
4. “High by the Beach” from “Honeymoon” (2015)
“All I wanna do is get high by the beach. / Get high by the beach get high.”
This is a dreamy one, and the music video is... something. She floats around her beach house, until she pulls a machine gun out of her guitar case and shoots down a helicopter which had been tailing her as paparazzi. But all she really wants to do is to get high by the beach. Good for when you want to get away from it all, from the cold Boston winters and long nights in Lamont, and just run away to California, pitch a tent in the sand and “get high by the beach get high.”
3. “Brooklyn Baby” from “Ultraviolence” (2014)
“Yeah my boyfriend’s pretty cool. / But he’s not as cool as me.”
This song will fulfill your fantasies of “churning out novels like / Beat poetry on Amphetamines.” Soft guitar strums and drum beats welcome in Lana’s voice, which floats above the fray and sounds like it is coming from far away — Good for midday naps.
2. “Video Games” from “Born to Die” (2011)
“It’s better than I ever even knew. / They say that the world was built for two.”
This is her classic, the first song that made her famous, a must-listen. Her soft low drawl is unforgettable, and you’ve probably heard it before in the supermarket. Good for when all you really want in life is beer, video games all day, and true love.
1. “Old Money” from “Ultraviolence” (2014)
“Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine. / Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine.”
It’s hard to write about this one, because it’s hard to write about things you love the most. This one is so simple, just her voice and a lonely piano for most of it, dreaming of past days of old money and glamour (probably a nod to the song she wrote for the “Great Gatsby” film.) Nostalgia and longing for home fills this song, and in such simple words: “But if you send for me you know I’ll come. / But if you call for me you know I’ll run. / I’ll run to you I’ll run run run. / I’ll come to you I’ll come come come.”
Honorable mention: “Lust for Life” Album Trailer
Lana plays a fortune teller or witch in a Twilight Zone-style version of Hollywood that was the setting in the trailer for“Lust for Life.” She paces around a small apartment in the middle of the “H” of the Hollywood sign, and prepares to cast a magic spell. (Witchcraft seems to be one of her new interests — last year, she announced on Twitter that she tried to hex Donald Trump when he was elected president. Do you think it worked?) “What shall I cook up for the kids today?” she asks as she brings her hands together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday was the fifth Monday of the semester, the last day to add or drop a course at Harvard. Of course, switching into a new class after missing four weeks of coursework is challenging, and it seems reasonable that the University would limit any additions after that time period. However, there is no similarly compelling reason for why courses must be dropped before such an early date.
Having an early course drop deadline leads to student anxiety. Through my role as a sophomore advisor and entryway tutor, I’ve had many conversations with students who must decide whether or not to take a class before they fully understand the course’s demands. While resident tutors encourage advisees not to overextend themselves, this policy hampers students’ ability to balance their classes, because the four weeks of class before the add/drop deadline are not always representative of the rest of the semester. Often, the first midterm occurs just after the deadline, locking students into the course even if they realize it’s not for them. Furthermore, students can have anxiety over whether or not to drop a course or possibly end up with “withdraw” on their transcript if they take two additional weeks to decide.
Even more importantly, an early drop deadline discourages students from trying new topics. With more flexibility, students can try out new classes and take a deep dive into the topic before deciding if they want to stick with it. This exploration promotes intellectual growth and should be central to any liberal arts college experience. We are always trying to teach students to take ownership over their learning, but an early drop deadline often forces them to take the safer path.
Instead, Harvard should move its drop deadline later into the semester, and there is precedent from peer institutions to do so. I did my undergraduate studies at Brown University, where students can drop a course until the last day of classes for the semester. I’m now a researcher at MIT, where students can drop courses until a few weeks prior to the last day of classes. While I would vote for a similar policy here, I understand that these may be too extreme for Harvard. I think it is entirely reasonable that Harvard could postpone the drop deadline to the seventh Monday (six weeks into school) or later, and the withdraw deadline could be further postponed or even eliminated.
Of course, there are also reasons for having the drop deadline where it is. One key reason is for administrative purposes such as finalizing course teaching staff. When I was a graduate student here at Harvard, I was on the teaching staff of several classes of various sizes, and it would have been disruptive if many students left partway through the semester. It would be even more disruptive in seminar-type courses, where participation from and interaction with fellow students are integral to learning. Yet in my experience, most students finalize their course schedule well in advance of the drop deadline (I never took advantage of the policy at Brown). Additionally, the teaching staff can be finalized after four weeks even if some students drop the course later in the semester. Brown and MIT can serve as models to develop systems that work.
There is also room for gaming the system with a later drop deadline, by taking five classes and dropping the one where you have the lowest grade. However, since students cannot register for more than five courses without their Resident Dean’s approval, and students are still required to complete 32 courses to graduate, these extended policies would not cause widespread adding and dropping. Brown did find that 40 percent of their drops occur in the last two weeks of classes, which would be disruptive to courses but could be avoided with a mid-semester drop deadline. Moreover, the students who would benefit the most from a later drop deadline are students who are experiencing extenuating circumstances that the University should strive to help.
A later drop deadline empowers students to take control of their academic career by taking a course on a topic in which they may not be confident, and thus it would encourage healthy risk taking and promote intellectual growth. For example, a friend of mine at Brown took a political science course one fall semester, but it ended up being too challenging when combined with his four other science courses. He dropped it after Thanksgiving. He likely would not have taken it at all if the drop deadline was earlier in the semester. Yet, the later deadline allowed him to explore a new area of academic thought, and he learned a lot more about the topic than he would have otherwise. Isn’t learning and growth the entire point of coming to college?

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. But if it is broke, don’t just rearrange the useless debris and then tell us it’s fixed.
The College has flagrantly violated this second dictum with its recent revisions to the General Education requirements. Everyone knew that the previous system was flawed because there seemed to be no reason why certain classes counted and other classes did not. One expected, therefore, that the new system would increase the ways in which to satisfy the requirements.
A superficial attempt at this goal was made in the new Distribution Requirements, which do allow, for example, students who have taken one Aesthetics and Culture class to fulfill the required second with any class categorized as Arts and Humanities. This appears to be an improvement on the previous rule, which required that classes be explicitly marked as Gen Eds, but all it has really done is confuse people.
Several classes that counted as Gen Eds in the previous schema have been stripped of their designation, and the main problem of obviously suitable courses’ failing to count has in no way been solved.
All this seems to be the result of equivocation about the goals of the Gen Ed program. It is certainly not attempting to be a unifying curriculum like Columbia’s Core, in which everyone takes the same set of classes. Not even Expository Writing, required of the freshmen, does that, for every section is focused on a different subject. On the other hand, the Gen Ed program is not trying to force students to have a deep taste of many disciplines, or else it wouldn’t let people away with taking Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Ancient Egypt.”
The report published in 2015 by the General Education Review Committee accused the old program of precisely this confusion, namely attempting to be at once a distribution system and a general education system. One of the options the committee proposed as a remedy was the “mixed model,” synthesizing (rather than confounding) both systems by pairing the compatible Gen Ed categories (such as Science of Living Systems and Science of the Physical Universe) and requiring one class in each pair to be specifically designed for general education, while the other would be a departmental class in an appropriate field.
I myself think the pure gen-ed system of Columbia or the University of Chicago is the correct way of creating the well-rounded citizen, but the committee’s proposal was reasonable and defensible. Nevertheless it rests entirely on the expectation that the Gen Ed courses will be designed afresh to be truly general, like Humanities 10a: “A Humanities Colloquium,” rather than unnervingly particular, like Aesthetics and Interpretation 63: “East Asian Cinema.” The crux of the affair is the elimination of most of the courses marked primarily as Gen Ed and their replacement with a few classes that deal broadly yet rigorously with “the big questions.” Otherwise this whole endeavor will have been merely polishing the doorknobs in a hoarder’s house.
Look, for instance, at a class such as Physics 101: “Foundations of Theoretical Physics.” This is an extremely clever course designed to bridge the yawning chasm between Astronomy 2: “Celestial Navigation,” which no self-respecting person would even confess to have taken, and Physics 15a: “Introductory Mechanics and Relativity,” which requires much more time in section than most English concentrators are prepared to tolerate. Physics 101, however, was ingeniously designed so as to treat serious, legitimate subject matter across the gamut of theoretical physics without drowning the interested humanities students.
Designing Gen Eds for the natural sciences is difficult, of course, for the average physics concentrator is probably better able to read Shakespeare than the average history concentrator is to do wave equations, and it is far easier to conceive of a broad yet unified and rigorous introduction to literature than to science. Physics 101 nonetheless achieves its goal admirably and should be a model for a science Gen Ed, but under the current system it counts for nothing.
Meanwhile, there are persons at the College who have taken extremely advanced physics classes but have not completed their SPU requirement.
How to explain this? One might suggest that the advanced physics student has taken classes that are too particular, so they oughtn’t count for Gen Ed. Fine, but Physics 101 is plenty general. One certainly hopes that the awkward transitional winter in which we are now discontented will yield to an at least passable summer of curricular coherence, but for that to happen in — real seasons now — Fall 2019 would require that squirreled away in every department office a team of experts were furiously designing truly general courses to be implemented next academic year. Something tells me this is not happening, so next semester we shall likely be back swearing loudly at our my.Harvard profiles just the same as we heretofore have been.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent incidents of people falling asleep in the Smith Campus Center have prompted action from security staff and campus police officers, who have responded by waking individuals in certain cases. The new campus space has clearly become a popular location for brief rests, but while tired students also have dorm rooms to retire to, many less fortunate residents have found the building a respite from the brutal Cambridge winter. We call on Harvard to ensure it treats members of our community resting in the Smith Campus Center with utmost respect, including those experiencing homelessness.
Harvard University Police Department has stated they have enforced the building’s no-sleeping policy humanely and without prejudice. We hope they continue to do so in future incidents. We also support HUPD’s greater efforts to maintain order and safety on our campus, but hope it and the University as a whole is always cognizant of treating all individuals with respect.
Moreover, the University and the staff at the Smith Campus Center should be equitable in their enforcement of the building’s no-sleeping policy, making sure not to target individuals experiencing homelessness to a greater degree than students, who also have been known to use the building as a convenient spot for a nap. A policy meant to limit potential liabilities and prevent safety issues is understandable, but we cannot support it if it is found that it is being enforced unequally on the basis of University affiliation.
While sleeping in the Smith Campus Center is not exclusive to homeless individuals, these incidents specifically call attention to the pervasive problem of homelessness in our community. According to the Cambridge Department of Municipal Services Program, the number of unsheltered and emergency-sheltered individuals rose between 2017 and 2018. Harvard Square has consistently been at the heart of that growing population. To their credit, Harvard students have certainly worked hard to support local homeless individuals, and we laud their efforts. In particular, the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y demonstrate a meaningful awareness of and commitment to that community within the student body. But these students should not be acting alone. Rather than having much of the burden fall on student-run groups, we call on the University to do more to support and fund efforts to assist and protect the Harvard Square homeless population.
As we have opined previously, the message Harvard sends by keeping the Smith Campus Center open to the community is certainly a positive one. However, it only stands so if the University treats all its visitors with equal dignity and respect. That begins with the way individuals experiencing homelessness are treated. These individuals seek refuge in our spaces not out of preference, but because many often have few other places to go.
Rising rates of homelessness are a major issue facing our community. As homeless individuals find refuge in Harvard spaces, the University should not only wake them up with compassion, but also think critically about how it can contribute to the needs of the homeless in our community more broadly, especially given its outsize presence and impact within the greater Cambridge community. We hope these incidents spark a greater sense of action and urgency within the University to take important, equitable steps to help address them as soon as possible.

Former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will lead a climate review to address concerns from Winthrop House residents over Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to represent film producer Harvey Weinstein, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote to house affiliates in an email Monday morning.
The review comes as a product of College and Faculty of Arts and Science procedures to gather information amid "climate concerns," according to Khurana's email. He added that students previously shared concerns about support for students within Winthrop and the house environment.
“When climate concerns arise in a faculty-led unit, the College and the FAS have procedures in place to gather additional information to assess the situation and to provide confidentiality to those participating in the information gathering process,” he wrote. “In this situation, we would like to have a more complete understanding of the current environment at Winthrop House.”
The New York Post first reported Sullivan planned to join Weinstein’s legal team Jan. 23 as he faces five charges of sexual assault in a Manhattan court.
Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein sparked student demonstrations, op-eds, and letters calling for Sullivan’s removal from his position as faculty dean. Tutors in more than half of Harvard’s residential houses — including Winthrop — have held listening sessions for concerned students, many staffed by a representative from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Following student scrutiny of his decision, Sullivan sent two missives to House affiliates. In one, he wrote about defense lawyers’ duty to represent “unpopular defendants” and highlighted his career as a defense attorney. In the other, he laid out a set of “processes” he and fellow Winthrop Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson planned to implement — including designating Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the “point person” for issues related to sexual assault in the house.
The review has two parts: discussions between Winthrop affiliates and College officials, and an online climate survey run by the Office of Institutional Research — Harvard’s internal research arm. Both are voluntary and intended to gather anonymous, aggregate information, which will then be shared with Khurana.
Khurana wrote that Dingman will contact Winthrop affiliates with further information about the survey. The College will use the information from the survey to take “actions, as appropriate.”
On Feb. 11, Khurana wrote in a statement emailed to The Crimson that he had met with Sullivan to discuss the “responsibilities” he holds as faculty dean. In a Feb. 15 interview, Khurana said he passed along feedback from College affiliates during those conversations.
“We've been actively engaged with Professor Sullivan and so I'm actively in communication with him, specifically sharing what I'm hearing from members of the community and what they're describing their needs so that Professor Sullivan can adjust to those needs,” Khurana said in the interview.
When asked to evaluate Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein in that interview, Khurana pointed to what he called faculty members’ “academic freedom.”

The Hong Kong restaurant will feature a live music venue on the third floor of its Harvard Square location starting next month.
The new plans for the third floor will include live performances as well as DJ events and dancing after 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. In previous years, the third floor of the Mass. Avenue building has served as a comedy room with a 100-person capacity, but it has “gone unoccupied” for roughly the past year, according to Daniel R. Carswell, the new venue booker for Hong Kong.
Carswell said the owners of Hong Kong, Evelyn and Paul Lee, reached out to him to see if live music could be incorporated into their restaurant. Carswell, who has also worked at Charlie’s Kitchen for the past five years, said he is hoping to revive the space at Hong Kong while giving local and traveling bands a chance to showcase their music.
The new live music venue will mostly host punk rock, indie rock, electronic dance music, and metal, but it is expected to expand outside those genres as well, according to Carswell.
“We’re open to any genre,” Carswell said. “We kind of do everything and anything.”
Carswell described the current third floor setup as having a “modest sound system” and a “small stage,” but he said he believes the restaurant can use the space for something “bigger and cooler” in the future.
Some students said they are excited to see a new music venue coming to Harvard Square, especially given all the turnover in the area in recent months.
Lauren A. Church ’21 said she is ready for a fresh addition to the Square.
“It’ll probably be exciting to see something in the Square besides food,” she said.
Chung Yi See ’22 said he appreciates the variety the music venue will bring to the Square.
“I think it’s great,” See said. “All the new stuff coming to the Square is really entertaining, so it’s good to have some diversity.”
Carswell said he expects Hong Kong to host a few shows per week “depending on demand and the shows that come through.”
The cover cost for shows will vary between $5-15 and all performances will be 21+.
The debut show will cost $8 and is slated for March 21 at 8 p.m. with performances by The Berries — a Seattle-based band — and two local bands, The Dazies and Love Strangers.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office announced Harvard will host its first gender equity summit — “Harvard Hears You: The 2019 Summit for Gender Equality” — on April 2 in an email to University affiliates Monday.
The event, jointly organized by the University’s Title IX Office and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, will include panels, talks, and question-and-answer sessions. The University timed the event to coincide with the first day undergraduates can access the 2019 Association of American Universities’ sexual conduct climate survey, according to University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill.
“As we were talking about pulling together an event on this subject, we also were mindful of the fact that we are about to embark on administering the 2019 AAU survey,” Merhill said in an interview. Her office oversees gender and sex-based harassment prevention and education initiatives on campus.
Harvard first participated in the survey in 2015 and announced last semester it would be joining the second iteration.
“Since the time of the first survey, the University has taken many, many steps to change things, to improve things for students,” Merhill said. “But we also recognize we have a long way to go, and the way to measure how we can do better is through looking at what progress we’ve made between 2015 and 2019.”
Monday’s “Save the Date” email described the event as including a number of panels, “TED-style” talks, and onstage interviews. There will also be a celebrity panel featuring unnamed guests.
“Candid discussions about key issues in the current climate including social movements, due process, and intersectional approaches to equity will be encouraged,” the unsigned email reads.
Merhill and Theodore J. Gilman, the Weatherhead Center’s executive director, said that “Harvard Hears You” is intended to both encourage participation in the survey and to spark conversations about gender equity on campus.
Merhill said the Title IX Office wanted to approach the summit’s subject on University, national, and global scales. The programming is meant to be flexible, so that students may engage with the conference as their schedules allow; programming will begin at 10 a.m.
“We want this consumable in bite-sized pieces, so if you’re passing through the Smith Center, and you happen to see that there’s a big crowd, and you want to check it out, you can,” Gilman said.
The event speaker list features faculty and staff across the University, including Bacow, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Business School Professor Kathleen McGinn, and Academic Dean of the Kennedy School Iris Bohnet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 3,300 economists, a number of whom are Harvard affiliates, signed the “Economists’ Statement on Carbon Dividends,” calling for a bipartisan climate change solution, the Climate Leadership Council announced last month.
The economists are specifically supporting the Baker-Schulz plan, which was authored by former Republican Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz in 2017. The statement comprises four main pillars: gradually increasing a carbon fee, returning all proceeds from the fee to Americans via dividends, instituting border carbon adjustments, and eliminating regulations that are no longer necessary upon the fee’s enactment.
The statement is the largest of its kind, with a historic number of economists signing onto it, including 27 Nobel Laureates, four former Federal Reserve Chairs, 15 former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers, and two former Secretaries of the Treasury, one of whom is former University President and current Economics Professor Lawrence H. Summers. Other Harvard signatories include Economics Professors N. Gregory Mankiw, Jason Furman '92, John Y. Campbell, Claudia D. Goldin, and Martin S. Feldstein '61.
“I’ve been working with the Secretary of State on the so-called carbon dividends plan with the four parts inscribed in the statement for the last several years,” Summers said in an interview. “And there’s a broader and broader coalition that has supported this idea. It seemed like a natural idea to mobilize the support of Congress over a broader swathe of economists to show that this wasn’t a left wing idea or a right wing idea, it was just a good idea.”
The economists’ carbon dividends plan aims to be a first step in solving climate change through a carbon tax based on basic economic principles. Campbell said the focus of the policy is using a price mechanism to deter carbon emissions.
Campbell added that he believes the field of economics must help contribute to a solution to climate change, which he called “perhaps the most serious problem facing humanity at this point.” He noted that a large part of the statement’s success arose from mobilizing support from economists from both political parties.
Summers said having a breadth of economists display their support is crucial to illustrating that climate change is not only a pressing issue, but one that can be combated.
“It reflects both a belief that climate change is a profoundly important issue and a kind of optimism that it’s an issue that can be addressed and so that’s why I was pleased to sign on it,” Summers said.
Campbell said the carbon tax cannot be the only solution in mitigating climate change issues, but it is a valuable “tool” in the process.
“The task of reducing carbon emissions is such a heavy lift that trying to do it without a carbon tax is like trying to lift a heavy weight without a lever,” Campbell explained. “Economists know something about how the price mechanism can be used as a tool.”
The Students for Carbon Dividends organization — a national bipartisan coalition organized around the carbon dividends plan — helped the Climate Leadership Council rally economists to sign the statement, according to S4CD’s Vice President Kiera E. O’Brien ’20.
“We do recognize that as young people we are the people who have the most at stake with the issue of climate change,” O’Brien said regarding S4CD's stake in the issue. “I felt it was so crucial that young voices be a made a part of the conversation.”
Alexander Posner, a Yale University student and President of S4CD, said the organization worked “hundreds and hundreds of hours” to garner support for the statement.
“The Climate Leadership Council reached out to us in December and said, ‘We’re organizing what we hope to be a historic statement of economists, and we need your help,’” Posner said. “So our student team got together and worked on that over winter break. Hundreds and hundreds of hours. Thousands and thousands of websites, scraping for information.”
The extent of support represents a groundbreaking show of force from the economics profession, Posner said.
"What’s exciting about this is that it’s an opportunity to marry theory and practice," Posner said. "It drives emission reductions while adhering to free market principles which creates a basis of bipartisan interest."
In terms of the prospects of the carbon dividends statement, Summers said he is hopeful that it will soon come to fruition.
“I don’t think it’s terribly likely to happen during the Trump Administration, but I hope at some point the world will move in this direction,” Summers said. “This has the potential to show that we can do big things, that we can do bipartisan things, and that economic tools and the environment don’t have to be in conflict.”

Harvard University police are investigating graffiti found Monday morning that called for Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. to step down from his position.
A vandal used white spray paint to cover exterior doors and walls of each of the house’s three buildings — Beren, Standish, and Gore — with slogans reading “Down w Sullivan!,” “Your Silence is Violence,” “Whose Side Are You On?,” and “Our Rage is Self Defense.” Separately, students distributed flyers early Monday morning soliciting feedback on Sullivan’s recent decisions to publicly defend film producer Harvey Weinstein and Economics Professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr., both of whom are accused of sexual misconduct.
Sullivan, who is also a Harvard Law School professor, has faced student scrutiny since the New York Post reported on Jan. 23 that he would join Weinstein’s legal team as Weinstein faces five counts of sexual abuse in a Manhattan court.
Two days after the Post story, Sullivan wrote an email to Winthrop residents defending his decision to join Weinstein’s legal team and wrote that defense lawyers have a duty to represent the “unpopular defendant.”
On Jan. 27, Sullivan criticized Harvard’s handling of three investigations into allegations Fryer sexually harassed women at his research lab in an article published by RealClearInvestigations. Sullivan — who was identified as Fryer’s lawyer in the article — called Harvard’s inquiries “deeply flawed and deeply unfair.”
Sullivan then followed up with another email to Winthrop residents on Feb. 4 — this time outlining “processes” that he and fellow Winthrop Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson planned to implement. The processes included appointing Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers as the “point person” for sexual assault issues.
In the weeks following the announcement that Sullivan had joined Weinstein’s legal team, some students called for him to resign as faculty dean in protests, op-eds, and open letters.
In response to Winthrop residents’ concerns, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana emailed House affiliates Monday announcing that former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 will lead a “climate review” to collect student responses to Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein.
Shortly after finding the graffiti and flyers, Winthrop House staff called Harvard University Police Department to launch an investigation, which is ongoing, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an emailed statement.
Sullivan and Robinson sent an email to Winthrop affiliates later that morning condemning the vandalism.
“It bears emphasizing that criminal acts of vandalism have no place at Harvard College,” the email reads. “They violate our commitment to truth, our commitment to community, and our commitment to civil discourse and the robust exchange of ideas.”
While Sullivan and Robinson’s email did not describe the vandalism or directly address the criticisms he currently faces, it contained several paragraphs reaffirming the College’s commitment to a “robust exchange of ideas” and praising Winthrop residents’ conduct.
“We are proud of the manner in which Winthropians have responded to other various forms of provocation over the past three weeks,” the email reads.
Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20, a Crimson Design editor, organized the production and distribution of flyers along with members of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an anti-sexual assault advocacy organization. The flyers were left in Winthrop’s dining hall and under some residents’ doors. Mudannayake said she and the other organizers were unaware of the graffiti until after it had been removed.
Some students said they had concerns about the spray-painted messages. Winthrop residents Sarah E. O’Keeffe ’20 and Amy E. Morrisett ’19 both said they thought the graffiti was not an appropriate way to express concerns about Sullivan.
“The graffiti seems kind of violent to me,” O’Keeffe said. “I recognize that Ron’s in a position where it’s more important because he’s a house administrator, but I’m just kind of uncomfortable with how people expect more of him.”
Morrisett added that while she is concerned about Sullivan’s decision, she disagrees with the vandal’s response.
“I’m not really happy with how this stuff has gone down, but I don’t really know if the vandalism is the way to respond to it,” she said.

Cambridge City Council passed an amendment that will impose a one year moratorium on cutting down trees in the city as part of an ongoing conservation effort at its weekly meeting Monday.
The ordinance bans granting permits for removing trees except in special circumstances, such as for trees classified as “dead” or “dangerous” by the city's arborist. Any violations of the proposed ban would be subject to municipal fines up to $5,000. The measure passed by a vote of 7-2, with Councillors Denise Simmons and Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., voting in opposition. The moratorium will officially go into effect March 11.
The City Council previously debated this amendment during a meeting in January, as well as at an Ordinance Committee meeting earlier this month. The committee voted to send the proposal back before the Council to be voted on.
In an interview Monday night following the vote, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux said she was pleased the amendment had passed, but she also said the moratorium is a “not the final product” and will act as a “stopgap” while the Council looks to enact more conservation policies.
“We are losing trees right, left, and center, it is alarming” she said during the council meeting on Monday. “This set of amendments is not going to stop all tree loss, but it sends a very strong signal.”
Several councillors offered their support for the amendment, but pointed to its flaws. Councillor Dennis J. Carlone voiced his concern over the vague definitions of which trees are eligible to be removed, specifically citing those considered “dangerous.”
Others, like Councillor Toomey, argued that the moratorium is unfairly “punitive” toward Cambridge residents.
“Government sometimes gets in the way,” Toomey said at the meeting. “I just think this amendment as proposed is just going to be very detrimental to the innocent property owner who is just going to be attacked for removing a tree.”
During the public comment portion of the meeting, over a dozen residents shared their opinions of the amendment proposal in front of the council. The majority argued in favor of its passage, but others, such as Denise A. Jillson, a Cambridge resident and the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, opposed it.
“There are issues that property owners will be confronted with, and you’re making it extremely difficult for us to take action when action needs to be taken,” she said.
Though many residents indicated their support for the moratorium, some had concerns over its limitations. Cambridge resident Judy Johnson argued that without further clarification, the measure would be insufficient to protect enough trees.
“Don't let trees be cut down because of mistakes in the process,” she said. “This is the beginning of our campaign to protect trees.”
Before voting, Mayor Marc C. McGovern and Councillor Alanna M. Mallon urged people to consider and act on issues with the same fervor as tree conservation.
“I am really looking for everyone to be as passionate about those really critical issues for our vulnerable population,” Mallon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The two new Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Diversity and Inclusion Fellows plan to provide better support for BGLTQ students and students from underrepresented backgrounds, the fellows wrote in emails to The Crimson.
New Fellows Andrew A. Westover and Xavier J. Du Maine began earlier this month, joining inaugural Fellow Alyssa M. Hernandez in the role. The school specifically charged one of the fellows with providing “stronger and better support” for BGLTQ students, according to Dean of Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila M. Thomas.
After creating the Fellowship last spring, the GSAS Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs decided to add a BGLTQ-focused fellow this year. After a year on the job, 2018 Fellows Alfredo M. Valencia — who stepped down at the end of 2018 — and Hernandez approached Thomas and requested more specialized help on BGLTQ matters.
“They came to us and said ‘You know what, it was a good start, but it would be great to have an additional fellow, and for that fellow to be solely focused on the LGBTQ community,’” Thomas said. “We heard the suggestion and found a way to get the funds for it.”
Westover, a Ph.D. candidate in Ethics and Education, has prioritized BGLTQ activism while at GSAS, serving as an organizer for several affinity groups. He also served on the Dean’s Advisory Committee for Equity and Diversity and the Implementation Working Group for the President’s Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging.
GSAS administrators decided to hire a BGLTQ-focused fellow after student group LGBTQ@GSAS sent messages to administrators and posted on social media last year, calling for more BGLTQ-oriented resources.
Westover said he anticipates his new position will allow him to begin addressing some of students’ past concerns.
“I share ODMA’s commitment to an intersectionally inclusive environment, one where all students can thrive and grow academically and personally,” Westover wrote.
“There is a real need for strong support for LGTBQ+ students. Diversity and inclusion are integral to the university's core functions,” Westover added.
While Westover plans to focus on supporting BGLTQ students, Du Maine wrote in an email that he hopes to begin addressing the struggles that students from underrepresented backgrounds face.
Du Maine wrote that he knew Harvard would be “academically challenging” and an “invigorating environment,” but did not expect the mental and emotional strain he experienced soon after arriving on campus as a Ph.D. candidate in Biological and Biomedical Sciences.
“In addition to all these challenges, underrepresented students have to face the hurdles of finding community and a sense of belonging at an institution where they are in the minority, and navigating environments where people don't always embrace or understand their identities,” Du Maine wrote.
At Harvard, Du Maine has been involved in a number of diversity and outreach groups aimed at supporting high school, college, and graduate students. He added that his experiences with these groups will inform his work as a fellow.
“First and foremost, I aim to listen. While I have a lot of ideas I want to get off the ground, I must first listen to students and affinity group leaders to know exactly what personal and systemic challenges they face,” Du Maine wrote.
Du Maine wrote that he plans to work to increase collaboration between student affinity groups at GSAS as well as increase the Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs’ student involvement, in an effort to “make sure no underrepresented student slips through the cracks.” He also plans to create programming to encourage students of all backgrounds to feel comfortable sharing their identities and cultures while learning to better integrate them into their future careers.
“In order for underrepresented students in GSAS to thrive, we not only need rigorous academic training but also a culture and environment that supports every aspect of who we are and celebrates the unique perspectives we bring to the table,” Du Maine wrote.

The Harvard women’s squash team finished its historic season over the weekend in the national Championship with yet another shutout 9-0 win. The Crimson swept No. 3 Trinity for its fifth-consecutive Howe Cup. Though the team has obviously retained an impressive level of squash excellence, this season was even more remarkable than the previous four, as every single player on the team went undefeated.
“We just never wanted to let up,” senior Sabrina Sobhy said. “We started winning 9-0 every match and then two-thirds into the season we thought, ‘wow do you realize nobody has lost a match yet?’”
This inevitably created high pressure for the players heading into the championship weekend.
“There’s no need to add any pressure and no one really spoke about it, but our undefeated streak just kept adding self-pressure because nobody wanted to be the one to break it,” Sobhy continued. “We added a lot of pressure on ourselves [this weekend], but the way we executed and the way we took the pressure and calmed ourselves down and changed our mindset proved successful in the end.”
Sobhy was one of two matches that went to four games. She lost the first game to Trinity’s Luz Sarahi Lopez Dominguez 11-6. However, she refused to be the one player to break the perfect season; Sobhy rebounded and fought back to win the next three games, 11-3, 11-3, and 11-8, respectively.
“Honestly, I just wanted to enjoy it especially because it was my last team national Championship,” Sobhy explained. “I really just love this team so much; I wanted to play my best for them.”
The only other match to go to four games was on the third court, where Harvard junior Amelia Henley was competing against Trinity junior Salma Alam El Din. The match was incredibly intense, as Henley lost the first game 11-5 amidst controversial rulings. Similar to Sobhy, the competitive mindset set in, and Amelia recovered, winning the following three games 13-11, 11-9, and 11-8.
Henley’s impressive win was a huge moment of the weekend for her junior teammate Gina Kennedy, even though Kennedy won her own match, 11-4, 12-10, and 11-5.
“Amelia Henley was on right before me and she had a really tight match,” recounted Kennedy. “I just remember watching that game and being really nervous because I was about to go on, but she pulled out a really good win, so I think that was the highlight of my weekend.”
Though the team only needed to win five courts every match to extend its 65-game winning streak, the Crimson refused to let up a single game this entire season, winning all 117 individual matches played. Even if the Howe Cup might have been an expectation for this dominant team, the national championship win was special for each and every Harvard player.
“This one feels different because none of our players have lost once this year,” said Kennedy. “In my past couple of years it’s been super exciting, but this year, after Sabrina won the last match and when we realized we had the actual perfect season, it was so awesome to be able to celebrate everyone’s wins.”
Despite the team’s impressive dominance over the past half-decade, it somehow managed to improve this season. Sobhy and Kennedy both attributed this team’s excellence to the team dynamic.
“Everyone is always early to practice, not because we’re told to be early, but just because that’s the nature of our team,” said Kennedy, offering an example of the team dynamic.
“Squash is such a priority for everyone; it’s not just an additional thing, it’s a part of who we are. We are just all dedicated and self-motivated.”
Sobhy elaborated on this positive team chemistry.
“Everybody has always been supportive no matter what and that adds extra motivation behind each match,” explained Sobhy. “We’re not playing to win only for ourselves; we’re putting in the extra effort for our teammates.”
Though squash is a sport of individual matches and mindsets, this season’s unprecedented success came about through the emphasis on winning for the team.

This past weekend, the Harvard track and field team competed at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships on the Crimson’s very own Gordon Indoor Track. With an energetic home crowd behind them, the team had a slew of strong performances. The men’s side took home third in the final team totals, while the women finished second after standout races from their hurdles, jumps, and short sprints athletes.
TUNTIVATE WINS 3K — with one shoe— & 5K
Senior distance runner Kieran Tuntivate had a dominant performance this past weekend, finishing atop the 3K leaderboard despite losing his shoe on the first lap of the race.
“When the shoe came off, I was really flustered for a lap or two,” Tuntivate said. “I knew I wouldn’t run well if I let it get to my head. I took a few deep breaths and just settled in and tried to keep with the pace.”
The Wilmington, Del., native sat in third heading into the final stretch, but outpaced his competitors and accelerated in the final lap to win the contest.
In the 5K, Tuntivate was again challenged by Columbia senior Brian Zabilski who finished second in the 3K. Through maintaining a consistent pace, Tuntivate did not stay out in front for most of the race, and instead used the other people in front of him to maintain a consistent time with each lap.
“The mentality going into the 3k was trying to separate 1800 in and try to stay comfortable,” said Tuntivate. “For the 5k, it was about getting an early rhythm and staying with the pace.”
Tuntivate’s race plan— predicated on consistency and rhythm— ultimately helped the senior distance runner conclude his indoor track career with two exhilarating victories in the biggest meet of the season.
HARVARD DOMINATES WOMEN’S 60M DASH
The brooms were out for the women’s 60 meter dash as Harvard had the top-four fastest times. The Crimson gained 28 of their points from this one event.
Although senior sprinter Ngozi Musa finished slower than freshman standout Kelisa Cain in the prelims, Musa rebounded and won the finals with a time of 7.42 seconds. Following the Seattle, Wash., native in the race were Olivia Okoli, Cain, and DaLoria Boone, respectively. This marked the first time at the Heps that the top-four spots were claimed by one school.
“I think it was about concentrating on my lane and my race and how I was going to execute,” Musa said. “I was talking to my coach beforehand about executing a great race and getting it done.”
CRIMSON SWEEPS MIDDLE DISTANCE MEN’S EVENTS
The 400, 500, and 800 meter events were all won by Harvard athletes this past weekend. Sophomore sprinters Jovahn Williamson and Rodney May-Agyare took home the title in the 400 and 500 meter race, while senior sprinter Myles Marshall defended his back-to-back heps title in the 800 meter race.
Williamson ran a blazing 47.53 in the 400m final, outlasting Penn’s Anthony Okolo by over a second. He finished over half a second faster compared to his result in his heat race.
May-Agyare had a more difficult time winning his 500m title as he just edged out Brown’s Calvin Perkins by .02 seconds. Going neck-to-neck across the finish line, May-Agyare had to dive across the line at the end to ensure victory for the Crimson.
Marshall cruised his way to an 800 meter title, with dominant races in both the prelims and the finals. With a time of 1:50 in the prelims, he outran the rest of the competition by three seconds. His 1:49 in the final outpaced Dartmouth’s Tim Zeph by over a second.
STRONG SHOWING IN HURDLES AND FIELD EVENTS
Junior triple jumper Simi Fajemisin had a strong showing in the triple jump, winning with a mark of 13.27m (43-6.50). She beat her previous record by six inches, and the second place finisher by almost a foot (9.75 inches). Famejisin was named the the Female Most Outstanding Field Performer.
On the men’s side, freshman jumper Kyle Murphy had two top-four finishes, securing a second-place spot in the long jump (7.48m) and a fourth-place finish in the triple jump (15.43m). Junior Donagh Mahon got first-place in the high jump (2.12m), beating Princeton’s Jeff Hollis. Senior Ian West just edged out Cornell freshman Johannes Stromhaug in the pole vault (5.05m) to earn fourth place.
The women’s hurdlers, junior Livia Gauntlett and freshman Jada Jones had personal-best races, obtaining a second and third place finish respectively. Gauntlett’s time of 8.42 seconds improved her own record by .02 seconds and moved her into third all-time in the Harvard record books, while Jones sits at fifth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Women’s Swimming and Diving (HWSD) defended their Ivy League title and took home records in the process. Over the weekend the Harvard Swimming and Diving team captured the lead early and never looked back, remaining in front from the first day to the fourth.
After a successful season in which Harvard Women’s Swimming and Diving went 7-2 overall and 7-1 within the Ivy League, last week’s Ivy League Championship was the perfect proving grounds for a talented Crimson team. Harvard suffered their only conference loss earlier this year against Yale (7-0) in a dual meet and has been hungry to have another shot. This time around, the Crimson secured the win, scoring 1,500 points to beat out second place Yale with 1,390.50.
The Harvard women got their shot this weekend and ran with it. HWSD swam their best in the most important meet of the season, tallying up points and records along the way. Senior tri-captain Valerie Yoshimura commented on the importance of team chemistry and cohesion in a sport many consider to be mainly individual:
“Swimming and Diving are largely considered individual sports. However, the women of HWSD approach challenges collaboratively, hold each other accountable in practice, and support one another outside of the pool," Yoshimura said. "The cohesion and love of this team enables us to overcome obstacles, compete with heart, and rise to incredible heights.’
These strong words embody how the Crimson team has worked throughout the season, capturing the highest prize in the process. The results speak for themselves. Within the incredible team accomplishments were many season bests and school records.
Day one of the Championship saw the team put together some of their most impressive individual efforts of the season. In the very first race of the day, Harvard set the tone be with Junior Mei Lynn Colby, sophomore Ingrid Wall, senior Brittany Usinger, and sophomore Kennidy Quist breaking the previous school record of 1:39.48, set in 2013 with a time of 1:39.34 in the 200 medley relay. This performance was not enough to win the race, but, beating the previous season’s best by three seconds was a good representation of what was to come.
“I am so proud of my team for winning Ivies for the second year in a row. It has been such an honor to be a part of the Ivy team for two years now. The 50 breaststroke is my specialty which is why I am always psyched to swim it on the 200 medley relay. This really was the first event of the meet, so it was awesome to start off on such a high note. I was so happy to contribute to the team and beat a historic school record,” commented sophomore Ingrid Wall on the opportunity to compete in the championship and beat a school record. “The team set our goals high and we performed very well throughout the whole meet.”
Later on in day one, the four-women team of junior Miki Dahlke, freshmen Samantha Shelton and Helena Moreno, and senior Sonia Wang defended their 800 free relay title from last year’s championship with a blistering time of 7:06.98, beating their season’s best by three seconds as well. This performance only trailed one race from last year, coming in second all time for the Crimson. Dahlke herself broke the school record in the first 200 of the relay with a time of 1:44.26, edging out her own previous record of 1:45.00 she set in 2018.
Day two saw more of the same for Harvard. Dahlke continued her dominant showing by winning the 500 freestyle with a pool and school record of 4:40.26. Helena Moreno finished third in the same race posting a quality time. Samantha Shelton turned in a personal best performance in the 200 medley with a time of 1:58.45, ranking third all time in the program and extending the Crimson streak of winning the event for five years in a row. Fellow Harvard swimmer Sonia Wang placed second in the 200 medley, giving Harvard the top two spots in the event. Mei Lynn Colby continued her strong performance by placing second in the 50 yard freestyle, breaking her PR with a time 22.52, and ranking second all time in Crimson history and qualifying for an NCAA B Standard.
Harvard also had three divers finish among the top six on the one meter board, with Senior Mikaela Thompson, Freshman Morgane Herculano, and senior Katie Russ finishing back to back to back in fourth, fifth, and sixth.
By the time the dust had cleared on day two, the Harvard women were in the lead with 526.50 points, 30 points clear of second place Yale who had been the only Ivy League team to defeat the Crimson in the regular season.
The last two days of the championship were the coming out party for the team. Dahlke won another race in the 100 butterfly. Shelton tasted victory again in the 200 freestyle, good for second best all time and proceeded to win again in the 200 backstroke, setting the Harvard and Ivy League Championship record with a time of 1:54.01. Dahlke, Colby, and Quist placed second, third, and fourth in the 100 freestyle with Dahlke breaking the school record.
While first year Marcella Ruppert-Gomez ranked second all time for the Crimson with her effort in the 1,600 freestyle. Harvard ended the night with their first victory in the 400 freestyle relay since 2008 with Colby, Shelton, Quist and Dahlke setting a pool and school record with a time of 3:15.47, just missing the qualifications for the NCAA A-Standard in the event. This final event was a fitting conclusion to the weekend, as the Crimson team, crushed school records on their way to incredible team achievement.
The Women’s Swimming and Diving team captured back to back titles for the first time since 1991-1992 proving the amount of hard work and effort this team put in throughout the year. Yoshimura echoed a strong team sentiment that proves the value of hardwork and team chemistry towards a successful season.
“It has been an incredible season,” said Yoshimura. “[we] have worked tremendously hard this entire year. Each athlete’s consistency and dedication to the sport and to each other enabled us to win the Ivy League Championship. Every single women on this team, whether she competed in the meet or not, played a critical role in our victory.”
To wrap up the individual awards, first-year Samantha Shelton shared the Ivy League High Point Award after winning three events, and senior tri-captain Mikaela Thompson won the Ivy League's Ron Keenhold Career High Point Diver award for her consistent performance over her career at Harvard.
Looking forward, the Harvard Women’s Swimming and Diving will be competing again in the NCAA Zone Diving Championships in Annapolis Maryland starting March 10. They will hope to carry the incredible momentum from this record-breaking performance forward throughout the final stretch of their season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since the 2005-06 season, Harvard tied both games in a single weekend, staging a comeback against Brown to equalize the Bears 3-3 and holding Yale to a 2-2 draw. The pair of ties more than a decade ago also came in February against Yale and Brown. Saturday’s Yale game marked the third consecutive game - and fourth time in the last five - that the Crimson has taken to overtime.
HARVARD 2, YALE 2 (OT)
After coming off a tie at Brown on Friday, Harvard traveled to New Haven to face age-old rival Yale. To open the second period, an offensive flurry saw the Crimson net one and the Bulldogs two, locking the score at two. 39:02 would elapse from the second Yale goal until the end of the overtime period, but neither team would find the back of the net again as the scoreline settled with a 2-2 draw.
Having  jumped out to a 5-0 against the Bulldogs the last time the two teams met, Harvard would look to start Saturday’s contest with the same intensity. The Crimson did, in fact, score first. Receiving a D-to-D pass from freshman defender Kyra Willoughby, senior defender Kaitlin Tse rifled a shot along the ice and towards the net front. On the puck’s path to the net, sophomore forward Becca Gilmore managed to deflect it past Yale senior goalie Kyra O’Brien.
Although the rest of the first did not see any more scoring, the first six minutes of the second featured 75% of the tallies on the day. Evening the game at one apiece, Bulldog junior defender Saroya Tinker converted off of passes from senior defender Julia Yetman and junior forward Sophie Veronneau.
Taking its final lead of the day, Harvard would strike again 4:36 into the middle frame. From the point, sophomore defender Emma Buckles launched the puck wide and off the end boards, but co-captain and forward Lexie Laing would opportunistically seize the loose puck for a centering pass to junior forward Kat Hughes, who made no mistake on the finish.
The Harvard lead, however, would only last for 1:22 as Yale would knot the game at two with Bulldog freshman defender Emma Seitz beating the Crimson freshman goalie Lindsay Reed. Little did the two teams know that scoring would be done for the day.
A large reason that the scoring subsided was indeed Reed, who turned away 37 of 39 shots on goal. Harvard only pieced together 16 shots on the frame, finding itself in a shot deficit in another game this year. Nonetheless, the offensive efficiency of scoring twice on just 16 shots while also staying penalty-free for the game could be building blocks for Harvard as it looks forward to its playoff matchup against the Colgate Raiders next weekend.
“We really wanted to come out with two wins as opposed to two ties, but going into playoffs, I think it was kind of a good reality check, and it shed some light on some things that we can really work on this week,” Hughes said. “Even though it’s unfortunate we didn’t come out with two wins, we learned a lot this weekend, and I think we’ll be able to translate against Colgate on Friday.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 3 (OT)
After shutting down Brown 4-0 earlier in the month, the Crimson trekked to Providence for its penultimate match of the season. The Bears would prove hungrier for points at home.
A flurry of action in the third defined what would be an overtime tie. Entering the final frame of regulation trailing 2-1 and coming off a period that saw Brown outshoot Harvard by 12-3, the Crimson needed a rapid response to emerge with points and secure a solid ECAC standing to enter the playoffs.
Twenty-two seconds into the third, Hughes delivered. Collecting a pass at the right side of the crease from Laing, Hughes went for the net, squeaking it by the goalie.
“Frustration is never the best thing, but I think we were a little disappointed with how we had been playing and how the game was going,” Hughes said. “After the second period, in the locker room when we were all talking, everybody made a conscious effort to do their best individually to turn it around, and as a team we were able to do so because of that.”
Less than a minute later, the Crimson struck again. After dropping the post-goal faceoff, Harvard regained control of the puck. Senior forward Bradley Fusco dished a puck to co-captain Kate Hallett, who put another in for the Crimson to give Harvard a brief 3-2 lead.
Then, for the third time in 1:56 of play, another goal - this time from the Bears. Senior forward Abby Niewchas captured her own rebound, bopping it in for a score to knot the game at three, the score at which it would remain.
The final five of regulation saw four power plays - another tie with two apiece - but no scoring, as both team’s penalty kill units went perfect on the night. For the second time in two games, the Crimson headed to overtime.
“We always talk about a defense-first mentality in that type of situation,” Hughes said. “Obviously, when the opportunity arises, we want to score and get the win, but it’s really important that our defense doesn’t pitch on the forecheck, and we always have a person high in the offensive zone.”
Harvard’s defense-oriented strategy worked, and the Crimson emerged with a point to continue with forward progress toward the playoffs.
The game had opened with a level of energy upstaged only by the third period’s start. After evenly-matched play for the first few minutes of the game, Harvard found Brown ice. Laing went to the faceoff circle and - as has been her modus operandi this season - won, sending the puck straight back to freshman defender Kyra Willoughby.
Crimson clustered around the crease, perfectly positioned to capture a rebound. There was no rebound necessary. A wicked Willoughby wrist-shot from the point zipped along the ice, through a lunging goalie, and into the back of the net for the freshman’s first collegiate goal.
Harvard dominated the remainder of the period, outshooting the Bears 13-6. Then, with 15 seconds left before heading to the locker room, a shot by Brown sophomore Kaitijane Blumberg bounced off junior goalie Beth Larcom. Junior Sena Hanson collected the puck and tapped it past with 12.7 seconds left on the clock.
The parity would continue. A diving save by Larcom eight minutes into the second, followed closely by a tumbling stop that nearly sent her into the net, would keep the line even. The Bears would score again to take the lead in the second before the Crimson responded with two of its own to open the third. The Bears tied it up just over a minute later.
One, two, two, one. The mirror image complete, no more goals were needed, and the game finished in a reflection.
Harvard returns to action on March 1 at No. 9/9 Colgate (21-8-5, 15-4-3 ECAC) for the ECAC Quarterfinals at 6 p.m. This marks the third time in four years that Harvard faces the Raiders in the ECAC Quarterfinals. The best-of-three series continues on March 2 and - if necessary - March 3. Harvard dropped both regular season games to Colgate, going down 1-0 in October and 4-2 in January.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael Lackey’s rise to prominence for Harvard men’s hockey has featured spells of inconsistency, long and tedious rehab, and an overall lack of stability. Having surmounted these obstacles to post a stellar senior season, the goaltender now faces some of these same challenges as he looks to recover from a lower-body injury sustained in the home stretch of the Crimson’s campaign.
Despite sturdy substitute performances from junior Cameron Gornet last weekend, Harvard will need a peak-form — and healthy — Michael Lackey in the crease to contend for a national title. Getting to know Lackey’s path to the present adds color to a relatively misunderstood Crimson hockey career, while also suggesting what the future may hold for the net-minder and his team with the postseason rapidly approaching.
FROM THEN TO NOW
While Lackey’s season as a whole has impressed, its start was far less glamorous. Harvard’s proclaimed starter attracted an abundance of critics after a rocky beginning to 2018-2019, allowing seven goals to Dartmouth in the season-opener. After being replaced by Gornet for the Crimson’s next game, he returned to the net against Princeton only to cede costly goals in a disappointing 4-4 tie. Combined with an inconsistent track record in past seasons, Lackey’s early struggles seemed to affirm skeptics’ concerns about his ability to carry his squad back to national relevance.
“The first game obviously didn’t go as planned, the tough game up at Dartmouth,” said volunteer goaltender coach Brian Robinson, who has worked closely with Lackey for several seasons and summers. “Usually, if you give up seven goals, you’re probably not getting the next start. So he knew. He was very accountable.”
Four months since that ill-fated start, the senior net-minder has shaken his doubters. His play is one of the main factors fueling the Crimson’s ascendency following a 2017-2018 campaign that underwhelmed in many ways. Even with his forgettable season debut, Lackey has logged a 14-6-3 record, good for a top-15 win percentage (67.4%) in the NCAA. His 2.23 goals against average and .920 save percentage both rank fifth in the ECAC, where Harvard now sits tied for second.
In 17 of his 24 appearances, the Washington, D.C., native has held the opposition to two or fewer scores, providing the high-powered offense in front of him — its 3.33 goals per game pace ranks eighth in the country — ample opportunity to win games. Moreover, Lackey has not given up more than three goals in a contest since his pair of lackluster starts at the season’s outset. In fact, he has been a top-10 goalie in college hockey since the draw with the Tigers on Nov. 3 (71.4 W%, 1.93 GAA, .931 SV%).
“Obviously it wasn’t the start that anyone wanted,” Lackey said. “I think mentally, I started to settle in and then just relax more, not get too worked up after giving up a goal and build confidence on top of that, use each game…as learning experiences.”
NEW YORK, NEW GOALIE
Following his first two starts, Lackey used serviceable performances against Yale (3 GA, .914 SV%) and Brown (2 GA, .920 SV%) to put his prior porousness firmly in the rear view. A subsequent up-and-down weekend against Arizona St. saw promising stretches from Lackey (1-1-0, 1.96 GAA, .929 SV%), but the Sun Devils’ overtime winner in game two of the series spoiled the Harvard tender’s night. Nonetheless, Lackey was continuing to hone the mental and physical qualities required of a go-to option in the crease.
“[Lackey is] really trusting his defensemen, he’s not cheating the play, not anticipating the pass and cheating away and giving up short-side goals,” Robinson said. “When you play like that — when you’re not giving up first-shot goals — I think it really helps a goalie just play with more confidence.”
Over Thanksgiving break, the Crimson tripped to Manhattan for a clash with storied rival Cornell under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden. There, on American sports’ grandest stage, a new Michael Lackey was born.
This wasn’t obvious from the opening puck drop, though. The Big Red potted an early goal and fed off the roaring Cornell-heavy crowd. In the past, Lackey may have lost confidence and strayed from his game for the remainder of the period, or even the contest. But this time was different. His body language told the whole story.
A composed Lackey continued to fight through screens, track incoming pucks, and play aggressive angles, stealing the show at the Frozen Apple. The Big Red’s opening score proved to be its sole tally of the night thanks to Lackey’s dazzling performance — and a timely one at that, in the midst of mounting criticism due to Harvard’s lackluster record.
“I think the game at MSG against Cornell was really kind of his coming-out party,” Robinson remarked. “Up until that point, that was definitely his best game he had played. I know after the ASU weekend…there was an article that absolutely ripped him apart.”
By the time the Crimson’s four-week holiday respite came around, Lackey had fully embraced the challenge of commanding the blue paint for Harvard, posting three solid starts (2-1-0, 1.35 GAA, .950 SV%) in early December.
As the 2019 portion of the schedule began, coach Donato’s group appeared to have answered its biggest remaining question mark. An experienced corps on the back end featuring one of college hockey’s best, junior Adam Fox, had learned to balance its offensive firepower with sound defensive play; a crop of skilled freshmen had helped fill the scoring void — and then some — left by 2018 Hobey Baker Award finalist Ryan Donato. And finally, as the club prepared for a second half containing ranked conference foes, the Beanpot Tournament, and the oft-intense home stretch of the regular season, it had a force between the pipes.
“The goaltending position is so important that if you’re having success or if you’re not having success, it coincides with the performance of the goalie,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think it took [Lackey] a little bit to get his feet underneath him and get really comfortable, but to me, he’s giving us the goaltending that gives us the chance to have success at the end of the season.”
ONCE STABLE, QUITE ABLE
A central theme, instability, defined Lackey’s path to becoming Harvard’s starting backstop. It was a chronic lack of routine — of the crucial ability for a goaltender to establish a rhythm — that resulted in so many misperceptions of Lackey ahead of, and in the early portion of, his senior season.
After just six outings as a freshman (1-4-1, 3.58 GAA, .876 SV%), Lackey endured double labrum surgery over the summer to address lingering hip pain dating back to his high school days. Comprehensive rehabilitation sidelined him for the entirety of his sophomore season. Meanwhile, the extremely deep and talented Crimson rattled off 16 straight victories en route to its first Frozen Four in 23 years, while then-junior Merrick Madsen ’18 established himself as one of the NCAA’s elite goaltenders (28-6-2, 2.11 GAA, .923 SV%).
As Madsen distanced himself on the depth chart and the team reached new heights in the Ted Donato era, all Lackey could do was watch.
“Your entire life, you’ve been a hockey player,” Lackey began. “You’ve been around the rink skating. It’s a battle looking for an identity at that point when you’re not practicing with the guys, you’re not going on the road with the guys. You’re just sitting in the training room during practice. So it sucked physically, but I think the hardest part was mentally.”
With Lackey back in full health the following season, competition with Madsen for the starting role would continue the motif of instability. After eight Madsen starts to kick off the campaign, Lackey was able to earn several of his own. Both net-minders displayed encouraging stretches, but at times both left something to be desired. So, the back-and-forth continued throughout the regular season, preventing Lackey from achieving any real constancy in net until this year.
“[Madsen’s] senior year, when I started playing, I was getting fired up,” Lackey recalled. “Especially the season before, where I had been watching the games and I had been seeing how well he was doing, I think it gave me confidence going in…that I’m competing with this guy who’s had one of the best careers a goalie has had at Harvard.”
It is truly no wonder that Lackey struggled in his first few appearances of 2018-2019. Until then, it had been five years, dating back to his U17 season with the U.S. National Team Development Program, since he was a team’s undisputed starter. After all, finding a groove — and one’s confidence — takes time.
“Obviously, Merrick established himself as a go-to guy for us, and then you add in the [hip] injury,” said coach Donato, recounting Lackey’s collegiate career. “It’s tough when the team is playing well two years ago, and the guy in front of you goes without a loss in [18] games. When [Lackey] had his injury, it was a tough spot. He’s out for a year, so now you haven’t played almost in two years of being ‘the guy,’ which has its own rhythm as opposed to just playing one game.”
NOT WHAT HE “KNEEDED”
Riding its goaltender, Harvard surged back into the national conversation, regaining its ranked status on Jan. 28 for the first time since dropping out of the USCHO top 20 in November of 2017. With a reliable net-minding situation, the Crimson continued to inch up the Pairwise big board — the indicator of a team’s at-large NCAA Tournament prospects — and looked like a squad that could threaten for conference and league titles in early spring. Then, the only force that appeared capable of slowing Lackey’s three-month-long roll entered the picture.
In the second period of Feb. 16’s battle with ranked ECAC foe Clarkson, Golden Knights forward Nico Sturm went bowling into Lackey’s legs after being hooked by a defending Fox. Sturm was slow to get up from the high-impact collision, and Lackey required an early exit from the game with an apparent lower-body injury.
The shock and uncertainty surrounding Lackey’s health severed any momentum gained from co-captain Michael Floodstrand’s game-tying goal seconds before the senior net-minder left the ice. Harvard would go on to lose, 5-3, but it was unclear whether a much greater loss than two conference points was looming.
Without public transparency regarding the severity of Lackey’s ailment, the Crimson’s ability to maintain its winning ways had suddenly become relatively vague. One thing was certain, however: the timing of the injury hardly could have been worse.
“I don’t think there’s ever a good time in the season to not be healthy, but this time of the year is probably even more frustrating,” coach Donato admitted. “Obviously, I want to be sensitive to the [injured] player. However, my focus is not how we feel about it. It’s about how we react to it and how we move forward in the short term.”
For those in and around the Harvard program, the ostensible knee injury against Clarkson especially raised concern, as they knew, unlike many, that Lackey underwent a knee procedure toward the end of this past offseason.
“I ended up having to get surgery late in the summer on a torn meniscus,” revealed Lackey. “So, for the last month of summer and for the first couple weeks of school, I was rehabbing that…. Looking back on it, I’m thankful that it happened during summer rather than during the season.”
Lackey’s optimistic words, uttered just days before his recent injury, were eerily ironic.
GORNET’S NET
With its starting backstop out of commission, the Crimson turned to its backup against Brown and Yale last weekend. Ahead of the significant ECAC homestand, Gornet was a relatively unknown quantity — the downside of Madsen’s and Lackey’s respective tears as the team’s number-ones. Gornet saw a single game’s worth of minutes in each of his first two seasons and ceded five goals in just his second career start back in early November’s trouncing by Quinnipiac.
“We have confidence in those guys,” said coach Donato of Lackey’s backups, Gornet and freshman Derek Schaedig. “But the truth of it is, they just haven’t had a lot of opportunity, probably somewhat similar to the same way [Lackey] didn’t have a lot of opportunity when Merrick was here.”
Nevertheless, Gornet posted arguably the most important performance of the Crimson’s season (2-0-0, 1.00 GAA, .969 SV%) over the weekend, making sure Lackey’s injury did not send Harvard into a downward spiral of uncertainty. Crucially, the St. Louis, Mo., product’s unwavering play may have alleviated some of the pressure on Lackey to return hastily from his injury.
While the program has not divulged Lackey’s status for the remainder of the season, a return at some point should not be ruled out. If Harvard clinches a top-four seed in the ECAC this weekend, it would earn a bye in the first round of the conference tournament, providing Lackey with an extra week to heal, if needed.
Assuming the Crimson’s season lasts long enough for Lackey to make his return, he will find himself in an all-too-familiar situation: needing to find consistency amid instability. If the emergence of Michael Lackey has proven anything this year, it’s that the senior will rise to the challenge.

If you’ve poked your head into a library this week or tried and failed to schedule a meal with a friend, then you’re well aware that midterms are afoot. Midterms cause members of the Harvard species retreat to their natural habitats (aka their favorite study spots), so what does your choice of study spot say about you?
Tatte/Starbucks
You’re writing new novel — congrats! Whether you’re a humanities concentrator writing a 100-page thesis or a STEM concentrator grinding out two (2) complete paragraphs, there’s something about the smell of overpriced coffee and saturated fat that’s sweet for writing.
Dorm Room
You’re working on a complicated assignment that demands your every brain cell (even the ones in the back singing “Mo Bamba”). You’re pretty used to working alone though, and rumor has it your suitemates haven’t seen you since you came back from break.
Library
Notebooks out, laptop charging, tears flowing — that desk at Lamont is all yours. You’re working on that final project that’s due in four hours, and need a non-distracting place. Aside from the occasional dramatic glare outside the window, there’s nothing that you can do in that drab wooden cubicle except for work.
Common room
You’re doing “work,” but the kind of work where it’s okay if you take four hours to do one question. Talking to people coming in and out of the building/room is your forte, and there’s nothing more refreshing then having some literal and figurative tea with friends after a long day.
Smith Campus Center
You’re doing light to medium work, something like a doable pset or readings for class. The Smith Campus Center’s confusing vibe (Were they going for minimalism? A plant aesthetic? But with the color orange?) isn’t the best place for thinking of ways to cure cancer, though. The unique chair choices are mainly ideal for lightweight reading, like “The Communist Manifesto.”
Wherever you choose to do your midterm studying, good luck securing a spot and make sure to bring a laptop charger. Welcome to the rest of the semester, folks.
