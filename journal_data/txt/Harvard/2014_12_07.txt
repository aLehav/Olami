After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMDEN, Conn.—The Harvard men’s ice hockey team enters the December break with a lead to defend.
Junior goaltender Steve Michalek made a career-high 43 saves as the No. 9/8 Crimson (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) defeated the No. 15/15 Quinnipiac Bobcats (10-5-1, 6-2-0), 5-2, at High Point Solutions Arena on Saturday. In its last game before the exam week recess, Harvard picked up its sixth straight win to tie Quinnipiac for first place in the ECAC conference standings.
“The power play made some good plays, and after that, I think we did some good things,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We won a lot of battles and footraces. It’s a nice way to finish off before the break.”
With time winding down in the second period and Harvard on the man advantage, sophomore center Sean Malone corralled a rebound off a slap shot from defenseman Patrick McNally and backhanded the puck around the left pad of Bobcats’ goaltender Michael Garteig as the buzzer sounded.
After review, officials determined that the puck crossed the line with 0.8 seconds left on the clock to give the Crimson a 3-1 lead heading into the final frame.
The goal capped a productive second period for the Harvard power play. Sophomore Phil Zielonka capitalized on a failed Quinnipiac clearing attempt to break a one-all tie at 12:03 in the second period, seconds after the Crimson’s second power play of the game expired.
After missing the first 10 games of the season to injury, Malone finished his first weekend back with two goals and two assists.
“We were obviously holding our breath waiting for [Malone] to come back,” Donato said. “He was pretty amazing for how well he played, for just being tossed in…. He really made some big plays for us and [gave] us another dynamic.”
Harvard is now waiting for the return of its other top sophomore center, Alex Kerfoot, who missed both games this weekend with an undisclosed injury.
The visitors carried the momentum from Malone’s goal into the final frame. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey lifted a drop pass from junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo to beat Garteig top-left at 4:23 in the period and extend the Crimson’s lead to three. The goal was Vesey’s team-leading ninth of the season and extended his point streak to 12 games.
Harvard got out to a quick start yet still looked shaky in the opening minutes.
Criscuolo netted the Crimson’s fastest goal of the season 16 seconds into the game, picking up a rebound off the first shot of the night from sophomore linemate Tyler Moy. Yet the Bobcats controlled the first period play from there, with junior forward Travis St. Denis scoring the equalizer less than two minutes after Criscuolo’s strike.
Steady goaltending and opportunistic special teams helped Harvard turn things around in the last two periods.
Gaining confidence as the game progressed, Michalek made one timely save after another, matching his career-high save total. He came up with his best stop midway through the third period, kicking aside a break away attempt from first line Quinnipiac forward Sam Anas.
“I think all of us have been a lot more consistent,” said Michalek of the Crimson’s quick start to the season. “We’ve really developed an identity; I think I’ve developed an identity. We have a ton of confidence in each other right now.”
Michalek’s season save percentage (.944) leads all Division I goaltenders that have appeared in 10 games or more.
The Crimson gained separation on the scoreboard by taking advantage of several Quinnipiac mistakes. The Bobcats took five penalties on the night, giving Harvard’s power play unit—ranked second in the nation—multiple opportunities to capitalize.
“We took some stupid penalties tonight, some in the offensive zone that we didn’t need to take,” Quinnipiac captain Matthew Peca said. “When [Harvard’s] power play is at 30 percent, you don’t want to be giving them chances.”
Junior forward Brian Hart added to the Crimson’s lead with an empty net goal at 18:37 in the third period. After sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson received a boarding penalty and a game misconduct for his role in a four-player skirmish at 19:15, Bobcats’ sophomore center Tommy Schutt tacked on a power play goal with six seconds left.
Paired with a 4-3 win at Princeton on Friday, Harvard completed its first road weekend sweep since January 2007. On Saturday, Donato could not remember the last time that the Crimson headed into exams atop the conference standings. The program has not won the ECAC regular-season championship since 1994.
Peca left the ice impressed with the visitors, whom he considers a possible top-five team.
“We noticed tonight that their work ethic is off the charts,” Peca said. “They have a lot of skill; they’ve always had a lot of talent…. But you can tell that they’re hungry this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team headed to Las Vegas, Nev. to take on some of the nation’s most elite competitors at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational. Last year, the Crimson fell jut short of reaching the podium, and the squad found itself in the exact same position when competition ended Saturday night.
“I don’t think we wrestled our best,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “This is a big tournament for us. It’s marked on our schedules as something to gear up for during the first semester, and I was hoping for us to do better. But there were takeaways.... Ironically, a lot of them came from our losses.”
The Cliff Keen Invitational is a staple of the Harvard wrestling season, with this year representing the Crimson’s 19th appearance at the Las Vegas Convention Center. Harvard vied for a solid showing against 38 of collegiate wrestling’s toughest squads, with 12 of the programs ranking in the top 20 nationally.
“It’s a great atmosphere,” senior David Ng said. “Everyone is really excited to compete and really excited to showcase how good they are. It’s always great to go out and wrestle a top ten guy and have the opportunity to knock him off.”
Ng was a top contender for the Crimson this weekend, snagging one of Harvard’s two top twelve finishes. The heavyweight found himself facing the number one seed, NC State’s Nick Gwiazdowski, in his very first bout. After losing to Gwiazdowski, 11-2, Ng rebounded to claim his next three matches. The heavyweight’s streak ended with a defeat against Ohio State’s Nick Tavanello.
“David was right in there,” Weiss said. “He wrestled really tough and had the chance to wrestle the defending national champ, and that’s a great experience. He fell short of placing, which is unfortunate, but it was a great opportunity for him.”
For junior Todd Preston, his finish this weekend is identical to the performance he put on last year. For the second consecutive year, he fell to his opponent in the round of twelve, just missing a top six position.
“Todd just needs to wrestle to what he is capable of, because is a lot better than what he did this weekend, and he knows it,” Weiss said. “He needs to use this experience as a springboard to better himself. I know he’s going to do better in the future because of the way he didn’t wrestle this weekend.”
Preston, seeded eighth in the 141 weight class, found early success as he defeated his first two opponents. In his first match, Preston held Indiana’s Joseph Duca scoreless to take the bout, 1-0, and followed it up with a victory over Boise State’s Geo Martinez, 6-1.
After a third round loss by technical fall to the eventual weight class champion, Preston was unable to regain his footing and lost in the round of twelve to West Virginia’s Mike Morales, 6-3.
“It was a little disappointing for us both, just because we came so close to placing,” Ng said. “We both were focused, we were both excited, and were really hoping to make it into that top six.”
One of the Crimson’s most promising showings came from freshman Josef Johnson. After a win in his first match, the rookie faced off up with the Nebraska’s Robert Kokesh—the number two seed nationally in the 174 weight class—and suffered a 13-5 defeat.
“I think Joe really turned some heads this weekend,” Ng said. “He wrestled against the number two guy in the country, and he wasn’t giving up takedowns easily—he was actually getting takedowns of his own. He was being the tough, gritty wrestler that we all want to embody on the mat.”
Other wins on the tournament came from senior Ryan Osleeb and junior Josh Popple, each of whom went 1-2 on the weekend.
“We always want to wrestle at the level of our opponents, and that’s why we go to these tournaments,” Weiss said. “ The more competitive our opponents, the better we get. It’s great experience for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blodgett Pool has been friendly to the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team so far this season, as the squad went undefeated against its first three opponents in Cornell, Dartmouth, and Columbia. But this weekend, the Crimson ventured away from its home pool for the first time of the season as the swimmers and divers parted ways to compete in the Texas Invitational and UGA Invitational respectively.
The meets gave Harvard a chance to test its skills against national opponents, and it certainly proved to be a worthy competitor.
The Crimson faced off against some of the toughest competition it will see all season, battling some of the top nationally ranked teams in the University of Texas, Arizona, and University of Southern California.
“I thought we held our own against them,” co-captain Mike Gaudiani said. “We had some phenomenally fast swims, which goes to show that we stood up and faced the competition.”
The three-day meet style also most closely resembles the format of the Ivy Championship meet at the end of the season, giving the younger members of the team a chance to gain experience in the longer meets.
“We actually prepare for about one or two weeks and kind of rest for a bit, so we are more mentally prepared for this meet and more rested” sophomore Eric Ronda said. “It’s really crucial to warm down and warm up as well as what you do in between sessions and during the nights because you are swimming so many runs on so many different days.”
Ronda continued his first rate performances in the 200-yard breaststroke, as he finished in fourth with a time of 1:55.71. Ronda is undefeated this season in the 200 breast in dual meets.
All weekend the Harvard swimmers showed off their depth as the team earned multiple NCAA B cut times on each of the three days of competition. The freshmen on the team played a big role in contributing to the squad’s depth and making an immediate impact in their first season with the Crimson.
Freshman Shane McNamara led the pack for the rookies, taking 15th place in the 100 breaststroke on the second day of competition and a seventh place finish in the 200 breast on day three. Ronda beat out McNamara by just under a second to finish with a time of 54.74 in the 100 breaststroke.
Fellow freshman Steven Tan also had a strong weekend, notching fifth place in the 400-medley relay and finishing just short of a B cut time in the 50-yard freestyle. Tan also claimed 11th in the 100-yard butterfly to add to his weekend totals.
Harvard’s depth continued to shine through in the relay events.  The team of sophomore Jack Manchester, Ronda, Tan, and co-captain Griffin Schumacher took fifth in the 400-yard medley relay. A second quartet of sophomore Aly Abdel Khalik, Schumacher, freshman Jack Boyd, and senior Spenser Goodman placed fifth overall in the 800-yard freestyle relay with a time of 6:32.39.
Overall, Crimson racers were pleased with the outcome of the event and gained confidence going forward as the team continues to face tough opponents.
“For the rest of the season, it gives us a benchmark,” Gaudiani said. “A lot of the guys at that meet are going to be top finalists at NCAAs, so it gives us some exposure to some extraordinarily fast national competition, which I think sets the bar high and gives us something to train for.”
On the boards, freshman David Pfeifer added to the rookie success by topping all Crimson divers with a 10th place finish in the one-meter contest. Senior George Doran and sophomore Manasseh Oso also had strong dives, both ranking in the top 16 of the one-meter competition.
Harvard has more than a month off before heading south to compete against Duke and South Carolina on Jan. 10.
“These next weeks are really crucial, “ Ronda said. “We are putting in hard work for the last big push before our tapers at Ivy Championships and HYP.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a long respite from collegiate fencing finally over, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams kicked off their respective seasons with solid performances. After posting a 16-4 record in 2013-2014 and taking fifth at the NCAA National Championships, the women notched their 35th straight victory at the Malkin Athletic Center against Tufts on Friday.
Led by senior Emma Vaggo’s 15-0 bout record on the day, the Crimson women (6-0) continued their undefeated season with five more wins at the Tradition Tournament on Sunday in Fairfield, Conn.
On different strips, the Harvard men (3-1) brought home three team victories despite competing a man down in the épeé division. In his first appearance representing the Crimson, freshman Eli Dershwitz notched a perfect 12-0 record against the sabré competition.
HARVARD MEN’S FENCING
As the Harvard men’s team found itself competing with only two fencers in épeé, the Crimson started each match by forfeiting three bouts in each first-to-14 contest.
Even so, Harvard fought its way to a respectable 3-1 finish for the tournament, including three straight wins over Princeton, Vassar, and New York University after losing to Penn State in the first match of the day.
“We were one man down, so the score doesn’t really reflect it as well as I think it could, but we really came together and fenced our best,” Dershwitz said. “We just knew that it was going to be hard...but after Penn State, we fought really hard for the rest of the day and for the rest of the bouts.”
For Dershwitz, the sabre fencer from Sherborn, Mass., the college stage may not have been the most daunting one he has been on in the past year. Currently ranked the No. 1 junior and No. 4 senior fencer, Dershwitz also won a gold medal at the 2014 USA Fencing National Championships in Division I.
With the addition of Dershwitz and fellow sabre freshman Eric Zhao, the Harvard men’s team is poised to improve upon its 12-6 record and fifth place team finish at the 2014 NCAA National Team Tournament.
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING
Another season, another strong start for coach Peter Brand’s group of fencers, who swept the Tradition Tournament competition for the second straight year.
“Starting off the same way as last year is really encouraging,” sophomore foilist Liana Yamin said. “I think we went in with the same attitude [of] doing what we know to do—supporting each other and cheering each other on because that’s where we get our best fencing from.”
Going undefeated in her three bouts against Tufts got some momentum going for senior épeé fencer Emma Vaggo, who calmly picked up 15 more victories to continue her perfect season. Across the board, too, the Crimson had great days against the five other schools—host Sacred Heart, Temple, New York University, Penn State, and Vassar.
The win over the Nittany Lions was especially uplifting for Harvard, after the Crimson women saw Penn State lift the team trophy at the 2014 NCAA National Championships. With Sunday’s victory, Harvard has now taken three straight regular season head-to-head matchups and is catching up in the all-time matchup, which the Nittany Lions lead, 10-8, after this year’s defeat.
“We have quite a big rivalry with [Penn State], and it’s always great to be able to pull off a win as a team,” junior Aliya Itzkowitz said. “As a team, we maintained our focus throughout, and that was something I was trying to do too because it’s easy to lose focus for one bout.”
Regardless of the numerical implications of the day, the more intangible aspects of the sport are helping the Crimson in the win column early on in the season.
“Our squad worked really well together, feeding off each other’s energy,” Yamin said.
HARVARD WOMEN’S FENCING 25, TUFTS 2
After dusting off the lames for collegiate competition, the Crimson women rolled to a 25-2 win in Harvard’s 22nd straight victory over the Jumbos on Friday afternoon.
Six of the nine Crimson competitors posted indicators of plus-10 or better—including a plus-14 indicator from defending NCAA Individual Sabré National Champion sophomore Adrienne Jarocki and a plus-10 indicator from 2014 NCAA individual runner-up Itzkowitz.
With a year’s varsity experience under their belts, Yamin and fellow foilist Hali Nelson looked comfortable as they had little trouble finding the silver lames of whichever Tufts opponent squared off against them. Combined with freshman newcomer Hellary Zhang, the trio conceded only six total touches in nine first-to-five touch bouts, for a compiled bout score of 45-6.
In their only points of the day, the Jumbos managed to take two bouts in the épeé division but were behind, 7-2, at the end of the day in that weapon. Also in their first collegiate appearances, freshmen Claire Dinhut and Julie Park went 2-1 with plus-4 and plus-2 indicators, respectively.
“We had really strong performances from the freshmen in their first big meet,” Yamin said. “Hellary has been a great anchor for the team, and college fencing is a totally different animal from high school fencing, but she wasn’t fazed by that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into a Sunday matchup with Maine, the Harvard women’s basketball team (4-4) was a gambler’s delight.
In the first seven games of the season, the Crimson had followed a script of predictable unpredictability, following every win with a loss and vice versa.
This trend continued in Bangor, Maine. A few days after dispatching Massachusetts, Harvard fell prey to a cold-shooting first half and suffered a 65-46 defeat at the hands of the Black Bears (5-3).
“We need to change something within ourselves so that we can come out in the first half and play basketball like we know how to,” senior guard Ali Curtis said. “It’s all about heart and intensity, and we didn’t show that today. That’s what we have to bring.”
The reason for the Crimson’s loss could be traced to one eight-minute period and one Maine player.
For eight minutes of the second half, the Black Bears held Harvard scoreless. During this time, the score changed from a 10-10 deadlock to a 23-10 Maine lead.
In addition to clamping down defensively, the Black Bears made 56 percent of their first-half shots, with seven players knocking down a shot.
“They came out aggressive,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “We were on our heels and made stupid turnovers on offense that they capitalized on.”
When the Crimson trudged into the locker room at the break, Maine led, 31-15. The 16-point gap was the largest first-half deficit that Harvard had faced since its loss to No. 2 Notre Dame.
Overall, the Crimson shot 32 percent over the first half and recorded as many turnovers, 15, as points. Many of these giveaways came in the form of steals, as the Black Bears grabbed nine takeaways before the break.
“We were trying to force it inside to a fault,” Curtis said. “We needed to reverse the ball and use pass fakes and attack. We tried to thread the needle inside, and it got tipped every time.”
On the other side of the ball, Maine rode a huge afternoon from junior forward Liz Wood. Wood, who averages 15.1 points per game, finished with 25 points on nine-for-13 shooting. She also led the team with nine rebounds.
In the second half, Wood proved particularly important, as she recorded 16 points after the break. This total included a three-minute stretch when Wood warded off a Harvard rally by scoring nine consecutive points for the Black Bears.
Junior forward AnnMarie Healy and co-captain Erin McDonnell led the Crimson attack with 13 and 11 points, respectively.
Harvard started the second half on a 5-0 run that cut the deficit to 11 points and brought the team within arm’s length.
“We came out and knew that we needed to take risks and play more aggressively in order to stay in the ball game,” Curtis said. “We started taking chances defensively and making them feel uncomfortable.”
But in a theme that would repeat throughout the afternoon, Maine stemmed the damage with the combination of tight defense and Wood’s offensive play. Six minutes later, the Black Bears recaptured a 16-point lead.
“As a team, we were not able to combine our offensive scores with defensive stops,” junior forward AnnMarie Healy said. “They hit some very good shots and ran a very disciplined offense.”
The Crimson also began the first half with play that encouraged a burst of hope. Forty seconds into the game, McDonnell drilled a three-pointer to put Harvard up 3-2.
However, it was the last lead of the day for the Crimson. After falling behind 20-10 with six minutes left in the first half, Harvard would never get within single digits of Maine.
Despite trading baskets with the Black Bears to close out the game, the Crimson never came closer than 19 points to Maine’s lead.
“After the game in the locker room, we talked about how in these next few weeks everyone has to look in the mirror, identify [her] weakness, and then make a change, make it [a] strength,” Healy said. “It’s a tough loss, but we are tougher.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With about a minute remaining in the game on Saturday, the No. 10 Harvard women’s ice hockey team was left to defend its one-goal advantage against then-undefeated Quinnipiac on the penalty kill.
After pulling senior goaltender Chelsea Laden in one last effort to send the game into overtime, the Bobcats held a six-on-four edge for the final 64 seconds.
But the Crimson defense, anchored by junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, held off the Quinnipiac attack in the closing stages of the contest, going on to upset the No. 4 team in the nation, 2-1.
“We managed [the power play] really well, and that just gives us confidence for the future,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Under a minute put a lot of pressure on our kids but they weathered the storm and executed.”
The win closed a home pair for the Crimson (6-2-2, 5-1-1 ECAC) this weekend at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, as Harvard collected two conference victories over both the Bobcats (13-1-3, 6-1-2) and Princeton (6-7-1, 4-4-1).
HARVARD 2, QUINNIPIAC 1
Heading into its fourth contest of the season against a ranked opponent, Harvard entered Saturday confident after rattling off its third consecutive win against Princeton.
“We knew we were going to have a strong matchup and dogfight with Quinnipiac,” Stone said. “But it’s really about us playing our game, and we’ve been back at that for about a week and a half now doing a really good job of playing some Harvard hockey.”
A fast, aggressive, and offensive-minded Bobcats team put the Crimson in defensive mode at the start of the game. Quinnipiac struck first, as junior defenseman Lindsey West put the puck past Maschmeyer eight minutes into the first period.
Harvard picked up the pace after West’s goal, eventually outshooting Quinnipiac 22-15 over the contest. Just like the night before, the Crimson got on the board with a score in the final seconds of the first period.
On the team’s first power play of the game, senior forward Lyndsey Fry scored off an assist from junior forward Miye D’Oench. The goal was the first of the season for the senior and the third consecutive success for Harvard on the man advantage.
“I think it was a good momentum shift,” Fry said. “Being on a power play is a good momentum shift in general, and then to be able to put a goal in, especially towards the end of the period, I think helped get us going.”
The Crimson carried that momentum into the second period, holding Quinnipiac without a shot attempt for much of the frame.
The game would remain tied, however, until midway through the third period, when Harvard pulled ahead with a goal from freshman forward Haley Mullins, who redirected a shot on target from freshman forward Karly Heffernan.
Maschmeyer made 14 saves on the night, stopping scoring chances on several scrambles inside the crease in the last few minutes of the game with six Bobcats on the ice and her team down a man.
“We work a lot on our penalty kill,” Fry said. “We take a lot of pride in our penalty kill. We’re all about defense first…. Being big, blocking shots, getting them out of the zone—that’s huge for us.”
With the win, Harvard ends 2014 on a four-game win streak—a sharp turnaround from its previous four-game winless streak.
“We have a lot to work on,” Stone said. “We’re starting to work harder individually and collectively, and that’s paid dividends for us.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
The Crimson extended Princeton’s losing streak to six games on Friday night with a win over the Tigers. Sophomore Briana Laing recorded 27 saves in the shutout—her first of the season.
The first goal of the game came off Harvard’s sole power play of the night, as sophomore forward Sydney Daniels capitalized on the opportunity. Freshman forward Lexie Laing quickly got the puck up the ice to senior defenseman Sarah Edney, who then set up Daniels for the goal from a distance.
Entering the second period down a goal, the Tigers stepped up their offense. The Princeton attack rattled off 11 shots—seven more than it had in the first period. But the Crimson halted the Tigers’ momentum late in the second frame when sophomore defender Briana Mastel assisted on a goal from Heffernan to put the team up by two goals.
Princeton conceded another goal early in the third period, when junior forward Mary Parker nudged a shot past Princeton goaltender Kimberly Newell off a misdirected shot from junior defenseman Michelle Picard. The win marks Harvard’s second shutout of the season and its first in conference play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday morning served as the calm before the storm for Harvard’s track and field program. In their first meet of the season, the men’s and women’s teams kicked off their 2014-2015 indoor campaigns at the Boston University Opener. While the meet featured a limited number of Crimson athletes, it served as a good tune-up before the teams’ stretch of six January meets and the month of intense training preceding.
As a group, the two squads brought home four first place finishes—three individual and one relay.
On the women’s side, the sprinters turned in a handful of strong performances. The Crimson had three first place finishes along with eight top-five finishes. Harvard’s 4x400 meter relay team of sophomore Jade Miller and juniors Madison Hansen, Allison Morrison, and Christi Scott finished first with a time of 3 minutes, 50 seconds. Also victorious on the women’s side were senior Danielle Barbian, who took home the win in the 200-meter with a personal best time of 24:94, and junior Autumne Franklin, who captured the 60-meter hurdles with a 8:81 finish.
“I think that [the victories in the 4x400 and 200 are] really encouraging and motivating for the season ahead,” captain Erika Veidis said. “It shows that the team is in great shape and I think that’s an indicator that our team is very capable of performing the same as or exceeding our performance that we had last year.”
Sophomore Jackie Modesett and Hansen placed second and seventh, respectively, in the 60 hurdles. In the 300-meter dash, Franklin took second and Miller third, while Modesett, Scott, and captain Ashley Collinsworth finished sixth, seventh, and eighth, respectively, while running in the second heat. Barbian beat out Collinsworth by one one-hundredth of a second in the 60-meter dash as the duo placed second and third.
While the women’s team brought many of its veterans to the meet, the men’s team showed its youth by fielding a team filled with freshmen making their collegiate debuts.
“We have some outstanding freshman student-athletes that we’re extremely excited about,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “They bring a lot of accomplishments, accolades, and talent. But more importantly, I think there’s a certain swagger to the group. I think they really want to make their impact and they’re looking forward to continuing to put in the hard work.”
The rookies made an immediate impact, as the 300 dash saw Harvard claim seven of the top ten spots. With a time of 35:16, freshman Matthew Hurst edged out fellow first years Andrew Bolze, who finished second, Alexander Moore, who finished third, and Malcolm Johnson, who finished fifth. Classmates Tomoya Hasegawa and Jay Hebert finished seventh and ninth, respectively, while sophomore Alex Kirby rounded out the top 10.
In the 60 hurdles, Hebert placed second, Bolze third, and junior Mark Hill eighth. Freshman RJ Ammons and senior Ryan Meehan finished seventh and 13th, respectively, in the 3000-meter race.
“[Hurst and Bolze] have a lot of excitement coming in as freshmen,” captain Ben Glauser said. “They work very hard, they have great attitudes, and it’s exciting to see them competing against each other in practice, and that should carry through for the rest of the season.”
In the field events, the women’s team put six athletes in the top five of their respective events while the men had four top five finishers. In the long jump, Hansen placed second with a distance of 5.31 meters, a one-hundredth of a meter behind Boston University senior Tessa Runels, while Morrison and sophomore Haley Baker tied for third. In the high jump, senior Ann Giebelhaus took second at 1.67 meters after losing the tiebreaker to Dartmouth’s Kaitlin Whitehorn. Freshman Marlena Sabatino placed third in pole vault while junior Lexie Schachne tied for fourth.
On the men’s side, junior Spencer Lemons took third in the high jump while Hill finished fifth. Sophomore Andrew Roney and senior Mike Slovenski tied for fifth in pole vault to wrap up a day of strong performances for Harvard.
“I was really pleased, we had a limited squad out there,” Saretsky said. “Not all the events were represented, but those that were I thought competed really well.”
