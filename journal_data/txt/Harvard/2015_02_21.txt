After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts Superior Court judge on Friday did not issue a final decision on motions by Harvard and the state Attorney General’s office to dismiss a lawsuit suing the University to divest from fossil fuels.
Last November, seven University students filed an 11-page complaint claiming that Harvard’s investment in fossil fuel companies signifies “a breach of [Harvard’s] fiduciary and charitable duties as a public charity and nonprofit corporation.” The plaintiffs, who call themselves the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition and are all members of activist group Divest Harvard, also alleged that the University is mismanaging its endowment in “abnormally dangerous activities.”
In response, the University, whose tops leaders have repeatedly argued against divestment, filed a motion to dismiss the case. Martin F. Murphy and Jennifer A. Kirby filed the motion to dismiss, which was debated at Friday’s hearing in Suffolk County Superior Court, on behalf of Harvard Management Company—the body responsible for investing the $35.9 billion endowment—in December.
In the hearing, Murphy asserted that the lawsuit should not go forward on the grounds that the Attorney General has the exclusive standing to challenge Harvard’s investment of charitable funds in the state of Massachusetts, except in extreme circumstances he said are not present in this suit. He also argued that investment in fossil fuels is legal and that the plaintiff’s claim that Harvard invested in “abnormally dangerous activities” has no legal basis.
Another motion to dismiss the case, filed on behalf of former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and presented by Assistant Attorney General Brett J. Blank and Murphy at the hearing, asserted that the plaintiffs’ status as Harvard students does not give them the right to claim mismanagement of the institution’s endowment against its fiduciaries.
“Why should these plaintiffs make the decision?” Murphy argued Friday at the hearing. “[The University’s] duly-constituted leaders should be able to make the decision about how Harvard’s endowment should be invested.”
The plaintiffs, who represented themselves without a lawyer, maintained in court Friday that their lawsuit should not be dismissed. Harvard must divest on several grounds, they argued, claiming that the impact that fossil fuel investment has on global climate change is cause to sue for “tort,” a wrongful act that causes someone loss or harm.
At the end of the hearing, Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Paul Wilson said he would “take the matter to advisement,” or take extra time to consider the motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The student complainants, for their part, said they were optimistic for their case. “I feel like we definitely presented the case in the way we intended,” plaintiff and Harvard Law School student Joseph E. Hamilton said after the hearing. “We are optimistic [the judge] will rule in our favor.”
The lawsuit is part of Divest Harvard’s recent efforts to ratchet up pressure on the University to divest from fossil fuels. Last week, members of the activist group occupied Massachusetts Hall for 24 hours in protest of Harvard’s decision not to divest, and in conjunction with alumni, the group plans to host a weeklong sit-in protest in April.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 21, 2015, at 1:30 a.m.
CANTON, N.Y.—For St. Lawrence men’s ice hockey captain Gunnar Hughes, it’s all in the family.
His father, George Hughes ’79, knew a thing or two about scoring with Harvard sweaters on the ice, leading the Crimson in points in all four of his seasons as a star center under the tutelage of Bill Cleary ’56.
On Friday night, Gunnar carried on the family tradition, albeit in reverse. The senior netted two goals and added an assist as the No. 20/- Saints cruised to beat No. 14/13 Harvard, 5-1, at Appleton Arena.
“It’s always been fun to play against [Harvard],” said Hughes, who grew up in Boston going to Harvard hockey games. “I always get a little extra kick when I play against them. I love playing against that team.”
Three unanswered St. Lawrence goals between 10:14 and 14:34 in the second period proved to be the difference in a game that the hosts controlled from the start. From the opening faceoff, the Crimson (13-9-3, 9-7-3 ECAC) looked a step slower than the Saints (17-11-3, 13-5-1).
Harvard entered the weekend wary of a slow start. Just five weeks ago, Hughes jumpstarted a first period onslaught in a 5-1 win St. Lawrence at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center off a feed from junior linemate Tommy Thompson.
Yet on Friday, the Hughes and Thompson caught Harvard with a sense of déjà vu that ultimately reflected itself in the final score. After junior Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek (22 saves) scrambled to stop a flurry of Saints opportunities, Thompson connected with Hughes across the slot to beat Michalek blocker-side at 9:06 in the first for the game’s first goal.
Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo salvaged Harvard’s weak opening frame on a power play by batting a blast from the point by sophomore Tyler Moy out of the air and into the net with 14 seconds left in the period, yet the game's final two-thirds rewarded the Saints for their persistence.
Hughes scored his second of the game at 10:14 in the middle frame with a shot through traffic that deflected off the knee of a Harvard defender. Three minutes later, Hughes caught Harvard on a line change to create a rush with Thompson, who put back his own rebound for the insurance marker.
“We’re playing playoff hockey—that’s how we’re describing it,” Hughes said. “We’re playing our system, taking away pucks and taking away options off the wall.”
Second-line freshman winger Joe Sullivan provided the dagger a minute later off a cross from classmate Mike Marnell. Marnell scored St. Lawrence’s fifth at 6:59 in the third period.
Marnell’s strike prompted Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 to pull Michalek, who was one of the few bright spots for Harvard with a handful of acrobatic saves in the first half of the game. Junior goaltender Peter Traber (four saves) came in on relief for his first ice time this season.
“Steve battled hard and made some big saves,” Donato said. “[Pulling him] was more about trying to keep him fresh.”
For St. Lawrence, star freshman goaltender Kyle Hayton (25 saves) was good but did not have to be great. Aside from a sprawling pad save by Hayton on a breakaway from sophomore center Alex Kerfoot, it was the Saints’ suffocating forecheck that carried the day, creating turnovers and limiting the visitors’ ability to generate opportunities off the rush.
“If you give [Harvard] time and space, they’ll make you pay,” St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel said. “I thought there were times we allowed that tonight…. But there wasn’t a lot of space for them tonight.”
With three games left in the regular season, the Saints sit second in the ECAC Hockey standings. Harvard is now fifth, one spot out of the place sufficient to clinch a first round bye in the conference tournament.

Dear lonely classmates of Harvard,
After a short hiatus, Listen Up! is back on Flyby, this time with wiser, older (freshman) columnists in the form of Caie and Will. We’re the first boy-and-girl team to take over the column. Undecided in whether or not we’ll venture through the snow for dinner at Annenberg tonight, undecided in concentration, and undecided in life, we are well-equipped to handle Harvard’s problems and are looking forward to knowing the intimate details of yours!
We know you’ve got questions that keep you up at night while you anxiously nibble away at Cinnamon Toasters, so please submit them here for some good ol’ problem solving. Did Datamatch fail to pair you with anyone? Do you need fashion advice for standing out in a sea of Bean Boots? Trying to figure out if doing long-distance from the river to the Quad is worth it? Tired of sending your roommate passive aggressive messages about keeping the room clean? Wondering how you can impress the girl of your dream without becoming “that Section Kid?” Send them in to us anonymously- we are here to help!
XOXO,Caie and Will

We at Flyby are obsessed with a lot of things, from Clover’s brussels sprout sandwich, Raven, to football players who hold The Bachelor viewing parties, but if there’s one thing we’re in love with the most right now, it’s love itself– that is, in the form of a list of 11 people we should be compatible with through the help of the Harvard Computer Society. Yep, we’re totally obsessed with Datamatch and that’s why we’re sending our editors on Datamatch dates with their top matches. We’ll be blogging about the trials and tribulations of modern day love, blind date joys and woes, and what that 93.28% compatibility translates to in real life. And if you’re feeling some serious #fomo after reading about our dates, why don’t you just press the inviting “Waffle me” button and take a chance?
In our first date in the series, I went on a Zinneken’s date with my top match, Nick M. Sertl ‘18. We spent an hour talking over some free tea and a chocolate waffle, and here are some top reasons why I enjoyed my date and therefore you should ask your own top match to go on that waffle date.
1) Nick and I had many Harvard-centric similarities that obviously meant we were compatible, i.e. we both did switch-service FOP trips and we both have around 11 hours of class per week.When Nick told me that he did FOP and then that he also went on a switch-service trip, I knew that the stars were aligned because we both spent our week before college trimming thorny bushes and creating trails, and so we were both one with nature. But then, when he told me that he has very little class-time this semester, 11 hours per week to be exact, and I counted up and had 11.5, I deduced that we basically have the same lifestyle. And to top it off, he also doesn’t like the Quad, Lamont, and Friday morning classes, so we’re #fated.
2) I got some free tea that lasted me through four refills for the response paper I had to write after my date.After you bashfully tell the Zinneken’s employee that you’re here on a Datamatch date (they will smile at you the way your parents smiled at you when you went on your first date in middle school) and read them your code, they offer you a free waffle with toppings and also a drink for each person! Thanks to that, I got some green tea that kept me *zen* throughout the date and also caffeinated throughout the early hours of the night to reflect on my great date and finish my paper on Roman history (but mostly to finish my paper on Roman history).
3) My friends thought I was being super courageous asking my Datamatch to go on a date with me and I basked in the glory of that.Tbh I used the excuse of journalism to conjure up the courage to go on this date, but I reaped the benefits of being brave amongst my friends nonetheless. My blockmates kept asking me how it went when they saw me afterwards, and some even thought of clicking that tempting “Waffle me” button themselves. To top it all off, some of my friends who unknowingly came to buy late-night smoothies at Zinneken’s saw me on my Datamatch date and probably thought I was super cool, fun, and bold (okay maybe not, but let’s pretend that’s what they thought).
4) Nick and I bonded over the fact that while we love Zinneken’s, we also just love microwavable Eggo’s and that is a solid enough reason to develop a blossoming friendship with occasional email correspondence.Zinneken’s was great (s/o to them for having us!), but when Nick admitted that he also loved Eggo’s, I was relieved because I do too. That led to us realizing we actually had a lot in common, such as mishaps with raw vegan food, drunkenly losing your phone and then finding it again, and long family car-rides to the Niagara Falls (we both agreed that the Canadian side is 3920290x better). I’m going to assume that this means we are on our way to the start of a great new friendship, especially because at the end of our date, Nick agreed to be in email correspondence with me (and by that I mean I asked if it was okay for me to email him this article when I’m done and he said yes).
Buuut, enough about my rambling. Here’s the final verdict on our date (note: there was absolutely no semblance of persuading Nick into answering a certain way for this question that would present me in a more flattering light):Me: The date was low-key, casual, and fun, so I’d be down for another one because we both have around 11 hours of class per week, can’t swim for our lives, and love microwavable Eggo’s so yeah.
Nick: Dates are good, but you know what I like better? Waffles. Preferably on top of waffles. So if waffles are involved, you can count me in. Data match, I might not have found love at first sight, but we had a lot in common and for that I thank you. By the way allergies to organic food are real.
But in all seriousness the date was great and it was nice to get to know Hyemi. It was way less awkward than I expected and I would definitely recommend the experience (and the waffles!) to everyone else.

It would be an understatement to say that the Crimson has not paid a significant amount of attention to recent campus sensation Datamatch. It’s like Tinder, but more socially acceptable! And less awkward! Is this algorithm the solution to the supposed lack of dating culture on campus? For our second date in Flyby’s Datamatch series, I went on my date and took precise notes to find out. Here is the chronicle of my Datamatch experience:
Monday, February 16: 2:43 p.m.As I looked down the list, my heart began to palpitate, my hands quickly becoming clammy and sticky. This is so weird. I know people on this list, but I don’t really like any of those people, to be honest. Was this whole Datamatch thing a sham? I mean, I knew I would never go on a date with anyone on my list (except for you, Nian my fellow Flyby exec, you are super cool). I had placed so much of my confidence in Datamatch’s robust and scientific questions, but I knew I would never be able to even hold a normal conversation with that strange girl in my section who now is, supposedly, my number three match.
Monday, February 16: 7:28 p.m.While going over our lists of matches with a close friend of mine, she points out that she knows my number one match, Karen Maldonado ’18. I know nothing about her, but after stalking her on the Harvard College Facebook, I learn that she is a freshman. My good friend then informs me that if I so desire, she would ask Karen to accept my waffle request.
What if she doesn’t accept my request? What if she equally stalks me on Facebook and sees my hilariously bad profile picture? Will she think I’m one of those strange kids that goes to Lamont Cafe to actually do work instead of pretending to do work?
Monday, February 16, 8:15 p.m.She has accepted my date request. Game on.
Tuesday, February 17, 10:18 a.m.Trying to be as inconspicuous as possible during my 10 a.m. lecture (I sit in the first row normally), I Facebook message Karen, sending a cheeky blurb asking her to Zinneken's. Details are exchanged, logistics ironed out, and the date is set: Thursday night.


Thursday, February 19 6:08 p.m.I arrive at Karen’s dorm, just in time. Not too early, but just a minute after Harvard Time expires, so not too late. So far, my date is going amazingly well. If the rest of my date is even one-tenth as amazing as my timing, then I am in great shape.
I introduce myself as Nacho and surprisingly, Karen remains completely unfazed as to why I do not call myself Ignacio. Does she know that “My actual name is Ignacio, but Nacho is a very common hispanic nickname for Ignacio’,” or do I have to repeat that phrase for her like I do to everyone? We then we start to trek across what feels like the entire expanse of Antarctica in the dead of winter.
Thursday, February 19 6:15 p.m.We arrive at Zinneken’s and place our order. I try to pronounce “café au lait” in a French accent to sound more cultured, but fail miserably, despite me actually taking a French class.
Our nutella banana waffle arrives, but Zinneken’s only has one knife on offer for us. Is this because Zinneken’s can’t afford more knives, or was this a scheme to make our date more romantic?
Thursday, February 19 6:18 p.m.Karen and I can finally sit down and start talking. I learned some interesting things about her. She really likes American Horror Story. Is that a good sign? Should I be mortified? From there on, our conversation actually got really deep. We talked about Latino/a identity, how college is different from where we are respectively from, social norms, and all that good stuff.
Thursday, February 19 6:57 p.m.We leave our good friends at Zinneken’s and head back to the Yard. All in all, I would say it was a good date. I managed to not spill anything on myself, and I think I did a good job of making Karen think I was interesting.
Also, to whomever I was number one on their list, you missed out on a great opportunity to meet me and pretend to laugh at my jokes. Your loss.
