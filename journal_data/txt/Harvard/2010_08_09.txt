After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SANTIAGO, Chile—History is a controversial issue in Chile. Twenty years after dictator Augusto Pinochet stepped down from “the presidency,” activists and judges are still trying to seek justice for the crimes committed during his regime. At the same time, current President Sebastián Piñera has publicly declared that “sometimes, it is best to let history sleep in peace,” calling on Chileans to focus on the future instead of dwelling on the past.
As someone who will eventually graduate with the word “history” stamped on her diploma, I naturally cringe at Piñera’s suggestion. But the more I learn about Chile, the more I see that it is in many ways trapped by its past, and that history can function as a barrier to progress.
In this fairly developed and modern country, divorce became legal only in 2004, and abortion is still illegal under any circumstance, even when the mother’s life is in danger. There is no abortion “debate” so to speak in Chile: the only thing that comes close is when politicians occasionally discuss the possibility of opening up “debate” on the issue. A complex web of history and culture keeps the topic of abortion (and other so-called moral issues) strictly out of the public discourse.
Under the deeply conservative and “pro-family” Pinochet government, women were mercilessly persecuted for trying to obtain abortions, and the fear and stigma that became associated with the procedure is still very strong. Many things have changed in Chile after the return to democracy, but abortion has remained a taboo subject.
The silence is partly due to the power and influence of the Catholic Church, which enjoys the unusual distinction of being allied with both the left and right political coalitions. During the dictatorship, the Church was an outspoken critic of the military junta’s human rights violations: Many individuals on the political left owe their lives directly or indirectly to the Church’s efforts. As a result, almost nobody wants to touch an issue that will certainly cause conflict with ecclesiastical authorities.
Chileans seem to confuse the Church of the past—which was a source of hope during a dark time, with the Church of today—which refuses to change its tune even though Chile’s repressive laws force thousands of women to seek abortions in clandestine, and sometimes terrifying, conditions. Botched abortions are believed to be the third leading cause of maternal mortality nationwide, an outcome that affects poor women—who cannot afford to have the procedure done in a safe and sanitary environment—in disproportionate numbers.
President Piñera and I probably don’t agree on many things—a woman’s right to choose, for one—but I think he was right when he said in an interview with ABC that “it is unfortunate when the past becomes an obstacle for the future.”
It is important not to forget the past—neither the crimes of Pinochistas nor religious leaders’ bravery in the face of them—but letting old loyalties and antagonisms dominate current policymaking is a serious error. I can only hope that one day, Chile will figure out how to face its history without becoming prisoner to it.

RIVER EDGE, NJ—I won’t lie to you, my teeth aren’t white. They’re more of a weak, noncommittal yellow. But brown? They’re definitely not brown. Nevertheless—in early July, gritting my teeth in a pizzeria’s bathroom mirror—brown is what I saw.
Wiping the tooth in question with a square of toilet paper made no difference, neither did gargling with tap water. Aghast, I did what I always do when confronted with a tragedy of unfathomable proportions: I called my mother.
“Honey, no one will notice. It’s a molar, right?”
It was hardly a molar. It was impossible to miss—the tooth between my left front tooth and canine, where a fang might descend in a less-orthodox vampire canon like True Blood.
“I don’t know,” she sighed. “You might need a root canal.”
Well, shit. This struck me as both deeply unfair and inevitable. I’ve had awful luck with my teeth: first, a retainer, four adult teeth pulled at 12, and then six years of braces. (You’d think six years is long enough to get used to anything, but I spent my adolescence smiling with my mouth closed for photographs.) But in fairness, I’m not just a victim of circumstance. I drink coffee, tea, Diet Coke—anything that doesn’t dissolve the glass it’s served in. I’ll remember to floss when it’s required by law.
Two weeks later, I watched as a dental hygienist illuminated my X-rays.
I exhaled. “That can’t be good.”
“You know how to read X-rays?” she asked, genuinely curious.
I don’t have a medical degree, but the dark rift between my tooth and gum wasn’t hard to interpret. The dentist came in and eyed it warily.
“Was that tooth ever hit by something? A softball?” Never.
He looked back at the X-ray and frowned. “A rock?”
My root canal was scheduled for the next Saturday morning. In the interim, I made the mistake of searching Google for images of the procedure (never do this) and read all that I could about it (really, never). The basics: drill down to the nerve, drain the pulp, leave the tooth for dead. A relaxing start to any weekend.
By the time I took a seat in the waiting room, I was seriously considering calling it a loss and investing in a set of well-made dentures. The TV was tuned to the Food Network—an ironic choice, given my increasingly firm belief that I would never chew again.
Then, horror of horrors, I found myself reclining in the dentist’s chair, silently loathing the phantom softball that brought me there. My fingernails dug into the vinyl, a flip-flop dangled precariously off my twitching right foot, and when the drill finally made contact, I felt...nothing. Nothing. The sweetest nothing of my life. Even the pinch of the initial anesthetic injection had been preceded by a Q-tip dabbed in some wondrous, numbing goop.
In fact, the only jarring moment came at the root canal’s end, when the tooth was cauterized. “It’s going to get a little smoky,” the doctor told me, which is not #1 on my list of favorite things to hear about my mouth. But seconds later, I was happy he said something—the white wisps of smoke drifting in front of my nose would have been a lot more disconcerting without warning.
I left the office with a post-anesthetic slobber, a prescription for antibiotics, and a new, braver tooth.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—The urban wallpaper of Latin America is political graffiti.
Graffiti covers the majority of plain walls, garage doors, sidewalks, and even a few grandiose public statues in both the cities and small towns I visited this summer across various countries of Latin America. The graffiti extends from the grittiest slums I visited, where homes consist of chicken wire covered with trash bags, to the highest income neighborhoods in Argentina, such as Recoleta in Buenos Aires. And apart from the occasional tagger who crafts indisputable works of art, holds a singular infatuation with his name, or loves words that in English begin with A, B, C, F, and S, most of Latin American graffiti exults politicized messages.
Messages from political groups of all stripes compose the dyes of this wallpaper. Mainstream campaigns, like the current president of Argentina, have some of the largest messages. “Long live the Kirchners!” declares one message by train tracks near Tigre, Argentina where each multi-colored letter stands taller than my body. One candidate is ready for the 2011 elections with amazing name recognition; “Pacha 2011” scream the template-drawn messages that are mosaicked across walls in La Plata, Argentina such that, without exaggeration, nearly one out of five street corners in the city center plug the campaign. Nonetheless, not a single local I asked knew for sure who Pacha is or even what office he (or she) is running for.
Beyond candidates, special interest groups like the vegans have taken their aim at public opinion. In capital letters, I found the message “Milk=Torture, Meat=Murder” in Spanish and capital letters, like all the other messages, on a wall besides The National University of La Plata. And I can only imagine what cutting hot breakfast would have been like at this university; earlier, I read messages on a nearby wall objecting to the purportedly low nutritive content in medical students’ dining hall meals as I watched student protesters holding similarly-worded signs blockade the adjacent road with stacked desks.
However, alongside the groups with more entertaining, creative messages, some graffiti seems to carry genuine sentiments of distress from people feeling neglected by their political leadership and the justice system. One of the most common of the more personal and passionate messages—and some of the largest and most elaborate graffiti displays that I saw across much of Argentina—stems from the families of los desaparecidos, the political victims of torture and murder by military dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s. On sidewalks surrounding a number of law schools in Buenos Aires, I found cries for justice and pleas that the nation not forget the extensive political cleansings of decades past.
Related to another mass-murder, in the central plaza in Bariloche, Argentina, hundreds of spray-painted white bonnets adorn the ground along with victims’ names printed alongside a number of the emblems. Along with the curt charge, “GENOCIDE,” the logos also peppered the plaza’s statue of General Julio Argentino Roca, who some associate with forced expulsions of indigenous populations in early 20th century Argentina.
It is hard to translate the proliferation of these public political expressions to deep insight on the political behaviors of regular Latin Americans. Despite the graffiti and reputations of mass protests in large public plazas, many of the Argentines I spoke with across various age groups expressed a general sense of disillusionment from the current political parties. Many hesitate to wade too deeply into political activism after military dictators three decades ago meticulously quashed dissent from local universities, often through murder. Nonetheless, remaining exposed for months or longer between coats of fresh paint, these messages have become part of the urban art.

PARIS, France—The other day I asked you what you thought of the burqa in France. A woman wearing a niqab had walked by, we were stopped at a traffic light, and I’d wanted to practice my French.
You were clearly agitated. You started gesticulating at the woman walking by, and you spoke heatedly about her. When you saw what must have been the puzzled look on my face, you gave me the disclaimer that you were an Iraqi Muslim yourself and therefore understood Muslim culture much better than most. Fair enough. But then you said that, as a French citizen, the primary reason you supported the burqa ban is that the burqa is the “subjugation of women, no two ways about it.” And in France, I think you added, women are simply not subjugated.
I’m not so sure about that, either in France or in the West at large.
If you’d looked at the other women walking down the Boulevard St. Germain that day, you would have seen what I saw—a host of female bodies squeezed into uncomfortably tight jeans and sky-high stilettos. True, no veil covered the faces on those bodies, and they were visible for all to see. But, as many of those faces were painted with makeup and enhanced with various cosmetic improvements, can you actually call them the faces of the free?
I would echo what Martha Nussbaum wrote just two days before the French lower house voted 335 to one to ban any face-covering veil in a country that prides itself on progressivism: “Every time I undress in the locker room of my gym, I see women bearing the scars of liposuction, tummy tucks, breast implants,” she said. “Isn’t much of this done in order to conform to a male norm of female beauty that casts women as sex objects?”
But, you said, no woman would choose to wear a burqa if she actually had the ability to choose. In my mind, if it’s really the “subjugation of women” you care so much about, you should also concern yourself with that huge percentage of non-Muslim French (and Western) women who are themselves subjected to an ideal of beauty articulated and enforced by men, one that you should oppose with equal vehemence. You, however, seem to care only about the burqa and not about the Botox.
This, ultimately, is the part of your thinking that is most deeply troubling. You hold a different standard to two groups of women—the so-called “liberated” French women with cosmetic surgery on the one hand and the (very small number of) Muslim women who opt to observe tradition on the other. In other words, it seems as though it isn’t the “subjugation” of these burqa-wearing women that you really care about—it’s their difference, their “otherness.”
You said you were a Muslim yourself, and—I must admit—I’m a bit surprised that you don’t seem to dismiss out of hand the viewpoint that has for so long marginalized minorities like yourself in nation-states like France. Also, it seems a bit upsetting that, as someone with a worldview much broader than the narrow confines of modern French society, you nevertheless accept automatically the current French nationalism that, in the words of former Harvard professor Judith Surkis, “upholds woman’s bodily dignity as a core value and ideal, but only at the expense of women’s volition, agency, and legal rights.” Not to mention the inherent xenophobia involved in policing the “bodily dignity” of only one group of women.
I wish I’d had the words to disagree in person.

A fan favorite, women’s volleyball player Anne Carroll Ingersoll knows how to excite spectators with earth-shaking spikes and back-breaking blocks, eliciting cheers of “IN-GER-SOLL” from the crowd. But that is far from the craziest thing Ingersoll has heard a fan yell, as she reveals in this exclusive interview. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
 Name: Anne Carroll Ingersoll
 Year: 2012
 Position: Middle Blocker/Outside Hitter
 Stats: After winning Ivy League Rookie of the Year as a freshman, Ingersoll led the Crimson as a sophomore in total blocks with 92 and finished second in total kills with 233. Ingersoll also managed to finish sixth in the Ancient Eight in hitting percentage, with an efficiency of 29.8-percent.
Interrogation time.
1.Typical pre-game meal.
My meal always consists of a bowl of Cocoa Rice Krispies. Always. The way they turn the milk chocolaty is magical and makes me believe that anything is possible.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I get pretty attached to the pre-game warmup CD our team puts together every season. Last year my favorites were "Replay" by Iyaz and Miley Cyrus' "Party in the USA"
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
Yale, because it's always personal.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
I'm not sure I understand the question. Why would someone think that anything "ridiculous" has ever happened in the volleyball team's locker room? We just happen to spend a lot of our time there...
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
I don't get embarrassed very easily on the court. Or maybe I just decide to block those moments out. I do tend to trip over myself a lot or fall unnecessarily which is always awkward.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
My teammates say that I am a seahorse. I wasn't sure what that meant concerning my style of play so I wikipedia'd it. Turns out they swim "very poorly," so I really hope my teammates aren't trying to tell me something.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
I have gotten pretty good at tuning fans out, but freshman year there was this guy at our tournament in Florida who kept threatening to cut my ponytail off. That was kind of weird.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I don't think I could ever leave the MAC (which is definitely my second home while I am at school) so I guess that narrows it down to either fencing or wrestling...
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
I would definitely be a beater. They exist to smash balls at the other team while protecting their own team from opposing beaters. Not only does this sound awesome, but it is basically what I do in volleyball.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
I would go on a date with Shaun White. After a day of snowboarding, we could discuss being from San Diego and brainstorm how to keep gingers from going extinct over some California burritos.
