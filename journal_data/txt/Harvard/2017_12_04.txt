After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember this day rather vividly, in contrast to the blur that was freshman year. I can’t remember the exact day, but I only know it was a week night in October of my freshman year. As I often did around 10 p.m., I sat alone in my room in Canaday Hall grasping a bottle of some kind of alcohol, probably Crown Royal whiskey. I had a special attachment to Crown Royal. It was the first liquor I ever drank back in junior year of high school. I could still remember that distant time when I enjoyed the singe of liquor rushing down my throat, the sense of adventure and the fun. Now, it was isolating and depressing.
This one night in particular stands out in my mind for one major reason: suicide. I had often made jokes about suicide and about wanting to die, but they were mostly jokes. This night, however, was different. I had hit rock bottom a few times but this time I felt like I had found an even lower place. I made a connection between the night I was having and a night from a year before when I had a breakdown and found myself on the floor of my home, unable to do anything. My cat and three dogs had stayed by my side until I felt better. But now I was at Harvard. I had no pets to console me and I had no friends that I felt I could open up to on campus. It was just me alone in the room.
As I drank and wallowed, the question, “When did I become a ghost?”—Kid Cudi’s musical explorations of darkness—resonated with me. Music has always been an escape for as long as I could remember, and knowing that somebody else had gone through similar pain and hopelessness was comforting in a way. And on this one night when I, for the first time in my life, legitimately was considering suicide, the music kept me sane until I made a life changing decision: I reached out to a friend.
To be honest, I didn’t really know this “friend” very well. We had hung out maybe three times, but I decided to text her and ask if she was awake. She fortunately was and I found myself pouring out many of my thoughts and feelings even though I thought she would think I was nuts. I told her about how I always felt alone, how I felt out of place at Harvard, how I felt hopeless all the time. I told her I was considering transferring and my fear that nothing would get better in my life and that I would be haunted by the specter of depression for the rest of my life. For some reason, she wasn’t turned away by a breakdown from someone she barely knew. For this I will always be thankful, because I’m not sure if I’d be here today otherwise.
I remember getting a text from my mom that night as well. I don’t remember what the text was about but I remember how depressing it felt to be drunk and contemplating suicide while getting a text from someone who would be devastated by any actions taken. And so I continued texting my friend, repeating the same themes. Near the end of the conversation, I made a joke about suicide and she asked if I was being serious. I replied with something along the lines of “Haha, thanks for listening, I’m going to bed” and that was it.
The next day I was contacted by my proctor. I went to his room and after talking we set up an appointment with the mental health services. I then started seeing someone regularly and began down a long path to getting better. I suspected that my friend had had a part in this, and she later told me that she had been worried and talked to someone else who then emailed the Dean of Freshmen. That all got sent down the chain of command to my proctor. Her decision set in motion a series of events that has put me in a better place now than a year ago.
I am sharing this story because Harvard is a taxing place. You never know when someone may be struggling, especially during finals, an extremely stressful time in students’ lives. So please, reach out. Reach out if you are someone in need of help. There are people who care about you and who are more than willing to dedicate time to help you out. Reach out if you think someone may be struggling. If you haven’t heard from someone and suspect they may be having a rough time, talk to them and check in. Reach out to get proper help if someone comes to you with the thought of harming themselves. They may be upset at first, but there’s a good chance they will appreciate it later on and you just may save a life. I’m forever thankful for what my friend did for me that night. I may not be here today without her, and all it took was for the two of us to reach out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, it was announced that the 135th iteration of The Game, the historic football matchup between arch-rivals Harvard and Yale, will be played at Fenway Park rather than the Harvard Stadium. Though the venue of a football game may seem triflingly unimportant, the rich history that imbues the Harvard-Yale matchup gives weight to every single aspect of the tradition. After all, the Harvard Stadium is in the National Registry of Historic Places and it will be the first time in over a century that The Game is played in a venue other than the Yale Bowl or Harvard Stadium.
Though we accept that this move is set in stone, we still feel that its underlying rationale is somewhat confusing. The Harvard football team will play every other home game next season at the Harvard Stadium, but during The Game it will be inspected in design and engineering studies “to help inform future stadium improvements” to the end of increased accessibility, office space, and reparations. Though we wholeheartedly acknowledge the merit of these goals, we remain curious as to why the Athletics Department scheduled this assessment to coincide with the most important annual event that the stadium hosts. Additional clarification would help all attendants of The Game next year appreciate the rationale behind the move. Regardless, we commend them for booking a locally and nationally iconic venue; among all the options in the Greater Boston area, it is likely the most suited for The Game.
Nevertheless, now that the choice has been made, the Athletics Department and Harvard as a whole must cope with the logistical hurdles that the relocation will present. For one, many students look forward to the pregame tailgates in the ample lots that border Harvard Stadium. Downtown Boston is lamentably not nearly as conducive to this sort of activity. A possible solution would be for shuttles to be provided from the tailgating areas to Fenway Park—a mere three mile drive—so that students can have the same experience. However, as we have mentioned in the past, students can have trouble making it into into the stadium even when it is immediately next to the tailgate, so we are concerned that this move will only further suppress attendance.
Moreover, Harvard must not resort to cutting corners elsewhere—especially in matters of student safety and well-being—due to the additional logistical headaches and costs produced by the relocation of The Game, especially when Yale made an active effort to make The Game safer this year. For one, the offering of a substantial breakfast to both Harvard and Yale students would help to encourage safe drinking. Similarly, the expense of The Game should be kept constant for students.
Though there remain questions to be answered, we are as excited for The Game as any normal year. Indeed, no matter the venue, we are exhilarated by the prospect of a Harvard beatdown of Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Formerly known as the Kremlin on the Charles, Harvard’s developed itself quite the reputation as a veritable winter wonderland in the past few years. Housing legions of politically correct “snowflakes” (a modern pejorative for liberals) who frequently stand up for their beliefs, eschew hate speech, and ask for inclusive social spaces, undergraduates and staff alike have re-dyed the Harvard name in leftist blue—so much so that drawing red from this name now is inseparable from also drawing blood from it.
This isn’t only a trend along the Charles—it’s a national phenomenon. Higher education has been shown to increase liberal leanings overall. Harvard is one of many schools that champions this liberal arts education that provide the soundscape for these thoughts to reverberate, enclosing left rhetoric in the bubble as the only intellectual air to breath. Yet, the accumulation of “snowflake” ideas gives way to an avalanche effect: The more prominent and heavily liberal ideals that are expressed on campus, the more likely for more conservative views to be swallowed, suffocated in the deluge, and rendered invisible under the snow.
It is all too easy to fall prey to this isolation of political thought and the zeitgeist of liberalism in today’s political climate. Research has shown that people will go to exorbitant lengths to avoid cross-cutting conversations with people who have opposing political views—even as far as to lose out on a monetary gain just to not hear opinions that differ from their own. Providing facts may seem to be an easy way to avoid opinionated strife, but on either end of the spectrum it has shown to have only further entrenched people in their respective political beliefs.
And in a liberal arts school that promulgates leftist biases, it becomes easy for liberal students—myself included—to surround themselves with political thoughts they find comfort in and marginalize any other voices that chafe against their own political predilections. Free speech has been sharpened as the soapbox for extremists, so we rally against it. Then others rally against our rallying, and the ability to have a constructive dialogue with two opposing views is lost amid the game of “who’s voice is loudest”.
A recent New York Times article tried to tackle this issue of issue (though at a more extreme level than most Harvard political tiffs). In detailing the daily life of a self-proclaimed Nazi and white nationalist, the NYT intended to show how the “other side lives” by portraying the protagonists as an everyday kind of guy. The attempt went viral, and suffered from waves of backlash.
While humanizing Naziism surely wasn’t a sage move and their presentation of Nazi views should have been overwhelmingly less sympathetic, they were onto something with their overall intentions. Attempting to burst the liberal bubble and circulate a wider set of political views could help bridge the political divide and engender conversation between the two parties.
Fostering conversation between liberals and conservatives—especially on a campus like Harvard’s, where those who have conservative leanings can be hesitant to express themselves for fear of the social ramifications of their opinion—can only help both sides, especially during the politically tense period of history we are going through.
Developing a humanized foundation of the left and right on campus is key to starting this conversation. Beginning these talks with the mutual understanding of identity salience and the self affirmation of it has been shown to nurture open-mindedness and perceptual flexibility in polarized political discussions. Moreover, in continuing a dialogue where one explains their policy preferences, mechanistic explanations have shown to even moderate one’s political views.
On a campus where we liken inclusivity to the divine and where liberals are in a position of power in terms of sheer numbers, we must do our best to not shy away from political ideologies we do not agree with. This does not mean silencing our views; given the dangers of a Trump administration, keeping liberals quiet isn’t the answer. What it does mean is to provide a space for conflicting political ideas and to listen—honestly and open-mindedly—to the conservative friend from class, our roommate that dips their toes in libertarianism, or a familiar face that’s a part of the Dems. In doing so, we can lessen the onslaught of an avalanche, choosing to find beauty in the four seasons instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 4, 2017 at 12:16 a.m.
As the Federal Communications Commission prepares to vote on a proposal to dismantle current net neutrality rules, professors at Harvard Business School and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences cautioned against several aspects of the proposal.
Last month, the FCC released a new proposal that would remove previously standing rules that prohibit Internet service providers from blocking, slowing down, or charging different prices for access to different internet content. The FCC will vote on the proposal on December 14th.
James H. Waldo, a computer science professor and the chief technology officer at SEAS, explained that arguments against net neutrality have evolved since the concept's inception.
“It started off with the idea that the Internet providers like Comcast and Verizon could do differential pricing based on the content of the package that was being delivered, the idea being that things like video took a lot more bandwidth than other forms of Internet traffic,” Waldo said.
However, Waldo said this rationale has since largely morphed into a strategy for the economic benefit of Internet service providers.
“What this has now become is an attempt by the Internet service providers to be able to charge particular customers... different prices based on who are at the ends of the line,” he said.
Venkatesh Narayanamurti, a Professor of Technology and Public Policy at SEAS, said he believes Congress should pass legislation to deal with the issue of net neutrality because of the conflicting interests of Internet service providers, websites, and consumers.
“Verizon and AT&T, they obviously have one axe to grind. Then, the people like Netflix and Amazon have a different axe to grind. And then the consumers, you and I, have different needs,” Venkatesh said.
Shane M. Greenstein, a professor at the Business School, said most experts support the provision from prior administrations—both Democratic and Republican—that prohibits blocking and throttling, the practice of companies deliberately impairing content. The FCC’s current proposal would eliminate this provision.
“It is the FCC’s job to stop throttling, to stop firms from blocking other traffic,” Greenstein said.
Greenstein added that the dismantling of net neutrality is not likely to directly or immediately affect Harvard or other academic institutions, because most academic institutions receive Internet connection through “private companies or direct contracts.”
But according to Waldo, the dismantling of net neutrality will give Internet service providers the power to harm academic institutions, even if providers do not decide to use that power.
“I can see them, for example, deciding that they want to charge extra for courses that are being taught by HarvardX, and if that's the case, then we would probably have to discontinue such courses because we're not going to pay for courses that are offered for free,” Waldo said.  “It could have the same kind of effect on some of the things that are done by the Division of Continuing Education, which does a lot of its learning over the Internet.”
While Waldo said these possibilities are unlikely, he also said that the dismantling of net neutrality could lead to a wide array of unforeseen consequences.
“I doubt that they will get to the point of charging Harvard IP addresses differentially as consumers, but they might do that. The point is we have no idea what this could lead to,” he said.

Boston city officials, Harvard administrators, and Allston residents gathered together Wednesday to place the final beam on the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ new seven-story complex in Allston.
The ceremony marked the completion of SEAS complex’s steel framework, a project expected to cost more than $1 billion. University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh directed the placement of the final steel beam on the new structure.
Speakers at the ceremony included Francis J. Doyle III, dean of SEAS, the complex’s architect Stefan Behnisch, Vice Chair of the Board of Overseers’ Executive Committee Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, and Shaun Donovan ’87. They discussed the future of the University and Allston.
Donovan, former U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development, was named senior strategist and adviser to Faust on Allston and campus development in September.
While construction is on schedule for a fall 2020 opening, the University’s development plans in Allston have not been without disruption in the past. During the recession of 2009, the University halted construction of the complex, proposing a revised institutional master plan for Allston in 2013. In the proposal, Harvard outlined its plans in Allston for the next decade. Above-ground construction of the 500,000 square foot facility began again in July 2017, and construction appears to be on schedule. The complex will house two-thirds of SEAS—more than 1,800 students, researchers and faculty.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said that though there is still work to be done, he is excited about the progress of the project.
“It’s obviously a great milestone and we’re something just under 1000 days before the first day of classes, when the Class of 2020 will be the first group of students to enjoy the fabulous new building,” Karoff said.
Standing atop the steel framework, construction crew members revealed a large banner on Wednesday: “It all starts here.”

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences will likely vote on a final motion associated with the College’s controversial social group policy at their monthly meeting Tuesday.
David L. Howell, a professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, introduced the motion in November. It moves that the Faculty recognize that basic rights and freedoms may come into conflict with each other at Harvard, and in these cases, “it is the responsibility of the faculty and administration of Harvard College to establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.”
At last month’s Faculty meeting, the Faculty voted down a separate motion intended to counteract the policy, which, starting with the class of 2021, prohibits members of single gender final clubs or Greek organizations from holding athletic team captaincies or club leadership positions or being recommended for certain postgraduate fellowships.
During months of Faculty debate about the policy, the issue of shared governance between the faculty and administration emerged as a large part of the discussion. At the November meeting, Classics professor Richard F. Thomas charged that, if passed, Howell’s motion would cede control from the faculty to the administration.
In an interview last month, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said that in his opinion, the Howell motion would not affect the dynamic between the Faculty and administrators if passed.
Faculty members will discuss several other substantive docket items prior to the Howell motion Tuesday.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris is scheduled to introduce a motion revamping the College’s Advanced Standing policy, which allows undergraduates to graduate in three years or pursue a master's degree in their fourth year at the College.
If the motion passes, all students will be eligible for Advanced Standing; previously, students were required to have earned high scores on several Advanced Placement exams before entering Harvard. Additionally, the requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degrees will not be lessened for students with Advanced Standing.
The motion also requests a review of the College’s current language requirement, which mandates that all students either pass a language placement test or enroll in two semesters of a language course.
“The subcommittee feels that the language requirement in its current form promotes inequity among the student body,” a report submitted by Harris reads. “Those students who attended a high school that provided strong language instruction are able to bypass a requirement while those who attended a less strong high school are not.”
Harris’s motion is only up for discussion at Tuesday’s meeting. The earliest it could be approved is at the February Faculty meeting.
The Faculty will also cast votes on whether or not to move Faculty meetings earlier by one hour, starting in the 2018–2019 academic year, in order to accommodate the new course schedule, and whether to approve a change to cross-registration policy for students in the College.
Dean of Harvard Summer School Sandra A. Naddaff ’75 will also announce the upcoming courses for the 2018 summer term.

A release of pepper spray in the Harvard MBTA station briefly closed the Red Line stop Sunday, burning the eyes of some passerby and hospitalizing one person.
The Cambridge Fire Department, Cambridge Police Department, and MBTA Police responded to the incident just before 6 p.m. and found a gaseous odor, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. Police also briefly closed Harvard Square to motor vehicle traffic as they responded to the incident.
Paramedics were at the scene to provide medical treatment, according to a tweet from Cambridge Fire Department.
“Medical responded and treated several people with only one being transported to [the] hospital,” Warnick wrote in an email. “All others refused further treatment.”
Cambridge Fire Department took air readings in the station and reported “no indication of elevated readings,” according to Warnick. In a tweet at 7:46 p.m., Cambridge Fire Department said they determined that the odor was caused by pepper spray released in the ramp area between train levels.
Shortly after the response, the MBTA tweeted at 6:15 p.m. that they had closed the Red Line and several bus routes to the Harvard Square station.
After venting the station, within half an hour, Cambridge Fire Department cleared the station and all lines resumed regular service, according to Warnick. Streets were also reopened.

In their first official meeting at the helm of the Undergraduate Council, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 introduced a piece of legislation that brings together student groups to throw a social event.
The legislation created the Matchmaker Collaboration Grant, a signature initiative proposed in Zhang and Boucher’s campaign for UC leadership last month. The grant will utilize two burst packs—$3,000 sums meant to spur a wide range of initiatives intended to benefit the College’s student body. Boucher said the idea was inspired by what he called a lack of social opportunities on Harvard’s campus.
“The general idea is Harvard is decentralized," he said. "We want to fix that we want to add new social spaces. It’s something that we've been very passionate about."
Participating student organizations will complete an online form before receiving funding to host a social event between two random student organizations, according to Boucher. Each set of groups will receive $300 in total to throw the event.
“We’re trying to create as low a barrier to entry as possible,” he said.
Winthrop House representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 questioned whether or not the Council should pair random groups instead of groups that share similarities.
“Do you feel that $6000 might be better spent trying to connect groups that might actually maybe have something in common or might really particularly benefit from collaboration?” he asked at the meeting.
Boucher said that the pairings should be random, as the legislation is intended to spark interactions between students that otherwise wouldn’t happen.
“Because Harvard is such a decentralized campus, we don't have a lot of those spontaneous random interactions that we would if we, say, had a multicultural center,” he said.
The Council also voted to endorse a resolution that calls on Harvard to create more summer opportunities for students interested in public sector work.
They also agreed to fund two burst packs—totalling $6,000—for six peer counseling groups to use towards “furniture and space expenses” for their spaces. Boucher said, however, that the groups are free to use the funding for other amenities if they choose.
After technology troubles during its November election, the Council also voted to appoint a Tech Chair to work on projects across the UC, but especially to ensure that future elections run smoothly online.
Students complained that the voting system was down for periods of time, and some candidates directed voters to contact Harvard University Information Technology and the Council’s own Election Commission to resolve the issue. Towards the end of the election, some students submitted ballots via email, though they did not count towards the final vote.
The Council also voted to elect Jackson C. Walker ’21 as Secretary and Nadine M. Khoury ’20 as Treasurer. The body will next reconvene next semester.

More than a year after Massachusetts voters legalized marijuana, the leafy green plant is on the minds of Harvard Square politicians, business owners, and University students as the opening date for recreational pot shops in the state approaches.
Fifty-three percent of voters approved ballot Question 4 in November 2016, joining eight other states in legalizing recreational use of the drug. Massachusetts had previously decriminalized the possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2008 and legalized medical marijuana in 2012.
After intense debate over the summer, the Massachusetts Legislature passed a compromise marijuana bill in July that laid out procedures for regulating recreational marijuana—and put in place a July 2018 date for the state’s first recreational retailers to open their doors.
Though recreational marijuana shops have been given the green light to begin operating in Massachusetts, the Cambridge city government is still hashing out the details. The issue of marijuana has been on the Cambridge City Council’s agenda since its legalization last November, and the body could begin approving licenses this spring.
Even though it has been legal for less than a year, Harvard students are not exactly unfamiliar with the drug. In The Crimson's annual senior survey, 51 percent of student respondents in the Class of 2017 reported having used marijuana at least once. In a survey distributed to members of the Class of 2021 this summer, 27.7 percent having tried the drug.
But in light of broad usage on campus and acceptance statewide, University policy hasn’t changed to reflect Massachusetts law: marijuana use, possession, and distribution remains a violation of University rules. Pot shops may soon come to Harvard Square, but Harvard students may be limited in their ability to frequent them.
For years, Square residents have had no trouble securing their share of marijuana paraphernalia: The Hempest and a branch of the Boston Smoke Shop have long provided students and local denizens with bongs, lights, and marijuana-related apparel.
But nearly five years after medical marijuana was legalized for permit holders in Massachusetts, Harvard Square still has not seen its first dispensary come to town.
Barring any unforeseen roadblocks, that will soon change. Healthy Pharms Inc., a nonprofit medical dispensary based in Georgetown, Mass., plans to open a storefront at 98 Winthrop St. in coming months. The Cambridge Planning Board approved a permit for Healthy Pharms to open a storefront in Harvard Square in February, when they modified zoning ordinances to permit five or six new medical dispensaries to open in the area.
But Healthy Pharms’s plans have not gone without complications. A certificate of occupancy from the city and final approval from the Massachusetts Department of Health still have not arrived, though, preventing Healthy Pharms from opening its doors.
Several members of the Cambridge City Council did not respond to requests for comment, and city councillor Jan Devereux declined to comment.
Another barrier Healthy Pharms must overcome is a federal lawsuit brought by the owner of Crimson Galeria, Raj Dhanda, who argues that his businesses have been “substantially injured by a conspiracy to sell marijuana” and should be compensated for these losses.
Scott A. Schlager, an attorney representing Dhanda in the lawsuit, wrote in an emailed statement that “dispensary owners must take proper measures to perform appropriate abutter outreach.”
“The first step in any successful development project is neighbor support,” he added.
Even if Dhanda were to win the lawsuit, though, Healthy Pharms’s operations would most likely already be in full swing. “We don’t anticipate any major developments until January or February,” said Schlager, a timetable that could jeopardize Dhanda’s quest to block the shop from ever opening its doors.
Similar lawsuits by pot shop opponents and the Department of Justice have floundered in other parts of the country. And in an interview, Valerio G. Romano, an attorney for Healthy Pharms, pointed to a sharp condemnation of Dhanda’s lawsuit from Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, and said that medical marijuana has received “overwhelming” support from the community.
In a June email exchange obtained by The Crimson, Jillson urged Dhanda to withdraw his lawsuit “for the good of Harvard Square and for the good of our community.”
Several managers of Harvard Square businesses declined to comment on the lawsuit and the possibility of recreational dispensaries coming to the area.
With recreational marijuana now legal in Massachusetts, pot shops could begin to roll up to the streets of Cambridge.
Last November, Cambridge residents overwhelmingly voted “yes” on Question 4, and the Massachusetts legislature’s July marijuana bill made it harder for the city to go back on that decision.
To address the issue of local control over pot shops, that law put in place a compromise provision that requires towns and cities that voted “yes” on Question 4 to pass another referendum if they wish to ban the opening of recreational marijuana stores. In municipalities that voted “no,” however, local elected officials could make that call.
The law also capped the tax rate on retail marijuana purchases at 20 percent, gave oversight power of marijuana regulations to a five-person Cannabis Control Commission, and set July 2018 as the start date for recreational sales.
Since Cambridge voted “yes” on Question 4—with 71.6 percent of voters casting a ballot in favor of marijuana legalization—Cambridge residents are unlikely to block pot shops. State cannabis regulators are slated to finish writing regulations by March 15, 2018 and will begin accepting applications for recreational licenses on April 1, 2018.
At the moment, Cambridge only has zoning ordinances for medical marijuana, and the City Council still needs to determine zoning rules for recreational outlets, according to Jeff Roberts, the senior manager for zoning and development in the Cambridge Community Development Department.
“Cambridge currently only has zoning for medical marijuana. There will be future discussion for non-medical marijuana, something we're looking at internally,” Roberts said at a Cambridge planning board meeting last month. “Ultimately the City Council will need to engage in this question and decide how they want to zone for non-medical marijuana.”
Since the city government has not completed this process, recreational companies have yet to make moves to open up establishments in Harvard Square.
“We haven’t seen any movement. We haven’t heard of any recreational marijuana shops coming to Cambridge or to Harvard Square, at least not at the moment,” said Jillson. “There is a lot of work that needs to be done in order to get to that point, both I think at the state level and certainly at the city council level,” she said.
If pot shops do come to the Square, business owners and Harvard affiliates don’t predict that they will make major waves.
“I don't really forsee a lot of changes,” Rosaline Kovacs, owner of Shays Pub and Wine Bar. “I think that already there's a lot of people that smoke. I don’t see this area getting a lot of undesirables—I mean it does have some already, obviously, but I don’t think this is going to be a huge problem.”
Economics lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron said he predicts the tax revenue from pot sales will be negligible, and that the overall effect on the local business community will be “very small.”
Dhanda, though, will continue to oppose any effort to bring marijuana to the Square, his lawyer said.
“Should a proposed recreational shop impinge upon any of his property holdings, Mr. Dhanda will take all necessary precautions to preserve and protect the integrity of the surrounding community,” Schlager said.
But marijuana shops need not worry about facing any extra scrutiny from the Cambridge Police Department.
“If [marijuana shops] are approved, they will be treated like any other business in the city and enforced as appropriate,” said Jeremy Warnick, a spokesperson for the Cambridge Police Department.
While recreational marijuana businesses clearly have a legal right set up shop in Harvard Square, students’ ability to frequent them is more cloudy. Since the legalization of marijuana in Massachusetts, the University has stood firm on its long-standing policy prohibiting drug use.
Because Harvard receives federal funding, the University would jeopardize those funds if it moved to permit marijuana or any other drug on campus.
"We follow federal law on this, and so, federal law prohibits this,” said the College’s Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. “Massachusetts law is new, but our policy has not changed.”
The College has had to adapt its messaging to students in the wake of the drug’s legalization statewide. Earlier this year, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to add a clarifying statement—proposed by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—to the College’s policy in the student handbook.
Despite changes to Massachusetts law, “federal law prohibits the possession, use, or distribution of marijuana, including for medical purposes, on Harvard property or as part of a Harvard activity,” the handbook now reads.
Miron, known for his libertarian views, believes the federal government should just legalize the drug. “It would be better if the federal government legalized marijuana and all other controlled substances,” he said.
While it remains illegal, though, the University follows specific protocols for handling breaches of the policy. In a statement, Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano outlined the process it follows when a student is found with marijuana.
“Per the College Student Handbook, despite the recent changes to state law, the possession of marijuana still is prohibited by federal law and University policy,” said Catalano. “If the HUPD encountered students in possession of marijuana, then officers typically would confiscate the marijuana and report the matter to the appropriate dean of students office.”
The College’s light-handed approach to punishment, though, remains just as consistent as its policy. In the past five years, a total of only 56 cases of drug use—not limited to marijuana—have come before the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.
No students have been formally admonished for drugs since the 2013-2014 school year, and only three students have faced probation. No student has been forced to withdraw since the 2012-2013 academic year, when five students left Harvard because of drug-related transgressions.
The vast majority of those who come before the Ad Board for drug-related offenses receive only a “House Warning.” Since 2013-2014, the disciplinary body has distributed between 10 and 12 of these warnings each year. Jasmine M. Waddell, resident dean of Elm Yard and a member of the Ad Board, said there has been no noticeable change to those figures so far this academic year.
“With regard to just having a bag of marijuana in the dorm, that’s something that we will also address and with either [smoking or possession], there will be educational intervention through the Office of Student [Life],” Waddell said. “But you’re not going to be arrested or kicked out or anything like that, but there will be a reaction or a response.”
Administrators are more concerned about students dealing marijuana than smoking it, Waddell said.
“The thing that we worry about is distribution,” she said. “If you have a big enough amount of anything, and we think you might be distributing, that becomes a different issue.  That is a legal issue.”
Catalano echoed Waddell’s statement about the harsher punishment for distributors. “Students and others distributing drugs would be subject to arrest for that behavior,” he said.
The line between University jurisdiction and Massachusetts law is still hazy, though, and it is unclear what actions would be taken towards Harvard students who purchase and smoke marijuana off campus. Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Warnick said the department will enforce laws on the state books.
“We enforce the law(s) as they are constituted,” Warnick wrote in an emailed statement.
Amid this ambiguity, many students are still reluctant to talk about their opinions on the drug on the record: More than a dozen students declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes the scoreboard does not tell the whole story: That was the case for the Harvard women’s hockey team on Saturday afternoon. The Crimson skated past Princeton by a 4-1 tally in what was a much more tightly contested affair than the box score might suggest.
Harvard (5-4-1, 3-2-1 Ivy League) and the visiting Tigers (3-7-3, 3-5-1) entered Saturday’s game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on a bit of a skid, each desperate for a win. Both teams had lost of three of their past four games, and the Crimson was eager to complete the season sweep of Princeton, having already beaten the Tigers by a 3-2 score on the road.
A late barrage of shots on Princeton goaltender Alyssa DaSilva resulted in third period goals from freshman Brooke Jovanovich and sophomore Val Turgeon, securing the victory for Harvard. The senior struggled in net for the visitors, in what was just her fourth start of the year.
Opposing the Princeton netminder was sophomore goaltender Beth Larcom, who had a standout afternoon between the pipes for the Crimson, conceding just one goal and repelling 32 shots to secure her seventh win of the season.
“Every game that I go into, I have to lock down and be focused; all that matters is the next shot,” Larcom said. “I found my groove and fed off the team’s energy. But at the end of the day, everyone has a job to do, and I’m glad I was able to get mine done.”
Special teams proved to be a crucial element of Saturday’s tilt, especially in a sloppy first period that featured six penalties.
Just as Harvard finished killing a cross-checking penalty to Bradley Fusco, the Crimson regained possession in its own end and orchestrated a breakaway that led to the game’s first goal, a mere 10 seconds after getting back to full strength.
The Crimson was able to successfully defend three first period Princeton power plays to take a 1-0 lead into the first intermission.
“One thing that is important to us is penalty killing; we take a lot of pride in it,” co-captain Kate Hallett said. “That requires a lot of communication and composure both on and off the ice. By being diligent and disciplined while sticking to our system, we’re confident in our ability.”
In spite of its lead, Harvard entered the intermission trailing 16-10 in shots, and the second period offered more of the same. The opportunistic Princeton offense continued to assail Larcom and the Crimson defense, and the equalizer finally followed five minutes into the second period.
The Tigers’ 21st shot was the one that bore fruit, as junior forward Keiko DeClerk snuck a shot by Larcom to tie the score at one. The visitors continued to apply heavy pressure and appeared to wrest momentum away from Harvard.
Towards the end of the second period, a quick break by Harvard resulted in a golden opportunity for Jovanovich, but the puck was cleared out of the crease by Princeton.
The opportunity was a sign of things to come, and less than a minute later senior forward Haley Mullins scored from close-range to put Harvard ahead 2-1. It was the third goal of the season for the co-captain, and the Crimson held on for the remainder of the period, entering the intermission with a one-goal lead.
Despite being outshot by a 30-19 margin through two periods, solid goaltending and costly penalties from the Tigers allowed Harvard to regain control of the game in the third period.
With time winding down in the third period, Turgeon took over the game, assisting her fellow forward Jovanovich to give the Crimson a 3-1 lead with under seven minutes remaining.
“Val definitely had a lot of energy on the ice yesterday,” Larcom said. “She created a lot of chances for us. To see her have so much success is great because she’s been working hard and contributing a lot.”
Just three minutes later, Jovanovich returned the favor on the power-play, feeding Turgeon for her second goal of the game and sixth of the season. For Turgeon, Saturday’s first star of the game, the two goals and three points were both career highs. The Denver, Colo., native’s breakout game, along with Larcom’s solid goaltending were the defining performances from a solid home victory.
“I think yesterday’s victory was great,” Hallett said. “It’s amazing when you can come off a loss and bounce back like today. The energy that we used to put Princeton away today was exciting.”

For the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy League), an early season tune-up offered much promise for the potential that this 2017-2018 team could reach. Several Harvard swimmers attended the Texas Invitational in Austin, Texas, while some divers attended the Georgia Invitational in Athens, Ga.
The Texas Invitational was a prime opportunity for the Crimson to swim against ranked programs, three of which rank within the top 10.
“Racing in Texas was a great way for us to get out of the Ivy League bubble,” sophomore swimmer Raphael Marcoux said. “To be able to attend a meet with that caliber of competition really sets us up well for the end of the season.”
Sophomore Dean Farris led the Crimson in Austin, recording a second-place finish in the finals of the men’s 200 freestyle, second to only Texas junior Townley Haas.
Haas, an Olympic gold medalist for the United States, edged out Farris by just under a second. Farris’ time of 1:33.27 was enough to narrowly beat out Arizona State’s Cameron Craig by two milliseconds for second-place.
“For Dean to be right behind Townley was amazing,” junior Logan Houck said. “With that time, Dean will be going to the NCAA Championships for sure….His training’s been great, his racing’s been great, and he had a really exceptional performance.”
Farris also competed in the finals of the men’s 100-yard backstroke, logging a fifth-place finish in the event, with a time of 46.32 seconds.
Houck and fellow junior Brennan Novak also had strong finishes for the Crimson, competing in the B Final of the 1,650-yard freestyle. Houck finished sixth in the B Final while Novak completed the race in 17th.
The junior duo also competed in the B Final of the 500-yard freestyle with Novak finishing 10th and Houck right behind him in 12th.
Elsewhere, Harvard swimming rounded out the weekend with an eighth-place finish in the men’s 400-yard freestyle relay. The quartet of Farris, Marcoux, Mahlon Reihman, and Paul O’Hara posted a time of 2:55.95, a full second faster than last year’s finish.
“I really liked how we all came together to compete against some of the best teams in the country,” Marcoux said. “We put together some great performances, I’m thrilled about how we swam.”
The Crimson also had a successful weekend on the diving board, performing impressively at the University of Georgia. The competition, which spanned Friday and Saturday, was a terrific opportunity for Harvard to face competition comprised entirely of ranked teams.
Co-captain Bobby Ross starred for the Crimson, finishing second in the men’s one-meter diving finals. Ross was accompanied in the final by teammates Hal Watts, Alex Decaprio, and David Pfeiffer.
Ross, who finished fourth in the preliminaries, improved his standing in the final and finished with a score of 336.10. Ross was only bested by Auburn’s Pete Turnham, who took first with a score of 335.75.
A strong finish from senior David Pfeifer in the men’s three-meter dive rounded out the weekend for the Crimson. Pfeifer, who finished fifth in the final, recorded a score of 322.50, finishing three spots ahead of fellow senior Ross.
The standout performances of seniors Ross and Pfeifer were the highlights of the divers’ trip to the Peach State, with strong showings from freshmen Watts and Decaprio rounding out the tournament.
The Texas and Georgia Invitationals were good measuring sticks for a Harvard swimming and diving Team that has gone 3-0 to start the season. Competing against top talent from around the country, the Crimson performed admirably in the water.
“We knew that Texas is one of the fastest, if not the fastest teams in the country,” Houck said. “We knew that the Invitational was going to offer us very stiff competition, hopefully we’ll be more prepared for the Ivy League Championship at the end of the season”.
The team will enter the holiday break hoping the encouraging results from the weekend are a sign of things to come. The team will return to the pool the afternoon of Jan. 6 at Arizona State.

As a renowned venture capitalist, James W. Breyer has built his career in investing in the right companies at the right time, helping young start-ups grow into blockbuster brands.
But his biggest investment yet may be in Harvard’s future. As one of the 15 members of the committee searching for Harvard’s 29th president, Breyer will pull from a long career of identifying and investing in promising people and growing technological expertise at a time when Harvard is constructing its future in engineering. 
After earning his M.B.A. at Harvard Business School in 1987, Breyer began in venture capitalism and innovation, focusing on entertainment and technology companies.
He started at Accel Partners, a firm that became one of Facebook’s largest shareholders. Breyer himself was one of Facebook’s first venture investors and served on the social networking giant’s Board of Directors for eight years until 2013.
Arthur C. Patterson ’66, who co-founded Accel in 1983 with Jim R. Swartz ’64, wrote in an email that Breyer has had a “highly successful venture capital career identifying and helping exceptional entrepreneurs develop their companies in the highly competitive information technology business.”
Breyer has also helped develop successful companies through his firm, Breyer Capital, which he founded in 2006. Breyer Capital’s investments focus on areas including artificial intelligence, social media, and entertainment. Beyond Facebook, Breyer has served on the boards of Marvel Entertainment, Etsy, and 21st Century Fox.
Though he’s based in California, Breyer has kept close ties to Harvard over the years. He has served on the Dean’s Board of Advisors of the Business School and was chair of the advisory council of the Business School’s California Research Center. In addition, he is a member of the University’s Global Advisory Council and has advised the University on aspects of edX, Harvard’s platform for online learning. Breyer, who went to Stanford for his undergraduate years,  joined the Corporation in July 2013.
Former Dean of the Business School Jay O. Light, who taught Breyer, called Breyer a “forward-looking thinker” with a stronghold in technology.
“What he adds to a group I think is he’s constantly coming up with different ways of thinking about the world,” said Light, who serves with Breyer on the board of the Blackstone Group.
“He was probably more than any other always coming up with a new and different way of thinking about it, thinking about it in terms of how the world was going to change, how we were going to be ten years from now,” Light added.
Breyer’s interests, however, span beyond just technology, according to Light. Breyer serves on the board of several museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Breyer is the son of Hungarian immigrants and has fought for immigration rights in the United States through FWD.us, a lobbying group founded in 2013 by business leaders in technology focusing on immigration rights and education.
Light said that he has spoken to Breyer about the search. He said that Breyer was receptive to his ideas about how “medicine, biology, engineering, and the intersection of all of those” represent an “important opportunity.”
“I think he agreed with that,” Light said.
Patterson wrote that Breyer will bring “many valuable insights and skills” to the search.
“His first-hand working experience with so many dynamic creative leaders who are interpersonally sophisticated and have common sense will help him recognize the best candidates,” Patterson wrote.
With only six months on the Harvard Corporation under his belt, David M. Rubenstein has been thrust into helping the University through one of its most consequential transitions: finding a new president.
But Rubenstein, a 68-year-old private equity titan known for his philanthropic undertakings, isn’t new to presidential searches. As the chair of Board of Trustees at Duke University, his alma mater, he helped select Duke’s current president in 2016. (He also sits on the board of the University of Chicago).
While Rubenstein has spent his professional life in corporate boardrooms—Carlyle co-founder Dan D’Aniello said Rubenstein has “probably one of the most extensive networks of people”—friends and associates say it is his experience advising universities that will inform his approach to the search.
“David, I think, is approaching a university with a certain kind of reverence,” said University professor Paul Farmer, who knows Rubenstein through his humanitarian work and serving together on Duke University’s board of trustees.
“This a guy who knows the business world, he knows museums, he knows all kinds of philanthropic work. But he knows a lot about universities and what they need to function, and that’s what I heard him talk about–we need someone who understands that universities are different,” Farmer said, referring to the search.
The friends and associates say that Rubenstein will favor candidates with academic experience who will make Harvard more affordable and accessible.
“David was first generation. I think he got financial aid himself,” Ned Gilhuly, a member of Duke’s board of trustees, said. “So he’s very sort of viscerally connected to and believes in the importance of making sure that the fantastic institutions are available to people irrespective of their means.”
Rubenstein’s penchant for underdogs may lead him to turn to candidates who are less obvious at face value but who show “potential,” Farmer said.
“He’s looking for promise and opening doors,” he added.
Rubenstein has also promoted universities’ role in shaping public policy through significant donations to the Kennedy School and Duke’s school of public policy. (He has public policy experience himself; he served in President Jimmy Carter’s administration).
And he has substantial experience with higher ed fundraising: he chaired Duke’s $3.7 billion capital campaign, the Harvard Kennedy School’s most recent campaign, and Harvard’s ongoing University-wide fundraising drive that set a higher education record.
“He has a really clear understanding, born out of hands-on involvement and experience in a university, [of] what it takes to be a good university president. And that will make him a really good spokesperson, advocate, and selector or judge of candidates,” Gilhuly said.
During Duke’s presidential search, their committee outlined a set of requirements they wanted candidates to meet—namely, that they hold full professorships and have experience with university administration. Rubenstein agreed with those parameters, Duke search committee members said.
“We felt that that was incredibly important, particularly when it came to the faculty, so they could see this person as a colleague and not someone who had been selected from the outside—a retired politician, a retired general or admiral, a business background, any of these kinds of things,” said Jack Bovender, who led the search and replaced Rubenstein as chair of Duke’s board of trustees.
Search committee members traveled to universities around the country to conduct interviews, and Rubenstein sat in on the final three, according to Duke committee member and professor of public policy Donald H. Taylor, Jr.
Committee members declined to name specific candidates they considered, but said they looked closely at administrators at peer institutions. When Duke ultimately selected former University of Pennsylvania provost Vincent Price, Rubenstein praised Price’s scholarship, his recognition of the importance of diversity and inclusion, and his global reach.
Although Rubenstein’s involvement at Harvard runs long and deep, he is not an alum himself—and he is unlikely to accord particular weight to candidates who are Harvard graduates. In an interview last spring about his ascent to the Corporation, he said a Harvard degree is not a prerequisite for successfully stewarding the University.
“I think if you’re as important to the country as Harvard is you probably need to take a look at whether you should only have Harvard graduates doing certain things. Harvard has had a number of presidents for example who did not go to Harvard,” he said in May.
Rubenstein’s higher education networks wrap around the globe, so he may even turn to candidates outside of the United States. Faust credits him with launching the Harvard Global Advisory Council, a network of prominent alumni scattered across the world.
And colleagues say he will give significant consideration to faculty perspectives through the process. “In my experience with David, he was always very interested in what faculty thought,” Taylor said.
But despite his propensity to cater to academics, Rubenstein retains a businessman’s sensibility in his approach to university governance. Whoever Rubenstein decides to throw his support behind will be someone who can deliver tangible improvements, his associates say.
“I think he understands some of the subtle differences between the business world and academia, but at the same time I do think he is very results-oriented,” Gilhuly said. “He believes in metrics—he wants to measure an institution’s progress and success.”
UPDATED: December 4, 2017 at 12:12 p.m.
When Barry R. Sloane ’77 heard his longtime friend Paul J. Finnegan ’75 would help lead the search for Harvard’s next president, he wasn’t surprised.
Sloane said Finnegan—who currently serves as University Treasurer—has been devoted to Harvard since his time studying at the College.
“I’ve known him since we overlapped as undergraduates,” Sloane said. “He’s been enormously dedicated to Harvard and I would suggest has really been a leader of the Harvard community [for] a long time.”
Finnegan is one of 12 members of the Harvard Corporation who, along with three members of the Board of Overseers, staff the committee searching for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust. His search duties add to an already lengthy list: In addition to his work as University treasurer, Finnegan serves as co-chair of the Harvard Campaign’s executive committee, has previously led the Harvard Alumni Association, and holds leadership roles in a wide variety of Harvard’s schools.
Friends and colleagues, pointing to Finnegan’s long track record at Harvard, say he will likely play an influential role in directing the search in months to come.
“I’m sure he will be a strong and respected voice on that committee,” Sloane said.
Robert D. Reischauer, former senior fellow of the Corporation, called Finnegan one of Harvard’s most “devoted” alumni leaders in a 2012 interview with the Harvard Gazette.
“He will bring us not only important financial and organizational expertise and a deep knowledge of the University and its governance, but also a broad set of relationships across the community and a wonderful way of motivating people to stay engaged with Harvard,” Reischauer said at the time.
Sloane said Finnegan has been eager to shoulder Harvard responsibilities since his undergraduate days. While a student at the College, Finnegan balanced membership in the all-male AD Club and competing for Harvard’s ski team with academic commitments. Sloane called Finnegan a “motivated student,” graduating cum laude in Government.
After college, Finnegan attended Harvard Business School. He is now the co-CEO of Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm based in Chicago.
Although he said he has not spoken with Finnegan about the presidential search, Mitchell L. Dong ’75, his college classmate, said he thinks Finnegan might favor a candidate with a business background. As treasurer, Finnegan is closely involved in Harvard’s financial strategy—including the ongoing overhaul of Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s $37.1 billion endowment.
Finnegan may also look for a candidate likely to continue Faust’s roughly year-old penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, which—starting with the Class of 2021—bar members of these groups from campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships. Faust debuted this social group policy in May 2016, and has drawn both criticism and acclaim from students and faculty ever since.
A week after Faust announced the penalties, Finnegan penned a letter to the editor in The Crimson supporting the sanctions.
“Many have argued that the traditions of final clubs must be upheld, and indeed I and many others value our experiences as members,” Finnegan wrote. “But our aspirations for Harvard and Harvard students in the 21st century demand that we work to create an environment in which everyone has the opportunity to thrive.”
In an interview in November 2017, Harvard Corporation senior fellow William F. Lee ’72 said he thinks Harvard’s next president will likely keep the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups largely unaltered.
Finnegan has not commented publicly about the search.
Harvard Corporation member Shirley M. Tilghman knows a good deal about presidential searches, having emerged on top in one herself.
A molecular biologist by trade, Tilghman was named the first female president of Princeton—and the second female president in the Ivy League—in 2001, and served there until 2013.
In the coming months, Tilghman will sit on the opposite side of the conference table as she and the other 14 members of the search committee narrow down a list of names, interview candidates, and ultimately select Harvard’s 29th president. As one of two former university presidents serving on the Corporation, she brings acute knowledge of higher education administration to the search process.
Harold T. Shapiro, the Princeton president whom Tilghman succeeded, said he knew early on that she would play a leadership role in the university.
“She’s often quiet, but often very, very effective,” Shapiro said, adding that she was widely respected by the faculty. “Some people just have a capacity to advance the ball down the field with people who have somewhat differing views, but all are trying to do the right thing, so to speak.”
Tilghman may have an eye toward scientists during the search: She completed her postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health, worked on a committee of the Human Genome Project, and founded Princeton’s genetics institute in 1998. In 2002, she was a recipient of the L'Oréal-UNESCO Award for Women in Science.
Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former director of NIH and the National Cancer Institute, called Tilghman a “delight to work with.” The two met over three decades ago, and Tilghman served on NIH’s advisory committee while Varmus was director.
“She has been one of the most imaginative and outspoken people on questions that are related to how we attract and train people in the sciences,” Varmus said.
Tilghman has also emphasized both racial and gender diversity in hirings and campus life in her time as Princeton’s president. In 2006, she created Princeton’s Center for African-American Studies. She also oversaw the appointment of four women to positions in Princeton’s senior administration, drawing criticism from a conservative campus journal.
Harvey Mudd President Maria Klawe, whom Tilghman previously appointed dean of Princeton School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said Tilghman recognizes the importance of diversity.
“It doesn’t mean that the person couldn’t be a white male,” Klawe said of the Harvard search, “but it means that we have to be looking for somebody who will be a champion, who will really move the university forward in this way.”
Shapiro added that Tilghman will bring her “extraordinary experience in judgment” to Harvard’s search committee.
“A university president has to be able to say no to a lot of things,” Shapiro said. “The capacity to say no to someone, and yet still have them walk out of that room feeling that you understood them, that you appreciated them, that you wished you could help them but you just can’t do everything, is not a talent everybody has. And it was clear to me that she had that talent in dealing with issues that came before her.”
