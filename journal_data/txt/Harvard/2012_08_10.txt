After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last Harvard athlete to compete in the London Olympics was Alex Meyer '10 in the men's 10k open water marathon.
Meyer had legitimate hopes of medalling, holding the 2010 World Championship in the 25k open water race. But it was not meant to be, as Meyer finished 10th in a 25 swimmer field, just over 50 seconds behind the gold medal winner, Oussama Mellouli.
Meyer drew headlines in the lead up to these Games in part because of his former teammate and friend Fran Crippen. Crippen, who mentored Meyer, died in an open water race in Dubai in October 2010. Water temperatures in excess of 86 Fahrenheit caused Crippen to overheat and drown. Meyer led the search party.
Entering the race as the only American—he would say it was only fitting in Crippen's absence—Meyer spent the first two laps in the leading group, crossing the checkpoint in fourth and third, respectively. He eventually fell back to 14th before sprinting to come in 10th—with just four seconds separating 10th and 14th.
Meyer's defeat closes out the Olympics for the Crimson, hauling in an impressive two golds, one silver and one bronze.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman reported that she was raped in Harvard Yard early Friday morning, University police announced in an email to the Harvard community.
The Harvard University Police Department said that the victim, a woman unaffiliated with Harvard, said she was grabbed and dragged behind Massachusetts Hall after she entered Johnston Gate at around 3:15 a.m. The email described the offender as a very tanned, possibly Hispanic man in his mid-twenties, 5’7” in height with medium build and dark hair, wearing a white shirt.
The assault was the first stranger rape reported on campus in more than 12 years, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson. He said that an average of four students a year report rape by someone known to the victim to HUPD.
Anyone with information about the alleged rape is asked to contact HUPD's Criminal Investigation Division at 617-495-1796.

August 8, 1944: Mechanical Brains Aid in Tabulations
University Hall boasts a set of a mechanical wizards that can do nearly everything but shape College policy. Since December 1943, when acceleration began and clerical work had to be stepped up, five International Business Machines have been adding, subtracting, separating, sorting, tabulating, and reproducing Harvard records, with two operators doing the work of 30 pre-war secretaries.
August 11, 1964: Vellucci Uncovers Local Rat Menace
City Councilman Alfred E. Vellucci has called for a full-scale investigation of a newly uncovered rat menace in Cambridge. He said that he had gotten "several complaints" that homes in the River St. area, particularly near the Charles River, are becoming infested with rodents.
"I don't know whether these are muskrats from the Charles," he said, "or just plain ordinary rats, but some of the neighbors have told me that they are nearly as big as cats."
Vellucci said he is certain the complaints are legitimate. "Not long ago," he said, "I happened to be present when Cambridge police shot a large rodent between two houses in the River St. neighborhood."
August 11, 1965: Violence Erupts in Allston As BRA Evicts More Residents
The Boston Redevelopment Authority Monday captured a major fortified citadel that had been occupied by North Harvard urban renewal opponents but only after last-ditch resistance erupted into a bitter melee in which 12 people were arrested for trespassing.
The trouble came when sheriff's deputies attempted to make their way through about 20 people blocking the entrance to the home of an about-to-be evicted tenant.
August 9, 1968: Square Scorns Spiro T. Agnew
Most people around the Square had already been swallowing hard for eleven hours when word came up from Miami yesterday that Spiro T. Agnew was Nixon's running mate. That did it. Young and old were revolted. A New Nausea swept the area.
August 9, 1974: New Freshman Domitory To Open on Time
Harvard's new freshman dormitory, Canaday Hall, will be ready to house incoming freshmen in September despite technical problems that will present final completion of the building until later in the fall.
August 10, 1984: VDTs, Computers Revolutionize Crimson Newsroom
The clickety-clack of manual typewriters which kept the Crimson newsroom buzzing for more than 100 years finally came to an end yesterday.
The reason: a new computer system that fully integrates the writing, editing, and typesetting of the newspaper was installed this week.
Under the new system. Crimson writers enter their news articles, opinion pieces, and editorials into a video display terminal, which acts as a word-processor.
