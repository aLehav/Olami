After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) lives an average American life. In the suburbs of Atlanta, he lives with a nuclear family—two parents and a kid sister who likes to cook—in a house so well-furnished it seems to spring from the pages of a Pottery Barn catalogue. In the waning days of high school, Simon and his friends hang out at the local Waffle House, drinking too much coffee while worrying about college. It’s the sort of tableau of American adolescence, cobbled together from TV dramas and census bureau data—the picture of averageness.
At first glance, Simon’s life seems so idyllic that it’s cookie cutter—another teen love story, another meditation on nostalgia and hometowns. But within the first five minutes of the film, “Love, Simon” breaks the mold of its genre. Or in Simon’s own words, from the opening monologue: “I’m just like you. I have a totally normal life. Except I have one huge-ass secret.” The secret? Simon is gay, and very much in the closet. When another student comes out under a pseudonym on their school’s gossip website, Creek Secrets, Simon begins an anonymous email correspondence with him and quickly develops feelings for him. But when an unpopular classmate stumbles upon the emails, he blackmails Simon into helping him improve his social standing and romantic prospects with Simon’s friend, Abby (Alexandra Shipp). As a result, Simon becomes enmeshed in the complicated turmoil of his friends’ interpersonal drama, forced to weave lie after lie to protect his own secrets.
Directed by Greg Berlanti and based on Becky Albertalli’s young adult novel, “Love, Simon” is supremely ordinary. It goes by the book, tracking the young adult fiction plot with its cast of familiar stock figures: a kooky vice principal who tries too hard (Tony Hale), a pair of affectionate parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel), a childhood best friend (a post-“13 Reasons Why” Katherine Langford), an insecure yet simultaneously flamboyant theater kid (Logan Miller). There’s a Halloween pool party and a homecoming game, a school musical and an unofficial senior skip day. At first, it seems like Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker’s screenplay tries to tick off YA tropes like checklist boxes.
But that ordinariness is actually what’s most revolutionary about “Love, Simon”: its unoriginality a surprising asset. So many LGBT narratives end in suicide, hate crimes, ostracism, or heartbreak (looking at you, tearful Timothée Chalamet in a fireplace)—unhappy endings. “Love Simon” subverts the tropes of both gay movies and teen movies by synthesizing genres, borrowing the best parts of each: the teen movie imbued with the pathos and gravitas of the coming out narrative, and the coming out narrative made heartwarming and tender by the simplicity of teen movie tropes. The affectionate parents, the cute kid sister, and the funny, caring friends are all stock characters, but maybe that familiarity is what a film like this—the first mainstream studio film with a gay protagonist—demands. “Love, Simon” is sweet, but never cloyingly so. Touching, but not saccharine. Funny, without ever trying too hard.
That’s not to say Simon’s coming out story is all rainbows and butterflies. In the age of Internet anonymity, rumors find their own insidious corner of the web, and students in high school—the veritable kingdom of misinformation and interpersonal drama—wield those secrets like currency. Online anonymity is the catalyst for Simon to branch out and make a connection, but it’s also the forum for trading personal attacks and cruel memes of classmates’ embarrassing moments. The most crushing scenes (the leaking of Simon’s secret and its immediate aftermath) serve as a brutal reminder that what’s online might seem like inconsequential chatter, but its real-life implications reverberate permanently. (Worth mentioning, too, is Robinson in the lead role, who portrays Simon as adeptly in his misery as in his joy.) Like “Dear Evan Hansen,” last year’s Tony Best musical about an introverted high schooler who fabricates a friendship with a bullied classmate, “Love, Simon” examines the effects of technology—both its connective power and the devastating results of its misuse.
But perhaps what “Love, Simon” does most deftly is not grand, thematic gestures, but simple moments, imbued poignantly with truth. During a sleepover, the camera hovers above Simon and Leah sprawled on his bed, their silhouettes spatially complementary like yin and yang. “Sometimes I feel like I’m destined to care so much about one person it nearly kills me,” Leah, Simon’s best friend, says. The lines border on schmaltz, but it’s a believable kind of sentiment—after all, what kind of teenager doesn’t feel everything all at once? It’s refreshing, too, to see characters feel so deeply and authentically, and to engage with each other so humanly. The movie is a reminder of what it feels like to trade secrets over a sleepover, or to care too much, or to fall—hopelessly, wondrously, frighteningly—in love for the first time.

It seems that every time a prominent rapper is arrested, social media sites are inundated with hashtags advocating for that artist’s freedom. Recently,Twitter and Instagram users have begun to post demands such as, “#freetayk,” or “freeherbo,” or “freeyoungboy.” But all of these rappers were arrested for serious crimes—ranging from kidnapping and sexual assault, to the unlawful possession of unlicensed, loaded, firearms—for which there was an abundance of evidence. The fact that these individuals are famous artists does not and should not give them free reign to break the law as they see fit.
One recently popularized hashtag, however, remains distinct from the others. On Nov. 6, 2017, a judge sentenced Meek Mill to two to four years of prison time, with two years without the possibility of parole. Soon, the hashtag #freemeekmill began to appear on various social media platforms. Meek Mill was arrested on two separate occasions in 2017, once for fighting and once for “popping wheelies”—recklessly riding an illegal bike. He has been unfairly penalized for both crimes—especially considering that both charges were later dropped. To be fair, the reasoning behind the harsh sentence was that these crimes violated his probation, which he received as a consequence of an earlier arrest. But this earlier arrest occurred over a decade ago in 2007, when Meek Mill was just 19 years old. The artist is now 30, and since serving eights months of prison time for his crime in 2007, he has continued to suffer for his offense in the form of an exorbitantly lengthy probation, a situation that would likely not be the case were he not black.
“If his name was John Smith, he wouldn’t be in jail and he certainly wouldn’t be on probation,” Meek Mill’s attorney said to CNN last November, suggesting that this undeserved treatment likely stemmed from racial biases. To put Meek Mill’s sentence in context, in 2015 white Division I swimmer Brock Allen Turner was arrested for the sexual assault of an unconscious student—a crime much more malicious than Meek Mill’s unlawful drug and firearm possession. Like Meek Mill, Turner was 19, but the swimmer was given six months of jail time, followed by a probation term of just three years.
Since Meek Mill’s 2007 arrest, he has earned many accolades for his music, and has amassed a great deal of wealth. But even this success has not shielded him from the institutionalized prejudices of the judicial system. These injustices influence his fans as well. Part of the beauty of rap music, in addition to its entertainment value, lies in rare efficacy as a medium through which underprivileged black youth can see other black Americans at the top of the economic totem pole. Music is one of the few lucrative occupations in which black people have adequate representation. For inner-city kids in circumstances similar to rappers before they achieved fame, these artists demonstrate that with hard work, they too can attain economic success.
This vision is shattered once a teenager’s mistake continues to condemn him years later. And if becoming one of modern rap’s most successful artists is not enough to overcome a mistake made in one’s youth, it is difficult to imagine what could be. Meek Mill’s sentence is therefore egregiously unjust not only to him personally, but also to black youth who see him as an example of achievement. By delivering unjust punishments to Meek Mill, a role model for many inner-city black youth, the judicial system further depletes these children’s hope for the attainment of success.
The exorbitant rates of incarceration of black Americans is an issue that needs urgently to be remedied. Meek Mill’s celebrity status amplifies this issue, and demonstrates that not even affluence can fully shield black Americans from these problems. There is hope, however, that speaking out against such wrongs may eventually effect institutional change. For the sake of this change, and for the sake of Meek Mill, let’s keep these hashtags trending.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a certain ease with which one may praise Armando Iannucci’s “The Death of Stalin.” It ticks the boxes of what should make a compelling film. Much like his previous work in political comedy—including the sublime “The Thick of It” and the Emmy Award-winning “Veep”—it is bathed in Iannucci’s wit. The dialogue and details are precise. It is uproariously amusing—far funnier than a film with its sheer quantity of institutionalized murder should be.
The work is a delicate exploration of power and cruelty, set on the backdrop of Stalin’s death, funeral, and the ensuing struggle for primacy between Moscow Party head Nikita Khrushchev (Steve Buscemi) and secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria (Simon Russell Beale). We know who wins—Khrushchev would become the first secretary of the Soviet Union during the coldest years of the cold war; Beria, alternatively, was shot. The potency of the narrative does not derive from the surprise of its plot. Instead, “The Death of Stain” is interested in the absurdity of human interaction played out on the scale of a vast government bureaucracy.
This is the film in its most compelling state. “The Death of Stalin” treats each character—from the powerful to the subjugated—as individuals making human decisions. Joseph Stalin (an uneven Adrian McLoughlin), despite the weight of his actions, is simply a man. Like other men, when he has a stroke, he becomes incontinent. Like other men, he heartily laughs at good and bad jokes. He is part of the mediocre masses.
Through Iannucci’s careful satirical eye, unfettered belief in a leader (from prime ministers to presidents to general secretaries) is reduced to an act of theological absurdity. Even the most malevolent acts of state control—and “The Death of Stalin” depicts the gauntlet—are simply products of inserting the natural capriciousness of human emotion into a bureaucratic apparatus that enables their dissemination over the powerless public.
It is precisely the ease with which the whims of man become the acts of state that the film intuitively depicts through its flippant treatment of life and death. As Khrushchev and Beria jostle for power, people are summarily shot and children are violated. Nevertheless, Iannucci is careful not to fully submerge the unsettling human consequences of the film’s absurdist political theater. As a man in an execution line is saved by his position in the line and backroom jostling between these politicians, he returns home to the son who sold him out. After a young girl is implied to be molested by Beria, her parents pick her up in the morning.
The imaging here is subtle. There is a vivid human drama delicately alluded to off-screen that must be pieced together by our imagination. It is not the film’s story to tell—that lies in the machinations of power. Unlike the leaders it depicts, the film is aware of the human cost of political action (the treacherous son; the girl and her family). It maintains a balance between alluding towards the pain of the public and depicting the frivolity with which human life is treated by these (regretfully humorous) individuals.
The mere fact that the film is an intellectually compelling depiction of power should not suppress the fact that this representation appears in a richly funny frame. Iannucci has an astute eye for the absurd. In the opening moments of “The Death of Stalin,” the titular Stalin requests a recorded copy of the evening’s performance of Mozart after the unrecorded concert concludes, impelling the acquisition of a bed-clothed conductor, audience members from the city street, and a several thousand ruble bribe. As Stalin falls ill, our cast of characters find themselves at a loss for which doctors to call. All the good doctors are imprisoned or dead, “We have all the doctors! There is no second opinion.” The film’s smaller scenes are similarly littered with comic details. Beria and Khrushchev, in their unhealthful sedentary glory, race to greet and curry favor with Stalin’s daughter, Svetlana Stalina (a wonderful Andrea Riseborough). A lamp is misplaced on a chair. Khrushchev is reduced to picking the pleats on the curtains for Stalin’s funeral.
As may be implied by the effusive praise above, “The Death of Stalin” is an easier piece to laud than to criticize. This does not mean that this is a good film. Its faults are more understated: There is something subtly disconnected and feckless about its comedic vignettes; the film lacks a spiritual center. A usually wonderful Buscemi is amusing enough as Khrushchev. Nevertheless, his performance lacks the magnetism of Iannucci’s other leading muses. The blame cannot be simply saddled on Buscemi—the lines given to the film’s less central characters lack the full force of Iannucci’s wit. Many of these individuals, including Vyacheslav Molotov (Michael Palin), Anastas Mikoyan (Paul Whitehouse), and Nikolai Bulganin (Paul Chahidi), are unfocused and indistinct sketches. Even worse, others (including Rupert Friend’s Vasily Stalin) never exceed their farcical trappings.
Unlike Iannucci’s previous political efforts, “The Death of Stalin” seems detached from the spirit of its setting. “Veep” and “The Thick of It” derive part of their potency from their symbiotic relationship with place. Alternatively, the film simply treats the Soviet Union as an excuse to explore farcical absurdity of power rather than endowing the setting with a distinct sense of place. This effect is only heightened by aspects of the film’s historical inaccuracy. (Many of these inaccuracies do not matter, such as the compression of various historical events. Some of them do matter, such as the willful glossing of the fact that the “good” doctors were incarcerated primarily because of antisemitism.)
It is not solely the glib treatment with which the film treats Moscow that is deeply problematic—the lack of wide-ranging intellectual curiosity is also worrisome. At his best, Iannucci’s work simultaneously probes a plurality of subjects. “The Thick of It,” for example, works equally well as an exploration of gender politics as it does an exploration of British politics (if the two can be separated). Here, “The Death of Stalin” lacks a second gear. That is not to say that the film is not funny and intellectually compelling—it is certainly both—yet it lacks a sublime breath of beauty that separates great art from the mediocre masses. In this sense, “The Death of Stalin” is much like the leaders it depicts.

“Gringo” is the Spanish word for foreigner. They’re usually American, white, and easy to spot in a crowd. The word can be used as a pejorative or as a humorous tag for clueless tourists. At any rate, a gringo cannot be expected to understand Hispanic culture, its rules, and its customs. In the case of Harold Soyinka (David Oyelowo), his innocence puts him at a distinct disadvantage compared to his more attuned, cosmopolite associates.
Harold is a gringo in two ways. An immigrant from Nigeria, Harold works for an American pharmaceutical company, assigned to operations in Mexico. He is a friendly man, a hard worker, a supportive husband, and an utterly oblivious victim of his boss’s ruthless corporate machinations. In an attempt to save his own livelihood, Harold finds himself in the thick of a multi-sided intrigue between executives, mob bosses, and cutthroats looking to make a quick buck out of the chaos. Director Nash Edgerton tells a classic underdog story through the murky plot, although Oyelowo himself propels the tale through his charming naïveté. The result is some quick, funny entertainment, though it struggles to convey its overarching meaning.
The film gets most of its laughs by contrasting the professional atmosphere of Harold’s workplace with the realities of his life. An innocent trip to Mexico is also a setup for Harold’s termination, an industrial espionage mission, and a drug war skirmish. Successful, professional executives talk trash, sex, and murder on an hourly basis. Scenes in polished, modern buildings suddenly cut into shots of dingy motels and bars. While Harold’s superiors Richard Rusk (Joel Edgerton) and Elaine Markinson (Charlize Theron) nonchalantly plan mergers, Harold is on the run from drug cartels. The atmosphere throughout the film is flippant and thoroughly irreverent to all parties involved.
At the same time, the people in power, both in the United States and Mexico, are clearly monsters. Both the company and the cartel are lying, backstabbing, cheating scum. People who claim to help Harold end up trying to capture him, and people who are told to kill him end up saving him. The sheer number of plot twists and double-crosses in the film, while certainly uproarious, needlessly complicates the plot. Harold finds out that his “friend” Richard is planning to sell him out of his job, so he fakes his kidnapping to get some insurance money. All goes well until, in a stroke of comedy, Harold finds out that his insurance policy is nonexistent, and he really is kidnapped by a drug cartel. From here on, the movie descends into utter chaos. In his defense, Oyelowo does an admirable job portraying the lighthearted, simple-minded Harold, a role that speaks to his versatility, given his far grittier role as Martin Luther King in “Selma.” Harold’s exaggerated simple-mindedness makes for a refreshing contrast to the absolute snarl of plotlines.
But integrity is not enough to save Harold, as the film makes it quite clear that nice guys finish last. Harold’s greatest enemy is not the executive establishment, nor the criminal network, but his own purity of character. He stumbles over his words, fails to notice a single one of his betrayers, and escapes pursuers by sheer force of plot. He is an outsider, a “no-account official” in the financial world and the “black gringo” in Mexico. Harold recalls his father’s guide to success before he came to America: “You work hard, and you follow the rules.” The USA was meant to be a land of opportunity, where honest, hardworking people can make a living. Instead, the world runs by Rusk’s philosophy of “You want something? You go out there and fucking take it.” Life is inherently unfair.
At this point, the film jumps off the comedy train to take a jab at the corrupt paths to power. Harold tells the story of when he first started working under Rusk. They were playing a friendly chess game, and Harold saw an opening for an easy checkmate. Yet he did not take it. Why? As he says, “You do not beat the boss.” There are countless hidden, arbitrary rules to success, in crime as well as in business. The prominent drug lord in Mexico, nicknamed Black Panther (Carlos Corona), interrogates his visitors with the life-or-death question of “Do you like the Beatles?” Those who answer unsatisfactorily are promptly shot.
To come out on top, Harold is forced to engage in a bit of deception of his own. He may have lost his career, his wife, and his friendships, but in exchange he seizes a chance to start his life fresh. He seeks to disappear, and in the process leads Rusk and his potential captors on a wild-goose chase through the streets of Mexico. But what sets him and his brand of deception apart from the people he seeks vengeance on? The movie seeks to explain this in a rare moment of clarity, when ex-mercenary Mitch (Sharlto Copley) poses an ethical dilemma to Harold: Why  is Judas Iscariot, a man who repents and punishes himself for his sins, more reviled than Peter, a man who denies the Christ three times? Harold replies, “Judas was motivated by money, but Peter faced a crisis of the soul.”
Presumably, Harold is different from Rusk or the Black Panther in this morality: He sees his dishonesty as a character flaw, while the others merely see profit. It is this recognition of his own faults that makes Harold a better and ultimately more honest man. Life is not fair, and success will nearly inevitably fall to the undeserving. But according to “Gringo,” even the outsiders can find their place in the world if they play a game with higher stakes than money.

Although it received little critical or popular acclaim upon its release in 1998, “The Big Lebowski,” one of the Coen brothers’ most iconic films—much like how its beloved antihero, a self-described “deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won’t give a shit about”—“abides.”
A stoner comedy (very) loosely based on the film noir “The Big Sleep,” “The Big Lebowski” simultaneously occupies several conventionally incongruous modes and genres, while bringing together a cast of characters so eclectic that they seem to belong in different movies. Its plot, which mirrors that of “The Big Sleep” in its convolutedness, has served as a point of contention for certain critics. Even the soundtrack, from Bob Dylan to Mozart (NOT the Eagles), appears to be in disarray. Yet in spite—or perhaps because—of all these apparent contradictions, which have inspired an equally diverse reception in the two decades since its release, the film’s popularity seems destined to continue to increase with the complication of each passing year.
Perhaps, as “Lebowski” fanatic Jonathan Chait of New York Magazine argues, “The Big Lebowski” seems to improve with every viewing because, not in spite, of its contradictory features. Indeed, once you no longer have to keep track of the plot in order to follow along, you begin to notice more and more of its brilliant details—the comedy of politically correct word choice, for instance, as the brilliant John Goodman’s Walter corrects the Dude on his use of the word “Chinaman” (“Also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature, uh… Asian-American. Please”). He subsequently uses it himself a few lines later (“THE CHINAMAN IS NOT THE ISSUE, DUDE”), after which the word is picked up by the billionaire (“Big”) Jeffrey Lebowski. But why stop there? The joke is refracted in the Dude’s later, passing self-correction, as he refers to his signature beverage, a White Russian, as a “Caucasian.”
The film also gets better and better when regarded from the perspective provided by the Coen Brothers’ later movies, which retrospectively suggest new possible interpretations, as if the Brothers were teaching us to “read.” Considered with respect to their films’ immersion not only in classic film genres but in Classical and Old Testament characters and mythologies, a whole new range of possible allegorical interpretations becomes available. (Here I join the ranks of medievalist Andrew Rabin, who sees the saga of the Dude as an adaptation of the quest for the Holy Grail, the aforementioned Chait, who by 2013 decided the movie was best understood as an allegory for the fiscal cliff, and any viewer who hears Odysseus in George Clooney’s smooth-talking escaped con, Orpheus in Oscar Isaacs’ lament-filled folksinger, or Job in Michael Stuhlbarg’s Midwestern physics professor hoping for tenure.) Considered in light of these newer films, John Goodman, whose towering, glass-eyed thug is the perfect Polyphemus in “O Brother Where Art Thou” seems to be the Ajax to the Dude’s self-sidelining Achilles (the “rug” that “pulled the whole room together,” his Achilles heel…?) in “The Big Lebowski.”
Or maybe the movie refuses to become dated because its setting in time is complicated by anachronisms. Although the Dude is described as “the man for his time and place,” and the movie, like its hero, is firmly located in 1990s Los Angeles, as Christopher Orr notes, the film is bizarrely involved with the past: its music is largely from the ’60s and ’70s, one of its main characters won’t stop talking about Vietnam, its bowling alleys are evocative of the ’50s, and the narrator, played by Sam Elliot, belongs in a golden-age Western from the first half of the twentieth century.  In fact, very little in the movie is as it seems to be. Almost every character is revealed to be the opposite of what they initially appear: Walter, the war vet who doesn’t “roll on shabbos,” is a Polish Catholic still enamored with his Jewish ex-wife, the supposedly self-made billionaire “Big Lebowski” owes his success and fortune to his daughter and his former wife, and his current wife, the porn-star “Bunny,” is in fact a farmgirl from Minnesota.
Maybe, finally, “The Big Lebowski” at 20 is both a cult hit and cinematic classic because its craziness never ceases to surprise us: Like the Dude snared by a case of mistaken identity, we can never quite get to the bottom of it, or reinstate the “rug that pulls it all together” again.

Nothing says, “Welcome to medieval Bohemia,” quite like a swordfight where you are outnumbered, in poor health, and fighting for not only your own survival, but for the survival of the kingdom. This is a scenario you will encounter numerous times throughout your journey in “Kingdom Come: Deliverance,” and it never gets old. Balancing proper rest, food (and alcohol) consumption, skill training, side quests, and main quests can often feel burdensome, but the tension and realism that “KC:D” brings to the table makes it all worth it.
“KC:D” is an open world role-playing game from developer Warhorse Studios. You are dropped into medieval Bohemia, a kingdom of the Holy Roman Empire in the heart of Europe. Upon the death of acclaimed Emperor Charles IV, his son, Wenceslas, inherits the throne. Wenceslas is not nearly the beloved ruler that his father was, and his half-brother Sigismund wants to claim the throne for himself. As the King of Hungary, Sigismund commands an army that descends on Bohemia, attempting to wrestle the kingdom away from Wenceslas. When this war reaches your doorstep in the town of Skalitz, you are forced to embark on a journey that will change your life. “KC:D”’s story is compelling, emotional, and based on great historical research. The world Warhorse Studios has created is rich with detail. From the NPCs to the dialogue options to the visual fidelity, there are aspects of a AAA game present here.
Although the combat is difficult, it is one of the most rewarding systems of any game in recent memory. Mastering it takes legitimate practice and effort, and even seasoned RPG players will likely have a rough time adapting. “KC:D” does not waste any time with the basics, either. Within the first half-hour of the story the player is tasked with getting money back from the town drunkard, and things get violent. This is one of the greatest aspects of “KC:D.” It does not hold the player’s hand. The player is not constantly reminded of their objective. Instead, the game gives the player the freedom to do as they please and tackle the quests when and if they feel like it. Coupled with the intense realism of the combat mechanics and the extreme historical accuracy, the game is extremely immersize. The characters are deep and engaging, allowing for real relationships complicated by tough choices. Placing the responsibility of decision-making on the player rather than the story’s writers adds depth and meaning to every encounter. Thanks to the complexity of the game’s mechanics and its narrative freedom, it is possible for each player to have an entirely unique playthrough. All these factors combine to make “Kingdom Come: Deliverance” an incredibly compelling game.
The game isn’t perfect, though. Its pacing is slow, and most players who are used to modern RPGs may not feel like they are accomplishing enough. This game requires patience, planning, and dedication. With a main questline that, according to the developers, takes between 30 and 50 hours to complete, it is no cake-walk. Factor in the side quests and all the balancing previously mentioned, and you are in for hundreds of hours of gameplay. With that in mind, this is a game that you should really be ready to sink your teeth into. The combat system is intentionally difficult and requires considerable effort to become proficient with. You will die countless times, and the atrocious save system “KC:D” implements is no help.
In an attempt to be more realistic, the game only auto-saves on the completion of quests. There are only two other ways to save the game: drink “Saviours Schnapps,” something hard to come by early on which costs valuable Groschen, the in-game currency; or find a bed in which to sleep. Rather than adding depth, the save mechanic often takes away from the otherwise engrossing gameplay by forcing the player to constantly consider how much of the game will need to be replayed if they cannot save. Saving is by far the most topical of annoyances in this expansive game. The inclusion of so many systems means that at least one was bound to be more infuriating than engaging.
In "KC:D," that system is lockpicking. The lockpicking design in “KC:D” is infuriating. Not only are the lockpicks themselves hard to come by early on, but the act of lockpicking is no fun at all. To put things into perspective, two of the most popular mods for “KC:D” make changes to the saving and lockpicking. Aside from these two specific qualms, the game is just generally buggy. Frequent crashing and poor optimization leads to an experience that could have been so much more.
Ultimately, “Kingdom Come: Deliverance” has a lot of potential. Warhorse Studios has been vocal about working to fix issues that players are having, and with a few changes it can be a top-tier RPG. “KC:D” is similar to the earlier games in the “Elder Scrolls” series mixed with the complexity and brutality of “Dark Souls.” If you like open-world RPGs and are looking for one to sink hundreds of hours into, “Kingdom Come: Deliverance” should be your next purchase.

Boom, boom, boom. Or should I say bump, bump, bump? Three Kardashian pregnancy announcements within six months is unprecedented and—by my very reliable, AP Stat-backed calculations—highly improbable. I believe I can safely say that few were asking for one more K-spawn, let alone three. So how did this happen? As an occasional “KUWTK” binger, teenage American girl, and citizen of Earth, I consider myself well-qualified to weigh in on this shocking phenomenon.
Naturally, one’s first thought is that this is all the brainchild of Kris Jenner, who is Mother of All PR. In fact, it’s easy to imagine how she might have conceived this Kardashian baby boom: “Okay, team meeting! Line up! Kylie and Khloe step forward. You are both to drop contraception right now. Kim, there are these things called surrogates. Go, go, go!”
It is definitely more fair and humane to reject that Kris has control over her daughters’ reproductive choices. This solution is also just too obvious, so let’s examine the timeline here. On Sep. 6, 2017, news broke that Kim and Kanye’s surrogate was indeed pregnant. No big surprise here—we’d known since June that they were surrogate-searching. Weeks later on Sep. 22, reports surfaced that Kylie was also expecting. If the world’s sanity were a pregnancy, this news would be the equivalent of feeling the first kick. Days later, rumors of Khloe’s pregnancy also spread.
The key lies in Kylie and Khloe’s delivery due dates. Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie and Travis Scott, was born on Feb. 1, 2018, and nine months prior to this date is the tail end of spring. Meanwhile, Khloe is reportedly due sometime in March, meaning that time of conception was likely at the end of spring or start of summer. Could these simultaneous sibling pregnancies simply be the product of Mother Nature’s seasonal breeding decree? Though it is impossible to know for certain, it’s enticing to believe that even Kardashian-Jenners are susceptible to spring fever.
How exactly the K(-J)lan chooses its baby names is an investigation for another time. However, for your reading pleasure and because you need this in your life, I’ve included my definitive ranking of Kardashian baby names:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With over half of the “Witness” tour and an “American Idol” judgeship under her belt, Katy Perry is having a relatively good run during what has been an era plagued by questionable marketing decisions. Still, while her growth is commendable, the new Katy has left fans feeling as though something is missing. In the midst of an album cycle hell-bent on depriving the general public of the catchy earworms the pop star is known for (justice for “Roulette”!), it’s important that we take a step back to reflect on her past success and acknowledge that, just half a decade ago, Katy was delivering Billboard #1’s left and right.
5. “E.T.”Placing a song as thoroughly enjoyable as “E.T.” at the bottom of this list is a testament to the strength of the “Teenage Dream” era. Featuring Kanye West in what, with hindsight goggles on, might seem like a harbinger of feuds to come, “E.T.” is about as far out as the then-mainstream Katy gets. This track marries Katy’s generally upbeat style with heavy production: Her lyrics are layered with rattling backing percussion, and her already-breathy vocals are stretched and altered. A pleasant song on most accounts, “E.T.” finds itself at the bottom of the list both because of its largely unnecessary rap feature and because of its adherence to a niche, intergalactic theme that makes the song’s content just a tad less universal.
4. “Firework”Katy’s song “Firework” leaves one yearning for the so-called “pop-timism” of the late 2000s and early 2010s. While certainly not original in its subject matter, “Firework” nevertheless markets itself as both authentic and compelling. Surprisingly, it manages to pull this off. Showcasing lyrical gems like “do you ever feel like a plastic bag,” this single mobilizes the unwieldy metaphors Katy is so fond of without coming off as cliché. With minimalism and indie-pop now in vogue, “Firework” is a reminder of the power that a properly conceived, unapologetic pop anthem can have.
3. “Last Friday Night”In a world fraught with the serious, “Last Friday Night” reminds us that sometimes, it’s alright to forget about maturity. The song’s temporally inconsistent references to bars and barbecues makes the single widely accessible to listeners in all legs of young adulthood. The song is tastefully throwback-ish, with a high point of the tune being the saxophone solo in the bridge. That’s not to say that the song has aged perfectly: References to things being “epic fails,” for example, date the song a bit more than the songwriters may have intended. All things considered, however, the anachronisms add a certain messy charm to the track.
2. “California Gurls”Katy’s debut single off of “Teenage Dream” and its corresponding music video take the term “bubblegum pop” to a whole new level. Originally written as a rebuttal to Alicia Keys and Jay-Z’s “Empire State of Mind,” this track is anything but combative. “California Gurls” is the quintessential carefree summer jam, a reminder to us listeners that it’s always sunny out somewhere. And while Snoop Dogg’s feature on this track isn’t volumes more cohesive than Kanye’s on E.T., there’s an undeniable camaraderie between the artists that works.
1. “Teenage Dream”The crown goes, of course, to the title track of the album. As close as we’ll likely ever get to pop perfection, “Teenage Dream” is a genre-definer. More West Coast road trip than song, this single effortlessly blends both nostalgia and unbridled excitement into just-under-four minutes of bliss. It’s this effervescent, starry-eyed Katy who first enraptured a generation. While Katy’s current musical endeavors have left some listeners scratching their heads, I’d argue that these efforts further immortalize “Teenage Dream” era. Ephemeral and unforgettable, the album and its lead singles are a perfect encapsulation of youth’s fast-fleeting exuberance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten student performances will be competing for two spots to open for this year’s Yardfest headliner. While the battle is set for Mar. 22, The Harvard Crimson caught up with some of the bands to talk about their music and what they’re excited for.
NEW DAKOTAS
This four-man band plays a diverse range of music including folk, pop, rock, and indie. “We’re going to try really hard to be very engaging with the audience,” band member Chris G. Haley ’19 said. “And also, we’re going to play an original song.” This song, “Walking on Air,” is from New Dakota’s EP, which will be released in April according to Haley.
21 COLORFUL CRIMSON
When asked about this group, founder James A. Mathew ’21 said, “21 Colorful Crimson, a.k.a. 21 CC, is a musical group of 21 Harvard freshmen. The group isn’t just musicians—we have singers, rappers, producers, but also film crew and a business team.” Mathew also said that 21 CC aims to donate revenue generated from future performances and sales to charity. “In everything we do, we’re always looking to spread… our fundamental themes, which are creativity, inclusion, and love,” Mathew said. “We try to use our music as a vehicle for spreading those three things.”
SOFT STAR
This trio of Harvard students performs original music that is self-described as “folk psychedelic rock DIY punky soul trance,” and utilizes a variety of instruments from the guitar, to the fiddle, to the bucket drum. Despite the group’s name, Soft Star’s Facebook page reads, “We aren't soft or stars yet, but we're working on it.”
LUKE MARTINEZ
One of the few stand-alone artists, Luke A. Martinez ’19 will also be performing at the Battle with the hope of landing the chance to open at Yardfest. They will be performing an original song, but is not revealing its name early in order to surprise the audience. “I’m excited because I think a lot of people don’t know exactly what my music sounds like and they’re going to get a chance to hear it at full potency,” Martinez said.
AVANTI NAGRAL ’20, ALAISHA SHARMA ’20, MARGARET CANADY ’20
Avanti Nagral ’20 grew up surrounded by rhythm. With a background in broadway, Sufi, gospel, soul, Bollywood, and pop, Nagral is one of the first students to pursue a dual degree from Harvard and Berklee College of Music. For the Yardfest lineup, she will be singing alongside dancers Alaisha Sharma ’20 and Margaret Canady ’20. “My professional start was in theater, and I try to incorporate elements of different performing arts whenever I perform,” Nagral said. At Harvard, Nagral has performed at Arts First, Cultural Rhythms, Cambridge Queen’s Head, Ghungroo, and formals and student group events. As for Yardfest, she said that, though she often performs at various venues, she’d love an opportunity to perform for all of Harvard.
TJ AND HURLINK
TJ Song ’20 and Hurlink Vongsachang ’20 were originally just LPSA office-hour buddies. They casually joked about performing together in a Facebook comment about a singing/beatboxing duo this past summer, and when they were in the same area, they gave it a shot. Now, they create mashups together. Vongsachang, an avid beatboxer, is also a co-choreographer for the a capella group the Harvard Lowkeys and performed in the freshman talent show last fall. Song debuted his own song, “Immature,” on YouTube last August. As to what audience members should expect on Thursday?
“I feel like it’d be better as a surprise,” Song said. “Just try to imagine guitar, vocals, and beatboxing coming together into a mashup of popular radio songs.”
JEAN CORONA
In the Battle for Yardfest event page, Jean Corona dubbed themselves as a “four piece cover-band that can never reach consensus.” This group of musicians includes Stephanie Johnson ’18, Nick Pham ’19, Teddy Brokaw ’18, Jeremy Welborn ’19.
SOCIAL COMMITTEE
DJ Alexander D. Kim ’18 and music producer Jason S. Cui ’18 make up the electronic music duo Social Committee. After realizing that they shared a love for electronic music, the pair officially established their team last year. “We started with school events like formals and we progressed up to gigs in the local Boston area,” Cui said. Now the pair hopes to headline Yardfest. “I think people love the music we bring for the same reasons Alex and I like electronic music,” Cui said. It’s super fun to listen to and super energetic.”
THE ELECTRICIANS
Difficult to pin down in style but clear in intention, The Electricians play and cover rock, blues, jazz, reggae, and more, all in the pursuit of two goals. “We’re here for the money, we’re here for the fame. We’re here to have a good time mostly,” guitarist and vocalist Aaron B. Argyres ’18 said. When asked what competitive edge they have for Thursday’s competition, Ian H. McClanan ’20 replied, “I was unaware this was a competition format. I would say mostly sex appeal.”
DISCO BAND!
Disco Band!, the thirteen-person, ’70s inspired disco group began with a joke. “It all started with a group of friends and musicians who would often joke about how disco music is the ultimate dance music, and should logically be the only thing that’s ever played at parties,” Jacques Berguig ’18 said. Soon, that joke turned into a project with over a dozen members. Berguig believes the scope and authenticity of Disco Band! will push his band to victory. “We have a 13-person band, including a horn section and back-up singers, dedicated to capturing the whole feel of the disco and funk era. From Earth, Wind & Fire to ABBA, from the Village People to the Jackson 5, our only purpose is to play whatever will make people dance, so I have no doubt at all that we could show everyone an amazing time.”

UPDATED: March 25, 2018 at 1:50 p.m.
The plot is relatively simple. A woman needs money—fast—in order to pay for her son’s operation. We are in the Congolese city of Kinshasa, where the main character, Félicité, makes her living as a singer.
A foreigner would perhaps see this city as an afterthought, a space left excavated by the scavengings of colonialism. But this is not an ethnographic film. We do not observe passively or find ourselves sentimentalizing the Other. Instead we are displaced, moved, beckoned.
It is Félicité herself who does this beckoning. We do not know what she thinks as she performs again and again at the same restaurant, as she watches bar-goers shake off the frayed edges of their days, floating up to us not unlike those fickle and beautiful Greek gods we know so well. Our mysterious translator of chaos, she sings but is mostly silent in conversation. Sometimes her face—sharp, stubborn, and beautiful, as her eventual lover Tabu reminds us again and again—ripples to reveal a faint glimmer of what it hides. Rather than rendering these inner feelings explicit to the viewer, director Alain Gomis infuses the film with a transcendence that conjures up ancestry, cosmology, and mythology.
What is our place in the universe? What do we do with the soul, especially when it is constrained by the exhausting routines of life? The film does not answer these weighty questions, but it does give them texture and color through image, sound, and silence. Two recurring motifs—a night-time sequence when Félicité makes her way across a dense forest into a body of water, and scenes of a Congolese orchestra and chorus rehearsing—bring forth a second world not so distant from this quotidian one. This constant brushing—more like a careful floating and layering—between the daily and the “other-worldly” evokes something mysterious and sublime, disrupting the film’s straightforward narrative structure in order to return the viewer to their inner self.
This “other-worldliness” elicits not only the ancient and spiritual, but also the depth of the film’s characters, the underlying set of dreams, desires, and myths they hold onto and hope for. Gomis gives his characters time to emerge. He lets them be distant and then close again. Moments of purposeful distance—whether through sound, disquieting silence, or temporal disruption—magnify the expression of each character’s interiority, as well as what we search for when looking at them. They dance within a liminal space where extremes rub up against one another: suffering and joy, release and tension, violence and redemption. They boast when they ought to be humble, and drink when they ought to be sober. They writhe, stumbling through their needs and desires as they grapple with the weight of unexpected trauma.
As we live, there are gaps in how we interpret and move through the world. In the middle of thought a memory appears as a half-dream. Moments tread away from us, moments when we are in conflict with ourselves and cannot catch up or find our way out. Or perhaps we simply find ourselves submarined, the inner content of our experience invisible to everyone else. We notice the frayed edge of a faded Persian rug, a sign of the material world that used to ground us. Suffering ceases, releases itself, picks up again, is both here and gone.
“Félicité” challenges the viewer to consider what occurs after everything breaks down, when plans run amok and options reach their limits. This decisive moment—when the characters must determine if and how they must go on—is where a lesser film would end and where this one truly begins. Constructing a film centered on the question of whether or not life itself is possible is no easy feat. Yet Gomis finds a way to bring to life what we could never possibly find words for, layering the second, third and fourth worlds we cannot easily articulate onto the surface-ones that look most like our non-filmic present.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 25, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly called Kinshasa a Sénégalese city and referenced a Sénégalese orchestra. In fact, Kinsasha is a Congolese city and the orchestra is also Congolese.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 4, award-winning poet and playwright Claudia Rankine sat down to continue a conversation she started with her new play “The White Card” with over 1,000 people in Boston. Presented by fellow collaborator P. Carl at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theater , Rankine’s discussion revolved around her personal experiences and revelations accumulated during both the time she took to write her poetry book “Citizen: An American Lyric” and the world premiere of “The White Card,” which explores racism through the lens of white philanthropy.
Rankine began by revealing the emotional process she underwent writing “Citizen.” “The ‘Citizen’ began with [Hurricane] Katrina,” Rankine said. “When Katrina happened, many people said, ‘How could this happen?’ And it became sort of an irritant for me.” Unlike her peers, Rankine was unsurprised that the entire black community was abandoned after Katrina struck. One of her main purposes for writing “Citizen,” a book of poetry about race and imagination, was to show how microaggressions accumulate, allowing for larger aggressions to develop so that with Katrina oppressed groups felt abandoned after the hurricane took place.
After Rankine was diagnosed with breast cancer, she stayed at home and sifted through moments in the media that caught her imagination. It was during these moments of uninterrupted silence that Rankine was able to think about how to communicate the narratives she had gathered from her background research. She argued that the reason these racialized microaggressions are so often ignored is because the aggressors often forget their actions. But their victims do not. Acknowledging that the targets of this racialized prejudice do not forget such experiences, she made phone calls to friends who had experienced racism in their lives.
Yet Rankine recognized the limits of conveying her friends’ experiences. “That was still hearsay,” she said. To resolve this issue, Rankine sought to include pieces that readers could fact-check, leading her to write a chapter on Serena Williams that documented her history in the U.S. Open where it seemed as if being black caused Serena Williams to be treated unjustly on the court, such as when umpire Mariana Alves made five bad calls against her or when the media pigeonholed her competitive spirit into the stereotype of an “angry black woman.” “I wanted people to say, ‘No, [racism] doesn’t happen,’ and then go to Youtube and see that people cannot help but project onto black people ideas around criminality,” Rankine said.

The Boston Opera House’s new show “Parts In Suite,” which is showing at the Boston Opera until Apr. 7, demonstrates exactly what a treasure the company is: A group of extremely talented dancers who capture attention and perform technically challenging pieces while synthesizing many different styles of ballet and contrasting music. Their new show for the spring season, “Parts in Suite,” is composed of three very different pieces: “Bach Cello Suites” by Jorma Elo, “In Creases” by Justin Peck, and “Pas/Parts 2018” by William Forsythe. Though the themes and styles of the pieces do not coincide in theme, it is the vast differences which make the show so captivating.
“Bach Cello Suites” begins with cellist Sergey Antonov seated on stage. He is on the side in black with a spotlight shining brightly. After several measures of Bach’s music, other dancers join him. There are four women and four men in black who partner off into pairs, dancing together in formations comprised of lines and diagonals. The choreography is filled with suspended lifts coupled with twirls and arabesques. Though the music was written centuries ago, it is almost as if it were designed with the dancing in mind. When the dancers drag their partners across the floor, they swiftly spin them back up so that all levels are used. Over the course of the performance, dancers dip in and out, leaving some to duets and others to solos. The piece is characterized by canons that revisit earlier motifs weaved in throughout the dance.
While female and male dancers all evoke the necessary amount of turbulent emotion and demonstrate the technical skill needed for this piece, Misa Kuranaga stands out with her soft, sinusoidal movements, every single part performed with such purpose that it seems that her very steps symbolize the notes of the song. Antonov is likewise worthy of additional praise, playing with great feeling and control so that he doesn’t overpower the dancers, but makes the music feel just as important. Above them hangs a bamboo installation that looks like a hashtag. It slowly descends over the course of piece as if to entrap the dancers. While the purpose of this is not clear, it does not detract from the wonderful dancing and music.
Peck’s piece also sizzles. It features live music by pianists Alex Foaksman and Freda Locker, who are seated at a double-ended piano playing from the first and third movements of Philip Glass’s melancholy “Four Movements for Two Pianos.” This music is filled with so many back and forths that it sometimes sounds like a dialogue. The stage remains largely bare as before, while the white light remains soft. The dance features four male and four female dancers again, this time dressed in white. Peck’s choreography is marked with antithesis, full of pushing and pulling. Rather than forming pairs, the dancers form groups of three and four often with one person leading the others. There are fewer canons in this piece than in the one before. These are replaced with more synchronization, which the dancers execute marvelously. The piece is also saturated with jumps. Those performed by dancer Irlan Silva are particularly light, high, and graceful. A lovely performance overall, which delivers its promise of exploring the tension between unison and counterpoint.
For Forsythe’s multipart suite, the stage is given a white background which makes the performers stand out. It features six female and seven male dancers, several of whom have been in the previous dances. The costumes are again simple unitards and tights, but this time include bright jewel-tone colors. The soundtrack features an unlikely mixture of synths, rewinded Latin music and jungle noises, electronic beats, and augmented Mongolian throat-singing that doesn’t entirely match the dancing.
The choreography is less organized, dancers flitting across stage to cover 20 different small parts covering anything from solos to groups of six. Each part is performed with a strong attitude and fierceness. The dancing is filled with contortions. It focuses on contractions and rolling hips. Though the pieces are disconnected, they accumulate movements from other parts such that the dance feels like a literalization of thoughts, following the way half-formed thoughts merge to become a new idea entirely. This repetition is not only clever, but engaging. Chyrstyn Fentroy and Paulo Arrais particularly shine, dancing with a charisma and energy that completely internalizes the beat of the esoteric soundtrack.
“Parts in Suite” is a delightful start to the Boston Ballet’s spring season. While the choreography is in itself engaging, the performances are delivered almost flawlessly.

Best Overall: Mather House
Mather’s video, featuring a rap based on Cardi B’s “Bartier Cardi,” is a joy to watch. Its cinematography is not only impressive—especially right at the beginning—but is also tastefully so, rarely claiming the spotlight. The focus stays on the two charismatic frontwomen, who rap with increasing authority as the video goes on and deliver some of the year’s best burns on other houses: “Lev, you a wannabe Mather.” Throw in a cameo by Louie of Louie’s Suprette (a convenience store next to Mather), and you have all the makings of a winner. Maybe getting Mather isn’t so bad, after all.

Best Cinematography: Dunster House
The cinematography of the Dunster video is hands-down the best of the year––hardly a surprise from the house that brought us a dazzling “La La Land”-inspired video last year and an equally impressive “Star Wars” parody the year before. It’s difficult not to marvel at the time and effort that surely went into this “Holding out for a Hero” parody. The choreography is also beautifully planned and executed, and the combination of exciting camerawork and beautiful dancing should keep you engaged for the duration of the video.

Best Cinematography Runner-up: Pforzheimer House
The Pfoho video, inspired by the Netflix series “Stranger Things,” has great cinematography as well—probably second-best to Dunster. As one of the few videos this year that does not center around a song, it deserves accolades for that unconventional choice, particularly since all of this year’s other non-musical videos become boring before they end (more on them later). Unlike its counterparts, Pfoho’s video is riveting from start to finish.

Best Celebrity Homage: Eliot
Anyone who’s seen an interview with Cardi B can imagine what entertaining thing she’d say if she learned that Harvard students lifted not one, but two of her songs for their Housing Day videos this year. Maybe she’d repeat her frank assessment of her fiancé’s marriage proposal: “It’s the right thing to do.” And if she learned that the two Cardi-inspired videos were among the year’s best, maybe she’d make one of her signature wordless sounds. “Bodak Eliot," based on “Bodak Yellow,” has strong choreography. And its star––decked out in full Cardi B regalia––has an exceptionally compelling presence on screen. Like Mather’s video, the aforementioned one based on another Cardi B song, the Eliot video gets in some good digs at other houses: “I don’t bother with the Quad, don’t let Quincy bother me."

Worst Theme: Quincy
At six minutes, “Fly Quincy” is the longest of this year’s videos, and it really should not be. Sure, Quincy House probably has enough cool features to fill hours of footage, but that’s not the point. A good Housing Day video is entertaining, but this one is merely informative, with some bungled attempts at entertainment. For instance, the phrase “Fly Quincy” comes off as nothing more than proof that someone in Quincy had seen the “Fly Emirates” ad campaign. Good for them! Seriously, though, what is the point of the air travel motif? Is it supposed to be funny? On the bright side, I’d never seen the inside of the Quincy Cube library before, and it was cool to get a glimpse.


Worst Effort: Adams
The creatively titled “Adams Housing Day Video 2018” serves to convey one piece of information: Adams is very close to the Yard. It’s hard to disagree that Yard proximity is a desirable feature in a house, and Adams is probably the closest house to many parts of the Yard, but this video accomplishes nothing besides getting that point across. The overwhelming impression is that its creators were not trying too hard.

Worst Impression of Billy Joel: Kirkland
Much like “Fly Quincy,” it’s difficult to tell what this video is aiming for. It is based on an unofficial 2014 Kirkland video, in which students chanted “Kirkland House, Kirkland House” to the tune of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire” while a “slideshow” comprised of one unimpressive picture of Kirkland played.  While that video was a minimalist masterpiece that made a virtue out of ostentatiously low effort levels, this one tries a bit too hard for it to have the same effect.  It has coherent lyrics and an actual multi-photo slideshow, which suggests that it is not aiming for slacker funniness, but nothing in the video is compelling enough to make it anything but a tone-deaf imitation of past greatness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What do people even do during sex? Could they read a book to make the time go by?”
One of my classmates asked this during our sexual education unit in eighth grade. Our health teacher replied that most couples might kiss or talk. By that point in my life, I’d seen enough rom-coms (read: averted my eyes through enough PG-13 almost-sex scenes) to understand that sex could be fun for certain people. But, looking back, I can see how my classmate missed that and interpreted it as a boring activity solely for reproduction. Not once in our entire unit were we told that sex could be pleasurable or why anyone would want to have sex outside of baby-making.
The key takeaway from my middle school sexual education experience was that sex occurs when a man inserts his penis into a woman’s vagina, and that it can lead to babies. Even though this is a true statement in certain contexts, it doesn’t encompass the full diversity of genders, sexualities, bodies, and experiences. We do students a great disservice if we end the discussion there.
The incomplete and biased information I received in sexual education is reflective of a national trend. Only 24 states mandate sexual education, and of those 24, only 13 mandate that sex or HIV education be medically accurate. While 37 states require that abstinence be covered, only 20 states require education on condoms or contraception. These unsettling statistics reveal huge gaps in sexual education in many part of the United States. This harms all students, but can be especially damaging to BGLTQ students who don’t have as easy access to information about non-cisgender or non-heterosexual sex.
Even in states that do teach sexual education, curriculums centered around heterosexuality are the norm. Only 12 states require discussion of sexual orientation during sexual education. Of these 12, nine require that discussion of sexual orientation be inclusive, but three actually require that “only negative information on sexual orientation” be presented. The use of the term “sexual orientation” here is telling because all states that teach sexual education do in fact teach certain sexual orientations—heterosexuality, that is—as the default. Anything outside of heterosexuality is treated as an optional add-on rather than an integral part of the curriculum.
The stigma surrounding BGLTQ identities can also make it difficult to find accurate information that’s pertinent to BGLTQ individuals who do want to have sex. Many of the resources that cisgender heterosexual students have access to are unavailable to BGLTQ students, who are often burdened with a lack of representation in media, fear around talking about queer and trans identities with peers or parents, and a scarcity of online resources. Some BGLTQ students might not even be aware that the information relevant to them is missing. I, for one, had no idea that sex was possible between people of the same gender until high school—it just never came up before then.
Part of the problem is that the information presented in sexual education curriculums typically presents only one version of gender and sexuality as the norm. This is harmful to the BGLTQ students learning the “right” way to have sex and realizing that might not apply to them. For example, sexual education curriculums that assume that everyone needs to suppress their sexual desires until sex is “acceptable” erase individuals on the asexual spectrum who might not experience sexual desire. Moreover, the narrative that sex must occur between two people in a committed, closed relationship also reinforces monogamy and erases polyamorous people. Some classrooms teach that bodies are inherently gendered on a binary, and that there’s no difference between gender and sex: Women have vaginas and men have penises. This erases trans, non-binary, and intersex individuals who may not fit this strict binary.
HIV as well disproportionately affects members of the BGLTQ community, but only 34 states mandate HIV education in sexual education, not all of which require medical accuracy. It’s imperative that students learn factual, unbiased information about HIV and AIDS in school.
Some may argue that BGLTQ-inclusive sexual education promotes an “unnatural lifestyle” or that teens are too young to know what it means to be queer or trans. But the goal of sexual education should be to provide factual information so everyone can make informed decisions about their bodies and lives.  If sexual education isn’t BGLTQ-inclusive, it has failed and harmed a part of the population that it’s supposed to be empowering.
I’ve been wondering how I would respond if an eighth grader asked me what people do during sex. What are things I wish I’d known years ago? I think I’d start with this:
“Sex can happen between any number of people with any combination of genders and sexualities. There are many ways to have sex, and it should be consensual and enjoyable for all parties involved. If that includes reading, well, that’s perfectly fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, the 16th-seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County beat the top-seeded University of Virginia in the men’s NCAA basketball tournament. As a huge fan of underdogs, I was excited to see a 16-seed pull off such a big upset. My excitement quickly faded as I saw headlines referring to UMBC as the “first No. 16 seed [to] beat No. 1 seed” pop up on my TV, in the newspapers the next day, and all over my friends’ social media accounts. What I saw plastered all over the news was either a lie, or more likely, a complete disregard for women’s sports and female accomplishment. I, unlike many others, knew that 20 years earlier, Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s 16-seeded Harvard women’s basketball team defeated top-seeded Stanford. This was actually the first time a No. 16 seed ever beat a No. 1 seed in the NCAA basketball tournament, but because it was a women’s game, it has been forgotten and disregarded.
As a female athlete, I have always understood the massive inequality that exists between genders in sports. In high school, the stands at my basketball games were empty in comparison to those at the boys’ games. When I got to the collegiate level, nothing changed. I vividly remember being part of the Harvard women’s basketball team that matched the longest win-streak in the history of the program. Even at a place like Harvard, where gender equity is fought for, the team’s accomplishment went largely unrecognized.
I also remember men’s coach Tommy Amaker being recognized for hitting 179 wins, and being announced as the “winningest coach in Harvard [basketball] history.” In reality, Delaney-Smith, with 567 wins, is the “winningest coach in Harvard basketball history,” and Amaker is the winningest coach in Harvard men’s basketball history. Both coaches are incredible and have accomplished major milestones in their careers, but we need to be more careful with how we recognize those accomplishments. By saying “basketball” for men and “women’s basketball” for women, we implicitly acknowledge the men’s game as legitimate and the women’s game as an inferior derivative. Men and women are simply not portrayed equally. While some argue that there are greater problems to conquer when it comes to gender inequality, I believe that gender inequality in athletics publicly displays our society’s willingness to accept different treatment for men and women and is thus important to address.
Participating in athletics as both a young girl and young adult has been one of the most impactful and beneficial activities of my life. As a young girl who towered over all of my friends (both girls and boys), I often felt awkward and out of place.  The basketball court made me not only feel normal but also accepted and valued. It connected me to other people my age, which built long-lasting social capital I did not appreciate until later in life. As I got older and sports became more serious, the court was where I developed the major intangible skills that I possess today, such as teamwork, leadership, and perseverance.
As a female, athletics have been a crucial part of my personal development, and I believe athletics play that same role for almost everyone who partakes in them. If we ignore the accomplishments of female athletics or act as if they are completely separate and lesser than those in male athletics, what kind of message are we sending to young female athletes? Are we telling them that even though they may practice just as hard as a male, their accomplishment will never been recognized in the same fashion? Is our immensely biased coverage of sports subconsciously discouraging girls from participating in a potentially life-changing experience? If it is, we are keeping young women from much more than a good workout.
While this issue will not be changed overnight, it is important for us to do what we can right now to make progress. Next time you overhear someone talking about how amazing UMBC’s upset was, remind him or her that Harvard women’s basketball did it first (I would like to credit UMBC for doing this). Next time you attend a men’s basketball game on a Friday night and the women are playing too, go 45 minutes earlier and support both teams. And before you start posting about an NCAA record or feat being the first of its kind, maybe check your facts beforehand, because a woman or a women’s team might have been the first to accomplish it. I do not mean to take anything away from the great accomplishments of UMBC or Amaker, but it is extremely important to recognize the accomplishments of men and women equally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College recently decided to cancel the proposed “bridge” program for all-female unrecognized single-gender social organizations that would have allowed them to transition into compliance with the new sanctions policy over the course of a few years. Specifically, were the groups to become gender-neutral, the policy would have permitted them to maintain a “gender focus” for three to five years while not violating College policy. In light of the cancellation, administrators are promising that they will instead dedicate people and resources to specifically help all-female groups become gender-neutral.
This decision to not proceed with the program runs counter to both to the conclusions of a committee that was tasked with reviewing the policies in 2017 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s acceptance of those conclusions. However, we firmly believe that the bridge program is not the best way Harvard could allocate its resources to vital women’s issues.
In the past, unrecognized groups focused on women's empowerment—like the Sab Club (formerly known as the Sablière Society)—have become fully gender-neutral successfully in the past with no major troubles transitioning into their new membership or programming. Indeed, when it underwent this transition, members of the Sab Club stated that it kept and strengthened its mission of female empowerment by allowing non-women into an originally female space.
Thus, we believe a bridge program would have been unnecessary and have simply delayed the inevitability of gender neutrality for these organizations. Indeed, successful integration into gender neutrality does not require a program that leaves all-female organizations with one foot in and one foot out of the sanctions—such an initiative could sow confusion instead of a commitment to the goals of inclusivity and diversity. On the contrary, in order to truly excise exclusivity from the female unrecognized social organizations, the support and attention of the University on women’s issues will be required more than anything else.
Though the University’s language is vague and non-specific, we support its decision to aid unrecognized all-female organizations, especially during this important transition. We believe the most important thing the University can do in doing so is address the specific challenges women and female-identifying students experience and aid the organizations that are dedicated to the alleviation of those challenges. Additionally, if the University specifically has the funds to support women's initiatives, they should do so by supporting organizations on campus that address women's issues directly, including the Harvard College Women’s Center.
There are many ways the University can support women on this campus; the bridge program simply was not one of the most effective ways it could have done so. While aiding all-female social organizations in the transition to gender neutrality is important, the University should not pass the buck on responsibility for allowing women to thrive here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2018 at 12:07 p.m.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced he will step down from his position in an email sent to FAS affiliates Monday morning.
Smith’s decision to resign comes as he wraps up his 11th year overseeing the University’s largest faculty. During his tenure, Smith steered Harvard through budget cuts during the 2008 financial crisis and helped lead the FAS portion of the University’s record-breaking capital campaign. He also supervised the ongoing undergraduate House renewal project, as well as preparations for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s scheduled move across the river to Allston.
In his email Monday, Smith wrote he is “enormously thankful” for his colleagues and the faculty, staff, and students at Harvard.
“I am extremely proud to be part of this community,” Smith wrote. “It has been an undeniable privilege for this simple engineer to have had a front-row seat as our community built a foundation within the FAS that will continue Harvard’s commitment to excellence and truth now and into the future.”
After he steps down from the deanship, Smith, a Computer Science professor, will continue to teach and will return to “a life of new academic and personal pursuits,” according to his email. He added that he will continue to serve as FAS dean until President-Elect Lawrence S. Bacow appoints his successor.
Bacow was selected to serve as the University’s 29th president in February and will replace current president Drew G. Faust in July. Faust and Smith took office in the same year, 2007; Faust appointed Smith to his position just weeks before she assumed the presidency.
Though Smith plans to leave his office in University Hall, he said in an interview earlier this month that he has already been in touch with Bacow to share the Faculty’s goals for the future and “bring him up to speed.” He added he would make himself available to give Bacow updates on FAS affairs.
“I certainly feel as though it’s my job to make sure he understands what’s happening across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,” Smith said in the interview.
Faust also emailed FAS affiliates Monday morning to thank Smith for his service.
“He has been a steadfast partner, an enthusiastic collaborator, and an institutional citizen always focused on the progress of the FAS and the University,” Faust wrote of Smith. “Under Mike’s leadership, the FAS faculty has grown in breadth and strength, and both the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have attracted students of unsurpassed talent and promise.”
Faust announced in her email that Bacow will lead the search for the next FAS dean and invited affiliates to email him their thoughts on the search.
“[Bacow] has asked me to underscore that he sees the search not only as a way to identify a new dean, but also as a timely opportunity to learn more from many of you about the hopes and views of faculty, students, staff, and alumni throughout the FAS,” she wrote.
Throughout his time as dean, Smith contended with unexpected challenges and supervised major projects within the division. Shortly after he assumed the deanship, he was forced to grapple with the 2008 global recession. FAS trimmed $77 million dollar from its budget, in part by halting SEAS construction in Allston and by freezing faculty searches and salary increases.
Though the financial conditions of FAS have improved since the recession, the school has suffered from recent poor returns on the University’s endowment, which constitutes half its income.
Smith attracted controversy in 2013 when he authorized the search of 16 resident deans’ email accounts following widespread cheating in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.” The cheating scandal ultimately implicated over 120 students.
In recent years, Smith helped manage the FAS capital campaign, which helped support several FAS programs including the continuing $1 billion effort to renew the College’s undergraduate residential Houses as well as financial aid writ large. Though some FAS campaign priorities have lagged behind stated goals, the division passed its overall $2.5 billion target in Oct. 2016.
Under Smith, four houses have undergone renovation, including Dunster and Winthrop. Construction on Lowell began in 2017, and FAS has already slated Adams to be the next House to face renovations.
Following the pause in SEAS construction during the recession, Harvard has since resumed work on the area and the new Allston campus will open in 2020, on schedule.
Smith is not the only administrator who has chosen to depart Harvard in the last few weeks. Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Xiao-Li Meng, who was on a sabbatical, stepped down earlier this month. Interim GSAS Dean Emma Dench assumed his role.
Smith said in an interview earlier this month that the presidential transition could cause current administrators to reflect on their roles. But he declined to answer a question asking whether he would be leaving his post.
“I think people all are going through transition times. It's a natural time to think about ‘Do I want to continue doing this? Do I want to go up and do something else?’”

UPDATED: March 19, 7:46 p.m.
University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will step down from the board of directors of Henry Schein Inc., the Long Island, N.Y.-based health care supplies distributor disclosed Monday.
Bacow, who will succeed University President Drew G. Faust in July, cited “time commitment” to his new role as the reason for his decision not to run for re-election for Henry Schein’s board in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission document published Thursday.
“I am resigning from all of my boards to focus my time on my Harvard  responsibilities," Bacow wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
“Dr. Bacow will continue to serve as a director and as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee until the completion of the Annual Meeting,” the document reads. “Dr. Bacow’s decision not to stand for reelection was not in connection with a disagreement on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies or practices.”
Henry Schein Inc. is the world’s largest provider of health care supplies and services in the medical, dental, and veterinary industries, servicing more than 800,000 customers, according to the company’s website. The Fortune 500 company is part of the NASDAQ 100. Bacow joined Henry Schein’s Board of Directors in Dec. 2014.
Henry Schein’s board approved former Staples CEO Shira D. Goodman as Bacow’s replacement on Friday.
Bacow also served on the board of Loews Corporation, which he left in February, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission document.

Lawrence S. Bacow, Harvard’s 29th president, will be inaugurated into his new role in a ceremony filled with centuries-old traditions on Oct 5.
Bacow, who was announced as University president-elect in February, will officially assume his presidential duties on July 1. He is currently a member of the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body, and was formerly the president of Tufts University.
The ceremony, which lasted two-and-a-half hours in 2007 for University President Drew G. Faust’s inauguration, features the new president receiving the University's keys, seals, and charter, and sitting—for the first time publicly—in the infamous Holyoke chair.
The specific details of the ceremony are still being planned, but if prior iterations are any indication there will be a host of academic and public figures on hand to welcome Bacow into his new role. Bacow will also deliver his own address, which is likely to outline his plans for his tenure.
At Faust’s inauguration, University of Pennsylvania President Amy Gutmann ’71 spoke, along with then-Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, among others. The celebration involved thousands of attendees and representatives from more than 220 academic institutions.
University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email that Harvard’s last eight presidential inaugurations have taken place in October, a tradition dating back to the 1869 inauguration of the University’s 21st president, Charles W. Eliot, class of 1853. This timing allows for all students and faculty members to be on campus for the event, which will take place in Tercentenary Theatre.
The festivities, which will take place in the afternoon, are open to all Harvard affiliates.

The English Department received a record number of applications to its creative writing program this academic year, according to Darcy Frey, the program’s director.
This semester, the creative writing program is offering courses in playwriting, poetry, fiction writing, screenwriting, creative nonfiction, and journalism. The courses are generally capped at 12 people and interested students must submit an application, which typically entails providing a writing sample.
Frey wrote in an email that the program is “more popular than ever.”
“We received more applications in Fall, 2017 and Spring, 2018 than ever before, and we enrolled more students during those terms in workshops than ever before,” Frey wrote.
Nicholas J. Watson, English department chair, said the number of applications the department received was more than double the number of available spots in the program this semester.
“There were something like 240 places and there were nearly 800 applications from nearly 500 individual students,” Watson said. “Some of our seminars elsewhere in the department have that same number of applications, but it’s rare for a whole portion of the department to do that.”
The increase in applications coincides with an increase in the program’s course offerings over the past decade. In his email, Frey wrote that 14 workshops were offered in fall 2008, compared to 20 workshops in spring 2018.
“Because we have more creative-writing faculty now than ever before, we're able to offer an even more varied set of workshops,” Frey said. “For example, Jill Abramson is here teaching journalism, Michael Pollan teaches, in addition to an essay course, one on writing about the food chain.”
According to Watson, the program 10 years ago primarily offered courses in poetry, fiction, drama, and some screenwriting. Watson said that the course selection has since been augmented with “a lot of nonfiction.”
For the English Department, the Creative Writing program is not only “the thing that’s growing fastest,” but is also the the “easiest to excite new students about in many ways,” Watson said.
Watson added that the workshops help make up the department’s “outward facing” side; students in the workshops are both English concentrators and non-English concentrators.
Claire Messud, a senior lecturer in English who teaches several fiction writing workshops, said her courses are a “mix” of students “from all over the university” including science concentrators and graduate students. Messud said that some of her students have extensive creative writing backgrounds, while others are just “picking it up for the first time.”
“Everybody comes for a different reason,” Messud said. “But, one of the great things about the creative writing classes is that everyone’s there because they want to be.”
Frey wrote that while the Creative Writing program “draws incredible student writers” from within the English Department, the program is intentionally not restricted to concentrators.
“The workshops are very deliberately open to anyone in the Harvard community because there are talented student-writers in all parts of the college and university that we hope to serve, and a mix of interests and backgrounds among students seems to make for the most productive and exciting workshops,” Frey wrote.
Ryan Y. Lee ’20, a Computer Science concentrator, is currently enrolled in a creative fiction writing workshop. Lee said he applied to the course not only because of personal interest, but also because the class would satisfy his general education requirements.
“I just wanted something a little different from the normal STEM classes I take,” Lee said. “It looked like a pretty fun, interesting class. I’ve loved it.”
Jakob L. Gilbert ’21 and Emily N. Orr ’21 both said they “love” the dramatic screenwriting course they are taking this semester.
“It’s really interesting to be in a room with so many different perspectives,” said Orr, who is an aspiring screenwriter.
Orr added that people had warned her to temper expectations when applying for the workshop.
“A lot my friends that are upperclassmen were kind of cautioning me to not be hurt if I didn’t get into the class,” Orr said.
In response to high demand, faculty members teaching workshops say they envision expanding course offerings rather than increasing class sizes. Joshua D. Bell, a senior lecturer in English who teaches several poetry workshops, said he does not favor increasing the number of students who would be in each creative writing seminar.
“To expand the size of the class is to decrease the power of it, so I think it would be less in demand if we let more people in,” Bell said. “It’s kind of nice to have that small unit so I can kind of get into the individual poems.”
Sam Marks, a senior preceptor for several playwriting workshops, said that he thinks the creative writing program will continue to grow amid its popularity.
“I know they’re trying to bring in more creative writing teachers,” Marks said. “They’re trying to grow the department to meet demand.”

UPDATED: March 20, 2018 at 5:10 p.m.
Harvard College will no longer require applicants to submit scores from the optional writing portions of the ACT and SAT beginning with the Class of 2023, according to a Monday statement.
“Harvard will accept the ACT/SAT with or without writing, starting with the Class of 2023, entering in August 2019,” College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement. “This change will add an additional component to the comprehensive outreach of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI), which seeks outstanding students from all economic backgrounds.”
Students who choose to take the writing portion of either exam pay an extra $14 for the SAT and $16.50 for the ACT, though fee waivers are available for both.
Dane noted other ways applicants might demonstrate their writing skill, instead of on the standardized tests. The College accepts the Common, Coalition, and Universal College applications—all of which require a personal essay. Applicants also have the option to include an additional personal essay which, according to Dane, “most students will also choose to submit.” Applicants may also submit writing portfolios for faculty review.
In 2014, the College Board, which administers the SAT, announced major revisions to its exam, which made the essay optional and scored it separately from the rest of the exam, among other changes.
Shortly after the announcement of the SAT’s redesign in 2015, Harvard continued to require applicants to submit writing scores, but Dane said at the time that the College would evaluate how predictive those scores were of academic success.
College counselors and higher education experts previously criticized the essay portions of the exams, arguing that writing scores do not strongly correlate with a student’s potential for success.
“One single essay historically has not contributed significantly to the overall predictive power of the exam,” the College Board wrote in a 2015 statement on the revised SAT. “Feedback from hundreds of member admission officers was divided: some respondents found the essay useful, but many did not.”
The statement also reads: “The College Board remains steadfast in its commitment to the importance of analytic writing for all students.”
The College Board and the ACT did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.
Despite the choice given to students, the majority of the few million test-takers each year choose to complete the writing portion of the exams. According to the Princeton Review’s blog, Harvard’s decision leaves only 28 schools requiring the essays.
In 2015, other Ivy League universities, including, Columbia, Cornell, and Penn, announced they were ending the essay requirement. Brown, Dartmouth, and Yale are among the Ivies which still require essay scores. Among other peer institutions, Stanford requires the essay while MIT does not.
When Penn changed its policy, Eric J. Furda, the school’s dean of admissions, cited what he called the essays’ “weaker predictive power” in a 2015 statement.
“Our internal analysis as well as a review of the extensive research provided by the College Board showed that the essay component of the SAT was the least predictive element of the overall Writing section of the SAT,” Furda said.
College consultant Anna Ivey said she was supportive of Harvard’s decision.
“It's a good thing for colleges to drop the additional hassle and expense for applicants if the writing tests ultimately don't factor into the admissions decision much or at all,” Ivey wrote in an email.
Some current students tended to agree, saying the essay portions of the exams may not be useful tools in the admissions process.
Natalie G. Cohen ’20 said she thinks the policy change is a “good thing.” She said she believes the exam essays are not especially reflective of students’ writing abilities.
Jordan “Jojo” A. Adler ’20, on the other hand, said she thinks the change is “not necessarily a good or bad thing.” Speaking from her own experience of taking the ACT, she said the essay was “not representative” of her writing.

A lawsuit alleging discrimination against Asian-American students in the College’s admissions process may now be scheduled for trial in Jan. 2019, according to a March 14 case filing.
The case filing comes only a few days after a previous March 9 filing which had indicated a trial may commence as early as July 2018.
Allison D. Burroughs, a U.S. district court judge who is hearing the case in Boston, laid out a timeline for forthcoming stages of the lawsuit, including consideration of an anticipated dispositive motion over the summer—something the plaintiffs hope may lead to a summary judgement in its favor.
Outstanding disagreements over the handling of confidential information, such as data related to students’ admissions files—along with a proposed trial schedule—will be considered at an April 10 hearing.
This is the latest development in the ongoing lawsuit filed in 2014 by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
The March 9 status report filed by representatives from both SFFA and the University, laid out the parties’ priorities as the discovery period for the case comes to a close.
In the report, Harvard said the University “respectfully requests that the Court schedule a bench trial commencing in mid-July 2018.” Should the trial be delayed past the summer, Harvard argues, a variety of logistical barriers may make it “impossible to hold a trial in this case until the late spring or summer of 2019.”
SFFA instead makes the case for a potential summary judgement, as opposed to a full trial, and “requests that the Court maintain the existing schedule and either refrain from setting a trial date or set trial for at least two months after summary judgment briefing concludes.”
The new order sets summer deadlines for the filing of amicus briefs in favor or opposition of a dispositive motion, which could lead to a summary judgement—allowing the court to “make a judgment as to whether trial is necessary” and “allow any trial to proceed more expeditiously than it might otherwise,” according to SFFA’s portion of the report.
As the case moves closer to trial, the parties will address the potential release of prior applicants’ confidential records and Harvard’s secretive admissions process. Harvard and SFFA continue to dispute the extent to which that information should be made public.
Edward Blum, president of SFFA, said his organization hopes to make public all of the evidence considered in the case.
“Students for Fair Admissions looks forward to showing the court and the American public the complete record of our legal endeavors during the past three and a half years,” Blum said.
Harvard spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven did not comment on the specific provisions of Burroughs’ order, though a statement from the University regarding the related Justice Department probe noted that Harvard “seeks to prevent public disclosure of confidential and highly sensitive student and applicant information entrusted to our protection.”

More than one hundred Harvard affiliates and Boston area residents gathered in front of the John Harvard statue Monday to protest the recent assassination of Marielle Franco, a Brazilian human rights activist and city councilor in Rio de Janeiro.
Last Wednesday, Franco was shot with multiple bullets by assailants, who followed the 38-year-old councilor’s movements as she was making her way back home from a meeting about empowering black women, according to the New York Times. Franco’s driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, was also killed during the incident.
Carolina A.C. San Miguel, a doctoral candidate at the Graduate School of Design, helped organize the Boston protest opposing Franco’s assassination. The protest followed several marches across Brazil that occurred in the wake of Wednesday’s attack.
“We have a group of Brazilian researchers here in Boston, and we started talking online just this weekend. We built a Whatsapp group, wrote a letter together, and decided to organize a gathering,” San Miguel said.
Students from several Harvard graduate schools, as well as MIT, helped organize the event, according to San Miguel.
Joao M. Abreu, a master’s degree student at the Kennedy School, also helped lead the protest.
“This was a very spontaneous process. We realized that all the Brazilians living here were very shocked and wanted to do something,” Abreu said. “We are far from the country, but we still want to have a voice and show our concerns and worries about the situation back home.”
“We were expecting 10 people at the protest,” San Miguel said. “But on Facebook, it seemed like there was a whole bunch of people—like 500 people—interested. For us, it’s not about size. It’s just about people talking and gathering together from all over. This is the city with the biggest community of Brazilians outside of Brazil. So this a very significant and symbolic place. And we have to say what we think.”
San Miguel, Abreu, and other protest organizers took turns reading portions of a letter addressed to Franco they wrote in English and Portuguese. Throughout the reading, protesters collectively chanted “Marielle is here, Anderson is here” in both languages.
“We demand the end of the collective search warrants, the end of military justice jurisdiction over civilians, and for the extinction of the military police for ordinary public safety,” Abreu read from the letter.
Afterwards, protesters gave speeches expressing their grief and visions for justice in light of the assassination. Carlos A. F. Da Silva, a Brazilian-American school committee member in Hingham, Mass., was one of the speakers.
“I never thought I would be here, seeking justice for Brazilians overseas,” DaSilva said. "Over forty elected representatives have been killed over the last two years in Brazil. This is a shame. We must bring this to light.”
Several protesters held signs and wore Brazilian flags, including Anna Borges, a former Portuguese teaching assistant in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, who made a sign that translates: “Wake up Brazil! Let us fight for peace, justice, and democracy.”
A few weeks before her death, Franco criticized the police brutality that she said has caused increasing violence and hatred in Rio de Janeiro, according to the New York Times. She argued that a trigger-happy police culture and entrenched inequality are at the root of decades of violence afflicting hundreds of people.
In the last year alone, there were more than 6,700 violent deaths in Rio de Janeiro State, the New York Times reported.
Sussen Gazal, a former Brazilian journalist who currently works in Cambridge, said she was proud of the achievements Franco made during her lifetime.
“We have come here today to not only honor [Marielle’s] death, but to recognize the important impact she had on Brazilians all over the world,” Gazal said. “Everybody is busy with their lives but when you see people coming together like this, it is a reminder that we have to remember our roots and our home countries.”
“Marielle, we have united to call for an immediate, rigorous, and transparent investigation into your death. Above all, Marielle, we have united to continue your fight,” Abreu said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decision of Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, to step down shortly before President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow takes Harvard’s top job follows a pattern set by multiple of Smith’s predecessors across several decades.
Over the past 70 years, four presidential transitions have brought a subsequent resignation from the FAS dean—the leader of Harvard’s flagship faculty.
Smith announced his departure Monday morning in an email sent to FAS affiliates, writing he plans to step down as soon as Bacow appoints his replacement. Bacow will take Harvard’s helm on July 1, succeeding University President Drew G. Faust. Faust and Smith have both held their respective positions since 2007; Faust appointed Smith weeks before she took office.
Smith—a Computer Science professor—wrote in his Monday email that he is stepping down to return to a “life of new academic and personal pursuits.” He plans to remain on campus to teach. Past FAS deans, though, sometimes explicitly cited the University president’s departure as the reason they wished to leave Harvard.
When former Harvard President James B. Conant, class of 1913, stepped down from the office in 1953, Paul H. Buck, then-dean of FAS, announced his resignation that same month.
"President Conant and I acted as a team. Now that team is no more," Buck said, according to a Jan. 1953 Crimson article. "I would prefer to return to teaching."
Jeremy R. Knowles, FAS dean from 1991 to 2002, departed a year after Neil L. Rudenstine vacated the University presidency in 2001. Knowles told The Crimson in 2002 that he had long felt his term would conclude with Rudenstine’s.
“Several years ago, I thought about this and decided that an overlap of a year was probably best for the institution and the Faculty,” he said at the time.
Similarly, John T. Dunlop, who held the deanship from 1970 to 1973, left two years after the departure of the University president he served under, Nathan M. Pusey.
In a February interview, University President Drew G. Faust said presidential transitions at Harvard often serve as intuitive career breaks for the administrators who serve under the University’s top leader.
"People who have served with me may feel that their chunk of time is the appropriate one,” she said. “I think it’s less about me than this is a time when it’s a moment to do something different and something new.”
As one of Harvard’s most powerful administrators, when an FAS dean resigns in the middle of a University president’s tenure, the leader of Harvard’s flagship faculty has historically left for career reasons.
McGeorge Bundy, who, at 34, became the youngest-ever dean of FAS when Pusey appointed him in 1953, left Harvard in 1961 to work for another president. Bundy became the national security adviser in the administration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy ’40.
And, in 1990, A. Michael Spence, who served as FAS dean from 1984 to 1990, shocked campus when he abruptly departed for Palo Alto, Calif. to become the dean of Stanford’s Graduate School of Business.
One notable exception to the pattern of turnover for FAS deans is William C. Kirby, Smith’s immediate predecessor, who served from 2002 to 2006. In a controversial move, then-University President Lawrence H. Summers forced Kirby out of the deanship, one of several actions that precipitated Summers’s own displacement just a short time later.
Though Smith declined to directly answer whether he planned to leave his post in an interview with The Crimson earlier this month, he echoed Faust’s earlier words from February.
“I think people all are going through transition times. It's a natural time to think about ‘Do I want to continue doing this? Do I want to go up and do something else?’” Smith said.
David I. Laibson ’88, chair of the Economics Department, said he thinks there is “often turnover when a new president takes office.”
“There isn’t any formula for how that works,” he said. “So we’ll have to wait and see how this transition will play out during this transition from President Faust to President Bacow.”
With his resignation, Smith joins the growing list of Harvard administrators who have chosen to depart over the past several months, including the dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the College’s dean of undergraduate education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colleagues praised Michael D. Smith’s tackling of difficult situations and “brilliant” leadership during his 11-year tenure as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences after he announced Monday he plans to step down from the position.
Smith announced his plans to resign Monday morning in an email sent to FAS affiliates. In his message, Smith, a Computer Science professor, wrote he will return to teaching as soon as University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow appoints his successor.
Smith’s departure will coincide with the departure of current University President Drew G. Faust, who appointed him shortly before she took office.
Several professors praised Smith's leadership over the past decade, highlighting his handling of the 2008 financial crisis that decimated the FAS budget. Economics Department chair David I. Laibson ’88 said he thinks Smith’s handling of the constrained financial situation demonstrated “sophistication” during tough times.
“He handled an impossible situation extremely well,” Laibson said. “As we came through that financial crisis, he cut where we needed to cut, but never cut into the muscle or the bone of the organization. And being able to navigate that environment, and make those difficult decisions, and do all of that well, and in a timely manner, requires a great deal of sophistication and brilliance.”
David L. Howell, chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, also pointed to Smith’s conduct during the financial crisis when asked about Smith’s greatest accomplishments.
“I think it was probably a really difficult period for him,” Howell said. “The financial hardship and uncertainty lasted quite a long time, so I think he did it about as well as anyone could hope to under the circumstances of the financial crisis.”
Smith began his deanship in July 2007, immediately before the start of an international recession. Under his watch, FAS made major budget cuts as it faced projections that the value of the University’s endowment value would drop by a record-breaking 30 percent.
Smith froze faculty salaries, cut back on staff searches, and halted construction of the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences campus in Allston.
“The fact that he succeeded in that challenging moment is a testimony to his leadership,” Laibson said.
“I think he did a very nice job in dealing with all the constraints, and yet keeping Harvard’s priorities in hiring the best people, and retaining the best faculty in front of him, and keeping that standard high while not having unlimited resources after the crash,” said Subir Sachdev, the chair of the Physics department.
Another signature initiative of Smith’s tenure comprised his effort to fundraise for the University’s record-breaking capital campaign.
In an interview Monday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana praised Smith’s contribution to “the things we now take for granted." As examples, he listed financial aid commitments and the ongoing House Renewal project, which seeks to renovate all of the College's 12 undergraduate residential Houses.
Despite the negative effects of the financial crisis, FAS has remained committed to the more than $1 billion House renovation project. Smith has overseen the renewal of four Houses, and two more are scheduled to be renovated within the next five years.
“He’s made extraordinary contributions to House Renewal,” Khurana said Monday. “The entire House Renewal project, with respect to its physical renewal, but also its programmatic renewal, has been spearheaded by Dean Smith."
Colleagues also lauded Smith’s efforts to grow the SEAS, a move Sachdev called “a tricky process.”
“It’s a big change in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering,” Sachdev said. “He started a process that required negotiation with many stakeholders and I think he did a good job with that.”
Francis J. Doyle III, dean of SEAS, also praised Smith’s commitment to Harvard’s newest school in a press release Monday.
“Mike has consistently been a terrific partner through the growth phases of SEAS, but his legacy of leadership during that challenging financial period is particularly noteworthy,” Doyle said in the press release.
Harry R. Lewis ’68, a colleague of Smith’s in the Computer Science department, said he looked forward to Smith’s return to the academic field. Before his deanship, Smith taught the department’s flagship introductory course—Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
“It will be great to have him back as a colleague, after his years of service in one of the toughest jobs in higher education,” Lewis wrote in an emailed statement.
Khurana said he will miss working with Smith when Smith returns to the classroom. Khurana added he will miss his “walks home” with the FAS dean.
“I feel really close to him,” Khurana said. “He’s somebody who you can just be open with and honest with, and he always makes you feel confident and lifts you up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College administrators are “working in collaboration” with the Government Department to manage fallout from recent sexual harassment allegations made against Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview Monday.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in late February that at least 10 women are alleging Dominguez committed repeated acts of sexual harassment across the past three decades. Now, the total count of women making allegations against Dominguez has risen to at least 18.
The accusations have sparked turmoil on Harvard’s campus, prompting administrators to put Dominguez on “leave.” Following his placement on leave, Dominguez said he would retire amidst growing student outcry and debate.
In the wake of the revelations, University President Drew G. Faust said she and other administrators had no knowledge of allegations against Dominguez before the Chronicle published its Feb. 27 story. Khurana also said Monday he had no prior knowledge of the allegations.
“I was not aware of these issues that had been described,” Khurana said.
Previous Harvard administrators sanctioned Dominguez for sexual misconduct once already, decades ago. In 1983, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences disciplined Dominguez for allegedly sexually harassing Terry L. Karl, then an associate professor in the Government Department.
Now, administrators could punish Dominguez once again. Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, announced in a March 4 email sent to Harvard affiliates that the University has opened an investigation into allegations against the professor.
Harvard will take into account the outcome of its ongoing investigation into Dominguez in determining whether Dominguez will receive the rights and privileges normally provided to retired faculty members, FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven said in early March.
Khurana said College administrators have collaborated with multiple Harvard offices since allegations against Dominguez surfaced in the Chronicle.
“The College, working through the Office of Undergraduate Education and through our Title IX office, has been working in collaboration with the Government Department to see how we can best support our students during this time,” he said.
In recent weeks, students and faculty in that department have decried Dominguez’s alleged sexual harassment. In early March, graduate students sent a letter to Government Department faculty condemning their handling of sexual assault accusations against Dominguez and demanding the department take steps to address “years of apparent negligence” towards issues of sexual misconduct.
The department also formed a “standing committee” to investigate the “conditions” that allowed Dominguez to remain active in the department for decades while allegedly sexually harassing at least 18 women throughout that time period, department administrators wrote in a letter sent to undergraduate concentrators.
Other University administrators have also vowed to extend support to students in the aftermath of the Dominguez allegations. In an email announcing Dominguez’s “administrative leave” earlier this month, Smith wrote it is “imperative” that Harvard lend support to those who have suffered sexual harassment.
“We will use every means at our disposal to ensure that we create a safe and healthy community in which people can thrive,” Smith wrote.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 wrote in an email to University affiliates shortly after the Chronicle’s first piece ran that Harvard is committed to creating a “safe and healthy educational and work environment.”
Garber asked Harvard affiliates to come forward if they had experienced sexual harassment or assault.
Khurana said Monday he hopes all acts of sexual misconduct will eventually be eradicated from Harvard’s campus.
“This is a very distressful thing that happened,” Khurana said. “Sexual harassment, sexual assault, treating anybody in a disrespectful way that doesn’t respect their bodily integrity is unacceptable.”
“I hope for Harvard College and Harvard University to be a place where each individual can expect to be in a place that they experience a sense of respect,” Khurana added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Monday to bar Harvard College Faith and Action from receiving UC funding after an at-times contentious debate that lasted nearly an hour.
The approved UC legislation prevents the religious group from receiving any Council funding for the remainder of spring 2018. The UC’s legislation also stipulates that the moratorium on funding could last “until new leadership takes tangible action to reform the organization.”
Any move to reinstate funding for the group will be subject to the approval of two of the Council’s internal bodies, the Finance Committee and the Queer Caucus. The UC added this stipulation to the legislation in an amendment Monday evening to ensure a diverse set of representatives will take part in the decision to reinstate funding.
Last month, the College placed HCFA—the largest Christian fellowship on campus—on year-long “administrative probation.” The Crimson reported in February that the move to punish HCFA was almost certainly linked to the group’s decision to remove a female, bisexual student from a leadership position after she chose to date a woman.
In total, 26 Council representatives voted in favor of the legislation to suspend funding, while eight voted against the proposal and two abstained.
Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18, the co-presidents of HCFA, could not immediately be reached for comment Monday evening.
At a UC Finance Committee on March 7, the committee recommended the Council ban HCFA from receiving UC funding. That recommendation followed a failed vote—held in February, days after College administrators announced HCFA’s probation—during which the finance committee nixed a previous draft of legislation also intended to bar the religious group from UC funding. During that vote, members operated under the assumption “administrative probation” meant HCFA was automatically prohibited from receiving Council funding.
At the March 7 meeting, UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said Alexander R. Miller, the College’s associate dean of student engagement, told him the College’s decision did not impact HCFA’s eligibility to apply for and receive UC funding.
Administrators have repeatedly refused to publicly clarify the terms of HCFA’s probation—but The Crimson reported earlier this month that the punishment will likely have little practical effect.
On Monday, Finance Committee chair Henry S. Atkins ’20 recommended the Council strip HCFA of its ability to receive UC funding.
“We think that it’s appropriate that, as a result of apparent discrimination that seems to have occured within the organization, that we as a Council take a stand on this,” Atkins said.
Since the 2015-2016 school year, HCFA has received more than $1,000 in Finance Committee grants, according to the committee’s records.
Though it may have little effect given the amount of Council funding HCFA has historically accepted, Sarah Fellman ’18, a Quincy House representative, said she thinks the Council’s vote is nonetheless important.
“I think this is, as it’s called, about solidarity,” Fellman said. “I think this is an important symbolic move to show that we, as the elected representatives of the student body, will not tolerate discrimination.”
The Council in late February passed a resolution denouncing the actions of HCFA and affirming its support for BGLTQ Harvard affiliates.
Multiple Council members said at the meeting they are concerned cutting UC funding would unnecessarily harm HCFA’s general membership, rather than just the group’s leadership. Victoria M. Marquez ’20, a Pforzheimer House representative who voted against the legislation, said suspending funding for HCFA would also affect organization members who did not play a role in the controversial decision to demote the bisexual student.
“I know it’s a huge, over 200-student organization, so if we do choose to suspend the funding, it’s affecting a lot more people than the people involved in this decision,” Marquez said.
Other representatives questioned the Council’s ability to verify the allegations against HCFA’s leadership. Parth C. Thakker ’18, a Kirkland House representative, characterized the Council’s discussions as focusing on the veracity of what occurred as opposed to the representatives’ opinions on the issue itself.
“A lot of the disagreement we had in this room was more on what exactly occurred, whether it was discrimination or a celibacy rule, rather than, per se, how we all feel about what occurred,” Thakker said.
The Council previously debated inviting HCFA leadership to field questions from UC representatives before deciding whether or not to cut the group’s funding. Boucher, in a Slack message sent Sunday night and obtained by The Crimson, invited all Council members to an optional question-and-answer session with HCFA leadership before the Monday meeting.
Six UC representatives attended the meeting to discuss the proposed funding ban, according to Boucher.
Atkins conceded the Council could not independently verify the allegations against HCFA. But he argued there was sufficient evidence for the UC’s decision to ban funding.
“I think that the evidence out there is compelling enough that it would be a miscalculation on our part not to take action,” Atkins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team’s busy Spring Break concluded with a flurry of games in the Carolinas, as the Crimson visited Davidson and South Carolina for one game each before traveling to Furman for four more.
The six games, played between last Wednesday and Saturday, come right after Harvard’s four-game sweep of Presbyterian the weekend prior. The matchups represented a final tune-up before conference play and perhaps a chance to climb over .500 for the Crimson squad.
Harvard, however, floundered early on, getting off to slow starts in being outscored 41-9 over the span of the first three games. The Crimson couldn’t catch any breaks in being routed 13-3 by Davidson and 12-3 by South Carolina before dropping the first game to Furman, 16-3.
Harvard stopped the streak of blowout losses with a solid 6-2 win over Furman on Friday, but still dropped the tail-end pair of games, 7-6 and 8-6.
Despite comebacks wins abounding earlier in the season, early deficits all weekend proved to be killer for the Crimson (7-11). In four of the five games it lost, Harvard left the first inning trailing by at least a run. In the only game it won, the squad left the first inning ahead by a run.
“We definitely want to get off to a better start,” junior center fielder Ben Skinner said. “It’s obviously fun when you come back late in the game and we’ve shown fight this season, but it’s a tough position to be in—we don’t want to have to fight back every single game.”
Through March 18, Davidson was ranked 227th on the RPI Div I baseball rankings, while South Carolina was ranked 127th and Furman was ranked 148th. The Crimson clocked in at 202nd.
“With that being said, we’re not particularly disappointed with the results this weekend,” Skinner said. “Obviously we wanted wins that we didn’t get, but we thought we played well overall, and headed into Ivies, I think we’re feeling pretty confident.”
The team resumes play next weekend at Princeton to kick off Ivy League play.
FURMAN 8, HARVARD 6
Skinner led the way for Harvard offensively, going 3-for-5 at the plate with two runs scored, an RBI, and a stolen base, but Furman’s 15 hits were too much to overcome in the series-capper on Saturday afternoon. For the Paladins (13-7), freshman Ben Anderson shredded the Crimson pitching, gathering four hits in five at-bats, scoring twice, and knocking in three. Anderson is now hitting .413 on the season and has a 1.128 OPS.
For Harvard, junior first baseman Patrick McColl reached base four times in the three-hole, gathering steam after a slow start to the season. Junior catcher Jake Allen, the team’s batting-average leader, went 2-for-5 but struck out twice.
The team’s offensive efforts, however, ultimately fell short as the Crimson couldn’t recover from playing catch-up all game. The squad faced deficits of 4-2 and 6-3 before falling by a final scoreline of 8-6.
“Going forward, we just have to carry the same attitude that we’ve carried into the past couple of weekends, in that, we are a good team, and we belong where we are, playing against good competition,” Allen said. “We’re certainly capable of winning what most people would consider talented baseball programs.”
FURMAN 7, HARVARD 6
Skinner, junior catcher Devan Peterson, and freshman Buddy Mrowka all went yard, but an early 6-0 deficit proved too deep a hole for Harvard to climb out of, even with a furious rally.
In a game scheduled for seven innings due to the Friday doubleheader, Mrowka’s three-run bomb in the sixth inning brought the scoreline to 6-3. Reignited after being shut out all game, the Crimson made a serious comeback bid with three more scores in the final inning, but a single tally in the bottom of the sixth by the Paladins proved fatal in a 7-6 decision.
For the home team, Anderson once again had a good day at the plate, going 3-for-4 with three RBIs, while junior Bret Huebner went 3-for-3 with the winning RBI single.
Junior righty Kevin Stone pitched yet another complete game but gave up seven earned runs in six innings of work.
HARVARD 6, FURMAN 2
After losing in a third straight rout the day before, Harvard stepped it up on Friday afternoon and took an early lead it never relinquished. For the only time all weekend, the Crimson took the lead out of the first inning, a 1-0 advantage on a McColl RBI, and only built on it from there.
Junior righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson was the hero of the game, safeguarding Harvard’s lead by tossing a complete-game, three-hit effort whilst striking out 11.
The Madison, Wis., native threw 109 pitches, 77 for strikes, walked one, and gave up just one earned run, a last-inning solo home run that didn’t change the course of the game. Part of Rosenblum-Larson’s success came in limiting Anderson, the Paladin’s rookie sensation, to an 0-for-3 game at the plate.
Meanwhile, junior second baseman Matt Rothenberg powered the Crimson offense with two home runs, a solo shot in the second and a two-run blast in the fourth. Senior Austin Black also hit an insurance two-run dinger to up the lead to 6-1 in the sixth.
FURMAN 16, HARVARD 3
The series opener on Thursday afternoon was all Paladins, as the home team walked all over the visiting Crimson squad, 16-3.
After finding itself in a 4-0 deficit early on, Harvard brought it back to a competitive game, 4-3, on a McColl three-run blast. Furman, however, proceeded to put the game well out of reach with a five-spot in the seventh and a seven-spot in the eighth. The Crimson bullpen simply collapsed as the Paladins piled on 17 hits over the course of the game, most of which came in the merry-go-round seventh and eighth innings.
In a bright spot for the team, Harvard drew 10 walks on the game, displaying its patience at the plate.
SOUTH CAROLINA 12, HARVARD 3
On Wednesday in Columbia, S.C., the Crimson was unable to keep pace with South Carolina (13-7), a strong SEC team that defeated No. 2 Florida just last Saturday.
The Gamecocks scored twice in the opening frame to take a 2-1 lead and never looked back, getting RBIs from six different players en route to a 12-3 victory. Harvard sophomore Hunter Bigge got the loss on the mound after pitching 4.2 innings, giving up seven runs, four of them unearned. The righty also issued six walks.
Skinner went 2-for-3 in the leadoff spot and drew two free passes, while Black went 2-for-4 and drove in two runs. Black’s fourth-inning homer and RBI double in the fifth were most of what the Crimson could muster after a promising first frame led to just one run.
South Carolina outhit Harvard 14-6 and committed one error to the Harvard’s two.
DAVIDSON 13, HARVARD 3
The feel-good vibes from the Crimson’s four-game win streak didn’t last long, as Davidson (14-5) put a hurting on the visiting Harvard squad early and often on Tuesday.
The Wildcats put up nine runs before the Crimson even scratched the scoreboard in the sixth inning. Trailing 9-0, Harvard scored a few more times on four hits, but the runs didn’t matter, as the visitors eventually fell 13-3.
Davidson took a 3-0 lead four batters into the game, and the Crimson never recovered as the game quickly became a blowout. The game foretold the troubles that Harvard would have in falling behind early all week long.
A platoon of four Crimson pitchers each worked an inning in relief of sophomore starter Kieran Shaw, who was tagged for seven runs, eight hits, and two homers in the loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Not many NCAA hockey players can say that they have skated for three teams in a single season. Former Harvard standout Ryan Donato is an exception.
Sunday night, the junior announced his early departure from the College to join the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins, just two days after the Harvard men's hockey season concluded and a month after returning from his stint for team USA in the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Donato, who inked a two-year entry-level deal with his hometown team, promptly hit the ice with his new teammates for a morning skate on Monday before his NHL debut that evening. The Scituate, Mass., native had one of the busiest days of his life, but his first day as a Bruin will certainly be one to remember.
Before logging even 10 minutes of ice time in the black and gold, Donato tallied his first NHL goal on a one-timer from his lethal office: the left circle. An ecstatic Donato and a roaring TD Garden crowd made for the highlight of an already momentous day in the life and career of the recent Crimson iceman.
“It’s a whirlwind experience,” Donato said, before pivoting to discuss his goal. “I’m pretty sure I blacked out during it. It was a lot of fun, and I still can’t believe it happened myself.”
The jam-packed day began with a casual but important skate at Boston’s practice facility, the Warrior Ice Arena. While only half an hour in duration, the morning run-through allowed Donato to ease into his NHL gig and get to know his new team—a squad that includes both future hall-of-famers and up-and-coming stars.
Head coach Bruce Cassidy did not waste much time getting his young forward involved. Donato led the pre-practice stretch, surrounded on all sides by his new teammates.
The second-round draft pick’s acclimation was made easier by the fact he recognized plenty of the faces in the locker room. By virtue of attending Boston’s development camp for each of the last three summers, the left-hander had already met six skaters in Monday night’s lineup. Among these was ex-Denver forward Danton Heinen, who played the wing opposite Donato in his debut.
Another familiar face for this year’s ECAC Player of the Year was the oldest competitor on the ice on Monday, 39-year-old forward Brian Gionta. The 5’7” NHL veteran captained the USA Olympic team for which Donato played in February and promises to be a valuable mentor for the recent signing.
“[Gionta] played with him over at the Olympics,” Coach Cassidy said after Monday’s morning skate. “That’s a good guy to have right away to bounce ideas off on the bench. [Ryan] should have plenty of feedback.”
Donato could not escape the media after the skate. Journalists, television stations, and radio commentators battled to hear the 21-year-old’s thoughts on his first day in the NHL. While the attention may have been distracting, Donato had his eyes set on the main event.
At 7:00 p.m. the puck dropped for Donato’s inaugural NHL game, with a streaking Columbus Blue Jackets team in town and looking for two points. The tilt marked the culmination of a life’s dedication to hockey.
“During warmups actually, I was just kind of taken away,” Donato said. “It kind of felt like a dream, and I really didn’t even get that warmed up because I was too focused on everything else and just kind of the whole situation… It was an unbelievable experience.”
The late scratch of Bruins forward Rick Nash meant coach Cassidy needed a fill-in for second-line left wing duties. Donato received a promotion without even taking a NHL shift, getting bumped up from the fourth line to fill Nash’s void. Plus, Donato received ice time with the second power play unit, so the team was counting on his contribution from his very first shift.
“It’s kind of a unique situation where I come in when the team is needing players,” Donato said of his unforeseen top-six role in his debut. “I’m just happy that they thought highly enough of me to put me in those situations to have success. When you’re playing with great players, it’s not too hard to have success.”
The ex-Harvard iceman did not disappoint. Almost six minutes into the middle frame, Donato ripped a give-and-go pass short-side on Columbus goaltender Joonas Korpisalo.
He celebrated with his linemates. He celebrated with the home crowd. He celebrated with his family and college teammates in attendance and with the entire city of Boston, hailing its newest hometown hockey prodigy.
“For me, it was a blessing,” said Donato, when asked about debuting at home. “Some people would think it’s tough just because there’s a lot of commotion with your friends...but those are the people—friends and family—that support you, and I couldn’t be happier to have these guys here.”
As if scoring in his first game was not enough, Donato followed up his goal with a pair of assists and became one of the Bruins’ major creators of offense on Monday night. For the Dexter School product, though, it was business as usual.
“I think early, he was trying to make some plays but then realized, ‘Listen, just play to your strength,’” Coach Cassidy said of Donato’s debut performance. “I’m sure there’s a few teaching moments once you go back over the game tape…but I liked him a lot. I’m sure [center David Krejci] did as well, they seemed to have some good chemistry.”
Despite Donato’s best effort, he will have to wait until Wednesday for another crack at his first NHL win. The Blue Jackets stole the game in overtime, 5-4.
“It was fun. Obviously it ended tough,” Donato said. “It all went well personally, but obviously it’s still bitter because of the loss.”
Win or lose, Donato’s individual performance left Bruins fans giddy with excitement. Sure, he marked up the score sheet. But perhaps more importantly for a break-in player, Donato acted as a determining force in the game without hesitation. The same Ryan Donato Harvard saw for three seasons and Team USA saw for three weeks came out to skate on Monday night.
“This is one game, but some of the guys that come in, you saw this with [defenseman Charlie] McAvoy,” Coach Cassidy said, noting that Donato fearlessly put forth his brand of hockey. “He just played his game. It would be great if he has similar success…. [I’m] very impressed by that, to be able to come in here, especially [in] your home town, maybe [with] some jitters there.”
In a span barely longer than 24 hours, the former Crimson centerpiece signed a professional contract, began integrating himself with his new team, handled an onslaught of media attention, and accomplished a milestone he will never forget.
Not bad for a day’s work. But, even with his newfound limelight and shiny NHL contract, Donato left TD Garden late Monday night planning to return to his same old dorm room in Harvard’s Winthrop House.
Not only is the forward living at school for the time being, but he also plans to complete the academic semester. The sociology concentrator has every intention of earning his degree, ideally at the same time the rest of his class does, even if it means lugging his books on the team’s road trips.
Over the next few months, Ryan Donato will navigate the tricky balance between his professional hockey obligations and his schooling. For now, you can catch him in class Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.—no, that is not a misprint. The academic junior will attend lecture and take notes as if Monday's events simply never happened.
In reality, though, Donato could not have experienced a more thrilling—and exhausting—first day as a Boston Bruin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen of the Harvard men’s hockey team has signed a two-year entry-level contract with the Arizona Coyotes organization of the National Hockey League, according to a statement released on Tuesday. The senior is the first member of the Class of 2018 to announce his future plans since the Crimson’s season ended after a 5-4 overtime loss to Clarkson on Friday. Madsen was a sixth-round 2013 draft pick (162nd overall) of the Philadelphia Flyers, and had his rights traded to Arizona in June 2017.
"[Madsen] is a big, skilled, athletic goaltender," said Coyotes general manager John Chayka in a press release from the team. "We're pleased with his development and excited to have him signed."
There’s no denying that Madsen will go down as one of the program’s greatest goaltenders. As a junior (28-6-2, 2.11 GAA, .923 SV%), he started all 36 of the Crimson’s contests and rode a 16-game winning streak, the longest of any Harvard net-minder, all the way to the team’s first Frozen Four appearance since 1994. Beyond his sturdy 2016-2017 performance, Madsen’s total body of work will leave a lasting mark on the program’s record books. In terms of career numbers, he will finish first in save percentage (.924%), second in shutouts (10), third in wins (56), and fifth in goals against average (2.12).
In his final season wearing the crimson, Madsen experienced both ups and downs. The ECAC semifinal loss that ended Harvard’s 2017-2018 campaign—a back-and-forth affair with plenty of drama—perfectly captured Madsen’s year as a whole. The net-minder (23 GS, 10-10-3, 2.27 GAA, .918 SV%) looked unbeatable in some matchups, registering three shutouts on the season and anchoring his team. But he also put forth a series of pedestrian starts.
Coming off such a stellar junior season, Madsen looked to be the obvious starter for Harvard but was nonetheless forced to earn his spot in the cage while junior Michael Lackey vied for ice time. Despite the ups and downs of the year, though, Madsen is confident that the goalie battle did not affect his career prospects—if anything, it gave him a flavor for a normal depth chart between the pipes.
“It’s healthy competition,” Madsen said. “If I didn’t have Lackey, or [sophomore goaltender Cam] Gornet...on my heels, it’s easy to get complacent…. I’m thankful that they were there.”
Throughout the course of the campaign, the team fell into multiple ruts, jeopardizing Madsen’s starting role. As an experienced backstop and key leader for the Crimson, Madsen was challenged by coach Ted Donato ’91 to both elevate his on-ice play and hone the mental toughness required of elite goaltenders.
“There were times this season when I felt like I was kind of out of it,” Madsen said. “Having to find a way to get back into it is not a super easy thing to do, especially as a goalie. So I thought I came a long way in finding strength in my game.”
An exodus of seniors is the norm once the Harvard season comes to a close. Though Madsen is the first fourth-year to sign a professional contract, his announcement comes just one day after junior Ryan Donato skated in his NHL debut for the Boston Bruins.
Despite the departure of both talent and leadership—this year’s group had three senior captains—Madsen is confident that the team will continue to find ways to win.
“The next group of guys will have a really strong leadership core,” Madsen said. “We’ve got guys that have played a ton of games, whether it’s [juniors] Lewis Zerter-Gossage or [Michael] Floodstrand…. We saw this year that a lot of the underclassmen, even, were some of the leaders on this team.”
While Madsen plans to graduate on time, the statistics concentrator departed for the Coyotes’ AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, on Tuesday afternoon. Thus far, he has received no promises about appearing in the NHL but knows that call-ups can be sudden and life-changing.
“Now it’s the hard part of actually trying to make it work over a longer period of time,” the backstop said. “If…[professional hockey] was my opportunity, I think I would take it. But obviously, having a Harvard degree, I know if it didn’t really work out the way I wanted to, I have something I can come back to.”
Not the worst of fallbacks. For the time being, Madsen will give professional hockey his all. But regardless of where he ends up, one thing is certain: Merrick Madsen was an instrumental component of the Harvard hockey program’s recent success and resurgence back onto the national stage.

It’s that kind of day. You’re rushing into the doors of Sever or squishing yourself into the same revolving door at the Science Center. Even with the gift of Harvard Time, you’re running late, and your class is on the fourth floor. You could take the stairs, but leg day isn’t scheduled for another three weeks.
That leaves the elevator, a marvelous contraption—save for the unbearable types of people in them. Elevators may save you time (and fatigue), but are they worth the awkward interactions stretched out over agonizing seconds? To settle this dilemma, we have gathered some elevator pet peeves that just may convince you to take the stairs from now on.
Overcrowders
If your TF is the type to drag out the end of class and keep you in two minutes over, good luck trying to squeeze into the elevator. Even if you somehow defy the laws of physics and compact yourself in, you’ll spend the next few minutes contorted against people’s stomachs, backs, and butts, making for an uncomfortable experience for everyone.
Mouthbreathers
These lovely humans are the icing on top of the sardine cake. The only thing possibly worse than squishing against a stranger is having another stranger squish against you and audibly breathe down your neck or face. Better pray they didn’t have tuna for lunch.
Twenty-way Callers
Were you expecting a peaceful, quiet trip to the first floor, immersed in only your thoughts? Please, these are self-absorbed Harvard students we’re talking about. Expect to be roped into the angry rant of the girl on her phone next to you, or an intimidating business call from Mr. Goldman Sachs. You’ll reach your destination, but you’ll emerge from the elevator with a disconcerting amount of personal information you never asked for.
Button Mashers
If you've ever actually encountered one of these, I’m truly sorry. Do you want to talk about it?
Malfunctions
Imagine rising from your seat in Cabot Library at 4 a.m., eyes bleary, soul absent. By then, you’re too drained to even attempt to take the stairs to turn in your pset, so you opt for the elevator. You’re relishing the peace of an empty elevator...until it shudders to a stop somewhere between the third and fourth floor. As someone who has personally experienced this scenario, it’s not fun.
Awkward Encounters
The silent interactions between you and the only other person in the elevator are a true testament to human connection. You can try your hardest to avoid eye contact, you can grimace that ~stranger to stranger smile~, or you can force out small talk, but the palpable awkwardness will still sit in the air. No getting around this one; it's simply a race to see who can exit the elevator—and the awkward encounter—first.
So what’s more appealing? Awkward eye contact and invasions of personal space, or 30 seconds of physical strain? You know the answer.
