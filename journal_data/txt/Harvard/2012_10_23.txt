“We will probably die young,” predicts Joe Coughlin, Boston-bred gangster and main character of “Live by Night.” In his 10th novel, prolific scribe of crime and mystery Dennis Lehane delivers a violent, hard-edged look at the inner workings and consequences of organized crime during Prohibition. This is a world of hard-hearted men and alluring women, moonshine and speakeasies, opulent wealth and moral privation. It is also fertile ground for literary exploration, and Lehane relentlessly drives the action forward as he rotates through robbery, blackmail, and murder by chapter. He makes an effort to weave an undercurrent of emotional development into this crime story, but come up slightly short. In the end, “Live by Night” is best read as an imaginative gangster drama, one where the heists and characters are as vivid and surprising as they come.
From the outset of the novel, Lehane establishes that he’s back in his familiar territory of Boston crime. Indeed, “Live by Night” serves as an informal sequel to his previous novel “The Given Day,” which focused on Joe’s brother Danny’s involvement in the 1919 Boston police strike. Danny barely qualifies as a secondary character in “Live by Night,” though—he’s moved out to Hollywood to make his fortune—and Lehane’s focus is firmly on Joe, the youngest son of a prominent police commissioner. After a lifetime of petty crime culminating in a dangerous bank robbery lands him in the Charleston Penitentiary, Joe aligns himself with Boston’s most dangerous crime boss-cum-rum-distributor. Lehane makes an uncharacteristic but ultimately enlivening decision to move the rest of the book’s action down to the Gulf of Mexico; in freeing himself from his traditional Boston locale, his exploration of crime and punishment in Tampa rings more violent and surprising than it has in a long time.
This change of locale invigorates his descriptions of the criminal underworld. Joe’s early life has a ring of sensationalism about it as he alternately ducks and swaggers through the burnished, corrupt Boston of the 1920s. “In Charlestown,” Lehane writes, “they brought .38s to the dinner table, used the barrels to stir their coffee.” Blood is spilled in obscene amounts at the Penitentiary, industry colors the sky and buildings a perpetual grey-brown palette, and the entire atmosphere reeks of claustrophobic suspicion. It’s almost as though Lehane has recognized the tropes inherent in his own works and amped them up at the novel’s outset, giving the reader the opportunity to beg for release. Are citizens really stirring their cream and caffeine with firearms? Does it matter? This is the Boston of stereotypical imagination. Lehane lets his narrative breathe when Joe hops a train to Tampa following his release, and his subsequent metamorphosis from an arrogant, skittish small-time outlaw to a commanding, shrewd boss is one of the greatest rewards the novel contains.
Tampa, at least as Lehane imagines it, is a city in which extremes of human behavior are believable. Nothing in Tampa—especially in Ybor City, the immigrant-filled neighborhood that Joe adopts as his headquarters—can be done small. Enemies are not just racist, they’re card-carrying members of the KKK; a bright-eyed girl that leaves town to try her luck in California doesn’t just return as a failed actress, but as a heroin addict and prostitute, too. Lehane’s portrayal of Tampa, in all its searing sunshine, trigger-happy drug cartels, and free-flowing booze, provides such a visceral image that it is a perfect stage against which the narrative can unfold.
While Lehane successfully masters the timbre of the city, his portrayal of Joe’s burgeoning emotional maturity leaves something to be desired. Joe starts off on a quest for vengeance after his girlfriend in Boston is murdered. Though he later finds love in Tampa, the sway both women hold over him is never fully explicated. Joe is willing to to lay his life on the line for those he loves, but this love is thinly developed and lacks the emotional depth to make this devotion credible.
In addition, Joe’s true motivation to pursue this high-stakes lifestyle may remain obscured for too long. “I’m not going to live some life where I pay my fucking taxes and fetch the boss a lemonade at the company picnic and buy life insurance,” Joe asserts at the beginning of the novel, but the origin of his beliefs are unclear. Immediate retribution for his lover’s murder is plausible in the short-term, but Lehane ultimately chooses to hint at rather than reveal Joe’s depth of character for a long time. By the time Joe engages in some long-awaited self-reflection—“The truth of himself,” he admits, “was a lonely boy in an empty house, waiting for someone to knock on his bedroom door and ask if he was okay”—it may be too little, too late. Nevertheless, Lehane’s decision to withhold a good deal of Joe’s heart and vulnerability for the last third of the novel is intriguing; this character shift, while not as compelling as his one to a crime boss, is undeniably more realistic and relatable.
“Live by Night” is ultimately a tale of the insane highs and stunning lows that men can ride out in their quest for immortality and recognition, and the final realization for one man that these ephemeral experiences pale compared to true love. “We live by night and dance fast so the grass can’t grow under our feet,” Joe is reminded at the end of the book, but through the subtle shift he has undergone throughout the novel, his rejection of this ideal is ultimately plausible. Lehane has always been good at detective stories, but it is his foray here into the changing morals of a criminal that flex his literary muscles. “Live by Night” is taut with a heart, and if that heart is still evolving, Lehane just might master it in his next novel.

Our generation saw a fictional, bespectacled boy grow up through seven years of magical melodrama, but the most important evolution in the Potterverse is that of its benevolent creator, J. K. Rowling. The fearfully anticipated reception of “The Casual Vacancy” has largely served to prove that Rowling will not be a one-hit wonder—even though it is unclear if fans will latch onto phrases depicting the depths of romantic despair such as “with an ache in his heart and his balls” like they did Snape’s tragic “always.” But at Lincoln Center in New York City last Tuesday, during her only public appearance for “The Casual Vacancy” in the United States, it became clear that, while Rowling has chosen the path of “grown-up” literature rather than the young adult variety for this latest project, children’s literature remains an area she wishes to explore.
The excitement of the audience, dressed in Potter paraphernalia and screaming and cheering when the introducer merely said “J.K. Rowling,” was nothing compared to that of moderator Ann Patchett flipping maniacally through dozens of note cards with the knowledge that she had 50 minutes to commune with the publishing industry’s savior. “You have done more for reading than anyone in my life,” Patchett said. “Way too much responsibility,” countered Rowling. What followed was seven minutes of rapid-fire praise and gracious acknowledgment in kind, despite Patchett’s futile legitimization attempt: “I’m not a nice person. I’m not going to sit up here and compliment you. But…” When the actual question session began, most of Patchett’s centered around Rowling’s writing process while the audience focused on differences between the Potter series and “The Casual Vacancy.”
For Rowling, the largest difficulty with “The Casual Vacancy” was reconciling the structure with a rapidly shifting point of view. “The challenge [with “The Casual Vacancy”] was the structure of the book, and I put a huge amount of work into that,” Rowling said. “The tricky thing is not showing your workings, for the reader never to realize how difficult it was. And that’s what took me the better part of five year.... I had complicated diagrams, strange little notes…cryptic things…I had to remind myself what the hell I was talking about.” Patchett then asked her if notes for “The Casual Vacancy” as well as Potter would “go to Oxford or up a chimney.” Rowling admitted that she had organized all of her notes,. “I sorted them all out, not for posterity, but for me in case I wanted to weep,” to Patchett’s pithy retort, “We call that the crying box.”
Rowling loves to write and doodle on paper, but she admitted that the advent of digital technology has been a boon to her creativity. “The MacBook Air changed my life. I’ve written everywhere, including some strange places,” she said. For Rowling, writing spots during the Potter era varied from The Elephant House cafe, with its backroom view of Edinburgh Castle (re: Hogwarts) to the five-star Balmoral Hotel, only a ten-minute walk away from her house. She also utilized the power of social media and web design with the creation of Pottermore, an interactive Harry Potter website.
Rowling also made heavy mention of her newest book’s focus on class and economic issues. “I think that I’ve had a very odd life and that I’ve moved through, economically speaking, virtually every variation you can have. The three years that I lived on what you [Americans] would call welfare was a hugely formative experience in my life. And it left me with several abiding feelings about how we talk about the poor…and being poor, which can be a humiliating experience,” she said. “All of that experience, though this is not a biography or memoir, could be used in this book.”
Patchett and Rowling, who both married doctors, found common ground in discussing their husbands’ input and reactions to their writing. For “The Casual Vacancy,” Rowling’s husband, Neil Murray, was the only one whom she trusted with the script.  “[During the writing of Harry Potter], he’s the one person who didn’t ask me why Harry had the Marauder’s Map in the ‘Order of the Phoenix’ because it had been confiscated in ‘Goblet of Fire.’” She also joked with Patchett about being worried about the reception of novels in progress. “If a writer says, ‘I have an idea. It’s two frogs in a bucket,’ you say, ‘That’s a great idea!’ Writers are thin-skinned.”
At Patchett’s prodding near the end of the night, Rowling told the audience that she plans for her next project to be another children’s book, this one targeted at children slightly younger than the Harry Potter set. Despite this less mature audience, she wants to explore concepts of fear more than fantasy. “I do remember seeing a man on TV.... He said, ‘The important thing is we must protect children from their own imaginations’.... And I thought that was the most dangerous statement. If you are saying to someone, ‘The thing that’s in your imagination is wrong and dangerous and bad,’ I think you’re saying to that child, ‘You are wrong and dangerous and bad.’ You must allow them to get that out and talk about it, feel it, and then dissipate it.”
At the end of the night, audience members received copies of “The Casual Vacancy” and stood in line for six-second moments with Rowling as she scrawled her name on the title page oftheir copies. Her treatment of writers in “Harry Potter” centered on the pompous fraud Gilderoy Lockhart and the saccharine muckraking of Rita Skeeter; fittingly, Rowling’s brief addresses—mere snatches of phrases, hundreds of hushed “Thank Yous” in dozens of inflections—showed the contrast between the writer who merely has fame and one who actually makes an impact on the lives of the readers.

"Back to Blood" by Tom Wolfe
Never have I seen a sky orange enough to be absolutely complementary with the blue of the ocean, yet on the cover of a book, that color scheme certainly does have a sort of “pop.” This is, perhaps, why reality was momentarily suspended to permit the sky and ocean to not only be unrealistically saturated, but also striped. And this is not to mention the magenta cityscape that divides the sky from the water. There is no natural phenomenon that could possibly cause largely grayscale structures to be perceived by the human eye as magenta; yet this design, with its harsh lines and urban skyline, carries with it the certainty that this book has not the slightest hint of fantasy. It’s eye-catching, but one would imagine it being eye-catching in an airport terminal shop. It is likely that a tale of a man attempting to find himself in an anticlimactically gray city will certainly entertain the business people who really couldn’t care less what color the skyline is.
"Astray" by Emma Donoghue
Has a new Austen novel been discovered? Pastel blues and patterned, silhouetted figures on horseback are distinctly symptomatic of publishers’ attempts to make classics appear modern and appealing to the general public, and perhaps they’ve gotten to this new work before someone like Penguin could inject a bit more class into the whole affair. Yet sans-Austen context, this is a book one would pick up in a shop and examine more closely, if only to decide whether or not the pattern on the figure is really a map. The bits of lake where a non-silhouetted horse’s hooves would be are a nice touch—more creative than what the Austen-perverters could think up. Of course, if this book is in fact an “Inception”-like tale of the man on horseback discovering himself while he discovers the (potentially Regency-era) world, this is probably the novel’s most creative aspect.
"Maidenhair" by Mikhail Shishkin
The title’s resemblance to “maidenhead” combined with the predominance of red on the book’s cover are a bit disconcerting, although maybe something has been lost in translation (or I’ve just been reading too much “A Song of Ice and Fire”). So perhaps this is a book about virginity—or perhaps it is about the Red Cross, seeing as its symbol is so blatantly emblazoned on the cover. But a book about the Red Cross would surely be too real, too brutal even, to permit a cover design involving lacey white flowers—and why would someone in Russia write about the Red Cross? Of course, this design is shared with the Swiss flag, which admittedly is a far more logical proposition.

The classic horror movie trope in which a wide-eyed, bare-kneed girl descends into a basement finds its warped reflection in one of the earliest scenes of “Sinister.” In lieu of a comely lass, the audience is offered a bearded, bespectacled Ethan Hawke clambering up the stairs into the attic of his new home. This inversion exemplifies the film’s best moments—it plays with tradition without being distracted from the film’s true goal—to scare.  “Sinister” is not claiming to be a groundbreaking rewrite of the genre like “Cabin in the Woods.” Instead, it offers up a wholesome tale of serial killing and ancient child-eating demons and does an admirable job of making its audience shriek like infants.
“Sinister” follows the once-successful true-crime writer Ellison Osborne through his last-ditch attempt to salvage his writing career and produce another great work. Ellison chases down the story of an entire family, save one, who were hung to death from a tree in their backyard. The last member of the family—the youngest daughter—was never found. In a hubristic, but unsurprising move, Ellison relocates his own family into the now vacant house. He discovers a box of home videos in the attic, all of which contain remarkably gruesome records of other families across the country being burned, stabbed, and drowned to death labeled with innocuous titles such as “BBQ” and “Pool Party.” In the first of his many moments of requisite horror-film idiocy, Ellison declines to call the police, and movie begins to earn its title of “Sinister.”
For a film that hinges on family values and features so many family units in various stages of life and death, the interpersonal relationships in Ellison’s home are the surprisingly the weakest part of the movie. The relationship between Ellison and his long-suffering wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) is especially tiresome as they vacillate between moments of half-hearted chemistry and poorly choreographed screaming matches that are mostly Hawke bellowing about artistic dignity. Hawke shines much more brightly in his solitary moments, swigging scotch and gritting his teeth as he simultaneously ponders the horror of serial murder and how much money he can make writing about it.
Poor family dynamics aside, “Sinister” is best when it touches on the clichés of the horror movie genre and refreshes them with an enthusiasm free from sarcasm. Halfway through the film, Ellison finds his campy sidekick in a policeman, played by the earnest-eyed James Ransome, who introduces himself as a die-hard fan, and who Ellison calls “Deputy So-and-So.” Ransome’s character, sweet and twitchy, delivers occasional moments of comic relief throughout the film. When Ellison complains of menacing stomping sounds emanating from his attic, Ransome’s response is to verbally catalogue the animals that might be in the attic that have feet and could thus make stomping sounds—squirrels, yes. Snakes, no.
The most intriguing parts of the movie are the “found film” elements—those home records that Ellison finds and then watches obsessively for clues. Each film has its own narrative, beginning with the family still alive and ending with them less so. In each case, the murderer is off-screen, holding the camera and lighting fires or dragging knives over throats. Each film is a minor work of horror unto itself, and the enthusiasm with which Derrickson approaches the creation and exposition of these vignettes carries “Sinister” safely past the realm of schlock and marks it as a horror movie that can hold its own within the over-saturated genre.
Although Director Scott Derrickson’s new work doesn’t awe, it offers enough shock and punch to keep watchers from giggling at the standard horror movie absurdities that it sometimes employs by necessity. Dark attics, psycho killers, demons, children who paint things and stare dead-eyed at their parents—these tropes are far from unique, but “Sinister” keeps these otherwise cheap scares effective with a dose of sincerity and a healthy sense of play.

Let’s set the record straight. Kendrick Lamar’s new album, “good kid, m.A.A.d. city” is not a debut, at least not in the traditional sense. The 25-year old phenom has been in the game for the greater part of nine years, a period that’s seen him release five mixtapes, an EP, and a full-length digital album, all the while honing his chops on collabs with the likes of Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, and Lamar’s idol, Dr. Dre.
Dre is well known as a mentor to young MCs, but Lamar is a special project for the hip-hop legend—both teacher and student share Compton roots. And as Dre ushers Lamar into major-label stardom, the pupil turns his attention back home. On “good kid, m.A.A.d. city,” he creates a musical landscape of the town he grew up in, casting himself in an autobiographical drama. It’s a work made vivid by Lamar’s blistering flow and chameleonic voice, but made unforgettable by his challenging of the conventions of gangsta rap, whose canon “good kid, m.A.A.d. city” both joins and transcends
Lamar’s lyrics often meditate on the fetters that his community placed on him, and “The Art of Peer Pressure” offers a sobering view of these restraints. “I never was a gangbanger / I mean I never was stranger to the folk neither,” says Lamar, playing the role of an innocent youth who is nevertheless dragged into a life of crime by “the homies.” The story comes at us rapid-fire; Lamar’s stream of words roll over a beat that chugs like a locomotive, hurtling the tale of robbery and deception further and further toward its sunless conclusion.
Though “The Art of Peer Pressure” depicts a tragedy, Lamar generally avoids the outright preachiness that dominates the work of many of his “socially conscious” colleagues. “Swimming Pools (Drank)” will most likely garner the most radio play out of any of the tracks, but not because it’s the best. Superficially, the track is standard pop-rap fare. The ear-catching vocal hook, backed by punchy orchestral accents, is a seemingly unabashed party anthem that bounces over a beat of tinny hisses and Soulja-Boy-like snare drum “whops.” But the track most ready for consumption is actually an essay on consumption of another sort. Lamar displays a refreshing thoughtfulness as he reflects on the pervasiveness of alcohol in urban youth culture: “Some people like the way it feels / Some people wanna kill their sorrows / Some people wanna fit in with the popular / That was my problem.” The song even guest-stars Lamar as his own conscience, who, in a pitched-up and nimble voice, warns the rapper of the party-hard lifestyle so commonly touted by his less pensive peers. Lamar is always making a statement, but his ability to sneak his messages into seemingly simple pop tunes keeps things from being heavy-handed.
Sometimes it seems Lamar is outright mocking the shallower practitioners of his genre. “m.A.A.d. city,” a look at Compton’s harshest side, is clearly meant to be disturbing, but its comically simplistic beat and furious synth-violin riff, repetitive enough to derange, can only be a dark caricature of what Lamar associates with his violent compatriots. And in a moment of self-parody—perhaps a jab at other agile-tongued performers as well—Lamar, in the middle of a seemingly endless stream of verbage on “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst,” literally fades himself out mid-rhyme. He knows all too well that a barrage of words without substance is practically an invitation for the listener to tune out.
Though the album is driven by its heavier material, Lamar decides to end on a joyful note with the exuberant closer, “Compton.” Dre shows up for this afterparty and spends the four minute celebration trading verses with Lamar, as the two rappers laud the rich hip-hop culture of their hometown and congratulate one another on their triumphs. The production, while warm but spacious on the rest of the album, is given a last-minute jolt by Just Blaze to match the thriving energy of the rappers. The blaring brass resembles a fanfare, signifying that we’re in the presence of hip-hop royalty; Lamar, entering princedom, just might inherit the throne someday.

Titus Andronicus have found their Nietzsche. “I think that now we’ve established everything is inherently worthless,” proclaims lead singer Patrick Stickles in the first words of the New Jersey indie/punk band’s new album, “Local Business.” Stickles may be convinced, but he’s missing the fact that the album is about as far away from being inherently worthless as possible. Instead, it’s a triumphant success—a riveting, confrontational album in which immense energy collides with wrenchingly bitter lyrics to produce magnificent results.
On “Local Business,” Titus Andronicus mostly stick to the musical formula of their critically acclaimed Civil War concept album “The Monitor” (2010): taking vaguely Irish and 19th-century American-sounding major key melodies and building them into riff-based rock reminiscent of early British punk. However, this time around, they ramp up the intensity. The guitar riffs are even more blistering, Eric Harm’s drumming is even more torrential, and Stickles’ snarling vocals produce an extraordinary number of decibels and still hold a tune at the same time.
The band’s unparalleled musical energy is a main factor in elevating “Local Business” beyond standard three-chord rock. The group thrusts each song in your face, blocking out all other sensory stimulation: the album is probably the worst background music of all time. This is best exemplified on two of the album’s standout songs—“Still Life With Hot Deuce On Silver Platter” and “Upon Viewing Oregon’s Landscape With The Flood of Detritus.” Neither song possesses an incredibly unique melody (the swaggering blues-rock coda that closes “Still Life” is imported directly from E Street), but the ferocity with which Titus Andronicus tear into them is singularly infectious. These are songs you’ll happily destroy your speakers on—the louder you play them, the better they sound.
However, “Local Business” gets even better when Stickles’ lyrics get personal. The album’s best song, “My Eating Disorder,” is about Stickles’ lifelong battle with selective eating disorder and features brutally personal lyrics throughout: “It’s probably easier just to eat at home / Better I should wait until I’m all alone / Then I stuff myself until I explode.” When this painful topic is coupled with Titus Andronicus’ musical energy, Stickles’ struggle feels all the more tangible. Album closer “Tried to Quit Smoking” is a slow ballad in which Stickles howls some of the bitterest lyrics he’s ever penned: “It’s not that I wanted to hurt you / I just didn’t care if I did… It is not that I do not love you / It’s just that I hate everyone.” The band’s choice to include these lyrics in a ballad, rather than in an up-tempo song, forces the listener to confront what Stickles’ difficult words.
Aside from “Tried to Quit Smoking,” the album’s other slow songs have slightly more mixed results. Because Titus Andronicus’ energy is such an integral part of their identity, tempering it is a risky move. The stylistic switch pays off on “(I Am The) Electric Man,” written by Stickles in the hospital after he was accidentally and severely electrocuted during a rehearsal. The song, definitely more of a hand-clapper than a head-banger, explores funky new frontiers for the band, featuring R&B-style backup singers with which Stickles has hilarious back-and-forths. However, the band is much less successful on the tepid and overlong “In A Small Body,” which, at six minutes, lacks both energy and powerful lyrics.
However, this is a small quibble. “Local Business” is superb, a musical achievement that’s at its best when it deals with, well, local business—Stickles’ eating disorder, electrocution, and the poor soul on the receiving end of “Tried to Quit Smoking.” On their third album, Titus Andronicus have achieved exactly what one of their track titles proclaims—a third round knockout.

The Taming of the Shrew
Oct. 25-27 7:30 p.m., Oct. 28 2:00p.m.,
Nov. 7-8 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by Simone E. Polanen ’14 Produced by Hannah R. Phillips ’15
and Gökcan Demirkazik ’14
Love, marriage, and a little bit of comedy go a long way in making Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew” an over-the-top farce. Set in Padua, Italy, the play follows the story of ambitious gold digger Petruchio as he sets out to find a wealthy heiress to marry. However, he ends up getting more than he bargained for when he is set up with the wealthy but tenacious Katherina. Most of the characters in the show are men, and during Shakespeare’s time, all shows were put on using only male actors. However, director Simone E. Polanen ’14, decided to use an all-female cast—for all the roles—with the hope of turning this gender dynamic on its head. “I think a woman’s interpretation of a male character is a lot different than a male’s interpretation, so I think that this show brings out some new and interesting takes on the play,” she says.
Polanen has decided to do a modern rendition of the classic; she kept the old-fashioned language and plot but changed the setting to post-World-War-II United States. Alice F. Berenson ’16, who plays the role of Hortensio, believes this was a great choice because it allows the play to comment on how women’s roles have changed since the time the play was written. “With women playing men, you can actually play it to the extreme,” she says. “In one scene, [Petruchio] is making lewd comments that coming from a man would be inappropriate, but coming from a woman just highlight the gender dynamics of the play and show how outdated they are.”
Throughout the entire show, the cast hopes to dispel gender stereotypes. Olivia L. Ball ’14, who plays Petruchio, sees this directorial decision as a comment on how our society deals with gender issues. “In this play, a man treats a woman pretty terribly, and the one thing we’ve tried to bring out is that women don’t treat each other that way,” she says. “It’s really a comment on how women are supposed to behave by the bending of all the gender rules.”
Overall, through its unconventional choices and over-the-top comedic approach, HRDC’s “The Taming of the Shrew” promises to be interesting and exciting for both seasoned Shakespeare veterans and those who have never even heard of the play.

Lucien D. Werner ’13 was four when he first learned to play the cello and has been passionate about music ever since. He and his three sisters formed the “Werner Chamber Quartet,” and together they have performed in France, Austria, Holland, Italy, and Carnegie Hall in New York. When he’s not jet-setting across the globe, Werner is the music director and conductor of Harvard’s Bach Society Orchestra and the president of the Brattle Street Chamber Players. Werner led the BSO in their first concert of the season on Saturday October 20 at 8pm in Paine Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: How has Harvard shaped your interaction with music?
Lucien D. Werner: I’ve played music for my whole life. I had the good fortune to grow up in a musical family. It was a very natural thing, and it was just something we all loved doing. I got more serious about it in high school but didn't apply to conservatory because I wanted a university liberal-arts education. But when I got here (to my surprise) there was an incredible music community filled with many fantastic players: people who are passionate about music and think intelligently about music at a really high level. I started conducting when I came here, and it has been a great growth experience for me. There are these orchestras that need student music directors, so there is a wealth of opportunities to explore music and to do it a really high level.
THC: How is conducting music different from playing it?
LDW: Conducting is a very strange thing. It is a beast I don’t totally understand, and it’s a less direct relationship with the production of sound and music than [what] you have playing an instrument. I’m a cellist primarily, and when I sit there with a cello, there’s a very direct way of placing the bow on the string: you draw it, the string vibrates, and you have sound. With conducting, you’re up there moving your arms, making your gestures and facial expressions, and somehow that translates into these incredible sounds the people in the orchestra play. For me, it is not as intuitive as playing an instrument, but what you can do with it is incredible. To get 50 to 60 people [to play] together and to think the same way...is quite incredible...when we get it to work.
THC: In what ways does BachSoc interpret the music it plays as something new and fresh?
LDW: I’m of the view that every performance has something unique about it. Maybe that’s as obvious as, “Oh it’s being played now in this space for these people by these people.” So there is a way to be unique. We can do conscious things to affect our interpretation. We may want to take a particular piece at a certain tempo, or I might decide I want to hear it slower, so we’ll hold it back. I might have a vision for how I want this piece to sound or what effect I want it to leave, which is very different from what another conductor might do. There’s one piece that we’re doing this concert cycle by Wagner, “Siegfried Idyll,” which is a piece written by the German composer for his wife on the occasion of the birth of his first son. Some conductors might think of it as a lullaby, like the child is sleeping with his mother and everything is peaceful. Or it can be a more boisterous occasion and the piece is about his joy. Music has so many dimensions to it. You can really take an active role in what you want to highlight.
THC: What are the major themes for the music of this past performance?
LDW: I tried to find connections and interesting links between the works to put them in context. Music is not written in a vacuum. It is an entire historical, cultural context. All these composers are immensely aware of what came before them and what was going on around them. I really wanted to keep that in mind. So I selected pieces that have interesting structural connections....We have a progression of German music from Bach, the father of Western tonal music, followed by Haydn who invented a lot of these forms. He invented the genre of the symphony itself. It did not exist before Haydn codified it in his 100 compositions of the symphony type. Then Wagner brought tonal music to the edge where he took harmony and dissonance as far as it could go until it was unclear whether or not  it could go further. And then Webern took it all the way and developed the 12-tone system, which abandoned traditional harmony and brought us into this completely new sonic world.
THC: What has been your favorite musical experience at Harvard?
LDW: It has nothing to do with classical music. My freshman year, some people in my dorm and I formed a band called “Ki Ken Tai Ichi.” I was playing electric guitar and electric cello. Electric cello sounds pretty cool when you hook it up to a guitar amp. We had one rehearsal and went into the freshman Battle of the Bands, and we surprisingly ended up winning. It was just this crazy experience where none of us were rock musicians but we just got together and decided to have some fun. I’d say that was one of the most memorable things. Maybe not the highest quality, but definitely something I’ll remember.
THC: Do you plan to pursue music when you graduate?
LDW: Hopefully—that is the plan. It’s kind of a brutal and fickle world [in the music world]. I guess most things are. But I’m applying to music conservatory for cello conducting. But music will always be a part of my life in a big way. It’s just determining how and what’s the best path to get there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Within five minutes of sitting down at Pavement, it’s easy to tell that this coffeehouse is much different than Pamplona, Peet’s, or any other place in Harvard Square. While you might hear conversations about calculus or organic chemistry on the Northern side of the Charles, everything at Pavement centers around music. Only here, at the heart of the Berklee College of Music campus, will you find students singing lines from classical pieces in order to prove a point, arguing over guitar techniques, and expertly weaving through tables while wielding giant cello cases. It’s no wonder that R&B singer/rapper Shea Rose chose this location to be interviewed: it’s clear that here, musicians are in their element.
I had a lot of preconceptions of what Shea Rose would be like in real life before meeting her this past week. For instance, her website features a prominent naked photo of herself scowling at the camera with feathers attached to her head, so I imagined Rose having a confrontational attitude, and honestly was a little intimidated. How do you appropriately interview someone who Queen Latifah called “America’s next female rapper” without making a fool of yourself? However, when Rose sat down, my anxieties immediately dissolved. She was nothing like the bold character on her website; rather, Rose was warm, down-to-earth, and eager to share her thoughts on her music and past experiences.
Rose spent her childhood both in the urban Dorchester and the suburbs of Braintree, and her musical influences reflect this contrast. The Berklee ’11 graduate is inspired by Lauryn Hill and Tina Turner but also cites Jeff Buckley and Bob Dylan as role models. Eventually, Rose says that “all that mess in my head was embraced” when she came to Berklee. Like Pavement Coffeehouse, Berklee allows musicians of all different backgrounds to be exposed to a wide array of music. However, Rose is primarily driven by R&B. When asked about the first album that truly inspired her, Rose answers almost instantaneously with Stevie Wonder’s “Talking Book.” “He is just—free,” she gushes.
Hoping to achieve the freedom that she so admires, Rose approaches her craft with a determined purpose. “I don’t like being told what to do,” she states simply. This mindset is exemplified by her recent mixtape, “Little Warrior.” Recorded in her friends’ bedroom, “Little Warrior” gave Rose the opportunity to experiment with different genres of music on her own terms. In this makeshift studio, she was able to pursue themes most important and relevant to her: female empowerment and independence. She recalls an instance when a Berklee professor told her that people weren’t going to accept a black woman doing rock music, but later shattered the stereotype when her music appeared on a Boston rock radio station. In the studio, she hopes to further dismantle barriers. “I want to project myself as a strong woman,” she says.
While it’s clear that Rose is ambitious, she is also realistic. After revealing how she almost wanted to drop out of school after a subpar concert perforance in 2009, Rose credits “The Movement at Berklee,” a music for social change initiative as the key factor that gave her a renewed perspective on music. She wishes more people realized that there are many other career routes within the music industry besides aiming to be a superstar. “However,” she slyly concedes, in spite of her previous statements, “when you’re a performer and it burns in you, nothing can satisfy it.”
Still unable to accept her incredible leap in popularity, Rose blushes and speaks in a softer voice every time I ask her to talk about her successes during the past year and a half.  When she was named R&B/Soul/Urban Contemporary Artist of the Year at the 2011 Boston Music Awards, Rose shares how it was “almost chilling that I was there but I don’t remember the night at all.”
The once “super, super shy” singer is equally wowed by the progress of the pop-duo Karmin, who were her peers at Berklee. After expressing her amazement of the group’s year-long meteoric rise to the top of the charts, Rose is unable to imagine herself in their shoes one year into the future. “If I’m on ‘Dancing With the Stars’ in a year...” she begins, but ultimately drops the thought and changes the subject.
There is something refreshing about the obvious contrast between the fierce personality Rose portrays on stage and the incredible humbleness she exuded in person. “You don’t know if things are going to work out, and it’s tormenting,” she says. “You just have to hope the next opportunity comes from the one you’re given at the moment.”  After all, she is just a young adult working to achieve her dreams, just thousands of students on both sides of the Charles. The only difference is that Shea Rose is almost there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes society can feel like an airplane: We are all hurtling forward together, but we all sit alone. As Green (Sam B. Clark ’13) puts it during the opening monologue of “Lone Gay Male:” “The plane you’re on and the plane they’re on is not the same plane, is it?” These passionate moments of soliloquy that were interposed throughout “Lone Gay Male”—a show written and directed by Felix L. Cook ’13 that ran from October 18 to October 20 at the Loeb Ex—allowed the performance to convey intense messages and morals about the gay community of “Generation Z.” Through the story, the strength of the actors, the careful use of projection, and the soliloquies in between certain scenes are the heart of the play and communicated the intense and emotional themes.
Based on a true story, the play follows a student at Harvard and his four friends in their struggle to recover after he became the victim of a hate-crime right outside campus. The play was more a series of vignettes than a classic narrative: it moved from grungy Saturday night parties, to the mundane questions and answers of therapy, to conversations in the dhall about the ups and downs of relationships. Cook uses these moments to tear down the walls that separate the gay community from other groups. Through these snapshots of universal moments, the play communicates the idea that different communities of sexual orientation all have fundamental similarities. The fears, the laughs, and the moments of happiness and sadness all feel the same regardless of one’s self-definition.
The quality of the actors communicated this message—especially during the soliloquies. The strongest of the performances came from Clark, the tightly wound and emotionally suffocated best friend of main character and victim Red (Eli W. Pelton ’16). Clark’s monologue opened the show, and right from the start his talent shined. His facial expressions captured Green’s cynical and distraught character, who is always looking to hide his emotions from everyone. During the opening speech, the slight smile that was always at the corner of his lips and the sardonic eyebrows that were raised at all the right times brilliantly captured the emotions that were moving Green. Clark gave the impression of sitting down and talking with a close friend. His intense performance was complemented by Pelton’s. The therapy scenes were definitely Pelton’s forte. It was there that the ever-so-slight shaking of his fingers, the varying intonations of his voice, and the well placed, knowing smiles portrayed the hurt that was wracking Red in the aftermath of the attack.  Pelton’s subtle moves contrasted with with Clark’s distinct style. The result was two completely different approaches for dealing with the pain and confusion of being gay in today’s society.
The use of projected images further ingrained the societal messages of “Lone Gay Male.” Two large screens on either side of the theater framed one larger screen that lay behind the stage. Through paintings of God, snippets of pornography, and news clips of prominent people in society making ignorant remarks concerning homosexuality, the projections gave a fullness and a depth to the performances and further strengthened the communication of the show’s morals. The projections also served to enhance the set. For example, when Red was at the dentist, the screen displayed dental x-ray images to convey the feeling of actually sitting in a medical office.
From the dark events of one Harvard student’s life has sprung a production that seeks to stretch our horizons concerning sexuality. How different really are communities of different sexual orientation? Can we reconcile society’s homophobia with our emphasis on diversity?  The story, the acting, and the production of “Lone Gay Male” coalesced, and the show longs for a day where Clark and his character Green can say definitively that we are all on the same plane—together.

Any play that includes among its characters the reincarnation of F. Scott Fitzgerald is aiming to grab attention, and “Wordplays”––a new play written and directed by Crimson arts editor Nathan O. Hilgartner ‘14 that ran through Sunday the 21st at the Adams Pool Theater––did just that. But while it may bill itself as “a wry and at times provocative” play, it doesn’t deliver on that description. A lopsided cast failed to redeem the play’s repetitive script, resulting in a production that lagged where it promised to crackle with wit.
“Wordplays” is a set of three one-act plays, all of which grapple with the meaninglessness of existence. In the first work, “Block,” kindergartners Tim (Matthew J. Bialo ‘15) and Jackie (Danielle T. Lessard ‘16) experience an existential crisis when they are told to clean up the elaborate building-block racetrack they have created. Lessard’s fluid body language captured a child’s lack of self-consciousness, and her choice of a cutesy, overly babyish voice would have worn thin quickly if it didn’t create such a funny contrast with her mature lines, such as when she invoked a lapse in the space-time continuum in order to rebuild a piece of the track she had knocked over.
In keeping with the production’s existentialist themes, Tim is a sort of kindergarten Camus. Bialo deftly captured his pint-sized angst, especially when he showed how increasingly invested he was in the “world” that he created. For example, when Tim confronted Jackie after she abandons their creation, Bialo managed to capture just how wounded his character was without tipping into melodrama. Bialo and Lessard gave it their all, and the result is a solid piece of theater.
However, things began to go downhill with the second play, “And One Fine Morning.” The protagonist Janice (Lessard) is a college drop-out-turned-waitress who happens to sit down at a bus stop next to Scotty (Bialo), who thinks he’s the reincarnation of F. Scott Fitzgerald. He sits smoking and drinking Manhattans like a proper Jazz Age gentleman (although his ziplock baggy of maraschino cherries is decidedly less than dignified). Much to Janice’s chagrin, Scotty proceeds to narrate the world as it passes by. Here Bialo’s talent was more apparent than in the first play; from his first lines, he commanded the stage. And when Scotty’s smug, self-assured veneer began to give way to desperation, Bialo executed the turn with perfect precision. “Genius never ties,” Scotty exclaims toward the end of the play, but through nuanced body language Bialo let us see just how fragile Scotty’s belief in that assertion is.  The confidence and charisma of Bialo’s performance almost, but not quite, masked the fact that the play began to repeat itself and its material was far overextended.
Lessard, however, was much more unsteady in this piece. Her performance was the most believable when her character was relaxing, smoking a cigarette and lobbing teasing questions at Scotty. However, when her character was angry or on her guard, Lessard’s acting stiffened up. The aggression and irony she injected into her voice came off as forced and neutralized the chemistry that the duo were supposed to have. After their verbal skirmishes escalated into a yelling match that left both demoralized, Scotty expressed surprise that he had “cracked her shell”—but what shell? Her character was painfully simple, and Lessard’s portrayal added no depth. The strength of Bialo’s performance could’t redeem the show’s other flaws; as it’s drawn further and further out, the plot began to weaken and Lessard was unable to pick up the slack.
The final play, “The Necropolis,” is set in a South American cemetery, where an irreverent gravedigger (Joshua G. Wilson ‘13) is idly eating lunch and singing doggerel verses. It’s not long before Bialo and Lessard stepped onstage again, this time as two amnesiacs trying to figure out who they are. The gravedigger shepherds these two lost souls through their groping attempts to construct stories for themselves, sometimes serious, sometimes light-hearted. Here again Bialo outshined Lessard, projecting fear and yearning without going over the top. Lessard still had the same snarky, sardonic tone of the previous play, and this time it was utterly out of step with what the piece called for. For example, in recounting her bewildering trip through a city that she no longer recognizes, she didn’t communicate a sense of loss. Instead, she just seemed annoyed.
“Wordplays,” like its characters, has an identity crisis: it doesn’t know if it’s supposed to be funny or serious. Without a dominant tone to work with or a strong directorial hand to guide them, the actors were unmoored and none of their performances quite connect with each cother. It attempted to confront life’s biggest questions, but the play was more about missed connections than anything else: between an actor and a part, and between an idea and its execution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My senior year of high school was a tough time for me.  By that I mean First World Problems like sketchy internet connections and being unable to put my in my contacts that compounded until I felt like I existed in a state of what any SAT vocabulary book would call “malaise.” Some of my grievances were more relatable than others—I was dealing with universal problems such as unrequited love, teenage angst, and the occasional pimple that ballooned into a pus-filled monstrosity that would indelibly crush the self-esteem of any freshmen with overstuffed Jansport backpack in tow.
In order to deal with my FWPs, I took solace in simple pleasures such as procrastinating and going to bed when it was still light out. That didn’t leave much time for reading the assigned books in my senior year literature class. For every half-hearted essay about “Invisible Man,” a SparkNotes “study session” for “For Whom the Bell Tolls.”
So when my teacher assigned “The Great Gatsby,” I figured it would be the same drill: SparkNote, bullshit, repeat. But this book appealed to my laziness—it wasn’t even 200 pages. I figured I could read it in a couple hours and participate in class so that my teacher would assume I read every book she assigned. It’s not that I didn’t like reading; it just wasn’t appealing to be forced to read a book and dissect it until it was nothing more than a dozen metaphors about losing your virginity and a few symbols meaning sex. But “Gatsby” is such a life-changing book that even hour-long discussions about the importance of color in the novel couldn’t kill its brilliance.
From page one, I was engrossed by F. Scott Fitzgerald’s poetic prose and humorous wit. His characters were fascinating. Nick Carraway, the novel’s narrator, was an all-too-relatable blend of humble and snob. The book’s titular character Jay Gatsby was mysterious and tragic, and the other characters in the book were comic in their shallowness—just like some of my classmates. When I finished the book it became one of few school-assigned books that didn’t make me think, “Is this only considered a ‘classic’ because it’s old and there weren’t many books published at that time?”
If I had never picked up “Gatbsy” after my senior year, then it wouldn’t be worth mentioning; it would have just been another book that I enjoyed during high school. But this past summer I decided to reread “Gatsby” during my two-hour-long bus rides to my improv class. When I first read the book I saw it as a story about a man willing to do anything for the woman he loved, as evidenced by the poem that opens the book:
“Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;
If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,
Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,
I must have you!’”
I saw something more than a love story.
As homeless people and the merely eccentric piled onto the bus shouting obscenities and singing show tunes at the top of their lungs I sat there, shyly reading “Gatsby,” slowly and carefully. And what I found wasn’t a story about a great love but a story about a man who wanted to make something of himself, a man who invented a new name and persona and became filthy stinking rich—just like a 1920s version of Lady GaGa.
What makes great books great is their ability to seemingly apply directly to life. When I read “Gatsby” in high school, I was concerned with love, and that’s why my main takeaway was that even men in the 1920s had the same romantic problems that I do. But now, I see Jay Gatsby as a man who made himself into a legend, not just for love but for the advantages of being wealthy and successful without being born into that life.
Jay Gatsby probably shouldn’t be my literary inspiration due to the fact that his wealth came from illicit business ventures and psychotic obsession bent on recapturing missed opportunities as evidenced when he says, “Can’t repeat the past? Why of course you can!” This is a hint that one shouldn’t go through life with his philosophy, but it’s hard not to admire his unapologetically arrogant view of life.

Nestled below ground level at 52 JFK Street since 2005, Raven Used Books calls itself “one of the best scholarly used book stores in the country.” The single room inside, though a tight space, is lively and inviting: tall bookcases nearly touch the low ceiling, and overflow copies that cannot fit vertically within a shelf are enthusiastically stacked on top of other books. Raven offers a continually restocked array of hand-picked works in literature, humanities, and the natural sciences, all low-priced and in excellent condition. Outside, a cart with even cheaper scholarly books, at $2 or $3 each, awaits curious eyes. The list below represents ten of their best-selling titles.
1. Kafka on the Shore, Haruki Murakami
Jonas, a manager at Raven, says that copies of Murakami’s work are almost immediatly snatched up after they  are shelved. In this novel, Murakami’s philosophical, poetic ,and humorous re-imagining of the life of a young Kafka won him the 2006 World Fantasy Award.
2.The Archaeology of Knowledge, Michel Foucault
3.Gravity’s Rainbow, Thomas Pynchon
4.Pale Fire, Vladimir Nabokov
Considered to be the crowning work of the mature Nabokov, “Pale Fire” is one of the earliest metatexual novels. Pair that with the same linguistic fireworks that made his better-known “Lolita” more than the confessions of a middle-aged pedophile, and you have this humorous, humane masterpiece.
5. War and Peace, Leo Tolstoy
6. The Pleasure of the Text, Roland Barthes
7. Philosophical Investigations, Ludwig Wittgenstein
8. The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoevsky
9. Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, Giorgio Agamben
10. Being and Time, Martin Heidigger

In the opening scene of “The Lily’s Revenge,” is a staring contest between the audience and a clock. The character of Time, played by Samantha Eggers, sports a black dress in the form of an hourglass and a cuckoo clock on her head. After a few moments of gazing at the crowd before her, Time addresses the audience with not a welcome, but a warning: “This play is long,” she says. “In fact, this play will be much longer than advertised.”
Long, indeed, it is. With a running time of about four hours and twenty minutes, The American Repertory Theater’s production of “The Lily’s Revenge,” in residence at OBERON until October 28th, is certainly an epic dramatic piece. Playwright Taylor Mac’s five-act phantasmagorical creation is an ambitious blend of music, poetry, operetta, drag, and dance. Through the allegorical tale of a Lily—an anthropomorphic flower played by Mac himself)—who seeks to escape social confines by marrying a human bride, the show challenges tradition and social convention. Though at times drawn out and overly gaudy, “The Lily’s Revenge” can be praised for its high production quality and impressive scope that successfully create an interactive theatrical experience.
In Act I, Time states her mission: to bring an end to “institutionalized nostalgic narrative.” Instead of trying to view life through the lens of the past, she encourages society to take pleasure in what is real in the world, in the here and now. Time’s wishes are challenged by nostalgia and tradition, which are manifested by a villainous stage curtain called The Great Longing (Thomas Derrah). With devilish expressions and a despotic demeanor, The Great Longing tries to force the other characters to stage a classic wedding, the quintessential representation of tradition. The Lily aims to aid Time in the battle against the Curtain’s views of tradition by replacing the groom in the wedding. and marrying the bride.
The diverse means of expression are the production’s greatest sources of strength. Mac and director Shira Milikowsky collaborate to put forth brilliant displays of  theatricality. Act III momentarily brings the audience out of the Lily’s story with an abstract dream ballet performed by Bride Love (Marisa Fratto) and Groom Love (Samson Kohanski) in which the previously glorified vision of marriage described by The Great Longing  is questioned. The couple’s dance is a roller coaster of sex, abuse, fighting, and forgiving; in this dance the negative elements of marriage are explored for the first time.
Another moment of dramatic expertise occurs in the third act, when The Great Longing performs a striptease to represent the fall of tradition and his loss of control of the narrative. Derrah sheds his red velvet curtain costume to reveal a scanty g-string—symbolizing his newfound insecurity. Moments later, he regains control when he beats the actors of the ballet and forces them to dress him by pasting red cocktail napkins onto his bare body. Each napkin has a word or phrase that represents a typical human aspiration. This action continues in silence for a few moments, until the curtain is rebuilt and the act ends.
Breaking up the Lily’s five-act saga are three interactive intermissions. Unlike traditional breaks, the interludes at “The Lily’s Revenge” are all about audience participation. As the audience exit the theater, they are greeted by cast members who might lead them to their dressing room, offer a massage, compose a haiku, or invite unsuspecting viewers to a tea party. Even upon entering the bathroom,  they are serenaded by a cast member in full costume. There is no time to stop, think, complain, or even check your watch. These engaging intermissions coupled with several instances of audience participation during the performance (warning: you may get licked by a flower), does well to make this piece of epic theater a truly interactive event.
In Act IV, Mac as the Lily stands center stage and tells as standing audience—at this point all the chairs have been removed—that he wishes to create community theater. Though the show is drawn out and very over-the-top, “The Lily’s Revenge” does succeed in creating an environment where the actors and the audience are able to directly interact with each other. Maybe the Lily has succeeded in creating the community he is trying so hard to bring to life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past decade, Flying Lotus has recklessly yet purposefully swerved across musical lanes, integrating elements of jazz, neo-soul, trip-hop, and electronic into a distinctively hip-hop aesthetic. A devout disciple of renowned Detroit hip-hop producer J Dilla and great-nephew of cultish jazz experimentalist Alice Coltrane, wife to jazz giant John Coltrane, Lotus (government name: Steven Ellison) is a human musical depository, the type who heedlessly devours stacks of records, regurgitating them into quirky mp3s. He effortlessly glides among genres, with his signature skittish percussion often standing as the sole landmark in his romping musical explorations.
In his 2010 release, “Cosmogramma,” Ellison let himself ascend almost too far into this cacophonous, cluttered sonic stratosphere, often absconding completely from melodic concerns for the sake of exposing his technical savvy. At this point, he has arguably transcended the title of hip-hop producer, and for that matter all other measures of genre. If “Cosmogramma” was Lotus’ technical tour de force, then his latest release “Until the Quiet Comes” is the scaling down of his sample attention deficit disorder for the sake of a more pared down, melodically digestible offering.
A Pitchfork documentary filmed in August at the magazine’s annual showcase festival in Chicago captures a pre-show FlyLo (as he is affectionately known in music circles) giddily hopping between backstage and muddy gen-pop crowds to secure himself enough marijuana to fill an Altoids case (which he describes as “not quite the Pulp Fiction briefcase”). On the topic of his then unreleased “Until the Quiet Comes,” Ellison remarked, “I feel like I’ve worked the hardest I’ve ever worked on a record this time around. I tried to trim the fat in a lot of instances, and I tried to just keep everything focused. It was kind of a challenge for me to pull back and strip things down.” As if to echo his youthful behavior at the Pitchfork festival, Ellison described his reductionist approach even more directly in “The Wire” magazine, claiming that he designed “Until the Quiet Comes” to be “a children’s record, a record for kids to dream to.”
Listening to “Until the Quiet Comes” is like entering an abandoned townhouse in a post-industrial city and shuffling through each past resident’s old belongings: it is at once playful and eerie, ecstatic and melancholy. Lotus explores a diverse collection of melodic themes, refracting them through grating, dissonant synths, frenetic drum patterns, and dissected vocal samples. Indeed, the defining feature of this album relative to Lotus’ past work is his unrelenting focus on melody, a feature which was previously either sequestered below layers of curiously arranged samples or punctuated by hard-hitting drums. These fleeting moments of infectious melody are always intruded upon by more dissonant musical tangents, as if to thwart the listener from settling into any single mood. He giveth and he taketh away, but what he gives gets stuck in your head—for weeks on end.
The album is best listened to front-to-back; I had to become accustomed to this experience while endlessly streaming it on NPR in the week prior to its official release. That said, there are several highlights worth noting—moments that I futilely scrambled to replay on my iPhone. On “Sultan’s Request,” FlyLo starts with an infectiously heavy synth melody, eventually sprinkling oscillating variations on the melody before it drops into a heavily swung rhythm that recalls a late-nineties J. Dilla beat. “Putty Boy Strut” is arguably the album’s lightest moment; Lotus infantilizes an adult’s voice and augments it with heavily textured vox generators, eventually yielding something as close to a playground anthem as the so-called “childrens’ album” gets. On “See Thru To U” featured artist Thundercat chants, “Dream of love and light and laughter,” over a lush, fuzzy Rhodes keyboard arrangement, which eventually drops into the album’s most rhythmically engaging offering. On “Electric Candyman,” Lotus’ moaning, fuzzy synths undergird Thom Yorke’s ethereal, bleary repeated commands of, “Look into the mirror, and look into the mirror and say my name.” The emotional tenor of the album reaches a fever pitch on “Me Yesterday//Corded,” when Lotus strips everything down to a stilted and distorted piano loop. “Getting There,” featuring Niki Randa, is as close to vintage FlyLo as the album dares to venture. It is also the centerpiece in the enigmatic Kahlil Joseph-directed short film sampling various tracks from the album.
If the album were to have any drawback for Lotus’ devoted audience, it would likely be that he has, for the most part, abandoned his characteristically raw hip-hop drums in favor of melodic explorations. That said, the album still carries the same moodiness that his prior work unapologetically pursued. This is headphone music at its best, meant to be enjoyed on a late night bus ride home from work, or in tandem with a cigarette outside Lamont during a long night of writing.

In many Asian languages, the verb “to read” translates in two ways: one, signifying reading aloud; the other, reading in silence. In Chinese, for example, 读 means to read out loud, with the radical on the left-hand side, 讠, signaling an association with speech. On the other hand, 看 means to read in silence. It also means to look at, and the rectangle with two lines across it,目, means “eyes.” The distinction is somewhat fluid: 读 can often be used interchangeably to mean reading out loud and in silence, though 看 can never be used to indicate reading aloud. I don’t speak, read, or write Chinese very well; I never have. It was only in my mid-teens that I learned the difference between 读 and 看, when I had previously always used 读 (reading aloud) to signify “read.” I suppose my relatives must have thought I spent a lot of time reciting poetry and prose to myself.
It’s an understandable oversight: When we’re taught to read, we begin by reading aloud—logistically, I’m not sure how you could teach a child to read in silence—and our first attempts at transliterating lines and curves into words always begins with oral utterances. But our use of the same word—“read”—to signify both reading aloud and in silence perhaps obfuscates our awareness of the intrinsic difference between two very different activities.
According to some sources, silent reading is a modern invention—in the past, all reading was done aloud, and the passage in St. Augustine’s “Confessions” depicting St. Ambrose reading “with his voice silent and his tongue still” has become the iconic example of the genesis of silent reading. Almost all languages have their literary roots in an oral culture, and the wonders of poetry are often fully actualized only when pronounced trippingly on the tongue. But today, these are exceptions, and for the most part we do our reading soundlessly and privately.
It was not until I spoke to a friend who has a very difficult time reading that I realized what it is that I take for granted. For those unable to see, reading has to intrude upon other senses—either a machine or a human reads aloud to them, or they have to feel their way through braille letters. In both cases, the silence and stillness of reading becomes an impossibility, and the auditory or kinetic intrudes upon a process that we too often forget to appreciate. We are habituated to the tranquility of the reading process—the privacy and the simplicity of reading anything, anywhere, anytime—that we forget how wonderful it is.
It still amazes me that we can transform signs on a page into something that penetrates deep into the caverns of our mind, but I’m not here interested in Saussurean semiotics or the phenomenology of reading—rather simply the act of reading. The closest we get to re-kindling our initial sense of wonderment is by acquiring fluency in a new alphabet system, and all of a sudden, finding that previously unintelligible scripts have become familiar.
Reading is strange. Think about how you’re reading now, as you look over these words. Do you hear a voice reading the words out to you—and is it your voice, or someone else’s voice? Are you skimming over the article picking out only key words, only half-concentrating while the world continues around you? Are you distracted by other thoughts running simultaneously through your mind? How does your mind separate between the words you are reading and the words of your thoughts? And what did you do when you encountered the Chinese characters? How did they register in your mind’s eye? How do we look at words and internalize their meaning, often without consciously trying?
It is dangerous to be self-conscious about reading: two summers ago, I couldn’t read for more than five minutes without trying to catch the machinations of my unconscious, reading mind, which, of course, interrupted my natural way of reading. It’s the classic problem of the observer in quantum mechanics—and I eventually abandoned the attempt, recognizing that my consciousness could not capture the transcendent experience of reading.
But left alone in its pure form, reading is beautiful. It’s the interiorization of another’s mind that allows one’s own mind to expand. It’s the paradoxical escape from ‘real life’ that helps us cope with reality. It’s a suspension of one’s isolation in exchange for an embrace of solitude.
For years, I’ve been transfixed by the beauty of Virgil’s line “tacitae per amica silentia lunae,” which roughly translates to “through the friendly silence of the soundless moon.” I’m not sure why I like it so much—perhaps because of the cadence, the assonance, the syntactical chiasmus, perhaps because W. B. Yeats uses it in the title of his book, but perhaps most of all,because of what it evokes: illuminated by words, a visual image of perfect silence.

Microsoft Flight Simulator began as a simple physics model for the Apple II. The instrument panel gauges are basic shapes; the terrain, a wireframe grid of white. If you crash, a cartoonish message tells you so. There are no trees, buildings, rivers, terminals, windsocks. If you want to see the plane’s outside, tough luck. But advance a few generations, and you’ll see this sketch of world start to fill out. Colors appear, then bodies of water, then day and night. Regions of the country take shape in a chunky three dimensions, different models of aircraft become available, and for the first time—allowing for the limitations in the hardware of the time—you begin to hear the propeller’s roar.
It is difficult to explain, to those who do not enjoy them, the appeal of computer simulations. They are games only in the broadest sense: you cannot win them, and there is no direction given. Some people prefer to call them “software toys.” But a good simulation is more a world unto itself, a perpetuum mobile through which something organic evolves. When done right, a simulation has all the inexorable momentum of reality. Things proceed by themselves and can hardly be predicted, but when they do, they seem entirely correct—as though they could not have happened any other way.
As a kid, I went nowhere without Air Nikko: a garish, radio-controlled, sticker-covered plastic toy with illuminated wingtips, a modest selection of audio effects, and—of course—a face. When I came to the age of caring about the realistic, I graduated to real models, sprawled out around an improvised terminal laid out on my car carpet city. I had a methodical imagination: my friends did not like playing with my planes, because I demanded strict imaginative submission to what I then considered the harmonious laws of aerodynamics and air traffic control. I should have either outgrown this fascination or else started begging for kiddie lessons at flight school, but neither of these things happened—the simulator did.
When my sweaty grade-school hands first pulled apart the packaging of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, the series was in its eighth incarnation, and I was nine years old. By this time it was a full-scale model of the Earth as experienced from tarmac to sky, complete with every known airport and square mile of ground. The major cities and airports of the world are modeled as they really are, with accurate buildings and ground texture. You can fly everything from a glider to a jumbo jet on every continent, in every season, and at every time of day. The weather can be downloaded in real time. Every minute complaint of my nine-year-old nerd’s pedantry had been preemptively done away with. The game was perfect.
Upon first running the game, I expected that the world as represented would be exact, that if I flew over northern New Jersey, navigating by dead reckoning along a series of water towers, I would arrive within view of my house. To my extreme disappointment, it did not work like that: outside of a few major areas, the scenery was automatically generated. A blocky, blurry ranch house, one wall sliced through by a misplaced palm, was there where my childhood house should have been.
What I had expected from Flight Simulator, in my naïve exuberance, was something like what Daneri, the mediocre poet in Jorge Luis Borges’ short story “The Aleph,” discovers in his basement—an Aleph, a point in space which contains all other points. Upon finding the Aleph, Daneri devotes his life to the composition of an epic poem describing everything he sees through it. With the same ambition (and the same mediocrity), I decided, at eleven years old, to complete this inadequate Aleph of my own. I started to make scenery files for the simulator, making trips to local airports with a camera and stumbling through the basics of three-dimensional modeling software. I uploaded my little projects to sites I had discovered, all dedicated to hosting add-ons filling in the mosaic of Flight Simulator’s world. I built, and accumulated from others—file by file, year after year—a world that looked and behaved more and more like the one I saw from passenger windows of planes.
Then my hard-drive crashed. And after years of work, I didn’t have the heart to reassemble the world. Because even without me, it’s still going on. The entire world is grist for the simulation’s mill, and once the airports, the satellite topography and the real-world air traffic have all been modeled, there will remain for the designer the question of individuals, animals, and trees.

It begins with me scraping at the Veritaffle maker, desperate to cure my hangover with a hearty meal. It then proceeds with the (re)discovery that all the laundry machines are taken, a procrastination session at Lamont, and a good 30 minutes of choosing between “Girls,” “Game of Thrones,” and “Mad Men.” My name for this slew of customs? “Harvard Sunday.” Now don’t get me wrong. For the past two years, this day of rituals has proven itself reliable and comfortable. But when the start of junior year rolled around, I decided it was time to spice things up with a new addition: afternoon student yoga in Winthrop’s Junior Common Room.
Bikram, Hatha, Vinyasa. You name it, and chances are I’ve tried it. After all, I did do my first sun salutation all the way back in the seventh grade when my school offered yoga in conjunction with hip-hop dance as an alternative to sports or fifth-period P.E. class. I’m still not sure who decided Missy Elliot and Tibetan meditation chimes would pair well, but my friends and I were willing to do anything to avoid picking up a field hockey stick or softball.
With the seeds for a successful tree pose officially planted, yoga soon became engrained in both my muscles and general lifestyle. Nowadays, I can confidently attest to liking Warrior Two stance more than Warrior One and guarantee that my feet will get cold three minutes into Shavasana, the final corpse position intended to induce deep relaxation. Like many other practitioners, I believe the activity to be a personal journey of self-exploration. I’ve come to learn my body’s physical limits in terms of balance and flexibility while engaging with more psychological elements such as self-awareness, patience, and control.
And yet, up until a month ago, I had always done yoga in a gym or studio. So when I arrived to class a few minutes early this past Sunday to the sound of two seniors improvising and rehearsing on Winthrop’s baby grand pianos, I had the startling realization that my one hour of introspection would begin exactly where my peers’ one hour of musical expression had left off. By sharing a common space, my practice—which had always been one of turning inward for harmony—suddenly became the continuation of another sort of practice, one that moved outward for the very same thing.
The surprise I felt upon having yoga and art juxtaposed forced me to acknowledge just how compartmentalized and stagnant both aspects of my life had become. While I thought that a few back bends and hip-opening stretches would infuse my robotic schedule with new vigor and energy, the truth was I had turned these motions into their own mere routine. Sunday yoga had become equated with just another time slot that didn’t extend past the boundaries of 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. In failing to challenge myself, I no longer experienced the revelations and wonders that awkwardness, discomfort, and novelty so often bring about.  And if I had stunted my own process of self-exploration, could it be that I had also isolated my artistic self-expression to several hours in the Carpenter Center and reduced my creativity to predetermined mechanics?
“Yoga” comes from the Sanskrit word “Yuj,” which means to yoke or to join. Every so often, we forget to synch our minds with our bodies and environments. In the critical moment when the actor begins to recite memorized lines rather than convey emotion, when the painter’s hand loses intention and precision, when the yoga practitioner does her 100th forward lunge like her 100th rather than her first, we shut off the circuit that unifies self-exploration with what is essentially its Siamese twin, self-expression.

I wish every weekend lasted three days. That would really help me in my tireless quest for idleness. I spent the luxuriously long Columbus Day weekend with my grandparents. They are retired, and their quiet Princeton home is a veritable shrine to doing nothing. But it’s a very different flavor of down time from my Harvard-idling. There is no Wifi. There is no alcohol (yes, I went there willingly). There is limited TV-watching. There are, however, lots and lots of back issues of the New Yorker—a lifetime’s worth to be exact, since my grandmother has been a subscriber for almost 60 years. They should give her some kind of medal.
Reading back issues of the New Yorker is arguably as useless as pinning things to boards on Pinterest, and yet I feel less guilty doing the former. Do I feel less guilty about doing nothing at my grandparents’ because I am doing so in a quaint, retro, vaguely ’60s-ish way? Because I bake pecan pie in between naps on the chintz sofa? I don’t know. Maybe it’s because for my grandparents, who worked well into their seventies, this environment of calm is utterly deserved and appropriate. As a visitor to their idle abode, I too am entitled—no obligated—to do nothing. Doing schoolwork would be a disruption. It would be rude.
While I was in Princeton, a friend took me to see Flying Lotus play at Terminal 5 in New York City. While Flying Lotus is by no means obscure among electronic music listeners, he is not a household name, certainly not for my octogenarian grandparents. “What kind of music does he play?” they asked, earnestly. And that’s just the problem. He doesn’t play anything. “He’s sort of electro-hip-hop,” I floundered, their blank expressions indicating how little that phrase meant to them.
The concert was fantastic: visually arresting, weed-infused, and bass-heavy. But throughout Flying Lotus’s artfully crafted beats and samples of songs from the Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic” to Kanye West’s “Mercy,” I couldn’t help feeling like his music is lazy—not just his, but his whole genre. It doesn’t create, it synthesizes and mixes and retools. It is parasitic, only thrilling to listen to in the same way that a favorite film is fun to watch drunk. The sounds, (minimal) lyrics, and hooks are all familiar, but somehow the sensory experience is somewhat enhanced
It happened to be Flying Lotus’s birthday the night of the concert. A tall, muscular, imposing black man, he paraded out onto the stage to a raucous “Happy Birthday” from the audience. The stage was Spartan—just a lone Mac laptop on a platform in the middle, and a screen in back onto which the visual effects were projected. No drum kit gleaming in the low light, no mics, no wires, no nothing. Because “FlyLo” doesn’t need them. FlyLo doesn’t play music, he makes it. Right there, in front of your eyes. He mixes new tracks at every show. His equipment-light setup gives him license to improvise. There are no other musicians to collaborate with. He is his own master of music mixology.
Onstage, FlyLo is certainly not lazy. He’s furiously switching between laptops, sometimes swaying to the beat, sometimes standing perfectly still, statuesque, unmoved by the pounding base. He is like an electro profit behind his Mac pulpit bestowing his beat bounty on the masses. But the line between glorified disc jockey and original artist is a fine one. On the rare occasions that FlyLo stepped away from the Mac to waltz around the stage, leaving the music to play, I was instantly reminded how little he actually does to make the music happen.
At these points it felt like FlyLo was just throwing himself a rather large birthday party, and being very aggressive about his playlist. Whatever. At least it was a killer playlist.

Of the 19 plays being produced through the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club this semester, eight are the work of playwrights who are also current Harvard students—many more, campus playwrights say, than there were a few years ago. The Crimson sat down to discuss the challenges and opportunities of student-written theater with four campus playwrights whose productions premiered recently: Crimson Arts editor Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, whose “Wordplays” ran this past weekend; Andy J. Boyd ’14; Crimson Arts executive Hayley C. Cuccinello ’14; and Cassandra L. Rasmussen ’13. Their plays “Stingers,” “Jenna’s Birthday,” and “Star Ash” were all staged earlier this month.
The Harvard Crimson: You are all younger than most playwrights out there—do you think it’s challenging to write a play and write different characters realistically since you have less life experience?
Andy J. Boyd:  I feel like you can trick people into believing you have more life experience than you do if you read books—it’s not that hard.
Cassandra L. Rasmussen: In certain ways, being young could be seen as a disadvantage because we haven’t had as many life experiences, but at the same time I feel we’re open to hearing other people’s stories. You can’t really experience everything; you have to listen. And it’s also a situation, too, where you’re having an actor portray [a] role, so they’re adding their experience to your experience, and the two of you can come up with something.
THC: Has your time at Harvard affected your writing or your writing aspirations?
CLR: Every year I would write one-acts for the playwriting festivals in my high school, so I hoped that when I came to college I’d be able to continue that, but I was a little overwhelmed by all the talented people around me. So my self-confidence kind of dropped freshman year, and I was forced to really revisit my playwriting and think about it differently.
Hayley C. Cuccinello: I think I finished my first play when I was 16; however, like Cassie I sort of had to take a break when I got to Harvard…. Around my sophomore year, I was like, “I really need to get back to what I love,” and part of that was inspired by my friend Andy Boyd, and seeing him produce show after show after show, and seeing how much he learned from it. I realized I needed to stop writing plays in the closet. I needed to actually have people perform them.
THC: What is the biggest obstacle to be overcome in a completely student-created production?
HCC: I’ve heard from some actors in the community that, if they’re choosing between a student-written show and something that’s more recognizable, the default choice will often be to pick the more recognizable show. And that’s understandable… It’s also sort of a shame, because you [as a director] could put on the world premiere [of a student-written show].
AJB: If I were a director, I would think that’s so cool.
Nathan O. Hilgartner: But it depends on what play.
AJB: I think people are scared, scared of putting on something that might not be good, and they don’t realize that there have been bad productions of “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” or “The Zoo Story” or any great play you can name.
NOH: But there’s one less factor to worry about with something like that, whereas with a new play, that’s almost everything. [You have] all the other normal stuff that is so difficult logistically in putting on a play [where] you don’t have to worry about the script, but suddenly there’s the question of “Do these words even work?”
CLR: But what makes it terrifying is also what makes it so exciting. Every actor really gets to mold this character for the first time. To some extent, for an audience seeing a newly written play, it’s difficult to distinguish how the production is different from the script itself, and that’s both a good thing and a bad thing.

A classical concert featuring 17 string players, an up-and-coming electronic jazz musician, a choreographer, and an Icelandic singer deified by the indie scene—“Bach to Björk” was another typically unorthodox performance for Boston String Players and conductor and artistic director Motoki Tanaka. Under Tanaka, the group has been known for adding a contemporary twist to the deeply entrenched traditions of classical music. Despite mild weaknesses in the string players’ performances as well as the collaborating artists’ contributions, the “Bach to Björk” concert held Friday at the Museum of Fine Arts succeeded in that it united a diverse range of pieces from 1721 to 1997 and pushed to fuse them with other, unexpected media.
The adept performance of the string players occasionally felt under-rehearsed, but at its strongest moments it thrilled with the musicians’ emotional range. Several solos in the concert opener, Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Brandenburg Concerto No. 3,” seemed to lack confidence, but the young musicians made up for those shortfalls with a stunning performance of the third piece, Béla Bartók’s “Divertimento for String Orchestra.”
The first two movements of the divertimento were cleanly executed and featured Boston String Players’ ability to blend the timbres of their instruments to create a deep, resonant tone. The third movement, however, was the emotive climax of the entire concert. From the quick call and responses of the rondo to the brilliantly rhapsodic solos of concertmaster Lilit Hartunian, the piece came to life as the performers went beyond what was on the page as they alternated between passages of gentle lilting and fiery intensity.
The ensemble’s integration of different media, though often engaging, did at one point hamper the overall effectiveness of a piece: one of the more disappointing performances on the program was of Benjamin Britten’s “Simple Symphony,” which suffered from its coupling with opaque choreography by dancer Andrea Higgins. The program notes reveal that the choreography was modeled after the role and gestures of an orchestral conductor, but onstage, the dance was unconvincing and difficult to interpret.
Sometimes, Higgins’ movements would be completely counter to those of Tanaka conducting behind her, such as in the Britten’s lyrical and beautiful third movement, during which the quick, abrupt swings of Higgins’ limbs seemed to have come from a caricature of orchestra conducting rather than inspired by the music itself. Ultimately, neither did Higgins’ choreography further the piece’s emotional effect, nor did it provide a coherent—let alone compelling—new interpretation.
But the concert’s greatest strength was the performers’ other, more successful attempts to create a coherent synergy among different media, as in the ensemble’s final piece, an arrangement of Björk’s “Unravel” by Boston-based electronic and jazz musician Chadley. For this performance, the premiere of the arrangement, Chadley himself appeared on stage to play the electronics, and a video by musician and performing visual artist Christopher Saunders was displayed behind the performers.
Chadley’s arrangement of “Unravel” opened with a single note—a high G on the synthesizer—and eventually developed into an astonishingly complex acoustic-electric mélange in 17 string parts. The arrangement brought a new life to the 15-year-old track, maintaining the same beautiful intricacy of sound while exploring a completely different instrumentation, and the string players’ performance did justice to the arranger’s innovative work. Despite how difficult it is to create a cohesive sound using both acoustic and electronic instruments, especially in a live setting, the string players created a balanced sound through careful knowledge of their role in the instrumentation. And here, the integration of non-musical media helped the piece—Saunders’ video accompaniment, which featured abstract geometric shapes that grew and faded in response to the music, created an enrapturing atmosphere fitting to the work’s contemplative tone.
As the last piece closed, what remained was a sense that the concert hardly dragged under the weight of its titanic concept—a fusion of 300 years’ and four countries’ music alongside multiple supplementary media—and remained cohesive in its execution. Boston String Players put together a concert that not only incorporated the time-tested traditions of classical music but also stretched the boundaries of musical performance—two ideas that rarely go together, but in the hands of Tanaka and his musicians formed an inseparable connection.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A boy and a girl walk hand-in-hand on a boardwalk, a man tattooed from head-to-toe leers into the camera, and destitute children eat in front of a stained glass portrait of Jesus. As I enter the hall of Panopticon Gallery, I am surrounded with photographs by Harold Feinstein, who is known for his collection of Coney Island photos that span six decades. Around the corner is a collection of works by Stephen Sheffield, whose haunting black-and-white self-portraits, including one in which he holds his hand up in front of the camera, obscuring his face, portray the photographer as an enigma. In another nook, there are a number of works by Alipio Hernandez, an up-and-coming young artist whose mixed-media creations contain pieces of photographs cut into small fragments that are physically stitched together.
Faced with so many images lining the walls, I was unsure just where to go first. Fortunately for me, the man behind the front desk recognized the look of uncertainty on my face. Panopticon benefits from its location in the Hotel Commonwealth in Kenmore Square. “It’s forced traffic. It’s also opening up people to the arts who might not have been really interested or may not have even gone into a gallery,” says the gallery’s owner and director Jason Landry. “Sometimes galleries are intimidating. Sometimes you go in there [and] people don’t talk to you. People don’t say hi. They don’t even look at you.” Landry presents a striking contrast to the stereotypical image of the snobbish gallery owner—he believes in the value of connecting with each customer who passes through his gallery.
But the role of Landry and fellow gallery owners consists of more than welcoming the public into the art world. Gallery owners seek to represent each artist in the best light possible, not only to make a sale but to help them succeed even after their collection leaves the gallery itself. Although running a gallery out of Boston presents its own set of challenges due to competition with the New York art gallery scene, Landry and his colleagues persevere out of their admiration for art and the artists themselves.
HAVANA HIDEAWAY
A gallery owner is more than just a smiling face who welcomes wanderers through his or her door. The operation and maintenance of an art gallery requires an eye for recruiting talented artists whose work will be featured in the space and organizing the gallery in an attractive layout. Yet gallery owners must also possess the media savvy to manage public relations and the business acumen to manage finances.
The reality of how busy running a gallery can be is clear in the situation of Michelle Wojcik, director of the Galeria Cubana in South Boston. The Galeria Cubana is named as such since it specializes in displaying and selling works by Cuban artists. The U.S.-imposed trade embargo forbids Cuban artists from directly shipping their work to the United States. Fortunately, the gallery has one of few permits from the U.S. Treasury Department, allowing Wojcik to travel to Cuba and carry artwork. But this means Wojcik is required to leave the country on a fairly regular basis. “I have been hand-carrying all the artwork in and out of Havana on a plane,” she says. Paper pieces are stored in portfolios, canvas pieces get rolled into tubes, tubes get packed into boxes, and it all gets brought to the states by Wojcik herself.
Gallery owners are responsible for the artistic integrity and organizational strength of their gallery, both of which are challenging in their own right. In some cases, gallery owners are fortunate enough to be able to divide their responsibilities with a gallery president, a gallery director, or others. In the case of Panopticon Gallery, the work of running the gallery rests on the shoulders of just one proprietor, with intermittent help from the occasional intern. “You have to understand that running a gallery is not a 9 to 5.... I’m always working,” Landry says. “And I like that.”
CRAFTING THE ARTIST
Despite the time Landry must invest in running Panopticon, he finds his work highly rewarding. “Being able to give emerging artists their first exhibition is very fulfilling,” Landry says. He enjoys working with all types of artists, whether they be notable artists like Harold Feinstein or newcomers like Alipio Hernandez. Yet there is something particularly satisfying for Landry about the first showing of a new artist’s work. “Seeing the expressions that they have, seeing them bring their friends and family—that gives me a lot of joy,” he says.
Wojcik also enjoys garnering exposure for her artists, but the particular mission of her gallery to promote Cuban artwork adds a certain level of significance to her efforts. “I think it’s very unusual for people in this part of the United States in particular to see anything coming out of Cuba,” Wojcik says. “I really enjoy contributing to the art scene in that way. And I love engaging with the artists in Cuba and being able to support them.… To see the base of collectors being built over time is really exciting.” Wojcik finds assisting her artists in gaining traction outside of their native country particularly fulfilling.
Some gallery owners view presenting the work of emerging artists as an opportunity not only to promote their art but also to give them insight into their own work. Owner of Khaki gallery in South Boston, Nahid Khaki, who also has worked as an artist for three decades, appreciates how her role and years of experience allow her to help artists view their work in a different context. “I will tell them how to go about making their work better or how to go about showing it or displaying it,” Khaki says. “You have to be careful how to guide them or direct them, because you don’t want to make them feel that you’re saying something critical.” Khaki’s experience as a gallery owner and as an artist gives her particular insight into how to interact with artists, but other gallery owners agree that selling artwork is merely one part of the process.  Gallery owners have the potential to guide artists and introduce their work to the art world.
HAWKING CUBANA
Not all gallery directors worked as artists for years like Khaki or even possess a professional background in art. Many years before he even thought of owning a gallery, Landry left art school where he was studying photography in order to work in business. After about 10 years at a Fortune 500 company, Landry decided to come to Boston to study at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. It was during that time  that he began considering running a gallery. “I was trying to figure out a way where I could marry my business background and my photography background into one thing that I could succeed at as well as help other people,” Landry says. After completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts   and Masters of Fine Arts, he started working at Boston University’s Photographic Resource Center, where a colleague put him in contact with then-owner of Panopticon Gallery, Tony Decaneas. He was looking for a buyer for his gallery, and Landry was looking for a gallery to buy. Both walked away with what they wanted, and Landry has been running Panopticon Gallery since 2010.
Wojcik’s career trajectory is even more unexpected. Wojcik, who is not trained as an artist, owes her current position at the Galeria Cubana to her academic interest in post-Soviet studies. When she spent the summer of 2002 in Cuba doing research for her dissertation and for a policy organization, she took an interest in artists’ studios. “Art being…one of the few professions that [Cubans] could do privately…I basically could step into a home or studio and really get a glimpse into Cuban life,” Wojcik says. “Then I started to realize how very wonderfully expressive and sometimes emotional the work is.” Art studios and artisan markets provided Wojcik with a window into aspects of Cuban culture, but she ended up becoming fascinated with the artwork itself. A changing political climate prompted her to leave Cuba in 2004, but her devotion to Cuban art and culture stayed with her. Three years later, Wojcik’s passion culminated in the opening of Galeria Cubana in Provincetown, MA, followed by the opening of the gallery’s Boston location in 2009. Though Landry, Wojcik, and Khaki’s paths have little in common, a profound passion for art and the artists’ success unites them.
PAINT DOWN THE DRAIN
Given its passionate gallery directors, high-profile art schools, and strong intellectual culture, Boston seems to possess the ideal conditions in which a city could develop a bustling artistic community. However, it is in reality challenging at times to succeed as a gallery owner or artist in this city. Many of the issues that gallery directors in Boston face are symptoms of the city’s proximity to the artistic mecca of New York City. “A lot of people say, ‘I’d rather buy a piece of art from an art dealer in New York than buy one in Boston,’” Landry says. New York art galleries tend to distract prospective buyers of art in Boston from discovering artistic treasures that are a few T stops away.
According to Khaki, the allure of the New York gallery scene tends to make it more difficult for Boston art gallery owners to hold onto their artists over time. “There [are] a lot of good artists. They come here, they go to the best schools here in this town, and once they get a show, when they see it’s not selling, when they see there’s not a good review or there’s not any review in The Boston Globe or other papers in town, then they move on,” Khaki says. She is sympathetic to these artists’ concerns but as a local gallery director, this artistic brain drain poses a problem. “As an artist, I totally understand where they come from. As a gallery owner, it’s not so good for me,” Khaki says.
The lack of reviews and sales is obviously a source of frustration for artists, but many are also concerned about having their message heard by a larger audience. This challenge was one factor in artist Ian Colon’s departure from Boston. Colon, a native of Florida, came to Boston to complete a BFA. Through networking with faculty and fellow students at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Colon got the opportunity to help organize and curate exhibits at a small alternative gallery space located on 57 Delle Avenue. The space was christened FiveSevenDelle, and it became a venue where avant-garde pieces and performers could find an audience. Colon enjoyed the work and Boston’s vibrant performing arts community, but over time he was not satisfied with his level of exposure. “I was putting on events and going to events where the faces of the crowd were very similar everywhere I went,” Colon says. He found the tight-knit aspect of Boston’s artistic community worked against his aspiration to challenge audiences on their perceptions of art. “There was a great community, but challenge wasn’t there because the people were going to support you no matter what,” Colon says.
Khaki agrees that the size of the Boston art community can present a challenge, but this same characteristic also yields benefits. “The only negative thing is that there’s not enough collectors. But in terms of the wonderful art schools, the community of artists—and it’s not as crazy as New York. It’s a wonderful, spacious urban city.... I really appreciate being in Boston,” Khaki says. Gallery owners in Boston must work harder to attract buyers and retain artists than their New York counterparts, but those who choose to work in Boston still appreciate its merits.
SOHO SPIN
Though the Boston art community has strengths of its own, a group of galleries, shops, and studio lofts in South Boston has taken a cue from New York’s SoHo in order to promote themselves. These businesses (including the Khaki Gallery and the Galeria Cubana) have branded themselves as SoWa, referring to the area’s location on Harrison Avenue, South of Washington Street. The SoWa Artists’ Guild works to promote its constituents and their enterprises through outreach programs and publicity events. These include First Fridays and SoWa Sundays, which attempt to draw in additional visitors to the arts district by letting visitors tour artistic spaces and meet with the people who work and display in them. The SoWa Artists Guild website promises that these events will appeal even to “first time art buyers [and] those who have never considered art before.”
Joanna Fink, director of the Alpha Gallery and the current president of the Boston Art Dealers’ Association, is very familiar with the challenges Bostonian art galleries must confront. An art historian by training, Fink comes from a family of artists and art lovers and her Newbury Street gallery is a family business originally opened by her father in 1967. In her capacity as the head of the BADA, Fink oversees many of the community activities of Bostonian galleries. She acknowledges that existing galleries in Boston are struggling and that the artistic community is fairly clustered, but she sees advantages to that insularity. “It is not as if every gallery is presenting the same thing. Therefore, by clustering together, it offers the public the opportunity to visit several galleries in one area and see each gallery in the context of the others,” Fink wrote in an email.
The Boston Art Dealers Association employs varied community outreach strategies to keep the public engaged and invested in art happenings in the city. These include gallery talks in which interested people can visit a gallery and engage in a discourse with artists and gallery proprietors, panel discussions featuring guests from community artists, and a scholarship that is awarded to young, local artists with promise.
Fink not only believes that galleries can cooperate to foster one another but also that galleries have the power to enrich the Boston community. “When someone purchases a work of art, they are setting in motion a chain of events. They are making a statement about where they stand aesthetically, they are choosing to support the artist whose work they admire, and they are supporting the gallery that recognized the merits of that artist’s work,” Fink wrote. “Galleries can keep their doors open (to all visitors, not just buyers) and artists can continue to make their art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For years conservative Republicans have pointed in apocalyptic tones to Europe as the freedom-suffocating socialist paradise of high government spending, taxation, and regulation that Democrats would transform the United States into if they ever got the chance. With the rise of the Tea Party, this became the GOP’s favorite form of ammunition against President Barack Obama.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney makes the argument repeatedly on the campaign trail. Romney warns that Obama “wants to turn America into a European-style social welfare state.” In the primaries Romney, displaying his characteristic knack for pandering, insisted, “Guess what. Europe isn't working in Europe. It’s not going to work here. I believe in America.”
Romney gives the impression that Europe is one big glob of a failed state. It’s easy for Americans to forget sometimes, but Europe is in fact 27 different nations, each with its own unique culture, government, and social system. Simply criticizing “Europe” suggests someone more interested in scoring cheap political points than seriously evaluating other countries’ policies.
Furthermore, it isn’t at all apparent that Europe isn’t working in Europe. Maybe Romney thinks the current debt crisis is proof that large welfare states are unsustainable, leading to spiraling deficits and high unemployment.
Greek profligacy certainly contributed to the current crisis. And, like us, Europeans are wrestling with how to reconcile commitments to the elderly and vulnerable with an aging population.
But other embattled countries like Spain and Ireland were actually running surpluses prior to the bursting of the real estate bubble. In Germany, where social spending is actually higher as a percentage of GDP than in Greece, unemployment is at 5.5% while deficit spending in 2011 was 1% of GDP. The economy of Sweden, another extensive welfare state, grew twice as fast as ours did in 2011.
It is more accurate to say that part of Europe isn’t working. Other parts of Europe are working better than America is, in certain respects. The 30-second ad frenzy we call our campaign season isn’t known for subtleties like these, of course. What is disturbing, however, is that is that the GOP mainstream seems to have actually adopted the philosophy that borrowing ideas from other counties, even highly successful countries with happy citizens, is wrong.
Many Republicans think Europeans (and Democrats) want to have their cake and eat it too because, the argument goes, robust economies are incompatible with generous states. Ignoring countries that have successfully combined the two, like Denmark and Germany, allows the GOP to maintain the illusion that their policies are the only policies that have ever worked in history. All Americans need to do, they argue, is put aside their emotions and do the logical thing.
But reality is a little less black and white. Low-tax, low-spending governments are sustainable, but so are high-tax, high-spending governments, within limits. What point America chooses on the spectrum in between is a function not just of logic but of values, principles, and emotions. It’s messy. To make these difficult choices informed ones, Americans should at least be able to depend on their leaders to present accurate characterizations of countries that have struck balances different than our own.
Echoing Romney, Reince Priebus, Chairman of the National Republican Party, recently complained that Obama is “looking to Europe for guidance” for his policies. Maybe I’m naïve, but given the magnitude of the problems we face right now, shouldn’t we be casting as wide a net as possible for solutions? I don’t just want Obama looking to Europe for guidance, I want him looking to every country on Earth for ideas on how to do things better.
The idea that we should deliberately fail to learn from other countries is a recipe for national decline. South Korean teenagers vastly outscore American teenagers on math, reading, and science tests.  Japan spends 9% of GDP on healthcare to our 17%, without sacrificing quality. Canadians are more socially mobile than Americans. These are causes for hope, not despair. We’re being shown the way forward. If we want this to be another American century, we need to learn from these examples, not pretend they don’t exist because they clash with our preferred worldview.
Republicans insist that America needs “American solutions.” But what exactly does that mean? Surely not doing things more expensively or poorly than we need to because a political party refuses to admit a mistake (something Democrats are also guilty of).
This country was not built by people too proud to learn from others. Samuel Slater, the Father of the American Industrial Revolution, began America’s first factory in 1790 after memorizing the design of Britain’s textile machines. Germany’s autobahn inspired President Dwight Eisenhower to propose the Interstate Highway System. In the words of Steve Jobs talking about Apple, “We have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.”
Let’s swallow our pride and start stealing the best ideas out there, whether they come from home or abroad. Americans need solutions, not talking points.

One of the most rapidly changing spheres of American society is the realm of education. Over the last generation, higher education has increasingly become a prerequisite to social mobility. The challenges of accommodating such an increase in appetite for learning have been profound. In the pursuit of expanding education beyond its gates, Harvard recently partnered with MIT to launch edX, a series of Massive Online Open Courses. Continually expanding and wildly popular, edX is built to become a comprehensive alternative to traditional education. So far the project bodes well. Harvard’s contribution to the project should be commended, and the overall trend toward affordable education continued.
A non-profit venture, edX was created to further a mission of accessible education started by MITx in 2011. With $60 million in startup capital provided by Harvard and MIT, edX constitutes one of the largest investments made in online education. Evidence suggests it will need the money. Online, accessible education has so far proved a lethal industry for some of its entrants: Columbia attempted its own program that failed in 2003, and a similar effort by Yale, Oxford, and Stanford closed six years ago due to insufficient funds. We can only hope that edX does not suffer a similar fate, as the status quo is in desperate need of change.
It is a foregone conclusion that many traditional avenues of higher education have become prohibitively expensive. Coupled with an increase in the proportion of employers requiring degrees, this dynamic has only made the need for alternative resources all the more pressing. Due to increasing costs and high demand, schools have become more expensive than ever. In the vacuum left by a lack of accessible, low-cost education, for-profit colleges have exploited the American public, promising affordable degrees that more often than not leave students mired in more debt.
An estimated 60 percent of the 20 million students in the United States borrow to finance an education. Among those who borrow, median debt is $20,000. State Colleges, traditionally a cost-effective means of receiving an education, still leave students with a median debt of $17,700.  At private universities, this figure is $22,380, and at for-profit institutions, $32,650.
Harvard and its partner schools are truly breaking the mold in offering no-cost access to high-quality course material and resources to collaborate with others interested in scholarship. With the only prerequisites being an internet connection and a desire to learn, edX is one of the first genuinely open platforms for learning, one that does not discriminate by socioeconomic status. Equally important, the program provides participants with free certificates upon completion, a crucial way of signaling marketable skills to employers.
According to the edX website, more than 140 schools have expressed interest in joining the program, and there are plans to include as many courses as possible in the coming months and years. Since the inception of public education, universal access to information and scholarship has remained an elusive goal. The expansion of quality educational resources that is edX could perhaps prove to be a very large step toward the fulfillment of this mission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For one young girl, an iPod provided her with the opportunity to smile for the first time in months. Her life-threatening illness had robbed her body of the ability to communicate, but she could still find beauty and happiness through music. For another boy, fighting for his life meant leaving his family in Russia to seek treatment in the United States. With a netbook, he was able to see his father’s face for the first time in over one year via Skype. Such is the work of Mikey’s Way, a charity founded by the late Michael “Mikey” J. Friedman ’11 to provide electronic toys to children with cancer and other life threatening conditions. “The kids literally have nothing,” says Les Friedman, Mikey’s father and the current chief executive officer of Mikey’s Way. “The first casualty of cancer is the pocketbook. Most people cannot afford anything beyond the treatment.” Les knows the mental, physical, and financial challenges from his family’s own experience. When Mikey was diagnosed with cancer soon after his 15th birthday, his family “entered a whole other world.”
To combat his extremely rare and aggressive cancer, Mikey entered treatment that his doctors and nurses described as “the edge of death and back.” The chemotherapy was so toxic that he only survived thanks to stem cells extracted from his own bone marrow months earlier. “I’ll only say I was released twenty years later. Or was it one month? I cannot tell,” Mikey wrote after the experience, “but I did not know that the worst was yet to come.” Amidst the chemotherapy, radiation, and a failed liver, in what he called “the darkest depths of human circumstance,” Mikey decided to do more than just live. “People react differently when faced with the worst tragedies,” explained his father, “Mikey carried his entire family through the ordeal.” According to Mackenzie J. Lowry ’11, who befriended Mikey during pre-frosh weekend, he “deliberately lived life with a lot of kindness.” “He was optimistic, always optimistic,” said his roommate Mark A. Isaacson ’11.
Cancer has the power to rip apart lives and dreams; Mikey had the power to transform it into something else. While in remission, the Make-A-Wish Foundation offered him one wish. His family discussed vacations or buying something that he wanted, but Mikey wished for something grander. He gave his wish away, and used the money that Make-A-Wish would have spent on him to found Mikey’s Way. “I used to think that the question was ‘what would you do with one wish?’” explained his father, “but the real question is ‘what would you do if you knew you were going to die?’ Mikey knew that he was going to found this charity the day he relapsed.” What he did in the face of the relapse, said Lowry, “speaks so much to who he is. People think you aren’t going to make it soon. You can do one more big thing in your life, and he wanted to alleviate hospital boredom in others. The struggle, pain, and isolation that he felt was very real.” According to all who knew him, Mikey was brilliant and determined enough to cure cancer, but life was not going to provide him with the time. Having lived through not only the intense pain of his treatment but also the extreme boredom of daytime television and weeks in the hospital, he decided to alleviate the suffering of others. He found a purpose, and he lived it wholeheartedly.
Harvard gave Mikey the opportunity, in the words of his father, to “just be another kid.” He didn’t mention his struggle or his charity, and his blockmates and friends fell in love with his humor and optimism. Unlike his fellow students, he never complained about problem sets or exams, but instead “lived out his life’s purpose every single day” according to Lowry. One day four years ago this month, Mikey didn’t come home to his room in Kirkland. After four years of battling cancer, he lost. His purpose didn’t. His family decided to continue the mission of his charity, and they’ve helped over 2,500 children in 21 different hospitals use electronics to escape their illness and ease their suffering, but each trip is expensive. There are many worthy charities and missions to support, but few so close to this campus community.
At Harvard, institutional memory is so short. The undergraduates who knew Mikey have graduated and moved on, but not long ago an extraordinarily caring young man called this place home. He was too humble to advertise his charity, but to know of him is to be inspired. The question that Mikey faced, “what would you do if you knew you were going to die?” applies to all of us. His charity wasn’t his wish. It was his life.

Doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center recently took a stand. The hospital will no longer purchase Zaltrap, a superfluous drug that, they contend, is harder to administer and delivers no better treatment than the existing alternative—despite being twice as expensive.
But Sloan-Kettering is just a single hospital making a principled stand. Medicare is still obligated by law to cover every drug that the Federal Drug Administration approves at the exorbitant prices dictated by manufacturers. Contrary to common sense, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies over the drugs it purchases under Part D of the Medicare Modernization Act, signed by President Bush in 2003.
There ought to be bipartisan outcry at the perverse practice of putting profits before patients. Republicans especially ought to decry provisions like Part D and excessive patent protections that distort the cherished free market. Unfortunately, our current government acts as a wholly owned subsidiary of corporations more often than a ruling body concerned for its constituents.
Neither the Republicans nor Democrats would dare to push back against a health services industry that will spend $187 million in campaign contributions in 2012 alone. Instead, health legislation is often crafted with extensive interference from insurance and pharmaceutical special interest groups. Congress slashes funding and weakens the mandate of the agencies charged with securing Americans from the possible excesses of corporations.
The FDA is underfunded, understaffed, and starved of power and only nominally regulates the lucrative drug market as a result. Drugs can be rubber-stamped by the FDA even if test results are faked, advances are minimal, or costs are excessive. Antithetical to the spirit of medical progress, the strict patent protections for prescription drugs enforced by the FDA encourage drug inventors to stall innovation in hope of prolonged, hefty profits.
Current patents protect drugs for 20 years after they are invented. Once patent protections expire, generic manufacturers can produce the drugs. That is, unless name-brand pharmaceutical companies pay generic manufacturers not to produce any drugs in order to continue to pass off ridiculously high prices to consumers. These companies shamelessly exploit a legal loophole mandating the FDA to freeze approval for 30 months when a generic drug is challenged in court in order to delay much cheaper generics. A provision intentioned to protect the health of patients is perverted simply to increase revenues, patients’ welfare be damned.
Companies also skirt patent expirations by producing drugs with very slight chemical modifications that add very little to actual patient health in order to preserve the enormous profits associated with patent protection. The FDA does little to stop this dubious practice.
In fact, the FDA is one of the worst examples of a “revolving door” in which personnel freely move between regulatory and industry positions. Executives who move through the revolving door promote poor regulation in the hope of capturing a high-salaried industry job. As a result of such a flimsy separation, the FDA has been captured by the very industry it was designed to regulate.
Such a revolving door leads to examples like Michael R. Taylor, current Deputy Commissioner for Foods at the FDA and former vice president for public policy at Monsanto, a multinational biotechnology corporation known for its promotion of genetically modified foods. Under food safety czar Taylor, the FDA has maintained its policy of exempting GMOs, as foods “generally recognized as safe,” from premarket approval. This comes despite growing scientific evidence linking GMO consumption with cancer and other illnesses.
But now Taylor is trusted to ensure the safety of the nation’s food.
FDA inefficacy is but a particular instance of an endemic culture of corruption that has infected nearly every governmental agency inside the Beltway. The only way to protect American citizens from unreliable and unsafe foods and drugs is to legislate sweeping reforms of the system that reclaim the FDA for the people from industry.
But the money that promotes terrible regulation at the FDA is the very same money that is funneled torrentially into the coffers of congressional candidates on both sides of the aisle. Real reform can’t happen until the system making our representatives beholden to drug companies for reelection campaigns is drastically changed. Otherwise, the industries expected to deliver health and sustenance might be doing just the opposite.

Harvard’s investment strategy is aimed at providing funds for the University’s teaching and research initiatives, rather than promoting a particular social cause through investing, University President Drew G. Faust tried to impress upon students during an open forum hosted by the Undergraduate Council and Harvard Graduate Council Monday evening.
“Its primary purpose and its fundamental commitment is to generating the revenue from the endowment that enables us to do everything that we do,” Faust said of the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s investments. “That is its sustaining goal and it devotes itself to that, not to using the investments to advance particular agendas of one sort or another.”
Faust addressed the University’s investment strategies in response to question about whether she thought Harvard should be more transparent regarding the way it manages its endowment.
Faust compared investments to a chess game, where success is dependent upon not revealing strategy.
“Transparency and investment success are not correlated,” Faust said.
Over the past year, students at Harvard have called for Harvard to consider socially responsible investment, which encourages the incorporation of environmental, social, and governance concerns into evaluations of potential investments.
Harvard has said that it already considers SRI factors when making investment choices—a sentiment echoed by Faust Monday evening.
Samuel F. Wohns ’14, who asked Faust why Harvard has policies in place prohibiting investment in tobacco but not in other areas like child labor, said he was not satisfied with Faust’s response, and believes the University should be transparent about its investments.
“The idea that transparency in investment processes is negatively correlated with profit is unfounded and untrue,” said Wohns, who also noted that many organizations choose to follow the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment to guide their own investing.
Wohns, who is a Crimson magazine editor, is one of the founders of Responsible Investment at Harvard, a group that advocates for SRI and transparency.
Faust said that HMC looks for investments that it believes will be sustainable over the long term, which necessarily includes evaluating factors such as labor policy.
She added that “only in the most extreme of circumstances” has Harvard decided to divest for ethical reasons.
HMC currently does not invest in certain industries, including cigarette companies and the businesses that provide packaging and filters for tobacco products. Harvard has also promised to steer clear of PetroChina since HMC decided to divest in 2005 because of the company’s connections to the Sudanese government.
In addition to investment strategy, Faust addressed other student concerns including library reorganization, compensation for Harvard employees, and the concept of “One University.”
The UC solicited questions for the event using a Google Doc that was sent over House lists in the days preceding the event.
As a follow up to Monday’s forum, the UC will host a panel on College governance with Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds next week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School students Elizabeth M. Paci and Alexander White stood at the center of the Harvard Kennedy School courtyard early Monday morning armed with 8 wooden rods and forty binders.
“We don’t have permission to do this,” White said with a grin, hammering a wooden rod into the ground and stacking three binders around it.
Paci and White, who worked with fellow Kennedy School students Blake Hyatt and Helena V. Pylvainen, said they put up an “artistic” binder display just outside their school’s main entrance to call for a diversification of Kennedy School faculty.
The students wrote phrases such as “at least Romney had binders” and “take responsibility for faculty diversity” on the binders. They also wrote the the words “queer,” “Latino,” and “black” to identify other underrepresented populations in the faculty.
“There’s a spectrum of different kinds of protests, many of which have a lot of big demands,” Paci said. “But this is a lot more spontaneous and free-spirited, and we meant for it to get people to talk about the issue.”
The idea for the binder protest played on a moment from last week’s second presidential debate, when Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney used the phrase “binders full of women” in describing his record of hiring women as a Massachusetts governor.
The infamous phrase has since spread to blogs, anti-Romney campaigns, and now, to HKS. Paci said that once they heard it, they knew they had to use it.
White added that while it was “funny that Mitt Romney is being criticized for this, the HKS record is even worse.”
“We should laugh about it, but at the same time we should recognize that this is happening in our own backyard,” he said.
Ideas to use Romney’s slip-up for what Paci said was a more “productive cause” surfaced at a diversity mixer hosted last week by the Kennedy School Diversity Committee, a faculty-student group. There, the four students began planning what they called the “binder protest”. All of them are also involved with the Progressive Caucus at the Kennedy School.
According to the 2011 Annual Report released by the Office of the Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity, only 27% of Kennedy School junior faculty members, and 19% of senior faculty members, were women. In addition, the report revealed that Latino professors made up only 4% of Kennedy School junior faculty members and 3% of senior faculty members. At the time, there were no black professors at the Kennedy School.
“That’s pretty horrible,” Paci said. “If the Kennedy school is a pipeline to government or a world leadership position, we need to have women in that pipeline.”
In response to the protest, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 wrote in an email to The Crimson that they’ve doubled the number of tenured women faculty during his deanship.
“We support our students advocating on behalf of causes that are important to the HKS community–particularly on issues as essential as diversity,” he wrote.
“While we have made progress in recent years, there is much more work to be done, and we look forward to working with our students and other members of the Kennedy School community on this important issue,” he wrote.
The students who organized this “binder protest” said that they acknowledged the display’s limited impact.
“This isn’t a silver bullet,” White said. “I don’t expect the dean to wake up and say, ‘Oh, we need more females! That’s the ticket!’ But it achieved the goal that we wanted it to achieve, which was to restart the discussion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a public seminar at the Harvard School of Public Health on Monday afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust said that she has come to embrace her role as Harvard’s first female president in the years after her appointment in 2007.
“It’s really important that I inhabit this role,” she said. “[My appointment] has an important symbolic force within American life, American higher education, and even around the world.”
Faust said that when she was first named University president, she wanted to avoid being put into a “special box” because she is a woman.
“I’m not the woman president of Harvard. I’m the president of Harvard,” Faust famously said during a press conference in 2007 regarding her appointment.
At the time, Faust said during the discussion at HSPH, she wanted to avoid whatever “debility or identity” accompanied focusing on her gender immediately after she assumed her position.
“I just thought it was so important to say, I’m going to be the president of Harvard, and kind of, get used to it,” she said.
Numerous people have since then contacted Faust to tell her that she has served as a role model for their daughters. Their outreach, Faust said, made her realize the importance of being Harvard’s first female president.
Faust said that she makes a point of visiting all-girls’ schools whenever she travels internationally in order to speak with young women about their aspirations and the future of higher education.
Faust is one of several women at the helms of Ivy League institutions. Amy Gutman ’71 and Shirley M. Tilghman are the current presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University, respectively. Economist Christina H. Paxson succeeded Ruth J. Simmons as president of Brown University this past March.
Faust said she thinks the nature of higher education leadership positions uniquely allows for women to succeed in such roles.
“Presidencies come pretty late in career. University presidents don’t tend to be very young because they have to do so many things first,” she said. “And I think that is a relief in the sense that I don’t feel that I’m short-changing my child. She’s already grown.”
Faust said women currently hoping to pursue careers in academia enter a very different environment from the one she did when she graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1968.
“I came at a time for women when nothing was expected of me. It seemed a miracle that I would graduate from college, it seemed even more of a miracle that I would get a Ph.D,” she said.
Faust acknowledged that with expanded opportunities for women come a greater pressure to succeed.
“Don’t be imprisoned by the expectations that I never had to deal with,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a four-part series analyzing how successful the 2009-2010 reforms have been in making the Administrative Board’s disciplinary process more educational, transparent, and empowering for accused students. Part II, Part III, and Part IV were published Oct. 24-26.
Nearly five years before Harvard’s current cheating scandal brought its disciplinary process into the national spotlight, a small committee was tasked with reforming the College’s enigmatic disciplinary body: the Administrative Board.
As they drafted their recommendations on issues ranging from advising to fact-finding, members of the Committee to Review the Administrative Board strived to create “a more educational process, rather than one that leaves people cynical and jaded,” recalled Matthew L. Sundquist ‘09, a former Undergraduate Council president who served as the committee’s only student member.
The committee’s emphasis on pedagogy was nowhere more apparent than in their recommendation to introduce new, less severe penalties for academic integrity cases. These “local sanctions”—which could range from tutoring to a failing grade on the assignment—were designed to remedy an approach that many criticized for linking educational wrongdoing with a punishment of questionable educational value: the requirement to temporarily withdraw from the College.
But now, two years after the reform was approved, new data raise questions about how effective the new local sanctions have been in aligning the Board’s punishments with its pedagogical mission.
The Board’s 2005-2012 records for academic integrity cases show that as faculty report far more students for academic dishonesty since the reform, the Board is issuing forced withdrawals for only a slightly smaller percentage of the cases that come its way. As a result, more cheaters are being asked to leave Harvard in the wake of the reform that many hoped would reduce the number of forced withdrawals.
This fall, some of the roughly 125 students accused of improperly collaborating in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” will likely be forced to take a year off from school, a punishment that some say will dog them long after their undergraduate years but teach them nothing about appropriate academic practices.
MORE OPTIONS, MORE WITHDRAWALS
In the years before the reforms, a reported perception among faculty members that the Board’s penalties were overly harsh generated concern among College administrators that professors were underreporting academic dishonesty.
In this climate, the committee proposed in its 2009 report that the “limited range of sanctions” then available to the Board be expanded to include penalties for academic dishonesty incidents that “could best be treated as teaching moments between the student and faculty member.”
For such cases, the committee advocated the creation of new options in an effort to remedy what they perceived as a one-size-fits-all approach, Sundquist said. These new local sanctions include required tutoring, a course warning, a required re-do of the assignment in question, a grade penalty, or a failing grade for the assignment. Students could also be “excluded” from a class, which would leave a mark on the transcript equivalent to a failing grade.
Now, after two full academic years with the reforms in place, Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote in an emailed statement that the local sanctions have been “very successful.” Neal declined to speak about the Ad Board in person or over the phone.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Lecturer Andrew Berry, who has informally advised students going before the Ad Board for academic dishonesty cases, said he thinks local sanctions have led students to view the Board less fearfully than before.
“The email from the Ad Board does look like the end of the world, but it’s less associated with hellfire than it used to be,” Berry said.
Last spring, Berry said, several of his students in Life Sciences 1b went before the Board for academic dishonesty infractions in a process that Berry thought reflected the nuances of the individual cases.
“Instead of escalating, things were dealt with in a more constructive way,” Berry recalled. “What could have been a brutal punishment turned into a teachable moment.”
At the end of the process, Berry said, “nobody who I felt didn’t deserve to be kicked out” was asked to withdraw.
In the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 academic years, 34.9 percent of academic dishonesty cases resulted in required withdrawals compared to 40.3 percent in the five years before the reform, according to statistics provided to The Crimson.
But in each of those two most recent years, more than 80 cases of academic dishonesty were reported to the Ad Board, almost double the average of 42 cases annually from 2005 to 2010. That jump meant a greater number of students forced to withdraw—an average of 29 students each year, up from 17—despite the availability of less severe penalties.
With local sanctions and course exclusions making up just over 20 percent of all total outcomes of academic dishonesty cases in the past two academic years, it is unclear how fully the reform has changed the Board’s punishment paradigm, or if it will play a role any role all in the current cheating investigation.
Neal declined to comment on whether local sanctions are being considered as a possible punishment in the Government 1310 case.
PEDAGOGICAL OR PUNITIVE?
While some maintain that the Board’s process and punishments serve its educative mission, critics argue that the nature of some of the Board’s punishments generate long-term consequences that make the Board a fundamentally punitive institution.
Harvard takes steps to ensure that student’s time away from the College is productive. Before they can be re-admitted to the College, students are required to hold non-academic employment for at least six months.
Arthur, a student who was forced to temporarily withdraw from the college, wrote in an emailed statement that although he was initially upset about his punishment, he now feels he has benefited from the experience.
“I am enjoying my time off and think that the requirement for 6 months of non-academic work is great,” wrote Arthur, who requested that his name be changed because he did not want it known that he had been forced to withdraw from school. “I don’t have any antipathy for the Ad Board anymore.”
But Michael R. Schneider, a lawyer who has served as a consultant for students facing the Ad Board process, questioned the educative value of such a punishment.
“The Ad Board’s philosophy really understates or ignores the very punitive nature of the sanctions that they impose,” Schneider said, referring to required withdrawals. “The University needs to realize that it is really making it difficult for some really solid students who may have had one lapse in their academic careers.”
Paulette G. Curtis ’92, who served as resident dean of Dunster House from 2002 to 2008, also questioned whether the Board was fundamentally educational. She called that description “a bit imprecise” because it does not “incorporate the full spectrum of intentions.”
Instead, Curtis said, the Board’s mission is twofold: Board members strive to educate students about academic integrity while simultaneously upholding the University’s reputation as an institution that places high value on honest authorship. That second mission, she said, sometimes requires consequences that some may perceive as punitive.
LASTING CONSEQUENCES
Biology professor Richard M. Losick, who has served as a personal adviser for students before the Ad Board, said that the most punitive element of a forced withdrawal is the permanent note that goes on a student’s record following that punishment.
While probation is only temporarily noted on a student’s transcript during the period of punishment, a forced withdrawal leaves a permanent mark, though the reason for the withdrawal is not indicated.
“If you’re kicked out for a year and that’s on your record, that’s not educational. That’s a severe punishment,” Losick said. “A lot is at stake.”
Schneider said that he has spoken with medical school and law school admissions officers who have admitted that such a mark on the transcript significantly lowers a student’s chance of admission.
Daniel, a student implicated in the Government 1310 scandal who asked that his name be changed because he did not want it known that he was accused of cheating, agreed that transcript marks have the power to affect a student’s career after college.
“Everyone knows that if you get required to withdraw, that’s almost the kiss of death in the academic realm,” Daniel said.
Neal, however, defended the permanent mark on the transcript, saying it is a necessary explanation of a student’s historical record at the College.
Neal wrote that administrators strive to ensure that this mark does not serve as an insurmountable obstacle for students in the future.
Curtis said that many of her students returned to Harvard after a forced withdrawal with a new perspective, drive, and focus on their academic careers. In such cases, Curtis said, she could write letters of recommendation that acknowledged a student’s disciplinary infraction while also emphasizing their holistic success at Harvard.
“I could often very honestly say that that was a blip on the screen, that was a moment that was difficult for the student, but they have since picked themselves up,” she said, adding these students were often successful in their efforts to find employment or go to graduate school.
EDUCATION IN THE SPOTLIGHT
But there are some marks that the College cannot help students explain away, a fact particularly evident in the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
Last month, reports circulated that the captains of the men’s basketball team, Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13, planned to voluntarily withdraw from Harvard because of possible disciplinary action stemming from their involvement in the scandal.
Transcripts aside, Casey and Curry will be linked to the cheating scandal if ever a potential employer decides to Google them.
Gary Pavela, a former Director of Academic Integrity at Syracuse University who has also consulted with other institutions, said that the publicity of a case such as the Government 1310 scandal undermines the ability of a disciplinary board to educate involved students.
A better solution, he said, is to educate students about their mistakes without creating long-term negative consequences. At Syracuse, he said, first-time violators of the academic integrity policy are typically punished with a failing grade in the course and a mark on their transcripts. That mark disappears after a student successfully completes a not-for-credit seminar designed to educate students about proper academic practices and the importance of trust between a student and teacher.
But Neal wrote that because so many cases of academic dishonesty are the result of an overstressed student searching for a shortcut, “it would not always be prudent to add new seminars or classes to that burden.”
But Pavela disagreed, citing national studies that show a correlation between an increasing number of academic dishonesty cases and decreasing student workloads.
And while Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said at the time the scandal was announced that administrators went public with the investigation in part so that they could “treat it as a teaching opportunity,” some say that Harvard is missing the point.
Daniel, the student involved in the current scandal, said he believes that by bringing the massive case to the Ad Board, Harvard has scapegoated students in Government 1310 instead of addressing the larger pedagogical issues that could lead up to 125 students to cheat on a single test.
Rather than punishing students, Daniel said, Harvard should be facilitating conversations to educate faculty about how to be more clear about their expectations and to teach students about appropriate usage of study guides and other methods of collaboration.
By focusing on punishment, Daniel said, “I think you miss important teaching moments that could really, really be good for the Harvard community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions, food waste, trash, water use, and the number of commuters who drive solo to campus, according to a University-wide Sustainability Impact Report released by the Office for Sustainability on Monday.
The report—the first of its kind—also highlighted programs designed to forward research related to energy and the environment and also detailed progress made by way of 78 LEED-certified green construction projects. Twenty-three more LEED projects are now registered and in the works.
“Every member of the Harvard community has contributed to our success, and, as always, I am proud of the creativity and commitment I see at work on our campus every day,” said University President Drew G. Faust in a message to the Harvard community.
The report states that, despite 3 million square feet of physical growth, the campus has achieved a 16 percent drop in its greenhouse gas emissions. This reduction lines up with the 2008 University goal to decrease such emissions by 30 percent by 2016.
In her message to the community, President Faust described Harvard’s previous approach to sustainability in 2008.
“In addition to pursuing our innovative research and teaching in this area, it was critical that we look inward to expand our on-campus efforts to make Harvard a healthier, more efficient, and more sustainable place to work, learn, and live,” she wrote in an email and said in an accompanying video.
The report also focused on changes in human behavior.
The number of commuters who drive alone to the Cambridge and Allston campuses has decreased by half since 1999.
Currently, 79 percent of commuters bike, walk, or use public transit to get to work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students prepare to fill out their mail-in ballots and campus groups make their final campaign pushes, Harvard students turned their attention to the last presidential debate on Monday evening.
At an event hosted by the Institute of Politics, over 700 students gathered to witness President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney go head to head on issues of American foreign policy.
“It’s very significant in the United States in particular given our role on the global front,” said Ved V. Topkar ’16, who watched the debate with the Harvard Political Review at the IOP.
“Foreign policy is one of the issues that can have a lot of discrepancies between parties,” he added.
Even several international students who will not be voting in November attended the event to learn more about the candidates’ positions.
“I’d like to see what the U.S. is going to do with the wars it has not been involved with and whether either of the candidates is going to take action,” Minh D. Trinh ’15 said.
HKS student Julia L. Fetherston said, “For international students, this is a great chance to get a taste of American politics.”
Beginning with the attack on the U.S. embassy in Libya and the ongoing violence in Syria, the debate was focused on the Middle East—namely the extent of American military involvement in the region.
“I think the Middle East is definitely important and needs to be discussed in one of the debates,” Julia N. Becerra ’16 said.
At a point in the race when polls show the candidates neck and neck, the J.F.K. Forum sounded like the set of a sitcom as students cheered, laughed and jeered at the candidates.
“It’s great to be here and listen to the sounds of the crowd,” Topkar said.
Moderator Bob Schieffer, host of CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” elicited heated exchanges between Obama and Romney and pushed the two men to articulate their ideas on America’s role in the world.
“Obviously foreign policy is a huge issue, and it’s interesting to see what the candidates’ views are,” Rohan K. Reddy ’16 said.“Both are making extremely valid points, but I think Romney is fluffing his points a bit more than Obama is.”
Kyle E. Dempsey, a Harvard Medical School student who identified as an independent voter, said that Obama performed much better than he did during the first debate.
“I would give the edge slightly to Obama, but I don’t think either candidate had a knockout performance,” Dempsey said. “Romney could have been a bit more pointed and specific. It seemed like he gave a lot of rhetoric.”
The debate strayed to domestic economic issues as the questions turned to China and the candidates discussed government stimulus and bailouts.
“Foreign policy matters, but I think the economy will be what sways people because it is what most affects everyday life,” Becerra said.
With the election only two weeks away, latest polls show the candidates neck to neck—with nominees taking leads by razor-thin margins in different swing states.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With only two weeks until election day, women’s issues have become the latest and perhaps final flashpoint in Massachusetts’s much-watched U.S. Senate race, providing insight into both campaigns’ strategy and encapsulating much of the derision that has characterized the contest thus far.
The debate surrounding women’s issues, which has emerged at various points during the race, reclaimed center stage a week and half ago during a debate between the candidates in Springfield.
Though the political conversation has focused on U.S. Senator Scott Brown’s stances on a number of key issues affecting women, more important to the campaigns is how the debate may influence the demographics of voters showing up to the polls on Election Day, political strategists say.
In the Oct. 10 debate, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren attacked Brown for voting against equal pay for equal work, insurance coverage for contraception, and against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.
“He didn’t offer an amendment to say ‘here’s what we can do to make this better,’” Warren said in a conference call with college journalists. “He just voted in lockstep with the other Republicans to say no....And those are bad votes for women.”
Brown, who is a moderate Republican, said he voted against the bills in question because they were bad legislation, not because he does not support women.
Since the debate, the argument has spilled over into advertisements and onto the campaign trail as both sides have tried to make their case to women, Massachusetts’s dominant voting group. On Monday, Brown received the endorsement of Laurie Myers, a leading advocate for female abuse victims, and pledged to be an advocate for women in the Senate.
Warren spent the weekend campaigning with U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, raising awareness about Brown’s voting record and advocating for equal rights for women and the LGBTQ community.
But political strategists say the back and forth has more to do with the broader electoral goals of each campaign than with the issues themselves.
For Warren, women’s issues are a chance to excite her own base and tie Brown to the national Republican Party.
For Brown, whose base consists of male voters, capturing the votes of certain segments of independent women will be key to winning the heavily Democratic Bay State.
Former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. Dicara ’71 said that the focus on women is part of a larger effort by Warren’s campaign to optomize voter turnout. Historically, higher voter turnout in Massachusetts translates to a more female and more Democratic electorate—which means more votes for Warren.
“Warren’s trying to create a wedge between Brown and women voters that she can use to get more women to the polls,” said Republican political consultant Rob Gray.
Tying Brown to the national GOP and to former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney could push those tallies even higher, Gray said. Massachusetts is expected to overwhelmingly support Democratic President Barack Obama, but turnout is also expected to fall from 2008 levels as excitement around the presidential race wanes.
“The presidential race in this blue state can and does trickle down to Senate races,” Gray said. “[The Warren camp’s] hope is that voters conclude that Brown is just like Romney and vote a straight ticket Democrat.”
Brown’s campaign has worked hard to resist that link, DiCara said, but the association may be hard to shake. Even as Brown has shown himself to be a strong advocate of women, his party’s stances on abortion and affirmative action may undercut his efforts to paint himself as progressive representative for women.
“Scott Brown himself is probably okay on women’s issues,” DiCara said. “The real issue is not Scott Brown, but it’s the people who will end up having the gavels in the Senate if the Republicans have a majority.”
Though Brown will need to attract the votes of blue-collar women who tend to vote Democratic in order to win, his success is still largely dependent on men’s votes.
The same gender gap that gives Warren a leg up among women, gives Republicans like Brown and advantage among me, Gray said.
“If he can drive up the number of white males that are supporting him that will help him against Warren’s advantage among female voters,” said Democratic political consultant Dan Payne.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What began as an overlooked complaint about a broken elevator in the Baldwin School polling place for the Massachusetts state primary on Sep. 6 exploded into a contentious argument over Cambridge election policies at the City Council meeting Monday night.
Councillor Marjorie C. Decker visited the polling place at the Baldwin School on Election Day in September as a candidate and noted that the elevator was not in service, leaving many voters unable to reach the polls, which were located down a flight of stairs.
Voters were given alternative options, including directions to alternate polling locations or a confidential envelope with which they could submit their ballot to an official, but Decker said on Monday that the number of voters hindered by the broken elevator was not adequately counted by polling officials.
“We don’t know how many voters showed up and left,” she said.
She had communicated the problem on Election Day with the City Manager’s Office in the hopes that it would reach the Election Commission for further review.
But Election Commission Executive Director Tanya Ford responded by saying that the Commission had not received that complaint, or any others about the elevator.
Ford characterized the underlying problem as a lack of communication between Election Commission officials, the City Manager’s Office, and the poll workers at the Baldwin School.
“I think we have a problem getting through to the workers how important it is the job they do,” she said. “They communicated to you, and I wish they had contacted myself or the commissioners, but that was not the case.”
The response of the Commission left some councilors concerned that poll workers and wardens were not adequately prepared to handle election emergencies.
“Hindsight is 20/20 vision, but there are some emergencies you have to predict. At my polling place, one of the workers died! In the morning!” said Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ‘72.
“I don’t know if it’s additional training of the wardens, if that’s the question here, “ he continued. “I think there should be some kind of emergency plan at the poll to understand what plan B is if plan A is not working, ahead of time.”
The discussion of the elevator malfunction at the Baldwin School opened the floodgates for the Council to air its election-related grievances. Councillor Craig Kelley expressed concern that polling facilities were not being thoroughly inspected by Election Committee officials before Election Day, while Councillor Timothy Toomey asked City Manager Robert Healy to investigate whether polling venues chosen were large and well-staffed enough to handle the crowds anticipated.
In the end, however, the discussion returned to the Baldwin School elevator.
Councillor Decker was not satisfied with the Election Commission’s evaluation of the events, and what she saw as an unwillingness to address and reform past problems.
“My issue isn’t that the elevator was broken, because things do break. My issue is what is the protocol installed and what is the accountability,” Decker said.
“I leave this conversation a little more concerned than when I went into it,” she added.
The issue was referred back to the City Manager’s Office, with the request that a full report about the elevator be brought before the Council at its next meeting on the evening of Nov. 5. The general election will take place the next day, Nov. 6.
A far less contentious issue on the Council’s agenda was a resolution affirming the Massachusetts Cultural Council’s decision to award the Central Square Cultural District the status of a state-designated cultural district.
The resolution passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though women's volleyball's Taylor Docter is our Athlete of the Week, a few other Crimson athletes turned in performances over the weekend that deserve some recognition. This week, we have three runners-up for Athlete of the Week.
Kyle Juszczyk, Football
Although the Harvard loss to Princeton marked the end of the Crimson's winning streak, Juszczyk had a career game on Saturday. The senior tight end had fourteen receptions for 192 yards. Juszcyzk also registered three touchdowns for Harvard, a single-game career high. He particularly excelled in the first half, when he made two of his touchdowns and received 10 passes for 147 yards. His final touchdown of the game came in the 15th minute of the second half when he received an 8-yard pass from Chapple, putting the Crimson at a 27-10 lead.
Colton Chapple, Football
Despite a loss to Princeton, 39-34, Chapple helped the Crimson maintain a lead for the majority of the game on Saturday. The senior quarterback threw for 448 yards, a record for single-game play, edging out the Tigers’ passing yards by 161 yards. Chapple also tied his record high of five touchdowns in a single-game and ran for 82 yards. Chapple’s play allowed the Crimson to hold off Princeton until the last thirteen seconds. Chapple now has accumulated 1819 passing yards and 18 touchdowns. This is Chapple’s fourth straight appearance on the AOTW runners-up list.
Colin Woolway, Men's Water Polo
Freshman Colin Woolway had a career game against Mercyhurst on Saturday afternoon, just two hours after a loss to St. Francis, 14-9. Although the Crimson fell to Mercyhurst, 11-10, Woolway registered 19 saves. The freshman goalie, who splits time with junior Jimmy Field, has now accumulated 119 saves. He has also has chipped in four assists and four steals for the Crimson this season.

After coming back from a one-set deficit against Dartmouth on Friday to take a 2-1 lead, the Harvard women’s volleyball team led 8-4 in the fourth. Unbeknownst to captain and outside hitter Taylor Docter, she was only one kill away from breaking into the Crimson’s top-10 career kills leaders.
“I hadn’t been following at all,” Docter said. “My mom probably follows more than I do; she probably had it on her radar, but I had no clue. I’m glad no one said anything because that would have maybe made me nervous.”
Docter didn’t look nervous as she leapt to play a ball from freshman setter Hannah Schmidt and dropped it between the Big Green’s defense, registering her 15th and final kill of the evening.
Docter’s tenth double-double of the season—she reached 15 kills and 15 digs—was instrumental in Harvard’s victory, its first win against Dartmouth since 2008 and the first of Docter’s Crimson volleyball career.
“Dartmouth has always been one of those teams we have been very evenly matched with, but it has been one of those games where we walk away thinking we should have won, which is one of the worst feelings,” Docter said. “It felt really good to finally feel like we performed the way we should have.”
Docter’s final kill gave her 922 on her career, tying her with Katie Turley-Molony ’07.
“It’s exciting, especially because we still have six games, so hopefully I can get in some more kills and move up the list,” said Docter, who currently trails Katherine Hart ’01 by 11 kills.
Since her freshman year, Docter has developed into the Crimson’s top offensive threat. She currently ranks fifth in Crimson history in attack attempts, sixth in service aces, and eighth in kills per set average. Despite now reaching the top ten in a fourth category, Docter is more concerned with winning games than personal achievements.
“She’s very excited about all of that, but she doesn’t want to be in the limelight,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said. “She just wants the whole team to do well. She is very much a team player and it’s so genuine, which is refreshing to see.”
Docter credits her teammates for her success, especially Schmidt. Harvard plays with two setters on the court, but the rookie is the one who supports Docter in most of her kills because of her place in the rotation.
“She has been doing an awesome job,” Docter said. “A lot of the reason we are doing better recently is because she has totally sped up her offense.”
Friday’s game was a showcase of the Crimson’s attack, which led Harvard back after the team dropped the first set. The Crimson displayed a balanced attack in its 3-1 victory, with Docter, junior right side Erin Cooney, and freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace all registering double-digit kills for Harvard.
After going 2-9 to open the season—including a loss to the Big Green in September—the Crimson is currently riding a three-game winning streak, its longest of the season. Docter believes that her and the team’s recent success is a testament to teamwork.
“When you are playing with the same girls every year, a lot of it just comes from getting better at playing with the girls next to you,” Docter said. “They help me look good because they are improving as well.”
After playing front row as a freshman, Docter has put in the hard work to become a more well-rounded player. Each year she has seen increased playing time in the back row, and this year she is playing all six rotations.
“She has always been an impact attacker for us,” Weiss said. “She is diversifying her shots, and she has worked on the back row attack and the defense. [The record] is a credit to her hard work and belief that practice matters.”
Weiss credits Docter’s fitness level and focus entering the season.
“She was here this summer working in the lab but she was also working out,” Weiss said. “She’s very diligent about that so when we got to preseason she was ready to go. She has really committed a lot of time and energy to the team.”
And now Docter has permanently cemented her place in Harvard history. With six games left to play, she has ample opportunity to climb the all-time career list. Docter, who averages 3.19 kills per set, sits 53 behind seventh-place Kat McKinley ’09.
“Taylor is a gifted athlete and a hard worker,” Weiss said. “If you stay patient over time, good things will happen, and good things are happening for her.”

In an improbable comeback victory, the Princeton Tigers (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) upended the Harvard football team (5-1, 2-1) this weekend, scoring 29 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to notch a 39-34 win and secure sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.
In a way, the Crimson got an early dose of Halloween at Princeton this weekend.
The trick? A slew of misfortunes, in part inspired by missed opportunities from Harvard and in part exacerbated by a suddenly unstoppable Tigers offense, that led to the Crimson’s first loss of the season, ending its nation-leading 14-game winning streak.
At the half, the Crimson held a commanding 20-0 lead over the Princeton with two scores from senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk and a score from junior receiver Ricky Zorn. Harvard looked every bit the dominant force it has been all season, defeating its opponents by an average margin of 27.6 points and receiving a first-place vote in The Sports Network FCS poll.
The third period and beginning of the fourth were more of the same for the Crimson, with the defense limiting the Tigers to a touchdown and a field goal off a fumble recovery while posting two additional scores to Juszczyk and fellow tight end Cameron Brate to go up, 34-10, with 13:02 left in the fourth quarter.
Then, all at once, things started to fall apart. Princeton pounced on opportunities time and time again, capitalizing on good field position created by defense that forced the Harvard offensive side to go three-and-out and blocked a punt attempt and field goal attempt.
Three touchdown passes from sophomore Connor Michelson and two successful two-point conversion attempts brought the Tigers to within a possession of the Crimson, 34-32, with under three minutes remaining in the contest.
And then, it happened. Princeton forced Harvard to a three-and-out punt, but the Crimson was able to pin the Tigers at their 10-yard line with just under two minutes to go in regulation. A sack took Michelson out of the game with less than a minute to go, forcing Princeton to substitute sophomore Quinn Epperly.
With 13 seconds to go and mass confusion on the field, Epperly heaved a 36-yard prayer to the back corner that junior Roman Wilson was able to haul in, sealing the deal for the Tigers, 39-34.
Impossible? No, but very improbable.
While Princeton was supposed to be one of the Crimson’s toughest challenges en route to its second straight Ivy League title, no one could have predicted the wild finish to Saturday’s game.
This begs the question of whether the Tigers’ stunning finish is merely a pre-Halloween trick, a fluke loss that Harvard will be able to come back from and look past with ease, or something more serious.
The loss to Princeton puts the Crimson in a three-way tie for second place in the Ivy League with Dartmouth and Penn, two teams that are on the remaining part of Harvard’s schedule.
The Big Green is 4-2, 2-1 in the Ivy League, while the Quakers are 2-4 but still maintain a 2-1 record in the Ivy League. Taking a closer look at the box score against the Tigers, it doesn’t look like the Crimson offense struggled at all to put points on the board against Princeton, at least through three quarters and a good part of the fourth.
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple was 31 for 45, torching Princeton for 448 yards and five touchdowns with support from Kyle Juszczyk’s 15 receptions, 192 yards, three touchdowns, and Treavor Scales’ 21 carries and 104 yards.
The Crimson will need the continued hot play of its core players on offense and defense to remain in contention for its second consecutive Ivy League title. But after watching the secondary struggle defending consecutive scores against the Tigers and giving up a last-second heave by backup quarterback Quinn Epperly, allowing Princeton to march down with relative ease, nothing seems like a given anymore.
Harvard will have to treasure each and every victory moving forward as a treat. A loss is a loss and the Crimson will go into Halloween weekend with a different mindset than it had before, not basking in the glow of gaining national attention with its 14-game winning streak and high consideration in the FCS, but rather with a tough loss to a team that it should have beaten.
Hopefully it will be able to shed its mask of inefficacy and come back bigger, stronger, and badder.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the weekend that marked the midpoint of its season, the Harvard sailing team competed in four separate tournaments in New England in one of its final tune-ups before the qualifiers for the Atlantic Coast Championships.
The team placed in the top 10 in its two in-conference meets—seventh at the Central Series, held at Boston College, and ninth at the Oberg, hosted by Northeastern.
In its intersectional meets, the Crimson placed 12th at the Sherman Hoyt Trophy, held at Brown, and 10th at the Stu Nelson Trophy, hosted by MIT. Sophomore Richard Biergsund, who sailed at Oberg, said that after the departure of a senior class that included All-American Brendan Kopp ’12, the team has turned to a host of freshmen and sophomores to fill the void.
“We are a very young team this year,” Beirgsund said. “Since we are so young, we’ve had to adapt to a lot of different weather situations and conditions. We are working really hard on consistency and winning more than one race at a time, and that comes from minimizing mistakes out there.”
SHERMAN HOYT TROPHY
Sailing in unfamiliar boats and in difficult weather conditions, Harvard finished 10th in the A Division at the Sherman Hoyt trophy and 14th in the B division.
Freshmen Sydney Karnvosky and Gram Slattery teamed up in the A division and won the ninth race of the regatta. The team had four single-digit finishes overall and ended the weekend with a score of 116 points. The Crimson started out with top-10 finishes in five of the first seven races and finished worse than 12th only twice.
“The boats that we sailed with this weekend have a different handling than what we are used to,” Karnovsky explained. “The ones that we practice with are much faster to tack and drive and are more sensitive. The differences are things that you wouldn’t notice looking at the boat from far away, but when you are on the boat you have to adjust.”
Karnovsky echoed Biergsund’s sentiment and said that the team has to work on maintaining its focus throughout all the weekend’s races.
“We have all the ingredients to do well in races and we need to put stuff together every race,” Karnovsky said. “If we have one bad race or two bad races, that really hurts us, and we need to be consistent out there. We want to be consistently in the top half of races and making sure those 10, 11, or 12 finishes are six, seven, and eights instead.”
OBERG
At the Oberg, the Harvard A team finished in 12th place, ending strong with two top-four results in its last three races. The B team—featuring Bergsund and freshman Jacob Bradt—took 10th in its division and the C team finished in seventh. In adverse weather conditions, the Crimson adjusted to shifting wind and rain.
“This weekend, the wind was really shifty on the water,” Bergsund said. “You had to move really quickly to keep up on the shifts and keep your head out of your boat to watch the wind on the water. The challenge this weekend was changing our plans as the breeze made its way around the course.”
STU NELSON TROPHY
At the Stu Nelson Trophy, the Harvard B team closed the weekend 11th overall, while the A team finished ninth. The A team had six top-five results and won the 14th race of the day. The Crimson started strong and ended up no lower than 11th in its first 10 races and finished in the top five four times in that span.
The B team split time between two groups of racers, with freshman Sophie Bermudez and junior Isabel Ruane teaming up for the first 12 races of the weekend and junior Morgan Watson and classmate Jacquelyn Cooley racing the final six. The team won its ninth race of the weekend and had 10 top-10 finishes overall.
CENTRAL SERIES
At the Central Series, Harvard finished seventh in both divisions. The Crimson ended up behind both teams from Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth, which finished first and fourth.
Junior Ames Lyman and senior Nicholas Gordon manned the A boat, ending the weekend with five top-10 finishes.Freshman Matthew Clarida and sophomore Deirdre Buckley anchored the B team for Harvard, which finished only 16 points behind sixth-place Tufts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Still reeling from Harvard football’s 39-34 loss at Princeton this weekend? Need to put those 29 unanswered fourth quarter points in perspective? Hey, things could be worse, right? Right? Below are four Crimson losses from the past twelve years that just might rival Saturday’s bummer (or send faithful fans spiraling even deeper into despair).
Football: Cornell 29, Harvard 28 - October 10, 2000
In a Harvardian collapse similar to last weekend’s affair, the Big Red scored 29 unanswered second-half points at Soldier’s Field to deny the Crimson an upset win. Harvard had Cornell on the ropes with less than four minutes left in the game before Big Red quarterback Ricky Rahne connected with receiver Tim Hermann on fourth and five for a 48-yard touchdown to go ahead, 29-28.
Cornell missed the following two-point conversion attempt, giving the Crimson one last chance to win. Harvard quarterback Neil Rose methodically picked apart the Big Red defense as the Crimson drove to the Cornell 10. With 37 seconds left, coach Tim Murphy elected to have Rose take a knee to set up a last-second 27-yard field goal attempt.
But as time expired, Big Red co-captain Joe Splendorio tipped freshman Robbie Wright’s kick wide-right.
Men’s hockey: Maine 5, Harvard 4 - March 26, 2004
For 40 minutes, Harvard dominated the nation’s No. 1-ranked team in the first round of the 2004 NCAA Tournament.
In the first two periods, the Crimson put four pucks past Maine goaltender Jimmy Howard, a current NHL starter the Detroit Red Wings who entered the tournament with an NCAA-leading 1.05 goals-against average. Harvard entered the third period with a 4-1 advantage, and a desperate Black Bears squad elected to bench Howard for the final frame.
But then Maine began to play like the No. 1-ranked team in the country, scoring four unanswered third-period goals in what Crimson writer Jon Paul Morosi described as a “slow, agonizing death.” The Black Bears scored the go-ahead goal with 4:10 remaining to hand the Crimson its third straight first round postseason exit. Maine would advance to the national final, where it fell to Denver.
Women’s hockey: Wisconsin 1, Harvard 0 - March 11, 2007
The Harvard women’s hockey team ended up on the wrong side of the second-longest game in women’s collegiate hockey, playing 127 minutes of scoreless hockey before falling to Wisconsin in the fourth overtime of the 2007 NCAA quarterfinals.
With 67 stops, goaltender Brittany Martin kept the Crimson in the game as she tied the Harvard record for the most saves in a single game. Yet on the other end of the rink, the Badger defense limited the Crimson to only 36 shots on goal during the six-plus periods of play. Making the loss more painful, Wisconsin went on to win its next two games by comfortable margins to capture the national championship.
But Harvard’s 2007 NCAA Tourney elimination was not its only difficult OT loss that year. The Crimson also lost in triple overtime to Boston College in the 2007 Beanpot semifinal, which also ranks among the longest college games of all time.
Men's basketball: Princeton 63, Harvard 62 - March 12, 2011
It doesn’t get much worse than this. A 15-foot buzzer-beater by Princeton guard Doug Davis put an exclamation point on 65 years of frustration for the Crimson, whose hopes for its first NCAA tournament bid since 1946 were dashed with a single shot.
Harvard had clinched a share of the Ivy League title seven days earlier with a commanding 79-65 win over the Tigers at Lavietes. But in the Yale-hosted playoff for the Ivy League’s automatic tournament bid, Princeton came to play. The back-and-forth game featured four lead changes in the final minute alone as Davis’s last-second jumper punched the Tigers’ ticket to the Dance.

Going to a reputable university like Harvard has its downsides: having to drop the H-Bomb, saying you go to school in Boston, and dealing with so called "Harvard Problems." We've all heard people say "I have too many amazing classes to choose from" or "I have to climb too many stairs to get to my room because of the high ceilings." As a reprieve, Flyby brings you a list of some "humbling" posts from Gawker and Jezebel.
Admissions 101
Gawker joined the fray of media outlets covering a Hong Kong family's failed investments to try and get their kids into Harvard. Gawker passes on this useful advice: "Always, always bribe the school directly."
Illustrious Alumni
Gawker updates us on the whereabouts of infamous Ted "Unabomber" Kaczynski '62  and gets a classmate to share his thoughts. Gary G. Peterson '62 said that there is an amusing side to having such an infamous peer: "he's more famous than anyone else in our class."
Conan and The Voice
Gotta give Jezebel credit on this one. The popular blog targeted The Harvard Voice's article that attracted controversy for its portrayal of racial stereotypes. Yet the critique is also thinly veiled praise for Conan O'Brien: "I think a certain Lampoon [a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine] alumni needs to go back and teach a schoolwide course in satire, irony, humor, and maybe also, having cute red hair and being extra tall and adorable. Yes?"
Big Balls
Finally some praise for Harvard as Gawker commends Crimson President E. Benjamin Samuels '13 and Managing Editor Julie M. Zauzmer ’13 for having "Bigger Balls Than Your Media Boss." But true to Gawker fashion, the praise fades quickly.
"Remember all the great stuff you could do before life slowly pummeled your courage and drive into a fine powder you then washed away with booze?" the blog tells its readers.
Words of Wisdom
 To end on a helpful note, Gawker advises all of us Harvard students to keep this in mind: "One downside of being the future rulers of America's political and economic fortunes: makes it really hard to pull off jokes in which the premise is, 'the idea of us being rich elitists is laughable.'" Still, Gawker tells us to "Keep trying, though. Not really."

In 1990, a team of scientists re-created the impacts of the September 1938 hurricane in a two-acre patch of the Harvard Forest by flattening the majority of the trees. According to an article published in the Harvard Gazette, after monitoring the forest for 20 years, they found that leaving the forest as was with the watch-and-wait policy and not engaging in salvage logging, as is a common response to storms, allows the forest to naturally recover to its lush, healthy state.
Here are some other examples of times when "doing nothing" is the best course of action:
1. When you have investments in Apple. The multi-billion dollar company has had substantial success in the stock market over the past thirty years. Imagine if you purchased stock when Apple went public in 1980. At least wait until the next iPhone comes out before you make any decisions.
2. When you have the sniffles. Everyone thinks medicine can fix everything, and doctors nowadays are prescribing medicine like it's going out of style. However, your body is equipped to fight small unwelcome viruses and infections. Sometimes, the best medicine is hot tea and a nap.
3. When the main character dies. The tragedy of Shakespeare's romances can leave readers upset and frustrated in love and life, but there's simply nothing we can do to save Anne Frank, Dumbledore, Gregor from "The Metamorphosis," and Willy Loman from "Death of a Salesman." Let yourself mourn, then move on.
4. When you are over-worked and over-stressed. Some psychologists say it is important to make time for yourself. The Art of Doing Nothing requires you to breathe, relax, and take a moment to reflect. With midterms in full swing, you might find taking a breather can help more than it hurts.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is sit back, relax, and let the world take its course.

What’s in your trash? Archaeologists-in-training were determined to turn their trash into treasure at the Archaeology Discovery Room in the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on Saturday October 20. This “trash,” as the children learned, actually had scientific value in the archeological sense.
Some of Harvard’s MayaArch3D team, reasearchers committed to creating architertural models, came to exhibit their high resolution 3D models of ancient Mayan artifacts as they spoke about how this new technology allows them to share these discoveries with the world.
Kids of all ages not only learned how these images were constructed and how the objects were found, but also how to describe various bones, scientific tools, and ancient pottery, discussing their origins and learning about what kinds of communities may have once used them.
The Roving Reporter was lucky enough to catch a few scientists in the making.
Ryan, 11
RR: Did you measure the pipe stems from the Harvard Yard Archeology Project?
Ryan: Maybe.
RR: I don’t get it.
Ryan: Well if you haven’t done it yet then you’ll just use my answer.
RR: I promise you I won’t.
Ryan: How do I know you’re telling the truth?
RR: You don’t.
Ryan: See what I mean?
Bianca, 13
RR: Were you as good at making pottery as some of these communities were?
Bianca: Well, I once made a coffee cup for my mom for Mother’s Day.
RR: How sweet of you! Does she use it?
Bianca: No, she doesn’t drink tea or coffee.
RR: I’m sorry.
Bianca: It’s okay. I’m dressing up as her for Halloween.
Arianna, 12
RR: What was your favorite table at the Archaeology Discovery Room?
Arianna: The one where you can figure out which animals the bones came from.
RR: And what did you find out?
Arianna: That the bones came from a cow!!!!
RR: Did that freak you out a little?
Arianna: No, I’m not a vegetarian.
RR: But isn’t it weird to touch part of a dead animal?
Arianna: Hamburgers aren’t alive either. Shouldn’t it be weird to eat them too?
RR: 10 points to Arianna.
Ned, 12
RR: So what did you think of the Mayan archaeology?
Ned: The stuff was cool. I liked how we could see it in 3D.
RR: Did you know that Mayans predicted that the world would end in 2012?
Ned: 2012 isn’t over yet. There is still time.
RR: Great.
Parker, 9
RR: So do you use any of these tools that the archaeologists use?
Parker: Yes, the tape measure and the ruler.
RR: What do you do with them?
Parker: You know, building Legos, constructing things.
RR: I was never really a “construction” kid growing up.
Parker: What does that mean?
RR: I wasn’t really good at building stuff. I was better at playing music.
Parker: You sound like you were just lazy.
RR: Right. Well some people are just good at different things.
Parker: And some people are bad at others.

Last night, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney sat down for a third and final presidential debate before election day. Although the close proximity of the candidates and moderator Bob Schieffer didn't quite produce the verbal fireworks we saw between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan when they were seated in the same format two weeks ago, we did hear quite a lot from both sides of the table (literally). Fortunately, Flyby stayed alert and on BS-patrol. For one last time, we're back to help you sort through some of the evening's more memorable moments.
1. Romney: "Promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America. We didn't ask for it. But it's an honor that we have it."
You're right, Mitt. In fact, we told them that's how it was gonna be. Thanks, John Winthrop.
2. Obama: "If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken…"
Yeah, about that. Afghanistan in '01 and Iraq in '03 never did quite top Hawaii '08.
3. Schieffer: "Obama's bin Laden."
Oof, Bob. This guy's been president for the last four years, not hiding out in the mountains of Pakistan. We know you were born in 1937, but get it together.
4. Obama: "Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships."
There goes the Hasbro endorsement, Mr. President—you just sunk that battleship.
5. Side note: Flyby supports breast cancer research (and we definitely give Obama props for mixing up the red and blue sartorial scheme with a pop of pink), but if you want to do wristbands right, we suggest taking a page from the Romney playbook.
6. Schleiffer: "I think we all love teachers."
Preach, Bob. Still, we can't help but feel that this comment fed into the candidates' seeming misconception that this foreign policy debate was actually all about education.
7. Obama: "What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership." And later: "America is a pacific power and we're going to have a presence there."
Bonus points for pulling out the alliteration in full force. But even if Romney kept his word choice squarely within the realm of the (third-grade) vernacular (see: "bad guys"), at least we know he's read his Robert Frost…
8. Romney: "There are two very different paths the country can take. One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece. I'll get us on track to a balanced budget."
Which will be your road less traveled? Perhaps the one that runs somewhere between Appleton and Philadelphia?…
9. Romney: "I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. I met a young woman in — in Philadelphia who's coming out of — out of college, can't find work. I've been — Ann was with someone just the other day…"
Word to the wise—if you can't remember a person, don't try to tell an anecdote about that time you met and promptly forgot them.
10. Finally, a shoutout to Bob Schieffer for citing his sources (perhaps they teach that better at Texas Christian University than they do at the candidates' alma mater): "Go vote; It'll made you feel big and strong." –Bob's mom
