After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High school senior Billy Orman, who finished sixth at the prestigious Foot Locker Cross Country Championships in 2010, has committed to Harvard and will be attending the college next fall. With one of the most highly rated cross country recruits under its belt, the Crimson has strengthened its young core of distance-running talent for years to come.
The interesting thing about Orman is that he will be moving to a whole new world when he sets foot in Harvard Yard. Tuba City, Ariz., his hometown, features desert-like conditions, an elevation of nearly 5000 feet, and a population less than 10000. This is much different from the freezing temperatures, sea-level elevation, and 100,000+ population of Cambridge, Mass.
In high school, Orman qualified for the Foot Locker nationals meet both his junior and senior years. He also won the Arizona state cross country meet and was recently named Gatorade Cross Country Athlete of the Year for Arizona. His PRs are impressive—9:04.97 (3200m) and 4:19.60 (1600m)—and both ESPNRise and MaxPreps regard him as one of the top distance runners in the nation. The Crimson is happy that Orman is bringing his talents to Cambridge.
As Harvard continues to build its cross country program, attracting some of the premier long-distance runners from around the nation, it will be better able to compete against the elite teams in the Ivy League and the NCAAs.

In a campus filled with pre-meds and aspiring investment bankers, any conversation about careers in fields like fashion and entertainment can be refreshing. On Friday, the Office of Career Services joined with AMBLE (Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs) to present the fifth annual Spring Career Conference, featuring panelists whose jobs in fashion, media, marketing, and entertainment have taken them off the stereotypical post-Harvard path.
 
Audience members peppered the panelists with questions about the industries they work in and their reasons for entering these fields. Karin J. Buchholz, a vice president for three New York sports teams—the Knicks, Rangers, and Liberty—who manages the teams' charitable and educational outreach programs, said, "My job combines my love for sports, business, marketing, and kids."
 
Steven R. Duque '08-'09, who during his time at Harvard made headlines both for co-founding "The Harvard Voice" and for more infamous activities, was also a panelist at the conference.
 "If you think you know what you're going to do in five years, then you're wrong. If you think you know what you're going to do in three years, then you're wrong," Duque said. Upon graduation, he spent a year "soul searching" while touring with his band Big Time. Afterward, he settled into his current job in marketing.
 
After the speeches, students mingled over dinner with panelists, who work for companies such as Estée Lauder, ESPN, People magazine, and Bloomingdale's. Networking seems to be the norm at any career conference—whether those awkward conversations are about finance or fashion.

After all the talk about the red carpet from tonight's Oscars, it might be a relief to turn your attention to a carpet of a different color.
The Office of Sustainability will be hosting the Green Carpet Awards, which honors members of the Harvard community who have improved sustainability on campus, again this year, and although the actual ceremony is not until April, tomorrow is the last chance to nominate an individual or team project for the ceremony.
"The program recognizes individuals who are working to make changes to the campus around them," said Brandon P. Geller '08, undergraduate resource efficiency program coordinator. "They are unsung heroes and this program gives them the credit they deserve."
