After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year, Thanksgiving break at Harvard College begins on Wednesday  and lasts until the following Monday. Although this year’s break,  which, for the first time in recent memory, includes Wednesday, it’s  high time that Harvard come to its senses, stop equivocating, and give  us the whole week off.
This year, we know that the administration reviewed a petition to  declare the whole week a University holiday but that the petition was  denied because of concerns over the condensed length of the semester. We  appreciate that Provost Steven E. Hyman entertained the proposal—made  in large part as a response to student requests—in the first place and,  of course, that it led to an extra day off.  Even still, we feel this  was a missed opportunity. Even with the condensed semester, Harvard, if  it wanted, could create a week-long holiday such as the one many of our  peer institutions enjoy.
Yale, for instance, began classes Aug. 31 this year; it will end fall  classes Dec. 2. Spring classes, however, start Jan. 9, and they end  April 23. At Harvard, by comparison, classes began this term Aug. 24,  and they end Dec. 2. Classes resume Jan. 23, and they end April 25. In  the fall term, at least, these dates—to us—look remarkably similar and  remarkably aligned. If the reason for denying the proposal was, as a  University spokesman wrote to The Crimson, over a concern for “three  additional missed days,” could those three days perhaps be replaced by  an earlier start day in August? As it stands—in what surely ranks among  the most absurd scheduling arrangements in recorded history—“Monday”  classes in the fall semester begin on a Wednesday, so might it be  possible, perhaps, to begin classes at the actual start of the week?  And, in doing so, have a week off in late November?
The Crimson will not attempt to convince its readers that Thanksgiving  is a holiday of tremendous significance—in addition to the comforts of  family, home, and celebration, it is also a much needed respite from the  pressures of the fall semester before exams begin. We realize that not  all Harvard students are able to travel home for the holiday next week,  but—regardless of whether they celebrate next Thursday at home with  their families or at a dining hall Thanksgiving feast with their  friends—all members of the Harvard community deserve the week off.
If the administration tried this year to bring about such a change to  the schedule, we have two words of advice for the year ahead: Try again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, continuing a long tradition of hard-fought gridiron battles between two of the oldest schools on this side of the pond, Harvard is heading off to Yale for The Game, a matchup first held in 1875.  We at The Crimson are very excited to watch this latest episode in our storied rivalry. And we look forward to making them eat dirt!
Yale’s quarterback, Patrick Witt, a senior, recently made the tough decision to play in The Game rather than attend his Rhodes Scholarship interview, and we admire his commitment to his school and team—but we think he’ll be regretting it when we are totally handing it to them at the end of the first quarter.
What we are facing is essentially a numbers game. Harvard, at 6-0, the recently crowned Ivy League champions seriously outmatch Yale, at 4-2, in a three-way tie for second place.  If we want to get even more into the numbers, it is the classic showdown between the elite and the riff-raff, the 6.2 percent, as an occupying student might say, versus the 7.9 percent.  Although the occupy protesters might argue differently when it comes to economic inequality, it seems impossible that anyone could hold a delusion that, in this contest at least, the 7.9 could hold a candle to the 6.2.
Additionally, for those students who have never been to New Haven before, we feel that we ought to warn you not to walk alone after dark, but we don’t want to ruin the surprise.  We’ll just leave it at New Haven is more beautiful than Yale deserves.
In all seriousness, we are very happy that The Game is back at Yale this year, we could always use an excuse to get off campus and go somewhere with, dare we say it, more social space!  The rules regarding tailgating and alcohol at Yale, which allow alcohol to be served at tailgates that can last until the beginning of the third quarter, are much better than our own (although this is the only area in which they surpass our institution’s eminence) and we encourage Harvard administrators to take notes and hopefully institute something similar when The Game is back here next year.
We wish everyone safe travel to The Game, and hope that you all stay safe, cheer hard, and bring inordinate amounts of school spirit.  We know that all of those Elis wish that they went to school here, so lets remind them why!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The latest chapter in the assault on American civil liberties has begun, and this time it is unfolding in a courthouse in downtown Boston. The trial of Tarek Mehanna , a young man from Sudbury, Massachusetts, has the potential to redefine the limits of free speech within draconian parameters that would essentially outlaw criticism of US foreign policy by American citizens. At the same time, it represents a general attack on Muslim-American communities, as it validates FBI tactics of spying in mosques, pressuring young Muslims into acting as informants, and the surveillance of American citizens under the flimsiest of pretexts.
The trial of Tarek Mehanna at Moakley Courthouse for conspiracy and “material support for terrorism” began on October 24. The date is significant; October 26, 2011 marked 10 years since the passage of the USA Patriot Act. This law has expanded the FBI’s ability to spy on American citizens with little or no oversight, legalizing secret searches of private property, private medical records, Internet usage, and anything else that leaves a record. The FBI does not even need to show that there is sufficient cause for suspicion; instead, as long as it claims the investigation is related to “terrorism,” it has writ large to search at will and use any evidence it finds in a court of law.
This case is occurring within the larger context of a wider crackdown on dissent against US foreign policy among Muslim communities in this country. Mehanna was an active member of his local mosque, and he was assertive and vocal in his criticisms of US foreign policy in the Middle East. Talking about resistance is not a crime, and discussing the right of Iraqis and Afghans to self-defense in a context of occupation, a right recognized in the Geneva Convention, is protected free speech. In an age of Islamophobic hysteria and fear at the prospect of “homegrown terror,” having the government pressure young men at mosques to turn in their friends for talking about being angry has become the new normal.
And for Tarek Mehanna, a doctor of pharmacy actively involved in Internet forums protesting the American invasion of Iraq, this is exactly what happened. After years of being pressured unsuccessfully by the FBI to inform on his friends at his local mosque, Mehanna was arrested for “lying to federal officials.” This lying, of course, had occurred during the process of trying to get the FBI to stop harassing him, and the FBI subsequently let him go, conscious that they lacked a coherent case. A year later, however, he was bundled away in the early morning hours, this time to be kept in 23-hour a day solitary confinement in a 10-foot by 15-foot cell at a maximum-security prison; he has been in those conditions for more than two years. The charges they added after his second arrest were more serious and focused on providing “material support for terrorism.”
These accusations, however, have been supported by shaky evidence at best. In order to support allegations that Mehanna provided this support, prosecutors have drawn upon the wealth of Islamic legal texts that Mehanna translated suggesting that Mehanna’s translations were used by “terrorists” to justify their actions. Mehanna is an avid scholar and translator of medieval Islamic legal thought; as a translator, he is not responsible for who reads his translations and what is done with them. Independent translation is not material support for terrorism by any stretch. In order to be considered material support under this law, Mehanna would have had to translate under the direct order of a designated foreign terrorist organization. He was once approached by Al-Qaeda to help translate a document, a fact about which that the prosecution is very vocal; what the prosecution fails to mention is that Mehanna never translated said document. If you do not translate something, Mehanna’s defense counsel argues, is that the same as if you did?
Why then is Mehanna being prosecuted? The FBI has been clear about this from the beginning. From 2005 to 2008, the FBI hounded Mehanna and pressured him to become an informant, a period during which they spied on him and his friends. They explained to Mehanna’s attorney in a 2008 telephone interview, "If your client does not collaborate with us, we will make his life a living hell." When one of Mehanna’s friends buckled under FBI pressure in 2009 and became an informant, Mehanna was arrested again.
The trial has been underway now for about three weeks, during which the prosecution has repeatedly shown the court unrelated videos of the September 11th attacks and footage of American military convoys in Iraq being blown up. Their intent is clear: disagreeing with American policies and advocating for Muslims to fight against the US military’s violent occupation of Muslim countries is terrorism. This trial threatens to establish a chilling precedent for civil liberties within the Muslim community as well as within America at large. It is in the interest of our freedom that we must support Tarek Mehanna.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As you pick up your tickets and pack your bags for this year’s Harvard-Yale game, keep in mind that our rival school may have a losing football team, but in terms of bringing its school accountable to gender equality, its students are doing a really admirable job.
Last March, a group of 16 students and alumni filed a Title IX complaint to the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, stating that Yale failed to eliminate “hostile environment” for female students. Much of the complaint centered on the university’s response to incidents of sexual and verbal assault. Yale, they claimed, has not been adequately responding to large-scale misogynistic verbal acts against women—like when a fraternity demonstrated in front of the Women’s Center with posters saying “We Love Yale Sluts” or a group of pledges paraded through the school shouting “No Means Yes! Yes Means Anal!”
They also asserted that the University was not providing an adequate response to students who had been harassed and assaulted. According to the New York Times, one incident in the complaint involves a student who was discouraged from talking to the police after she brought her case to the Sexual Harassment Grievance Board. “I know far too many stories about women who have been raped or harassed on this campus and no action has been taken,” Alexandra Brodsky, Yale ’12 and one of the signatories on the complaint, told me on the phone. The OCR is currently investigating the complaint.
How has this been received? For one, the complaint and its investigation has brought to the open subjects of sex, sexism and sexual assault—now consistently talked about on campus. “The existence of the conversation is a positive thing,” Brodsky said. In these conversations, “The term feminism is wielded often by name,” Sam Huber, an editor at Yale’s feminist magazine Broad Recognition, told me. “It’s the reverse of the national trend—‘is feminism dead?’—as it is portrayed in any national newspaper.”
There have been a few concrete changes as well. Among them, the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, designed to address allegations of sexual misconduct of every kind, began operating in July, according to Yale representative Thomas Conroy.
And the University itself has examined its own position towards women: Last week Yale released its own findings on the University’s sexual climate. The report—which you can read entirely online—contains several good suggestions, such as making clearer the process by which sexual assault is treated. But the report also puts some of the cause of sexual assault on campus down to the sexual climate to begin with, often appearing to conflate a “hook-up culture” with a sexual environment that is inherently hostile. “Anyone, of course, can agree or disagree with the committee's observations and conclusions, or offer their own ideas as to the causes of sexual misconduct,” Conroy wrote to me in an email.
The signatories of the complaint—who have devoted time and energy into holding their school accountable for its actions and who have been willing to speak publically about what they perceive to be an injustice on campus—deserve our full support. Theirs is an admirable model of feminist activity on campus—one that is willing to stand up for equality in all spheres of life and even in the face of potential backlash.
A few notes on Title IX: Yale students are hardly the only group to have filed a complaint to the Department of Education. Last year, complaints were filed against Princeton, University of Virginia and Duke (where there were at least three cases), all around the issues of colleges’ responses to sexual harassment and assault. There’s even been a complaint filed against Harvard Law School, citing HLS’s drawn-out process to accusations of assault as a violation of Title IX. In April, Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced a strict set of guidelines about how universities should deal with assault on campus and clarifying the standards set by Title IX.
These claims are important: Title IX is a powerful tool for holding schools accountable to the law, and one that all students should fully understand. The educational amendment of 1972 prohibits “discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” At Harvard in 2002, a complaint filed by lawyer and New England Law School Professor Wendy J. Murphy resulted in the end of a policy that required “corroborating evidence” before the Ad Board would investigate any assault dispute. Here, the OCR did not find Harvard to be in violation with Title IX, but the University had begun revising its policy while the investigation was underway.
As we consider what kind of institution we want our school to be, it is worth considering how existing laws already provide checks to a University’s action. In this, the Yale students who have stood up for gender equality are a good example to follow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since its inception as an ad campaign sponsored by Adbusters—the Canadian import that brought us T.V. Turnoff Week—Occupy Wall Street has seldom received criticism that it doesn’t deserve. Granted, the endless caviling about its muddled messaging is specious: This ahistorical and irrelevant concern for ideological clarity fails to account for the success of similarly “incoherent” protest movements like the Tea Party and, well, just about every successful protest in recorded history. Likewise, while “Eat the Rich” protest signs ostensibly vindicate Republicans’ class-war phobia, the reality of historically low taxes, unprecedented corporate profits, an ongoing stock market rebound, and a widening chasm between the haves and haves-not renders this paranoia risible.
Nevertheless, the clownish antics of the protesters, with their “Up Twinkles,” “Down Twinkles,” and misguided romanticization of their Vietnam-era countercultural forebears, makes it needlessly difficult to sympathize with them. They have somehow forgotten how the antiwar protests of the late 1960s and early 1970s provoked a counterrevolutionary backlash that begat 40 years of conservative cultural and political hegemony. And by roughing it in Harvard Yard—the epicenter of Ivy League liberalism—the Occupiers have even managed to polarize a community that had been otherwise largely well-disposed toward its cause.
It’s hardly surprising that they have alienated so many of those who agree with them; in my experience, protesters in general tend to be insufferably moralistic, woefully uninformed, frighteningly unhinged, or some unholy synthesis of the three. However, without them there is little standing in the way between democracy and oligarchy; the easily-manipulated voter alone is an insufficient safeguard. Thus, I grudgingly have to admit that, like all protest movements, Occupy Wall Street is a necessary evil. But it is an especially necessary evil in light of present circumstances, for the Occupiers have played and continue to play an additional function—operating as a counterweight to the Tea Party.
Beginning in January 2009, the Republican Party and indeed the nation at large underwent a violent, rightward lurch that stranded former conservatives like Bush speechwriter David J. Frum, Reagan adviser Bruce R. Bartlett, and blogger Andrew M. Sullivan in ideological limbo and pushed respectable, Republican policy innovations like cap and trade and the individual health insurance mandate to the leftmost extreme of the political spectrum. Ideas once considered anathema are now orthodoxy, and those once considered orthodoxy are now anathema.
The party of serial tax-hiker Ronald Reagan now will not raise revenues even in exchange for spending cuts of ten times the magnitude. Reagan once described the consequences of a failure to raise the debt ceiling as “impossible to predict and awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of the United States would have substantial effects on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such a result. The risks, the cost, the disruptions, and the incalculable damage lead me to but one conclusion: the Senate must pass this legislation before the Congress adjourns.” Many in his party now not only doubt the severity of default but also in fact embrace it as an easy way to balance the budget overnight. Capping carbon emissions was a part of the McCain-Palin campaign platform in 2008; climate change is now widely acknowledged to be a hoax. Mitt Romney—who since 2008 has somersaulted his way even further to the right—was not too long ago the conservative alternative to John McCain; he is now the voice of reason and moderation in the race.
Since September, however, things have started to change. We have begun the process of shifting the center back onto more traditional terrain. The Republican Party is demonstrating increasing willingness to come back down to Earth; Republican members of Congress’ Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, for example, have proposed $250 billion in revenue increases and are indicating that they might just be amenable to even more than that. Most encouraging, however, is that the entire national conversation has shifted from the pursuit of ill-advised, short-term austerity to combating rampant income inequality.
What all of this demonstrates is that in at least one very significant respect, we live in a very different country from the one that produced Richard Nixon’s “Silent Majority.” The 2010 midterm election proved that today’s America is one in which a foaming-at-the-mouth, populist rabble is fully capable of imposing its electoral will upon the body politic—something that the hippies could never manage. Now, the side that monopolizes the crazy is the side that wins. Thanks to Occupy Wall Street, at least it’s a fair fight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated: 7:05 a.m.
Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and running mate Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 will lead the Undergraduate Council next year, the UC Election Commission announced Thursday night after a relatively quiet race dominated by two insider tickets with strong records of leadership on the Council.
Voter turnout was significantly lower than in previous years’ elections, with participation down 865 votes from the 3,595 ballots filed in the 2010 race.
Bicknell and Yalamanchi received first-place votes on about 56 percent of the 2730 cast ballots. Given this clear majority, the pair won the election in the first round, and no redistribution of second- and third-place votes according to the Council’s instant-runoff voting system was necessary.
Crystal D. Trejo ’13 and David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13—an inactive Crimson news writer—claimed second place, trailing the victors by a margin of 592 votes. Running on a promise to abolish the UC when they graduate in May, Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and running mate Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 won the remaining 282 votes.
For the two leading tickets, many of the major themes of previous years’ platforms—including social space and increased dialogue between students and administrators—dominated the discussion. Both groups focused on offering attainable goals, with Bicknell-Yalamanchi promising a “realistic platform” and the Trejo-LeBoeuf ticket running on a slogan of “real action.”
But over the course of the two-week campaign, momentum shifted toward the Bicknell-Yalamanchi ticket as they began to capture a clear majority of student group endorsements. With the support of 25 organizations, the duo garnered endorsements from large student groups including the Harvard College Democrats, Radcliffe Union of Students, Queer Students and Allies, and the Environmental Action Committee. This more than doubled the 11 endorsements gathered by Trejo and LeBoeuf, which included the Harvard Republican Club and Harvard Organization for Latin America.
Bicknell attributed much of the ticket’s success in winning student group endorsements to their experience as UC leaders, realistic platform, and collaboration with student leaders in formulating their ideas.
According to Harvard College Democrats President Jonathan L. Newmark ’12, Bicknell and Yalamanchi’s focus on creating attainable goals—including changes to student group funding policies—secured the group’s endorsement.
“Danny and Pratyusha were the natural choice for the Dems because they brought ideas to the table that catered specifically to our needs,” Newmark said.
In addition to student group endorsements, Bicknell and Yalamanchi successfully gained a majority of support within the Undergraduate Council, particularly among freshmen council members—with nine of the 12 freshmen committing to their campaign.
“Our campaign strategy was geared largely toward freshmen because the reforms that are enacted will affect them the most,” said Phillip J. Morris ’12, one of the campaign managers for the Bicknell-Yalamanchi ticket. “Seniors won’t be around to experience the changes that are promised, so they typically don’t care as much.”
Morris added that Bicknell and Yalamanchi’s long tenure as UC leaders—both have served since their freshman years—appealed to Council members and student group leaders.
“At the end of the day, I think experience is what set the tickets apart, and it showed in the solutions and proposals that were set forth,” said Morris. “Danny’s experience with advocacy and Pratyusha’s experience with finance served as a powerful combination that helped win over both student groups and Council members.”
At an election results party last night, Bicknell and Yalamanchi expressed their excitement to begin working to implement their campaign promises.
“We were motivated to run to make a difference,” Bicknell said. “We will be working every single minute until the end of our presidency to advocate for students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since roughly 350 protestors descended on Harvard Yard last Wednesday, campus has been abuzz with casual conversation about the “Occupy Harvard” movement—which has set up a tent city in front of the John Harvard statue. But undergraduates found an official forum to discuss the movement’s effectiveness and long term goals on Thursday night at the Institute of Politics.
The Harvard Political Union hosted “Occupy Harvard: A Student Discussion,” a lively debate during which undergraduates expressed mixed views on Occupy Harvard and its connection to the broader “Occupy” movement.
The event, hosted by Institute of Politics Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, featured a panel of students both in favor of and opposed to the protest.
The panel included Crimson editor and Occupy Harvard organizer Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, Occupy Harvard supporter Dylan R. Matthews ’12, Harvard Political Review Editor-in-Chief Max D. Novendstern ’12, Crimson editorial writer Evan A. Ribot ’14, Institute of Politics President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12, and Student Labor Action Movement leader William P. Whitham ’14.
At the forum’s opening, Korn defended the validity of Occupy Harvard and its aims, citing the contract recently won by Harvard custodial workers as one success of the student rallies.
“We are demanding that the custodians get a fair contract with the University,” Korn said. “The fact that there was a large student presence and press coverage in that issue was something that did contribute to the custodians getting a good contract.”
Other panelists said that Occupy Harvard has failed to muster a significant amount of student support for a number of reasons.
Novendstern claimed that the movement has morphed into a “slam campaign” against the University, rather than one that unites students behind inspiring ideals.
“It’s not this broadly inclusive social movement,”  Novendstern said. “It struck me more as a specific, special interests campaign. It’s much harder for young progressives to sign onto that.”
Ribot said that he believes that the movement’s most serious flaw lies in its lack of communication with the student body.
“I find that the ways Occupy Harvard protestors were going about stating grievances and their implementation was misguided,” Ribot said.
He also said that by joining the Occupy movement, students have closed themselves off from opportunities to effect change by working within the system.
When the discussion was opened up to comment from audience members, students in attendance both criticized and praised the demonstration.
While some were openly supportive of the efforts of protestors, others said that they were deterred by the little information on the movement’s goals and future plans they had received.
Whitham responded by pointing out ways interested students could learn more about Occupy Harvard.
“If you go to the info tent, if you come ask us, or if you go on our website, you’ll find out pretty quickly the issues we’re interested in,” he said.
But many agreed that the movement has succeeded in sparking thought-provoking conversations throughout the Harvard community.
“One of the great virtues of the campaign is that it scandalized the campus,” Novendstern said. “If anything, that was the resounding success of the movement.”

After months of uncertainty, Bob Slate Stationary, a longtime Harvard Square institution, re-opened in its new location Thursday at 30 Brattle St.
“I’m a looking forward to being a small business owner in the Square and contributing to its quirkiness, breadth of opportunity, and great customer service,” said new owner Laura E. Donohue ’85 outside of the store, surrounded by co-workers and family, community members, and customers.
Donohue purchased the company last spring from the previous owners, Mallory and Justin Slate, and has since been working to reopen the store.
After securing a new location, purchasing furniture, restocking the shelves, and installing other needed items for the store, Donohue held a soft opening in October.
“It’s been several whirlwind months, but we’re back,” Donohue said.
Donohue attributed the success of the official opening to support from her family and the Cambridge community. Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher and Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis, a longtime friend of Donohue, attended the event.
“This a good day in Cambridge and a great day to celebrate what Harvard Square is about,” Maher said. “I believe it’s really important to support businesses like Bob Slate. It’s great to see an independent business with local employees.”
In the presence of the Slate brothers, Donohue pledged to uphold the store to the best of her ability. She thanked them for their support in the opening process.
Meghana Agni, a post-baccalaureate student at the Harvard Health Careers program, was eating lunch across the street when she heard clapping and came over to see what was happening.
“I’ve been waiting for it to open ever since it was bought. I’m very loyal to Bob Slate. I haven’t used a notebook for my classes all semester because I’m stubborn and only use a certain one from Bob Slate,” Agni said.
Agni could not find the specific notebook she was looking for, but she requested the item at the opening. Donohue said she would order in-demand products that were formerly carried in the store to satisfy old customers.
Donohue said she wished she had had more time to plan for the event but wanted to officially open in the wake of the holiday season.
“I think I did everything wrong according to business school, but it’s okay because we’re still here and we’re making it work,” Donohue said.
Donohue plans to extend the store’s hours for the next four weeks due to the holiday.
She concluded her opening speech by thanking the founder and namesake of the store, Mallory and Justin’s father.
“I hope Bob himself is looking down from the great warehouse in the sky and is pleased that his name has lived on,” Donohue said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is growing yet again—with 220 new sophomores, SEAS saw a 62 percent increase in total concentrators this week, according to tentative data provided by the school.
The increase also marks a 25 percent jump from the 175 juniors who declared as SEAS concentrators last fall.
“The growth is fantastic,” said David A. Weitz, professor of applied physics. “I know that SEAS is working hard to attract people.”
All five concentrations offered by the school—applied mathematics, biomedical engineering, computer science, and engineering sciences AB and SB—have seen an increase in the number of concentrators since last year. SEAS’ 576 concentrators represent approximately 12 percent of the undergraduate population, according to SEAS’s preliminary data.
Biomedical engineering, which was first offered last fall, experienced the biggest jump—38 percent—between the number of sophomore and junior concentrators.
Professors said that growth at SEAS mirrors trends across the nation.
“The economic climate is such that perhaps people are seeing engineering as an option that is likely to lead to a good career,” said computer science professor J. Gregory Morrisett.
SEAS has made a conscious effort to bolster freshman advising and its web presence, according to Harry R. Lewis ’68, computer science professor and former dean of the College. But professors also credited the strength of introductory courses with pulling students into SEAS.
“In my mind David Malan and CS50 are a huge part of the growth in CS in particular,” said computer science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83. “The way that David has made CS50 both relevant and fun and approachable for a large segment of people has gotten a lot more people to consider doing computer science.”
Ali A. Farag ’14, who declared the bachelor of arts track of engineering sciences, said that Engineering Sciences 51: Computer-Aided Machine Design, and its final project—designing and building an all terrain vehicle—significantly contributed to his concentration decision.
But as SEAS’ numbers rise, maintaining faculty-student ratios and adequate resources is an important priority.
“The challenge is, how do we scale good teaching and learning when these classes get so big?” explained Morrisett.
“We can’t certainly increase the faculty by 20 percent,” said Eric Mazur, area dean for applied physics, adding that professors will need to work harder to accommodate more students.
Maria E. Bendana ’14, who plans to get a bachelor of sciences degree in engineering, said that attending a more focused engineering institution would have offered her a broader palette of courses.
“It’s a little bit disappointing,” she said. “At the same time, I know SEAS is brand new.”
But Morrisett noted that as a liberal arts institution, the University is in a unique position to promote “21st century engineering,” an increasingly interdisciplinary arena.
Rapidly expanding connections between engineering and the humanities—through social networking and online advertising, for example—are expanding engineering’s reach, he said.
“I think we’re at a really interesting point ... Engineering and humanities [are] poised to really take off,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew Sullivan, a political commentator and blogger for The Daily Beast, discussed what he sees as the perversion of conservatism in mainstream politics in a lecture at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
“I think it is not controversial to say it is in some sort of crisis,” Sullivan said of American conservatism in the annual Theodore H. White Lecture on press and politics.
Sullivan, who is a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School and also holds a Ph.D. in government from Harvard, criticized the Republican Party for not representing true conservative ideas. He explained his more philosophical definition of conservatism, which focuses on the problems of the human condition and questions government’s ability to adequately address them.
“The state is a danger, a danger because a few people can get a hold of it and just a few ideas can wreck the subtle, beautiful lives of many,” he said.
He also pointed out the possible harmful effects of large corporations and bankers, as, like government, they can represent the accumulation and concentration of power.
Sullivan noted the discrepancy between the conservatism he studied at the Kennedy School and the modern perception of conservatism.
“The conservatism I speak of seems unrecognizable to the students of today,” he said, going on to explain that he considers  President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton better proponents of conservative values than George W. Bush.
Sullivan identified two current issues—the debt crisis and the on-going tension between Israel and Iran—as examples of the necessity of this type of conservatism today.
Although they expressed doubt regarding some of Sullivan’s ideas, many audience members said they found Sullivan’s view of conservatism interesting and more appealing than the mainstream definition.
“All concerned college students who care about their political society or world politics should hear his view of conservatism,” said Ibrahim A. Khan ’14.
Ben S. Raderstorf ’14 said that Sullivan’s ideas represented a more rational view of conservatism.
“Even though I personally disagree on some of the fundamental questions, I think that his viewpoints are very solid and very respectable,” Raderstorf said.
Ending with a comparison of modern America to the biblical Tower of Babel, Sullivan claimed that greed is responsible for many of America’s problems and is not likely to go away soon. Yet, Sullivan expressed some optimism for America.
“Reason will win in the end. If I did not believe that, I would not believe in liberal democracy.”

For the first five minutes after learning of his victory in the race for the Undergraduate Council presidency, Danny P. Bicknell ’13 stood speechless in the center of his Mather common room, surrounded by a crowd of supporters chanting, “DP, DP, DP,” drowning out the traditional Harvard Glee Club serenade.
With her running mate lost for words, UC vice-president-elect Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 stepped in.
“When we first started running,[current UC president Senan Ebrahim ’12] told us that by the end, one of us would be crying as the other stood by for support,” Yalamanchi said.
“Senan thought that it would be me,” she added.
Only with the arrival of his younger brother David Bicknell ’15 did the president-elect break out of his shock to address his friends and campaign staff.
“You guys have been literally the most amazing people I have ever worked with,” Bicknell said.
Several minutes later, a knock on the door interrupted the party, and the crowd fell silent as Bicknell’s floor tutor Jonathan Darrow entered.
“I know Danny just won the UC elections and a little bit of celebration is required,” Darrow said.
“But actually a lot of celebration is in order,” he added, popping open a bottle of champagne and spraying the newly elected leaders.
The party for competitors Crystal D. Trejo ’13 and David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13, which relocated at the last minute to a Winthrop common room, was a more subdued affair.
After sharing the results, Trejo and LeBoeuf addressed the dozen friends and campaign staff who had gathered to await the news.
“I don’t think that I’ve ever had such an exciting two weeks,” Trejo said.
LeBoeuf, who currently serves as the UC Rules Committee Chair, emphasized his continued commitment to the Council.
“Remember guys, the campaign doesn’t end here,” he said. “We’ve started something great.”
With the two leading tickets hosting parties for campaign staff and friends, third-place ticket Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 opted to attend the Harvard-Yale pep rally that took place Thursday evening in the Queen’s Head Pub instead of hosting their own festivities.
Staff members for both the Bicknell-Yalamanchi and Trejo-LeBoeuf tickets expressed their happiness with the campaign as they celebrated the end of a strenuous two weeks.
“It could be worse. The third ticket could’ve won.” Trejo-LeBoeuf supporter Kevin Garcia ’14 said.
“Or Occupy could’ve won,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No more camera flashes in front of the John Harvard Statue. No more questions about the visitors center. No more crowds blocking the way to class. Since Nov. 9, the tourists of Harvard have been locked out of the Yard.
Replacing the daily hordes of visitors, student protestors have pitched a small tent city in front of University Hall. They are occupying Harvard Yard.
Yet these bold few—there are rarely more than 20 or so in the tents representing “Occupy Harvard”—have elicited a significant reaction from the Harvard University Police Department, which has quartered the Yard off and allows access only to students.
And the campus feels different. With HUPD officers no longer allowing casual visitors to enter America’s most selective university, students say that losing the daily flow of tourists has stripped the Yard of its identity as a bustling center. And for the occupiers, who say the administration’s security response is trying to turn the students against the protestors, the loss of the Yard’s most prevalent passers-by hurts their message.
A TENT CITY IN AN EMPTY YARD
For the past week and a half, students have strolled through an uncannily deserted Harvard Yard.
“The Yard feels empty now with out them,” says Connie S. Zhong ’14, who notes the absence of the large crowds that used to surround the John Harvard Statue and were led by “screaming tour guides.”
“It made Harvard, Harvard, having them around,” she adds.
While the increased security has altered the campus’ feel and frustrated some tourists, most are understanding of the University’s response.
For Alvaro Gomez, a high school senior visiting with his classmates from southern Texas, the increased security was an example of the University’s commitment to protecting its undergraduates.
“[Harvard] is secure for us students,” Gomez said.
But occupiers question whether the administration might be overreacting.
“Harvard campus is open to thousands of tourist daily, and, if there were concrete evidences of threats, I’d feel more understanding,” says Helen M. Stevens ’11, who is participating in the Occupy movement. “The tourists aren’t a threat to Harvard.”
John S. Dwyer, another member of the Occupy Harvard movement and a student at the Harvard Extension School, believes the University may be acting unfairly with the policy­—in an effort to cast a negative light on the protest.
“From my time at Occupy Boston, I’m aware of the safety concerns,” Dwyer says. “But I am also aware the University might be using this to turn the people against us.”
‘NO ENTRY’ ALLOWED
Many tourists still expectantly march to the gates of Harvard—only to find them locked to outside visitors. These tourists often have not heard of the Occupy Harvard movement and are confused when HUPD officers turn them away.
Samiah Hassan, a tourist, says that she was surprised by the security in place.
“Not everyone is a threat or a menace,” Hassan says.
Hassan added that she would prefer if the University only restricted smaller areas in the yard.
She is only one of many tourists. According to University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall, an average of 30,000 visitors participate in Harvard’s official tours each year. Currently, the University has stopped all tours.
“Given security precautions the University has put in place, the Harvard Information Office has suspended daily public tours,” Marshall wrote in an emailed statement. “However, a few previously scheduled groups are being accommodated with an abbreviated tour that does not require access to Harvard Yard.”
Since tours are no longer allowed into the yard, high school students like Gomez and his classmates from Texas cannot see the complete picture of what life might be like for them as freshmen at Harvard.
“I enjoyed [my visit], but I would be satisfied if we could enter,” Gomez says. “I don’t believe [the increased security is] not fair because they need to be cautious, but we all really wanted to enter.”
‘AS MANY YEARS AS NECESSARY’
Current students, while enjoying the freer Yard, do sympathize with the turned-away tourists.
“They travelled a long way to get here, and they didn’t have advanced notice the yard would be shut down,” Margaret L. Flatt ’12 says.
The University remains vague on its long-term plans with respect to the protestors, and some students have begun discussing when the occupiers will desert the Yard.
Neither Dywer nor Stevens is certain how long the protests will continue.
According to Dwyer, protestors might stay in the Yard to show support for the Occupy Boston movement, even if the demands of the Occupy Harvard movement are met. The movement’s demands range from bridging the alleged 180:1 income ratio gap between Harvard Management Company executives and custodial staff to stopping the University’s investments in what the protestors see as irresponsible funds that are allegedly funding land grabbing in Africa.
The occupiers, Dwyer says, are committed to continuing the protests for “as many years as necessary.”

After a long bout with lymphoma, Paul R. Epstein, instructor in medicine and associate director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard Medical School, died at the age of 67 at his home in Boston on Sunday.
A pioneer in the field of global environmental research, Epstein tackled problems ranging from the causes of epidemics to the intersection of global warming and health.
“He was one of an early handful of public health-oriented physicians who started pointing out the impact of climate change on infectious and parasitic diseases,” his former colleague, Boston University Professor of Environmental Health Richard W. Clapp, wrote in an email.
In 1992, Epstein published a report linking the cholera epidemic in Peru to algal blooms caused by warming sea surface temperatures.
This past year, Epstein co-authored “Changing Planet, Changing Health,” a book that outlines possible solutions for rethinking the global economy and its impact on health.
Epstein’s work carried him to far corners of the globe. His work abroad included rebuilding Mozambique’s healthcare system and participating in the 1997 summit in Japan that resulted in the Kyoto Protocol.
“He was a charismatic and compassionate person who was completely comfortable in any setting from a poor African village to corridors of great power in Washington, D.C.,” said Professor James McCarthy, who co-taught an undergraduate junior tutorial with Epstein for 15 years.
McCarthy said that he always looked forward to Epstein’s lectures that “stretched across a long blackboard” in their classroom in each year. “I know of many Harvard College students whose career directions were profoundly altered by their experience in this course,” McCarthy said.
Throughout his career, Epstein combined practicing with writing and teaching. He served on an advisory committee comprised of scientists from top universities and centers throughout the world that advise the Scientists and Evangelicals Initiative, which educates pastors on the effects of climate change.
Epstein also worked with the National Academy of Sciences, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.
“[Epstein’s] greatest asset was his deep sense of moral purpose and desire to make a positive contribution in the world,” Clapp said.

On the night before thousands of Harvard students will journey down to New Haven for the annual Harvard-Yale football game, the College Events Board organized a pep rally to fire up the student body. But oversights and natural obstacles kept the event from going off without a hitch.
For starters, the evening’s special guests—the Harvard football team—did not show.
Approximately 400 students gathered in the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub to enjoy free clam chowder and hot chocolate while they watched performances from various student groups, leading up to an opportunity to “cheer on the football team,” according to a pre-circulated announcement from organizers.
But to the dismay of many rally-goers, the team did not make its planned appearance.
When Master of Ceremonies Peter D. Davis ’12 announced that the team would not be appearing, many of the attendees promptly left the Pub.
“It’s a little disappointing that the football team didn’t show up for its own pep rally,” said Mariam Braimah ’13, one of the two disc jockeys at the event. “But it was as good as it could be given the circumstances.”
The football team’s absence was not intentional, according to a team member.
“It was a true mistake,” running back Treavor Scales ’13 said. “We felt really bad.”
Scales explained that the team holds a weekly dinner on Thursday evenings, and this week’s dinner, which featured speeches by senior players, ran later into the night than usual, causing the team to miss the rally.
“We had our senior speeches, and they got a little emotional and ran longer than expected,” Scales said.
The inclement weather posed additional problems for rally organizers and drove the festivities indoors into the Pub from Harvard Yard as slated.
The move sent the CEB scrambling to reorganize the event. The difference in stage sizes between venues posed a significant problem for organizers, according to CEB member Michelle Luo ’14. The outdoor stage, on the steps of Memorial Church, is about four times larger than the Pub’s stage.
The cheerleading team was most affected by the change of venue and had to alter its routine drastically.
“Outside is better for us, because we have more space to do crowd-pleasing stunts,” Captain Allyson McGinty ’13 said. “It’s harder for the crowd to be unified because of the way the space is laid out.”
Davis—who hosted the event, joking throughout the evening in between acts—made light of the poor weather during a free moment off-stage.
“Harvard only celebrates football once a year,” Davis said. “It’s good that they got this moment in the sun—well, not in the sun.”
Even with the cramped space and the football team’s absence, many students seemed to enjoy the rally.
“I’m having a good time,” said Aleja A. Jimenez-Jaramillo ’15, who proudly wore a spandex “Crim the Crimson” mascot body suit. “I’m having a hard time closing my mouth in this costume, but other than that I’m fine.”
The Office of Student Life intended for the pep rally to be the culmination of H-Week, a series of events aiming to inspire school spirit.
“We wanted to make sure that as many undergrads as possible had as much fun as possible,” said Kenneth A. Parreno ’11, a fellow for student life at the Office of Student Life.  “It’s a time of year when Harvard students, across houses and across years, can come together whether they’re football fans or not.”

Harvard Law School Professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr. predicted Obama will not emphasize race in the 2012 election at his lecture “Understanding Obama: The Conundrum of Race.”
However, he argued that race will continue to play a major role in politics.
“I’m convinced that we won’t become post-racial,” Ogletree said.
According to Ogletree, Obama has fostered diversity in the federal government through his appointments, noting his selection of Sonia M. Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice, and of Eric H. Holder, Jr., the first black attorney general.
The lecture was Ogletree’s third and final presentation in this year’s Nathan I. Huggins Lecture Series.
Jamal H. Khan, a second year student at Harvard Law School, attended the first and third lectures in the series, and said that he thought the first lecture was more interesting because it focused more on Obama’s past.
Khan said he felt it was too early to analyze the recent decisions of the Obama administration or to reflect on the president’s growth and development.
Ogletree also discussed Obama’s prospects for the 2012 presidential election, noting that Obama currently fares well in polls against all declared Republican candidates, but poorly when pitted against a generic Republican candidate.
The fate of Obama’s healthcare legislation could have a bearing on the outcome of the election, Ogletree said, which he predicted the Supreme Court would not strike down when it rules on the bill in March.

Kegs and U-Hauls, banned at Harvard tailgates, will reappear in New Haven this weekend as House Committees navigate the discrepancies between Harvard and Yale’s tailgating policies.
Although Harvard students have come to expect laxer tailgating rules in New Haven, Lowell HoCo Co-Chair Margaret E. Soutter ‘12 said that Yale’s new regulations have limited the House’s plans for the Game.
“Especially since it’s not the home game this year, there is a lot of red tape you have to go through when you want to bring all this extra stuff,” Soutter said.
Because they receive their funds from Harvard, House Committees are forced to follow Harvard’s policy, which only allows beer and wine, even though Yale’s policy does not explicitly ban hard alcohol, according to Soutter.
When Harvard regulations prevented House Committees from serving hard alcohol and using kegs at last year’s tailgates, Lowell spent extra money to serve bottled beers instead.
This year, Yale’s ban on glass bottles will force Lowell to purchase kegs and canned beers, Soutter said.
The ban on glass bottles is part of a number of new tailgate guidelines released by Yale this past September.
Under the new rules, tailgate attendees are required to show IDs and wear wristbands attesting to their legal drinking age before they can be served alcohol.
This past Sunday, Yale College Council of Masters Chair Frank Keil told the Yale Daily News that residential college tailgates would be prohibited from serving alcohol at this year’s game. Monday evening, Yale administrators reversed their decision and announced that they were lifting the ban, allowing alcohol to be served to students age 21 and over.
House Committees have not let Yale’s slightly stricter rules stop them from planning creative activities for the thousands of students and alumni who will be in attendance.
Pfozheimer House will serve gallons of chili made from a student recipe, Dunster House will pass out leis and punch at its luau-themed tailgate, and Mather House’s “Crunk Clock” will announce every fifteen minutes that it is “Crunk Time.”
While “Crunk Time” has at past tailgates indicated that those present should drink, Mather HoCo Chair Andrew F. Iannone ’12 wrote in an email that this year it will be “more of a time to announce Mather’s presence” by blowing whistles and shouting Mather House chants.
Unlike Harvard, where administrators mandated that all tailgating activities end before kickoff, Yale does not require tailgates to shut down until the third quarter, which House Committee chairs called more conducive to a social atmosphere.
“I think, from what I hear, that people are going to be much more festive and merrier down there. People are excited to go down,” said incoming Kirkland HoCo Co-Chair Cynthia Wu ’13, who is also an inactive Crimson photography editor. “Go Kirkland, and go Harvard.”

Anita Hill, a professor of social policy, law, and women’s studies at Brandeis University, urged Americans to closely examine social inequality and work to increase access to the “American Dream” in a lecture Thursday at the Radcliffe Institute.
“Ultimately, as we deal with income inequality in the country, more and more people are locked out,” said Hill.
Hill—who rose to public prominence in 1991 when she accused Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment as he was being vetted for the Supreme Court—recently published “Reimagining Inequality,” a book using the American home as a lens to examine gender and racial inequality in the United States.
“Equality has to be a lived experience, and nothing speaks to that more than the place we call home,” she said.
Hill discussed the evolution of the home over the course of American history, focusing on how the ideal of the suburban dream home has become increasingly exclusionary.
The contemporary conception of the ideal home is “now out of reach of most Americans,” Hill said.
Hill highlighted how structural inequality manifests in housing, using the recent subprime mortgage crisis as an example. She said that “lingering racism and discrimination” caused African-Americans and women to be disproportionately impacted by the downturn.
Hill said that when researching her book, she focused on the conditions of inequality rather than progress toward equality, a decision which gave her a new “perspective on systemic discrimination.”
In the past, Hill has received much attention for the accusations she levied against Thomas during his confirmation hearings, but she said from the get-go that her lecture would “not [be] a talk about the hearings.”
Nevertheless, the first question from the audience was about the high-profile case, which ultimately cleared Thomas of the sexual harassment charges. A woman in attendance stood up and asked Hill if she would accept a position on the Supreme Court.
“Wouldn’t that be awkward?” Hill responded, a comment which earned laughter from the audience. “I really do like the things I’m doing in my life right now,” she said.
At the end of her speech, Hill encouraged audience members to be watchful for opportunities to extend the “American Dream” to all Americans.
“I was really provoked by the notion of needing to bring equality to individuals,” said Reginald A. Wilson, an attendee, who said that Hill was “asking us to do something radical.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since he arrived in Cambridge as a multi-talented recruit four years ago, Harvard middle linebacker Alex Gedeon has done everything his coaches and teammates have asked of him.
On and off the field, the senior has met every challenge he’s been faced with head-on —and sometimes even foot-on.
The latter undertaking came before a November game against Columbia last year, when Crimson head coach Tim Murphy called on the linebacker to fill in as an emergency punter after sophomore Jacob Dombrowski was involved in a car accident the previous night.
“The day before the game, we had a walkthrough on the field,” Gedeon recalls. “I was just kind of kicking the ball around, telling [special teams] coach [Tony] Reno I still had some punts in me.”
But all of a sudden, the linebacker was being asked to perform double-duty in an actual game.
Though special teams wasn’t exactly new to the senior—whose versatility had impressed Murphy when he was being recruited—the 6’2, 230 pounder had only expected one of his high school roles of quarterback, linebacker, and punter to come in handy at Harvard.
Yet when the telephone rang that Friday night, Gedeon accepted Reno’s challenge and gave special teams a try.
Surprising many of his teammates, the linebacker averaged 36.8 yards per attempt on that chilly November afternoon, topping both Lions punters. He even placed one inside the 20.
“It was one of those things where I hadn’t done it enough to put pressure on myself,” Gedeon says. “I wasn’t thinking of technique or anything. ... Once the nerves set in, I got off a couple of good ones.”
Though Gedeon found success in his new role, on the whole, the Hudson, Ohio native certainly made the right decision to focus on linebacker when he joined the Crimson in the fall of 2008.
After being named to the preseason All-Ivy League team this season, the senior has lived up to that billing and more. Gedeon’s 83 tackles lead Harvard by a wide margin, and he has not had fewer than seven tackles in any game this year.
The linebacker has also played a big role in helping Harvard achieve its league-high plus-seven turnover margin. In three midseason contests, Gedeon forced a fumble that resulted in a Crimson touchdown against Lafayette, had a key red-zone interception against Cornell, and had a win-sealing interception against Princeton.
“There aren’t enough words to describe how much he means to the team,” junior cornerback Brian Owusu says. “He knows football front and back, he’s a playmaker, he’s fast, he’s just one of those guys the whole team looks up to.”
Just as important as Gedeon’s play on the field has been his leadership off of it. A year ago, the senior’s teammates voted him Harvard football’s 138th captain, in part for the willingness to do whatever was best for the squad that he displayed against Columbia.
“Among a great senior class, he was the guy that almost everybody felt was the best guy to lead this team,” Murphy says. “His work ethic and his leadership by example are tremendous. He’ll do anything for this football team. He’s got the poise and confidence and personal qualities that you would want any captain to have.”
Perhaps most impressive was the rapidity with which Gedeon was able to earn his teammates’ admiration.
The linebacker barely played at all as a freshman and sophomore, as a number of injuries led to his recording just nine total tackles in 2008 and 2009 combined. But during those years, his coaches saw a determination and work ethic that they rewarded with a starting spot when Gedeon arrived in Cambridge for his junior season.
And the linebacker in turn paid back his coaches for that choice, establishing himself as one of the stars of the defense in a breakout year. He finished fourth on the team with 49 tackles—including a career-high 17 (with 1.5 sacks) against Yale—and ranked second on the squad with two interceptions, despite playing in just eight games.
“He’s just one of those guys that’s relentless in his pursuit of excellence, both on and off the field,” Murphy says. “That’s something you can’t coach—either you have it or you don’t.”
After that performance in 2010, Gedeon’s teammates knew he was the best man to lead them in 2011.
“It was really special,” Gedeon says of being named captain. “To be able to represent this group of men that has so many leaders and that is such close friends and has been through so much together, it was an honor.”
This season, Murphy couldn’t be more pleased with the job his middle linebacker has done leading the coach’s sixth Ivy League championship squad.
“We’ve had a lot of great captains here, but I don’t know if we’ve ever had a better captain than Alex Gedeon,” Murphy says. “He is the consummate student-athlete. He is an incredible leader, [he’s] humble, selfless, and a great player, one of the best linebackers in the country.”
Gedeon, for his part, has greatly enjoyed his time as captain.
“It’s probably been the best experience of my life,” he says.
Next year, the senior has already accepted a position at the Chicago branch of Bain Capital, a private-equity firm where he will work alongside classmate and Crimson cornerback Matthew Hanson.
“As I’ve moved through college, my interest in business and how to drive growth in businesses has grown,” Gedeon explains. “I think the work is going to be challenging and interesting.”
His coach has no doubt that Gedeon will succeed in his new endeavor, just as he did when he took on punting last year.
“He’s one of those guys that’s very goal-oriented,” Murphy says. “When he puts his mind to something, he’s going to do it.”
One thing’s for sure: at Harvard, Gedeon has already proven to be an asset with quite the return on investment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most football teams feature a go-to wide receiver, someone they can throw to when in need of a third-down conversion or a quick chunk of yardage. The squad’s quarterback will depend on this player to be open when he most needs him to be, a safety-net whom the quarterback can rely on to bail him out of trouble.
But when opposing quarterbacks face Harvard, there’s only one problem: they don’t have that option.
That’s because the Crimson secondary contains senior cornerback Matthew Hanson, who for the past four years has been shutting down opposing number one receivers on a weekly basis.
“For me, it’s all about confidence,” says Hanson, who leads the Ancient Eight with 10 pass breakups. “You have to be confident as a corner when you’re chasing a guy around the field.”
Take Cornell’s Kurt Ondash, who was leading the Ivy League in catches and yards when Hanson took him on one-on-one in week five. Though Big Red quaterback Jeff Mathews threw for 322 yards, only 16 of those—on just one reception—went to Ondash, who got lost on what the cornerback likes to call “Hanson Island” (he even has a T-Shirt with the phrase).
Then there’s Brown’s Alex Tounkara-Kone, a preseason first-team All-Ivy pick who recorded seven catches for 149 yards and two touchdowns week one against Stony Brook. But when Tounkara-Kone went up against Hanson seven days later, he finished with just three receptions for 19 yards.
“Every week he gets matched up with the best receiver on the opposing team,” captain Alex Gedeon explains. “And every week he’s covered receivers better than anybody in the league.”
The trend has remained consistent outside the Ancient Eight. For example, Holy Cross’ Gerald Mistretta, Lafayette’s Mark Ross, and Bucknell’s Frank DeNick rank third, fourth, and seventh in the Patriot League with 66.5, 64.0, and 50.8 receiving yards per game, respectively. But against Hanson, those three receivers collected just 44, 41, and 24 yards each.
“When he was a freshman, this is where I thought he would be [now],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “It’s not that he didn’t play well as a sophomore or a junior, but it seems like it all came together this year. Part of it is that he finally realized he’s better than anybody in this league. ... He gives us a dominant player at a very crucial position.”
Hanson was an immediate standout during his freshman season, starting from day one and winning Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors after recording a team-high four interceptions and six pass breakups for Harvard’s championship squad.
“I showed up at camp not expecting much,” Hanson recalls. “It was both cool and scary being thrown into the starting lineup, but I’m really glad it happened. It was a blast playing with those guys freshman year, and I learned a lot from it.”
Before his sophomore season, Hanson was named a preseason All-American, and teams began to avoid his side of the field. He thus didn’t have an interception, but still finished with seven pass breakups and was tabbed as a first-team All-Ivy honoree.
The cornerback followed that performance with a strong junior year, earning second-team All-Ivy honors after recording 41 tackles and seven passes defended with one interception.
But as a senior, Hanson has taken his game to a whole new level, consistently going mano-a-mano with receivers and getting a hand in on nearly every pass thrown his way.
“Matt’s been one of the biggest playmakers on our team,” junior cornerback Brian Owusu says. “Our coaches and players have extreme trust in him.”
Over the past year, the corner’s increased success has been due in part to the fact that he has begun to play more physically and to jam receivers at the line, forcing them to try to beat him.
“[Previously], even when we thought he could play tight man-to-man or tight zone, he was always a little reluctant to do that,” Murphy says. “I’m not sure he bought into the fact of how good he was.”
His coach is even willing to compare him to one of the best cornerbacks in the world.
“He plays out there like a dominator, like a Darrelle Revis relative to the NFL,” Murphy says. “He realizes what he can do, and it’s been kind of a revelation, I think. It’s just been such a huge boost to his confidence level, his leadership level, and his production level. ... He knows anyone he lines up against, he can play against.”
Things haven’t always come this easy for Hanson, who spent most of his pre-college years growing up in a single-parent household.
But despite the challenges that presented, Hanson continued to work hard on and off the field, becoming a multi-sport star in Lafayette, Colo., before arriving in Cambridge.
At Harvard, Hanson has had to manage his pre-med courseload while also picking up everything there is to observe about other teams’ wideouts during football season.
“You’ve got to study up on [receivers] and know them as well as they know themselves,” Hanson explains. “You need to at least have a clue of what he’s doing so you can defend him and be aggressive.”
But while the senior has been as successful at learning his opponents’ tendencies as anyone in the league, he’s also been a great teacher as well.
“He’s been pretty much the leader of our group,” Owusu says. “Just being able to learn from him and all the things he’s done on and off the field has been an inspiration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The offensive line was not initially a concern for Harvard coach Tim Murphy and the Crimson football team this season.
With several starters and other veteran players returning from last year’s squad, Harvard’s front line looked promising. But season-ending injuries and other serious setbacks raised concerns about this year’s offensive line.
“With all the guys that we had to replace, there was a lot of uncertainty coming into the season,” senior quarterback Collier Winters says. “We definitely asked a lot of those guys, and they’ve done more than what we expected.”
The team suffered its first setback when senior Ben Stabler was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 6’5, 300-pound lineman appeared in all 10 of Harvard’s games last year, starting the final five.
“[Stabler] would have been one of the top players in the Ivy League at his position this year,” Murphy says. “That was a very tough loss for us as a team, not only because he was such a good player and hard to replace, but when you consider the seriousness of his illness, it’s an emotional blow to the team.”
But Stabler’s fight has also motivated the entire football program.
“Ben comes by when he can,” Murphy says. “He’s with us on the sideline for every home game. His presence when he’s around is really a joy for a team.”
Junior tackle Matthew McCarthy was the next Crimson offensive lineman to go down.
Appearing in five games last year, McCarthy was expected to be a key part of the front line this year until he suffered a shoulder injury in the offseason which required surgery and has kept him on the sideline indefinitely.
McCarthy’s impact on the team was obvious both on and off the field.
“[McCarthy] is probably one of the most well-liked and respected guys on the team,” Murphy says. “He’s extremely tough, extremely committed, and has a super personality. He’s selfless, funny, and witty, yet understated. Everybody loves him.”
Murphy was confident that junior tackle Nick Scheidler, who appeared in just three games last year, would play an important role in McCarthy’s absence. But Scheidler’s season quickly came to an end when he suffered a severe concussion during Harvard’s preseason training camp.
“When you’ve just lost [McCarthy], you think Nick Scheidler can step up and do the job,” Murphy says. “Then we lose him in the offseason. We were in a little bit of a state of shock in the offensive line.”
Fortunately for the Crimson, several players have stepped in to fill the void.
Left tackle Kevin Murphy has become a stalwart in the trenches. The 6’7, 295-pound senior was tabbed a second-team All-Ivy League selection last year and a preseason All-Ivy League selection by Phil Steel’s College Football Preview this season. Tim Murphy says that Kevin Murphy may be the best Harvard lineman since Matt Birk ’98, an NFL Pro Bowler who now plays for the Baltimore Ravens.
But it may be Murphy’s contributions as a mentor that are most significant to the team. His leadership has helped the less-experienced Crimson linemen—like freshman Will Whitman—make an immediate impact on the team.
Coach Murphy had never before started a rookie offensive lineman, but Whitman has bucked the trend.
The 6’6, 280-pound rookie has started every game for Harvard this season, becoming the only lineman to be named to the watch list for the Jerry Rice Award, which is given to the best freshman in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).
And as other position players recognize, the list of impact linemen
doesn’t stop there.
“[Junior center] Jack Holuba, [junior guard] John Collins, [and sophomore guard] Austin Scheufele, they’re all doing a wonderful job this year,” says junior running back Treavor Scales. “They take pride in their job, and that’s one thing you can’t teach. It’s one thing you can’t coach, and they do it. It’s a beautiful thing.”
Despite the adversity, the offensive line has not missed a beat, making major contributions to the Crimson’s offensive production this season.
Allowing just 24 sacks in nine games, the offensive line has helped Harvard quarterbacks throw for just under 250 yards per game. It has also paved the way for the  Crimson running game, which has amassed over 1,600 yards on the ground.
The success of the offensive line has not gone unnoticed.
“A lot of times, the offense goes as far as the offensive line does,” Winters says. “To play as well as we have all season, a lot of that goes to the offensive line. They’ve done a great job buying time for protection and making holes for our running backs. We have a lot of talent at the skill positions, but the only reason we’re able to use it is because of them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It would be hard to imagine a worse start to the season for Harvard quarterback Collier Winters.
In the final minutes of a season-opening loss to Holy Cross, the fifth-year senior dove into the end zone on a two-point conversion and pulled his hamstring.
“It was a weird injury,” Winters says. “At first, I did not think it would be that much of a problem, and then I got over to the sideline and it got tight. It felt sore, and I couldn’t put a lot of weight on it.”
Winters would finish the game, but the Crimson offense failed to mount a comeback, falling to the Crusaders, 30-22.
“The first game was definitely a tough loss for us, but it also was a reality check for us and made us focus in for the rest of the season,” Winters says.
Despite the injury, Winters hoped to play in the next game, the Ivy League and home opener against Brown.
“I spoke to [Harvard] coach [Tim] Murphy and the trainers throughout the week and tried to convince them that I could play,”
Winters says. “I convinced myself that I could play, but in reality, I don’t think I would have been able to do a lot that game.”
Fearing the injury was more serious than Winters let on, the coaching staff rested the senior in favor of junior Colton Chapple. In three previous starts during his sophomore season, Chapple had gone 2-1, but he had little Ivy League experience.
“With Collier going down, I knew I’d have to step up in a big game,” Chapple says. “I knew I didn’t have to do anything spectacular. I just had to play well enough to win and give our playmakers the ball.”
Amidst the rain that hit Harvard Stadium that night, Chapple stepped up in a big way, throwing for 207 yards and two touchdowns in a 24-7 win over Brown.
With a big Ivy win under his belt, Chapple’s self-confidence grew greatly.
“I knew that I could play starting quarterback in this league and be successful [after the Brown game],” the Alpharetta, Ga. native says. “That gave me a huge boost of confidence.”
From the team’s perspective, the change in quarterback did little to disrupt the overall game plan and team dynamic.
“Both [Winters and Chapple] throw the ball very well, [and] they both run the ball very well,” says junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk. “We all trusted Colton and his preparations. It was a pretty seamless transition between the two of them.”
Despite the strong performance of his understudy, Winters was looking to get back into action as soon as possible.
“Coach Murphy and I butted heads [over my fitness],” Winters admits. “[It was] nothing personal, but he saw it one way, [and] I saw it a different way. We sat down and talked about it, and eventually, I have to go with what he says.”
In hindsight, Winters now sees his coach’s logic and appreciates the way the situation was handled.
“Looking back on it, I think it was the right decision,” Winters says. “[Coach Murphy] did a good job of looking at things outside of the next week [and] looking at the whole picture of the season.”
While Winters focused on his physical rehab, Chapple continued to light up the scoreboard. In his next Ivy League game, the junior threw for four touchdowns and 414 yards against Cornell, defeating the Big Red, 41-31. With his performance, Chapple registered the second-most passing yards in a single game in Harvard history.
Chapple was not to be denied a school record for long. In the next game against Bucknell, the junior threw for 176 yards and five touchdowns in just over one half of play. With the performance, Chapple became the first player in school history to throw four or more touchdowns in consecutive games and only the second player to throw for five touchdowns in a single contest.
With his backup breaking records, Winters knew the pressure was on to perform at the same level to maintain his starting job.
“During those weeks that he was playing and performing well, it made me focus my energy and efforts on my rehab and staying involved in the game plan and film,” Winters says.
After the Bucknell game, with Winters back at full health, the team had little idea who would end up running the offense for the Princeton game the next weekend.
“We weren’t really sure who was going to be our starting quarterback that week until a few days before the game,” Juszczyk says. “But as a team we felt confident with whoever they put in there.”
And, despite Chapple’s record-breaking performance the week before, Murphy and his staff eventually decided to reinsert Winters into the offense against the Tigers.
The decision left Chapple disappointed, but the junior understood his coaches’ choice.
“You have to respect their decision to go with their fifth-year senior,” Chapple says. “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to be out there and playing, but that’s everyone’s [goal].”
With the pressure of Chapple’s previous performances riding on his back, Winters reminded everyone why he was the first-choice starter. In his first game back in five weeks, Winters threw for 403 yards and became the third Harvard player to throw for five touchdowns, accomplishing what Chapple had done the week before. The Crimson ran out of Harvard Stadium with a 56-39 win over Princeton.
In the next three games, Winters racked up four touchdowns on the ground and four more through the air, marshaling the Crimson attack as the squad topped Dartmouth, Columbia, and finally Penn to claim the Ivy League title outright.
With Winters graduating, Chapple is now next in line to assume control of the Harvard offense. And Juszczyk has no doubt that the junior will pick up where he left off this season.
“Colton is a really good decision-maker,” Juszczyk says. “He never forces the ball into tight spots, but he also has a knack for a big play. He does a good job of keeping his eyes downfield. I’m pumped. I think [next year] is going to be great.”
After his last game in a Harvard uniform on Saturday, Winters believes he is leaving the Crimson football program in strong shape.
“A lot of freshmen stepped up and made plays for us this year,” Winters says. “We got a lot of young talent back [next year].”
“The future is in great hands with Colton,” Winters adds. “He’ll be a great leader, and he’s definitely an experienced guy on the team. ... Hopefully, we’ll be able to return to the same level play we had this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Ivy League title already clinched, the year’s final contest may seem—in some sense—meaningless, merely the last time the seniors will don the Crimson or the Blue and White.
But that’s not how the players—nor the 50,000 fans in attendance—will see tomorrow’s contest at the Yale Bowl, the 128th showdown in one of the most hallowed rivalries in college sports.
“At the end of the day, this is our biggest game of the season,” says junior running back Treavor Scales. “Regardless of the stakes, we have always treated it as such and will continue to do so. It’s not an opportunity for us to take our foot off the gas pedal here. We’ve got to keep on accelerating and finish the season on a high note.”
Harvard (8-1, 6-0 Ivy) comes in as the favorite against Yale (5-4, 4-2) after sweeping through league play unscathed and setting historic highs in offensive productivity. Averaging 39.4 points per game in conference play, the Crimson capped its run with a title-clinching 37-20 win over Penn on Nov. 12.
While not as prolific as its Harvard counterpart, the Bulldogs still boast a strong offensive attack. Led by senior quarterback Patrick Witt, Yale has tallied 232 points in its first nine games, good for third best in the Ancient Eight behind Harvard and Cornell.
Witt—a former Nebraska transfer and a 2010 first-team All-Ivy recipient—continued frustrating opposing secondaries this season, averaging 238 passing yards and nearly two touchdown tosses per contest.
For the Bulldogs, The Game’s most important play may have come off the gridiron. Witt, a Rhodes Scholar finalist, faced a dilemma that received national attention: with The Game and his Rhodes interview both scheduled for the morning of Nov. 19, Witt would have to choose one or the other. Eventually, Witt selected the former, withdrawing his Rhodes application.
“I’m not sure that [Witt’s choice] had to do with playing in The Game. I think it had to do with being with his teammates and fulfilling his commitment when he chose to be a member of a team,” Yale coach Tom Williams explains.
With Witt behind center, the Yale offense becomes far more potent.
“[Witt’s] a great player, and he’s definitely the heart of their offense,” says captain middle linebacker Alex Gedeon. “It definitely adds a big element to their offense. It’s going to force us to keep a lot more DB’s on the field and also concentrate on defending the pass.”
The Bulldogs will likely rely heavily on the pass against the Crimson, as Harvard boasts the league’s best rush defense, allowing just 91.2 yards per game. Even Dartmouth running back Nick Schwieger—the 2010 Co-Ivy League Player of the Year and the current league leader in rushing yards—managed just 51 yards against Harvard on 15 attempts.
“If we can control the line of scrimmage, we’ll control the game,” says senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz. “That’s how we won the past league games, and that’s how we intend to win the next one.”
Ortiz—considered by some to be the strongest player in Ancient Eight football—leads the defensive line with a league-topping nine sacks, including two last week in the critical victory over Penn.
Over the past three seasons, Ortiz has consistently stepped up on the biggest of stages, and in last year’s contest between Harvard and Yale, the defensive tackle notched 1.5 sacks in addition to a critical blocked punt.
“Josue gets to the ball carrier, he gets to the quarterback, [and] he makes big plays,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “At the end of the day, I think he will go down as one of the great defensive linemen in Harvard football history.”
While Ortiz and the defensive line have effectively shut down the running game, the Harvard secondary hasn’t enjoyed the same level of success. Plagued by inconsistency, the Crimson back line has yielded 232.9 passing yards per game, third worst in the league.
For the Bulldogs, though, perhaps the onus of victory falls on the defense, as it tries to slow down a multifaceted Harvard attack that ranks near the top of the conference in virtually every offensive category. Ten points away from tying the all-time Crimson scoring record for a single season, Harvard has a number of weapons at its disposal, both through the air and on the ground.
Leading the charge is senior quarterback Collier Winters. After missing Weeks 2-5 due to injury, the senior quickly reestablished himself as a dual threat. Averaging 247.8 yards per game through the air, Winters also has 211 rushing yards in his five games behind center.
“I can tell you right now, Collier is … playing at a whole other level,” Scales says. “The man is ballin’. It’s great to see.”
At his disposal, Winters has one of the deepest receiving corps in the league. In addition to senior wide receivers Alex Sarkisian and long-time big-play target Chris Lorditch, the quarterback also looks to tight ends junior Kyle Juszczyk and sophomore Cam Brate. Considered by Murphy to be perhaps the two best tight ends in his 18-year tenure, the duo has combined for 13 touchdown receptions and 753 yards receiving.
That depth at the receiver position permeates many aspects of the Crimson attack, including at running back, where Scales and freshman Zach Boden split carries. The rushing game has picked up steam as the year has progressed, and Scales now averages nearly five yards per touch while Boden comes in at just over six.
“Treavor Scales and Zach Boden are two of the best running backs in the league,” Winters maintains.
But Harvard will have to contend with a physical Yale defensive line. And while the Crimson offensive line gave Winters solid protection in the year’s first seven games, the past two haven’t gone as smoothly.
“[Yale] has a pretty big defensive line, so I think they’ll try and use that to stop our run and probably end up putting a little more pressure on the passing game,” Winters says. “[But] I think the offensive line will be ready. We’ll have some extra film sessions this week just to make sure.”
Put it all together, and against Harvard’s league-best offense and a formidable front seven defensively, the Bulldogs have their work cut out for them.
“If Yale beats us, they will have earned it, because we have no excuses,” Murphy says. “None. End of story. We’ll be ready to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College football fans will always remember the legendary 1961 Washington-Minnesota Rose Bowl prank orchestrated by Caltech students, in which thousands of Huskies faithful were tricked into holding up flipcards that read “Caltech” on national television. In 2007, Sports Illustrated ranked the stunt as the greatest prank in college football history.
But another shenanigan of 1961 also lives on, at least in Harvard-Yale lore.
At the time, The Harvard Crimson and The Yale Daily News occasionally published parodies of each other. Crimson editor Bruce L. Paisner ’64 pitched an idea to president Robert Ellis Smith ’62 months before The Game to craft a fake Yale Daily News special Saturday edition and distribute it in New Haven on the morning of Harvard-Yale.
The front-page story of the issue proclaimed that President John F. Kennedy ’40 had made the last-minute decision to attend the contest: “Kennedy to Attend Game Today, Arrives at Airport this Morning.”
“It seemed natural to have a lead story that Kennedy would be there,” Smith said 50 years after the famous stunt. “This was the first academic year that Kennedy was President, and there was a lot of excitement about it and a little speculation that he would be there.”
The story inundated readers with faux details of the President’s visit, but none so fantastic as to cause anyone to doubt the article’s veracity. Kennedy and his wife reportedly had seats on the 50-yard line and would be surrounded by Harvard administrators.
Yale officials would join the President as well—and that meant, of course, that they would have to sit on the Harvard side.
“Secret service [sic] men in plain clothes will be placed in section 30 of the bowl,” the story said. “Section 30 may be roped off if crowds gather.”
But it was indeed a crowd that The Crimson pranksters hoped to generate. In an editorial on page two of the prank issue, YDN “editors” praised Kennedy’s decision to leave the White House for some weekend “fun and merriment” and exhorted all Yale men to greet the President upon his arrival at the New Haven airport.
Immediately below the editorial, the parody printed a mock statement Kennedy prepared for the players and spectators, evoking one of his now-famous quotes in feigned eloquence: “Therefore, to the players on the field I say, think not about what you can do for your Alma Mater, rather think about what the other team can do to you. … And to the spectators in the stands I say, cheer not from fear but do not fear to cheer, for your vigor makes victory possible.”
Crimson editors meticulously compiled a full eight-page edition that looked and read like the real Daily News, though some features were clearly phonier than others.
A full-page photo spread documenting “Great Moments in H-Y Sports,” for instance, included pictures of dodgeball and motorcycle racing amid iconic images of football, crew, and baseball. On another page, a notice declared: “To insure [sic] adequate attendance at the game, theaters will be closed.”
Despite jabs and jokes tucked away in the YDN parody that may have led some to question the authenticity of the Kennedy story, Paisner coordinated a game-time stunt that sent the Yale Bowl into a frenzy. He convinced Smith to don a Kennedy mask and suit and enlisted the Harvard band to play “Hail to the Chief” right before game time.
“I was reluctant to do it at first,” Smith said. “I’m not that type of guy, but [Paisner] really pushed it on me, and I decided to do it.”
After the initial reservations, Smith joined the effort wholeheartedly and convinced one of his friends to wear his ROTC uniform at the game.
“He probably violated all sorts of rules by adding what was then called ‘scrambled eggs’ to his hat and his uniform,” Smith said. “That gave him a very high rank so he could pose as a military advisor.”
Before the game, a Harvard band member used the stadium’s public address system to announce Kennedy’s arrival.  As the band broke into “Hail to the Chief,” the faux military advisor and three impersonated secret servicemen flanked Smith as he marched out onto the field to applause and a standing ovation from the crowd.
Smith embraced his role and gave his best impression of the President.
“He had a distinguished way of sticking his hands in his overcoat pocket with the thumb sticking out that everyone knew as Kennedy, so that’s what I emulated while I waved to the crowd,” Smith recalled.
After a few minutes on the field, Smith tore off his mask and ran up to the press box, where he was covering the game as the alumni magazine sports correspondent. He remembers how peeved the other media members were, even as the debate raged on as to whether the spectacle was indeed Kennedy or not.
“The sports reporters were very unhappy about either being taken in or not being informed in advance by the White House,” Smith said. “I was concerned that I would be identified because I had the same coat on, but I had taken off the mask, so I wasn’t.”
Underdog Harvard went on to win The Game, 27-0, prompting The Crimson’s spirited lede in Monday’s regular edition: “The so-called experts can call Harvard’s 27-0 victory over Yale today [sic] anything they damn well please.”
Beneath the game recap, The Crimson ran a story divulging the hoax and details of the Saturday morning distribution. Editors had evaded Yale security throughout the morning, though one Crimson editor was apprehended but released after convincing the officers that it was a true Daily News edition he was distributing.
“I was really surprised to hear it was the 50th anniversary [of the prank],” Smith said last week. “I was very pleased to learn that, as I had been planning on going to The Game, and I had not known.”
The real President Kennedy would visit New Haven in June 1962 to receive an honorary degree and to deliver the commencement address to the senior class who had been fooled into thinking that he had sat in the stands at The Game.
The White House has yet to inform either The Crimson or the Daily News if President Obama will be in the stands tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What do primer cord, weather balloons, and model rockets have to do with the Harvard-Yale game? All have been utilized in MIT pranks on the day of The Game.
The Crimson’s crafty neighbors have used the annual Ivy matchup as a chance to display their notorious tomfoolery over the years.
The first noted Harvard-Yale prank instigated by students at the technical institute took place at Harvard Stadium during the 65th Game in 1948. Though the prank was never carried to fruition, it still lives on in Beaver folklore.
A few MIT students crept into the stadium the night before The Game and buried primer cord below the field to spell “MIT.” The miscreants planned to ignite the name of the university in the middle of the game, but Harvard groundskeepers discovered the cord and disabled the system.
On game day, the Engineers behind the prank were easily spotted and seized by officials. their heavy coats gave them away on the mild day.
The delinquents seemed to be in a tough spot when authorities found their coats lined in batteries clearly for the purpose of igniting the primer cord. But an MIT dean came to the pranksters’ rescue, retorting in their defense that “all tech men carry batteries.” The dean’s words have since grown into a popular phrase among Beaver students.
MIT struck again in 1982, in perhaps the university’s most popular prank against the Crimson. In the middle of The Game, a weather balloon inscribed with “MIT” popped out of the 50-yard line. The balloon then proceeded to inflate until it burst, leaving behind a talcum powder haze and the bitter taste of a successful Beaver prank. The Boston Herald headline read “MIT 1—Harvard-Yale 0: Tech Pranksters Steal the Show” the following morning to add further insult to injury.
In 1990, the Engineers stole the spotlight once again.
Just before Yale made a field goal attempt, MIT pranksters utilized a model rocket engine to send a banner with their university’s name across the field.
Then, in 1996, Beaver students infiltrated the scoreboard to take another jab at Harvard. MIT cunningly swapped the ‘VE-RI-TAS’ on the Crimson seal for ‘HU-GE-EGO’.
Tomorrow, Harvard will walk away Ivy League champions regardless of the result on the field, but a successful Beaver prank could put the Crimson further behind in the unofficial shenanigans standings with its long-time rival in jest, MIT.
Even though the Beavers haven’t hacked Harvard–Yale in recent years, Harvard and Bulldog fans alike should be on the lookout for any heavy coats, batteries, or balloons tomorrow.
Like the potent Crimson offense, the pranksters might strike at any time.

“We suck”?
It seems nonsensical to apply this phrase to Harvard’s performance at The Game in recent years. After all, Harvard football has beaten Yale in nine of the last 10 matchups, and current Crimson students have only ever witnessed Harvard triumph over its Bulldog rivals.
But for one moment on Nov. 20, 2004, Harvard certainly did suck.
On the day of the 121st Harvard-Yale game, 20 Yale students, led by then-seniors Michael Kai and David Aulicino of Pierson College, disguised themselves as members of a so-called Harvard pep squad. They invested in “pep squad” T-shirts and face paint, as well as 1,800 crimson and white posters. In a highly coordinated effort, the Eli pranksters distributed the posters to sections of mostly Crimson alumni and faculty.
Harvard fans were told the posters would spell “Go Harvard” from above. But when urged to hold up their pieces of the puzzle, the words “We Suck” could vaguely be read from across the stadium in the Yale sections.
The complex stunt certainly deserves some admiration. It was well-planned and executed and captured many people’s attention both in and out of Harvard Stadium, as the prank was covered by print and television media.
But Yale students seem to take obsessive pride in this momentary triumph. The prank organizers created a website, harvardsucks.org, to document that the incident did, in fact, happen. They even registered the domain yalesucks.org, fearing Harvard retaliation.
But is the prank’s execution really something to be so proud of?
The Crimson pummeled the Bulldogs, 35-3, in The Game. That year Clifton Dawson ’07 broke the Harvard single-season rushing record with a 120-yard performance on the ground. Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 impressed in his final game before entering the NFL. The senior class sealed its undefeated record against its Yale counterparts. And Harvard completed a 10-0 Ivy championship season with the most lopsided win against Yale in 24 years.
Maybe the time, energy, and resources consumed by the practical joke could have been devoted to a better cause: the improvement of Yale’s football team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard fans, this is the one weekend where we don’t have to convince you to travel to watch your team play. On Saturday, Nov. 19, Yale will be hosting the 128th edition of The Game. Hoards of Crimson fans will descend on the Bulldogs’ campus to show their school pride.
If you are not too busy partying, catching up with high school friends, tailgating, or watching The Game itself, here are some New Haven spots worth checking out:
1. Book Trader Cafe
This cafe and used book store, located near the center of Yale’s campus, is perfect for food and book lovers alike. Delicious sandwiches are given creative titles based on famous works of literature, such as “Jane Rare,” “Tempesto,” and “Sense & SensiBLT.” Like Bartley's with a snobby touch.
2. The Women’s Table
Harvard students always appreciate a good sculpture.
This installation, designed by architect Maya Lin, sits by Yale’s Sterling Memorial Library. By day, the engraved stone commemorates women in the school’s history. By night, Yale students have sometimes been known to slide across its watery surface. Who knows what you might witness?
3. Toad’s Place
Toad’s, a staple of New Haven nightlife frequented by many a Yale student, is throwing down on Saturday night. Although two people were shot, sustaining mild injuries, in this less-than-classy venue last spring, don’t let that discourage you. This is the one place where Cascada’s song “Evacuate the Dancefloor” might have true, urgent meaning.
So, gather your Crimson gear and get ready to venture to New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, this is Harvard’s year.
Already Ivy League champions, nationally ranked (No. 14) and undefeated in league play, it would be foolish to argue that the stats point any other way. Tops in the league in scoring offense, total offense and total defense, the Cantabs are having an Ivy League season for the ages.
On paper, it would seem Harvard has the Bulldogs’ number. Nine of the last 10 and four straight wins means no one on the Yale roster has ever beaten Harvard. Period. On paper, recent trends suggest the 128th playing of the Game will go the Crimson’s way.
And while relative literacy rates of the two teams would suggest that Yale players would be (much...) more aware of the odds stacked against them as written by stats and the media, they are also well aware that no game in a rivalry like this is played on that particular page.
Instead, it’s played with the weight of 127 pages of history looming over it—127 seasons of players who defined their careers by the success of this game. For Yale football players, careers are defined not by stats, not by expectations and not by what’s on paper, but simply by whether they upheld a tradition of class, hard work, and commitment to beating Harvard.
In a game that defines everything, emotions run high, injuries are irrelevant, and season records hardly matter. The way in which players have handled the first nine games matters little compared to how they handle the 10th. Grit, mental toughness, and individual responsibility become paramount: the game falls into the hands of its individual players. And the individual members of a senior class that has never beaten Harvard will make difference Saturday.
On paper, Harvard comes in with the Ivy League’s top offense, but it will face a Yale defense that features some stellar individual achievers. Captain Jordan Haynes is the Ivy League’s leading tackler with 9.3 per game. Senior defensive end Jake Stoller is eighth in the league in sacks. Senior corner Drew Baldwin is second in passes defended. Senior safety Geoff Dunham is Yale’s active interceptions leader.
The talent is there, on paper. But off the page is where the real difference lies. Haynes said he considers the tight-knit senior defensive corps “his brothers.” That group gets one last chance, not only to beat Harvard, but to play with each other as family in a Yale tradition to which they feel they still have a duty.
On paper, Yale’s doing pretty well at quarterback, too. Senior Patrick Witt has thrown for 238 yards per game and 16 touchdowns this year, good for second in the league after Cornell’s Jeff Mathews. Witt is the most prolific passer in the 139-year history of Yale football, but the stats don’t tell the story there. The real story is Witt’s decision to give up the Rhodes scholarship to play in The Game. Whatever you think about the choice, Witt’s sense of duty to his teammates, to the Yale football tradition, and to finally beating Harvard outweighed the chance to possibly secure his next three years. One game, one chance, one tradition. On paper, the Rhodes was the logical choice for a Yale political science major seeking an eventual career in politics. But the importance of Yale tradition goes far beyond logic.
Senior running back Alex Thomas is Yale’s active career rushing leader with 1,684 yards, but he understands the part he still must play in the Yale tradition. Thomas broke Connecticut’s all-time records for high school rushing yardage, touchdowns, and overall points, and grew up just minutes from the Yale Bowl, so he’s aware of the Yale football lineage. For all his accomplishments, Thomas knows there is one thing Yale fans must see their hometown hero do: beat Harvard.
Senior punt returner Gio Christodoulou is second in the league in punt return average and is Yale’s all-time leader in punt return yardage (831 yards over four seasons), the second-highest total among active players in Football Championship Subdivision.
Back for a fifth season after missing most of one with medical hardship, Christodoulou said the “main reason” he came back was “to beat Harvard.”
On paper, I know I’m making an argument in a way only a Harvard student would: providing a plethora of counterexamples I can’t disprove, citing only intangible evidence and not proving anything substantiated by stats or facts. But any Yale student understands that it is something more than stats, history, and paper that separates us from Harvard. It’s camaraderie, tradition, and attitude. It’s an understanding of responsibility—it’s pride and it’s heart. On paper, Harvard is better this year. But we don’t measure things here on paper: we measure them in duty, belief, and tradition. And that will make all the difference Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s season is basically already over. The champagne has been enjoyed, the Powerade spilled, the riots subdued.
Really, the Crimson is only playing tomorrow as a favor to Yale.
It’s a little bit like that one party that kid threw back in high school. He was sort of weird, but you told him that you were going to come anyway even though you really didn’t want to. A few hours beforehand, you gave the kid a call.
“Hey dude, listen. Something’s come up, and I can’t come tonight.”
“Really?!?” the friend said sadly. “I told everyone you were going to be here.”
“Seriously?”
“Yeah, everyone is expecting you. We’re all so excited to get together!”
Begrudgingly, you consent, even though it’s probably going to be a waste of your time, and you could have just as easily stayed at home.
This is how we see The Game tomorrow. Yale, we’re coming down as a favor to you so you don’t disappoint all of your friends in New Haven.
The Game isn’t even going to be a game. Harvard has won nine of the last 10 meetings. What’s the most notable thing you guys have done in that stretch? Some students got tazed at a nightclub, your alumnus left the White House, and you guys managed to get a bunch of Harvard fans to hold up colored cardboard signs that looked more like a Microsoft Paint editing job than “We Suck.” Your admissions office made a music video that probably did more for Harvard recruiting than anything Dean Fitzsimmons ever could.
Personally, we’re not particularly thrilled about having to go to Yale. Any school that merges its secret societies with its a cappella groups—Skull and Tones, anyone?—probably isn’t worth our time. Word on the street is that Harvard running back Treavor Scales thought about Yale until he realized that his last name would force him into New Haven’s dark netherworld of musical puns.
But as we think about it, why would anyone choose Yale? We don’t know either. In fact, we can give you a long list of reasons why Harvard is empirically better than that school down south.
1. Food: New England clam chowder vs. New Haven-style pizza. Honestly, we don’t really buy that changing around the crust a little bit really means that you’ve created a whole new “style.” When back home we leave a Pop Tart in the toaster for an extra 45 seconds, no one calls it a Pasadena-style pastry.
2. Airports: Logan vs. Tweed. Boston’s Logan Airport is a bustling hub for travel all over the world, a gateway to America, Europe, and even Asia. Your airport is called Tweed. You can only fly to Philadelphia. Need we say more?
3. Landmarks: We have Fenway Park, Boston Common, the Old North Church, and pretty much everything on the Harvard campus. You have a nightclub called Toad’s.
4. Occupy movements: Okay, this sucks for both of us. We know all of them should have gone to Brown anyway.
5. IKEA proximity: Congrats, Yale, you got us on that one.
6. Safety: Look, Boston’s no gated Florida golf community. But we’re no New Haven, either. You know your city is bad when it’s on Pakistan’s travel advisory list. And that part of town where your mother told you never to go? That’s all of New Haven.
But in all seriousness, we’re very excited for the game. Rumor has it that Yale’s football team has a fantastic rendition of “Brotherhood of Man” from “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” ready for halftime. No word yet as to how it will impact the Bulldogs’ play at the start of the third quarter.
And indeed, there’s an allure to New Haven as well. We’ve read that you guys have just unveiled a new statue of Handsome Dan, your beloved bulldog.
At Harvard, we know how to treat our iconic statues, and we’re happy to take that tradition down south with us. Clorox, anyone?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Mai Le, Harvard women’s soccer is all in the family. In just one year of action, the freshman midfielder has an Ivy League title under her belt.
But it isn’t her family’s first taste of success in the Ancient Eight. About 30 years earlier, her mother, Susan St. Louis ’81, won three Ivy championships of her own.
Despite her mother’s role in Harvard’s first league titles, Le did not arrive on campus with her family legacy in mind.
“I don’t feel any pressure to exceed my mom’s athletic accomplishments at Harvard,” Le said. “Her soccer records are incredible. I’m driven to do well and be successful just as much as every other girl on the soccer team, but nobody puts pressure on me to be my mom.”
Le, who tallied two goals and three assists in 13 games this season and helped the Crimson win its tenth Ivy League title, has already accomplished several of her personal athletic goals.
“I wanted to do whatever I could to help the team succeed,” Le said. “Then winning the Ivy League became less of a dream and more of a tangible possibility. I would be lying if I said I didn’t think about how cool it would be to have my team’s picture up on our locker room wall next to all the past champion teams, especially those which included my mom.”
Le attributes much of her success on and off the soccer field to her mother, who coached her for much of her pre-collegiate career.
“I think the most important things my mom has taught me are how to lead by example and to never do anything half-heartedly,” Le said. “She always showed me what to do—how to head a ball, how to follow through on my commitments and more—rather than just tell me.”
And as Le believes, her mother’s advice is worth taking. In her time at Harvard, St. Louis—a Harvard Hall of Famer—set many records that still stand today.
Le’s mother, a midfielder-turned-foward, holds the school record for most points scored in a game, tallying nine against Stonehill in 1978.
She also shares the Crimson record for most goals scored in a single game—netting four in that same late-70s contest—and tied her own single-game goal record against Stonehill again in 1979.
As a senior, she was tabbed as a first-team All-Ivy League selection and competed in the first NCAA women’s soccer tournament, helping Harvard finish third in the nation.
“[St. Louis] was one of the best athletes I had the opportunity to coach,” said Robert Scalise, Harvard’s first women’s soccer coach and current Director of Athletics, in an email. “She combined great athleticism with skill. Sue also had the ability to beat her opponents with the ball or without it. She could set herself up in position for a through ball or dribble around opponents to set herself up for goal scoring opportunities.”
But perhaps the most impressive thing about St. Louis, is that Harvard was her crash course in competitive soccer. She didn’t start playing soccer until one of her brothers introduced her to the sport during the summer after she graduated from high school.
“I tried out as a freshman in the fall of 1977, which was the second year that Harvard had a women’s team, and the team was still only a partially-funded,” St. Louis said. “I was very lucky to fall into that tiny window of time when it was possible to be a very successful woman soccer player without long-term training, if you were a good athlete. And I was successful beyond my expectations.”
Even without any competitive experience, Scalise was impressed the first time he saw her playing in Harvard Yard.
“[St. Louis] said she had never played on a formal team, but liked to kick the ball around with her brothers in her back yard,” Scalise said. “The rest is history.”
St. Louis’ athletic accomplishments did not end with soccer. She also lettered twice in lacrosse and once in track.
“It was not that uncommon to be a two- or sometimes even three-sport athlete,” St. Louis said. “There was very little off-season training, and that made it easier for athletes to move from sport to sport.”
Now, St. Louis’ focus has shifted to raising her three daughters and coaching high school soccer.
And through Le, her connection to Harvard soccer lives on.
“I wasn’t a Tiger Mom planning her career,” St. Louis said. “As she got older, and it became clear that she was an exceptional student and might be able to get into Harvard, I began to think about the possibility of her playing for the Crimson. I am so happy that she has had this chance to experience the joys I felt as a Harvard soccer player.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Generations of Harvard and Yale students have taken part in the wonderful tradition that is The Game. Interestingly, much of what we know and love about Harvard-Yale can be traced back to the very beginning of the rivalry’s storied history.
The schools’ football teams faced off for the first time on Nov. 13, 1875. Despite the steep entrance cost of 50 cents, 2500 fans showed up to New Haven’s Hamilton Park to witness Harvard’s 4-0 victory.
The game they played was still called football, but it would hardly be recognizeable to fans of the game today. The forward pass wouldn’t be legalized for another 20 years, and the two teams had to actually agree on the rules beforehand. Only upon Harvard’s urging did players agree that either side could run with the ball.
These days, The Game is associated just as much with the partying and the tailgating, but the associated shenanigans are as old as The Game itself. Students from both schools partied together after that first game, and seven Harvard students were arrested for, as the New Haven Register wrote, “Hooting and singing in the public streets.”
The rivalry has also been intense from the start. In fact, things went overboard as early as 1894, when nine players had to be removed because of either injury or ejection (two players got into a fistfight). The violence got so bad that one player lapsed into a coma for a few hours. As a result of the bloodshed, the two teams didn’t face off again until 1897.
This kind of violence caused many, including then-Harvard president Charles Eliot, to call for a ban on football altogether. Despite Eliot’s pleas, from 1897 onward, The Game has been played every year, save 1917-18 and 1943-44.
Even so, football certainly felt the effects of this violence. To make the game a little safer, a committee of coaches toyed around with the idea of widening the field in the early 20th century. But with Harvard Stadium already built, the coaches decided to allow for the forward pass starting in 1906.
It caught on quickly, with Yale using the tactic to earn a key first down en route to a 6-0 victory in The Game later that year. Another set of important rules were added in 1912, many of which are still in use today. 
The first two decades of the 20th century also saw the construction of Harvard Stadium (1903) and the Yale Bowl (1914), both of which are still homes for the two teams. Like The Game itself, each of these parks has an interesting spot in American sports lore. Harvard’s venue is the oldest stadium in the country, while Yale’s inspired one of the greatest college park in the country, The Rose Bowl.
In the first 40 years of the rivalry, then, the stage had been set.  The intensity of the rivalry, the revelry, the venues, and even many of the rules were all in place. Students and fans for the next century would feel the effects of these early years, as we will again tomorrow.
