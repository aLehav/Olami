After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much like the proverbial crow or magpie, Stephenie Meyer seems to be attracted to shiny things: the glittering vampires of “Twilight,” for example, or the shimmering parasitic aliens from “The Host.” Andrew Niccol’s film adaptation of this more recent novel does a good job of bringing these creatures to life in all of their splendor, but any truly outstanding film relies on more than its beauty alone. “The Host” is indeed a visually stunning film, but with its underdeveloped characters, awkward flashbacks, and voice-overs, it has little else to offer. 
“The Host” is set in the future on a seemingly perfect, utopian Earth that has been invaded by the Souls, an alien race that inhabits and controls the bodies and minds of humans. The film begins when the mind of Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan), one of the last remaining humans, is inhabited by a Soul named Wanderer. Unlike most humans, Melanie’s consciousness refuses to fade away after being invaded. Instead, Melanie, speaking to Wanderer mentally, convinces the Soul to seek out Melanie’s remaining friends and family. 
Although the premise of two minds inhabiting the same body is interesting, its execution in the film is awkward. While normal conversations are typically shot with a mixture of close-ups on a single actor and shots with both actors in one frame, a film in which the dialogue takes place inside a character’s mind does not have this luxury of variety. Instead, the conversations between Melanie and Wanderer in “The Host” are typically shot as a close-up on Ronan’s face with Wanderer whispering her responses aloud to Melanie’s voice-over comments. The visual monotony of these discussions is not helped by the fact that both Wanderer and Melanie are voiced by Ronan. The interactions become so tedious and dull that when Wanderer briefly occupies Melanie’s mind alone, one can’t help but wish Melanie would simply stay gone. Unfortunately, she returns almost as soon as you realize she has been missing. 
“The Host” also does a poor job of condensing the plot of the roughly 600-page novel into a two-hour movie, and the emotional development suffers as a result. The actual plot is slow to start; until it does, the backstory is revealed through heavily blurred flashbacks, voiced over by Wanderer as she describes Melanie’s memories to the Souls whose job it is to seek out and destroy the last remaining humans. In these brief fragmentary memories, Melanie meets and falls in love with another human, Jared Howe (Max Irons), but the two characters exchange maybe 10 lines. Their relationship is given almost no time to develop, and their emotional reunion later in the story seems unconvincing. The development of most of the other characters and relationships—for example, the romance between Wanderer and Ian O’Shea (Jake Abel), a human friend of Jared’s—is similarly brief and lacking in detail, making it difficult to sympathize with the characters. 
If “The Host” does one thing right, it is the visuals. If you removed everything from the film except the nature shots, you would be left with a tourism advertisement for some of America’s most scenic locations. All the outdoor scenes, glowing with golden light and saturated with vibrant colors, seem almost magically beautiful. The film even manages to transform the dry, barren deserts of the Southwest into a surprisingly alluring setting. The special effects are similarly well done. The feathery, glittery aliens sparkle delicately, and the electric blue gleam in the eyes of the possessed humans is pleasantly unnerving. Even the vehicles—gleaming chrome-covered sports cars and motorcycles—are stunning. 
“We do not change this world, but experience it and perfect it,” explains one of the Souls early on in “The Host,” but the audience soon realizes that this new Earth is anything but perfect. Its revitalized beauty cannot make up for the suffering that went into the creation of this new society. In a similar way, the beauty of this film itself is hardly worth the suffering of sitting through its entirety.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three big innings for Penn doomed the Harvard softball team to back-to-back losses in its Ivy opener on Friday.
Despite out-hitting the Quakers in the double-header, the Crimson (9-14, 2-2 Ivy) was unable to make the stops it needed and allowed its mistakes to build on themselves, leading to losses by scores of 6-3 and 7-2.
In the first game, Penn (13-11, 3-1) tallied five of its six runs in the bottom of the third, and in game two the Quakers posted four runs in the first and two in the third.
“We definitely let things get out of our hands and got in our own way,” junior captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson said. “Mistakes are always going to happen, but we let it turn into more.”
Pitching in their first career conference games, freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula allowed a combined five earned runs, and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz—who pitched the first inning of the second game—allowed four earned runs on four hits.
Despite opening the conference season without a win, Harvard coach Jenny Allard commended the young pitchers on their progress since the beginning of the season.
“We know as coaches and the team knows we needed to gain a lot of experience and that there would be ups and downs and growing pains,” Allard said. “We’re just trying to push forward and do things more consistently game to game.”
PENN 7, HARVARD 2
After winning the previous match-up, Penn jumped out to an early lead with a four-run first inning.
Back-to-back singles to open the game—combined with a throwing error by sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz—put runners on second and third with nobody out. Senior right fielder Brooke Coloma started the rally with a single to short and a steal.
After the next batter walked, junior third baseman Kayla Dahlerbruch came up with the bases loaded and slapped a single through the left side to bring one runner home, and freshman designated hitter Korinne Raby earned an RBI by drawing a walk on the Quakers’ next plate appearance.
After Halula came in to relieve Ruiz, the Crimson managed to turn a double play on a fly ball to center field, but the fourth run of the inning scored before sophomore Karina Rios—who pinch ran for Dahlerbruch—was tagged out at third.
“We would have a hit, a walk, an error, and then a big hit,” Allard said. “Instead of containing them, we let it develop into a rally inning.”
Harvard responded with a run of its own in the fourth on a solo homerun by junior third baseman Kasey Lange, but Penn came back with three more in the fifth. After consecutive singles with one out, the Quakers added two on a Coloma triple down the left field line, and Coloma came home on a wild pitch by Halula.
Olson brought home the final run of the game on a groundout to first in the seventh inning, but with two outs the Crimson could not build a rally when Lange popped out to second base to end the game.
“That’s what we’re going to focus on this week is getting more people to step up in the clutch,” Allard said.
PENN 6, HARVARD 3
Harvard had a chance to open its conference season with a win when Olson singled through the left side and Lange brought her home with a two-run jack in the top of the first.
But after holding Penn scoreless in the second, the Crimson gave up the lead in the third and never won it back, stranding 11 hitters over the course of the game.
“We had lots of runners on base, but we need to keep working on getting those runners to score,” Olson said. “We have all the pieces and we’re all good players. We just need to put it all together and get the timely hits.”
After inducing a groundout to lead off the third, Groom quickly found herself in trouble. A single through the left side brought home the Quakers’ first runner of the game and Groom responded by striking out the next batter.
With two outs, junior first baseman Georgia Guttaduro jumped on the pitch she liked and ended up scoring four—one of whom had reached on an error—with a grand slam.
The Crimson came up with a run in the top of the sixth on an Olson single, but Guttaduro’s solo homerun in the bottom of the inning sealed Harvard’s fate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long offseason, the Radcliffe lightweight crew was ready to get back on the water. One-hundred and sixty days after the Black and White varsity eight swept past defending champion Wisconsin to win its first ever Head of the Charles, Radcliffe reigned victorious once again on its home river.
On Saturday morning, the Radcliffe Lightweight boats took on Boston University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology at the inaugural Beanpot regatta for lightweight rowers. The Black and White tasted victory against local foes in each of its three races to start its spring season undefeated.
“It’s always a little tough, the first race of the season with everyone getting into their groove, and especially with how cold the winter’s been, we haven’t been on the water as much as we’d like to,” said senior Emma Lukasiewicz, who rowed in the sixth seat of the first varsity eight. “We just wanted to go out and have the best race we could to get started and I think we definitely followed our race plan and had a solid race from start to finish. We’re just going to have to keep building on that for the rest of the season.”
The spring season brought with it shorter races for the Radcliffe rowers, who stroked a three-mile race at the Head of the Charles compared to the 2000-meter Beanpot race. The novice rowers, who for the first time as collegiate rowers experienced side-by-side racing where the crews can compare their progress to other boats racing next to them rather than the staggered races of the fall season, found the adjustments challenging, but ultimately pulled out the win.
“For the past month or so, we’ve been doing a lot more sprint work, but it’s definitely a different race,” said freshman Nicole Golden, who stroked the novice four. “Racing the 2K is really exciting because you’re sprinting the whole time. In the fall race, you have a lot more time to think and get around, but [in the spring], it’s eight minutes, you give it all you got. It was definitely an adjustment, but it was a really fun one.”
The novice four rowed last and also had the closest race of the day, eclipsing its only opponent, the Engineers, by 18 seconds. The rookies, who also had to adapt to racing in a four-person boat instead of an eight-person boat, remained ahead of MIT over the length of the race to take home their first spring win, completing the course in 8:54.8.
“With the novice boat, you never really know what’s going to happen,” Golden said. “We had a really good start and then we just kind of pulled away and tried to hold on. It was also very exciting—it was our first race of the season so we were all really excited that we finished it and didn’t really remember what happened.”
First was the theme of the day for the first varsity eight, which was first on the water for Radcliffe and pulled out a first-place finish. The Black and White shot out to an early lead and never trailed, rowing the Charles in 6:59.6 and outpacing the second-place Terriers by over 19 seconds. MIT rounded out the race, coming in six seconds behind BU, which used the Beanpot to make its lightweight debut.
“[The Terriers] just created a lightweight program this year,” Lukasiewicz said. “They didn’t race in the fall, so we had no idea what to expect from them, but it’s really exciting that they’re part of the league now, to see the league growing, and they obviously performed really well, so that’s really cool to see. We’ve raced MIT a bunch in the past…but we’re definitely happy with the margins, so it’s a good start for the rest of the year.”
Up after the first varsity eight, the second varsity eight also found success, racing past the Engineers to win by a convincing 39-second margin. The Radcliffe crew finished in 7:26.0, setting the stage for the novice rowers.
After making history at the Head of the Charles, Lukasiewicz sees the spring season as both an opportunity to push boundaries and to substantiate the Black and White’s success.
“[HOCR victories] showed that we’re really strong and we’re getting better each year,” Lukasiewicz said. “That definitely motivated us for spring season because we felt more capable, but it also made us aware that we have to work really hard because it puts a target on your back and that there’s a lot of really good teams behind us. Wisconsin was not far behind us in the fall, and they’re always really good in the spring. It definitely pushed us to try to keep that competitive spot up top.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (4-5, 1-1 Ivy) hosted perennial powerhouse Duke (7-4, 1-1 ACC) under the lights at Harvard stadium on Saturday night. The Crimson came into the game unranked against the No. 12/10 Blue Devils but stayed with its opponents before eventually falling at the end, 12-11.
“I was very proud of our players’ effort today,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We really came out and wanted that game.”
The contest went back and forth the entire time, with neither team able to secure even a two-goal lead until the Crimson did so with 7:38 remaining in the game, 10-8.
From there, it was all Duke, and Harvard’s lead quickly evaporated. Within three minutes, the Blue Devils scored three straight goals and reclaimed the lead, which it later extended to 12-10 with 2:53 remaining.
But the Crimson refused to go away.
Freshman attack Devin Dwyer caught a pass, wide-open about five yards out, and scored to drop the lead to one. After winning the ensuing faceoff, Harvard forced a Duke pushing foul, giving the Crimson the ball, man-up, with eight seconds remaining in the game.
Harvard swung the ball around the cage and Dwyer attempted a pass to a shooter at the top of the box, but the pass was intercepted by Blue Devil goalkeeper Kyle Turri and time expired with Duke on top, 12-11.
“Up until late we made Duke earn their goals,” Wojcik said. “I think we slipped up a little bit late and…just broke down a little bit defensively.”
The Crimson struggled on ground balls and face-offs in the game, losing both battles to the Blue Devils, 31-25 and 18-8, respectively. Typically, these two stats, combined with the level of Duke’s individual talent, would be enough to put the game out of reach. Instead, Harvard made up for its fewer possessions by limiting turnovers. The Crimson had only two turnovers in the entire second half.
“[Limiting turnovers] is something we’ve been working on every day in practice,” senior captain Jason Gonos said. “We can’t give their offense second chances…and we did a good job of that today.”
The Blue Devils struck first, just under four minutes into the game, but never managed to put Harvard away.
Freshman attack Ian Audrey answered with a goal of his own halfway through the opening period. It was the first goal of his collegiate career in the first start of his career.
After Duke scored to take the lead once again, junior attackman Peter Schwartz found himself guarded by a short-stick midfielder, a clear mismatch, and drove him towards the goal. He then roll-dodged and scored to tie the score at 2-2, where it would remain until a sudden flurry of alternating goals occurred in the beginning of the second.
The Blue Devils got the first goal, but junior attack Carl Zimmerman answered for Harvard, beating his man and nailing the back of the cage. Duke scored another, but it was only a minute until the Crimson countered to tie the game for the fourth time of the night, when senior attackman Jack Walker got the ball behind the cage, drove around the goal, and scored.
The score then remained tied for six minutes, until Harvard’s leading scorer, senior midfielder Alex White, beat his defender and ripped a left-handed shot right between Turri’s legs to give the Crimson its first lead of the game. But the advantage only lasted one minute, before the Blue Devils leveled the score going into halftime, 5-5.
Both teams came out ready to go in the second half.
Duke scored first, but midfielder Gabriel Mendola responded for Harvard with one of the best individual plays of the night.
The junior took the ball down the middle of the field, receiving a series of checks from a Duke defensive-midfielder. Although none of them could stop Mendola, one of the checks was so hard that the defender lost control of his own stick. Mendola then took off towards the goal, split two Blue Devil defensemen, and scored.
Duke went up again, but the Crimson answered. Sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde, who until one week ago had not scored in his career for Harvard, scored his fifth goal of the week, man-up, after a Blue Devil slashing penalty.
With only eight seconds remaining in the quarter, White got the ball on Duke’s endline, drove around the goal and drew a penalty before time could expire. Vandervelde then scored his second, again man-up, to give the Crimson the lead, 8-7, 18 seconds into the fourth period.
The Blue Devils evened the score, but after another Duke penalty Harvard hit back. The Crimson man-up unit spun the ball around the back of the cage, Dwyer threw it to Vandervelde, and the sophomore scored, securing his second hat-trick in as many games.
Schwartz then added his second goal for the Crimson, giving the team a 10-8 lead, before the Blue Devils would rally and eventually win the game.
”It’s always tough to lose,” Schwartz said. “The positive for that game is that we took a step in the right direction which is good heading in to more [Ivy League] play.”
