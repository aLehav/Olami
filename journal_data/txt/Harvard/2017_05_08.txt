After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over four years at Harvard, I have found the transept of Memorial Hall to be one of the most profound spaces on campus. As many readers know, the transept contains 28 white marble tablets with the names of the 136 men affiliated with Harvard who died as a result of their service for the Union during the American Civil War. To me, the space has always encapsulated the immensity of the cause for which they died.
I thought of Memorial Hall last week when President Trump made his now-infamous comments about the Civil War. “People don't realize,” he began, “you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why? People don’t ask the question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?”
As historian Yoni Appelbaum notes in The Atlantic, “asking the question” of why the Civil War started is not itself a bad instinct. Presidents should, in fact, concern themselves with such historical problems. Today, for instance, is the 72nd anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, an appropriate day to consider the lessons of a conflict rife with misbegotten strategies. If Trump were to re-read Winston Churchill’s 1938 parliamentary speech denouncing the Munich Agreement, for example, he might gain a better idea of why compromise with Nazi Germany made so little sense, as well as why we should approach half-baked comparisons to 1938 with caution.
But Trump’s questions obviously do not inspire confidence that he will be hitting the primary sources. Is it too much to ask that the President enter office with some answer to why the Civil War occurred? Shouldn’t he know that, after 84 years of feckless compromise with slavery, the American system could no longer bear the contradiction with its founding ideals?
Failure to realize the moral issues at stake is the most inexplicable part of Trump’s statement. An insistence that four million human beings be kept as property is not, as Appelbaum puts it, an issue that is “amenable to deal making.” As Appelbaum goes on to state, “Sometimes, it is striking a deal which weakens a nation, and taking a principled stand which strengthens it.”
Trump’s fundamental historical ignorance hinders his ability to realize this core truth. He often appeals to moral righteousness—denouncing a vaguely-defined “American carnage” and declaring that “No child of God should ever suffer” the horror of chemical weapons—but his Civil War comments suggest he would not know the carnage of slavery if it introduced itself. His press secretary’s bizarre suggestion that Bashar al-Assad is worse than Hitler was another signal of his administration’s moral confusion. In clumsily deploying history, the Trump White House has insulted the memory of the past and failed to understand the moral urgency of the present.
Speaking eight years before South Carolina’s secession in his famous oration, “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July,” Frederick Douglass conveyed the just rage of abolitionism with the phrase, “Where all is plain, there is nothing to be argued.” His meaning is as clear today as it was in 1852: At some point, debating a moral transgression as great as slavery becomes an exercise in absurdity.
Of course, nothing is ever truly “plain” in politics and war. Even the Civil War was not “plain”—not for the tribes of the Plains, for whom the conflict was simply a continuation of their long running fight with federal cavalry units like the one in which Harvard student Thomas Joseph Leavitt died serving. That the same army fighting for human freedom was also decimating indigenous peoples is a tragic irony of American history.
Yet the moral force of Douglass’ statement remains. Wrongs like slavery are absolute, and the need to combat complacency towards manifest injustice remains as pressing as ever. Jimmy Kimmel, of all people, recently reminded Americans of this imperative when he said, “If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make.” Where all is plain, there is nothing to be argued.
Despite its biting tone, Douglass’ speech ended on an optimistic tone. “I do not despair of this country,” he declared. Why? Because he saw nascent globalization even in 1852 as an antidote to America’s moral blinders. “No nation,” he argued, “can now shut itself up from the surrounding world…No abuse, no outrage…can now hide itself from the all-pervading light.”
Unfortunately, openness alone was not enough to end slavery, nor to end all abuse and outrage in human history. Imperialism and world war—including the one that ended 72 years ago today for a shattered Europe—followed on the heels of more global interconnection.
The dark side of globalization is still evident, in the growth of reactionary ideologies and in profound economic and social dislocations. But Douglass’ faith was not entirely misplaced. Ultimately, free trade and free information did not serve as the final bulwarks against injustice; rather, people committed to the best ideals of human dignity did.
In the 1860s and 1940s, Harvard students died for those ideals. Today, we are fortunate not to face such cataclysmic conflicts. But we do face ignorance of their most profound lessons. Like Douglass during a period of more severe crisis, we should not despair, but rather combat ignorance with knowledge and moral clarity—because, where all is plain, there is nothing to be argued.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are too many ways to describe this place we’ve all somehow—by the grace of God, or Dean Fitzsimmons—wound up in. Harvard is diverse and exclusive, propelled by liberalism and tangled in tradition. Harvard provides an education that is illuminating in many ways, yet often leads to more questions than answers. Harvard is inspiring and stimulating, intellectually and emotionally. While it is usually a privilege to learn in this environment, it is sometimes a burden, because students feel that they must always, always do more, be better, and work harder. Harvard teaches us many things, but it doesn’t teach us how to be happy.
Harvard students have varying standards of success. Some value money, and dedicate their classes, extracurriculars, and time here to their quest for the Holy Grail—a job at Goldman Sachs. Others value social status; they constantly covet the next small envelope slipped under their door, and when the envelopes stop coming, the object of their desire becomes a tacit invitation to the elusive and ever-shrinking inner circle. Others measure success based on academic excellence or perfection. Most of us value some combination of all three. But few among us measure success by finding happiness in our daily lives.
On April 12, my grandfather, Fedor Kuritzkes, passed away peacefully in his home in suburban Pennsylvania. At his funeral, my father, uncles, aunt, and cousins partook in the age-old tradition of attempting to encapsulate his life in their brief eulogies, each of them under the morbidly comical time constraint of summarizing 87 years in five minutes.
My grandfather’s lifetime was not defined by the names on his resume or his academic standing. He did not attend an Ivy League college, and he humbly admitted that his grades were not good. As a pediatrician, he spoke only of his close relationships with his patients, never of his salary. His success was not measured by his social status, although he became a pillar of his community in Queens. He became a pillar in his community because his success was measured—by him and by the people who loved him—by the happiness he found in his own life, and the happiness he added to the lives of others.
My grandfather knew hardship. He was a Jew born in Chemnitz, Germany in 1929, and a de jure stateless person before he was school aged. He was in his apartment on Kristallnacht when Nazi thugs dragged his father out of his home and to Buchenwald. He and his family miraculously received visas to the United States in 1939, but they then had to assimilate to a new life in a new country where they didn’t speak the language, all the while coping with the loss of contact with their family members, friends, and neighbors, and later with the grief of knowing that everyone they left behind in their Jewish community in Germany had perished.
Harvard students, myself included, complain about a bad grade on a midterm as though it is the end of the world. My grandfather’s world fell apart before his young eyes but he rarely, if ever, complained about it. The only thing I remember him complaining about—in jest—was Heinz’ experiment with green ketchup back in the early 2000’s (sacrilege!). When I get upset about something as insignificant as my midterms, I try to think of my grandfather’s example, but I don’t always succeed. The never-ending drive for success that is synonymous with four years at Harvard is consuming.
After his stroke in 2014, as he deteriorated, my grandfather had the time to reflect on the life he and my grandmother built together. My grandfather looked at his wife, his four children, and his eight grandchildren, and confidently said he would not change a single thing about his life. He was a man without regrets. I wonder how many of us will leave Harvard prepared for such a simple life. A happy life. A life without regrets. We are used to striving for perfection, but we have not learned to see perfection in what we already have.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For decades, students have debated the importance of a multicultural center at Harvard, with strong feelings and advocacy by undergraduates. In light of the Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion’s 2015 report mentioning Harvard’s lack of a multicultural center and the Implementation Committee’s 2017 report suggesting the creation of a “multicultural agora,” the administration’s prolonged inaction is more and more conspicuous. We urge Harvard administrators to acknowledge the need for a multicultural center and to take the initiative in creating such a space for students.
A multicultural center would directly support the ideals of inclusivity on which the College has prided itself. By allowing cultural groups to have a physical space to come together to celebrate their backgrounds while inviting other students to participate, such a location would make it easier for these student groups to hold events that promote inclusivity in a safe and welcoming environment. The construct of such a center will furnish students with an opportunity to decorate and design the location as they please. 
These are not mere hypotheticals. The benefits of a multicultural center have been recognized by peer institutions, who continue to support and allocate funds for similar spaces.
Opponents of the establishment of a space cite concerns that it would allow self-segregation which would divide the student body. We believe that this concern is unfounded. As previous advocates of a multicultural center have argued, it would certainly bring benefits for students of color, but also be an important asset to the entire student body. It would permit students who do not belong to affinity groups to learn more about those who have different backgrounds.
Moreover, Harvard has even established one potential model for itself: Hillel thrives as an example of how a cultural space can benefit both the members of that cultural group as well as the entire Harvard community. Hillel has united, not divided, the student body. We call on Harvard to recognize that, rather than promote self-segregation, a multicultural center would foster greater inclusivity and a celebration of all identities.
These advantages have been recognized for years at other schools. Harvard is in a phase of expansion, renovation, and construction with the planned expansion to Allston and the University’s ongoing plan to update the Houses. It is high time for Harvard to demonstrate its commitment to inclusivity by establishing a multicultural center.

Michael J. Berens and Patricia Callahan, reporters at The Chicago Tribune, were awarded the 50th Worth Bingham Prize for Investigative Journalism at Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism last week for their reporting on group homes in Illinois.
Since 1967, the Nieman Foundation's award has honored investigative reporting that serves the public interest. Berens and Callahan reported and wrote a three-part series called “Suffering in Secret,” which explored malpractice in some Illinois group homes for low-income adults with disabilities.
Berens said he first wanted to write the story after hearing similar accounts of group home practice in other parts of the United States.
“The origins of this story came when I was in Seattle for a conference about the state of group homes in Washington, and I thought that there had to be exploitation of seniors back in Illinois,” he said.
Berens said he then returned to Illinois and partnered with Callahan. Early on in his reporting, he said he  realized that the state actively hid the addresses of their group homes.
The duo filed more than 100 public records request to find the locations of the group homes and began investigating the conditions in them. They reported that many of the homes were run-down and underfunded and the government misallocated money to them.
During the ceremony, Callahan and Berens said they felt empowered to give a voice to those who might otherwise be voiceless. Berens and Callahan recalled a story about Thomas Powers, a mute senior who lived in one of the group homes and was found dead in a storage closet that had a sign that stated that “the room was not fit for human occupancy.”
“Thomas Powers was literally voiceless, and because of these group homes, he was found dead on a soiled mattress in a storage closet,” Callahan said.
After the first stories, the government began reforming group homes regulations, Berens said. There are currently seven pieces of legislation pending in the Illinois legislature looking to reform group home living.
“Group homes are viewed as better than the dilapidated institutions, however, I worked on investigations in two states now, and I can tell you they are not,” Berens said.
Berens and Callahan also received $20,000 sum from the Nieman Foundation to accompany the award.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith—a computer scientist by trade—is taking a hands-off approach to the wave of academic dishonesty cases in Harvard's flagship Computer Science course.
In an interview Friday, Smith said he “didn’t know enough to speak in detail” about the spate of academic dishonesty cases in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.” More than 60 students enrolled in the course last semester faced academic dishonesty charges, The Crimson reported last week.
But Smith, who used to teach CS50, said he had no plans to talk with the course’s head instructor David J. Malan ’99—whose dissertation Smith advised. Smith added that he was reluctant “to get involved too deeply” in the Computer Science department, where he still teaches.
Though Smith said he had not yet read The Crimson’s coverage of the CS50 cases as of Friday, he said that the amount of information about the cases made public was more than “makes us comfortable." The College is working to maintain the confidentiality of the students involved in the cases, according to Smith.
He added that the Honor Council makes individual reports to professors about their findings, “so that there’s feedback in the system and it doesn’t have to go public to back to the Honor Council to back to the faculty members.”
“One of  our major concerns in our whole thing is that we are a learning institution, students are going to make mistakes,” Smith said. “You don’t learn unless you make mistakes. In my opinion you shouldn’t do academic dishonesty things but we also want to be able to provide environments where students that are making mistakes can have those mistakes be a learning opportunity for them.”
This is the second major public wave of academic dishonesty cases in a class during Smith’s tenure. In 2012, more than 120 students enrolled in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” underwent investigation for cheating.
“I don’t know enough details about what’s happening in this case to comment on any parallels” between the Government 1310 and CS50 situations, Smith said.
After the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard instituted a number of reforms— including creating the Honor Council.

Renovation of Adams House is expected to begin in June 2019, according to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
Adams House Faculty Deans Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 announced the planned renovation—the sixth installment of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project—in an email to Adams residents on Wednesday.
Adams construction is expected to overlap slightly with the two years of construction on Lowell House, which is set to begin in June and end in August 2019, according to Smith.
Although FAS has three renewal projects behind it—Quincy House’s Stone Hall, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and the entirety of Dunster House—as well as one, Winthrop House, set to open next semester, Smith said Adams House will pose a unique set of challenges for architects and builders.
“Adams House is, I think, exciting to the team because we have the opportunity of looking at many different buildings that were built in many different years and built in different styles,” Smith said. “The urbanscape and the fact that there’s not an easy way to connect all of the [buildings] is going to be an interesting challenge for us as we go through.”
Smith said FAS administrators chose Adams as the next House after considering the various challenges posed by each of the unrenovated Houses, such as Eliot House and Kirkland House.
“Eliot and Kirkland are complicated by the fact that there’s a shared kitchen between the two of them which requires quite a bit of thought to be had not only within the FAS and the College and the House system, but in interactions with the University who runs HUDS for us,” Smith said.
While the Adams House announcement indicates that FAS is forging ahead with House renewal for years to come, the project has been beset with financial barriers, including an underperforming endowment, dwindling FAS cash reserves, and lukewarm support from donors. House renewal has lagged behind other areas of the University’s $7 billion capital campaign.
Much like Lowell House, Smith said the Adams renovation will be financed primarily through donations and taking on debt.
“I don’t have any other cash at this point,” he said.
Smith said he is thinking about ways to creatively fundraise for Adams, including highlighting the House’s history as a haven for artists. Before former Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57 randomized the composition of the Houses in 1995, Adams was known for attracting artistic and quirky undergraduates.
“Arts are big on campus right now and Adams was an arts House and still has a rich culture within the arts,” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sticking to a promise to limit himself to two or three terms, Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen will not seek re-election this November.
After four years on the City Council, Mazen—who has previously advocated self-imposed Councillor term limits—announced he will step back from the body to focus on political organizing and neighborhood mobilization.
“I think we can all come together in advocating for the major issues we have, which are affordable housing, education equity, and economic mobility,” Mazen said.
Elected in 2013, Mazen became the first Muslim ever elected to a Massachusetts governing body and the City Council’s youngest member. Mazen received the most votes of any Council candidate in the body’s 2015 election.
Mazen said that after the election, he hopes to keep working with various Cambridge organizations and his nonprofit Jetpac, which trains minority candidates to run for office.
“I’m continuing to put a lot of time into Jetpac, which is training folks to become community organizers and, we hope, to go on and run for office, and that’s going really well.” Mazen said. “I’m also training some folks here in Cambridge, so I want those folks to continue to have success on the local and state.”
Looking forward to the election, Mazen said he supports two of his fellow Council members for their proven dedication to city governance.
“Incumbent candidates Jan Devereux and Dennis Carlone are a breeze to work with because they work so hard. Really, I feel that the group is service oriented,” Mazen said.
Mazen also listed a number of new candidates he said he was excited about, including Nadya Okamoto ’20, a Harvard freshman from Portland, Oregon.
“You have new candidates like Quinton Zondervan, Olivia D'Ambrosio, Sumbul Siddiqui, and even Harvard’s own Nadya Okamoto,” he said.
Cambridge’s City Council election will take place on November 7, 2017. Nineteen Cantabrigians have so far declared their candidacies for nine seats.

The enormous online popularity of Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”  made it easy for enrollees to find answers to problem sets on the Internet, potentially facilitating cheating in the course, according to some CS50 staffers.
More than 60 students enrolled in CS50 last semester were accused of academic dishonesty and appeared before the Honor Council, the College’s administrative body that hears academic dishonesty cases, The Crimson reported last week. The spate of cases represents roughly ten percent of the class’s 636 total fall enrollees.
While CS50 students and former teaching fellows said what they called the course’s vague collaboration policy may have caused students to cheat unintentionally, the course’s recent expansion and the online availability of answer keys likely also played a role, according to some course staffers.
In 2012, CS50 head instructor David J. Malan ’99 took the course online, making his lectures available to the public through the digital education platform edX. Two years later, Malan—who did not respond to a request for comment—moved to expand CS50 to Yale. And in September 2016, Malan declared that Harvard students enrolled in CS50 had to attend just two lectures in person each semester.
In total, tens of thousands of people have taken CS50 in some way.
Former CS50 teaching fellow Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’15 said he believes the class’s recent expansion likely increased the number of problem sets answers available online. The problem sets for each version of the course are the same, and three former CS50 staffers said Malan does not often update course assignments.
“I mean, having such a huge community—it’s not just about the students that are currently in the class but also edX and the online community—that makes it much more difficult to avoid having online answers posted,” Grozen-Smith said.
CS50 enrollees can post and view problem set code online on at least two different question-and-answer forums.  Students in the course can also upload problem set answers to file-sharing websites like GitHub.
CS50 course staff operate a publicly accessible forum on Reddit—linked on a teaching fellow course policy document—where students can post code and ask questions. Posted code remains public, though the Reddit forum guidelines urge users to use their best judgment.
“Keep in mind the Academic Honesty guidelines,” the Reddit guidelines read. “Try to ask your question in plain English… If you must post code, please mark your post as ‘spoiler.’”
Another forum, called “Discuss,” is run by course staff and accessible only to those taking or teaching the course, according to a current CS50 teaching fellow. The teaching fellow said many Harvard enrollees use the platform to post code and ask course staff questions about it. The Crimson granted anonymity to the teaching fellow because CS50 course staff are instructed not to speak to the press about the class.
The teaching fellow said course staff usually set posted code to “private” so that only CS50 staffers can see it. He added that he occasionally saw students publish entire problem sets on the Discuss forum, and that course staff were not always able to make these posts confidential in a timely fashion.
“That could have contributed to [the cheating], if we don’t catch it right away then people can definitely see other people’s code on there,” the teaching fellow said.
The fact that Malan does not often update the CS50 problem sets makes it even simpler for students to find old answer keys online and elsewhere, according to three course staffers. Grozen-Smith said Malan completely revamps one problem set on average every two or three years, leaving the rest mostly untouched.
Though he admitted he thought Malan’s method of not updating CS50 problem sets can facilitate cheating, Grozen-Smith said he thought Malan was right to keep the assignments the same.
“I would not say that the professor should be thinking, ‘I have to change the p-set so that people don’t cheat,’ I think it should be more, ‘Let’s figure out how to get a p-set that will teach it the best,’” Grozen-Smith said.
Grozen-Smith said he thought that, to some extent, cheating is unavoidable in any computer science class.
“That is the nature of computer science, in the real world you do copy people’s code a lot," Grozen-Smith said. "It happens not at all just in CS50 but in every computer science class I took."
“It is pretty easy to cheat,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday’s game had a feeling of déjà vu for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team.
The Harvard Crimson (8-8, 4-3 Ivy), for the second weekend in a row, traveled to Ithaca, N.Y., to take on the No. 11 Cornell Big Red (12-5, 6-1).
This time around the stakes were far higher. After last week’s 13-6 loss to Cornell saw Harvard lock up the fourth and final spot in the Ivy League women’s lacrosse tournament, the Crimson returned to the Big Red’s home turf for the tournament semifinal on Friday.
The winner would get a chance to play for the conference title and a trip to the NCAA tournament, while the loser’s season would end abruptly.
In the end, despite the heightened importance, the final result turned out the same, with Friday’s contest playing out much like last weekend’s matchup.
Harvard got off to a strong start, but the same problems that cost the team a week before came back to haunt the Crimson in its return to Schoellkpof Field. The team ran into foul trouble too often and Cornell took advantage with clinical finishing coupled a rock solid performance in net. At the final whistle, the Big Red claimed yet another victory over Harvard, beating out the team, 16-11. With the loss, so too went the Crimson’s season.
“I think we played really hard as a team, and unfortunately we came up a little short,” sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee said.
For the second contest in a row, Harvard held its own in most areas of the game against nationally-ranked Cornell. The Crimson only allowed one more draw control to their opponent and swept 15 ground balls to Cornell’s 16. Harvard topped its opponent in clear percentage, getting the ball out of the zone on 12 of 14 attempts, while the Big Red went 14-17.
However, just like last weekend, the difference between the teams showed in their foul counts. The Crimson racked up 36 infractions, while Cornell recorded just 23.
The Big Red was as ruthless in punishing Harvard for its fouls this week as it was last week. The visitors received two yellow cards, and Cornell converted a man-up goal each time. The Big Red also scored on five of its eight free position opportunities.
The game did differ from last week’s contest in that Harvard jumped out to a quick lead. Junior midfielder Julia Glynn, senior attacker Marisa Romeo, and MacAfee each picked up a goal in the first seven minutes, following a Cornell score 90 seconds in. By the 21st minute, the Crimson was leading, 3-1. The Big Red held a 6-1 advantage over Harvard at the same point in last Saturday’s matchup.
However, the Crimson’s hot start wouldn’t be enough to overcome its errors or Cornell’s efficiency in front of net. The Big Red exploded for an 8-3 run in the first period. Cornell would be ahead by three points, 6-9, by half time.
Two of the Big Red’s first-period finishes came from free position opportunities. Cornell also converted on two run-of-play chances stemming from Harvard fouls. At the same time, the Big Red was nearly twice as efficient in front of goal as the Crimson, scoring nine times on 13 shots in the opening period. Harvard fired off 16 shots on frame but only managed a 38 percent conversion rate.
Cornell senior goalie Renee Poullott was largely to blame for the Crimson’s offensive woes. The netminder—ranked fourth in the nation for save percentage—made six stops on the day compared to Harvard’s two.
Poullott’s prowess between the pipes, as well as a trouble with accuracy that has flared up intermittently throughout the season, meant that Romeo, MacAfee, and tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon—the team’s top scorers—were limited to just seven goals between them on a combined 21 shots.
“We didn't accomplish our goals but we fought hard and stuck together,” Romeo said.
With the Crimson’s top three goal-getters struggling to find the back of the net, at least by their own high standards, it was up to Glynn to provide Harvard’s offensive spark. The junior picked up four finishes, including three in the first half.
Glynn’s second and third goals punctuated three and two-point runs for Cornell, respectively, to give the Crimson some much-needed momentum. McMahon also made sure that Harvard got the last word in the opening stanza, snapping a 3-0 Big Red streak with the final score of the half at 2:38.
The Crimson couldn’t maintain its momentum after the restart, though. Harvard was hurt once again by its fouls, as Cornell picked up two man-up goals and two free position scores in the second half.
The Big Red converted its first free position opportunity of the second period less than two minutes after halftime, and the Crimson wouldn’t get a goal back for 10 minutes. By that time, Cornell had already added two more scores to its second-stanza tally, but McMahon’s second finish of the game and 26th of the campaign cut the Big Red’s lead to five and gave Harvard hope.
Cornell scored a pair of quick goals, but the Crimson responded through three familiar sources. MacAfee, Glynn, and Romeo each picked up another score to reduce the Big Red’s advantage to four points, putting Harvard within reach with 13 minutes remaining.
However, in another echo of last week’s contest, Cornell’s defense, ranked seventh in the nation, squashed any hope of a Crimson comeback. Romeo would score again from a free position chance to complete her hat trick, but the Big Red otherwise managed to keep Harvard off the board for the remainder of the game.
Cornell also got two more goals through Crimson fouls to seal the result. The Big Red scored the first in a man-up position before putting away a free position chance with 2:30 left on the clock to ice the game.
Although the team will be disappointed to bow out of the Ivy League tournament in the first round for the fourth-straight year, it is a testament to the group as a whole, and particularly its senior class, that Harvard has qualified for the tournament for four years in a row.
“I think our seniors were anchors for our team, not only [against Cornell] but all season,” MacAfee said. “They're an irreplaceable group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 800-meter run is infamously one of the worst events to compete in and it’s probably even harder to run with only one shoe. But that is exactly what Myles Marshall did.
Losing his cleat in the final 200 meters of the race, the sophomore finished the final turn and sprint with only a sock between his foot and the track, holding off Brown’s Zachery Emrich to claim the gold—by .05 seconds.
Marshall would not celebrate his gold alone. At the Ivy League Outdoor Heptagonal Championships hosted this weekend by Yale at their Cuyler Field and Dwyer Track, the Harvard women’s team monopolized their track and field success this season by bringing home their third, of three, Ivy League championship. The victory secures the program’s first ever triple crown, with additional golds in both the Ivy League Indoor and cross country championships. The men’s team placed fourth overall, only one point behind third place Penn.
For the women’s team, the win represents a continuation of the program’s recent dominance within the Ancient Eight. The victory is their fourth consecutive gold at the Outdoor Heps, on the heals of their fifth Indoor Heps championship in late February.
“Going into this Heps, our women's team wasn't favored to win,” co-captain Raegan Nizdil said. “I think that's what makes this victory so sweet for us. With a record like ours, it's easy to get complacent. This weekend, however, we were anything but. Our girls really gave it their all and laid it all out on the track, and I've never been more proud as a teammate or captain.”
Sophomore Gabby Thomas continued to play a large role. The indoor All-American was golden on the day, winning—or helping to win—every single event she competed in. Overall, Thomas brought home five gold medals and was unanimously named Most Outstanding Track Performer. On Saturday she led off the meet with the team’s first gold, matching her own school record in long jump. Freshman Simi Fajemisin claimed the second position on the podium, and classmate Zoe Hughes leap only .13 meters less than Fajemisin measuring a distance of 6.14 meters.
Harvard won two more golds on Saturday, the first day of competition. Also in long jump, men’s captain Efe Uwaifo claimed his first ever Outdoor Heps gold medal with a leap of 7.85 meters. Following him, senior Brett Henderson grabbed the team’s final first place medal of the day in javelin. Throwing for a personal best, as well as hitting the second best mark in the program history, Henderson’s third throw measured 68.13 meters.
On the second day of competition, the women’s team dominated their rivals. Senior indoor All-American Nikki Okwelogu got things started for the team. The senior maintained her 2016 title in the shot put, with a toss of 16.45 meters, and claimed her second medal of the weekend, a silver in discus, with a throw 52.55 meters.
Nizdil represented one of the other women in the field, competing in the high jump. The senior, leapt 1.72 meters to claim a gold of her own and was followed by rookie, Fajemisin, picking up another gold in the triple jump.
“I'm very happy I was able to do the most I could have to contribute to the team score,” Nizdil said. “Heps really comes down to day-of performances, and I'm happy to have come through for the girls. It's the best possible way I could have imagined ending my track and field career.”
Four total golds in the field, the women’s team carried their success onto the track. The group led off with first and second in the 100-meter dash, Thomas at first in 11.15 and sophomore Ngozi Musa in 11.39 seconds.
In the 200-meter dash, Thomas claimed another gold. Finishing her trademark event with a time of 22.84, the sophomore maintained her superiority in the sprints.
Freshman distance runner Judy Pendergast ran 15,000 meters total on the weekend, and left two medals to show for it. First competing in the 10,000-meter run, the freshman finished in 34:59.37 to grab a bronze medal. On day two, Pendergast ran the 5,000-meter and finished in second.
Three Crimson runners competed in the finals for the 400-meter hurdles. Senior Jade Miller took the top spot for the quartet, crossing the finish line in 56.95 seconds and nearly two seconds ahead of her closest competitor. The victory is her third Outdoor Heps title in four years. Freshman Karina Joiner and senior Sylvia Deppen finished behind her, in fourth and fifth respectively. Miller also claimed a silver in the 100-meter hurdles with a 13.66 second finish.
From there, it was all relays. Taking gold in two of the three relays, the Harvard women began with the 4x100-meter. The group—Musa, Thomas, Joiner, and Miller—ascended to the top spot in 44.42 seconds setting a new Ivy League record in the process. In the longer variant, the 4x400-meter, the team also finishing first, over two seconds ahead of their closest competitor—Cornell. Running for the group was, freshman Maya Miklos, Joiner, Thomas, and Miller.
Overall, the women’s team would claim the team championship with a program record of 164 total points. The men, would take fourth with 85 points, 39 more than they posted last year.
Following a second place finish in triple jump last year, Uwaifo was back for gold. And that’s exactly what he did. The captain took his second gold of the meet in the field, claiming the triple jump championship with a leap of 16.18 meters, a new personal best. As a result, Uwaifo was named the men’s Most Outstanding Field Performer.
Sophomore Myles Marshall claimed the team’s other gold medal, with a 1:53.77 finish in the 800-meter run.
Freshman Donagh Mahon and Junior Jay Hebert racked up points for the team as well with third place finishes in high jump and the 110-meter hurdles, respectively.
The men’s 4x400-meter relay team—composed of junior James Heckendorn, junior Alexander Moore, freshman Tom Rienas, and junior Matthew Hurst—rounded things out for the Crimson and took second, behind only Yale.
For several, it was last week’s preparation meets with the Penn Relays and the Stonehill Invite that pushed them over the edge competitively.
“This past weekend was an important week for those trying to solidify their spots on the Heps roster,” junior Randy Raymond said. “It was also a good opportunity to get a last bit of competition.”
Next weekend, the qualifying athletes travel to Princeton, where they will compete in the IC4A/ECAC Championships.
“I think I speak for the whole team when I say that we are proud of our hard work and our titles we have earned as product of such work,” Nizdil said. “Four outdoor titles is an astounding feat we are delighted to earn, but we are still hungry for more titles, better marks, and faster times.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the entirety of the 2017 Ivy League softball season, Princeton towered above all other competitors. Breezing through the schedule with a 15-5 conference record, the Tigers only faced significant resistance from Dartmouth, which swept Princeton in a two-game set.
On the other hand, Harvard battled back from a sluggish start to its Ivy slate to ultimately earn a spot in the championship series with a 13-7 league record. Unlike the Tigers, the Crimson had no problem with the Big Green, which it swept in four games to win the North Division.
Though Harvard (22-19, 13-7 Ivy) only trailed Princeton (25-18, 15-5) by two games heading into the weekend of the Ancient Eight championship, the teams’ records did not tell the entire story. In their two meetings in the regular season, the Tigers beat the Crimson by a combined score of 16-4.
Harvard suffered a similar fate on its playoff trip down to Princeton, exiting the Ivy League Championship Series as quickly as it had leapfrogged in over North Division rival Dartmouth.
“I think we had a really good last stretch of games in order to finish where we did,” sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart said. “We battled through a lot of injuries and other things, but we finished strong at the end of the season even if it wasn't the outcome we wanted.”
PRINCETON 13, HARVARD 4
The Crimson dropped the second game on Saturday to close out its season. In the series finale, the Tigers demonstrated the same dominance they did back in early April when they visited Harvard and left with two victories.
“We're all sad and disappointed with our season ending, but this is just going to provide us with that much more motivation to improve ourselves for next season,” sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich said. “I think we know what we need to do collectively to win the championship after these past two years of making it and coming up short.”
This contest was not nearly as much of a battle as the first game, as Princeton jumped out to a 6-0 lead by the fourth inning. Doubles fueled the Tigers’ early offensive attack. In Princeton’s first trip to the plate, first baseman Kaylee Grant doubled down the left field line to drive in two. In the top of the fourth, the Tigers tacked three runs on the board with a pair of RBI doubles.
The Crimson made a comeback bid beginning in the home half of the fourth, and by the end of the fifth Harvard had pulled within two, making it a 6-4 game.
The Crimson’s comeback was led by its two power threats, first baseman Olivia Giaquinto and Lockhart. In the fourth, Giaquinto knocked a solo homer over the center field wall to score Harvard’s first run of the weekend.
Harvard continued to keep the pressure on in the fifth. Junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan drove in junior left fielder Dallas Hogan with a sacrifice fly. With co-captain Giana Panariello on base, Lockhart smoked a two-run homerun to left field. The homers for Giaquinto and Lockhart were the seventh of the season for each player.
“It's great to have Erin and Olivia in the lineup because they've come up clutch with home runs and extra base hits, especially these past two weekends,” Rich said.
However, the Crimson did not maintain the momentum it had gained in the middle innings. Princeton’s offense erupted for seven runs in the sixth and seventh innings, and Tigers reliever Riley Wilkinson shut down Harvard in her two innings of work. Wilkinson struck out two and allowed one walk and no hits.
“They just out hit us and capitalized on their opportunities,” Lockhart said.
PRINCETON 1, HARVARD 0
Despite sophomore lefthander Katie Duncan and the Crimson defense’s success at stranding Princeton on the basepaths, Harvard was unable to get its offense going in a narrow walk-off defeat.
Entering the final frame, the Crimson looked to draw first blood following six innings of staunch pitching and defense from both sides. Hogan led off by punching a single into left field, and two outs later Kaplan advanced Hogan to second with another single. However, Tigers’ pitcher Claire Klausner got out of the inning by inducing a flyout to center field.
After a scoreless top of the seventh, three outs separated Duncan and Harvard from taking the first game of the playoff series to extra innings. The Crimson had worked out of tight situations all game, and the bottom of the seventh was yet another jam.
Second baseman Haley Hineman led off with a single, and third baseman Alex Viscusi drew a walk. A flyout to center marked the first out of the inning, but right fielder Kylee Pierce reached on a fielder’s choice to load up the bases for Princeton’s third hitter.
This time, Harvard was unable to escape the jam. Tigers shortstop Allison Harvey singled into right field to bring home Hineman with the game-winning run, and Princeton took game one of the best-of-three series.
“Pitchers for both teams had very good performances, and they just came up with the timely hit when they needed to,” Lockhart said.
Pitching was clearly the focus of this low-scoring affair. Duncan threw 6.1 innings, struck out five, and only allowed one run. On the Tigers side, Klausner spun a complete game, allowing six hits and three walks while striking out eight.
The Crimson also had several key defensive innings that allowed it to mitigate the threat of seven hits and six walks from Princeton. In the bottom of the first with runners on first and second and two down, Grant singled up the middle, and it seemed all but certain the Tigers would strike first. However, sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer’s throw home beat the runner to keep Princeton off the scoreboard.
“Katie did a really good job hitting her spots on the mound and getting them to hit into outs,” Lockhart said. “When they did get hits and get on base, our defense was really strong and made the plays we needed to hold them throughout the game.”
Aside from the top of the seventh, Harvard had other opportunities to get to Klausner and put runs on the board. Rich and sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively hit leadoff doubles in the first and fifth innings, respectively, but each time the Crimson left runners in scoring position.
“We struggled with timely hitting,” Rich said. “We left 9 people on base so the problem wasn't getting on base, it was hitting those runners in. We hit the ball well the first game, just not at the right times.”
