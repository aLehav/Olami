After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I must admit that I never loved Iliza Shlesinger’s work. She doesn’t have the wit of Norm Macdonald. She doesn’t have the charisma of Deon Cole. She doesn’t have Sarah Silverman’s strokes of unencumbered genius. Shlesinger is funny—never exceptionally so—but funny enough to be a competent, and occasionally thoroughly enjoyable, comic. However, the success that she projects is immense; watching Shlesinger and listening to her audience feels as if one is being indoctrinated into a cult.
There is something unsettling about witnessing a group of people heartily cheering—not laughing—when she speaks, as if she’s a motivational speaker instead of a comic, as if she’s giving a speech rather than a stand-up performance. At a punchline, she’ll sometimes point to the crowd at every word, in the same way that a teacher points to a confused student in a language class, saying each word with the expectation that the student will catch on and join in.
“We tell strong women to bring it down, right. High heels, why do you wear high heels? So you what:  [finger pointed at audience] Can’t. Run. From your attacker. Good.” However, there are problems to this approach. Shlesinger seems to use comedy as a way to instill a certain worldview in her audience—but by approaching comedy in such a didactic, motivational speaker-like manner, she loses the subtlety that is required to endow those values within her audience.
Shlesinger follows a long tradition of individuals who give their audience a perspective on what to think, rather than how to think. I don’t think it is particularly effective; this kind of top down, didactic approach tends to satisfy individuals in the crowd that are already on the intellectual wavelength as the comic, and drowns out the sounds of dissidents with the crowd’s cheers. More importantly, it’s more of an exercise in communal self-satisfaction than comedy. (This is not to say that the points that Shlesinger articulates are universally wrong. Instead, I find fault in the way that she articulates them.)
Take the following joke that seems to peddle in the moderately problematic: “You know who has an unshakable sense of self esteem: black women. [Scattered cheers.] You, yes, you cannot tell a sister on her something isn’t working; she won’t believe it. Try it, go up to a black girl and be like, ‘I don’t like those jeans.’ First of all, I dare you. [Larger cheers.] It will not rattle her for a second.”
Disturbingly, dear reader, the audience is more enthused by “I dare you”—a tag that seems to uncomfortably play off of a fear of black people—rather than the overall message of the bit (that black women are confident). (Tangentially, the popularization of stereotypes is a bit problematic, even if they have a positive valence.) Thus here, when the comic tries to endow the audience with a perspective on what to think (black women are confident), the appropriate value of that perspective is overruled by the prejudices that are already instilled in the audience (black women are to be feared).
Shlesinger is a comic whose currency is cheers rather than laughter—her performance is largely about the vocal affirmation of her world perspective. To construct that world perspective she resorts to reductionism: “Women in our society are vulnerable by virtue of the fact that we are physically not as strong as men. That’s the root of the issue. That’s the root of the oppression. And that’s the root of oppression for any side of war throughout history at any point in time.” I am sure that Shlesinger is more intelligent than that perspective implies; I am sure that she understands that the origins of inequality are more multifaceted than issues of physical strength; I am sure that she realizes that totalizing statements are antithetic to actual thought.
However, crafting a performance that didactically tells the audience what to think occasionally requires reducing complex issues into digestible chunks. I don’t think that this is helpful to anyone other than the comic who needs the audience’s affirmation—which Shlesinger receives through cheers, not laughter. Moreover, as with Shlesinger’s aside on black women, it can easily be derailed by the unfortunate pieces of prejudice that the audience clings onto.
But sometimes the fault lies with Shlesinger, “I don’t care cause I’m going to lay out on the beach like a mermaid. No you won’t. Sailors are going to try to fuck you and the Japanese will definitely try to eat you, like, just for funsies. [Scattered laughs. Louder cheers.]” I would rather not explain the joke. I believe that we are both competent enough to understand where the bit goes wrong. However, that is not to condemn Shlesinger completely—“Confirmed Kills” is not a special that is undermined consistently by uncomfortable racial undertones.
I do not want to reduce Shlesinger’s comedy to a series of moderately problematic asides. That would not be fair to Shlesinger, nor would it be fair to you, dear reader. However, I do think that it is reasonable to talk about Shlesinger’s special in the terms that her audience reacts to her with—largely in cheers.
I believe that this is a sonic mark of improperly formed comedy. At its best, comedy should challenge you to think—comedy should challenge the way that you, kind reader, approach life. Cheers represent something undeniably different: They are a representation of an instant recognition and affirmation of another’s ideas. They represent an idea that does not challenge you—instead, they are the reaction to an already agreed-upon ideal.
Yes, comedy can be a space for affirmation, but comedy that does not challenge you is, in my mind, a lower form of art. “We showed up, got a trophy for breathing, and then we invented Instagram. [Scattered laughter. Louder cheers. Sustained applause.]” The joke is millennials, cheering at generational self-deprecation, and affirming the importance of our generational technology. Cheering is a sign of unrealized creativity. The audience is already on the same page as the comic, they just want to vocalize their agreement. It is, in other words, an affirmation of the perspective of the comic, and a simultaneous affirmation of the audience’s own perspective and prejudices. It’s a bizarre form of narcissism.
Don’t cheer, dear reader.
Laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have always been a bit ambivalent about Maria Bamford’s comedy. In many ways, she fits what I have prescribed (while I hope not programmatically) as the paradigm of “good” comedy. In her best moments she reminds us of the creative potential of the human mind. She’s beyond ambitious as well: her television series, “Lady Dynamite,” is genre breaking, fascinatingly meta-theatrical, and maddeningly inconsistent; her special, “Old Baby,” is equally genre breaking (all the more impressive for standup) and oscillates between brilliant and unfortunate. It’s the comedy equivalent of Kanye West’s “Yeezus.”
At least Bamford is humble enough to acknowledge how polarizing her comedy can be, “I always like to tell audiences preprogram—just in case you were brought here by a friend—sometimes friends lead us astray. I had two very close friends, my parents, invite me to go see a film, I said, ‘of course I’ll go see that movie with you,’ because you love me, why on earth would you want to see me suffer? And then I sat through Steven Spielberg’s ‘War Horse,’ which if you haven’t seen, as far as I’m concerned, is a 14 hour, real time documentary about a gentle horse struggling, in vain, to escape from barbed wire. This may be your ‘War Horse.’”
I do not know if she is entirely correct. “Old Baby” is like watching “War Horse,” intermittently spliced with footage of a better, more thoughtful, less mind-numbingly empty film. I hope that this reaction is not simply the manifestation of inconsistent comic taste on my behalf. Instead, I would argue that Bamford’s special is emblematic of something fascinating: the inconsistent artistic merit of artistic ambition.
I have tossed around phrases like “ambitious” and “genre breaking” without, perhaps, explaining myself. “Old Baby” transcends a fixed location; its 64 minutes are filmed in front of increasingly large crowds at increasingly traditional venues. The opening monologue, quoted above, is performed while Bamford banters into a mirror. She proceeds to perform (in ascending, non-inclusive order) in front of her husband and two dogs, a small bookstore, a medium sized bowling alley, and finally, a fully filled theater. Interspersed throughout are bizarre scenes featuring Bamford attempting to sell merchandise.
Her approach towards location is aggressively original. It works, dear reader, because it isn’t originality for originality’s sake—instead, it’s a device that lets Bamford illuminate the way in which the audience, not only the performer, crafts stand-up.
In the small opening venues hosting her performance, it sounds as if Bamford is bombing. It is a bit horrifying to watch, but it serves a purpose: As the crowd size increases and the laughs become more frequent (her material and delivery is not radically different throughout), Bamford shows the power of community. It is easier to laugh along with someone, amused reader, than by yourself.
You experience that concept emotionally—from the sheer discomfort of the opening minutes to the later patches of comic brilliance. It’s not an illustration or an idea sterilized on a page. Bamford constructs her thesis—not by telling you about the power of community, but by making you viscerally experience it as an observer. One feels less alone when laughing at her later jokes when laughing along with her recorded audience.
She doesn’t confine this idea to the structure of her special. The closing moments of her special feature her, against her largest audience, trying to make them play “One Big Blob,” a game in which each individual catches the hand of the next individual until everyone is entrapped in the titular blob, rhythmically screaming “one big blob” in unison. She prefaces it by saying, “I’m trying to believe in something [...] something more bigger than myself. And I just, I just can’t, can’t think of anything. But then I remember that there was this game we used to play when we were kids and it's called ‘One Big Blob.’”
That “something bigger” for Bamford is the community of laughs—the scene of a theater full of individuals holding each other’s hands laughing and chanting. (I, however, cannot help but feel the opposite. There is something isolating about witnessing a community that you are not a part of hold hands and chant in unison.) The aesthetic brilliance of Bamford is in the fact that she crafts her theme by unifying form and content; her ideology of a community of laughs is crafted though her approach towards location and the literal language of her speech (as she says, believing in “something more bigger”).
However, even though so much of “Old Baby” is intellectually rationalizable, I can’t shake the feeling that it is oftentimes not particularly good. One must not confuse what is innovative with what is good. More precisely, one must not let innovation obfuscate badness.
If you will excuse my elementary division between “good” and “bad”—a division that critics are too often reticent to make out of some misinformed sense of writing with “complexity” and “nuance”—it appears that Bamford too often uses innovations in form to obscure her bad bits. A large portion of her show is impressions; only some of them are good and only some of them make sense: “[Imitating an unknown sad voice] How do you make it in show business? Do you move to San Diego and disguise yourself as a bush? Moving slowly northward, underneath the cover of dusk.” If I may quote one of Bamford’s fellow comics, “Aren’t you even writing anymore?”
Her closing bit, rolling around on the ground while making fart noises, is the comic equivalent of West’s, “How much do I not give a fuck? / Let me show you right now ‘fore you give it up” (“On Sight” from “Yeezus”). The difference is that for West, “not giv[ing] a fuck” one of the central themes in “Yeezus”; for Bamford, it’s a cheap distraction and an unexplored idea.
The thing about innovation, about creativity, is that it needs to enhance the craft. Bamford occasionally uses it as a way to enhance her thematics by providing a unity between form and content. She occasionally uses innovation as a way of masking the worst parts of her comedy. But most damning of all, dear reader, is that she sometimes innovates for the sake of innovating. Her interspersed cuts of scenes of her selling merchandise are unworthy of your time.
I do not want to come across as an intellectual utilitarian—I am not saying that innovation only has a place if it furthers some abstract intellectual thought. Instead, Bamford’s innovation only has merit in the moments when it enhances her comedic message, rather than distracting from temporary bouts of laziness.
So, if I may conclude with a plea, please gentle reader, do not judge art on if it is different or not—judge it its difference on if it contributes anything to the larger whole of the art. Please be thoughtful. Think not of what art is, but of what it does.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“columbinus” shines light on one dark underside of modern American history: high school shootings. Directed by Derek P. Speedy ’18, this play will run at Farkas Hall from Dec. 1 to 3 and explores the potential for teen cruelty and its consequences through a number of high school archetypes. From the stereotypical jock to the unheralded nerd, the play’s first act dramatizes the social dynamics of high school life and their effects upon the teenage psyche.
The second act takes a turn as it proceeds to retell the events leading to the 1996 Columbine High School massacre, one of the deadliest and most notorious school shootings in U.S. history. With gun violence as pressing an issue as ever in the United States, Producer David J. Lynch ’20 says, “Harvard’s theater community has acknowledged that ‘columbinus’ is one of the hardest shows to ever come here.”
Usually a musical actor, Speedy undertakes his first full-scale directorial role in “columbinus” for his senior thesis for Theater, Dance & Media. After reading the play after his freshman year, Speedy says that he was enthralled by its intensity. Speedy says that the play demands that both director and audience ask difficult questions: “How do we deal with the fact that this show is not only about real people who were killed, but real people who were killed in a way that is extremely relevant in our time?”
Actors Max H. W. Burkholder ’21 and Henry R. Lynch ’20 portray the real-life teen killers, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, respectively. They recognize that Speedy’s direction has allowed them to carefully navigate the thin line between recreation and romanticization in their acting. “We’re very much trying to show who [Klebold and Harris] were as people, but we’re not in any way trying to justify or lessen the horrific things that they did,” Burkholder says. The actors emphasize that the show is not about shocking the audience, but about initiating a conversation about the issues that ultimately led to the Columbine massacre.
“columbinus” hopes to be an intense but respectful retelling of one of the darkest moments in American history.

2018 will vault us firmly into the long-awaited and highly-anticipated next era: the Postdigital Age. In apocalyptic fashion, millennials ridden with Apple Watch anxiety and social-media-posing muscle spasms will band together to give up their gadgets for good, with Urban Outfitters, naturally, in the vanguard. You won’t need your smartphone when all your music is made on vinyl and all your photos are Polaroids.
But are you, Harvard student, really prepared for this cataclysmic cultural shift? Once you’ve tossed your Google Glass and portable drone under your bed (to be stored for the Prepostdigitaltranshumanism Age) you’ll need to be properly equipped for your unplugged life. You’ll need the healing power of crystals.
You might think the crystal thing is just another one of those overpriced vegan Los Angeles trends. Well, so was kale, and now it’s impossible to avoid. So we’ve compiled the most relevant crystal tips to help the Harvard student assimilate.
1. Obtaining your crystals. 
Healing crystals are no regular rocks. Don’t try digging for these precious stones at Mt. Auburn Cemetery. You’ll need to purchase your crystals online at a certified metaphysical shop, preferably in Brooklyn. Rocks aren’t light, so be prepared to shell out for shipping. Some non-peer-reviewed studies show that the more money you spend on your crystals, the more healing energy they radiate.
2. Which crystals are right for you.
You could spend hours browsing the internet trying to find your perfect crystal match. We’ve done the work for you and selected the stones most relevant for the Harvard student. Amethyst is known as “The Artist’s Stone.” You should get some of these in preparation for meeting up with all of your artsiest friends. Grip this, tightly, in your pocket during those conversations, and you just might radiate with genius theories about post-painterly abstraction. Tiffany Stone is known as “The Stone of Mental Sharpness.” Instead of studying for your final, buy a ton of these and press them against your forehead. Finally, Clear Fluorite is “The Crystal of New Perspective.” Gently toss this stone at anyone who doesn’t agree with your argument.
3. Getting your crystals past the Widener metal detector.
Keep a few handouts on you at all times explaining the very real scientific and metaphysical basis for your crystals’ powers. Whenever people give you a hard time for lugging “those weird rocks” around, you’ll have the pleasure of enlightening a future crystal carrier.
4. Crystals in the classroom. 
Crystals may not be on the official list of sanctioned academic accommodations, but odds are high that that will change pretty soon. You might find it helpful, for example, to bring Blue Chalcedony, “The Speaker’s Stone,” with you to your next class presentation. It’s obviously difficult to simultaneously carry your crystal and switch between slides on a PowerPoint, but duct-taping this crystal to your upper body while speaking should work just as well.
5. Crystal as decor. 
Your crystals should be displayed as prominently as possible in your bedroom. This will not only make for ideal energy radiance, but also for ideal advertisement value. If you’re spending that much money on colorful rocks, everyone better know it.
—Rebecca H. Dolan is the outgoing Campus Arts exec. She has decided to study abroad in London next semester, in order to further distance herself from the influence of Los Angeles vegan culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I comped Crimson Arts my freshman fall, I got a glimpse of casual college beer at the first comp seminar I attended: Pabst Blue Ribbon. The near emblem of the Arts board, it was the holy grail I thought I’d savor throughout my tenure as a writer and editor. Chugging is so fun, the upperclassmen said. God’s piss, the Germans call it. Lies. PBR is objectively just actual piss. When I went to Germany this past Thanksgiving, I experienced the beer I never thought I could. As the outgoing Comp Director, I’d like to spare the future of Crimson Arts the treachery that I myself suffered. It’s true, drinking PBR has been a tradition that the “fringe” boards of the Crimson—shoutout to Sports—have enjoyed for years, but as Lemony Snicket once said, “Just because something is traditional is no reason to do it, of course.” Herein, I propose five beer alternatives to PBR. Prost!
5. Pilsner
The Pilsner beer, like the incoming Arts executives, has not been around as long as its predecessors, but it’s here to stay. The most popular brew in the world, the Pilsner is often served with the spiciest of foods to soothe the hottest of burns—and, as such, would be very well served to the Arts board, especially considering how the Crimson is at risk from the fire that is Crimson Arts.
4. Ayinger
The most fruity of the bunch, the Ayinger is intoxicating in its tanginess. Drink it slowly to savor it, for some say its potency can be debilitating. Ayinger brings out dark truths from its victims. See, for example, Aziz B. Yakub’s opinions on literally anything, formed only after drinking a couple pints of Ayinger. As my fellow ayingerites would say, aaaaaayee!
3. Spaten
You may have just missed Oktoberfest in Munich, but fear not, because certain brews of this beer are available year-round, as is Arts. Be careful not indulge too much, though! After all, as the saying goes, too much of a good thing can be bad… Or was it wonderful? Regardless, best to enjoy Spaten beers sparingly, just like the rest of the world enjoys Crimson Arts (I mean, 4% of readership, guys? Really?)
2. Augustiner
One of, if not the, best beers in the world, the Augustiner is just the right blend of bitterness and zest—just like our board! Do we willingly accept our “fringe” board status? I suppose. Do we have an unhealthily enthusiastic relationship with Shrek? Perhaps. Never forget: you can’t spell Augustiner without Arts.
1. Kinderbier
Come on, now. Did you really think I would endorse the consumption of alcohol by the young’uns of the Harvard Crimson? That’s illegal! Kinderbier—alcohol-free children’s beer—is clearly the only possible option. With Kinderbier, let us prepare our youth for the harsh world they will invariably face: a world in which they will likely be drinking the worst beer, Pabst Blue Ribbon.
—Staff writer Mila Gauvin II is the outgoing Books Executive and Comp Director, and incoming Arts Chair, though based off of this nonsense, her credibility is seriously in question. She clearly cannot objectively be objective, so ignore this unwarranted spiel. Please instead reach out to her much more trustworthy co-Chair, Grace Z. Li, at grace.li@thecrimson.com.

But the solar system is made up of planets! You’re not wrong. But I’m talking about living, breathing, talking stars, particularly the ones who made their mark in 2017 and have some striking similarities with our galaxy’s planets. Whether they were a one-hit wonder or made a long-awaited comeback, the following stars deserve recognition.
Mercury: Millie Bobby Brown
Mercury may be the smallest planet, but in no way should it be underestimated. Similarly, Millie Bobby Brown has proved herself a force to be reckoned with at the age of 13. She’s an Emmy-nominated actress, fashion icon, and the star of Netflix’s most successful show. She has even co-hosted an event for UNICEF. (Essentially, this is me giving my place at Harvard to Millie.)
Venus: Kesha
Kesha, how we’ve missed you. You re-entered the music scene without the dollar sign in your name, but like Venus, you’re still as fiery but full of love as ever. You’ve channelled your glitter obsession into gritty song, championing resilience in the process. Two words: Go you.
Earth: Danielle Bregoli
Memes ruled yet another year on Earth. And one of our superstars, Danielle Bregoli, made her famous debut with a very taken aback Dr. Phil (and woefully indignant mother). Lucky for us, she’s given us a response to just about anything. Don’t agree? Cash me ousside, howbow dah.
Mars: Cardi B
We’ve been following the iconic Cardi B on social media for awhile, but no one expected her to pull off one of the most successful singles of the year. “Bodak Yellow” was a diverting, unifying escape from this year of chaos—almost like a visit to Mars would be. Will she bless us with another musical haven? Either way, she finished 2017 with a bang(er).
Jupiter: Kim Kardashian West
We get it: You’re the biggest planet. You basically own “the system.” “The system” is your famous, bronzed family. You also married a pretty famous rapper. And have two (soon to be three) beautiful children, plus a makeup line. People name workouts after you. Ugh. Stop hogging the attention.
Saturn: Miley Cyrus
You’ve been with us for awhile. In fact, many of us don’t remember life without you. You might’ve gyrated your rings a little too enthusiastically in 2013, but we always knew you’d be back. “Malibu” brought us back to Hannah Montana-era Miley, and we just about cried hearing your voice again.
Uranus: Taylor Swift
You’re the butt of every solar system joke. You can try to redeem yourself with new takes on pop music and pseudo-deep music videos, but in the end, no one wants to explore Uranus. Stop trying.
Neptune: Gal Gadot
Thank you for showing us that strength can be simultaneously intimidating and strikingly beautiful. I’m no doubt very scared of ever encountering you because I’ll be a small, mushy human in comparison, but Gal Gadot, you’re Wonder Woman on and off screen.
Pluto: Jelena
Wait, is Pluto relevant anymore? Just when you think it’s officially in the past, we’ll see photos of it, new or old, that put us in a nostalgic swoon. In this way Pluto is the most divisive of the planets, setting off debates against and in support of it—just like America’s most followed couple, Jelena. (They are back together again, right?)

— Kaylee S. Kim is the outgoing Theater Executive and incoming Editor-at-Large and co-comp director. For someone who “doesn’t listen to pop music,” she has an unhealthy obsession with “Shape of You.” She incidentally chose all female stars for this article (here’s to internalized anti-patriarchism?).

Disclaimer: The only people who were qualified to write this did not. Some of this was personal vendetta, some of it still is, but all of it is real. Just like astrological signs.
Pisces: Trevor J. LevinLike all Pisces, Trevor Levin (née Manbun) is a sensitive young man who is passionate about theater playing his guitar, and cooking extravagant feasts of PBR, his favourite beer. When he used to have long flowing locks like Jesus, people mistook him for a professional flutist or Napoleon Dynamite in that ice skating movie. Now that he doesn’t have long hair, he is neither. Trevor may be a fish, but he is a dreamer: JUST look at his vintage Fleetwood Mac t-shirt.
Capricorn: Grace Z. LiHardworking, vigilant, steadfast—Grace Li fits all of the above. Grace, or “Mountainous Goat” as we call her at The Crimson, is a natural born leader. Don’t be surprised to learn that Grace is the prime example of Capricorns because she is an actual goat—beautiful, gleaming horns and all. Listen to her discuss Bronte literature or poetry and you will be amazed not only at her insight, but also at her ability to talk. She is an animal, after all. If you happen to run into her, feel free to feed her stolen Lamont textbooks.
Cancer: J. Thomas WestbrookIs he J? Is he Thomas? What does the J even stand for?  In truth, we will never know.  Like all Cancers, Thomas is good at walking side-to-side. He loves cooking shows and sushi, which is ironic because CANCERS are crabs. Though CANCERS are known for their clinginess and hypersensitivity, Thomas has none of that. He is a Kant man through and through, mainly because he reads Kant. That’s not him over there crying over his imminent departure from Harvard. No really, that isn’t him. That’s Aziz.
Aquarius: Kaylee S. KimKaylee Kim, the girl with the glass of water. Kaylee is the ultimate babe of the zodiac signs and of the Arts Board—cool, calm, and free spirited. Don’t mistake her stony silence and ice cold stares for misanthropy—it’s called independence. She’s the true hippie of the board and not just because of the flared jeans or her love of ~theatre~, but because she plays the wokest instrument, which is obviously the cello. Did someone say “shaka khan?”
Taurus: Mila Gauvin IIAnother editor with a mysterious name. Everytime we see her names, the question arises: who is Mila Gauvin I? Mila is tough, stubborn, and does everything she puts her mind to, like all Taurus. Besides her incredible work ethic and perseverance, Mila has another great Taurus quality: a fantastic appetite. You might think this is a joke about her being a great Books editor with a voracious appetite, but it’s not. This is a real warning. Don’t go to Cabot Brain Break after Mila has gone. There will be nothing left.

Scorpio: Petra Laura OreskovicYou might think that Petra is just a Croatian writer, editor, and student, but that isn’t true. She is also Slovenian. Like the stereotypical Scorpio, Petra is passionate. Particularly about her indie music. If it is a song that sounds like a Mario Kart video game and has more than three foreign characters, then it has to be “mad good.” Petra also has a strong passion for The Economist, Paris Hilton, long showers, and Slavic Squats.

Gemini: Aline G. DamasThe stereotype for Geminis is that they’re two-faced. Aline, the overachiever she is, goes beyond that—she actually has a split personality disorder. After 10 p.m. every night, the kombucha-brewing, oil-pulling, Jane-Austen-reading Aline is gone, and Gigi comes alive. Gigi will burn your Chinese textbook, your marshmallows, and especially your kale, because she only eats carbs. However, she will not burn down the Pfoho Jordans, mainly because she wants to live there again next year.
Sagittarius: Tianxing V. LanLike any Sagittarius, Vincent is brutally honest. The outgoing film exec will say it as it is, especially if your movie is bad, is not inspired by French post-structuralism, or just so happens to be called “The Neon Demon.” However, not even the stars can reveal what he actually thinks about “Shrek.” His flowing long coat and the magic he works with words might remind you of a Harry Potter wizard, but that reference is probably too lowbrow for Vincent. He is actually much more like Guillaume in Godard’s “La Chinoise,” thank you very much.
Leo: Elizabeth C. KetoElizabeth, the king of the jungle. Grace may be a goat, but her predecessor Elizabeth is the GOAT (and a fierce lioness). It’s not only her fiery red mane that makes her the ruler of the group of monkeys that is the Arts Board (and an occasional member of the Bovidae family—does anyone really know what the difference between Aries and Capricorns is?). It’s also that she will literally rip you to pieces and eat you if you resort to “Shrek” as your answer again. We’re pretty sure Elizabeth is a feminist, though, so down with the patriarchal “king” part. She is our queen.
Virgo: Noah F. HoughtonBeep, beep, who got the keys to the jeep? Not Noah Houghton, but he does have his scooter and it does go VROOOOOOM. Missy Elliott aside, Virgos love practicality, and what is more practical than a scooter? Nothing. So, VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.
Aries: Caroline A. TsaiThere is nothing Aries dislike more than inactivity, and there is nothing Caroline dislikes more than Snapchat inactivity. Do not watch her stories if you’re not connected to WiFi, because it will eat up all your data. And eat up is the appropriate phrase here, as one of Caroline’s excellent qualities is that, much like Gigi, she definitely eats crabs (Not J. Thomas! The only cannibalism we will tolerate is Elizabeth’s … and maybe J. Thomas’ if he wants to eat himself in a nice uramaki roll). Oh not crabs, carbs!
Libra: Aziz B. YakubHonestly, like any Libra, Aziz is actually super nice, so can we just leave him out of this zodiac B.S.? We are not trying to get revenge on him (just him, though) through this.
—Aline G. Damas is the incoming Theatre Arts executive. Her roommate is not Petra, but Gigi. In spite of what is written here, she is a (Belgian) Scorpio with a passion for Literature, Martha Stewart, and Fate. For questions about any of these subjects, including Belgium, you can reach her through telepathy (codeword: Martha).
—Petra Laura Oreskovic is the incoming Campus Arts executive and Aline’s roommate. In spite of what is written here, she is actually a (multi-national) Cancer with a passion for throwing remnants of clay face masks down the Jordans sink while listening to Charli XCX’s feminist anthem “Boys”. For questions about skincare or living with a roommate who won’t stop making kefir in your room. Do not contact her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before you ask, the rumors are all true. I did fall in love with Joe Alwyn, Hollywood’s forty-third hottest man-child. Sure, his looks fall short of Jake Gyllenhaal and Calvin Harris. And okay, he doesn’t carry the social media relevance of Tom Hiddleston or Harry Styles. Yeah, he does some annoying stuff, like how he freaks out whenever I drop more than $15,000 on Chanel dresses or pay to landscape my four houses. He’s like, “Whoa, Tay, how can you justify paying two-thirds of my net worth on one rare Japanese shrub?” and I’m like, “Oh, Joe, you’re so cute! Will you run away with me?” and he’s like, “Didn’t we do that last weekend?” and I’m like, “Okay, but that was the second house, and I haven’t seen Number Four in a while. I just wanna make sure the upstairs Jacuzzi hasn’t gotten gross."
Our love story will go down in history, like Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, or Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber—one of those classic, Old Hollywood romances.
You want to know where it all started. Let me paint you a scene: dive bar on the East Side. Everybody was staring at me. I don’t know why, because I was wearing my disguise: a fake mustache, bleached dreadlocks, and a sumo wrestler fat suit. If only I weren’t so damn recognizable! Fame is exhausting.
Anyway, he walked in: average height, average build, possibly the blandest face I have ever seen. It was love at first sight. My hands were shaking. “Oh my gosh,” I whispered to Meredith, my cat. She’s a great listener. “I gotta have him, Mer. He looks like a freakin’ TJ Maxx model.”
He motioned to the bartender. Nervous, I felt my fat suit deflate a little.
“I’ll have what he’s having,” I whispered to the bartender, who set down a glass. I took a sip and coughed: Capri Sun Fruit Explosion. I giggled flirtatiously, touching my lip (my fake mustache was kind of falling off). “Have I seen you before?”
“I was just in a movie,” he said.
OMG, he had a British accent! “‘I was just in a movie,’” I mocked his accent drunkenly. “You should take that as a compliment, by the way. What movie?”
“Does it matter?” he said seductively, in a way that suggested the movie did not perform that well at the box office or garner critical acclaim. “I might not have a Range Rover or Jaguar. I might look like an untoasted slice of Wonder bread. But I promise I’ll love you, and take care of you in my modest home in the English countryside.”
Reader, I married him. By that, I mean I wear his initial on a necklace. Not because he owns me, but because he knows me. #Feminism.
I know what you’re thinking. He should be enough for me… but he’s not. That’s why I’ve been penning anonymous poems and posting them under a pseudonym on articles about me. I may have ten Grammys, but all I want is the Napatree Sand Dollar Award. Although ostensibly fictional, it’s the most selective award ever—no one has EVER won it, which is why I must. After all, love may be fleeting, but Reputation is forever.

There comes a time in every galaxy’s life, as the impending heat-death of the universe edges ever closer, when a young set of stars and large spherical masses might look around and start to think, “Hey, those are some pretty nice giant balls of flaming gas which surround me in this dark matter sea. Maybe I should look at them and, perhaps, compare them to each other by some arbitrary scale.” This writer has looked into the abyss and found the following list staring back at him, a set of arbitrary classifications in an arbitrary order, spinning forever in an arbitrary universe.
5. Betelgeuse
I don’t really know her that well, but Betelgeuse seems like a pretty cool cat. I mean, she’s a red supergiant, so she’s pretty damn hot, but there’s just something about her, you know? She shines so bright that you can’t help but be like, “Whoa, what’s going on over there?” She’s making waves—last I heard, she was part of that cool new band “Orion’s Belt.” Overall, just a quality star.
4. Rigel
Betelgeuse’s super dreamy older sibling, he’s even brighter than his sister and the brightest star in Orion. What a catch! Though he can be outshone when his sister flares up, Rigel is consistently just a comforting presence in the night sky. Rigel was there when the controversial “DAMN.” review was published, and he will be there in 2417 when it will be entered into the Cosmic Vault of Controversies. He’s always been an unimaginably hot shoulder to lean towards from a safe distance, and he always will be. Good job, Rigel.
3. The Sun
You didn’t think I’d be so vain as to put our Sun, a fairly unremarkable star in the grand scheme of the cosmos, at number one, did you? Sure, it’s the only reason any of us exist, and so far as we know is the only star around which orbits life, let alone intelligent life. And yeah, maybe we’d all die within minutes if the Sun were to go out. The Sun has been a real champ for the last few billion years, and we owe it a huge debt. Still, would love to see a stronger showing in the winter months. Just saying, Sun.
2. Tommy Wiseau
Now we get to the real meat of the pie, the real catcher in the rye, the real big man on campus. Thomas Wiseau, writer, producer, director, and star of his 2003 film “The Room,” is a true star. Little is known about this man other than his truly stellar critique of American film stereotypes and that he likes to ask his friends about their sex lives in coffee shops. Is this reference niche enough to drive you away yet? No? Then read on, dear viewer, for the starriest star who ever did star.
1. You
You’re a pretty incredible person, you know that? You took time out of your day, or evening, or whenever you’re reading this, to look over a few hundred words about stars. You may have laughed at the predictable joke of rating actual stars, a tired play on the shared word for celestial bodies and cultural icons. You may even have enjoyed the quick departure from physical stars to include an obscure reference to an obscure film. Even if you didn’t enjoy those parts, I thank you, brightest light of my life, for taking the time to read to the end. You bring joy to my life, and to all those around you. Keep on shining, you star you.
—Incoming Blog Exec Noah F. “Scoots McGoots” Houghton '20 can be seen only in flashes as he speeds along the ground at Mach 3, leaving hapless pedestrians in the dust. He hopes to one day scoot quickly enough to convert his entire body mass into light and energy.

We all know by now that being Damien Chazelle '07 sounds pretty good. Maybe his last film didn’t win Best Picture, but he’s still the youngest person ever to win Best Director! And why shouldn’t he be? After all, he went to Harvard.
But now, us Harvard students interested in the world of film are in a tough bind: which of our many successful exemplars of Harvard alums in the film business should we follow? For some, this is a tough choice. You could go the straight acting route, à la Natalie Portman '03, Tommy Lee Jones '69, or Jack Lemmon '47. You could join the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, and go on into the world of White Guy Comedy™ like B.J. Novak '01, Colin Jost '04, or Conan O’Brien '85. You could even try to pull a Matt Damon (who left the college in '92) and get famous enough that you can just drop out!
You, however, are special. You’re not interested in acting, it’s just having other people tell you what to do. You never comped the Lampoon, claiming you disapproved of it, but really just scared of getting cut. And let’s be honest, you’re having a hard enough time making it through finals already without trying to write an Oscar–winning screenplay on top of it. Instead, you have chosen the ultimate path of Harvard graduate: to become a true filmmaker.
Terrence Malick '66 did it. Darren Aronofsky '91 did it. And now, Damien Chazelle has done it as well. Why not you too? You can make deeply philosophical films, like Malick, or psychological films, like Aronofsky, or even jazz films, like Chazelle! Malick’s use of sunlight and voiceover, Aronofsky’s of close-ups and controversy, and Chazelle’s use of jazz—all these have been influential in the film world. With some hard work and dedication, you too could make such an impact!
Besides, doesn’t it all come down to hard work and dedication? Just look at “The Wrestler,” Aronofsky’s film about a wrestler who sacrifices his health and personal relationships for the chance at greatness and glory. Or look at “Whiplash,” Chazelle’s film about a drummer who sacrifices his health and personal relationships for the chance at greatness and glory. Or even “Black Swan,” Aronofsky’s film about a ballerina who sacrifices her health and personal relationships for the chance at greatness and glory. It doesn’t have to be as grim as all that, however: your life could just end up like “La La Land,” Chazelle’s film about an actress and a jazz musician who merely sacrifice their personal relationships for the chance at greatness and glory.
Believe me, though: that greatness and glory is worth it. Like I was saying, being Damien Chazelle is great! He’s probably rolling in cash, and he has a whole separate Wikipedia page for his list of awards and nominations! And you can be just like him. Just make some really talented friends, write about their minor struggles, and add a snazzy soundtrack. You can get away with a lot when you save jazz.
—Ethan B. Reichsman is the Incoming TV Executive and is hoping that Mr. Chazelle and Mr. Aronofsky will recognize this piece as a loving jab at two incredible alumni, and therefore not blackball him in Hollywood. Hate mail can reach him at ethan.reichsman@thecrimson.com.

Art is really obsessed with lords: literary lords, music lords, lords who are equally infatuated with fire as we are with them. And as media evolves from monumental frescoes to clickbait listicles, it only felt natural to give these lords the platform they deserve: a top five ranking.
5. The Lord of LightAt the bottom of this list is R'hllor, alternatively titled as the Red God, the Heart of Fire, and the God of Flame and Shadow. If these many names don’t already make it apparent, the Lord of Light has a thing for flames. This “Game of Thrones” deity makes it to the bottom of our list, mainly because he has a tendency to encourage his followers to burn children alive.
4. Lord and Taylor65% off of clearance! 50% off of handbags! 40% off of apparel! Fashion at incredible prices! Sign up with your email today to receive 15% off your next order. Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored post by Lord and Taylor.
3. The Lord of the Rings63 years after the first volume’s publication, J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic fantasy trilogy has manifested itself in movies, video games, and some pretty high-quality “My Precious!!!” memes. We’re excited to see where this particular “Lord” is going to go in another 63 years. Maybe a virtual-reality immersive experience of the Elven realms? A cooking-show spinoff inspired by all the great battles? The possibilities are limitless. In the wise words of Gandalf: “63 MORE YEARS!!”
2. LordeAlso known as Ella Yelich-O'Connor, this New Zealander pop artist has made a big splash on American airwaves as everyone’s favorite suburban philosopher. Her sophomore album—Melodrama—stands at 91 points on Metacritic, and deservedly so. Incoming Theater exec Aline G. Damas ’20 called it “painfully relatable” with “sophisticated lyrics and distinctive electronic sound.” I call it an accurate representation of the fading glamour of maturation and drinking culture. Or in other words: sad...but fun!
1. GodYes, as in Him. I’m probably putting this at the top of my list because I’m afraid that the ghosts of all Sunday School teachers will send bolts of lightning after me, but God has been pretty influential among works of art and Western literature. Some particularly notable pieces include: “The Creation of Adam,” “Paradise Lost,” and “Bruce Almighty.” He’s also responsible for the Bible, which is long but fairly popular, making guest appearances in the bedside drawers of hotels, fast food packaging, and my high school’s AP Literature class. The Lord’s most influential work gets 4.5 out of 5 stars. Flawed, but compelling.

My third grade English teacher’s favorite piece of advice to us youngsters was always, “Write what you know.” Unfortunately, third graders don’t know a whole lot, and it remains an object of intense fascination for me how Mrs. Atkins managed to survive an entire year of compositions entitled “My Puppy” and “My Dream Puppy” and “The Dog That I Made Out of Paper Clips and Hot Glue and Then Played With Forlornly to Guilt My Parents into Getting Us a Puppy.” So no, please don’t write what you know. At least, not if you’re in the third grade.
But what do we know, really? To quote a favorite childhood book of mine, “I expect what you’re not aware of would fill several books, Dursley.” That’s just the point. We can’t imagine what we don’t know, and we know far less than we think we do. What I personally don’t know would of course fill numerous books, definitely more than several. The bad news is that if the last year or so has taught us anything, it’s that you really don’t need to know anything at all about a thing in order to write about it, make legislation about it, or issue executive orders about it. (It’s fine! We’re all fine!) But the good news is that there isn’t just one way to write about what you don’t know. There’s spouting arrogant nonsense, and then there’s genuinely seeking to understand.
So acknowledge what you don’t know, and direct your gaze toward the uncertain. Be humble. Travel. Read. Lose track of time talking to a friend. Listen. Do something stupid, and admit your mistake. Do it differently the next time, and be proud of what you’ve achieved. Stay up late, or wake up to see the sunrise. Or both. It doesn’t matter, honestly. Do things for which you don’t yet have the words.
Let your language always be playing catch-up to your life. Write down even the clumsiest sentences, the most hackneyed phrases, the most clichéd words. And don’t worry if the words get stuck in your throat and your fingers hover motionless over the keyboard. My own favorite poet, whose book of letters my brilliant senior year English teacher gave to me as a graduation gift, wrote that “Things aren't all so tangible and sayable as people would usually have us believe; most experiences are unsayable, they happen in a space that no word has ever entered… ”
These days, it can be easy to think that words are cheap. Meaningless. That a denial is an apology, or that guilt exists on both sides. That anyone can say anything, and no one cares. I don’t believe that, nor do I think that was what Rainer Maria Rilke meant when he described experience as “unsayable.” I think what he meant was that it’s difficult to build bridges between the armed camps that are our particular and personal minds. The effort to do so is all the more heroic for that.
So write. Write for all you’re worth. Write spectacularly, with the force of everything you’ve ever wanted to know.

In this wondrous age of communication into which we have entered, the critic has become as susceptible to criticism as the artist. In light of this expansion of intelligent discussion to the masses, I—your gentle critic—will enter into the rich historical tradition of responding to one’s critics. The following comments, compiled from Reddit, Facebook, and the comment section of The Harvard Crimson, are thematically organized, all in response to my two-star review of “DAMN.”—widely thought of as two stars too few (from my perspective, half a star too low). Some are presented without comment, for their merit stands on their own. Others are presented with editorial comments in brackets. I can only hope that these comments form a historical document—a lesson to anyone stricken with the scourge of independent thought: don’t have it.
On Love:
Tupac Shakur: “wow i fully hate you and your opinions”
On Intelligence:
-OmnipotentPotato-: “I think this guy may just be stupid”
J-Dot-Dot: “This dude is a moron.”
On Insecurity:
fuckwhoyouknow: “Damn how'd this reviewer get into Harvard”
[Sometimes I wonder the same.]
A_CC: “Money”
redlumxof: “Affirmative Action”
On Racial Stereotypes:
oprahsworstnightmare: “there is like a 300% chance this was written by a white dude”
subverted: “The dude is actually black (somali?). lol”
[I occasionally forget how important Kendrick Lamar is to the black community. And, without attempting to rewrite a review but simply to explain myself in a less contentious environment, I have always loved Lamar as an artist. I thought at the time that it was not too much to ask that those beacons of artistic genius in the black community live up to the full realization of their potential each time they rap, sculpt, dance, or write. Perhaps I did not live up to my potential with those critical words. Is it too much to notice the same in another?]
On Premeditation:
poopmailman: “Shut the fuck up hoe, I'll shoot your fucking brains out on your bedroom wall and lick them all up and blend em up with my protein shake BITCH”
[That sounds unsanitary.]
Ooomar: “I'll chipa n**** then throw the blower in his lap”
Jason Mejia: “these hands are free to be caught my guy”
[I’d rather you didn’t do that.]
On Family:
Michael Darer: “damn my guy when i embarrass everyone who's ever known and loved me i try to do it on a less public scale. think of how your parents must feel knowing their child has the worst opinions in history. that's gotta be rough”
The_Mister_Rager: “Delete this nephew”
[Uncle John? Is that you?]
On Critical Liberty and Harvard:
Sharky1289: “This is why we don't let snotty Harvard students critique anything. This dude listened to Hip Hop for a week”
[That is factually false, but I’ll allow it.]
On Gender and Sexuality:
NAS: “Bitch you're a hoe”
Richard Cipian: “Punk ass bitch”
Arno Demeulemeester: “eat a dick bros”
On Happiness:
thirtiethst: “hey aziz, when you read this thread, don't take it personally - we just think you missed the mark. […] don't stop being creative :)”
[Of course I did not take this personally. Of course I did not hide in my room, resentment turned to half-blown depression in the days that followed. Of course I did not realize that I cannot take the criticism that I occasionally give. Of course not—taking it personally would require being a person in your eyes. Of course not, because to you all, I’m nothing more than the institution on my degree and the color of my skin—a name behind an article. Personally? Don’t be daft—on the internet, none of us are people.]
On Standards:
Andres: “Crimson standards are dead.”
[Standards?]

Aries: Mercury is blocking one of Mars’s moons today, which means a turbulent day for Aries. If you are born between March 21 and April 19, you are a person of action and you hate delays, which means you hate the Quad and you despise the shuttle. So you’ll be pretty unhappy when someone schedules a meeting with you in Pfoho in the middle of the day, and you absolutely can’t get out of it. To make matters worse, it will be raining and so as much as you’d love to walk, you can’t bear the thought of slugging through the downpour, and you can’t have your wet hair because you need to look presentable for this meeting. If you have a bike, it will break before this afternoon. You will run to catch the shuttle and miss it. Then, because it’s so cold you’ll go sit in Boylston until the next shuttle which doesn’t come for 15 minutes. There, you’ll run into the TF from your least favorite class, get sucked into conversation, and miss the next shuttle. Half an hour later you will arrive at the quad and stumble through your meeting. Good news—you’ll catch the shuttle right away on the way back, but somehow you end up getting off at Mather, which you have managed to successfully avoid thus far in your college career. Don’t forget, we can’t change our fate, so sit back and enjoy the ride.
Taurus: Traditionally a Taurus is compatible with Cancer, Virgo, Capricorn and Pisces, but to be quite honest you’re not really compatible with anyone. You’re bullheaded and stubborn, which makes you rather unlikeable and unapproachable. Today is the day you’ll realize that the reason your sections never seem to have a “section kid” is because it’s actually you. You will also receive a grade on an essay in the next week that you will disagree with, but heed this warning: Don’t ask for a re-grade. The stars predict your B+ will be demoted to a B. Also, it’s highly possible your TF knows that you haven’t done the reading. Don’t fret though, you’ll probably pass your class thanks to Harvard grade inflation!
Gemini: If your birthday is between May 22 and June 21, a storm is on the way. You might be tempted to face it head-on, and your inquisitive nature will make you want to explore. Gemini are very youthful, so you are always looking for ways to play. You might want to jump in some puddles or maybe build a paper boat and float it down the gutter on the side of the road. Today, resist those temptations—avoid rain clouds and creepy clowns. Leave that bright yellow rain jacket hanging in the closet and curl up with a nice book and some hot cocoa. What could be better than staying inside on a rainy day?
Cancer: If you’re reading this, you’re probably either a Cancer or trying actively to get with a Cancer. If you’re a Cancer, keep doing you. Your imagination and emotions are highly appreciated and sought after. If you’re trying to get with a Cancer, just beware of the fact that Cancers eat the poutine in the dining halls. Choose wisely.
Leo: Although the symbol for Leo is a lion, you are more akin to the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz than the ferocious beast that roams the African plains. You are shy and you’ll pass up your dorm’s formal to stay in and watch “Stranger Things 2” for the fourth time. Unfortunately, on the last day of classes your professor will cold call you in lecture and you will be utterly clueless. No matter how much studying you do, there is really no way to prepare for this. Just accept that you, an incredibly quiet and reserve human being, will be humiliated in front of all eight students that actually showed up to the final lecture.
Virgo: Virgo is the sign for virgins, so if you were born between August 23rd and September 22nd that means you’ll never do it. Ever. This is an undeniable fact. Look it up, not a single person born on these dates has ever had children or even gotten pregnant. If you happen to be a Virgo then you will die old and alone with no children. This prognosis won’t change, so no point checking your horoscope ever again if you’re a Virgo. Between not having sex and not reading your horoscope, think of all the time you’ll save! It should be noted that the author is a Virgo.
Libra: You’re fond of all the extravagant things in life, which is especially dangerous now that it’s the holiday season. Be careful when walking by Anthropologie’s large windows. Before you know it, you’ll be back in your dorm hanging up $100, vintage, abstract ornaments on the walls. But don’t worry, this time of year has upsides as well. You’ll have fun organizing a Secret Santa or coordinating cookie exchanges with your friends. Don’t let all this excitement raise your expectations too high for gifts from friends and family members, however. Remember that a coffee delivery is a coffee delivery, whether it’s from Lam Caf or Tatte. Formals and brain breaks will be your ultimate releases to keep your social side alive.
Scorpio: If your birthday is between October 21st and November 22nd, it’s World War I and you’re Wonder Woman.
Sagittarius: You are going to come into a lot of money! However, that’s probably because you will spend 4 years getting a degree, failing to find a job in your field, and turn to consulting. You will most likely lose contact with most of your friends due to your busy work schedule, but don’t fret! You will have so much money that you can easily fill the lonely void with whatever expensive items you wish. In a worst case scenario, you can just buy yourself friends. Also, don’t be too hard on yourself for deserting your dream for money, maybe you’ll be happy one day.
Capricorn: If you're born between December 22nd and January 19th, you're an ec major. You loved Ec-10 and Mankiw is your hero and guiding star (pun intended).  If you're not an ec major, we didn’t get it wrong: you did. Underclassman, it's not too late to give in to the inevitable and make the change. Upperclassmen shouldn’t be discouraged either. Don't forget that even if you graduate VES, you're statistically pretty likely to end up in finance or consulting anyway.
Aquarius: Even though the element for Aquarius is air, its symbol is the Water Bearer. Those are two things that we all need to survive—water and air! Judging by the amount of rain that Cambridge has seen recently, the stars are aligned in your favor. However, be wary of the cold. Soon, it’ll turn your water and raindrops into ice and snow. Don’t let the cold freeze your heart too. But if it does, don’t worry, because cuffing season is right around the corner.
Pisces: Born between February 19 to March 20, Pisces are made to thrive during midterms season. Use your creative and intuitive traits to somehow get you through a ten-hour pset that’s due in the next two hours, or to write a paper on that book you “forgot” to read. Despite not necessarily being “the section kid” in your humanities gen-ed, your insightful comments have not gone unnoticed. Remember that participation points depend not only on frequency, but also the quality of content, which you’re knocking out of the park. Your naturally compassionate disposition means that you’ll also help many friends get through this highly stressful time. But don’t forget to leave yourself some time for TLC as well. Pisces are also known to be artistic—so comp Crimson Arts next semester!

Top Fives have always been here. Our earliest ancestors scrawled them between cave paintings, foundational works such as “Top Five Things That Have Eaten Gronk’s Children” and “Top Five Debilitating Illnesses That Will Probably Kill Me Because Science Doesn’t Exist Yet.” God tossed a hat in the ring with his seminal “Top Five Commandments,” a listicle so popular on the ancient version of the Internet (Moses) that a sequel instantly ensued. The form of Top Fives has seeped deep into our very being, influencing our routines, giving structure to our thoughts. Just today, you have most likely formulated lists of your own: “Top Five Groceries,” perhaps, or “Top Five Places I May Have Left My Newborn Infant.” Top Fives preceded us, and Top Fives will certainly remain long after we are gone.
Yet not all Top Fives deserve to be celebrated. Some are a discredit to the craft, worth reading only as cautionary tales. To both atone for our sins and learn from them, here are the most shameful Top Fives The Crimson has published.
5. Top Five Stepfathers by Moby F. Neutrogena ’13A maudlin, irrelevant Top Five. Especially suspect, as all five stepfathers appear to be Neutrogena. Notable for its surprisingly rigorous scoring system, which evaluates each father’s proficiency in “playing catch” and “kissing Mommy,” and a cameo from Tim Allen (listed as number 5).
4. Top Five Uses of Time Travel by Dilda E. Bobbin ’73Either a hoax or a glitch in time, both unacceptable. A list of historical “mistakes” “corrected” with time “travel,” published in “the” year “2473.” Suggests unnervingly that the world as we know it has been reshaped according to the gauche tastes of our disappointing descendants. The denizens of 2473 claim responsibility for the career of Alanis Morissette (listed as number 2) and also racism (listed as number 4). Smarmily written.
3. Top Five Slurs by Tom. A. Toetamahtoe ’43A mid-twentieth century listicle that has aged somewhat poorly. One of the most widely read Blog pieces of all time, despite being published in 1941, when everybody had like DSL or something. Each slur is accompanied by instructions for use and enthusiastic customer testimonials, three of which are credited to Colonel Sanders.
2. Top Five Top Fives by Kot N. Flagrante-Delicto ’10A disgrace to the art of Top Five, even as it purports to pay reverence. Leaves out such classics as “Top Five Syndromes” by Jonathan P. Trang ’19, or “Top Five Font Sizes” by Jonathan P. Trang ’19, or “Top Five Moles on John Oliver’s Body That He Should Probably Have Examined” by Jonathan P. Trang ’19. Granted, these were published long after Flagrante-Delicto ’10’s tenure at the Crimson. Yet she should have had the foresight to refrain from such a premature victory lap, especially one that includes Fyodor X. Groudon ’03’s “Top Five Fingers (Left Hand)” instead of its superior sequel, Borgesiana G. Jiggleflap ’05’s “Top Five Fingers (Right Hand).”
1. Top Five Serial Killers by Laird T. Milk ’19A more than passable piece, admittedly. The detailed, almost loving descriptions of the methods of each murderer are poetic and useful. But Laird is a rank coward and a fool who should learn to let his pistol speak for him rather than his lawyer. I apologize for this intrusion of the personal, but I have no other platform through which I can publicly demand satisfaction. Meet me at the dueling grounds, Laird! The one next to Noch’s!
—Incoming Blog Series Exec Jonathan P. Trang ’19 is deeply unpleasant. You can reach him over that new Animal Crossing app, which is now his primary mode of communication.

As someone always looking for up-and-coming talent, I’ve been obsessed with Lil Pump for months. I’ve come to realize that the Trapper of the Century’s biggest hit, “Gucci Gang,” is in everything I hear. It’s the Pachelbel’s Canon of the modern age. “Gucci Gang” is so defining a statement of rap’s most timeless figure that it is present in all music. Lil Pump is the beginning and the end of time, both the root of art and its final state. “Gucci Gang” has existed in many forms since the first crickets realized they could make music, but has blessed us in this year of 2017 with its presence in full form. Pump’s mastery of craft is so thorough that “Gucci Gang” has definitively shaped music as we know it. Don’t believe it? Here are five examples that demonstrate the breadth of “Gucci Gang”’s impact.
“Keep Ya Head Up”: In 1992, 2Pac was jealous of Lil Pump’s success as a deep, lyrical rapper and stole the lyrics to a new song Pump was working on to make “Keep Ya Head Up.” In response, Pump took the remaining beat and turned it into “Gucci Gang.” I think we all know who did better with that one.
“Mr. Brightside”: Lil Pump and Brandon Flowers used to go to the same church in Las Vegas. In 2001, Pump gave Flowers “Mr. Brightside” because he believed Flowers’ new band, The Killers, wouldn’t survive without the extra help. To thank him, Flowers gave Pump the immortal line “My bitch love do cocaine (ooh).”
“All Too Well”: Lil Pump and Liz Rose are actually old friends, and Pump used his connections to introduce Rose to a young singer-songwriter named Taylor Swift. The two hit it off and Rose co-wrote some of Swift’s biggest hits. Not coincidentally, “Gucci Gang” pays homage to Swift’s greatest song on her album “Red” with the line, “Bought some red bottoms, cost hella Gs (huh).”
“Rumours”: Circa 1976, Pump was Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham’s dealer, and he eventually became popular with the rest of Fleetwood Mac. Pump’s supply ensured the band got along while recording their magnum opus. Several members of the band have confirmed that “Rumours” is dedicated in part to Lil Pump. In fact, the immortal title to Pump’s masterpiece is etched in the liner notes of the album.
“Purple Rain”: Pump says “Gucci Gang” 57 times on the track—a reference to Prince, who died last year at 57. The song was a message to Prince that he’ll still look sharp in heaven. The line, “I can’t buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh)” confirms this, referencing Prince’s struggles with commitment and love in the movie soundtracked by Prince’s opus. Lil Pump’s eponymous album is in fact purple-themed in honor of the movie’s title track.
These five examples illustrate something very important: “Gucci Gang” is present in all music. Truly no artist has ever been as omniscient as Pump. His biggest hit has influenced over six decades of music. From the fluttering yet abrasive instrumentation of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” to the distorted wail of the solo in Kanye’s “Runaway” to, well, Lil Pump himself, “Gucci Gang” has inspired countless revolutionary works of music. It is truly the summit of our culture, in everything and everyone. All songs lead to “Gucci Gang.” It is the beginning and the end. The alpha and the omega. The genesis and the finale. Gucci Gang. Gucci Gang. Gucci Gang. Gucci Gang. Gucci Gang.
—Edward M. Litwin is the incoming music exec, and yes, by the way, he does have a Lil Pump tattoo. And no, you can’t see it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


Folks, my two-year tenure as a Crimson Arts exec is coming to a close. Somewhere along the line, I stopped being the board’s Boy Wonder and started being so old that I found myself on the deliberating side of the Crimson’s Turkey Shoot. During those long nights of discussion about the future of this prestigious organization, it became clear that The Crimson needed a way to make the “fringe boards”—which I believe means those not named “Arts” or “Editorial”—feel part of an integrated whole. As the outgoing music exec, I thought I might best contribute by suggesting the songs most fit to serve as building-wide anthems. I hope at least one of these makes a news exec finally feel at home at 14 Plympton Street.
5. Fleetwood Mac, “Second Hand News”
“Second Hand News” is actually the modus operandi of most college newspapers. Not The Crimson, we bring you the raw, breaking stuff. But this gem, which kicks off Fleetwood Mac’s 1977 masterpiece “Rumours,” doesn’t just have “news” in the title. Its bittersweet blend of heartbreaking lyrics and irrepressible melody make it a perfect fit for an organization with which every single member has a love-hate relationship.

4. Fleetwood Mac, Everything Else on “Rumours”
…That being said, every other track on “Rumours” is even better. All Harvard students can relate to Stevie Nicks’s reflections on lost love, and not just because we’ve given up on all of our own “Dreams.” No matter how many times a Crimson exec might tell himself he’s “Never Going Back Again,” this publication will somehow bring him back indeed to the newsroom. He will never break “The Chain.”

3. ABBA, “Dancing Queen”
What better way to promote inter-board collaboration than “Dancing Queen”? As an ode to dance, that most athletic of art forms, it celebrates the unlikely but flourishing Arts-Sports Alliance. Plus, we play it at literally every Crimson party already, so transition costs, like the lights, are low.

2. Styx, “Come Sail Away”
Speaking of inter-board collaboration, who could forget the Editorial Board’s decision to run a piece entirely about music (which is an Art) with the thesis that more people should listen to “Come Sail Away,” especially at parties? I remain unconvinced of the song’s merits, but I do know that the Ed board is never wrong. And let’s face it—this is now the song most identified with The Crimson. That’s right: After my year as music exec, the “Come Sail Away” piece is by far the most widely read music-related article on thecrimson.com. So, “Come Sail Away” is who we are, plain and simple. Let’s own every power chord of this arena-rock monstrosity.

1. Smash Mouth, “All Star”
According to TVTropes, the producers of the monumental 2001 film “Shrek” originally intended only to use “All Star” in the title sequence as a placeholder but never found another song. It’s difficult now to imagine a world without “Shrek” and its ska kickoff. Likewise, many Crimson editors (all evidence anecdotal and autobiographical) comped freshman year out of curiosity, but as their other extracurriculars fell away (or cut them), The Crimson became, accidentally, their Thing. Then, the years started coming, and they didn’t stop coming. For better or worse—and why not say better?—our time at Harvard would never be the same. Also, most of Crimson Arts’ institutional memory is encyclopedic Shrek trivia. If I have any kind of legacy in these hallowed halls, every board will have a Shrek exec. A Shrexec or Shrexpert, if you will. And they will all sing “All Star” in harmony.
—Trevor J. Levin is the outgoing music exec, comp director, Shrexpert, and according to testimonials (available upon request), “soul of the Arts Board.” He is studying abroad for at least the next semester, depending on when The Crimson’s water fountain gets fixed, but until his return, he can be reached at trevor.levin@thecrimson.com.

It’s come to my attention that some people consider the Arts Board to be a “fringe board” with regard to the rest of the Crimson. I don’t know why this is. Maybe it’s because about twelve people read Arts (Hi Mom!). Maybe it’s because FM keeps stealing the Arts sign off the door of our shared office. Maybe it’s because the last time the Arts Board attended a Crimson-wide social event was Spring 2014, when one of the compers got lost during Grand Elections and wandered around the basement for half an hour.
Whatever the reason, apparently some people don’t see Arts as particularly “essential to the core mission of The Crimson,” or “essential to any mission of The Crimson,” or “compliant with basic journalistic standards.” So I’ve decided to compile a brief guide to Arts, so that everyone understands what a valuable and relatable board we are. Unfortunately, I appear to have put this guide in Arts’ Year-in-Review, a collection of inside joke-packed vanity pieces and bizarre rankings of popular art, so “everyone” is likely to be about six people (Hi Mom!).
Arts began its existence writing informative pieces about artistic offerings around Harvard’s campus. Today, this service has largely been shelved, because (a) nobody wanted to write them and (b) nobody wanted to read them. It lives on largely in the form of the Arts Calendar, a weekly guide to Cambridge-area art written by indentured laborers under the supervision of incoming Arts Chair Grace Z. Li, a cruel and unforgiving taskmaster.
Arts nimbly transitioned to other media, previewing and reviewing artistic offerings (films, books, music) on the national stage with all the sophistication and nuance that college freshmen are known for. These pieces were published in Arts’ magazine, a beautifully designed weekly collection of art and art criticism that I imagine brought a great deal of joy to its three readers. Admittedly, Arts’ policy of refusing to publish any article online if it didn’t happen to refer to a piece as “flawed but compelling” was not exactly “digital-friendly.” Still, this was a golden age for Arts. Unfortunately, the rest of The Crimson eventually noticed that we’d been using their printer for this project, and so the magazine got cut. But hey, now print media’s dying (along with journalism generally), so really the joke’s on them, right?
Arts today is largely focused on providing cutting-edge commentary on Taylor Swift’s music videos. Still, if you would like some coverage of your artwork or event, please feel free to reach out to us! You might be able to reach Arts at our email address (arts@thecrimson.com), at the Crimson’s building (ask to be shown to FM’s office), or by talking to incoming Arts Chairs Mila Gauvin and Grace Li. Just please, for the love of God, don’t contact me. I’ve done my time.
Once Arts agrees to write a piece for you, you may not hear back from us for a while. Our policy is not to publish a piece until it’s been edited twice, fact-checked, proofed in triplicate, lost in the archives for several months, proofed again, and then poorly rewritten at the last minute. Rest assured, however, that somewhere in the shadows of The Crimson, Arts is working as hard as ever to produce quality content for its readers (Hi Mom!).
—Outgoing Arts Chair J. Thomas Westbrook is a ghost. He cannot be contacted by any means known to man, especially not email or Twitter. Some say that those willing to brave the trek to Pforzheimer House can find him there, but who would do that?

The United States Department of Justice has recently threatened to sue Harvard if it does not turn over a document relevant to its current investigation of the University’s consideration of race in its admissions process. Given the ostensibly political nature of the investigation, it appears that the Department plans to very aggressively challenge Harvard’s affirmative action policies—and, consequently, affirmative action policies at universities nationwide. While we hope that Harvard complies with its legal obligations in this investigation, we also expect the University to make a compelling case for how affirmative action positively serves this institution.
There is good reason to believe that the Justice Department’s investigation is politically motivated. It is probable that the front office of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department—which is run by political appointees instead of career civil-service lawyers in the Education Opportunities Section—is overseeing the investigation. Furthermore, an attorney representing Harvard has noted that it is “exceptionally unusual” for the Department of Justice to be investigating a complaint that was filed over two years ago.
Moreover, it is possible that the Justice Department’s aggressive probing of Harvard’s admissions practices will indirectly assist the civil lawsuit against Harvard brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014. The Justice Department’s escalating and forceful scrutiny of Harvard has all the trappings of a partisan attack on affirmative action policies, and its implications will likely reverberate beyond Harvard to affect schools practicing affirmative action nationwide.
Harvard has cited student privacy concerns in its choice to delay handing over documents to the government. Although it is impossible to tell whether this is a delaying tactic or a legitimate concern—or both—we of course hope that the University fulfills its legal obligations and cooperates with the investigation to the extent that is required by law.
However, the fulfillment of legal obligations and mounting a compelling defense of affirmative action are not mutually exclusive. As we have argued before, affirmative action is important for the University to remain diverse and accessible. Affirmative action at Harvard, and at universities throughout the country, is not perfect, but it serves a critical role in helping students learn from their peers as well as remedying societal inequality. Eliminating it altogether would be devastating.
If the Justice Department ultimately chooses to sue Harvard, or even simply submit a amicus brief arguing against affirmative action, the University must give a strong defense of affirmative action—not only to preserve its own admissions policies, but also similar policies at other schools throughout the country.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

“OK, but if you had to choose one?”
Last year, one of my classmates asked me this after I had repeatedly stated that I find people of many different genders attractive. I was a bit taken aback by the question, which was dismissive of everything I’d just explained and also relied on the assumption that sexuality is a choice. How am I supposed to choose?
We live in a culture that’s obsessed with binaries and categorizing people into neat little boxes. We’re fed the false narrative that you’re either gay or straight, a man or a woman, this or that. And this forced categorization is more insidious than just a desire for order. There’s a pervasive desperation to pin people down and make them more palatable to other people so that those in the majority can stay comfortable. When you can box someone up, it’s easier to set them aside and ignore them. It’s much harder to ignore the person who’s spilling outside the lines and existing beyond rigid boxes.
As we’ve come to better understand gender, gender expression, and romantic and sexual orientation, it’s become clearer that these identities exist on a spectrum, not two distinct categories. Continuing to perpetuate binaries leads to erasure of identities that exist on the spectrum.
Assuming that everyone is either a man or a woman completely erases the existence of anyone who doesn’t fit either one, such as non-binary or gender nonconforming people. This erasure occurs every time someone says “he or she” or “ladies and gentlemen” instead of the gender-neutral “they” or “people.” Bathrooms, clothing, children’s toys, and gender options on forms are all among the infinite list of things usually divided into two genders, which forces non-binary and gender nonconforming people to choose one or the other.
Bi and pan identities are also often erased. It’s common to refer to a relationship between people of the same gender as “gay,” even when there’s an infinite number of sexualities that the partners could be. On the other hand, many will see a relationship between two people of different genders and assume that it’s a “straight” relationship. We tend to look at people in a particular situation and use that to make guesses about their identities, but that’s ignorant at best and dangerous at worst.
Ace erasure occurs when we assume that everyone is attracted to either the same gender or a different one, which removes the possibility of lack of attraction. The idea of sexuality being a spectrum between gay and straight is slightly more accurate than the two-category approach, but it still doesn’t take asexuality into account.
The gender binary encourages a complementary relationship structure, traditionally of one man and one woman in a monogamous marriage. The idea is that exactly two people, one from each binary gender category, partner up to make a relationship. But that erases polyamorous people who may have multiple partners.
Binaries assume that everyone is in one category or the other, and that will never change. There’s no space in that worldview for identities that are fluid and change over time, which can lead to erasure of genderfluid people and people with fluid sexualities. There’s also the erasure of people who don’t identify with any of those groups, who may refer to themselves as queer, a different label, or no label at all. We need to constantly reaffirm that all these identities are valid, powerful, and important. We won’t be silenced into quiet acceptance of the status quo.
Shattering binary structures isn’t just beneficial for people who live outside of them—although that should be reason enough, as an issue shouldn’t have to benefit the majority in order for it to be deemed worthwhile. But if we’re looking to benefit greater society, breaking down faulty binaries still makes sense. Binary thinking reinforces stereotypes about gender and sexuality, and doesn’t accurately portray those that it claims to represent. The same binary that insists that everyone is either a man or a woman also says that girls should like pink and boys should like blue, that women should be homemakers and men should be breadwinners. Breaking this binary down gives everyone a little more freedom to explore their identity, express themselves as they wish, and be more honest and open about who they are and what they want in life. There is no stereotypical man or woman, so why should we pretend like there is?
I want to clarify that it’s completely fine for people to identify strongly with a binary identity, but the key is that can’t be the only option presented. There’s nothing inherently wrong with being a woman, or with being gay, but we can’t stop there. There are an infinite number of possible identities, and we ought to recognize and affirm everyone of any identity.
In order to dismantle the binaries all around us, we’ll need to be more mindful of our language and how the words we use can create a prescriptive reality. Don’t make assumptions about the gender or sexuality of other people, even if you think you have enough evidence to make a guess. Wait for them to tell you, and if they don’t clarify, be neutral in your language. Listen to people when they tell you about their identity, and don’t dismiss their experiences if they don’t fit a binary mold. Finally, don’t pressure anyone to “choose” a binary identity.

I am a firm believer in the idea that visual landscapes disclose the culture of a community.
Harvard Yard is a space of hustling and bustling. Walk through its green spaces on a Friday afternoon and you’ll see a community coming together around spike ball, picnic blankets, and lively conversations. Cross the gates on the far end of the Yard and you will be met by Memorial Hall and the Science Center side by side, juxtaposing our University’s roots in tradition with its commitment to modern scientific discovery. These are snapshots of Harvard reflected in our physical spaces.
Now let’s do a quick scavenger hunt: find all of the physical spaces on campus that are dedicated to fostering inclusion and belonging for students from historically marginalized communities. The Women’s Center, the Harvard Foundation, the Office for BGLTQ Student Life, Harvard Hillel, the Canaday Musallah. You’ll quickly come to realize that all but one of these spaces are located underground, hidden from plain sight. Meanwhile, walk down Mount Auburn St. on a Saturday night and the presence of final clubs is inescapable. Their buildings, two or three stories tall, tower over you in comparison.
If the physical landscape of Harvard reflects our community’s commitments, then this picture is a troubling one. While students of color, queer students, women, and other historically marginalized communities are symbolically relegated to basements, the image of old Harvard—one defined by exclusivity, masculinity, wealth, and whiteness—dominates. Even as our Harvard makes broad leaps away from its ugly past by admitting one of its most diverse classes, showcasing its diversity on the main stage of Sanders Theatre, and embracing female leadership, our physical spaces remain stagnant. Crop out the students, workers, faculty, and staff and our Harvard still looks like old Harvard.
Physical space is vital, not just because it reflects our commitments, but also because the environment we inhabit and regularly interact with necessarily impacts our experiences in and feelings towards that space. In conversations and surveys, students from historically marginalized communities consistently report lacking a sense of belonging at Harvard. On paper, this seems innocuous. But as someone who struggles deeply with belonging in this community, I cannot overstate how all-encompassing this feeling has been for me. In sections, in Undergraduate Council meetings, at office hours, and in the dining hall, I have to work two or three or four times as hard to make my presence felt in spaces that weren’t built for me.
Because my time at Harvard has so far been defined by my efforts to carve out a space for myself and people like me on this campus, I’ve had little time left to explore my interests, pursue my passions, be a student, or even just sleep. These feelings are not mine alone: I hear these sentiments daily from my friends, people I work with, and acquaintances in passing.
So what is the solution? How can we foster more belonging on campus for students whose identities have been historically and systematically excluded? I can’t pretend to know the antidote to such a deep-seeded problem. However, I echo the sentiments of Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei when she writes: “if Harvard is going to include people from diverse backgrounds, and they’re each to feel they belong, the physical infrastructure has to reflect their presence on campus.” A physical space for diversity, belonging, and inclusion on this campus is a crucial step forward.
This is not a novel idea. Harvard has seen advocacy for a Multicultural Center for over 40 years now. Peer institutions and colleges throughout the nation have recognized how essential such a physical space is for fulfilling their mission of creating a welcoming campus community for all. And when presented with a referendum asking if Harvard College should create a sufficient physical space dedicated to fostering diversity, belonging, and inclusion on campus, more than half of the voters in the most recent UC election answered with a resounding “Yes”.
Moving forward,  the Undergraduate Council will be tasked with creating a policy statement in response to the results of this referendum. I, along with several other members of the UC and the broader Harvard community, will be drafting this statement. Our top priority has been and will be fielding input and feedback from the community at large. And when the time comes for administrators to make a decision on whether or not this is a project they will get behind, I hope all of us can meet at the table with open minds and a willingness to think creatively to envision the ideal solution.
Even if a physical space is built and our community’s commitments reaffirmed, the work to create a more inclusive community for all will hardly be done. Institutional change takes time. None of us who are currently enrolled at the College will likely see this space before we graduate. But when I envision Harvard 40 years from now, I see a visual landscape that reflects the diversity of its community. I see students from historically marginalized communities thriving in that landscape. And I see the proposed space as a central part of that community. Let’s build it together.

Harvard Management Company is moving to outsource the management of its real estate assets to Bain Capital—the largest Boston-based private equity firm—according to a Bloomberg News report published last week.
HMC, which manages Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment, has been considering spinning off its real estate team since January. At the beginning of 2017, N.P. Narvekar, the firm’s CEO, wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates that the “the team responsible for managing HMC’s direct real estate investments is expected to spin out and become an external manager by the end of calendar year 2017.”
Harvard’s endowment grew 8.1 percent in fiscal year 2017, the lowest among Ivy League endowments. Since Narvekar’s appointment as CEO in late 2016, HMC has moved to eliminate internally-managed investments, seeking to lay off nearly half of its staff by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.
According to the Bloomberg report, Bain would hire roughly 20 people from HMC and become the money manager for Harvard’s real estate investments.
Harvard’s real estate portfolio has traditionally been one of its strongest asset classes. In the 2016 fiscal year, real estate assets comprised 14.5 percent of Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment and garnered 13.8 percent returns, higher than the University’s 2016 yields in other assets classes such as private equity, domestic bonds, or foreign equity.
In the University’s financial report for fiscal year 2017, Narvekar cited strong real estate returns as one of the reasons for the growth in the  endowment size. But Narvekar also wrote in the report that the University has executed sales in real estate, generating “significant liquidity for the endowment.” He reiterated HMC’s expectation to spin off the real estate platform.
“We are working closely with the team to support this effort and to execute a mutually beneficial arrangement as an external manager,” he wrote in the report.
Bain Capital and Harvard Management Company both declined to comment for this the story.

Long-hidden posters and woodblock prints from the years of China’s Cultural Revolution now adorn the walls of Harvard’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
The pieces, part of an exhibit called “Red and Black Revolution: Dazibao and Woodcuts from 1960s China,” were unveiled at the Fairbank Center in early November, marking the first time members of the public can see these prints.
During the Chinese Cultural Revolution, government officials sought to purge the country from all traces of capitalist thought. The posters—also called dazibao—were a crucial medium to criticize and discredit individuals who were thought to oppose the revolution.
An anonymous collector donated the dazibao to the Fairbank Center, according to Susan Israel ’81, who first thought of bringing the prints to Harvard. Center staff have also organized a four-part blog series to accompany the exhibit.
The exhibit opened at the beginning of November with a panel discussion on the history of dazibao featuring Harvard professors and other scholars.
Fairbank Center Director Michael Szonyi moderated the event, and said the dazibao, which he called “powerful visual symbols of the cultural revolution,” will be the main focus of the exhibition.
“Whether one sees these big-character posters and woodblock prints primarily in aesthetic terms, or treats them as historic relics or as objects that provoke conversations about China’s complex relationship with the past, we think they are worthy subjects of research and analysis,” he said.
Jie Li, an assistant professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, called dazibao a pre-digital viral media.
“Because big character posters have big characters that can be legible from a distance even though of course some of them are for pure display, they competed for public attention,” Li said.
“They are also remembered as ‘blotting out the sky and covering the Earth,’” she added, referencing the posters’ omnipresence in 1960s China.
Li said apart from repeating slogans and copying from newspapers, many people created dazibao to feature extremely private content and launch personal attacks on others. History professor Roderick MacFarquhar compared the accusatory nature of dazibao with President Donald Trump’s critical tweets.
Given the sensitivity of some of the messages written on the dazibao, the exhibit’s curators decided to conceal the names of individuals mentioned on the posters,
“Many of these individuals are either still living, or have living relatives who may view these works, and so we have obscured their names for ethical reasons,” said James Evans, the center’s communications director.
The exhibit, which has been on display since November 9, will run until Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recipients of the 2018 Institute of Politics Director’s Internship Program will receive a $5,000 stipend for their summer internships, a $1,000 boost from past years.
The IOP had been considering the increase for the past few years, according to Spencer E. Shapiro ’18, the current Internships and Careers Services chair at the IOP. Last year, the IOP piloted the $5,000 stipend for participants with financial needs and received a warm reception from the Director’s Interns, according to Shapiro.
After the positive feedback, the IOP decided to officially increase the Director’s Internship Program stipend. Shapiro said the increase will make it financially easier for students to complete internships in the public sector.
“The students who received this augmented funding reported it decreased the financial strain on them spending the summer working in the public sector,” Shapiro said.
Part of the “financial strain” of these internships stems from spending eight to ten weeks in expensive cities that can take a toll on the average college student’s budget. Without funding from groups like the IOP, many students face public sector internships that do not provide financial compensation.
Shira Li ’19, a 2016 Director’s Intern, noted that expenses are especially problematic in bigger cities.
Li, who completed an internship with 270 Strategies in Chicago last year, said the amount was was enough to cover her expenses, but added that it may have been insufficient for students living in more expensive cities.
Laura L. Doherty ‘19, a 2017 director’s intern who worked with NASA in Washington, D.C., said high costs can can be a deciding factor for students who are considering participating in summer internships like the Director’s Internship Program.
“I think students often find themselves weighing the tension of finances while deciding which summer activities to engage in,” she said.
Doherty, who received $5,000 in total due to an additional $1,000 in her role as a Schaeffer Fellow, stated that the stipend was sufficient for her because she was able to split the cost of living with two other roommates and could inexpensively travel to and from her home in New York when necessary.
However, she noted that if her circumstances had been different, the internship might not have been as financially accessible.
“Had I perhaps lived farther away from D.C., or if I was unable to find an apartment within budget, I may not be making the same claims,” she said.
Through the $1,000 funding increase, the IOP hopes to alleviate the burden of expenses and, in doing so,  “remove one of the barriers to pursuing a summer in public service,” Shapiro said.
The IOP Director’s Internship Program is a competitive application process. The program receives hundreds of applications every year for dozens of jobs in public service internship positions. Some students go on to receive employment offers after their summer jobs.

Harvard Kennedy School is partnering with MIT to launch a joint program aiming to “mentor the next generation of foreign policy scholars,” according to a statement from the Kennedy School earlier this month.
The fellowship—a collaboration between the MIT Security Studies Program at the Center for International Studies in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the Kennedy School—is sponsored by $1.8 million in grants from the Charles Koch Foundation to each respective school.
The program, dubbed the Project on Grand Strategy, Security, and Statecraft, will provide “pre- or postdoctoral fellowships to young scholars from a variety of disciplines working in the broad area of strategy and statecraft, with particular emphasis on the US and its role in the world,” according to the Kennedy School statement.
Stephen M. Walt, a professor of international affairs at the Kennedy School, and Barry R. Posen, a political science professor at MIT, will co-direct the program.  Students in the fellowship will spend one year at Harvard and one year at MIT, according to the statement.
“The fellows program will build a community of scholars dedicated to fundamental research on the most critical security problems of our time, and to bringing the fruits of that research to public policy,"  Posen said.
The fellowship also intends to foster discussion about security issues and appropriate responses with the goal of better informing those taking action, the statement said.
“States are more likely to make sound strategic choices and learn from past mistakes if there is a well-informed and wide-ranging debate on these issues,” Walt said.
“A healthy democracy therefore requires a diverse and well-trained community of independent experts who understand strategy, security, and statecraft and whose work can inform elites and public debates on foreign policy, and especially decisions to use force,” he added.
Beyond the joint fellowship program, the foundation’s funding will be used to “support the research of graduate students in security studies at both institutions,” the statement reads.
“We are excited to support Harvard and MIT’s world-class vision for engaging the next generation of foreign policy scholars as they develop the research and ideas that will inform this discussion,” said William P. Ruger, Vice President of the Charles Koch Foundation.

Students in Pforzheimer House have organized a large fundraising effort to raise money and collect supplies for a still-devastated and resource-deprived Puerto Rico after the havoc caused by Hurricane Maria.
The organizers of the event created a YouCaring page to raise money throughout the semester, setting a goal of $500. In addition to monetary donation efforts, the organizers placed bins in Pforzheimer House, encouraging students to donate items such as bottled water, first-aid kits, and hand sanitizer.
Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm, hit Puerto Rico in late September, devastating the United States territory.
One of the organizers of the event, Nathan W. Siegelaub ’18, a member of the Pforzheimer House Committee, said he was inspired to raise money after hearing about the situation in Puerto Rico from his elementary school teacher.
“I think that it is never too hard to give back a little because a little given downwards will go a long way for people who really need it,” Siegelaub said. “I don’t think most people quite grasp how dire it is in Puerto Rico right now and how much of it can go a long way.”
Organizers are also planning a pastelillo bake sale in the Quad next week to raise money. A pastelillo is a Puerto Rican dessert similar to a turnover.
Jesper W. Ke ’19, an inactive Crimson News editor and the public service representative for Pforzheimer House, said this fundraiser was a chance for the House to come together to support Puerto Rico.
“We decided that, more than just this fundraiser through [the Phillips Brooks House Association], we wanted to extend it to do something bigger, set a bigger goal for raising funds that we can send to nonprofits that are doing good work on hurricane relief,” Ke said.
Organizers stressed that this initiative was not just for Pforzheimer residents but rather an opportunity for all Harvard students to give to Puerto Ricans in need.
Francisco Matos ’20, an organizer of the effort, emphasized the importance of this fundraiser for many families and students—even on Harvard’s campus.
“I encourage everyone on campus to take these fundraisers seriously and respect them, because I currently have multiple family members with no roofs on their houses, and helping out this fundraiser, no matter how small a step, is the least I could do,” Matos wrote in an email.

Television host Chris Matthews and human rights activist Kerry Kennedy discussed the legacy of  Robert F. Kennedy ’48, contrasting the politician’s style to President Donald Trump at the Institute of Politics Monday evening.
Matthews and Kerry Kennedy, Robert Kennedy’s third daughter, applauded Robert Kennedy’s values and authenticity, noting that his leadership would prove helpful in today’s political climate.
Both Matthews and Kerry Kennedy praised Robert Kennedy’s skill of connecting with others. Robert Kennedy, who was running for President at the time of his death in 1968, ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, and he collaborated with workers and activists throughout his campaign.
“That spirit of unity, of empathy, of having a moral compass is what all the leaders miss today. We don’t have those elements in our leadership core,” Matthews said.
Journalist Michael Barnicle, who moderated the discussion, said Robert Kennedy’s campaign looked to find the United States’s “national soul.”
Matthews also discussed his most recent book, called “Bobby Kennedy: A Raging Spirit,” which discusses Robert Kennedy’s legacy with regard to politics of the twenty-first century.
“I’m running Bobby Kennedy against Trump right now. That’s what I’m doing. That’s why I’m here, that’s what the book’s about,” he said.
Kerry Kennedy, who also heads a human rights organization in her father’s name, commended Matthews’s book.
“I told [Matthews] that I hate books about my father. I hate reading them. Because then I’m always yelling at the author and saying that this has nothing to do with reality,” she said. “But I loved this book.”
Kerry Kennedy said she agreed that her father’s leadership style emphasizing empathy and equality should be replicated by politicians of today.
“His life mantra was ‘get your boots off his neck’, and if you look at his life through that prism, that’s really what he spent a great deal of time doing,” she said.
Gene A. Corbin, the College’s assistant dean for public service, said he thought Robert Kennedy’s values made him a leader people could be hopeful about during the tumultuous landscape of the 1960s.
“That he was human and willing to present himself to others in a human way, trying to figure out truth and justice and changing along the way—in a way that made him more a leader,” Corbin said.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 also attended the event and said he thought Robert Kennedy’s work provided a contrast with modern-day politics.
“I picked up on that immensely, the notion that politicians today figure out what you want to hear and give it to you. They don’t, as Bobby did, stand for something and go out with that moral compass and say a vote from me will...ensure that I will fight for these things,” he said.

Mayors from Kansas City, Baton Rouge, and South Bend, I.N. spoke about ways that cities can function as incubators for innovation in a panel discussion attended by students, sitting politicians, and over 20 newly-elected mayors at the Institute of Politics Tuesday evening.
The event, co-sponsored by Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative and the Ash Center for Democratic Governance & Innovation, offered new mayors the opportunity to learn from three seasoned peers: Kansas City, Mo. Mayor Sylvester “Sly” James Jr., Baton Rouge, La. Mayor Sharon Weston Broome, and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04.
The panel discussion was part of a conference to bring together newly elected mayors across the country.
Moderator Jorrit de Jong, the faculty director of the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, opened the discussion with his thoughts on the importance of cities and innovation.
“I think cities are concentrations of human potential, and cities are where many of our problems are but also where many new solutions are created,” de Jong said. “Most mayors are not innovators by choice. They are innovators by necessity. And they have to.”
De Jong then moved the conversation over to the panelists, asking James what he believed was his most important innovation as a mayor.
James spoke about “K.C. Staff,” a system aimed at keeping public officials accountable through a citizen-satisfaction survey. He stressed the importance of listening to citizens’ opinions and responding to their needs.
“I love my job, being a mayor is the best job in politics,” James said. “We don’t spend a lot of time yacking and fighting and arguing. We spend all of our time getting things done.”
De Jong then asked the same question to Broome, who explained that she was proudest of the improvements to public education in her city she made by forging new partnerships. “One of the first things that I did was to bring our school board together with our city council. That had never been done before,” Broome said. “And believe it or not, that went over really well.”
Buttigieg stressed the importance of goal-setting, even if certain goals might be hard to achieve.
“That creates the kind of pressure. You are putting a pressure on yourself,” Buttigieg said. “It also kind of adds pressure from your community to get this done.”
After the event, Hillary L. Schieve, the mayor of Reno, Nev. since 2014, said, “I feel honored to be here among fellow mayors.”
“It really does make you relate to other mayors and the challenges they have,” she added.

In a game that saw nine lead changes and five ties through the first 20 minutes of play, the ending was perhaps less exciting for the Harvard men’s basketball team in its final game at the Wooden Legacy Tournament.
After holding a Cal State Fullerton squad within two possessions for nearly the entirety of the second half, it was five consecutive trips to the free throw line for the Titans that would ultimately spell a 70-61 loss for the Crimson on Sunday.
All told, nine of Cal State Fullerton’s last 11 points came at the charity stripe.
While Harvard (3-4) barely held a lead in the second half, Sunday’s matchup was far from a runaway win for the Titans (3-3)—with just over four minutes left on the clock, two free throws from sophomore guard Bryce Aiken put Harvard within a possession at 57-54.
From there, however, Cal State Fullerton junior guard Khalil Ahmad took matters into his own hands. After Aiken’s layup, the guard drove in for a layup to give the Titans a five point lead.
A minute and a pair of split free throws later, the junior drove through contact and laid it in with the foul to give Cal State Fullerton a nine-point lead with 2:38 to go. From there, the Titans would score their next seven at the line to hand Harvard its second loss of the tournament.
“We could never get consecutive stops,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Each time we inched closer, we couldn’t get another stop. They put us into a position to foul, which we did, and they did a tremendous job from the foul line shooting 23 out of 30. That’s a very solid percentage for a team on any given night. I felt that was the biggest difference in the game.”
For a period of nearly three minutes down the stretch, the Crimson couldn’t seem to find the bottom of the net. With Cal State Fullerton converting on 17 of 20 trips to the line in the second half, Harvard struggled to stay in the game late.
“They’re a tough, athletic, slashing team that Coach Taylor has done a fantastic job of putting together,” Amaker said. “I thought our inability to play without fouling was probably the biggest key of the game. We couldn’t overcome that.”
With multiple Crimson players dealing with illness, Harvard struggled to find rhythm on offense.
The Crimson’s leading scorers, Aiken and sophomore forward Seth Towns, both entered the game dealing with illness. With Towns out of the starting lineup, the Crimson struggled to make a significant push on offense after trading baskets for much of the first half.
While the Titans wouldn’t miss a field goal through the first six and half minutes of the of the second period, the Crimson stayed within two possessions for most of what became a defensive grind.
Though the defense came through to keep Cal State Fullerton within striking distance, Harvard could find no answer for sophomore Jackson Rowe.
The versatile 6’7’’ forward finished the contest with 25 points, five rebounds, and two assists—all without missing a single shot.
“I was a little disappointed we didn’t play better position defense, but [Cal State Fullerton] is very athletic with a lot of guys who can drive into the paint,” Amaker said. “[Rowe] had a tremendous game with his shooting ability and how effective he was against us from the perimeter.”
Through forty minutes of play, the sophomore shot a perfect 10-of-10 from the field and an even more impressive five-of-five from beyond the arc.
“[Rowe’s] put in the work to be able to shoot the ball from the perimeter and the number bare those facts out,” Cal State Fullerton coach Dedrique Taylor said. “When you put in that type of work, put in that type of dedication, the proof is in the pudding."
For a Harvard team that lives beyond the perimeter, the long ball simply wasn’t falling on Sunday. The Crimson shot 36 percent from deep with Aiken going 0-of-4 from beyond the arc. Despite the tough shooting, Aiken finished with a team-high 16 points while junior guard Corey Johnson added 11 off the bench.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball headed to the University of Virginia to compete in the Cavalier Classic this past weekend, playing two tightly contested games in two days.
“I think this non-conference schedule has been really good in terms of helping us identify our weaknesses,” sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm said. “It will help us go into Ivy League play at our best.”
VIRGINIA 50, HARVARD 48
In a game of back and forth runs, Harvard (4-3, 0-0 Ivy) came up a basket short in Saturday’s opener, falling to hosts Virginia (3-4, 0-0 ACC) in a 50-48 final.
The Crimson entered Saturday’s tilt at John Paul Jones Arena riding a three-game win streak, and it looked poised to pull off the upset, entering the fourth quarter with a seven-point lead.
However, good shooting coupled with stingy defense helped the Cavaliers end the game on a 9-0 run, taking the lead late in the fourth quarter. Clutch last-minute free throws by senior forward Lauren Moses and sophomore guard Jocelyn Willoughby sealed the game for the hosts, who held on by a narrow margin and advanced to Sunday’s final against Duquesne.
“We definitely let the pressure of Virginia’s defense get to us at the end of the game,” Boehm said. “I think we’re all really disappointed to have lost the opportunity to beat a good ACC team.”
Sophomore guard Katie Benzan and junior guard and co-captain Madeline Raster paced the visitors with eleven points each, but Harvard’s twenty turnovers proved to be costly in a very tightly contested game.
“It’s definitely tough to win a close ballgame when you turn the ball over 20 times,” Benzan explained. “Those key possessions in those close games, we just can’t turn the ball over, because one possession can change the entire game.”
Virginia outscored the Crimson by a 22-5 margin in points off turnovers, 17-5 on second chance points, as well as recording 10 more rebounds. Winning the turnover and rebound battle was essential to winning a game in which the Cavaliers shot at a mere 25% clip from the field, compared to Harvard’s 38%.
Moses led Virginia with a 13 point, 10 rebound double-double, recording six of her rebounds on the offensive glass, a weakness that the Cavaliers exploited throughout Saturday’s contest.
Saturday’s game was a disappointing missed opportunity for the Crimson to record an impressive early season road win. Harvard led by as many as nine points in the fourth quarter, and outshot Virginia from the field, the three-point line, and the free-throw stripe.
HARVARD 64, NORTH CAROLINA A&T 60
Saturday’s loss relegated the Crimson to the consolation game of the Cavalier Classic, and the team took on NC A&T Sunday afternoon, which fell to Duquesne by a 73-60 final score in Saturday’s other semifinal.
Harvard’s game against the Aggies (2-4, 0-0 MEAC) was as tightly contested as Saturday’s, but a late free throw from Raster helped the Crimson seal a 64-60 victory and a third-place finish in the tournament.
Boehm scored a game-high nineteen points on 9-15 shooting, one short of her career high, chipping in five rebounds and three assists. Boehm scored ten of her points in the first half, and Harvard never trailed after her layup tied the score at seven, five minutes into the first quarter.
“I was able to get a bunch of easy baskets when our team got out in transition,” Boehm said of her performance Sunday. “My teammates did a great job of getting me the ball in the post, I had some amazing passes from all of the guards.”
Although the Crimson led for the majority of the game, NC A&T narrowed the deficit late in the game. The Aggies committed only 13 turnovers to Harvard’s 21, and they were able to hang around in large part due to the Crimson’s struggles at the free throw stripe, only converting on 43% of the team’s chances from the line.
Benzan played another strong game for Harvard, recording 12 points, seven rebounds, and five assists against NC A&T. The Wellesley, Mass., native was named to the Cavalier Classic All-Tournament team following Sunday’s win over the Aggies.
Although the Crimson came a basket short of playing in Sunday’s final, the weekend was still a promising road trip for a team looking to convert early season success into its first Ivy League title in 10 seasons.
“It was definitely encouraging to contend against a good ACC team and to beat NC A&T,” Benzan said. “But it also showed us how good we can be if we control turnovers and offensive rebounds. We have so much room to improve.”

Most of us went home, some hopped over to New York City, and a handful stayed on campus over the Thanksgiving break. Let’s recount the ways in which we took a much needed breather from classes.
Posting pictures to our snap stories
Almost every one of us is guilty of this act. At some point during the break we took an artsy picture of our home or some new place we visited, chose a cute filter, and added a location stamp. If you’re like me and didn’t go home over the break, you’ll know what I mean when I say feelings of nostalgia and loneliness took over after seeing a plethora of these snaps.
Crying over reading period
We’re all in denial if we say we didn’t once think about how reading period and finals are rapidly approaching. This might get ugly real fast.
Turkey overload
After the initial Thanksgiving feast, the leftovers abound. Turkey sandwiches, turkey soup, turkey casserole, turkey on toast…you name it. I personally need a couple of months to recover, and feel guilty about looking the Harvard Turkey in the eye.
Reuniting with family
Ahh, the abundance of awkward hugs and kisses from hovering aunts. Still, being back with the fam, and temporarily spoiled for the week, reminds us we love them despite their overbearing tendencies.
Black Friday sales
Whether out fighting crowds at our local mall, or clicking through a cart in the comfort of our beds, we were blessed with numerous steals and discounts this break. Watch out for our new fur vest’s campus debut.
Now that Thanksgiving is over, let us rejoice over guilt-free Mariah jam seshes and basic fairy lights. Winter season is upon us!

The residents of Currier House are making way for ducklings.
When Timothy H. C. Tamm '18 first spotted the small plastic ducks in the fountain of Currier House dining hall in October, the ducks were few in number.   Before long, however, “a hundred tiny baby ducks appeared there, and then the medium-sized duck in the tree appeared,” Tamm said. “And then I figured, if it’s worth doing, it’s worth overdoing.”
After realizing that his plan would be prohibitively expensive for one man to pursue alone, Tamm started a GoFundMe to raise the $220 needed to purchase a six-foot inflatable duck.  In what Tamm describes as a “display of Currier unity,” he reached the fundraising goal in just two days.
Support for the ducks extends beyond the student population of the House.  “The House administration thought that we should have a formal competition to name the duck,” Tamm said, adding that administrators also floated a vote on the issue of making the duck a co-mascot of Currier House.  
The duck arrived on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break and, according to Tamm, took four people to inflate with a small pump.  However, administrator concerns for the safety of the duck led to a temporary relocation for the duration of break.  “They locked this up over Thanksgiving break because they didn’t want it to get stolen. It’s a big deal in the House,” Shao Zhao ‘18 said.
“It kind of reminds me of this art installation, this huge duck that floats on some body of water around the world,” Zhao said, while expressing concern that the duck is located in the “one part of the d-hall with light.”
On the issue of making the duck a house mascot, “I don’t know if we can do away with the tree like that, you know?” Ifedayo B. Famojuro ‘19 said.
Joseph Exilhome, a Harvard University Dining Services worker who usually staffs Currier’s dining hall, said the duck is “a little odd.” The HUDS staff were not warned in advance about the duck’s appearance. “The whole thing’s just funny,” Exilhome said, adding that the duck “eases the mood up.”
The duck is a recent arrival, but Tamm hopes that it will become a mainstay of Currier House life.  “If I come back for my 20th reunion, I want to see the duck there,” Tamm said.  In the nearer-term, Tamm estimates that the duck will require “a few pumps every week” to keep inflated.
Perhaps this Housing Day, Currier residents will be shouting “fear the duck” throughout the dorms of Harvard Yard.

As the school year rolls on, increasingly events come up that require a date. If you’re like us and feel personally attacked every time you see an invitation that kindly suggests you bring a date, look no further. We’ve assembled the perfect tips to help you find the perfect date.
Put your stalking skills to good use
We know you’re actually scrolling through Facebook when you text your blockmates that you’re “studying at Lamont.” Your stalking abilities are top notch, so what are you waiting for? Send a daring message to that person you friended on Facebook during Visitas who has that really cute profile picture (yes, we know it’s from prom two years ago, but they can’t have changed that much, right?).
Stalking skills, continued
If social media fails you, you may need to take some more drastic measures. Hell, dust off that Freshman Register that your mom made you buy. There’s a reason why the index is alphabetized by first name. Another pro tip: take advantage of the sports rosters. Think about it for a moment: the headshots of every single athlete here are easily accessible on the Internet, along with random, cute facts about their high school “careers.”
Harvard’s digital tools
Do not underestimate the power of the Internet. And what’s more wholesome than sending a lighthearted message to your target via Canvas? We won’t blame you if you “accidentally” send one to your TF as well.
Dating apps
We’re not proud either, but sometimes you just have to use them. Lure in that wide-eyed student from BC/Northeastern/Wellesley with the false promise of a rare Harvard rager, then bring them along to your event. Just prepare a charming made-up story of how you met.
Good old in-person
You only live once, so take a risk. Approach your section/entryway/d-hall/MAC crush and pop the question. You’ll come off as awkward in the most adorable way, and they’ll at least be flattered that you thought of them. Better yet, ask all four of the aforementioned people. This is a selective school after all.
Considering that cuffing season is already in full force, we can’t guarantee that any of the above will work. After all, why are you even taking advice from us? Flyby writers are lonely too. On second thought, what are you doing next weekend? ;)
