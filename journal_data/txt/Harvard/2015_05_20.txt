After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although dystopias are in vogue, partly as a byproduct of the boom in popularity of young adult fiction, most mainstream portrayals of dystopia ultimately rely on similar genre clichés, such as the good-evil binary between faceless, authoritarian governments and rebellious, free-thinking youth. “The Lobster” quite contrarily explores the importance of having a middle ground in such binaries, its unique premise being that all single people in society must find a partner within 45 days or they will be permanently transformed into an animal of their choosing. From Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos—also known for the lurid and provocative “Canine (Dogtooth)”—the cleverly written film is a hilarious, understated black comedy that explores the dangerous ramifications of in-group bias and conforming to labels.
Colin Farrell stars as David, a recent widower who is sent to The Hotel to find a new partner within the designated time limit. Once there, he befriends two other single men—played by John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw—and engages in brief romantic encounters with some of the women—played by Jessica Barden and Angeliki Papoulia. By leaving all of these characters nameless—for instance, Reilly’s character is called Lisping Man while Barden’s is named Nosebleed Woman—Lanthimos and script co-writer Efthimis Filippou make an explicit statement on how our identities can easily and problematically be reduced to specific characteristics that define us.
Throughout Hotel-organized dances, seminars, and daily hunts for single people, David fails to completely assimilate into the culture of The Hotel and find a partner. Later in the film, he also fails to fully conform to the solitary, electronic dance music-oriented lifestyle of a renegade band of single people led by a character played by Léa Seydoux. The stakes are raised when he forms a forbidden relationship with a fellow loner (played by Rachel Weisz) against the rules of their outsider society. Seydoux’s deadpan portrayal of the heartless Loner Leader, combined with the romantic chemistry between Farrell and Weisz, shifts this slow-burn comedy-drama into high gear during the film’s third act.
Through these two opposing factions, Lanthimos and Filippou explore the question of what it means to truly belong. Can a relationship be founded solely upon the fact that two people are both shortsighted or prone to nosebleeds? Is it worth sacrificing individuality for the sake of belonging—whether to a society of couples or of single people, within a relationship with one other person, or to any group in general? The film’s shocking conclusion leaves that final judgment ambiguous—but not without demonstrating the legitimate dangers of blindly conforming. It seems that there are much worse things than being turned into a lobster

Incomparably stylish and well-paced, Woody Allen’s newest film “Irrational Man” concludes the writer-director’s “Dostoyevsky trilogy” and marks a personal best in his career. Loosely based on the Russian author’s novel “Crime and Punishment” (which is directly referenced in the film), “Irrational Man” stars Joaquin Phoenix as the existentially depressed, philandering, alcoholic philosophy professor Abe Lucas at Braylin College, a New England liberal arts university. Emma Stone plays Jill Pollard, an intelligent student of Abe’s who becomes infatuated with his intelligence, sophistication, and detached personality.
Although the film is narrated from the perspectives of Abe and Jill via voice-over, it still manages to strike a delicate balance between insightful and overwrought. Allen’s impeccable writing places the audience directly into the heads of his characters, while the constantly recurring jazz riff of The Ramsey Lewis Trio's "The In Crowd" serves as the film’s rhythmic backbone.
Phoenix’s character is that of the archetypal emotionally broken intellectual, but his idiosyncrasies bring nuance and life to a stock role. By the film’s second act, after Abe and Jill overhear a conversation that forever alters his meaningless existence, Phoenix effects a dramatic transformation of his character into a meticulous sociopath. Meanwhile, Stone’s performance extends beyond her initial wide-eyed, feigned innocence into serious dramatic territory, as her character is forced to confront serious realities by the film’s conclusion. The clear chemistry between the two actors is what carries the film: Their sexual tension, intellectual rapport, and moral disagreements serve as the crux of conflict.
Throughout the film, Abe constantly discusses the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the importance of situational ethics in comparison to Kant’s categorical imperative. Luck is another particularly important theme—one striking scene has Abe pull the trigger of a six-chamber revolver five times in a row during a game of Russian roulette. Even as Abe makes a life-changing decision during the film’s second act, Allen manages to maintain the film’s upbeat tone. Whether he ultimately endorses Abe’s situational ethics or Kant’s categorical imperative is unclear—the many twists and turns of the film’s ending are strongly influenced by mere chance. Regardless of one’s philosophical bent, the sheer pleasure of riding along through “Irrational Man” is incontrovertible—like Abe, the film just has a certain inexplicable charm.

Note: "Arabian Nights" is a three-part film. This review only discusses the first, titled "Volume I: The Restless One."
Contrary to the suggestion of the title, “Arabian Nights” is not set in the distant past and surprisingly has nothing to do with Arabia. In fact, it is about current economic and political crisis of Portugal. However, director Miguel Gomes cleverly puts this commentary into a collection of funny, surreal tales that are told in a similar fashion with the “One Thousand Nights and One Night” folktale collection, splitting the story into three volumes, each containing three tales for an aggregated run time of approximately six hours.
This narrative architecture is interesting in itself, but the execution is what makes the film fantastic. In the Godardesque beginning, the film cuts back and forth between shots of an old shipyard, news reports of the shipyard being closed and workers’ reactions, and on-set recordings of the director himself making another movie. The voiceover throughout this part tells the audience how Gomes is deeply concerned with the reality in Portugal while he is making another movie and how he suddenly flees away from the set to explore the social problems in his country, leaving his crew bewildered. This narration is to some extent a documentary of how he started “Arabian Nights.” While in reality he never escaped from its set, he did abandon an ongoing project and hired two journalists to do research on the social problems in Portugal. He later based his stories on these findings.
Following this beginning, however, “Arabian Nights” has little to do with realism. It radically changed the materials provided by the journalists into Kafkaesque absurd tales. Each deals with one real aspect of Portuguese society but adds a taste of mysticism. In the first story, for instance, a special team from the likes of IMF and European Commission come to Portugal to research its economic situation, and encounter a wizard in the desert who gives them a cure for impotence. However, while the medicine gives these middle-aged men their long lost erectile vitality, it is so powerful that their erections never end, causing them to suffer from the supposed gift. As they turn to the wizard for an antidote, he asks for several billion euros. Following stories feature a rooster that changes the result of an election and a tree that talks, but all these take place in a world that seems otherwise completely normal—Portugal as it is right now.
“Arabian Nights” is devastatingly refreshing and fascinating, even among the many first-class films that debut at a top-flight film festival like Cannes, and it is  hilarious. However, it is unclear to what extent these tales are just funny stories told in an auteur style or to what extent they really have deep meanings behind them. While all of the stories have a particular social background, it sometimes feels as if the social issues only serve as a backdrop and nothing more. In any case, the world depicted in “Arabian Nights”—however much it is or is not related to reality—is sophisticated and enchanting.
“Arabian Nights” is perhaps the weirdest film at this year’s Festival de Cannes, and among the funniest. Only time will tell, however, if the film will become an all-time classic or collect dust on the shelf, regarded purely as a high-quality offbeat satire.

As exemplified by Asghar Farhadi’s Academy Award-winning 2011 movie “A Separation,” Iranian realist films have experienced Western popularization in recent years. Ida Panahandeh’s debut film “Nahid” is the most recent in this group of films, and while it might not be as shocking as “A Separation,” it is still a sharp and poignant piece that captures some of the most important social issues in its country.
“Nahid” focuses on women’s rights in what many regard as a conservative and highly patriarchal society. The film follows the story of Nahid (Sareh Bayat), a divorcée with an increasingly ungrateful and rebellious son (Navid Mohammadzadeh), as she struggles to pay both her rent and her son’s tuition with the humble salary that she earns from her job as a typist. She is pursued by Masoud (Pejman Bazeghi), a well-off and gentle middle-aged man who promises to save her from her financial troubles. Nevertheless, although Nahid also has feelings for Masoud, it is forbidden by law for her to have custody over her son if she remarries. Cornered by social expectations and the law, she has to make a choice between her son and her lover.
While the premise of the film is something very dry—a law clause—it manages to portray a bigger picture of the problems in Iranian society. As the audience follows Nahid’s painstaking search for help, her story exposes the influence of Islam in daily life, the harmfulness of Iran’s patriarchal system, and the social violence that ensues from poverty. For instance, an important subplot of the film is the fall of Nahid’s son. While at the beginning of the movie he is just a misbehaving child who does not pay attention to his schoolwork, he learns about the power of money as he hangs around the street and is taught to acquire it in fast but dangerous ways. At the story’s end, he is involved in gangs, and it is suggested that he will end up with a life similar to that of his violent, unaccompanied father and thousands of other ne’er-do-wells in modern Iran.
Another virtue of “Nahid” is that it is not overly didactic, and subplots unfold naturally as the story progresses. While it is evident that the director holds a political and moral position on the social phenomena depicted in the film, she also tries to present different aspects of the Iranian society in a realistic, objective way. On some occasions, however, the structure of the film is a bit loose; the director seems to be presenting what she sees indiscriminately, and the film tends to go stray from its most important topic.
As a debut film, “Nahid” is surprisingly mature and gives a vivid and realistic representation of a mother struggling within social restrains. It invites the audience to share Nahid’s worries, happiness, and troubles, and to ponder broader questions about modern societies.

Italian director Nanni Moretti is a regular at Cannes, and in 2001, he won the Palme d’Or with “La Chambre du fils.” This year, he returns with the semi-autobiographical “Mia madre” (English “My Mother”), a piece so masterful in its style and so intimate in its emotion that it may earn a second Palme d’Or in Moretti’s career.
“Mia madre” focuses on a veteran female director named Margherita (Margherita Buy) and is split quite distinctively into three parts. The first follows the development of Margherita’s new film, which tells the story of factory workers protesting against a layoff ordered by the company’s new owner. The second part is centered on the troubled shooting of the film, in which the leading actor Barry Huggins (John Turturro) is not only an alcoholic but also never remembers his lines. The third part, and the core of the movie, shows the worsening health situation of Margherita’s mother, who may die at any time. All these are threaded together by the brilliant performance of Buy, whose interpretation of Margherita is both relatable and reserved.
Margherita’s psychological development under the stress from both her professional and personal life is the heart of the story, and the director presents it using a mixture of her real life events and surreal dream sequences. The first is exemplified by a scene where bad news about her mother’s health arrives to the set when she is shooting her film. Overwhelmed and in deep pain, she tells the crew in a trembling but determined voice that they will continue shooting. However, as soon as the shooting starts, she gives in to pressure and runs away. This delicate and empathetic scene is matched by a dream sequence earlier in the film, where Margherita walks past a line in front of a cinema showing “Wings of Desire,” and people she knows in the queue (including her mother) approach and ask her why she cannot make a film people are interested in or when her new film will be finished. Great scenes like these not only build the character, but also tint the whole film with a nostalgic, melancholic atmosphere.
With a well-written screenplay and a nuanced performance, “Mia madre” is clearly a beautiful film with a lasting charm. Once again, it proves Moretti’s status as the greatest living representative of Italian cinema.

Focusing on the troubled marriage between an uptight lawyer and a lovable cad, "Mon Roi" tells a rather common and clichéd love story in French cinema, rooted in the deep-seated conflict between these two stock character types. Although at times overwrought with melodrama, the film ultimately presents a moving portrait of a relationship through strong performances by its two leads, Vincent Cassel and Emmanuelle Bercot (the latter's film "La Tête Haute" also opened Cannes this year).
The story is presented from the perspective of Tony (Bercot) as she undergoes physical therapy after a skiing accident. We're introduced to a physically and emotionally broken character several years after the conclusion of her taxing relationship with Georgio (Cassel)—and as her therapist dubiously puts it, her physical healing process is likely to spur some level of emotional catharsis as well. Cue flashbacks.
Despite the initial weakness of this narrative device, the scenes from her past relationship are wonderfully written. From Tony and Georgio's first meeting in a nightclub to their eventual child and marriage, director and co-writer Maïwenn lulls the viewer into a trance with the unabashed optimism of the first act. Cassel and Bercot have a wonderful chemistry during these charming first scenes—but it is during the later erosion of their marriage that their dramatic skill truly shines.
