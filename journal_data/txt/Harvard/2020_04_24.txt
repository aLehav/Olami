After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the day before Earth Day, Harvard announced a new “net-zero” by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions policy for its endowment. While it is about time Harvard acknowledges that the endowment is — as students, faculty, and alumni have been saying for years — an appropriate tool to achieve societal goals like climate action, the proposal was disappointing in its process, presentation, and policy.
From a process perspective, the Harvard Corporation chose to make this decision in a black box with little to no formal stakeholder engagement. By contrast, in 2008, when I was a graduate student at Harvard, I was appointed by former University President Drew G. Faust to a task force composed of leading faculty, staff, and students who were involved in a cross-university coalition pushing for climate action. This task force met weekly over a semester and issued a formal recommendation that was then accepted and acted upon by the administration. Yet this time — even after multiple student referenda, a faculty vote, and alumni petitions have enthusiastically endorsed divestment — instead of engaging these stakeholders in a thoughtful decision-making process, Harvard heard these calls for divestment, ignored them, and decided to do something completely different.
That process failure bled into Harvard’s failed presentation of this proposal. Despite the fact that students, faculty, and alumni have been calling on the University to divest from fossil fuels for eight years, Harvard’s announcement did not properly acknowledge the work done by its constituents to push Harvard to align its investments with its values. Harvard may have made this announcement near Earth Day expecting praise and celebration for its leadership, but it should not be surprised to find little of either from the students, faculty, and staff who have long been calling on Harvard to pick a side in this most timely of struggles for a livable planet.
Most egregiously, Harvard’s proposal fails as a matter of policy. By refusing to immediately and directly divest its holdings of fossil fuel stocks — a step taken by Brown University, the University of Oxford, and the University of California system, among others — Harvard ignores the question of responsibility for this crisis we find ourselves in. The primary culprit is the fossil fuel industry, which has been deliberately spreading misinformation, directly combatting the extensive research and scholarship that Harvard’s faculty have been working on for decades, and aggressively lobbying against climate policies that could have allowed for a gradual decarbonization. Rather than stand up for science and “Veritas,” Harvard is instead choosing to coddle the bullies and deniers. It is saying that all parties have equal roles to play in a problem that the fossil fuel companies created and continue to worsen.
Harvard couches its actions and hides behind the legitimacy of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Paris Climate Agreement is a flawed treaty that recognizes that we “aspire” to keep global temperature rise this century to what scientists say is the highest safe level of warming (1.5 degrees Celsius), but whose total commitments pledged under Paris would see twice that — if countries actually honored their obligations. The IPCC, on the other hand, reported that if we want even a 50 percent chance of avoiding the catastrophic consequences of exceeding a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, global emissions must be cut in half by 2030 and ended by 2050.
There are several problems with Harvard’s proposed commitment to have our endowment achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050. First, in science we care about the “stock,” or total amount, of emissions in the atmosphere, not the “flow,” the amount we put up in a single year. So getting our 2050 targets right without similarly aligning the much more important — and more easily accountable — 2030 targets largely ignores the IPCC’s core recommendations. Second, if Harvard wants this to be seen as leadership, then the University must do more than what is being asked of every institution and nation in the world. Doing the bare minimum to get by is a C grade at best. Finally, Harvard cannot and should not content itself with science that only allows a 50 percent chance of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. Harvard would not say it had done its job at an educational institution if students had a 50 percent chance of finding a job after graduation, so why would accepting a 50 percent chance at a livable planet count as moral leadership?
University President Lawrence S. Bacow took bold and decisive action in response to COVID-19, and helped save lives in the process by using Harvard’s bully pulpit to accelerate other institutions’ estimation of the threat. So it is all the more tragic that when faced with a crisis Harvard’s scientists have been warning about for half a century, President Bacow has not acted with similar courage or leadership. For the past eight years, students, faculty, and alumni have been calling on Harvard to stand on the side of scientists and marginalized communities and young people that will face the brunt of climate burdens, instead of the side of fossil fuel companies.
Instead, Harvard has once again passed up its mantle of leadership. This net-zero by 2050 policy tries to have it both ways, and fails on all counts. If the Corporation thinks the proposal will quiet calls for divestment, they are sorely mistaken. We will not go away until Harvard comes to terms with its responsibilities and revokes the social license its investments in fossil fuel companies continue to provide.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduation is something close to sacred for many Pacific Islander communities.
Whether it’s a middle school, high school, or college graduation, you will be sure to see cars packed with cousins, aunties, uncles, parents, and grandparents rolling into the parking lot. Their arms will be full of candy and flower leis as they walk to where the ceremony is being held, struggling to find free hands to carry the money-plastered, cardboard headpieces shaped like a tuiga. Underneath the graduation robes, Pasefika graduates proudly show off their traditional dress ranging from the Samoan puletasi to the Tongan ta’ovala. But the actual graduation ceremony is just the beginning, as families load back into their cars afterwards with their graduates to continue the celebration either at home, a local restaurant, or anywhere big enough to host the entire family and the festivities to ensue.
As we are approaching the end of the school year, I can’t help but think about all of my Pasefika graduates who are struggling to finish school while quarantined at home, or the Pasefika graduates who aren’t even able to get home because of travel restrictions. I can’t help but think of all of the aunties, uncles, parents, and grandparents who have sacrificed everything to put their children through school, only to be stripped of the opportunity to finally see their beautiful Pasefika children walk across the stage after their names are probably mispronounced by the announcer. And I can’t help but think of my own little brother, a current senior in high school, who I won’t be able to ambush with the candy leis that my mom and I would have probably spent all night making.
To all of my Pasefika graduates, I know that you were looking forward to being buried in leis to the point where you would have had trouble breathing. I know that you were looking forward to hearing your cousins scream “Cheehoo!” so loudly that you could barely hear the announcer call out your own name. And I know that you were looking forward to your grandma and aunties pushing you into the center to dance for the entire family at the post-graduation celebration.
But know that even though you might not be getting the graduation that you’ve been dreaming of — and the one that you’ve been working so hard towards — your efforts will not go unrecognized. We see you, and we will continue to celebrate you, because your graduation means so much more than just a culmination of the tests that you have passed and the assignments you’ve completed. It symbolizes the blood, sweat, and tears that your family and ancestors before you sacrificed in order for you to be where you are today. Your graduation is a mark of the strength of Pasefika — that you not only managed to survive but were able to excel in an institution that has been premised on the erasure of your histories. But most of all, it is a beacon of hope for challenging the common misconceptions of our people as “primitive” and for correcting and rewriting our own narratives.
This celebration of you is not to be taken as an absence of critiquing the ways in which the educational system has so often failed us. We cannot forget the ways in which the Western educational system has not considered our ways of knowing as valid knowledge production. We cannot excuse the ways in which it has brainwashed us into thinking that our islands and our people are only created for military use. And we most definitely cannot turn a blind eye to the ways in which the educational system allows for our students to slip through the cracks so easily — with only 18 percent of the Pacific Islander adult population holding a bachelor’s degree.
With that said though, the failures of the educational system do not negate your success and do not mean that you are not to be celebrated. Just because school systems have never served in our best interests does not mean that your participation and completion of school is to be considered a betrayal of your people. Because what other choice were you given? You weren’t given many, and that is why we celebrate you. We celebrate you because your ingenuity in accomplishing the amazing feat of graduation despite only the very few resources allotted to you — an ingenuity you inherited from your ancestors who used nothing but the stars to sail across the Pacific. We celebrate you because of your creativity in reimagining and redefining your own histories through storytelling, something that was passed on from your grandparents and that your schools could never teach you. And we celebrate you purely because of your existence, which in itself is a symbol of resilience and resistance against all of the messaging and images that have tried to instill in you a sense of unworthiness since childhood.
So be proud of yourselves, Pasefika graduates, because you have and continue to accomplish the impossible. And even though we won’t be showing up to your graduations — competing with other families to see who has the loudest “Cheehoo!” and who brought the best leis — know that we still see you, love you, and will continue to celebrate you.

If you glaze a cake donut too quickly after it leaves the fryer, it will fall apart. If you wait too long, it will dry thick like frosting on the donut’s surface. You have to wait for exactly the right moment, when the donut is just warm enough for the glaze to penetrate its outer layer and form a thin, sweet crust around it. By the time I park my car and walk through the back door into the kitchen, the overnight bakers, Matt and Jose, have been hard at work, frying and glazing for hours.
I arrive at 2:30 a.m. on the dot, depositing my keys and bag on a side table before sliding my paper timecard into the ancient punch-clock. While the town around me sleeps, I put in my headphones and dance around the dimly-lit restaurant brewing coffee, filling cash registers, and stuffing box after box with what travel writers at Huffpost named one of “The Dozen Best Donuts in America.”
That was my weekend morning routine at Mrs. Murphy’s Donuts, an Irish-themed, Southwick, Mass. institution opened by Earl and Rose Murphy in 1976. The shop boasts an almost mythical status in rural New England, attracting locals and leaf-peepers alike with the promise of a cup of coffee and a homemade donut for the small price of two dollars and 50 cents — but only if they’re willing to do without the to-go cup, sit down, and stay awhile. My mother first tried to secure a job for me at the shop when I was just 13. Much to her chagrin (and to the credit of child labor laws), the shop did not hire middle schoolers.
The way my mother saw it, working at Murphy’s was my birthright. It was the closest I ever came to being a legacy applicant, and I wasn’t even a member of the place’s titular family. My older sister worked at the shop as a teenager in the ’90s, forcing my father to wake up at 5:00 a.m. on many a Saturday or Sunday morning to ensure that she hauled her hungover body out of bed and into her car in time for her shift. My older brother did a brief stint at Murphy’s as well, but as a mopper. I had no money, no car, and no prior work experience when the Murphy family finally broke down and hired me at age 15. I used the promise of free donuts to incentivize upperclassmen with driver’s licenses to drop me off for my after-school closing shifts. I’d bag them a few donuts before hurrying back into the restaurant to wait on my beloved — albeit demanding — afternoon regulars.
Jen took her coffee with milk and one Sweet’N Low, iced in the summer. I handed her the pink packet, grabbing two Equals for Bruce before rushing to the donut rack for his glazed jelly stick and ice water with a plastic straw. Will took his coffee black with two Splenda and George usually asked for a milkshake, but only if Suzy was working (which she usually was). If not, he’d have a coffee and a bagel with extra cream cheese or a hot dog with raw onions, not grilled. I’d hand Lucy, a nurse practitioner, her cinnamon twist and cup of tea just in time to hear her chide George for his order — after all, he recently suffered a stroke. I identified my regulars by their orders long before I learned their names. They called me “Red” before they learned mine.
I spent more time with my regulars than with some of my closest friends. On birthdays, one might bring a cake for a fellow regular and ask us to hide it in the back. Some of my coworkers found it silly that they brought dessert to a donut shop, but I didn’t mind. Without Murphy’s, there would be nowhere else to go. They fashioned a family table out of a donut shop counter and for four years I stood in the center. I watched them come and go, leaving behind exact change and empty mugs. When I returned from my first year of college, one of the faces was missing. When I returned from my second year of college, I didn’t visit. One by one, they are disappearing, taking the memories of my counter days with them.
I am not ready to be the only one who remembers. A “Murphy’s girl” no more, I often wonder who I am to the baristas at the coffee shops I frequent now. Am I the redhead who orders a small iced coffee, black? Am I the girl who lingers a little too long at the counter? If I turn around, walk out the door, and never come back, will anyone notice that I am gone? I reach my arm across the counter to hand over my debit card or to drop a dollar in the tip jar; I try to send a message with my eyes, with the slight touch of skin to skin before the ding of the credit card machine tells me it is time to go. I was once you, I want to say. I think some part of me always will be.

It was springtime on Harvard’s campus. The sun was shining, the Yard was bustling with students in t-shirts and shorts, and campus felt worlds away from the frosty winter that had relinquished its grasp on Cambridge only weeks earlier. But any sense of hope or new beginnings didn’t extend beyond the physical setting of campus during the spring of 1970 — while the flowers were in full bloom, the Vietnam War also was raging.
Carl F. Muller ’73, a freshman at the time, references the first line of “A Tale of Two Cities” to explain the spring 1970 semester: “It was the best of times; it was the worst of times.” Amid the beauty of springtime, the anti-war movement was ripping through the country.
On May 4 of that year, during a protest at Kent State University, the Ohio National Guard shot at unarmed students and killed four of them.
Soon after the shooting, Harvard announced that students had the option to skip their final exams and have their classes graded on a pass-fail system for the semester. They also had the options to to stay, finishing their exams for a letter grade or skip them and still accept letter grades. A Crimson article published soon after the decision lists a flurry of announcements from professors detailing the next steps for their students.
Until this year, the spring of 1970 appears to be the only semester in Harvard’s history during which the College offered a schoolwide pass-fail option. Now, the spring 2020 semester has become the second. The circumstances surrounding each decision, however, are more different than they are similar.
One primary difference is the catalyst for making the pass-fail decision. “The reason to shut the school down was so that we could go home and work for peace,” Muller explains. “It wasn’t to shut the school down because we were angry; it wasn’t to shut the school down because we wanted to somehow make a statement — it was to shut the school down so that we could actually do something about the war.”
While Harvard’s decision might appear to be politically motivated, Harry B. Wilson Jr. ’67, a Vietnam War veteran, did not perceive it that way. “When Kent State happened, there was a reaction all over the country,” he says. “All the universities were taking similar actions to what Harvard was doing. Harvard was hardly alone. So yeah, it was political, but it also wasn’t. The anti-war movement was, by then, a huge figure.”
Another key difference between the springs of 1970 and 2020 is that the University’s decisions incited different reactions from the public. When the administration notified students of their decision to effectively close the campus in 2020, the administration faced a backlash from students, parents, and the general public.
In response to the decision, Harvard parents started a petition that reads, “Parents of Harvard College students disagree with the College [sic] unilateral decision to close its facilities to students and to send them home. In these unprecedented times students should be allowed uninterrupted access to college education and college services.” That same week, there was also a petition started by Harvard freshmen demanding the preservation of an on-campus Housing Day, even if it were slightly modified.
The decision in 1970 was not nearly as controversial. “There were some people, including friends of mine, who supported the war,” Muller recalls. “Some people thought that Harvard closing the university and allowing students to go home was ill-advised, but I would say that was a very small minority.”
Perhaps this was because the announcement was made in May instead of March or because students had more control over their academic fates. “The most important thing at that time in people’s minds was putting a stop to the war and not spending time studying microbes and the Renaissance,” Muller says. “It seemed almost selfish to be doing that when there was such carnage.”
As with all tragedies, some Harvard students were more deeply affected by the Vietnam War than others. Among them was Wilson, who had taken time off from school and enlisted amid the brutal Tet Offensive of 1968. When he returned to campus in 1969, eager to resume his studies, he showed up in full military uniform to re-register for classes. “[Students] absolutely freaked when I came in in full uniform,” says Wilson. The experience he gained from Vietnam offered him a different perspective on the anti-war protests he witnessed on campus. As someone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, he says that even today the war continues to occupy his thoughts.
“[Thinking about fighting in the war] is not disabling, but it’s something I think about all the time,” he says. “Even though it’s more than 50 years old, I still think about it every day.”
Wilson’s experience of the Vietnam War fundamentally changed the way he understood campus — and the world. Though Harvard students’ experiences today are vastly different from Wilson’s, perhaps when they return to campus — whenever that may be — they will also find their own perspectives colored by the aftermath of their abridged spring semester.

“Nothing is more important than protecting ourselves and our families — especially during these times of uncertainty,” reads the first line of the National Rifle Association’s COVID-19 webpage. The website identifies the states that have ordered gun dealerships to close for public health purposes and informs readers that the NRA has filed lawsuits against each one. “We will work diligently,” the organization promises, “to ensure that you are able to defend yourself and your family during these unprecedented times.”
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to escalate, firearms sales in the U.S. have jumped. The FBI conducted 3.7 million firearms background checks last March — the highest month on record since they began collecting data in 1998. Five states have closed gun stores in the wake of the pandemic, defying the federal government’s recommendation that deems gun dealers “essential” businesses. In the rest of the country, lines outside gun stores stretch around street corners.
“I think a lot of this has to do with a fear of the indeterminacy and the effect this pandemic will have on civil society,” says Caroline Light, a Harvard senior lecturer on studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality whose research focuses largely on Americans’ relationship to lethal self-defense. Spikes in civil gun purchases often accompany moments of uncertainty or instability, such as periods of economic distress or widespread layoffs, Light explains. “As we see the social capacities of the government eroding, we see more and more people asking this question of, ‘How am I going to survive?’”
Anxiety around decreased law enforcement presence seems to play a central role in stoking the gun surge, Light says. With many first responders testing positive for the novel coronavirus, police stations throughout the country have had to operate at limited capacity. “There’s this growing idea that police officers can’t always be there when you need them,” Light says, “and people are feeling more precarious in terms of defending their homes and property.”
Light continues, “You’re seeing sort of this fear of lawlessness.”
David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, says he isn’t especially alarmed by the spike. Hemenway, who authored the book “Private Guns, Public Health,” explains that this particular increase of a couple million purchases might be lost among the U.S.’s existing 390 million guns. Nonetheless, considering the 39,444 firearm-related deaths in 2019, Hemenway says, “the evidence is overwhelming that more guns cause more gun problems.”
Hemenway’s chief concern is potential increase in first-time gun owners, rather than the sheer hike in guns purchased. “Whether you have four, five, or ten guns in your home probably doesn’t matter a lot. The question is zero or one,” he explains.
In Massachusetts, first-time gun owners are the plaintiffs in a lawsuit aiming to reverse the state’s decision to shutter gun stores. A couple who purchased a gun in March for self-protection cite their situation — and, in particular, their growing doubt in the capacity of law enforcement — as evidence of the “essential” nature of gun stores. “[The couple is] aware that break-ins are common in their community, and they are concerned that they would be unable to protect themselves should the need arise and emergency services were unavailable or not reliably available,” the lawsuit reads. “They decided to purchase a gun and ammunition to protect themselves.”
Individual patrons of gun stores aren’t the only ones responding to this climate of uncertainty — the NRA has also emphasized crisis-induced indeterminacy in its advocacy for the Second Amendment. “The only reliable self-defense during a crisis is the #2A,” reads a tweet posted to the organization’s Twitter page on March 21. The NRA’s “COVID-19” webpage appeals to the public’s doubt in law enforcement, emphasizing the importance of civil gun ownership “against a backdrop of reported prisoner furloughs and law enforcement only arresting for the most serious of crimes.”
As for the impact of this surge, Light points out that consequences could be especially grave for certain at-risk populations in quarantine. Victims of intimate partner violence, for instance, are particularly vulnerable. “Quarantine sticks people together in close quarters,” Light says. “Adding a gun to that equation, I worry, has the potential to make that even more toxic.”
While Hemenway believes March’s spike is a mere drop in the nation’s pool of guns, he raises concerns about fear acting as a catalyst for unsafe storage of guns — and, consequently, increased risk for domestic violence involving guns. He advises gun owners to lock guns in safes, to store them unloaded, and to store ammunition separately. If people “who currently store their guns unloaded and locked up are suddenly more afraid and start leaving around guns which are loaded and unlocked, that’s real bad for the family.”
Despite public health risks, Americans continue to flock to gun stores as the crisis persists. “Anxiety sells,” says Light. “Anxiety and fear are super lucrative as marketing tools... Firearms in particular have benefitted in terms of sales from a widespread systematic marketization of fear.”
The bottom of the NRA’s COVID-19 webpage links to a video entitled “Disabled Woman Weak to Coronavirus Issues Message to Politicians Using Pandemic to Push Gun Control.” In the video, breast cancer survivor Carletta Whiting encourages Americans to buy guns for self-protection, highlighting a national atmosphere of indeterminacy and instability.
“I hope I survive the coronavirus. That’s up to God,” Whiting says into the camera, cradling a firearm. “What’s in my control is how I defend myself if things go from bad to worse.”

Getting quadded is something that happens to other people, like getting Ad-boarded or contracting an STI. I did everything right: I had a small blocking group and no linkmates, I did virtual river run (this is just getting blackout drunk and clicking around campus on Google Earth), I personally asked David Laibson to put me in Lowell during his one-on-one office hours, I bribed all the right university administrators — you name it, I did it.
Then, the time came — Friday, April 12, 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time. I eagerly chat with my blockmates in a Zoom waiting room. Suddenly we are pulled into the main Zoom call to discover our future house. As the Zoom room loads, we can see that they are screen sharing some music video, and I hear the first few beats to a song I can’t recognize. After a few seconds, I make out the first few words of the song, “The house surrounding Quad lawn, only in Cabot.”
“Fuck,” I think. “This cannot be happening.” More accurately, “This can’t be happening to me!” I wait a few more seconds to ensure that this is not, in fact, some sick joke and that I really did just get quadded. After refreshing my browser and rejoining the call it seems I am still in Cabot. I can’t tell you what happens on the call next because I angrily slam my laptop shut and throw myself onto my bed.
Face buried in my pillows, I try really hard not to cry — one, because I don’t want to further perpetuate the stereotype of freshmen who get quadded and then cry about it, and two, because I am deeply insecure and I think any open display of emotion is a sign of weakness and therefore a threat to my masculinity.
After 45 minutes lying face down, successfully repressing my emotions, I decide I need to do something to make myself feel better. I land on riding my bike — a good chance to get some exercise, take my mind off things, and practice my grueling new commute.
Thankfully, I live in the part of northern California where right-wing militias and ranches outnumber software engineers and Teslas, so there is plenty of wide-open space for me to ride my bike in the woods while maintaining social distance.
But riding my bike until I forget that I got quadded is not working. I am listening to “Spikes” by Death Grips so loudly that I can’t hear my own thoughts, but I still can’t shake the overwhelming feeling of, “Oh my god, is this karma for destroying the IKEA coffee table my roommate bought out of spite and then posting it on Tik Tok?”
As the bike ride goes on, I grow more and more indignant –– living a fabulously privileged life up until this point has left me ill-suited to deal with hardship as massive as this.
As my outrage at the cosmic injustice of being quadded after already living in Pennypacker for a year reaches a fever pitch, I turn a corner and see a middle-aged couple walking towards me over a rocky, uphill section of the trail. Suddenly on my left, I see their large black dog barking and running at me. In an effort not to hit the dog, I keep my eyes on him and drift to the right side of the trail.
As I continue staring the dog down, I suddenly find myself flying through the air. Midair, I began piecing together what had happened — in my attempt to spare the dog, I had drifted too far to the right of the trail and my right foot had smashed itself into a large rock with enough force to flip me over the bars of my bike and dump me onto the ground.
As I lie on my back, the middle-aged woman throws her hands over her mouth in shock and repeatedly asks me if I am alright. Her husband curses and chases the dog trying to get it back on its leash, while the little bastard prances around, gloatingly.
“Bells they chime, damn they fine; getting into Lowell gonna blow your mind,” the dog seems to whisper, trouncing around my twisted heap of limbs and bicycle with unconcealed glee. Oh shut up.
But in that moment, lying on my back, as the adrenaline wears off and I feel searing pain spread into my right foot, left knee, left hip, elbows, and shins, I have a moment of clarity: “Wow, this hurts way fucking worse than getting quadded.”
As I begin to stand up, I start to laugh. It’s not even 10 a.m. I shouldn’t even be awake yet. Also, this is insane. I can’t believe this chain of events has aligned with such precision. Apparently, there is a god, and they have an amazing sense of comedic timing.
The pain and embarrassment really helps put things into perspective. Does the quad suck? Absolutely. Does the quad suck as much as peeling your sock off to see that your cracked toenail is oozing blood from the spot of impact, and then having to gingerly put that sock back on and bike two miles home? Absolutely not.
I can’t wait for a year from now when I get to be the one quadding freshmen. I will burst into a room of previously excited freshman boys yelling, “Semper Cor, suckers!” and they will promptly burst into tears. I will paternally gather them in a circle, put my hand on their shoulders, and whisper in their ears the graphic story of what happened to my foot. I will then say to them: “Listen, kids, when I was your age, I thought being quadded would be a truly painful experience too –– now, I think it’s all relative.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School students have rallied to create several initiatives — including a COVID-19 Task Force — in an effort to provide assistance and solutions for the hospitals, businesses, and workers who have encountered difficulties due to pandemic-induced complications.
The COVID-19 Task Force, led by two MBA students, Amina Edwards and Sarika Mendu, is split into two main branches: MBAs Fight COVID-19 and The MBA 1200. MBAs Fight COVID-19 has partnered with the Boston technology company Catalant, and attempts to match struggling organizations and businesses with MBA students who can offer their skills and expertise.
“We’re really just looking for ways for MBAs to serve,” Edwards said. “We’ve seen such an incredible outpouring of interest in service from the MBA community and we want to make sure that’s directed towards useful projects.”
According to Mendu, there are more than 350 MBA students signed up for MBAs Fight COVID-19. More than 150 of them are currently working on projects.
One such project is called the “City of Birmingham SBA Loan Filing,” where students assist those applying for small business loans in Birmingham, Ala. Students working on another project, dubbed “Project Meltblown,” research how to manufacture the Meltblown polypropylene material used in N95 masks domestically.
The MBA 1200, the other pillar of the HBS COVID-19 Task Force, is headed by MBA students Rebecca Milian and Carmi Medoff. This fundraising campaign encourages MBA students to donate a portion of their stimulus checks to relief funds, local residents, and businesses in need.
“When the CARES Act was introduced, Becca and I saw an opportunity to try to motivate our classmates with the stimulus checks coming in,” Medoff said.
Though the CARES Act provides $2 trillion for economic relief, The MBA 1200’s website said that speaking with small local businesses made it clear to the team that “donations are needed to support ongoing and future needs.”
Milian and Medoff designed the website so students can easily donate directly to The MBA 1200’s partner organizations or any other organization, increasing “speed and transparency,” according to Milian. Partner organizations include the Boston Impact Initiative-People Guarantee Pool, the Robin Hood Relief Fund, and Connections for the Homeless.
Besides the efforts coordinated by the HBS COVID-19 Task Force, there are several other independently-run initiatives to help those who are struggling during the pandemic.
MBA student Sophie Bai is focusing on raising money for personal protective equipment and facilitating large shipments of PPE supplies from China to Boston. Because she has friends who are doctors working in Boston hospitals, Bai said she knew just how drastically the “massive PPE shortage” was affecting healthcare workers each day.
“In order to be able to treat patients and be able to combat COVID-19 in an effective way, you have to have enough PPE,” Bai said.
Bai has direct access to supplies and an export infrastructure thanks to a family friend who works as an established medical equipment distributor, according to WGBH. Bai said in an interview with The Crimson that her team is taking a more “customized approach” by asking each hospital what they need directly and delivering those exact supplies.
Bai has collaborated with numerous people and organizations, including the Boston Foundation and Flywire, law firms, and Business School professor Jeffrey J. Bussgang ’91.
“It really is a community effort to pull this together in such a short period of time,” Bai said.
Bai said her team has raised over $3 million. Moreover, she said, the team has procured more than 1.5 million pieces of PPE — a third of which has already been delivered to hospitals in Boston.
In a collective effort to help workers during the pandemic, 1,000 MBA students also signed an open letter to the Fortune 500 CEOs that implores them to help and care for their employees, and provides guidance for those measures. The letter was written by Mendu and classmates Amy Villaseñor and Steve Moore, who said they were inspired by workers’ stories of “stress and insecurity.”
“You must set the tone for the corporate world’s collective response to COVID-19 by caring foremost for those closest to home – your employees,” the letter reads, adding that “it is the moral imperative in times of crisis.”
Mendu said she hopes this letter shows Fortune 500 CEOs that this generation of students “is watching and will remember the actions that employers are taking right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As graduate students approach the end of their programs at Harvard, many students have expressed uncertainty about their post-graduation employment prospects due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
In response to the COVID-19 public health crisis, Harvard has altered traditional aspects of the graduate student experience by moving classes online and canceling the public dissertation defense requirement in some departments.
Looking ahead at life after graduation, some graduate students said they were concerned about the scarcity of employment opportunities given that universities across the country — including Harvard — have implemented hiring freezes in light of the pandemic.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an email that GSAS has reached out to alumni to help identify jobs for graduating students, and is working with the Office of Career Services to facilitate professional connections.
Still, Jessica A. Bardsley, a Ph.D. candidate in Film and Visual Studies, said the coronavirus outbreak has exacerbated an already-competitive market for postdoctoral jobs.
“There’s already not very much out there,” Bardsley said. “What I witnessed as everything with COVID-19 came to pass is that a lot of schools that hadn’t already found people to fill certain postdocs and visiting positions, a lot of those positions actually just disappeared.”
Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that FAS froze some visiting faculty searches, but kept others “based on curricular need.”
Other students also expressed worry regarding the pattern of hiring freezes. Ph.D. candidate in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Blake V. Dickson said if he does not find a job, he will likely move back to Australia because his Harvard health insurance plan ends on July 31. Without a job, he will be left without coverage.
“The only option that I have is getting a job right now,” Dickson said. “If I don’t do that, it’s stressful to think about because I would have to then uproot my entire life to a different country again.”
As a result of the limited job market, students are evaluating other options, including delaying their graduation. Bardsley said she had planned to graduate this year, but in light of the pandemic, she decided to continue her studies at Harvard for another year.
Ph.D. candidate in Philosophy David A. Thorstad said spending additional time in graduate school could impact a student’s future employment prospects.
“If you have to spend not only one more year in graduate school as a consequence — but maybe two or three if this trickles down to the job market next year — this can be career-ending,” Thorstad said.
As the public health crisis persists, students have called on their institutions to provide them with financial assistance, according to Bardsley. Harvard’s graduate student union has been advocating for the University to provide Ph.D. students with a fully-funded “COVID-19 bridge year” to subsidize their research efforts that were disrupted by the outbreak.
“I think that’s what a lot of [Harvard] graduate students in this position are pressing for. For the University to step up,” Bardsley said.
Hall wrote that GSAS had first focused on graduate students’ “immediate safety needs” and is currently working with the University to “evaluate the categories of need” students have.
“Since the Coronavirus Disease pandemic began, GSAS has focused on helping our students during this crisis,” Hall wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the face of a financial crisis, Harvard Athletics has deferred all capital projects and is considering other cost-cutting moves, Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise said in an interview last week.
The department has halted refurbishing some of its facilities following the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s announcement that it would postpone all capital projects indefinitely. FAS — the division of the University that oversees the College and thus Harvard Athletics — has already incurred nearly $30 million in unforeseen expenses and lost revenue as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Those losses place FAS in a deficit for FY 2020.
Projects at the top of the department’s agenda had included improvements to the wrestling team’s facilities housed in the Malkin Athletic Center, the Weld and Newell boathouses used by Harvard’s men and women’s crew teams, and the sailing center, which sank into the Charles River more than two years ago.
“It’s unrealistic to think that we’re going to be able to operate the way we did in the past,” Scalise said.
“People will be creative, and we’ll try to minimize the negative impact but there will be some things that have to change, just to be realistic and to be responsible,” he added.
During the 2018-2019 academic year, Harvard Athletics operated a budget of nearly $30 million, according to the Equity in Athletics Data Analysis compiled by the United States Department of Education.
Harvard boasts the most varsity athletics programs — 42 — out of the nearly 350 colleges and universities that comprise the National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I. Nearly 1,200 Harvard College students play on a varsity team, according to a Harvard Athletics website.
Though the extent of the cuts remains unclear, Scalise said the department will draw on its experience from the previous recession, when it trimmed its budget by 15 percent.
During the previous financial crisis, Scalise explained, the department tried to limit its cuts to areas that would not affect student-athletes. Faced with a similar situation roughly ten years later, Scalise said he is not sure the department can afford to shield its varsity programs entirely.
“Having done that not too long ago, I don’t know whether we’ll be able to do that at this point in time,” he said. “We’re down people from where we were back in 2008 on the administrative side, so we may have to get more into the programmatic elements of it. Hopefully not, but we may have to.”
Anticipating drops in donations, Scalise said teams may have to limit their travel. While the department subsidizes travel costs for regional competition, donors finance teams’ travel nationally and internationally.
Though a handful of athletics directors and head coaches at top athletics universities in the country have already taken pay cuts — some of which have been voluntary — Scalise said his department has not yet reduced the salaries of its staff.
Unlike many other Division I programs, Scalise said Harvard does not pay its coaches based on how much revenue their sport brings in for the University. During the 2018-2019 academic year, the department paid all of its coaches a combined $8,702,392, according to the Department of Education’s website.
As Athletics navigates the unfolding public health crisis and its impact on the upcoming athletics seasons, a new leader will have to parse those thorny financial problems; Scalise will retire in June after serving as the head of Harvard Athletics for 19 years, though he will continue in an advisory role. FAS Dean Claudine Gay is slated to select Harvard’s next Director of Athletics in the coming month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Councilor Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 submitted a policy order Saturday to aid local restaurants relying on food delivery apps to support their operations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered Massachusetts restaurants to stop dine-in services in mid-March in an effort to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus. Since then, restaurants have relied on take-out and delivery services to remain afloat, largely leaning on business obtained through third-party delivery apps like UberEats and Grubhub.
According to the policy order, those delivery apps charge restaurants commission fees as large as 30 percent and offer restaurant owners “very little bargaining power.”
“Restricting restaurants to takeout and delivery has placed a sudden and severe financial strain on small businesses that already operate on thin margins,” the policy order reads.
“Restaurants already struggling have experienced an increase in orders through delivery apps from a low percent of total sales (5%-20%) to as much as 80% of total sales, which leads to an inability to cover costs and multi-billion companies getting excess fees from small local businesses,” it continues.
The policy order requests that Cambridge’s City Manager research the feasibility of capping delivery app fees at 10 percent per order. If passed during Monday’s City Council meeting, it would also require delivery services to disclose how revenues from purchases are allocated between restaurants and the third-party services.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said statewide restrictions have brought unprecedented hardship upon Square business owners.
“To the businesses here in Harvard Square and particularly the restaurants, I cannot imagine a more challenging time for them,” she said.
One such business owner — Nhon Ma, co-owner of Zinneken’s Waffles — said the pandemic has greatly reduced Square restaurants’ revenues and forced his business to rely almost solely on third-party delivery services.
“Some restaurants are basically operating at a loss,” he said. “They’re not generating a profit, so they’re working for free.”
“We used to work with delivery companies in the past, but now… it’s about like 90 percent of our revenue are going through them,” he added.
Ma said he thinks Nolan’s order is a good decision, but is concerned such a measure could put Cambridge at a disadvantage if neighboring cities do not adopt similar measures.
“On one hand I think that’s a good decision because, as I’ve said before, I mean we rely mostly on the services,” he said.
On the other hand, Ma said he fears the measure will cause the delivery companies to prioritize working with restaurants “where they can achieve larger profits in each transaction.”
Kari Kuelzer, the owner of Grendel’s Den, said the proposal will not be particularly helpful for her restaurant, which she described as a “dine-in drinking establishment.”
“Our product is not just the food that’s on the plate, it’s the experience of being in the place,” Kuelzer said.
Third-party deliveries are “important to restaurants,” she added. “But in the big picture, it’s just one of the many things that have been problematic for a long time.”
The policy order’s restrictions on delivery fees would last through the duration of Baker’s stay-at-home order, or until restaurants are allowed to serve customers dining in their establishments at “full capacity.”
Nolan said she sees her order as a chance to protect an integral part of Cambridge’s neighborhoods.
“This is an opportunity for us to think about ways that we can support these small, local entrepreneurs, many of whom are the heart and soul of our neighborhoods,” Nolan said.

Young Americans broadly disapprove of President Donald Trump and say they will favor his likely opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the 2020 presidential election, according to the spring 2020 iteration of the Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll.
The biannual Youth Poll conducts national surveys of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 on various current events and issues; it is conducted by undergraduates in the IOP’s Harvard Public Opinion Project under the supervision of IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe. The spring 2020 poll results were released Thursday.
The poll, which surveyed more than 2,500 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29, found that Biden leads Trump 51 percent to 28 percent among all of its respondents — and his lead is even wider among respondents who said they are “likely voters.”
Just 32 percent of those surveyed said they approve of Trump’s job performance.
The survey found that Biden’s lead over Trump among surveyed youths is similar to that which U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary earlier this month, would have held in a hypothetical general election matchup.
On a press call Thursday, Della Volpe said that one of the key questions of the poll was “What would the Bernie factor be heading into the general election?”
“We found, actually, that the Bernie factor isn’t really a factor,” he said.
Fifty-four percent of respondents said they will “definitely” vote in the upcoming presidential election. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed Democrats and 64 percent of surveyed Republicans said they will “definitely” vote in November; only 31 percent of surveyed independent and unaffiliated voters said they would turn out.
Just 8 percent of respondents said they believed the government is “working as it should be.”
“We actually found the overall sentiment unsurprising given our personal experiences interacting with our friends and classmates,” Justin Y. Tseng ’22, a member of the Public Opinion Project, said. “I think there’s a general anxiety that government isn’t addressing our problems, such as our worries when it comes to healthcare and debt.”
The coronavirus pandemic and healthcare were rated as the two most important issues among respondents. Forty-five percent of respondents said they are concerned about access to healthcare and mental health services, and 43 percent said they are concerned that someone they know will die from COVID-19.
Concern over healthcare has increased twofold, from 8 percent to 17 percent, since the IOP’s fall 2019 youth poll.
“Our sense is that concern over healthcare has really been there all along, but coronavirus has really laid bare the inequities and problems in access to the healthcare system in such a way that it’s really made it salient to the minds of young voters,” IOP Public Opinion Project Chair K. “Cathy” Sun ’22 said. “I think the ongoing pandemic will really only exacerbate a lot of these problems that young people are already experiencing — particularly more young people of color.”
The Youth Poll also examined the varying degrees to which black and white Americans trust public institutions and found the greatest disparity within trust in the police. The survey found that 28 percent of black respondents said they trusted the police, compared to 59 percent of white respondents. It also found that white respondents were largely more trustful of public institutions to “do the right thing all or most of the time.”
Eighty-five percent of respondents agreed that the government needs to take some measures to alleviate student loan debt. Sixty-three percent of survey respondents expressed concern over the impact of housing costs on their future.
Della Volpe said although young people often expressed fear over matters such as healthcare and family stability at focus groups, he is “hopeful” there will be a large youth turnout in the 2020 election.
“Rather than turning away, I think they’re leaning in toward voting in the general election and giving some voice to those anxieties through the ballot box,” he said. “We saw that in ’18. I’m hopeful we’ll see that in this cycle as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students seek out remote work opportunities, Harvard College Dean of Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba says the College can press, but not force, campus employers to offer jobs to undergraduates.
Thimba wrote that the College has endeavored in recent weeks to create remote employment opportunities for students precluded from working their on-campus jobs due to the undergraduate evacuation.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke told undergraduates last month that those who cannot perform their former on-campus jobs remotely should seek other online employment opportunities through the Student Employment Office.
Some students said, however, they have struggled to secure remote employment, finding few available opportunities on the SEO site. Others questioned why the College could not continue to pay undergraduates their weekly average if they cannot perform their term-time work remotely.
Responding to those concerns, Thimba wrote in an email that Harvard has seen additional job postings appear on the SEO database after encouraging departments that previously didn’t hire student employees to post new positions.
“We have also heard about positions that are available but were not posted on the SEO site, and hope that we can see more employers use the site,” she wrote.
She also explained that the College could not commit to paying students because they are employed by 170 departments across the University.
“Each campus employer has a budget for student employees that is not funded by the College and they made independent determinations about whether they had suitable work to continue to employ students,” she wrote.
Still, Thimba wrote that she was “gratified” the Faculty of Arts and Sciences chose to remove the term-time work expectation for students receiving financial aid and increased their scholarships by $875 to address their income continuity needs.
“But I’m aware that students may still need to work and will continue to encourage campus employers to think about employing students,” she added.
Many students planning to participate in Harvard summer programs will still be able to continue their internships remotely and receive a stipend, Thimba added.
“For those who can’t, and for those who need to work in addition to earning a stipend, I do hope that they’ll be summer jobs they can apply to,” she wrote.
The Wiener Center for Social Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School was one among several campus employers creating new remote work opportunities for students.
Faculty director David J. Deming said the Wiener Center has recently subsidized faculty to hire 18 new student research assistants. He said the center will support 80 hours of work for each position, with the hope that the faculty will maintain the students for the summer and perhaps even next fall.
Deming said the center created the positions to “step into the void” created by the campus closure last month.
“We thought, why not try to stand this up rapidly and see if we can make a difference?” he said.
Deming said he partnered with Daniel M. “Dan” Lobo ’14 — assistant director of career services and president of the Harvard First Generation Alumni — among others, to advertise the new job opportunities to first generation, low income students. He also considered whether students had lost their former on-campus employment due to coronavirus when making hiring decisions.
Deming added that the center hoped to “seed some activity” at a time when it is difficult for faculty and on-campus employers to come up with funds.
“It’s like a startup accelerator, except for RA positions,” he said. “If we give it a little bit of a boost, then faculty are going to find, and students are going to find, great connections and great projects and get to know each other.”
“This is a time when everybody who’s got a little bit of capability to do something like this ought to step up,” Deming added. “I would love it if other centers and other faculty get inspired to help too.”

While COVID-19 cases surge at short-staffed hospitals across the Greater Boston area, routine visits to smaller Cambridge medical practices have declined, leading to reductions in staff and operations.
An early April report released by the American Academy of Family Physicians estimated that nearly 60,000 family practices across the country will either significantly scale back or close operations entirely by June. Under this projection, nearly 800,000 employees — 43 percent of all family medicine workers — would be furloughed, laid off, or suffer reduced hours and wages.
Norma Finkelstein — founder of the Cambridge-based Institute for Health and Recovery, which runs mental health and substance abuse disorder programs across the state — said she has had to lay off and furlough some staff.
Finkelstein said many IHR programs cannot be delivered in their usual capacity over Zoom, though the institute has attempted to make the virtual transition.
“We’ve adapted like everybody else — suddenly we’re in a whole new world. And it’s exhausting,” Finkelstein said. “It’s hard to make a relationship with a new client over Zoom.”
She said reaching out to youth populations has been especially challenging since most IHR youth programming was delivered in schools, which have shuttered across Massachusetts.
Partners Urgent Care, meanwhile, has closed three of its locations, including its Central Square office. One center in Natick, Mass. has temporarily transformed into a respiratory evaluation clinic.
Other doctor’s offices, however, have not experienced the same losses. Sarah A. McLain, senior operations manager at CareWell Urgent Care — which has two Cambridge branches — said that staff have taken time off and reduced hours instead.
“We have not had to lay off or furlough anyone,” she said. “We have had some people that decided to take some time off. And that was — we certainly told them that we will 100 percent hold their job when they’re ready to come back and, you know, when they’re comfortable.”
Moreover, CareWell centers have implemented new measures such as telehealth phone registration questionnaires. They’ve also begun offering some remote services, such as treatment from patients’ cars.
Many urgent cares are working in conjunction with Boston healthcare providers such as Cambridge Health Alliance. McLain said CareWell is affiliated with the University of Massachusetts and is finding ways to take advantage of the partnership.
IHR previously partnered with Cambridge Health Alliance to run an opioid prevention and intervention program for older women — but Finkelstein said these programs have been canceled, too.
“We did our work in senior centers,” she said. “And all of that stopped by mid-March, especially since we were working with a very vulnerable population.”
IHR has since received an emergency relief loan through the Small Business Administration, according to Finkelstein.
McLain said she believes urgent care centers could be at the forefront of combatting the pandemic, and that she hoped at the beginning of the crisis that they would be better utilized by the government. She added that CareWell urgent care centers have begun rolling out antibody testing for COVID-19 immunity.
“We are here — all of us, all urgent cares. We’re trying to do our best to be here for the patients. We’re still open. We’re still serving the communities and, you know, if anybody’s paying attention, we want to help the government,” she said.
“We want to help the hospitals. And we can. They just need to tell us how,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some senior concentrators in Harvard’s Department of Theater, Dance, and Media say they are concerned about their portfolios and post-graduation plans in light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
These seniors said they have faced increased interruptions in completing their thesis projects after leaving campus during the College’s transition to online instruction for the remainder of the semester.
Avila S. Reynolds ’20, a TDM concentrator, began the planning of her thesis film, entitled “The Pursuit of Happiness,” early on in her college career.
“My senior thesis is the first film thesis for the department, a proposal I’ve been negotiating with TDM since my sophomore year to have approved,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds, who said her thesis film is “currently on hold due to the coronavirus,” said the department approved an alternate assignment to replace the creative portion of her thesis. Still, she said she is concerned about the professional and financial impacts of graduating without a completed thesis film.
“My thesis film, which I’ve been working on now for over a year, was meant to be the centerpiece of my portfolio,” she said. “Without Harvard’s resources, including their film equipment, permits for locations, studio rehearsal spaces, et cetera, I have no idea how I will foot this financially.”
“Ironically I do have the time to make it, as I am currently unemployed for the summer and this coming fall,” Reynolds added.
Gregory E. Lipson ’20, another TDM concentrator, echoed Reynolds’s concerns and pointed to a lack of post-graduation theater opportunities due to the pandemic.
“Every single summer theater program I applied to for after graduation has now been cancelled or postponed, including the offer I had accepted,” Lipson said. “I've been considering finding jobs in other fields that can be completed remotely.”
Marvin Merritt IV ’20, a TDM concentrator, began working on his thesis as a junior and planned to stage a live show about Deer Isle, Maine, where he grew up.
Merritt said that, after students were asked to vacate campus, the department initially allowed him to revise the structure of his thesis project while trying to retain its “liveness.”
“I basically restructured my piece to kind of basically be a one-person show for a one-person audience, and that audience was basically the camera,” he said. “So, whoever ended up viewing this video would feel as if they were the one there, because I needed the piece to still kind of deal with liveness, which really is the quality which separates theater from film.”
However, Merritt said his thesis ultimately had to be submitted as a script when his filming was interrupted by a stay-at-home order issued in Maine.
“It’s definitely a little heartbreaking to invest this much time and energy into a piece which won't actually be able to be shared, at least at this time,” he said.
Merritt said that, like Reynolds and Lipson, he is “deeply concerned” about his career prospects. Still, he said he remains committed to pursuing a career as an artist.
“I really do care about the work that I’m producing and I’m willing to tough it out if that means I’m going to be able to do it in the future,” Merritt said. “But it’s definitely hard.”

Vistas is usually a great time to become acquainted with the acronyms and names that make Harvard what it is, so why should Virtual Visitas be any different? If you’ve been confused about what the Q Guide is or what a Proctor does (and haven’t wanted to ask in the Groupme), read this guide to discover Harvard specific vocab to throw in during Zooms.
Residential Life
The River / The Quad / The Yard
The Yard is home to most of the freshman dorms. Most upperclassmen live in either one of the nine River houses or the three Quad houses, which Quadlings will tell you is not that far away.
Pfoho /foh-hoe/
Shorthand for Pforzheimer House, one of the Quad houses and home to the Igloo (see below).
Berg /berg/
Known as Berg for when you’re too lazy to say three syllables (Annenberg), the first-year dining hall (or d-hall) will be your heaven during brunch and your hell when you’re trying to finish an assignment during Brain Break, a snack break hosted every night by the lovely dining staff.
Flyby vs FlyBy
Flyby is one of the most honorable, charming, cherished, and did we mention, hilarious publications on campus, which brings this article to you, as well as many more here. When they’re on the go, upperclassmen have the option to eat at FlyBy, located under Berg, when they’re unable to make it to their Houses to grab a bite.
Entryway
A tightly knit community of around 30 people living in the same dorm with the same proctor/tutor (see below), and where you’ll meet some of your first friends.
Proctor/Tutor
Your guardian-not-parent who is an amazing resource for any and all concerns, from residential life to navigating the social scene to balancing extracurriculars and academics. Not only does your proctor have a wealth of information, but they also have lots of snacks.
PAF /paff/
A Peer Advising Fellow, or an upperclassman who is there to give advice from a student’s perspective. Every freshman is assigned a PAF who is also part of the entryway community. Plus, they’ll take you out to coffee and throw study breaks with free food. (If you can’t tell, Harvard students are primarily motivated by – you guessed it: free food)
Academics
Concentration, secondary, citation
Concentration and secondary are the Harvard vernacular for “major” and “minor.” You can earn a foreign language citation by taking four courses of a language beyond an introductory level.
Shopping Week
The most chaotic week of the semester. During this time students sample or “shop” classes they are interested in taking. Don’t worry if you still have four extra courses by the end of shopping week – we’ve all been there before, and that is exactly what the Q guide is for.
Q guide /cue-guyd/ 
If shopping week is a treacherous mountain terrain, the Q guide is the map with all of the safety hazards written on it. The Q guide is a compilation of the rankings for each course on a 5-point scale (1-worst, 5-best) and advice from students who have taken the course before. This is a great way to find gems – a class with a high rating and little work.
TF /tee-eff/
Teaching fellow. Typically a graduate student that helps out with the course and will lead smaller discussion sections outside of lecture. The Harvard word for TA.
Pset / MQC / OH
Psets, or problem sets are a collection of questions assigned most commonly by STEM classes. Luckily, Harvard provides great resources when you just can’t get a problem or have questions about a topic. The Math Question Center (MQC) along with office hours (OH), which are available in every course (even the humanities!), are frequently packed with students seeking help.
PSL / CA
Peer Study Leaders and Course Assistants are undergrads who have previously done well in the course and help current students with the course assignments in office hours.
The Writing Center and The Writing Program
At some point, your Expository 20 (Expos) requirements will take you to one or both of these locations. The Writing Center, staffed with trained undergraduate tutors, is located in the Barker Center and is a great way to get extra help on your essays. Make sure to schedule in advance. The Writing Program, at One Bow Street, is where the Expos preceptor’s offices are located and where their OHs will typically be held.
Libraries
Every Harvard student’s second home; a perfect place for hardcore grinding or “studying” with friends. Each library has their own vibe, so here is some key info:
Cabot vs Cabot
Cabot Science Library is a collaborative library in the Science Center; Cabot House is an upperclassman house in the Quad. So if your friend texts you to come to Cabot Library, don’t take the Quad shuttle to get there.
Lam Caf, Lamonster
Lamont Cafe, affectionately known as Lam Caf, is open until 2 A.M. in the 24/7 Lamont Library and will be the home of many late night study sessions. Students who carry a toothbrush around Lamont with them and only venture out to get food are less affectionately known as Lamonsters.
Extracurriculars / For Fun
Comp
Comping is the process of joining a club. Some clubs are “competition” based which includes applications and/or interviews, while others are “completion” based that focus on you completing tasks over a given period, anod some clubs have no comp process at all! Each club is different and all are worth checking out at the club fair.
The Aquarium
Located in Cabot (House), the Aquarium is a party space that you’ll probably frequent. And no, it does not have fish tanks.
The Igloo
Pfoho’s party space. Despite its incredibly misleading name, you’ll be lucky if you can get any ice when you’ve been sweating through your shirt for the past two hours.
Boardplus vs Crimson Cash
BoardPlus: $65 (for free!) that Harvard gives you every semester to spend at the Harvard-operated cafés and grilles. It rolls over into the next semester but not the next year, so make sure you spend it all before May. Or before you get kicked off campus because of coronavirus. Whatever works.
Crimson Cash: This is YOUR OWN MONEY. Crimson Cash is commonly used for laundry, printing, and coffee at Café Gato Rojo.
Bump
A passive aggressive way to say, “Respond to my email!!”. You’ll get this one about a thousand-and-one times when you’re here.
The T /thuh tee/
The Boston subway system; no one is trying to spill tea when they say this to you.
Quoffice /kwah-fiss/
Located in the Grays basement, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life is known among students as the “Quoffice”. Come here for support, resources, and conversations on queer and trans student life at Harvard!
Datamatch
Your only opportunity to find love. Ever.
Just kidding. Datamatch is “a free matchmaking service created for college students by college students to find true love.” Usually it means you take a quirky survey, and try to swindle as much free food as possible out of the Datamatch-partnered locations.
Yardfest
A school sponsored concert in April that Harvard throws in the Yard. There may be ex-Coachella performers, there may be an ungodly amount of mud, but there will definitely be fun.

It’s commonly heard among Harvard’s students that outside of the classroom activities and experiences truly make their time at Harvard unique. While that is mostly true, Flyby hopes to give you some tools for recreating Harvard classroom vibes from the comfort of your bedroom, backyard, or wherever you may be. So go grab your take on a Veritaffle from your kitchen-turned-Annenberg, and follow along these steps to transform a day in quarantine into an ~academic~ experience.
Join in on one of the classics, aka CS50. 
Still learning the Harvard acronyms? Don’t worry, we are too. If you want to get a taste of being a first year at the college, then you’ll definitely want to sit in on one of these “classic” courses. Can’t follow along? Don’t worry, most of us can’t either. Don’t want to follow on the conventional first-year path of EC10 and the like? Then sift through the course catalog offered on my.harvard and find your own assortment of classes that pique your “Intended Concentration: Undecided” curiosity.
Ted Talk it Out with a Professor. 
Want to attempt to wrap your head around some of the world’s most challenging problems or philosophical dilemmas? Ever wanted to be able to discuss some new scientific discovery at the dinner table with family? Then do a quick google search for “Harvard professors give Ted Talk” and let your mind grow in wisdom.
Read (Skim) Through a Book. 
Become a professional Harvard student and grab that “required” reading off the bookshelf and see how fast you could skim through only the assigned pages. We promise this will be a skill necessary for the years to come. No need to thank us yet. Maybe even open an image of the Loker Reading Room in Widener to feel like a real, studious Harvard student.
Virtual Tour of Academic Sites. 
Get excited for the beautiful buildings and classrooms in which you will begin your career as a Harvard student. Though we all find ourselves physically distant from school in quarantine, Harvard’s beautiful campus is only a click away on Google Images. We highly recommend you check out Sanders Theatre (for all those EC10 and CS50 learners), Widener Library (for those nights when you just can’t stand noise), and the Smith Center (for the best natural light on campus) for starters.
Ask Around!
Though my.harvard and Google searches are great places for finding the best professors and courses offered, we truly believe that the best resources are fellow Harvard students. Don’t hesitate to ask around for the best class recommendations or the hidden study spots on campus. We can’t wait to meet you soon!

Usually a weekend of chaos, excitement, and lanyards, Visitas is a Harvard staple, where all of the upperclassmen dedicate their entire weekends to creating a fun experience for prospective freshmen. While it’s certainly disappointing that Visitas has moved online, there are some silver linings that you can appreciate about not being on campus.
A bed.
Crammed next to three other strangers on a weird-smelling carpet on a common room floor? No thanks. When you’re streaming Visitas panels from your comfy bed, you might forget that Visitas lodging is mediocre at best, and it would otherwise leave you with a sore back and a million cramps.
Don’t get lost.
Know where the bathroom is? Your kitchen? Your bed? Yet another perk of Virtual Visitas! On campus, the mark of a prefrosh is a customary red Harvard lanyard and the signature lost-sheep look. Instead of wandering around for thirty minutes trying to find Sever Hall or begging some stressed upperclassmen to give you directions, enjoy already knowing the layout of your home. The only thing that will be confusing is which Zoom link corresponds to which event.
Zoom Omnivision
You may have just connected on a spiritual level with someone but you’ve already forgotten their name. Instead of the awkward “Hey… person” greetings you’ll have to deal with every day at Visitas, you’ll have a name to associate with every 1x1 face on Zoom. No more forgetting people’s names – at least, not until orientation.
The Ivy Trinity
After five minutes of talking to this kid, they’ve already told you that they’re “just having such a tough time” deciding between Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and a gap year of single-handedly fixing the world’s economy. Instead of muttering an “Oh cool…” and slowly slipping away, just pretend your Wi-Fi connection is blipping, your entire Zoom setup is crashing, your microphone isn’t working and – all of the sudden, Virtual Visitas isn’t looking too bad.
Rescind-itas
While sneaking into parties as a prefrosh is incredibly exhilarating, there are the risks that come with it: since Harvard’s amnesty policies don’t extend to prefrosh, illegal things done on campus can be punished through the legendary rescind-itas. However, since you’re not on campus, it’s easier to avoid the temptation – and avoid getting caught.
Visitas or not, get ready for some of the best four years of your life; whether Visitas is online or in person, you’re bound to have a great experience at Harvard no matter what!
