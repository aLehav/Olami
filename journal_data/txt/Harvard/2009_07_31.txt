PARIS, France – An exhibition of Alexander Calder’s work could only mean dangling bits of wire painted in primary colors, and about a hundred little kids blowing on the mobiles, I thought.  I was wrong.  Well, partially.
This summer’s exhibition “Alexander Calder: les années parisiennes: 1926-1933” at Paris’s modern art hub in the fourth arrondissement, the Centre Pompidou, definitely had tourists huffing and fanning the sculptor’s hanging masterpieces, but the exhibition was not at all limited in scope to Calder’s famous mobiles.  Instead, the eight main rooms of the show offer a very diverse and multi-media approach to Calder’s oeuvre that make the blockbuster Kandinsky exhibition on the other side of building look almost monotonous.  
A large number of original sketches, films, and paintings supplement the primary focus of the exhibition: Calder’s wire sculptures, described as “drawings in space.”  The industrial aesthetic of Calder’s visual gymnastics even seems unintentionally to compliment the exposed framework of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers’s architecture at the Centre Pompidou.
Calder’s sketches are simultaneously whimsical and technical.  In a study for his work Circus, Calder draws a playful trapeze contraption, with his personal notes on how to create it: “Place lead weight on aluminum shelf, pull white thread, releasing weight, pulling phantom up on black thread.”  Seeing the actual manifestation of Circus in the next room adds to the impact.  The installation is an amalgamation of miniature circus figures: a lion in a wire cage and its long-limbed trainer in the circus ring, dangling trapeze figures, horses, elephants, camels, and of course, clowns.
The curatorial work in the gallery with Calder’s portraits is striking.  Six busts in wire hang from the ceiling in front of a white wall.  Spotlights shine on these three-dimensional contour caricatures, casting shadows on the wall behind.  The shadows morph from profile to three-quarter to frontal views, as the wire busts rotate in space.  
The exhibition also offers examples of Calder’s paintings, spurred by his visit to Piet Mondrian’s studio in 1930.  The two artists must have had the primary color fixation in common: “Black and white are first – then – red is next – and then I get sort of vague.  It’s really just for differentiation, but I love red so much that I almost want to paint everything red,” Calder said.  The show concludes with several examples of Calder’s more famous balancing act sculptures.
“I think best in wire,” the artist once said. Thank you for abandoning paints and canvas, Mr. Calder.  You bring back the crafty, Lincoln-log stacking, mobile-blowing child in all of us.

GRANADA, Spain — No one should ever leave Andalucia without watching flamenco, the quintessential dance of southern Spain, at least once.  Admittedly, I had my doubts when I signed up for what appeared to be some kind of packaged “deal” (it included transportation to and from the performance, with a free drink thrown in). I was prepared for a cheesy evening, ready to encounter the clichéd España of American films and guidebooks. But, once I entered the darkened flamenco club and the guitarist struck the first note, I was completely entranced.
Three women, wearing long skirts of cascading ruffles and scarlet flowers in their black hair, sat in chairs in front of the guitarist, a flutist, and a singer.  Reflecting the highly improvisatory nature of this art form, the dancers and musicians each took turns initiating pieces. Each performer remained seated until the music motivated her to begin.  Once she took the stage, the others concentrated on her movements and kept time according to her lead, with a complex rhythmic pattern emerging from the clapping, finger snapping, and lighting quick clicking of their heels.  Interwoven through it all, the lone female singer called plaintively. 
Each artist alternated between relatively slow movements—centered on the dancer’s upper body, facial expressions, and graceful hand motions—and fierce, explosive sequences that involved extremely complicated footwork, chest slaps, and fiery heel strikes, As a performer whirled, she received shouts of encouragement—“olé!” and “huzzah!” from her fellow artists, especially when preparing for a particularly difficult and exhausting section of the piece.
It was only after the dancers had left the stage and the lights had gone up that I was able to appreciate how deeply flamenco sucks in the audience.  My pulse was racing and my throat was dry, almost as if I had been up there on the stage myself.

AHMEDABAD, India — Q: What edge do American students have over their counterparts in Indian schools?
The movement toward educational accountability in the Bush administration made one fact particularly evident—that American education is in a state of disarray. For several decades, the margin in test scores between American and international students has only widened, with the U.S. lagging far behind in math and science. Historically, such a commitment to these subjects dissipated quickly as the Cold War ended and a period of American economic prosperity resumed. Just as in previous times of politico-economic stability, schools took to once again championing the arts and humanities. One noteworthy example in this newfound Pax Americana: increased patronage of the liberal arts curriculum.
In the 1980s, psychologists like Howard Gardner proposed theories that later rationalized new methodologies in pedagogy, prioritizing the creativity of the American student over his or her ability to perform under pressure. With the theory of “multiple intelligences” firmly in place, parents willingly took to shuttling kids off to soccer games, painting lessons, summer camps, and dance recitals. In high school and college, these interests turned into extracurriculars, which de-emphasized textbook learning but worked to contribute to the student’s growth as an individual. It is perhaps a luxury of America’s economic position that parents can afford to take such risks with their children, drawing time away from chasing numeric success and instead encouraging creativity. In India, if a parent is to pay for his son’s college tuition, that child must choose a path that ensures a secure and set future—not “the arts” And there is little by way of encouraging participation in extracurriculars. Time is better spent in the classroom or preparing for tests.
The college admissions process in America, while vastly overcomplicated, contrasts starkly with the narrow, month-long window in India, the date from which HSC (the 12th standard Board examination) results are released and the day college classes begin. In a nearly meritocratic fashion, colleges still award seats based on HSC results alone. But, of course, no system is impervious, and wrinkles like reserved seats for scheduled castes (effectively quota-based affirmative action), connections, and under-the-table payments can compensate for inadequate scores (although most do not have access to such advantages). With similar dialogue on high-stakes testing in America, no one is blind to the challenges the system in India poses—especially considering the anxiety, pressure, and suicides associated with it.
Nevertheless, this system is incredibly effective for what it intends: producing some of the smartest and most hardworking students of any country in the world, many of whom later seek appointment at elite universities (including Harvard) in math and the sciences. But at its core, Indian education praises by-rote learning, conformity, and standardization. It is an assembly-line approach in an industrializing country to produce not only goods, but its human investments as well. The most popular fields are the pigeonhole ones—with outsourced jobs waiting at the end, positions lacking creativity and advancement but with set pay and an accompanying glass ceiling.
In a country with so much potential, the Indian educational system fails at creating and encouraging leaders, instead quashing the creativity our own system champions among its youth. Many Indian students are complacent working for American companies in outsourced IT jobs, although many are far smarter than their foreign employers. Whereas an average American student may never match up to his Indian counterpart on the basis of test scores or work ethic, political, economic, and, most importantly, pedagogical asymmetry almost guarantees that the latter will end up working for the former. This sad fact of globalization, perhaps rooted in the investment each country has made for its future, shortchanges India’s students today, and therefore fails to effectively inspire this nation’s youth into becoming its leaders of tomorrow.

SAN REMO, Italy — I don’t know if it’s because she once worked at Vogue, or if she simply possesses a Jewish-mother-knows-everything trait, but my mum always suggests the best places to shop. 20 years of experience have taught me to trust her advice, and so I confidently lead my dubious friend past the designer labels and expensive leather in San Remo, towards a little shop that seems to specialize in buckets and spades.
Straw carrier bags line the outdoor stalls, along with 10 Euro rucksacks emblazoned with Tinkerbelle and other Disney characters. Yet in the dingy back room, with space for the till and little else, stand two immaculately dressed Italian women laden with lavish shopping bags. My friend and I patiently peruse the straw baskets, waiting for the women to leave so that we may enter the room. 
Admission is eventually granted, and amid the hanging plastic carrier bags and dim lighting, the shop owner unhooks a large basket from the ceiling. She proceeds to reveal two Chanel clutches and a Hermes bag. San Remo buildings are simple in style, but something suggests that this shop is more than just an unpretentious guise. The owner pulls more and more high-end designer bags out of the cheaper merchandise, each item indistinguishable from genuine upmarket products. She claims that most of the bags are simply very good quality fakes, but admits that a couple may have “fallen off a truck” 
My friend and I do not buy, but we nevertheless leave smug with satisfaction. As we walk past the chic businessmen and their stylish wives, we bask in our new revelation, having solved the eternally perplexing question of why Italians are always so well dressed.

SEOUL, South Korea — Last week, my fellow intern and I attempted to treat our colleague to a nice meal—instead, he paid for our steak lunches.. It was a comical situation; in our effort to thank this man for setting up our internships, we ended up setting him back nearly $100. Not only that, we inadvertently slighted him by attempting to treat him in the first place. In Korean business culture, when an intern pays for a senior, more established employee’s meal, it becomes a loss of face for the latter. Our colleague’s gesture was a kindness, yes, but also a necessary product of Korea’s Confucian social mores that say older people have responsibility for—and power over—younger ones. 
There are definitely positives to being on the lower end of this age bias. I’ve only once paid for lunch at work (and that was when I went out with my young, hipster coworker), because I’m the youngest person in the company.  When a seat opens up during rush hour on the Seoul Metro, the older men in suits stand by, and I only have to fight with the other young women in the car for it. When I go out with my Korean friends, the older ones take the lead and organize things while the rest of us sit back and relax.
However, on a societal level, the age hierarchy infantilizes younger workers. They become unwilling to even consider challenging their elders. The consequences can be severe; as Malcolm Gladwell relates in Outliers, Korean Airlines had a terrible safety record in the early 1990s because co-pilots would not correct their pilots. Korea also loses a lot of potentially excellent, young leaders because of this cultural issue. They feel under-qualified not by their lack of clear reasoning but by their lack of gray hair. On the flip side, older leaders become complacent in their positions not because of their abilities, but because of their age. This doesn’t mean that all 20-somethings possess clear reasoning or that elder Korean leaders lack abilities, just that equating age and wisdom is a mistake.
One day, a Korean-American friend and I were sitting in a restaurant with a large group of people. It was getting late and everyone was becoming restless as they talked about going elsewhere. “Let’s go figure the check out,” I said. “No, wait for one of the guys to do it,” she said. I turned to the one sitting across from me. “No, not him, one of the oppas,” my friend said, referring to the Korean term for an older, male friend. I didn’t understand—in America breaking up the check for a large group is the worst job. It’s frustrating: When I want to help and have the ability, I'm disqualified by my youth, even if I’m only junior by a year or two. Don’t tell anyone at my office, but I’m starting to think these free lunches aren’t worth the price I have to pay.

HARTFORD, Conn. — Think of an intern in a think tank. He tries to think, but his mind goes blank.
I try to think at the Yankee Institute for Public Policy. Our mission is “to promote economic opportunity through lower taxes and new ideas for better government in Connecticut.” But new ideas are rare. And interns face more imminent dilemmas, like whether to put the air conditioner on “energy saver” or “fan only.”
New ideas are rare because other people have already had them. In the office hang copies of our studies, which include “A Connecticut Assessment of State Income Taxation: Fueling Government, Stalling the Economy”; “Fifteen Years of Folly: The Failures of Connecticut’s Income Tax”; and “Save Connecticut’s Financial Future: Eliminate the Income Tax.” I’d say we’ve covered the income tax.
Even if you pick an original topic—public financing of political campaigns, for example—there’s another problem: You have no data—data you can easily download, that is. If you want to compare the margins of victory among state legislative races, you have to type the results into a spreadsheet yourself. And if you want to know how much Connecticut’s congressional delegation spends on franked mail, you have to go to a library—and check out a book.
And after you think great thoughts, you still need to get noticed. Without famous professors to call or rich donors to beckon, you place all your chips on one thing: the mail. Thankfully, a few of your envelopes breathe fresh air. The media, like “The Hartford Courant” or WDRC, report your efforts; they’re amazed someone bothered to look that stuff up.
The think tank is the school of hard knocks. But we’re lucky to spend our summer in a staring contest with Google. At least I think so.
