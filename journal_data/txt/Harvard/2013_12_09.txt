After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The saga of President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and resigned Undergraduate Council President-Elect Sam B. Clark ’15 has been anything but straightforward—rather, it has been marked with twists and turns befitting any successful political mini-series. The rollercoaster ride that began with Clark and Mayopoulos declaring their candidacy as a mere “joke” ticket ended this Sunday evening, when Clark declined the position of President, leaving Mayopoulos to ascend to the seat in his place. Sietse Goffard ’15, our pre-election choice for vice-president, will accede to Mayopoulos’ planned post of Vice President.
 Mayopoulos changed his mind—after declaring along with Clark that he planned to abandon his post immediately after assuming it—and decided to take on a leadership position on the UC. He has stated a determination to respect the voice of the Harvard student body that propelled his ticket to victory. He also thinks that he can connect with those students more effectively than the UC has in the past, much as he and Clark did throughout their campaign. We agree.
 Clark and Mayopoulos succeeded where other joke tickets in recent history have failed for a reason. Their policy planks, designed as comically minute considerations, actually affect the student experience more than the ambitious but sometimes vague platforms of their opponents. What’s more, Clark and Mayopoulos established a valuable connection with students on the campaign trail, employing a humorous attitude in lieu of the well-polished, pseudo-political façade typical of UC candidates. Clark and Mayopoulos would not have won the election had students not seen something promising in them, and we look forward to seeing Mayopoulos turn that promise into practice.
 As we opined after Clark and Mayopoulos’ election, the winning ticket did well to concoct a straightforward, relatable platform. Soup-and-butter issues like those on which they focused are concrete and easily achievable. While grander endeavors like reforming Harvard’s mental health system are surely important, the UC has for years not been able to deliver such large-scale change. The UC has also yet to achieve significantly improved communication between the Council and the students, while Mayopoulos has already proven himself capable of just that.
 
Students did not feel drawn to UC outsiders like Clark and Mayopoulos simply because they were funny. Students felt drawn to them because they also felt alienated from the insider tickets and the UC as a whole. If Mayopoulos is seriously committed to mending a hole that has long gone unpatched, we stand behind him.
 
We also look forward to the soup.

Thanksgiving break is such a tease. Family, “It’s a Wonderful Life,” and the annual decorations of Christmas trees provide a taste of the stress-free holiday environment awaiting those who make it through finals period. But the halcyon time mere weeks away can feel unreachable with the endless amount of papers, final projects, and exams one must first overcome. Unfortunately, in a fit of hypersensitive political correctness, Harvard seems to downplay the joys of the holiday season, creating an even more unwelcoming environment when compared to the familiar confines of the home. It is thus incumbent upon students to create their own happiness in this naturally dreary time.
Luckily, there are ways to make this happen. Netflix wonderfully provides subscribers with a seasonal slate of Christmas films, an offering that can be distracting during finals period but that can provide helpful pick-me-ups to those who need a break. Spotify and Pandora offer endless supplies of holiday music to accompany hard work, and those brave enough to pierce the “Harvard bubble” can take advantage of opportunities such as going ice skating and seeing a performance of the Nutcracker. Of course, time is a scarce resource for some in the early days of December, and even the busiest students deserve holiday cheer. Fortunately, such an outlet exists—that outlet is the Christmas dog.
Yesterday afternoon, my roommates and I were watching football when we realized our house’s (we live off-campus) distinct lack of Christmas spirit when compared with the cheerful abodes to which we returned for Thanksgiving. After a few minutes of discussion, we resolved to get a Christmas tree. Even my Jewish roommate agreed that—with Hanukkah in the rearview mirror—a tree was necessary to provide a festive atmosphere for our living environment. We proceeded to deliberate on whether our tree should be real or fake, settled on fake for obvious reasons, and then determined to make our way to Target after the Patriots game came to an—ultimately stunning—conclusion.
As soon as we hopped into the car, we decided we weren’t up to trekking all the way to the Target in Somerville—the place which a quick Google search suggested as our best option—so we headed to the Michaels in Porter Square to test our luck. While our immediate reaction was joyous as to the selection of Christmas trees, we discovered that they did not actually have in stock every shrub on display. We weighed compromising our firm belief that the four-and-a-half foot beauty would have worked perfectly in our living room, but ultimately could not overcome the altogether lackluster quality of the remaining options (which included a seven-foot monstrosity with scarcely more robustness or faux needles than a standard-grade coat hanger). We hung our heads in disappointment, certain we had failed our mission and let down our friends who had remained back at the house.
 And then we found it—the perfect ornamentation for a living room shared by seven college-aged men. Nestled in a surprisingly prominent location between the array of Christmas trees and those tacky light-up reindeer found on suburban lawns was the solution to our holiday grumpiness. It was indeed the “Christmas dog,” a decoration so perfect for our needs that it prompted my roommate to gleefully express, like a four-year-old amazed with the largesse of Santa Claus, “It’s a Christmas miracle.” Knowing that our friends would ultimately support the game-time decision, we purchased the object—of which Michaels was not even close to being sold out—and returned home.
The reactions of the other inhabitants of our Cantabrigian abode conveyed reactions similar to those of my purchasing partner. In a time of stress, despair, and occasionally desperation, the Christmas dog—which we decided to name Taco for obvious reasons—reminded us of the Christmas spirit and the joy the holiday season has to offer in the face of typical Harvardian obstacles. While our mission took admittedly crucial time out of our work schedule, I know that the utility gained far exceeded that possible in any given 45 minutes of studying. Additionally, we secured the added benefit of having Taco in our lives to cheer us up whenever we enter the living room throughout the rest of the semester (and, who knows, possibly semesters to come). While I can honestly say that my family would never think to buy something like the Christmas dog (there was a reason there were so many of them in stock), adding a Christmas decoration to the living situation reminded us of the holiday atmosphere by which we had been so comforted during the Thanksgiving break.
 
So, I implore you, spice up your life and take advantage of the holiday options in Michaels, Target, and other such stores. It’s the holiday season and the proximity of your exams should not force you to forget that. Maybe you too can rejoice in the festiveness of the Christmas dog, or maybe you’ll set out to buy one only to discover an alternative “Christmas miracle.” You never know until you take those 45 minutes and explore the world around you, a worthwhile endeavor guaranteed to improve the quality of living these next few weeks.

Dear freshmen,
 Finals week is finally before us. You may be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of conflicting advice bombarding you from people who are trying to be helpful. “Don’t panic,” they say. “Now might be a good time to freak out,” they later claim, when you wake up a mere 20 minutes after the start of your statistics exam. I myself distinctly remember asking two professors for finals advice my freshman year. “The right person to talk to is your TF,” the first one cheerfully told me. “Please stop talking,” the other suggested.
You have also likely seen countless Buzzfeed “articles” explaining how finals week works or some of the other dozens of pieces saying equally little with fewer pictures but potentially more hyperlinks. Ignore all of the finals advice published online. It is thoroughly useless and will not help you. Instead, this article will give you real advice that will help you get through finals week. Read it in its entirety.
In preparation for finals week, you should first learn the hours of Dunkin’ Donuts. Starbucks is for hipsters, who sip double-whipped peppermint mocha frappalattes and write “underappreciated works of contemporary societal analysis.” Starbucks is not for students who don’t know which line is the supply curve. And Starbucks is certainly not for those of us who are desperately trying to figure out how to spell Newey-West heteroskedasticity, much less understand which ordinal direction Newey refers to or its relation to library shelving systems. So go to Dunkin’, which, unfortunately, closes at midnight. 
Luckily, though, Lamont is open 24/7 during finals week, and it functions as a well-furnished homeless shelter for unfortunate souls sexiled by their goddamned roommates who don’t give a rat’s behind about finals because, well, because they’re morons, or else really smart people with healthy life perspectives. Some people even voluntarily seek out Lamont for a good night’s sleep. Freshmen, particularly those not living in Apley Court, take note—the armchairs in Lamont have more springs than your mattresses and a higher thread count than your sheets. Even more conveniently, Lamont is located in the Yard right by Mass. Ave, for those who have never stumbled upon it on a hazy weekend night. 
Speaking of weekend nights, many a young freshman has been caught off guard by the plethora of student drinking that takes place around finals time. Contrary to popular belief, upperclassmen are not drinking away the pain of their below-average B-pluses. Nor are they pre-gaming finals. They are actually preparing for Yardfest. The student body, you see, undergoes months of preparation in order to ensure that Yardfest is more tolerable, and has greater attendance, than an Occupy Harvard protest. Ever heard of Tyga? Didn’t think so. 
For the more sober-minded among us, another winning strategy involves purposely failing the final exam. As long as everyone in the class agrees to do so, the professor has no choice but to adjust the curve accordingly. And the most common grade is supposed to be an A, right? This collective test-failing strategy works particularly well for those taking Econometrics and Constitutional Law. I say this not because I am taking these classes, but rather because I am trying to selflessly impart the most important strategies to those who have yet to experience finals here at Harvard. 
But if you do choose to study, remember that Netflix is not your best friend—HBO GO is. And Harvard, in its beneficence, has extended to you free access to this marvelous service. (We also have subscriptions to a service called Philo, formerly Tivli, which, as far as I can tell, is the name of a Teletubbies spinoff.) Spend the two days preceding every exam watching “Boardwalk Empire,” decompressing, and relaxing before the big day. This, too, applies most specifically to those in Econometrics and Con Law. For those worried that HBO GO will drain too much time and productivity, fret not! Harvard has thought of this as well and discontinues the service during school breaks. 
 Inevitably, though, despite all of this excellent advice and an immense amount of preparation, you will likely walk into an exam and have absolutely no idea how to open that damned bottle of 5-Hour Energy. It says twist the cap, but isn’t that the same thing as twisting the bottle and holding the cap in place? I mean, is there even liquid inside the bottle? Maybe Schrodinger’s cat is hiding in there. And maybe not. But you’ve definitely studied too much for your philosophy final, which wouldn’t exactly be a problem except this is econometrics, and you still don’t know what heteroskedasticity is.
 Time to pre-game Yardfest.

If sex sells, then grade inflation is the new hookup culture—something that’s a hot topic yet not so much different than it was in the past. With clever phrasing, it makes headlines. The Tuesday announcement that the median grade at Harvard is an A- and the most commonly awarded grade is an A was met with a flurry of support, antagonism, and apathy.
Now, I’m an open critic of grade inflation, but I feel that the recent reports are intuitively deceptive and have elicited a response far beyond the appropriate amount. So I’d like to dispel a few unnecessary reactions that are floating around, and I’d like to do so by running through some statistics.
First, let’s clarify what it means for the most common grade to be an A. It does not mean that most Harvard students mostly receive A’s, that the average grade is an A, or even that the majority of grades are A’s. It means that the most frequent grade, compared to all others, is A. A thought experiment: A class has 100 students, where ten students get A’s, nine get A-minuses, nine get B-pluses, nine get B’s, and so on through D-minuses. Although 90 of the 100 students do not get A’s, the most frequently awarded grade is still an A. The pervasiveness of this mark, which represents 10 percent of the given grades, is much different from the idea that more than 50 percent of grades are A’s.
Now, the distribution of grades at Harvard is not as uniform as in the above example, so we turn to the median to try to make sense of Harvard’s grade distribution. It’s important to stress that saying the median grade at Harvard is an A- (or 3.67 on the GPA scale) is completely different from saying the average grade, and therefore average GPA, is a 3.67.
The median just says that 50 percent of grades are A- or above, and 50 percent are A- or below. In fact, the average GPA is likely lower than 3.67 since the distribution of grades is likely skewed to the left; you can’t go much higher than an A- but you can go much lower. So very poor grades pull the average GPA down more than very high grades pull it up, despite the fact that they affect the median in the same way.
Finally, since A and A- grades must comprise at least 50 percent of grades, and since A is the more common of the two, the smallest possible percentage of A’s must be a little more than 25 percent. (It is worth noting that A-minuses probably comprise the lower half of the distribution too, so the percentage of A’s is likely higher.) Eight years ago, 48.3 percent of grades were in the A range. Only a 1.7 percentage-point increase in the number of A-minuses would be needed to proclaim that the median grade is an A-. And given the leftward skew of grades, the current average GPA may not be too far from its 3.45 value in 2005. People are acting like things have changed drastically when the recent news is inconclusive.
This should offer solace to many students apparently distraught over the recent news. The student with the 3.8 GPA is, in fact, above average, and in the top third of her class if the GPAs are distributed with a 3.6 mean and a standard deviation of 0.5. The student who earns an A on the assignment does not need to lament that it is meaningless. And, more importantly, the students who are frustrated, wondering why everyone else seems to be getting A’s, need not be worried as that is just not the case. I appreciate the conversations and debate that the recent news about grade inflation has generated, but I want these discussions to be aligned with what statistics, not emotional alarm, reveal.
And the statistics don’t reveal much. That a mark indicating, to quote Harvard’s Handbook for Students, “full mastery” with “extraordinary distinction” (an A) is the most common grade at Harvard clearly indicates grade inflation. And that there are more students with full mastery and extraordinary distinction (those receiving A’s, per the Handbook) than there are students with full mastery but not extraordinary distinction (those receiving A-minuses) defies my understanding of what “extraordinary” means. But these notions (even if ridiculous) are largely compatible with what the distribution looked like a few years ago. 
Grade inflation is a sensitive issue that’s best addressed when its extent is understood. I urge Harvard to release informative statistics, like the actual distribution of grades and, more importantly, a distributional breakdown by concentration. This way, we’d have a more focused target and not hurt any specific departments in a corrective process. 
When we see statistics like those released by Dean Harris, we may think of grade inflation in the student body at large as one plump balloon. But this balloon is really an assortment of different departmental balloons, each with varying amounts of helium. Let’s ground our positions in illuminating statistics rather than speculation and extrapolation. Let’s find out how much helium is in each balloon before we try to pop anything.

In its first explicit attempt to attract high school students, edX will collaborate with College Board and Davidson College professors to create online mini-courses in calculus, physics, and macroeconomics based on difficult topics in the Advanced Placement curriculum.
Davidson professors will analyze data from College Board to create the courses. EdX, the virtual learning platform founded over a year ago by Harvard and MIT, will provide the technological tools to make these courses available to high school students, who constitute five to ten percent of its learners.
“The College Board has a huge amount of data on AP scores, so Davidson scholars looked at the data and said where [students are] having the most difficulty on exams,” said edX President Anant Agarwal.
Davidson College joined edX as an institutional partner in May. According to Davidson College President Carol E. Quillen, the AP project was “a significant but not the only factor” in the decision to form a partnership.
“Several of our faculty work already with high school teachers in a variety of contexts,” Quillen said. “We believe that these new technology tools that Harvard and MIT are developing through edX would be incredibly powerful in helping us work more effectively with high school teachers in a range of ways.”
Patrick Sellers, a political science professor and associate dean for curriculum at Davidson who will be spearheading the AP project, said that the Davidson professors involved in the project have decades of experience in writing, grading, and helping high school instructors teach the AP exams.
“The modules will benefit Davidson in that the students that come to Davidson, and to Harvard, hopefully will have a better grounding in the fundamental concepts,” Sellers said. “If we can improve the baseline knowledge that all students have in calculus, that will make them better mathematicians, better physicists, better chemists, better biochemists, and better in more areas.”
Although these long-term benefits cannot be quantified right away, Sellers said, researchers hope to eventually collect data to measure whether these AP course modules yield improvements in exam scores.
The AP project will first be piloted next year in the nearby Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district before being made generally available online in 2015 through the edX platform and the AP Central website.
Quillen said she expects that the mini-courses can be used in a blended learning format, in which online materials would deliver the traditional class time instruction, allowing class time to be used for group problem solving activities and individual attention.
“When a high school AP calculus teacher decides to use the calculus module in this project, they will be able to assign the units to the students and also take advantage of the materials in that module for them to help them learn how to teach the concepts in the blended learning format,” Sellers said.
Agarwal described high school years as important and “particularly close to [his] own heart.”
“At the end of the day, if students don’t have the right background for college courses, they won’t get much out of it,” he said.

Irish pub Tommy Doyle’s announced via Twitter on Thursday that it will close its Harvard Square location on Dec. 22. After nine years of business at the site of the original House of Blues, the pub will shut it doors, in part because of rising rents in the Square.
Tommy Doyle’s manager Garrett Tingle told The Crimson that closing the pub had been in discussion for a while due to rising rent, expensive maintenance, and repair costs, and a lack of outdoor seating. While business, he said, has been steady, increasing costs meant “it made sense to close down.”
Since its founding in 2005, Tommy Doyle’s has become a bustling social space for the Cambridge community. The pub, located at 96 Winthrop St., offers live music, trivia nights, and pub food and drinks.
Since the Thursday announcement, the company has received many supportive Facebook and Twitter messages from their patrons, current and former.
“People that have moved out of Cambridge and moved on with their lives are taking the time to email us,” Tingle said. “It shows you what a bar and restaurant can do in a community. It’s a social scene that people are really going to miss and love.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, echoed the sentiments of the Cambridge community.
“Tommy Doyle’s is a longtime, valued member of the Harvard Square Business Association,” Jillson wrote in an email. “The entire team will be missed.”
In addition to the larger Cambridge community, Tommy Doyle’s has forged a strong relationship with Harvard students and social groups. Since its founding, student organizations have used Tommy Doyle’s to host various fundraisers and social gatherings.
Fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi has hosted its annual Presidents’ Day Weekend fundraiser called the Raise the Roof Charity Party at the pub in the past.
“It’s always been a good environment and a good, local place for Harvard students to go and enjoy themselves,” said Evan A. Ribot ’14, the fraternity’s president.
James T. Looney ’14 said he has often attended trivia nights at Tommy Doyle’s and that “trivia people will miss it.”
As for the future of Tommy Doyle’s, it also operates locations in Kendall Square and Hyannis. According to Tingle, its owners plan to focus on their Kendall Square location and are looking for new potential locations in Cambridge, Somerville, or Boston.
Tingle, a native Cantabrigian, was a part of the team that unlocked the doors during Tommy Doyle’s opening in 2005 and said he will be there to close them this December.
“I couldn’t thank the community from top to bottom enough for essentially giving us nine great years in Harvard Square. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts,” Tingle said.
Tommy Doyle’s follows a trend of Harvard Square establishments deciding to close in part due to rising rents in the area. UpStairs on the Square will close Dec. 31, and the Dunkin’ Donuts at 1 Bow St. has yet to reveal when it will relocate.
Raj Dhanda, landlord to the Tommy Doyle’s location, could not be reached for comment.

Former College student and current Lowell House residence manager Elizabeth J. Powers ’10 launched on Friday an online marketplace for artwork created by individuals in art therapy programs at hospitals and shelters.
According to the organization’s website, ArtLifting serves to “empower sick, disabled, and homeless artists through the celebration and sale of their work.”
“There are many art programs that exist, but they are mostly insular, so no one from the outside community sees their work,” said Powers, who helped co-found the website. “So I wanted to build a model where they can go sell it.”
The profits from each sale are divided between the artist, who receives the majority share, the art therapy program, and the ArtLifting website itself to help pay the site’s operating costs.
“For every original piece sold, the money goes back to the art therapy program, so it could create two new pieces, so the people who don’t create sellable work can still get supported and create work,” Powers said.
Powers said she first began helping out the homeless as an undergraduate at Harvard by participating in the LIFT program, a nonprofit that, according to the group’s website, helps community members achieve economic stability.
In 2010, with the help of the Pforzheimer Postgraduate Public Service Fellowship, Powers founded an organization called City Heart to empower homeless and low-income artists through an annual art show to display and sell their work.
Even though this venture was successful, Powers said she believed it was not enough, so she decided to expand City Heart into ArtLifting.
The ArtLifting team includes other College affiliates, including Civry P. Melvin ’14, who said she became involved with ArtLifting as a former intern for City Heart.
Melvin and Powers said they already have a vision for how they wish to advance the project.
“As we just launched last Friday, we only have two Harvard undergrad interns,” Powers said. “I would like to expand involvement with Harvard groups, especially PBHA, because I have a lot of contacts there from undergrad.”
Melvin said she would like to see the project expanded to local businesses.
“We would love to [put] their art up on [local businesses’] walls as a means of advertising for the artists themselves, and so we have more of a partnership with the community,” Melvin said.

A global public health report co-authored by University professor Lawrence H. Summers, School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk, and Public Health professor Sue J. Goldie, among others, proposes an unprecedented investment framework to significantly reduce health disparities between the poorest and the wealthiest nations.
 
The report, entitled “Global Health 2035: A World Converging within a Generation,” was published this week in The Lancet and lays out a series of recommendations on issues ranging from research and development spending to increased taxes on tobacco and other harmful goods. 
 
The goal of the report is “to make the case for why investing in health is a prerequisite for building strong societies and why investing in health should be a top development priority,” Goldie said.
 
The report promotes the tackling of infectious diseases like malaria, AIDS, and tuberculosis, as well as non-communicable diseases caused by poor diet and exercise. The report also argues in favor of taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and sugar in order to reduce the frequency of these so-called “lifestyle” diseases.
 
The major goal of the report is to reach a point of “grand convergence” of health worldwide, which Summers described as “a once in human history chance to bring global mortality near industrial country levels.”
 
The three main goals of 2035 are to reduce mortality of children under five to 16 per 1,000 live births, annual AIDS deaths to 8 per 100,000 people, and annual tuberculosis deaths to 4 per 100,000. The authors contend that if the guidelines set forth in the report are adopted, 10 million deaths could be averted in 2035.
 
However, the success of the ambitious global health campaign requires political support. The biggest obstacle facing the implementation of the report’s suggestions is “finding political will,” Summers said in an emailed statement. The report estimates how much the plan would cost low-income and lower-middle-income countries each year if it were to be adopted.
 
The authors have been working on the report for nearly a year and have had major meetings in Boston, Norway, and Rwanda, according to Goldie. The project was designed as a follow-up to the World Development Report of 1993 and is intended for a broad audience.
“The primary target audiences for the report are decision-makers who play a key role in choices about social investments and allocation of funding—ranging from ministers of finance at the national level to development banks at the regional level, to…international health agencies at the global level,” Goldie said.

The February 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin sparked a nationwide discussion on race relations, one that was echoed across the Harvard community.
In response to demand for continued conversation on the topic, the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations organized a series of panels on race and justice that Foundation director S. Allen Counter intends to bring to all the Houses.
Since 1981, the Foundation has served to unite students of diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds in programs and initiatives that promote interracial and intercultural awareness.
In the past three decades, as the Harvard community has diversified, the Foundation has stepped up its role in supporting the activities and collaboration of student organizations, transforming the way that it influences cultural dialogue on campus.
WHY IT HAS CHANGED
While the Foundation was originally conceptualized as a solution to racial tensions at Harvard, the level of student mobilization on issues of race and cultural relations has increased since the its inception.
According to Counter, in the 1970s, Harvard began to admit minority students in significant numbers for the first time.
“Many students felt that they were in Harvard but not of Harvard,” Counter said.
At the time, there was much talk about the idea of a “Third World Center” to provide social and academic support for minority students, according to neuroscience professor John E. Dowling ’57, who has been a member of the Foundation’s faculty advisory committee since its inception. However, then-University President Derek C. Bok and the committee thought that a Third World Center would not have adequately addressed all of the issues present on a campus with a wide range of cultural groups and affiliations.
“They wanted to create something uniquely Harvard,” Counter said.
Bok organized a committee of faculty and students led by Reverend Peter J. Gomes to review proposals and efforts at other universities to foster race relations and promote identity for minority students. They aimed to create the best model for an institution that would respond to intercultural and race relations at the University—what would become the Harvard Foundation.
Bok and Gomes approached Counter to lead an umbrella organization for the multiplicity of student groups that sought a more prominent voice on campus.
Counter, who said he grew up in racially segregated Florida, traveled around the world for his studies. According to Counter, Bok and Gomes told him that his global experience made him a suitable candidate to direct the nascent organization.
In 1981, the University launched the Foundation as a center for students of all backgrounds.
As the Foundation has expanded its activities over the past 30 years, students have also formed their own organizations to address cultural and race relations on campus.
This expansion can be seen in the substantial proliferation of student groups affiliated with the organization’s Student Advisory Committee: from five at the Foundation’s start to over 80 today.
“The role of cultural organizations has changed just in my time at Harvard,” said Rabiya Ather ’15, president of the Harvard College Pakistani Students Association. “The want to understand and be aware of other cultures is constantly growing.”
Moreover, said Hassaan Shahawy ’16, a member of the board of the Harvard Islamic Society, organizations representing other cultures are becoming “more part of the institutionalized framework of the University.”
WHAT HAS CHANGED
To respond to a growing proliferation of student voices and activity on diversity, the Foundation has evolved in the way it connects organizations and advances cultural discourse. Members of student groups that work with the Foundation say that they increasingly look towards it as a source of expertise, as a platform for collaboration, and as a basis of support.
For years, groups that send representatives to the Foundation’s Student Advisory Committee have been able to request financial support for events that promote the discussion of minority issues. These representatives, along with the Foundation’s student interns, play a crucial role in determining the allocation of these funds, according to Dowling.
In addition to allocating funds, the team of undergraduate interns also initiates and organizes the events that the Foundation hosts. They act as liaisons to specific Student Advisory Committee groups, answering questions and providing resources as they plan their own initiatives.
Groups that share common goals are often at risk of “working alone,” said to Hilary J. Higgins ’15, president of Latinas Unidas.
“The Foundation is a powerful platform for groups and the University to collaborate on these issues,” she said.
The Foundation has different levels of interaction with different student groups. Aubrey J. Walker ’15, an intern at the organization, said “the groups use us as they see fit.”
Walker said that the organization is making a comprehensive effort to decrease barriers between the interns and administrators of the Foundation and the leaders of the array of groups affiliated with the Student Advisory Committee, opening up more effective communication channels between them.
The Foundation also reaches out to students and groups that are not involved with the Student Advisory Committee, like the Harvard College Pakistani Students Association.
“When the Foundation is working on an event that involves a particular culture, it tries to get a student group associated with that culture involved,” said Ather, president of the HCPSA. For instance, the Foundation contacted the HCPSA to “make Malala Yousafzai feel at home” during her visit to Harvard this September.
Student intern Eric Lu ’14 notes that all who work at the Foundation “keep themselves aware of the issues of today.” This constant push to respond to issues quickly prompts events like the series of panels inspired by the Trayvon Martin case.
To Neimy K. Escobar ’15, co-chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, the primary benefit of the Foundation is its expertise in promoting discussion within diverse communities.
“[Some groups] do not have the historical experience about how to go about it, which is where the Foundation comes in,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 150 students from Harvard and other Boston-area colleges rallied Sunday afternoon at the Weeks Footbridge to continue pressuring their administrations to divest their endowments from fossil fuel companies.
Canyon S. Woodward ’15, one of the rally coordinators, said that student protesters hoped to demonstrate to university presidents that divestment activists will not give up the cause until their objectives are met. The rally comes a little more than two months after Harvard President Drew G. Faust released a letter detailing the reasons for the University’s unwillingness to commit to divestment.
“The goal was to target all of our presidents of our respective universities and show them powerfully by coming together and pooling our resources that when they reject our demands for divestment, our campaigns will only escalate and build and ramp up the pressure,” Woodward said. He added that this was the first coordinated action between the divestment movements of Boston area schools.
The student-protesters—from Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, Tufts University, Brandeis University, MIT, Northeastern University, Wellesley College, Olin College of Engineering, and Lesley University—began the demonstration at the Weeks Footbridge on the Charles River. After draping much of the bridge under a one-thousand square foot banner emblazoned with the words “Divest from the Climate Crisis,” students heard from climate activist Tim DeChristopher, who co-founded the environmental group Peaceful Uprising.
The group then marched to Massachusetts Hall, where students read aloud from a letter addressed to Faust and written together by students from Harvard and peer institutions whose administrations have recently ruled out divestment.
“Our alums, our faculty and staff, and our students are what make our schools great,” the letter said. “We will leverage the collective power of these groups to demand our universities do what is right.”
Sunday’s protest and letter-delivery is part of a national movement; similar actions at Middlebury College and Pomona College are planned for Monday and were organized in coordination with the protest in Cambridge.
Luke T. Sherman, a Tufts student involved with the Tufts Divest for Our Future movement, said that he thinks the collaboration between divestment movements at different schools is beneficial because it enables organizers to share effective practices and spread their message to a wider audience. When one university agrees to divest, he added, others will likely follow suit.
“I think it will be a domino effect because it puts increased social pressure on those who are not agreeing to divest,” Sherman said. “Once it becomes more widely accepted by the global community and the academic community that our current investments in fossil fuel are socially toxic, it becomes harder and harder for those same universities not to believe the same ideology.”

After years of back-and-forth negotiations with the University, the town of Weston, Mass. announced recently that it plans to obtain by eminent domain a portion of Harvard-owned land in the Case Estates property.
 
According to the MetroWest Daily News, the town has offered the University $360,000 for the 1.6 acre parcel of land that it seeks to acquire.
 
However, the University has not reached an agreement with Weston regarding the value of the land.
 
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email to The Crimson that University and town officials have long discussed using a small portion of the Case Estates property for municipal parking, but that the fair market value of the land parcel has yet to be determined.
 
Under eminent domain laws, any body of government can acquire private property for public use as long as it provides prñoper compensation for the land.
 
According to the Metrowest article, Michael Harrity, a member of Weston’s Board of Selectman, said that the town reached the $360,000 amount by subtracting $540,000, the cost of making the land a legal lot with a private road, from the total appraised value of the land, $900,000. 
 
Harrity said that Harvard has two years to appeal the town’s evaluation of the land, which it plans to use for additional parking space for the neighboring Case Campus, an area that includes the Weston Library, Community Center, and the Country, Woodland, and Field Schools, according to the article.
 
The Case Estates, a botanical garden that once housed nurseries for Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, has been at the center of negotiations between the University and Weston since 1985, when, according to the Weston government website, Harvard sold 35.65 acres of the land to the town.
 When Harvard announced plans to sell the remaining 62.5 acres of the Estates in 2006, the town officials held a special town meeting in which they voted to spend $22.5 million to purchase the land for open space, municipal purposes, and residential use, according to the MetroWest article. Subsequent soil testing conducted by Weston led town officials to reevaluate the value of the land, protracting negotiations between the town and the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Through 40 minutes, senior goalkeeper Raphael Girard looked unbeatable against the defending national champions. In the last 25, he was caught looking twice, but the night still belonged to the Quebecois.
Girard posted a career-high 52 saves as the Crimson dropped a two-goal lead in the third period to tie No. 8 Yale, 2-2, in New Haven on Saturday night.
In the 240th meeting between the two rivals, second period goals from freshmen forwards Alex Kerfoot and Luke Esposito gave the Crimson (4-7-2, 2-6-2 ECAC) an early lead. But the Bulldogs (6-3-3, 3-2-3) responded in the final frame of regulation with strikes from junior defenseman Matt Killian and senior forward Kenny Agostino.
After two periods, Girard had already seen a game’s worth of shots, turning away Yale’s first 31 attempts on goal. The senior can now boast a conference-best .948 save percentage.
“[Girard] stood on his head, and he’s been doing that since day one,” Kerfoot said. “Every time he’s back there, you feel like you have a chance to win. He’s incredibly athletic, and that gives you a lot of confidence playing in front of him.”
This week Girard started in back-to-back games for the first time this year. The senior from Saint-Hyacinthe, Que., had 33 stops in the Crimson’s 2-1 loss against Dartmouth on Friday.
On Saturday, three of Girard’s saves came in overtime. In the extra frame, Harvard enjoyed the better of the opportunities but ultimately left a point in the standings on the table.
“As much as we’re not satisfied with the tie, it was a good effort, and I thought we competed,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
In the first period, Girard showed that he would be tough to beat. The senior was peppered with shots in the final minutes of the opening frame as the home team closed out the period on a power play.
The Crimson got on the board first on the power play. A screening Kerfoot put away his third goal of the season after corralling a deflected shot from sophomore line-mate Jimmy Vesey.
The visitors punctuated the middle frame with key plays on both sides of the ice. Girard provided a kick-save on a shot high in the slot from Gus Young with 30 seconds left in the frame. Off the next faceoff, a slap shot from junior defenseman Patrick McNally bounced off the right pad of Lyon and onto the stick of Esposito, who buried his third goal of the year 13 seconds before the intermission.
Girard finally made a mistake early in the third period. After a stuff-attempt from freshman Yale forward Matt Killian, the senior failed to locate the puck under his pads before Killian poked it between the pipes to draw the home team within one.
The score gave Yale new life as the Bulldogs registered a period-high 20 shots in the final frame. Yet Harvard continued to force most of the Bulldogs’ opportunities to the outside. Junior defender Max Everson broke up a Yale 2-on-1 with ten minutes left in regulation.
With six minutes to play in regulation, Yale’s persistence paid off with a strike from its leading scorer. Agostino faked a cross-ice pass before beating Girard five-hole with a wrist shot from the right-wing faceoff circle to knot the score at two.
With less than four minutes left in regulation, a cross-checking minor to Yale defenseman Rob O’Gara gave the Crimson a power play. The visitors had broken their dry spell on their first man-up chance of the game, but the Crimson could only muster a shot on goal with the score knotted at two.
In overtime, the Crimson’s best chance came with 40 seconds left in the game, after a rebound off a shot from the point man Everson bounced onto the skate of center Sean Malone, who had open net on the right wing. But the freshman could not transfer the puck to his stick before Lyon could regroup.
For Donato, the final score was disappointing but a step in the right direction.
“We’re a little disappointed with the lead going into the third and not being able to secure a victory, but once they scored to tie the game, I thought we really responded well and had some good chances,” Donato said. “I thought we carried the play in overtime.”
Harvard now sits tenth in the ECAC as it heads into a three-week break on a three-game winless streak. The Crimson will next face Yale on Jan. 11 in the Rivalry On Ice game, a nationally-televised non-conference match-up at Madison Square Garden.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after its last competition of the 2012-2013 season, the Harvard track and field team took to the stadium once again to start off the indoor track season.
Harvard played host to a number of schools at Gordon Indoor Track, including Holy Cross, St. Rose and Dartmouth, and the team produced solid results with regularity. The finals of the women’s 60 meter dash, for example, saw the Crimson taking four of the top five places; the women’s 300 meter dash was even more one-sided, with Harvard placing in all of the top nine spots except for seventh place.
“Overall, I was really pleased,” said Jason Saretsky, coach of the team’s distance runners. “It’s really early, but I think we’ve seen some really great performances…. I feel really good with where we’re at.”
Sophomore Autumne Franklin finished first in the 300 meter dash. Freshman Jade Miller finished 0.34 seconds after Franklin, and classmate Jackie Modesett took third. All three of the underclassmen clocked in sub-41 second finishes for the race.
“It was nice to see the girls getting so close to the school records this early in the season,” junior Owen Laub said. “A lot of the freshmen [are] really showcasing what talent they had and are getting a sense of what their specialty is.”
Laub, who has been running on the team for three years, showcased some impressive results of his own. In the men’s 300 meter dash, the junior finished second behind classmate Jarvis Harris and tied with freshman James Heckendorn with a time of 35.66 seconds. That race saw all but one of the first nine finishes being claimed by Harvard sprinters—a repeat of the women’s 300 meter dash.
Such a firm grip on the race results, however, seemed to be less apparent when Dartmouth entered the equation. In the men’s 60 meter dash, for example, the top ten finishes included runners from Dartmouth, Saint Rose, Harvard, as well as Holy Cross; the same was true for the men’s one-mile run, where Harvard senior Ryan Romain took first place with a time of 4:16.
Nonetheless, the Crimson still had other highlights among the many events. In the field, freshman Julian Nunally registered a 14.49-meter throw in the shot put to finish second behind Jonathan Beering of Dartmouth. Harris, who finished first for the 300 meter dash, also took first place in the men’s 60 meter hurdles. And to cap it all off, the final event with Crimson competitors—the men’s 3,000 meter run—witnessed juniors Connor Reck and Neph Maritim finish one-two, respectively.
“For both of us, the longest event we’ve got on the track is the 1,500 meters,” Reck said. “This is obviously twice as long, and we came in knowing that it was going to be a real grind, and that it was going to feel long. We had a bit of help from our coach rabbiting the first mile…[but] I was lucky to have my teammate holding the pace for those next few laps before I felt good again for the kick.”
“It was a very great beginning today for the indoor season,” Maritim added. “This is just the first race in many that will come in the course of next semester. It’s a great beginning for us; we were hoping to be in this kind of shape at the beginning of the season, and we are right on pace.”
Reck finished the race with a time of 8:32.10, while Maritim was just three hundredths of a second behind at 8:32.13.
For distances beyond that, the most exciting might be yet to come. As Romain noted, members of the men and women’s cross country teams were not even competing yet.
“We really have a great shot to do [well] at Heps this year,” Romain said. “There’s a lot of people who aren’t racing in this meet from cross country, and they just finished an amazing season so overall, it’s looking pretty bright right now.
Senior Maksim Korolev, in particular, has the potential to lead the way. The co-captain of the men’s cross country team claimed first place at Heps—the Ivy League championship—in November, and finished third at Nationals just weeks afterwards.
For now, however, it is the indoor track and field season, which is the primary focus. And for a good portion of the team, the outlook seems to be bright.
“I couldn’t be happier with where they’re at right now,” Harvard coach Tim Bayley said. “They’re [in] a really great spot going into the [winter] break, and I’m excited for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off one of its toughest losses of the season in the opener of the Arizona State Classic, the Harvard women’s basketball team did not want to leave Phoenix without a victory.
After a hard-fought battle in the frontcourt, the Crimson nabbed one on Sunday at the Wells Fargo Arena against Sacred Heart.
 
Harvard 74, Sacred Heart 63
After trading baskets with the Pioneers (2-6) for the majority of the first half, Harvard (7-3) utilized a 12-1 run midway through the second stanza to emerge victorious in Sunday’s consolation game, 74-63.
“We wanted to get redemption and show each other and show everybody else who was watching in the audience what Harvard basketball was all about because yesterday wasn’t a testament to that at all,” junior forward Erin McDonnell said.
Returning from the locker room at halftime with a 34-29 lead, the Crimson knocked down seven of its first nine shots in the second half to build a commanding lead. That lead nearly reached its peak with 9:14 remaining, when a three-pointer from senior guard Jasmine Evans put Harvard up 55-38, capping the team’s huge run.
Sacred Heart would respond. After the Crimson’s lead reached nineteen points with 4:11 remaining, the Pioneers rattled off a 14-4 run of its own to pull within nine with a little over a minute to go.
Nonetheless, Harvard put the game away at the free throw line and with one last basket from the game’s leading scorer, junior forward Temi Fagbenle.
Fagbenle carried the Crimson offense with 22 points and 11 rebounds, earning her second consecutive double-double, and her fourth of the season.
“My teammates have been feeding me very well on the floor,” Fagbenle said. “They’re getting the ball in and out [of the paint]…and the fact that they’ve been able to get the ball to me as much as they [have has been really good].”
Harvard shot 52 percent from the field in the second half, marking a sharp turnaround from the first half in which the team shot a meager 37 percent.
In the early going, it appeared as though the Crimson’s struggles on Saturday were carrying over into its second contest. The Pioneers scored the game’s opening seven points, holding Harvard scoreless for about four minutes.
However, McDonnell provided a spark for the Crimson offense throughout the first half, keeping them in the game with great shooting. The forward hit all four shots that she took in the opening frame, including three from beyond the arc. She finished with 17 points.
“I wanted to win,” McDonnell said. “The sense of shoving it down their throats and showing Sacred Heart that we’re that much better [gave] me a lot of momentum.”
Long Beach State 72, Harvard 67
 
On Saturday, Harvard appeared to be well on its way to punching its ticket to the final, holding a 23-point lead over Long Beach State with 16:15 remaining in the game.
However, a furious second-half rally by the 49ers put that plan on hold, as Long Beach State (5-2) stormed back to beat the Crimson, 72-67.
With 12:47 to play, the 49ers immediately began to turn the game around, going on a 23-2 run over the next seven minutes, which cut the lead to 60-59.
The lead finally shifted hands with 3:06 remaining, after junior forward Ella Clark hit a three to put LBSU up by one. The 49ers would not relinquish that lead, largely in part to Clark who earned five more points down the stretch and had 17 for the game.
“We get conservative, we get cautious [and] we don’t play our game when the heat’s on,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I can’t remember a game in my last 30 years that we’ve lost a [23]-point lead, so I’m pretty disappointed about it to be honest.”
The first half had been a different story for the Crimson. Harvard had success against the 49ers’ press, building a 39-26 lead at the break in the process. Fagbenle scored 10 of her 15 points in the first frame, and sophomore guard Shilpa Tummala put up all 6 of her points in the opening half, while playing in front of her hometown.
“We were just having so much fun with each other [in the first half],” McDonnell said. “We weren’t thinking. We were playing, but there was no thinking out there.”
Yet, Harvard could not repeat its first-half success. The Crimson turned the ball over 18 times in the second frame, finishing with 28 on the game. These turnovers led to 28 LBSU points, ultimately proving to be the difference.
“It was obviously disappointing that we weren’t able to sustain that lead, but we learned from that experience,” Fagbenle said. “[It’s] something that obviously hurt a lot, and we will never ever repeat that.”
One obstacle that Harvard had to overcome in both games was the absence of its leading scorer Christine Clark. The co-captain missed both games of the tournament with an injury that she suffered in the team’s previous game against St. John’s.
“[Clark is] obviously a very important piece of our team,” said Delaney-Smith. “She has a level of work ethic and intensity and leadership that when we can’t have her on the floor, we miss it. That was certainly the case in both games.”
The loss moved the Crimson into the consolation game, while the 49ers moved on to play Arizona State in the championship.

This year’s UC presidential election process, which seems finally to have come to a close last night, has given us more whiplash than the most fearsome of roller coasters. With all the twists, turns, and dramatic plot twists that went on right here on our own campus, suddenly everything else suddenly seemed less exciting in comparison. Here are some examples.
Epic of GilgameshThe memories of this UC election cycle may last even longer than the earliest works of literature, such as Mesopotamia’s Epic of Gilgamesh. The Epic of Gilgamesh has survived millennia—a blink of the eye compared to this unfolding saga.
 
The Capture of ConstantinopleNot only did the Byzantines fortify their city with meter-thick walls, in 1453 they even took the precaution of chaining the Golden Horn inlet of the Bosphorus. However, this was not enough to keep out Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who had his troops pull their naval ships across greased logs on land to avoid the chain and successfully capture the city.
 
Man Landing on the MoonNeil Armstrong and crew did the unthinkable, venturing into space and the unknown. America watched from living room televisions, not knowing once the spaceship sailed into the black abyss whether it would ever come back.
 
The Last Scene of "Titanic"You know, that infamous scene where Rose clings onto the last piece of floating wood, and Leonardo Di Caprio is left to paddle along beside her in the frigid waters? There was obviously room for the both of them on the log if Rose had only scooted over a bit. Can Leo survive? To the disappointment of all teenage girls ever, he doesn’t—the most dramatic point in the entire movie.
 
John F. Kennedy’s 1960 ElectionFresh-faced JFK had a narrowly-fought battle against sitting VP Richard Nixon to become America’s 35th president, and he won by less than one percent of the popular vote.

The end of the semester is a stressful time, and we all need to remember to relax every now and then. Flyby is here to help! This is the fifth installment in our Seven Days of Reading Period series, inspired by "The Twelve Days of Christmas." Stay tuned for more!
On the fifth day of reading period, Flyby gave to me five tips to help finish a final paper in one night.CaffeineAs much as possible. Seriously. You may not be able to stay up all night, but you after drinking a venti coffee with three espresso shots might have a chance.Find your playlistNothing makes you lose motivation faster than the hearing the birds tweeting outside Lamont at 5 a.m. Distract yourself by listening to music; some people like pump-up songs, some like classical, and some are partial to epic movie soundtracks.Hide Friends are great….when you have time for them. When you’re writing a paper, however, they are black holes of distraction just waiting for you to fall into their trap. Save yourself by going somewhere where no one will find you.NourishmentRookie mistake = forgetting to eat while you’re pulling an all-nighter. Just because you don’t normally have meals in the middle of the night doesn’t mean you can work for 12 hours without food. Tip: working near a vending machine is the best way to make sure you’ll have access to snacks at all hours.Set goalsCompleting a 20 page paper in less than 24 hours can seem like a daunting and impossible task. You know what seems way less impossible? Finding five quotes in one source. Writing a page in an hour. Getting to eight pages by midnight. Set goals, hold yourself to them, and watch yourself become productive. Even better, promise yourself rewards when you complete them.
