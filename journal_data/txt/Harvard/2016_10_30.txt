After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In dropping his album for free three days earlier than its scheduled Oct. 17 release date, Gucci Mane may have hoped to generate hype by surprising his fans. Instead, the subdued release of “WOPTOBER” categorically failed to engage the overwhelming majority of his 2.6 million Twitter followers. That’s the thing with Gucci Mane: You might know his name, but it’s unlikely you know his music—and if you do, it’s even more unlikely that you’ve gone out and bought it.
“WOPTOBER” is an appropriately bad title for an album that frankly falls short of achieving anything at all. The production is generic, and the lyrics are mind-numbingly repetitive. For the majority of one song Mane rhymes “time” with “time.” Perhaps the most stupefying aspect of the album is that a solid 10 out of the 13 tracks all run at the same exciting tempo of approximately 74 beats per minute, which might be a decent resting heart rate in an adult human but is decidedly tedious for 43 minutes of badly-produced drivel.
Throughout the 13 tracks of monotonous rap, there are numerous instances of clumsy phrasing wherein Mane tries to squeeze more syllables into the line that can happily fit. As such, the caliber of the verse construction is akin to that song you were forced to write and perform in middle school as part of a “fun” class project. What differentiates “WOPTOBER” from your seventh-grade tragedy, however, is the fact that Mane has no shame in releasing music of such uninspired quality. On “Love Her Body,” for example, Mane asks the question, “Do I love my bitch or am I in love with her body?” 16 times in a row. If he doesn’t know after the first 10 queries, it seems unlikely that he’s going to find out. “Right On Time” sees him repeat the lyric “right on time” 22 times per hook. By the 13th cycle, even Mane himself sounds bored.
As far as production goes, “WOPTOBER” sounds like it was overseen using only GarageBand and Apple Loops. In other words, the production doesn’t make Mane’s rapping any worse—there is a steady tempo, at least—but neither does it do anything to even slightly enhance Mane’s lyricism.  Indeed, it would seem that production is one of Mane’s lesser concerns. This is Mane’s second album of 2016 thus far, and after July’s “Everybody Looking,” it is clear that with Mane, we should expect quantity over quality. In comparison to the production on his previous release, which had some elements of well-considered musicality, “WOPTOBER” displays only a vast plethora of uninteresting beats.
In releasing this album, Mane has simply failed to add anything new to the rap scene whatsoever: “WOPTOBER” is full to the brim of generic, repetitive narratives with little to no real substance. Sex, drugs and money are not revolutionary concepts anymore. Gucci Mane, despite what some might describe as his best efforts, has been far surpassed by his contemporaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than four minutes remained in Saturday’s matchup between Harvard (5-1, 4-0 Ivy) and Dartmouth (3-4, 0-4 Ivy). The Big Green was down 23-14. The ball was pinned deep in its territory.
On first-and-five, the snap came in low, evading quarterback Jack Heneghan. The junior sprinted backwards, grabbed the pigskin, and slung it deep across the middle. It was an underthrown pass, and junior linebacker Luke Hutton extended his full body length for the interception. Game over. Seemingly.
But the football gods had other plans. After the play, the referees whistled sophomore defensive end DJ Bailey for roughing the passer, negating the interception and sending Harvard coach Tim Murphy into unusual fury.
Dartmouth then charged down the field, scoring with 2:32 left in the game. New life for Dartmouth. Seemingly. Now losing 23-21, the Big Green elected to kick the ball deep to the Crimson.
However, Harvard ended the comeback bid in Hanover, N.H. with a pair of key third-down conversions—one scrambled by senior quarterback Joe Viviano and one caught by senior halfback Anthony Firkser. Final score: Crimson 23, Big Green 21.
“Typical Dartmouth game,” Murphy said. “[It] goes down to the last play of the game…. I think if you look at our league right now, that’s what it’s all about. Every game is going down to the last possession.”
The Harvard offense got going early thanks to a turnover. On the second play from scrimmage, sophomore quarterback Bruce Dixon IV wobbled a ball down the right sideline; following the model set by Cornell, Dartmouth clearly was hoping to test the Crimson secondary deep. In this case, however, senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee undercut the throw for an interception.
The pick led to quick points. On third-and-six from the 12, Viviano fit the ball into a tight window for sophomore receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, who made the catch in traffic for the first Crimson score.
The Harvard offense relied on the running game in the first half. Of the team’s 167 yards before intermission, 111 came on the ground. This strategy contrasted with the Dartmouth approach, as the hosts accumulated 31 rushing yards versus 155 passing yards before halftime.
However, the visitors’ offense ended the game with surprising balance. Although the Crimson started Saturday averaging roughly 100 more passing yards per game than rushing, the visitors totaled 199 yards on the ground and 206 yards through the air. And while Harvard had given up 10 sacks in the last two games, Viviano was not tackled for a loss once Saturday.
“I think [the lack of sacks] was a mixture of a few things, but our offensive line is an unbelievable unit,” Viviano said. “Today we had a lot of healthy guys out there, which helps. And the offensive line, they did an unbelievable job.”
Surprisingly the Big Green started Dixon IV on Saturday rather than usual first-stringer Heneghan. However, after Dixon IV went one-for-six with an interception, Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens called on Heneghan.
“I was surprised, but on the other hand, I know they were trying to balance their offense to some extent,” Murphy said. “That decision certainly made sense to me from the standpoint of, ‘Here’s a guy that’s a dual threat—he can carry the football.’”
Momentum shifted as soon the junior stepped onto the field. Compared to Dixon IV’s 28 yards through the air, Heneghan passed for 299 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for one—a seven-yard dash late in the fourth to cap a 72-yard drive.
After shooting to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, Harvard stagnated. The second period proved lackluster for both teams. The first five drives of the quarter ended in either a punt or, in one case, a failed conversion on fourth down.
Right before half, though, Heneghan sparked the Big Green. On the last drive of the quarter, Dartmouth did what the Seattle Seahawks failed to do in Super Bowl XLIX: complete a one-yard slant for a touchdown. That score brought the Big Green within seven heading into the locker room.
Despite bursts of offense, drops plagued Dartmouth all game. One particularly painful mistake came early in the fourth quarter, when Heneghan lofted a pass to freshman receiver Hunter Hagdorn. Wide open down the right side, Hagdorn let the ball hit him in the breastplate, dropping a likely touchdown with the Big Green down 23-14.
“You expect guys to make plays in critical situations,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “It’s the what-ifs, but we’ve got to be a football team that makes those plays. Harvard makes those plays.”
