After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team has made a habit of starting slow this season, often falling behind early or letting inferior opponents hang around until it finds its rhythm in the second half. Not the case on Saturday afternoon.
Facing George Washington (6-11, 0-2 A-10), the Crimson (15-2, 1-0 Ivy) came out of the gate with stifling defense and a balanced offensive attack, starting the game with a quick 15-4 run en route to a 69-48 win at Lavietes Pavilion.
The Crimson dominated in its best defensive first half of the season, as the Colonials scored only 13 points on 15 percent shooting from the field. George Washington's leading scorer, Tony Taylor, was held to just five points on one-for-seven shooting in the half, thanks largely to the efforts of junior guard Brandyn Curry.
“Our defense has been our calling card,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s what’s allowed us to be successful thus far.”
The Colonials responded to Harvard’s fast start with a 7-0 run of their own, cutting their deficit to four. But the game got no closer, as the Crimson answered with 10 straight points, part of an 18-2 run to close out the half, and went into the locker room up 33-13.
The Colonials offense was no longer anemic in the second half, but a relentless Crimson attack made it impossible for them to chip away at the lead. Sophomore Laurent Rivard, who scored 16 points while starting in place of the injured Christian Webster, drained an early three-pointer as he was fouled and made the free throw, one of his two four-point-plays on the afternoon. George Washington spent the rest of the half searching for a rhythm they would never find.
Harvard was paced by Freshman forward Steve Moundou-Missi, who came off the bench and scored 11 of his career high 16 points in the second half, including two thunderous dunks and his first career three-pointer. Co-captain Keith Wright finished with 11 points (eight of which came in the first half) and eight rebounds, while Curry dished out seven assists.
The Crimson’s blazing start, highlighted by a baseline drive and dunk from junior Kyle Casey, was only briefly interrupted by George Washington guard Aaron Ware, who made two free throws and drained a three before teammate David Pellom made a layup to pull the Colonials within four with just under 12 minutes to play in the half.
Freshman wing Wesley Saunders broke a five-minute scoring drought for Harvard with two made free throws, and Casey was fouled as he made a layup on the Crimson’s next possession.
After two consecutive defensive stops, Rivard drove to the lane and dished to Wright who threw it down. After coming up with a loose ball seconds later, Wright dribbled the length of the floor and returned the favor, finding Rivard for the easy two that put Harvard ahead, 23-11, with 6:30 to play in the half.
After another Wright layup, Taylor paused the Crimson run with two made free throws, but Harvard closed the half with eight straight points, capped off by a three-pointer from Moundou-Missi as the shot clock ran down.
The Colonials shooting improved significantly in the second half, but Harvard’s lead never fell below 16. Junior guard Lasan Kromah scored all 12 of his points in the second half and Taylor added eight of his team-high 13, but George Washington had no answer for the balanced Crimson offense.
“I don’t think they were ready for how hard we came out.” Rivard said.
The 13 points allowed in the first half matches the Crimson’s stingiest frame of the season (Harvard held Boston College to 13 second-half points on Dec. 29). George Washington’s 49 points is its lowest output on the season.
“I think on the perimeter we took away their shots,” Rivard said. “They didn’t really have second chance points.”
Harvard shot an impressive 65 percent in the game, largely thanks to perfect shooting performances from Moundou-Missi and Wright, while Rivard misfired on just one three-point attempt in the first.
Taylor managed to match his season average with 13 points but was inefficient, going three of 12 from the field.
“We really tried to make it difficult for him,” Amaker said. “I thought we did a really nice job of that.”
Junior guard Christian Webster missed the game with a hip injury while freshman Corbin Miller was out with a strained ligament in his thumb. Both are day-to-day, said Amaker, who is hopeful they will return in time for Saturday’s matchup at Dartmouth.
“The main thing I’m hopeful for,” Amaker said, “is to keep the constant defensive presence that we’ve had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sports, the difference between winning and losing can often come down to the smallest of margins, and on Saturday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team found itself falling literally just inches short of what would have been the biggest win of its season to date.
Late in the third period, the Crimson was up, 3-2, against No. 6 Boston University when Terriers’ forward Ben Rosen fired a backhanded shot off the left goalpost.
The referees initially ruled no goal, but video replay showed the puck to have just squeaked over the goal line before Harvard freshman goaltender Steve Michalek could dive on it, giving the Terriers a game-tying score.
Just over two minutes into the ensuing overtime period, BU squashed the Crimson’s upset attempt and finished off its comeback when the Terriers’ Garrett Noonan scored off a rebound to give BU a 4-3 victory.
The one-goal win at the sold out Bright Hockey Center gave the Terriers (13-6-1, 10-4-1 America East) a bit of revenge for the Crimson’s (4-6-6, 3-4-4 ECAC) thrilling comeback 5-4 victory in last season’s Beanpot consolation game.
“I thought we played well for the first 40 minutes,” junior forward Alex Fallstrom said. “And then we let them take over a little bit, which ended up costing us the game.”
One night after the Crimson saw its 18-game streak with a power-play goal halted, the Crimson’s man-up attack came out roaring on Saturday, scoring three times in the first period.
Fallstrom put the Crimson on the board with a score 3:06 into the contest, redirecting a Marshall Everson slap shot from the right of the goal past BU goalie Kieran Millan.
“I went in and I dropped it to [Everson],” Fallstrom said. “He took a shot, which I deflected into pretty much an open net.”
After neither team could find the back of the goal for the subsequent 13 minutes, the end of the period produced an offensive onslaught.
BU’s Chris Connolly tallied his first score of the season to tie things up at the 16:32 mark of the period, putting back a rebound of an Adam Clendening attempt for a power-play goal.
Fallstrom responded with his second score of the contest—and his seventh of the season— a minute later.
“We caused a turnover and [Everson and I] came in on a two-on-one,” Fallstrom said. “Their goalie came out really far, so I just faked a shot, took it to the middle, and just put it in an empty net.”
Following a blown two-on-one opportunity for the Terriers, forward Alex Killorn gave Harvard a two-goal lead with just nine seconds to go in the period. The senior orchestrated a give-and-go with classmate Eric Kroshus before firing past Millan for his 10th goal of the season.
Neither team could score in the second, despite each having two power-play opportunities. Harvard outshot BU by a 13-5 margin during the frame but could not convert, with Fallstrom just missing a chance for a hat trick by hitting the post behind the BU netminder.
“I thought we played really well in the first two periods,” sophomore defenseman Dan Ford said. “[But] in the third period we came out a little flat and didn’t stick with what brought us success in the first two.”
The Terriers took advantage of that flatness and cut the deficit to one when Connolly put back a rebound with 11:09 to go in the game.
“I feel like their second goal was kind of a momentum shifter for them,” Fallstrom said. “I think we had the game under control up until that point, and after that they really got going and started creating a lot of opportunities.”
Soon after, Rosen tied the game with his first goal of the year following a scramble around the Harvard crease.
In the overtime, after a Crimson neutral zone turnover, Michalek saved a Connolly attempt from the right but left the rest of the net exposed. The rebound went directly to a trailing Noonan, who was able to easily put back the rebound to give BU the win.
“We probably stopped attacking as much offensively,” Ford said. “That just led to them having more puck possession, and they put a lot of pressure on us and were able to get two goals.”
Alex Chiasson assisted on the final three Terrier scores, joining Clendening with three assists on the evening. Everson had two assists for Harvard, while Michalek made 30 saves in defeat.
It was the second straight 4-3 win over an intra-city rival for BU, which was coming off a victory over Northeastern. The Crimson lost its second straight after falling to No. 14 Union at Fenway Park Friday night.
“We definitely learned from this game that when you’re protecting a lead in the third period, you’ve got to play smart, but you’ve still got to attack offensively,” Ford said. “We kind of stopped doing that and played a little more passively. There’s too much time to just sit on a two-goal lead against a good team for two periods like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prior to its game Saturday afternoon against visiting George Washington, the No. 25 Harvard men’s basketball team had been plagued by sluggish starts. In its previous seven contests—against six teams currently holding a losing record—the Crimson had held a lead at the 10-minute mark in the first half just twice.
While Harvard eventually managed to notch four double-digit margins of victory during the span, its early-game performance became a key area of concern for a team closing out its non-conference schedule this weekend.
At least for one afternoon, consider those worries allayed. With 9:11 remaining in the opening half, the Crimson held a six-point lead before jumping out on a 14-2 run to enter halftime with a 33-13 lead.
“Coach always says, ‘If we don’t start right, we don’t have a good chance of ending right,’” sophomore wing Laurent Rivard said.
Harvard proved coach Tommy Amaker’s philosophy correct, establishing a lead as large as 24 before coming away with a wire-to-wire 69-48 victory for its 23rd straight win at home—currently the fifth-longest streak in the nation.
Last year, the Crimson trailed the Colonials by seven at halftime before coming back for a 67-62 road win.
But this season’s edition wasted no time in reestablishing its dominance over an Atlantic-10 conference team. George Washington represented the third squad from the conference Harvard has faced in five games.
“Harvard is a very good team,” Colonials coach Mike Lonergan said. “They put on a clinic and destroyed us. The game was over at halftime.”
M&Ms
After grabbing six points, two blocks, and a steal in 12 minutes of first-half action, junior big man Kyle Casey picked up his fourth foul with 15:24 remaining in the second half. Though the Harvard star did not return to the floor until five minutes left in the game, Amaker’s lineup experienced no dropoff in production, as freshman Steve Moundou-Missi came off the bench to notch a career-high 16 points and lead all scorers on 7-of-7 shooting from the floor.
“He gave us great minutes today,” Amaker said. “Catching the ball strong with two hands, rebounding it, and doing some things we expect him to do. Making every shot he takes is probably a little too much to ask, but we liked the energy he’s giving us off the bench and the aggressiveness around the rim, finishing around the goal and at the foul line.”
On his first appearance in the second half, the Cameroon native finished at the basket off a pass from junior point guard Brandyn Curry. Several possessions later, the guard found a charging Moundou-Missi along the baseline for another layup.
The next time down the court, the forward hit a desperation jumper late in the shot clock. A minute and a half later, classmate Wesley Saunders passed baseline to Moundou-Missi, who elevated for a one-handed dunk.
“Basketball’s just a game,” Moundou-Missi said. “You feel it, and you don’t have to think about it. You let yourself go into the game and just make some incredible plays, and that’s what happened.”
Perhaps his most incredible play of the afternoon—even more noteworthy than his first collegiate three-pointer, which came late in the first half— came with just over two minutes to go, when Moundou-Missi caught the ball along the baseline, pump-faked his defender into the air, and drove for a two-handed jam.
“It’s one thing to allow [Harvard co-captain Keith Wright]—the Player of the Year in the Ivy—to destroy you, but for a role player to come in and have a career-high on us, that’s disappointing—but our day was disappointing overall,” Lonergan said.
Moundou-Missi’s standout performance took on special meaning given that he played for current George Washington assistant coach Kevin Sutton for three years at Florida’s Montverde Academy.
“What I saw today, I was very pleased with,” Sutton said. “He continues to get better and improve.”
BIG D
Though Moundou-Missi took control offensively after the intermission, it was the Crimson’s performance on the other end of the floor that propelled it to its third win in three seasons over George Washington.
Entering Saturday boasting the nation’s sixth-ranked scoring defense, Harvard held the Colonials to a season-low 30 percent shooting from the field and 13 points in the first half.
“Their post men just manhandled us inside,” Lonergan said. “We missed some easy shots, and they made us take a lot of bad shots too, so I give them all the credit in the world.”
While it benefited from numerous missed opportunities by George Washington at the basket, the Crimson successfully clamped down the Colonials’ leading scorer, senior guard Tony Taylor, holding him to 3-of-12 field goal shooting.
He didn’t receive much help, as George Washington had 20 points in the paint to Harvard’s 36.
“Our guard play besides Tony was atrocious, and our post play was probably worse,” Lonergan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a game of runs. The Harvard women’s basketball team and Dartmouth took turns lighting up the scoreboard and shutting each other down on Saturday night at Leede Arena in Hanover, N.H.
But it was the Crimson (8-6, 1-0 Ivy) that ultimately prevailed over the Big Green (2-12, 0-1). With a season’s best shooting performance in the second half, Harvard trumped its Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth, 71-63, in its first Ivy League match of the season.
The Crimson seized control of Saturday’s game early with a 5-0 run and led the Big Green by as many as 12 less than seven minutes into play.
“We started the game really strong, and I never really like that,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “I like to start strong, but I think it can give you a false sense of security.”
Delaney-Smith’s concern was validated as Dartmouth began to chip away at the Crimson’s once-sizable 12-point cushion, going on an 18-2 run fueled by a trio of three-pointers from behind the arc.
“[The Big Green] had some young kids step up and hit some big threes, and it set us back,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think we expected it.”
Dartmouth, which entered the matchup riding a nine game losing streak and sitting at the bottom of the conference standings, finally found its stroke, outshooting Harvard 43.8 percent to 36.4 percent over the final 11 minutes of the half.
Riding its hot shooting, Dartmouth grabbed a 26-22 lead and closed out the half on top, 31-30.
“We kind of got away from [Crimson] ball at the end of the first half,” said sophomore guard Christine Clark, who finished with 17 points. “We were very stagnant and started to take forced shots.”
But just as it did in the first frame, Harvard surged past the Big Green to start the second.
A jumper from junior forward Emma Golen and a three-pointer from classmate Miriam Rutzen in the initial 53 seconds of the half put Dartmouth on its heels and gave the Crimson the 35-31 lead.
And this time, Harvard did not relinquish its advantage.
“[In the second half] we tried to minimize the amount of shots they took on defense and force [our opponents] to take bad shots and turn the ball over,” co-captain Brogan Berry said.
Under the Crimson’s added defensive pressure, the Big Green turned the ball over a total of 17 times. On the offensive head, Harvard made it rain, knocking down its first six shots of the half.
The Crimson outscored Dartmouth in the second frame, 41-32, shooting 53.8 percent from the field and 62.5 percent from behind the arc—its best second-half shooting performance this season.
“Shooting is something we always work on as a team and individually, but I think [Saturday] it was more so looking for the extra pass and looking for the best shot possible within the offense that led to such great shooting,” Clark said.
Despite Harvard’s deadly offense, the Big Green did manage to pull within striking distance. With less than a minute of play, freshman Tia Dawson snagged a rebound and converted a fast-break layup to make it a two-possession ball game, 67-62.
But it was too little too late. On the next possession, a Dartmouth foul sent Berry to the charity stripe. With 31 seconds remaining on the clock, the senior—who went eight for eight from the line Saturday—sunk both free throws and secured Harvard’s 71-63 victory.
“Our team has championship ability, so we were able to step up at the times in the game when we needed to and get the win,” Delaney-Smith said.
Berry and Clark led the Crimson with 17 points apiece, while Golen and junior guard Vitoria Lippert contributed 10 and 12 points, respectively.
The Big Green was led by freshman Milica Toskovic, who was particularly dangerous from deep Saturday night, scoring four three-pointers, and Dawson, who finished with 10 points and 11 rebounds.
Faziah Steen and Sasha Dosenko also contributed to the Dartmouth cause, putting up 20 and 15 points, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When freshmen athletes take on collegiate competition for the first time, a nervous performance is understandable.
But rookie Amanda Sobhy’s first collegiate match was nothing less than dominant, as the 2010 Junior World Champion led the top-ranked Harvard women’s squash team (8-0, 2-0 Ivy) from the No. 1 spot to a 7-2 victory over No. 3 Penn (2-1, 1-1) at the Murr Center.
Due to eligibility concerns with her participation in professional tournaments, Sobhy was required by the Ivy League to sit out for the first 30 percent of Harvard’s regular season games.  The same restrictions were placed on sophomore Ali Farag, the male 2010 Junior World Champion, who also made his debut for the men’s team on Saturday.
After watching her team begin the season undefeated without her, the Sea Cliff, N.Y.native was itching to help her team.
“It was good just to be on [the court], and I had a lot of energy to finally be able to play and be a part of the team,” Sobhy said.
The freshman took on Quaker captain junior Nabilla Ariffin, who finished the 2011 season ranked 12th in the country.  Sobhy downed Ariffin in straight games (11-5, 11-1, 11-0).
“Amanda plays squash at such a high level,” co-captain Nirasha Guruge said.  “It was great to see her wearing the Harvard clothes and representing our team today.  It made our team very happy.”
With Sobhy now in the lineup, the freshman class now boasts three members playing in the top nine.
Haley Mendez, playing at the No. 4 position, came into the match leading the team with seven wins.  But the freshman dropped her first collegiate match against junior Pia Trinkha in four games, while classmate Julianne Chu extended her unbeaten rookie season in a comfortable victory over freshman Leslie Gill at the No. 8 spot.
Megan Murray, a freshman playing outside the top nine, defeated sophomore Hyland Murphy in straight games.  Although her result did not count towards the team’s total, Murray’s performance capped a strong day for the team’s rookies.
“On and off court, [the freshmen] are awesome and have really changed the team dynamic this season,” Guruge said.
Junior Laura Gemmell, playing in the No. 2 position, took on junior All-American Rachel Goh, who finished 10th at the 2011 CSA Championship.  Gemmell dominated early, taking the first game, 11-3. Goh fought back to take the second, 12-10, but Gemmell would take over and win the next two games, improving to 4-0 on the season.
Guruge played the closest match of the day at the No. 3 spot. The senior got off to a flying start against junior Yarden Odinak, winning the first game, 11-2. But Odinak, who took 22nd at the CSA Championships last season, would fight back and win two consecutive close games to take the 2-1 lead. And the fourth game proved even tighter, as Guruge won a tiebreaker after being down match ball, prevailing 12-10.
That was as close as Odinak would get, as Guruge would take the decisive fifth game comfortably, 11-6. The victory preserved Guruge’s undefeated season, and her record now stands at 6-0.
“I think I’m a different player this year because I know my college career is coming to an end,” said Guruge about her close match. “I’ve made a lot of changes to my game … but I also think it’s important to keep your calm and stick to your basics.”
Guruge’s co-captain Cece Cortes, taking the No. 6 spot, made her season debut after returning from a hip injury.  The senior won her debut in straight games over sophomore Courtney Jones.
Also extending their unbeaten streaks were juniors Natasha Kingshott and Sarah Mumanachit. Kingshott, playing in the No. 5 position, overcame a first-game loss to junior Stephanie Vogel by taking the next three on her way to a 6-0 record.  Mumanachit, who also improved to 6-0 on the year, won in straight games against freshman Colleen Fehm.
In the No. 9 matchup, junior Eliza Calihan dropped her first game, 14-12, before coming back to tie the match at one.  But Penn sophomore Chloe Blacker would take the next two matches, handing Calihan her first loss of the season.
Saturday’s match marks the beginning of a difficult stretch for the Crimson. Harvard will continue Ivy League play on Sunday as they take on Princeton at the Murr Center, followed by Trinity the next weekend.
“Today was the first tough match of the season, but I think everyone is excited to play these games because this is what we’ve been training for all season,” Guruge said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t looking good for the Harvard women’s hockey team midway through the second period of Saturday night’s matchup with Rensselaer. The Crimson trailed by three goals and was unable to get anything past Engineers’ goalkeeper Brianna Piper.
But after struggling through the first 35 minutes of play, Harvard dominated the final 25, scoring five unanswered goals to grab a 5-3 win at Bright Hockey Center.
Sophomore Gina McDonald turned in her best performance of the year, finishing with her first hat trick of the season to lead the Crimson past the Engineers (11-5-1, 8-3-1 ECAC).
“A huge character win for us,” said Harvard coach Katey Stone, whose team also received scores from junior Jillian Dempsey and sophomore Kalley Armstrong. “Our kids just didn’t quit, and I couldn’t be prouder of them. They played with a lot of moxie. It wasn’t easy, and they just kept believing in themselves and doing what we were trying to get them to do.”
After allowing 10 shots on goal in the first period, Harvard clamped down defensively, holding RPI (5-15-4, 2-8-3) to just eight attempts in the final two periods combined.
Engineers senior Jill Vandergrift, who had her way with the Crimson defense early on, registering a goal and an assist on four shots, was held without an attempt in the final period of play.
“We definitely put a big focus on making sure that the defensemen didn’t get any shots up,” McDonald said. “We tried to limit that, so I think that probably was a major contribution to keeping their shots down.”
“Defensively, we played very well,” Stone added. “We put a ton of pressure on them, and fortunately, it paid off for us.”
While the Crimson’s defensive pressure helped keep RPI from getting good looks at the Harvard goal, the Crimson also managed to register more shots of its own. Midway through the game, Stone opted to switch Harvard’s offensive strategy. The Crimson opted for more aggressive power play formation and emphasized attacking the net in an attempt to notch goals off of rebounds.
Dempsey was the first to strike for the Crimson, beating Piper with a lefty shot that found the back of the net with 3:29 to play in the second period. McDonald followed suit 86 seconds later, scoring a power-play goal.
“It was a scrum in front of the net, McDonald said. “I just know [the puck] ended up popping out to my back door side of the net, and I ended up just being able to touch it in at the last second.”
Thanks to McDonald’s score, the Crimson went into the final intermission trailing by just one, 3-2.
“It was huge to score those goals at the end of the second period so it was a better situation going into the third period,” Stone said.
Harvard’s momentum carried over into the third, as the Crimson evened the score 7:35 into the period. This time it was Armstrong who found the net for Harvard, rebounding a missed shot from freshman Sarah Edney and then sneaking it past Piper.
McDonald gave the Crimson its first lead of the game less than two minutes later off passes from freshmen Marissa Gedman and Hillary Crowe.
“Gina McDonald had a great night tonight,” Stone said. “She just buzzsawed in the right places.”
The Engineers had one last shot at evening the score late in the third period when Gedman was sent to the penalty box for two minutes for checking. But RPI couldn’t find the back of the net, as Kathryn Schilter’s shot was blocked and Taylor Mahoney’s attempt was wide. With 3:12 to play, the Crimson was back at full strength. The Engineers pulled their goalie with 1:09 to go, but Harvard made them pay, as Hillary Crowe came up with a steal and found McDonald, who scored the empty-netter for her third goal of the game, sealing the comeback win, 5-3.
“We were pretty hungry for goals, and it was great coming back,” McDonald said.
