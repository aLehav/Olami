After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I have to stay away from human beings, because somehow I am not one.” 
These are the first words we hear from celebrity chef and restaurateur Jeremiah Tower in the new documentary about his life and career, “Jeremiah Tower: The Last Magnificent.” The film begins in present-day Mexico, as Towers walks through Aztec ruins to his Médira home. As he cooks himself a sumptuous meal of fresh octopus, he ruminates over his childhood, his college years at Harvard, and his restaurants.
The different sections of the film vary greatly in their quality. The production triumphs in its exploration of Tower’s early years and rise to fame. Tower’s childhood is shown in a nonlinear narrative that flits back and forth between the present and the past in a way that perfectly compliments Tower’s peripatetic lifestyle. Born in 1942, Tower travelled around the world with his wealthy parents, spending his early years playing in the kitchens of grand hotels and luxurious ocean liners while his parents were not paying attention. This is where he developed his love of decadence, delicious food, and extravagance. These events explain much of Tower’s elusive character and the exuberant and luxurious atmosphere that his restaurants are so famous for.
The film spends quite a bit of time on his years at Harvard College and the Graduate School of Design too, where Tower studied architecture and grew his talent for cooking through the different meals he prepared for poets and artists who passed through Cambridge, including Allen Ginsberg. Director Lydia Tenaglia paints a fantastic image of the turbulent sixties and the student riots, juxtaposing these elements with Tower’s own turbulent personal changes, such as the exploration of his sexuality.
The most exciting part of the film, however, is its coverage of Tower’s San Francisco restaurant “Stars,” which catered to the likes of Sophia Loren and The Beastie Boys. The analysis provided in the film by current celebrity chefs Mario Batali, Martha Stewart, and Anthony Bourdain is very well-thought out and interesting, particularly because Tower paved the way for their careers. The opera soundtrack, the slow-motion shots of flames, preparation of enticing dishes of lobster and caviar, and the footage of guests having a raucous time all contribute to the opulent depiction of the restaurant, making the audiences feel as though they too were there. This section captures the mix of Edwardian elegance and Old Hollywood glamor that the restaurant strove for, contributing to the film’s overall feeling of nostalgia.
The exploration of his past gives a very clear image of the man, showcasing his genius and energy. However, the film is undermined by the lackluster representation of Tower in the present day with his foray into the New York City restaurant scene. This is much less exciting than the earlier parts of the film, which up until this point has been stunning and glitzy, bringing a dignity to the profession that extends beyond what the audience now might associate with celebrity chefs. By the end, it even feels as though Tower hasn’t spent enough time on screen. The audience has heard so much about crazy antics and visions such that it might no longer care. Despite the fill of delicious shots of food, dancing celebrities, and overflowing champagne—it leaves the viewer hungry for more of the central character’s actual story.
Despite these flaws, the film is still well worth a watch for the story it tells and the way it crafts it. It is sure to make the viewer fall in love with not only Tower’s cooking, but also the man himself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson: Talk to me about turning your poetry into an actual book. What was it like to make that decision, and how did you go about choosing your poetry and your themes?
Najya A. Williams: So I’ve always been a little nervous about putting my work completely out there, because it opens you up not only to praise, but to criticism. And I knew that I had some pretty radical ideas in here. With the time that we’re living in, especially now, it can not only be very vulnerable, but very dangerous—just putting yourself out there as someone who is stepping out against society’s norms.
In the new year, January of this year, I thought, “You know what? Before 2017 is done and over with, I’m going to put this out there.” And so I went back through the poetry that I wrote over the course of high school, mostly my junior and senior year, and I just handpicked different poems that really resonated with me and other people. I wrote new poems as well, to put in here. Once I looked up from compiling, I had 30 poems, and I was like, “Oh my gosh! How did this happen? How did I, like, have 10,000 words’ worth of poetry just all compiled and ready to go?”
THC: Do you feel a social obligation to reach out to people with poetry? Or is this about making art? Is it both? Talk to me about the tension between the two.
NAW: I think it very much started as healing. That was my way to work through grief. And after a while I was like, even if I can’t be on the front lines in Missouri, in New York, in California, in Florida, in all of these different places where really high-profile cases of police brutality and racial discrimination are taking place … even if I can’t be on the front lines, it’s my responsibility to make sure that I’m getting the message across to people.
I was always told that there’s going to come a point in time, where if you work hard enough, your words will reach places that you may not ever visit. And I think that this will give me the perfect avenue to make sure that the message gets disseminated to people across the world and not just where I’m living. It’s hard because a part of me is like, this is really private, these are my thoughts, this is super vulnerable and personal. At the same time, I don’t have the privilege of just sitting and letting certain things happen—as a black woman, as a woman of color—and not speaking out about it. I think I’m doing not only a disservice to the other black women who are facing similar prejudices and discrimination but also a disservice to myself, as someone who hopes to get married someday and have kids. I’d have to explain to them “Oh, I had the opportunity to do something, but I didn’t do it.”
THC: You’re writing about some really heavy things here! How do you deal with that emotionally? Is it ever psychologically hard for you to write?
NAW: Absolutely. Most of my poems come to me very spontaneously. I don’t use prompts; I’ve only used prompts maybe once or twice, and I didn’t end up very satisfied with it. Most of my poems come to me around 11:00, 12:00 at night and I can’t sleep. Literally, even if I am dog tired, I can’t sleep until I have written it out. And then sometimes, something will happen in the media, something will happen where it hits really close to home, and I’m like, I can’t write about this right now. I can’t talk about it right now. Specifically, I wrote a poem called “Tongue” and it’s talking about my feelings after the election. I wrote it over the summer, which was at least six months after the election. I did not talk about it, I did not write about the election, I did not want to acknowledge who was in the office. I still have trouble acknowledging who’s in the office right now. I think that drawing the line between, “Yes, this can be self care,” and also recognizing that the things I’m venting about can be toxic, is the key to making sure that I’m not psychologically and emotionally burnt out by the work that I’m doing.
THC: So going back to social activism for a moment, what do you want people to do? How do we change things right now?
NAW: That’s a wonderful question. I think number one, acknowledge that there are problems that exist in this society. I think one of the biggest things that I take issue with right now is the fact that a lot of people think that we live in a post-racial society. It’s only because of who we have in office that we’re realizing, “Wait a minute. We’re not in a post-racial society!” And so many activists like myself and others have said we were never in a post-racial society.
The second thing would just be to listen, instead of coming into the space saying, “Oh, I’m just going to fix it by doing what I think would be okay”—listening to the communities that are oppressed. I would say personally, what I would ask of you is just to tap into your network. Educate others, and tell them to support organizations that are championing women’s causes, African American causes, immigrant causes. Think of all the people you know and then tell them, and then they think of all the people they know and tell them—you can imagine it keeps going. The small impact that you made directly can blossom into something monumental.
It could also be being on the front lines, holding a picket sign, or holding a banner in front of a march and saying, “I stand in solidarity.” Or staging a protest—or you know, it doesn’t even have to be as radical as that. It could be writing an op-ed about what you think. There are a lot of different things that can be done, there’s a lot of things that you can do specifically, and that readers can do specifically on this campus. Anyone in the world—anyone who doesn’t necessarily identify as a member of an oppressed community—can do a lot of different things, whether it’s tapping into their network, or putting in their time and money and resources. Or any mixture of the above!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the iconic features of Harvard’s education is the liberal arts system. The underlying idea is to expose students to a wide variety of types of thinking. In contrast to this age-old academic idea is “innovation,” which seems to be the new buzzword for college campuses and young people. Although these two ideas sit at opposite ends of the timeline, they are inherently and necessarily intertwined.
Many times when we think of innovation in a particular field, we recall the fundamental advancements that drove the whole field forward. There are many examples of this phenomenon: the silicon-based transistor revolutionized the whole computer industry, the impressionist technique of art opened a new way to experience paintings. However, if we look at the truly great innovations of humankind, such as the wheel, writing, and democracy, these innovations have a different flavor. They don’t fit into any existing category―they force a whole new one to be defined.
In today’s world, one of the ways this can be achieved is by examining the intersection of otherwise unrelated fields. The liberal arts lend themselves to this exact approach, as students are exposed to many different subject areas that they can then mix together. Liberal arts are like a palette of primary colors, from which an infinite number of new colors can be mixed.
A classic story of this is Mark E. Zuckerberg and his creation of Facebook. During his time at Harvard, Zuckerberg, a former member of the Class of 2006, took classes in both Computer Science and Psychology. He noticed the concept of a “social network” in his psychology class and combined it with the idea of a “graph” in computer science. And so was born of one of the great tech companies of our generation.
This concept applies to ideas both big and small. Last year, the Harvard Graduate School of Education Innovation and Ventures in Education group hosted its second annual hackathon. Many of the ideas that came out of the event focused on using technology to help solve educational needs―matching high school students to colleges, building tools for the identification of learning disorders, and more. These new and innovative ideas came to be through the combination of concepts from technology, education, psychology, and other fields.
It is pretty obvious from these examples that fields in the humanities and social sciences can lead to new technologies. But can it work the other way?
One of the more popular ideas floating around technology innovation centers like Silicon Valley is “Design Thinking”, or designing products through user empathy. The process consists of identifying user needs, ideating and creating solutions that solve them, and then getting feedback to refine it. For example, at Airbnb, every new employee had to actually use the service within their first week, and based on their experience, identify problems in the service. They would then build new features to help fix these problems, get feedback from users, and change the feature if it was not the most effective.
It turns out that we can apply this same methodology to essay writing. For example, when we revise an essay, we first get the user to test the product, provide feedback, and then reiterate the product to make it a better experience for the user. We keep going through this cycle until the essay satisfies and delights the reader. Great essays can be written by following this process, informed through technology design.
The next wave of great innovations that will push humankind forward is going to be found through a mindset of innovation through the liberal arts. It seems Harvard is committed to following through on this idea. The Harvard Innovation Lab provides resources for students to collaborate on ventures across schools and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’ mission statement notes, “To address current and future societal challenges, knowledge from fundamental science, art, and the humanities must all be linked through the application of engineering principles with the professions of law, medicine, public policy, design and business practice.”
These cross-field collaborations are what will ultimately help the University fulfill its mission―preparing students to be citizen-leaders of the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, the Cambridge Historical Commission announced it would be recommending that the Harvard Square Kiosk, currently home to Out of Town News, be designated as an official historic landmark. This would grant it protection as the City of Cambridge plans to implement a multi-million dollar renovation of the Square plaza. Currently, the renovations include a complete overhaul of the kiosk that would include a glass and LED exterior, a drastic change from the red brick and metal that currently characterize it. We strongly support the Commission’s recommendations, as we hope it will remind not only Cantabrigians, but Harvard students as well, of the kiosk’s history.
The kiosk, which  has been standing since 1928 and was once the former entrance to the T, is not considerably old in comparison to other Harvard buildings. However, designating the kiosk as a historical landmark would go a long way towards fostering a greater sense of history and appreciation in Harvard Square, and that is something all Square denizens would benefit from.
We appreciate the upswell of support for protecting the kiosk from across the community. Five Harvard professors have endorsed the designation as well as the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association. In response, the City of Cambridge has created the Harvard Square Kiosk and Plaza Working Group.
The sheer number of committees and groups comprised of volunteers and Cambridge residents makes this issue a prime example of the responsiveness of local politics. This should remind students that we temporarily share Cambridge for four years with many local communities and residents; it is important that we be in touch with a variety of local political issues, especially if we choose to vote here or become politically engaged. The interests of Harvard and its students are very narrow, and all of us in the University community must be informed and aware of the many issues facing Cambridge.
While the historical designation might save the kiosk from a potentially existential threat, the character of Harvard Square faces many more. As we have repeatedly opined in the past, Harvard Square is becoming increasingly inaccessible to Harvard students. There is no end to the amount of high-end clothing and goods stores that have popped up around campus, many with hardly any students inside. “Bougie” restaurants, cafés, and eateries all command high prices, pander to students’ poor money-spending habits, and bar many others from being able to join their peers for an off-campus meal. It is a pressing issue that the City, the Harvard community, and especially the businesses that occupy Harvard Square must consider.
We hope Harvard Square becomes a more welcoming place in future. The City Council will likely vote on the kiosk’s designation later this week, and we urge them to accept the Historical Commission’s recommendation. Let’s add another piece of history to Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About two weeks ago, I found myself driving back to Harvard from morning PT (physical training) at MIT. Exhausted, I drove past the Zipcar return point, only to realize that I had no legal means for making a U-turn without adding 5-10 minutes to my commute. The time was 0830; I feared arriving late to my 0900 Russian class, and I had no intention of incurring the wrath of my Russian instructor. Moreover, I disliked wearing my sweaty PT uniform to class, as the uniform simultaneously smelled and drew unwanted attention. As such, I was determined to return to Mather with enough time for a quick pre-Russian shower. Thus, I braved Mass. Ave., and—through a series of illegal maneuvers—attempted to slide the car back into its designated parking spot.
My passenger—a fellow grizzled cadet—yelled various creative obscenities as I dangerously approached the Zipcar parking spot. Smiling, I turned to him and threatened to drive the car into a street light, but at such an angle that only I would die, leaving him to inherit my responsibilities, as well as my smelly carcass. After a few seconds of silence, we erupted in laughter. I completed my dangerous maneuver, exited the car, and asked him if, perhaps, we had laughed too hard at my dark joke. His only complaint was that I didn’t materialize my threat. We stared at each other for a brief second, erupted in laughter yet again, drank some coffee, and went our separate ways.
The aforementioned interaction, though disturbing to some, was an honest one. Neither I nor my friend concealed our stress; instead, we opted to mock it. Unfortunately, most of us spend our lives shrouding our misery behind polite mannerisms, the oddest of which is the habitual “how are you” and its corresponding partner: “I’m fine, how about you?” The strangest part of this boring ritual is how we continue to walk past each other as we answer, already knowing that our acquaintance’s reply will prove too short to merit a full conversation. I try my best to avoid this annoying exchange by simply raising my eyebrows or politely nodding as I pass those I know. However, even this attempt to stave off “how are you” proves somewhat dehumanizing; names become a series of nods, and before I know it, every interaction becomes rehearsed.
The truth is, we’re all a bit on edge. Additionally, few people genuinely care about how we’re doing; we’re all unhealthily obsessed with our own affairs, viewing ourselves as the sole protagonists of our own odysseys. As a friend of mine explained, “everyone else is an NPC (a non-playable character) in life’s game.” Moreover, we’re habitual liars, satisfied with reciting and receiving the same reply, day in and day out: “I’m fine.” This response helps stave off the guilt of not making time for friends, for family, and for those we love. After all, everyone’s doing just fine.
But we know the truth; we simply choose not to share it. We lack the time to challenge our own demons, let alone those of friends and strangers. To answer each “how are you” honestly would take an eternity; thus, we’re stuck maintaining the polite illusion of peace.
However, this illusion is overrated and well worth disrupting. Sure, we may lack the time to engage in meaningful conversations, but a quick dark joke can help lighten the mood. I’m not advocating this strategy with strangers or unfamiliar acquaintances; with them, you’ve got to maintain the illusion of peace. But amongst close friends, self-deprecating, cynical, dark humor—the language of the morbidly joyful—provides the perfect disruption. Nothing empowers you more than laughing at the seemingly serious. To make a mockery of stress is to seize the reins of your life once more. I can’t control half my schedule, the attitude of those around me, life’s banalities, or the policies dictating my terms of service. But I can certainly laugh at it all.
As I enter the Barker Center, I’m greeted by a friend. “How are you?” he asks. “I was doing just fine, but then I remembered that you’re somehow part of my life,” I answer. “F*** off,” he replies, and we see each other off with sadistic smiles. We may not feel fine, but for a moment, we’re happy as we briefly shatter the false peace. I waltz into Russian class just before 0907, still stuck in my sweaty uniform; my daring illegal U-turn had failed to grant me enough time to shower and change.
I open my textbook to page 48, where I’m greeted by the Russian word for “hopeless” in bold typeface. I chuckle, and my Russian teacher throws me a look of concern. For a moment, I contemplate telling her the truth: that I find the word “hopeless” funny, that I find entertainment in life’s small, meaningless ironic miseries. I open my mouth, only to mutter “ничего,” the Russian word for “nothing.” As she turns to face the blackboard, I silently laugh in my head; sometimes dark humor is best enjoyed alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As temperatures dip and vibrant leaves blanket Harvard Yard, students have begun a series of annual autumn traditions.
On campus and across New England, students are picking apples, carving pumpkins, and quaffing hot cider to get into the fall spirit.
One such student, Alec S. DeCaprio ’21, celebrated the arrival of autumn by embarking on an apple-picking excursion with a group of friends.
“Recently, I went apple-picking in the middle of the state, a little more west. We actually brought back a lot of the product here, so I have a lot of donuts in my room, apple ciders in my fridge,” he said.
The House Committees of several upperclassmen houses have also organized fall-themed activities to mark the season.
On Monday, Mather held a new celebration, “Fall Fest,” which included “pumpkin painting and bobbing for apples, make-your-own caramel apple station, [and] apple cider donuts,” according to Mather HoCo Co-Chair Lenny C. Murphy Jr. ’18. The group is also adding “fall-themed” happy hour events.
Winthrop’s HoCo and Faculty Deans collaborated on a harvest-themed event this past weekend, said Winthrop HoCo Co-Chair Danielle O. Strasburger ’18. About 30 Winthrop students traveled to Shelburne Farm in Stow, Mass., to pick apples, amble through pumpkin patches, and take an old-fashioned hayride. They later put their pickings to use by baking pies.
The following day, Winthrop residents resurrected an old annual tradition called “Throptoberfest,” a party featuring pumpkin decorating, apple cider donuts, and fall-themed beers and ciders amidst a festive setting of hay bales and corn stalks.
Dunster is planning a “Fall Hoedown,” featuring traditional fall foods and folk music. Dunster Faculty Dean Cheryl Chen is also planning to traveling with students to Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Mass. for apple-picking this weekend.
“It’s so beautiful around here in the fall, and it’s just a nice way to get people off campus,” Chen said. She added that later this month the Faculty Dean’s open house “will be an apple-themed event,” possibly offering freshly baked apple crisp.
Other organizations on campus are also taking advantage of fall foliage and weather in an effort to escape the frenetic pace of college life. In addition to their regular hikes throughout New England, the Harvard Outing Club has organized multiple fall-themed trips.
“We ran a trip to the farm last weekend mixed with Food Literacy,” said Cameron J. Maltman ’20, Gear Manager for the club.
For students coming to Harvard from outside New England, fall activities can provide a new cultural experience.
“I’m from Texas originally,” said Strasburger, “so I think just the fact that it’s a season that’s celebrated is fun, since that’s not really my background.”
This month’s fall festivities follow weeks of unseasonably warm temperatures. According to climate data from the Northeast Regional Climate Center, this September marked the third-warmest on record for Southern New England, and a warm spell at the end of the month broke several daily high temperature records.
“We’re setting many more high temperature records than low temperature records,” said Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Peter Huybers, noting that an increase in average temperatures makes unusually warm temperatures more likely.
“In some ways, I love this. Fall is my favorite season,” said Huybers.
DeCaprio, though, noticed a distinct shift in the weather Thursday.
“Today was really the first day where the air was very crisp, and I think that’s a trademark of New England, very crisp air. It’s not offensive to your lungs,” DeCaprio said. “It really draws me into this New England aesthetic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of friends, family members, and colleagues of Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. celebrated his lifetime of legal work at an event announcing a professorship endowed in his honor earlier this month.
Law School professor David B. Wilkins said the idea of endowing a Law School professorship in Ogletree’s honor came about during a discussion between some of Ogletree’s good friends, including Harvard Corporation members Kenneth I. Chenault and Ted V. Wells.
“I suggested that of all the things that we could do, endowing a chair to ensure that Harvard Law School would always have somebody who focused on the key issues that Charles Ogletree cared so deeply about — so issues of race and criminal justice...would be something that would be a lasting tribute,” Wilkins said
Ogletree, who has been a professor at Harvard since 1985, founded both the Criminal Justice Institute at the Law School and the Charles Hamilton Houston Center Institute for Racial Justice. He received his legal education at the Law School as well, serving as the national president of the Black Law Students Association. After Law School, he worked at the Washington, D.C. Public Defender’s Office.
Wilkins said Ogletree was a prolific lawyer before becoming a professor.
“Ogletree was a superstar as a lawyer,” Wilkins said. “He was one of the best public defenders, meaning one of the people who represent poor people in criminal cases, in the history of the Washington, D.C. Public Defender's Office, which is probably without question the best public defenders office in the world.”
Tomiko Brown-Nagin, a Law School professor and the current faculty director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute, also emphasized Ogletree's work regarding sexual harassment. She lauded his work representing Anita Hill, who accused Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991.
“He also helped raise consciousness about the sexual harassment of working women—an enduring issue for women across a range of industries—through his representation of Professor Anita Hill,” Brown Nagin wrote in an email.
Ogletree, known to his close friends as “Tree,” announced last year that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease. He is currently on leave from the Law School and was unavailable for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 175 Harvard Law School students and alumni penned an open letter to Law School Dean John F. Manning Wednesday asking the school to improve a program meant to provide financial stability to alumni who pursue careers in public service.
The Low Income Protection Plan, which the letter claims falls short of similar programs at peer institutions like Yale and Stanford, obligates students to pay a portion of their income each year toward their law school debt, while the Law School commits to covering the remainder.
Programs at various schools differ in the percentage of monthly loan payments alumni must cover themselves, as well as what kind of jobs are considered public service employment.
Madison E. Condon, who helped draft the letter, said the Law School emphasized the superiority of their program to those of peer institutions when she was a prospective student.
“I remember I talked to a lot of the administration at the time when I was considered which school to go to, and I feel like they convinced me,” Condon said. “They really build their program as the best of their peer institutions, and they did it in a really convincing way.”
Nicole A. Summers, who wrote and solicited signatures for the letter, said that speaking to students from other law schools about their repayment plans made her feel worse off about Harvard’s program.
“HLS has fallen behind its peer schools in terms of supporting alums who go into public interest. I feel like the loan repayment levels that HLS requires are quite high,” Summers said. “That was not what I was expecting, given the way that HLS promoted LIPP when I was an incoming student and while I was a current student considering going into public interest.”
Kenneth Lafler, the school’s Assistant Dean for Student Financial Services, wrote in a statement that the school has been in contact with some of the students who signed the letter over the past year to discuss their thoughts about LIPP. He said that many students benefit from the flexibility of Harvard’s program.
“There are many career-path scenarios in which LIPP participants fare much better than they would under programs offered elsewhere. LIPP’s advantage is that it accommodates the kinds of job changes that young lawyers frequently make, and it doesn’t penalize them for changing jobs,” Lafler wrote.
According to Lafler, Harvard Law School alumni can qualify for LIPP while working in a wide range of jobs.
“No loan repayment assistance program can justifiably make the claim to provide the highest benefit in every case. LIPP strikes a balance between generosity and flexibility, and avoids the financial risks that participation in other programs often entails,” he wrote.
Alexa Shabecoff, the school’s Assistant Dean for Public Service, wrote in a statement that LIPP’s growing enrollment numbers proves its popularity.
“LIPP's steadily growing enrollment, and the diverse and interesting career paths of those who participate in it, show that the program is supporting its participants,” Shabecoff wrote. “I am always eager to hear suggestions for making this great program even greater, and I look forward to exploring with our wonderful alumni how we can do so together.”

At first, Emily M. Lu ’21 thought the text message she received from her dad on Monday morning was a joke: It said that their house in Santa Rosa, Calif. had burned down.
“You don’t expect something like that to just happen overnight,” Lu said.
Lu is one of thousands of Californians—and dozens of Harvard students—affected by the wildfires currently scouring the northern part of the state. Flames started tearing through Mendocino, Napa, and Sonoma Counties on Monday, killing several, injuring dozens, destroying countless structures, and ravaging more than 120,000 acres of land in one of the biggest wildfires in California’s history.
“I am born and raised in the heart of Santa Rosa. That’s the place I love more than anything, and the place I’ve probably been the most affected by,” said Cesar J. Farias Jr. ’19.
Now, most of his hometown has been reduced to ash, he said. “It’s something you can’t really understand until something this catastrophic happens to you, your family, and your community.”
The fires began in the middle of the night and have continued burning for days; they are currently only minimally contained.
Fortunately, many residents were able to evacuate their homes by car, bus, and on foot. Many had just enough time to get out and grab a only few belongings.
Isabelle Mieling, a School of Public Health student from Sonoma, Calif., said her family was lucky: They were given enough time for her mother to gather the “documents hardest to replace.”
But now, widespread power outages in the region have made it difficult for students to get in touch with their displaced family members. “Everyone’s reaching out, and Napa has lost power and cell service, so people were posting about family members they were trying to reach. It’s been really hard to think about anything else,” Mieling said.
Lu said she’s received support from proctors, Peer Advising Fellows, and administrators. “The day after I told my proctor that my house burned down, she told the Dean, and they were like, ‘hey, we’ll help you out,” she said.
Laurel R. McCaull ’18, a Sonoma County native, started a GoFundMe to support shelters and relief centers in Northern California, which has so far raised over $4,000.
Despite the devastation, Farias said he’s holding onto hope.
“It’s a tough place with resilient people that come together no matter what background,” he said. “If anyone was to make the best out of the situation and attack it head on, it would be my community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On her most recent trips to Washington, University President Drew G. Faust has added yet another pressing, albeit more quotidian, item to her lobbying agenda: keeping the lights on in Harvard’s labs.
President Donald Trump’s 2018 budget would decrease funding for the National Institutes of Health by $5.8 billion, cutting largely from a category of funds called “Facilities and Administrative costs.” These “indirect costs” include lighting and heating within research facilities at universities around the country—one part of the federal government’s effort to bankroll research at American institutions.
Harvard received around $600 million in federal research funds in 2016, and approximately a third of that goes toward indirect costs, according to Faust.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that losses to indirect funding could pose a real challenge for the FAS, Harvard’s flagship faculty.
“We’re bringing in quite a bit of money through federal contracts which provide money for a lot of buildings and other infrastructure that makes possible what we do going forward,” he said. “So if that was to all go away, we’d have to sit down and look at that.”
University administrators across the country, including Faust, are pushing back on the Trump budget, arguing that this money is essential to keeping buildings open and operations going. Faust said she is lobbying members of Congress, who are charged with passing the final budget, to preserve the funds.
“I’ve been in contact with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, who’ve been very responsive and very active in pushing back against this,” she said. “So we’re feeling good about where this is at the moment, thanks to the leadership of a number of members of the Republican party in alliance with Democrats on this."
Faust met with Vice President Mike Pence at the White House over the summer. She has also met with Congressman Tom Cole, chair of the House Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Senator Roy Blunt, who chairs the Subcommittee on the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
Those efforts seem to bearing fruit. In September, the House passed the Labor/Health and Human Services/Education funding bill with a provision to safeguard indirect costs, and the equivalent Senate bill has now passed through the appropriations committee. The two chambers will have to reconcile their versions of the legislation, and Trump will have to sign the final version before money is shelled out for this fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. Congress passed a spending bill to keep the government running through December to buy time.
Smith said that there is not an easy solution if the University loses large amounts of indirect funding. FAS is already struggling with the financial implications of “disappointing” endowment returns and has taken on debt to fund its House renewal project. To Smith, though, maintaining “excellence” is more important than a balanced budget.
“I personally believe it’s much harder to rebuild excellence in an intellectual area than it is to take a couple years and have some financial ups and downs, as long as it doesn’t last for 25  years,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College hopes to name a new associate dean of students by the spring and fill a final vacancy in the senior ranks of the Office of Student Life.
The next associate dean of students will be tasked with managing all aspects of residential life for the over 5,000 upperclassmen in the College. The associate dean will also develop the training program for the 350 tutors that live in the upperclassman Houses and interface with several other University departments.
Additionally, the associate dean of students oversees the summer residential program, supports House Renewal planning, and serves as a member of several committees of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote that the job posting for the associate dean of students has been “disseminated widely” and that students will participate in the search process. O’Dair and Sheila C. Thimba, the College’s dean for administration and finance, will co-chair the search committee.
 David R. Friedrich, the former associate dean of students, departed the role in July for MIT. Friedrich played a significant role preparing to implement the College’s policies targeting unrecognized single gender social organizations. Following the announcement of the sanctions, he co-moderated a town hall event at which he faced a harsh round of questioning from students about the proposed penalties.
He frequently met with undergraduate leaders of final clubs and Greek organizations, and served as a staff member to the faculty committee that ultimately recommended banning single-gender social groups altogether, among other options.
The OSL has faced significant turnover in recent years as administrators have, sometimes abruptly, left senior posts within the College’s primary office overseeing residential life, student organizations, and diversity and inclusion initiatives.
O’Dair arrived in August 2016 to take the helm of the OSL, and the office brought on another administrator overseeing campus clubs in June 2016. The College also appointed a new associate dean for diversity and inclusion, who began working at Harvard last week.

As members of Harvard’s highest governing boards scour the globe for her replacement, outgoing University President Drew G. Faust said she will largely stay out of the process.
“I think it’s very important that I not be involved in the search process because this is to be another administration, another regime,” she said. “I’ve had my wonderful experience and it’s now in the hands of the Fellows and the search committee.”
The search committee, composed of all 12 members of the Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers, has spent the last few months soliciting input from Harvard affiliates about the qualities they would like to see in the next president. The group also appointed faculty, staff, and student advisory committees to provide guidance.
While Faust said she is “happy to answer” questions about what the job requires, she emphasized in an interview in September  that she is “not part of the search.”
But past presidents have not always taken quite so passive an approach. Former University President Derek C. Bok who led Harvard from 1971 to 1991 and again in 2006 in an interim capacity, said prior search committees have consulted him in every search since he left office—including two while he was the acting president. Bok provided input in the search for his successor, Neil L. Rudenstine, in his role as an ex-officio member of the Corporation.
“I was actually a member of the Corporation since the search was conducted during my last year of office, so I was pretty much aware of everything that the Corporation was doing to carry out the search,” Bok said in a recent interview.
He also weighed in on the most recent search, which culminated in Faust’s selection. At the time, Bok was serving as interim president after Lawrence H. Summers resigned the post amid controversy.
“I was interviewed and I think then I was asked about candidates, and I was also asked about what the University needed, or whether I had any ideas about the kind of person who ought to be appointed,” Bok said of the 2006-2007 search.
Bok said he has spoken to one Corporation member about the current search.
“In this early stage, the conversation was very general, not about specific individuals—I wouldn’t be much help with that anyway, since I’ve pretty much kept out of Harvard affairs for quite some time,” he said. “But [the Corporation member] talked to me about what kind of person the University ought to be looking for, what the University needs at this particular time.”
Bok declined to comment about the substance of his responses. Rudenstine did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several members of the Undergraduate Council criticized UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 for her remarks opposing a ban on single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations at last week’s Faculty meeting, contending that her views did not reflect those of the entire UC.
At the Faculty meeting on Oct. 3, Sachee urged professors to vote against any proposals that would enforce an outright ban on social groups. “It would be imprudent to pretend that their elimination would solve the current problem,” Sachee, a member of the Bee Club, said. “Students must be allowed to make choices, as they have been thus far.”
 Her remarks came amid discussion of a faculty committee proposal to ban membership in unrecognized single-gender social groups. University President Drew G. Faust will decide whether or not to pursue that path.
At Monday’s UC general meeting, though, several representatives said they were frustrated that they were not consulted about Sachee’s remarks.
Among them was UC representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19, who introduced legislation to prevent the UC president and vice president from sending official campus-wide emails that would ask undergraduates to take a particular action, like filling out a survey. The proposal did not pass because it failed to garner a two-thirds vote.
Bonsall said his amendment was spurred by his concerns over transparency issues between the UC executive committee and the other Council members.
“The main reason why we introduced this legislation was to start a conversation on the UC about how the UC functions, and about whether the way it currently functions is the most fair and democratic,” Bonsall said. “I, personally, and many other members of the Council who I talked to, are frustrated that we were not consulted at all before that statement was made.”
In an interview Thursday, Sachee said that she has done her best to be as transparent as possible in communication with other UC members and that she intends to keep that as a priority for the rest of her tenure.
Wyatt M. Robertson ’18, a UC member who voted against the email restriction, expressed his personal confidence in Sachee and Khansarinia. He said that the pair’s selection by the student body gives them the “right” to express opinions on undergraduates’ behalf.
“That’s what they’re supposed to do. That’s what they were voted to do,” Robertson said. “One of the advantages of having a president and vice president that can send these kinds of emails is that they can react and respond quickly to things.”
But Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said he was concerned about the ability of the UC president and vice president to communicate quickly with the entire student body: “The president and vice president have so much power,” said Whittaker, who supported the email restriction.
Whittaker said that while a “separation of powers” exists between UC representatives and the UC president and vice president, he said he thinks that not all students are represented in discussions about the sanctions on off-campus social groups.
On Thursday, Sachee reiterated her opposition to a ban on unrecognized single gender social organizations.
“I don’t believe that a ban on social organizations would be good for student life at the College,” Sachee said. “I will come back to the Faculty, and hope to be able to have the opportunity to present what the student opinion believes, with regards to the different options that were presented.”
Sachee acknowledged that students have differing perspectives on the social club penalties, and she plans on releasing more information in the “coming days” about how the UC will solicit student opinions.
Robertson said that he supported Sachee’s address at the Faculty meeting because it elevates the voice of students to Faculty members.
“It shows we do have a stake in it, we do have opinions, and we want to be heard,” Robertson said. “It set the precedent for people to actually now listen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists at the Kennedy School described the potential impact of “green banks,” institutions which seek to finance renewable energy initiatives, at an event Thursday.
Moderated by Asia Energy and Sustainability Initiative Director Edward Cunningham, the talk focused on expanding methods of funding renewable energy in New England. The panel featured a green bank director, a state legislator, the head of a non-profit that advocates for green investing, and the director of an energy consulting firm.
Massachusetts State Representative Paul W. Mark said green banks have the potential to introduce clean energy into a new market profitably.
“I think that’ll be the takeaway: that it can work, it’s been shown to work, and it’s worth the investment,” said Mark.
Bryan Garcia, the executive director of the Connecticut Green Bank, said that because green banks involve collaboration between public and private actors, success depends on developing strong partnerships with government officials.
“I think it comes down to people… trying to find awesome public servants who are willing to commit their time and be very mission-driven to something they know is outside of them… It’s a ‘Thank God it’s Monday’ kind of attitude,” said Garcia, whose organization won the 2017 Innovations in American Government Awards.
Cunningham also pointed out that green banks could require a significant time investment, just as solar energy took many years to become integrated into the economy. However, speakers said green banks would be worth the gains in energy efficiency in the long run.
“It was only because of massive investments by a lot of governments, Germany and Spain and China—that was the only reason why solar became commercially valuable technology,” Carter Wall, the managing director of consulting firm Franklin Beach Energy, said.
Both Garcia and Jeffrey Schub, the executive director of nonprofit Coalition for Green Capital, said green banks are limited by consumer demand. Unfortunately, Schub said, renewable energy sources do not have the same mass appeal as the iPhone he waited in a long line to buy.
“I think the role of government and policymakers here [in] some ways needs to change to be more about how to enable people to really want it,” said Schub.
While green banks involve large private and public entities, Mark said individuals can have an impact on creating a greener society as well through grassroots advocacy.
“For a cleaner environment at the government level, it’s important that you stay in touch with the people who are elected to represent you,” Mark said. “Let them know that this is policy that’s important to me, I care about the future.”

Mark your calendars, Friday the 13th is fast approaching! While most people will probably use this day to hit up their regular party spots and traverse to neighboring colleges for a good time (or mediocre at best), why not mix it up and do something special? Whether you’re aloof, spooky, or even freaky, here are a few activities to keep in mind for the 13th.
Scare your friends with pranks: If you’re feeling a bit naughty on the night, pull a few pranks on your friends. Steal all your rower roommate’s Chubbies so he’ll stop showing off his quads. Or, rave about the nonexistent caviar that Annenberg is serving for dinner, and watch familiar disappointment slide onto your peers’ faces once they realize there’s nothing but the regular schlop.
Watch a horror movie: Gather some friends, turn off the lights, and prepare for some Amazon Prime and spooky time! Stream some of horror classics, such as Insidious, The Shining, The Exorcist, and (of course) Friday the 13th. Or, if you’re into more recent stuff, binge the new season of American Horror Story, “Cult.” Call a friend with a projector or HDMI cord for the full effect.
City-wide manhunt: Maybe Friday the 13th gets you all jazzed up. Host a manhunt game in the Cambridge area, and spend the night chasing down your inebriated buddies while screaming at other pedestrians that you go to Harvard. Loser has to jump into the Charles River.
Study at Cabot: Are you the type of person who likes to get scared all on your own? If so, swing by Cabot library in the evening and gaze around the ghostly empty room, since you’re the one loser who decided to stay in on the night of Friday the 13th.
Get psychotic in the bathroom: If all else fails, try out some Bloody Mary chants, fully clothed showers in the dark, and “bloody” mirror writing if you’re hardcore. (Red)rum anyone? Get creative, and try to spook out your roommate or the next person to use the hall bathroom that night.
Happy hauntings, Harvard!
