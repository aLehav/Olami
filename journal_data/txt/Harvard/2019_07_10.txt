After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard has dismissed head fencing coach Peter Brand after an independent inquiry into the 2016 sale of his home found he violated Harvard’s conflict of interest policy, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an email to athletics staff Tuesday.
“Harvard Athletics is committed to upholding the integrity of our athletics program, and it is our expectation that every coach and staff member adhere unambiguously to our policies,” Scalise wrote in a statement Tuesday.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced the investigation in April, after the Boston Globe reported that Brand sold his Needham, Mass. home to Jie Zhao — the father of two current and former Harvard fencers — for well over its assessed market value.
One of Zhao’s two sons — a rising junior at the College — was admitted to Harvard shortly following his father’s purchase of Brand’s home. Zhao’s other son graduated from the College in 2018.
Brand and other Harvard coaches are required to annually agree to the University’s conflict of interest policy. The University also provided coaches with additional conflict of interest training following its announcement of the investigation into Brand.
“A conflict of interest exists when individual commitment to the University may be compromised by personal benefit,” an Athletics income disclosure form reads. “Employees are expected to avoid situations or activities that could interfere with their unencumbered exercise of judgment in the best interests of Harvard University.”
Brand could not immediately be reached for a request for comment.
Separately, a federal grand jury is also investigating Brand’s sale of his house to Zhao. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric S. Rosen’s office subpoenaed the Needham Board of Assessors in April for documents related to the valuation of Brand’s home. Grand jury proceedings occur in secret, leaving the status of the investigation uncertain.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the details of the independent review and the grand jury probe. Scalise wrote in his email to staff Tuesday that the Athletics Department will conduct a “national search” to replace Brand and that he expects to fill the head coach position by the early fall.
The shakeup in the Athletics Department comes in the wake of a separate federal investigation into a national college admissions scandal that involved charges against 50 people for bribery and racketeering. In that case, six Harvard alumni were among the celebrities and college coaches accused of defrauding admissions offices of elite colleges and universities throughout the country. Current Harvard faculty, staff, and students were not directly implicated in that case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrea “Andi” Wright and Charles “Chip” E. Lockwood will serve as the new resident deans of Eliot House and Adams House, respectively, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced to Harvard College staff in a Tuesday email.
Resident deans act as the principal link between undergraduates and College administrators. Among other duties, they serve as students’ academic advisers, represent students before disciplinary bodies like the Honor Council and the Administrative Board, and fulfill various administrative responsibilities.
“I encourage each of you to reach out to our new Allston Burr Resident Deans to welcome them to this great community,” O’Dair wrote.
While completing his Ph.D. program in religion at Harvard, Lockwood was a resident tutor in Adams for six years until 2015. He taught as a lecturer for the Committee on the Study of Religion at Harvard and served as its assistant director of undergraduate studies, O’Dair wrote. Lockwood will succeed Adam Muri-Rosenthal in the Adams resident deanship, which Muri-Rosenthal held for five years.
Adams House Faculty Dean Judith S. Palfrey wrote in an email Tuesday that Lockwood “combines all of the attributes of a great [resident dean].”
“He is a distinguished scholar, a caring counselor and a community builder,” Palfrey wrote. “We are really looking forward to having Chip, his wife Meg and son Charlie returning to Adams.”
Wright earned her Ph.D. in anthropology at Brown University. She also coordinated programs at Brown’s Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender and served as a mentor for first-generation and low-income graduate students, according to O’Dair’s email. Wright will be taking over the deanship from Katy Leonard, who held the position for the past two years.
Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe wrote in an email Tuesday that she and her co-Faculty Dean Douglas Melton are “delighted” that Wright will be joining the House.
“Her previous experience is well suited to the role of [resident dean], and our interviews with her this spring convinced us that her attitude and enthusiasm would perfectly suit our House,” O’Keefe wrote.
Lockwood and Wright did not respond to a request for comment.
Though resident deans act as half-time faculty members, conducting classes and giving lectures, their duties have grown increasingly administrative in the past few decades. The role drew controversy in 2013 when then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds conducted secret searches of resident deans’ email accounts.
In 2014, former Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister approved a number of changes to the resident dean position. The administrators were renamed Allston Burr House deans, required to have earned a Ph.D., and were formally relieved of teaching responsibilities during their first semester in the role.
In December 2017, O’Dair changed resident deans’ title back to “Allston Burr Resident Deans” — marking the fourth time administrators revised the title in over a decade. The decision to revert to an older title reflected widespread confusion about the previous title of “Allston Burr Assistant Dean,” O’Dair said at the time.
Lockwood and Wright’s terms officially took effect on July 1, according to College spokesperson Aaron Goldman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 11, 2019 at 6:17 a.m.
Economics professor Roland G. Fryer, Jr. has been placed on a two-year administrative leave effective immediately after Harvard found he violated University sexual harassment policies, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to Economics department members Wednesday.
The sanctions come more than a year after one of Fryer’s former employees at EdLabs — the research group he headed — first filed a formal Title IX complaint with the Office for Dispute Resolution, the group that investigates Title IX complaints on campus. Two other Title IX investigations and a probe into Fryer’s finances soon followed. One former employee also filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination but later withdrew her complaint.
The Title IX complainants alleged Fryer engaged in unwelcome sexual conduct stretching back years and that he created a hostile environment for women at the EdLabs. Fryer, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story, has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Gay announced in her email that EdLabs will permanently close and that she has placed Fryer on administrative leave. During the two-year leave, Fryer will not be able to teach, supervise, or conduct research using the University’s resources.
If Fryer returns to Harvard in 2021, he will spend the following two years unable to advise or supervise students, and will teach undergraduate classes “subject to monitoring by a Title IX-trained individual.” Fryer will not have access to graduate student teaching fellows and he will not be able to teach graduate workshops, Gay wrote in her email.
Gay wrote that ODR investigators found Fryer “engaged in unwelcome conduct,” created a hostile work environment, and committed other violations of the FAS professional conduct policy that were not sexual in nature. She added that she believes Fryer’s conduct represented a “betrayal of the trust” of the FAS community.
“I was particularly upset to learn of the ways in which EdLabs members have been impacted, both personally and professionally,” Gay wrote. “The totality of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of the trust of the FAS community.”
After the two-year leave and two years of supervised teaching, Gay will decide whether to restore Fryer the privileges she took away Wednesday.
