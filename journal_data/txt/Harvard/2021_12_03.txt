After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I cannot cook.
My wonderful roommates that I lived off-campus with in the spring of 2021 can attest to this. Dinner time would roll around, and there I would be, patiently sitting at our rickety kitchen table, embarrassingly waiting for one of them to begin the daily meal preparation while I offered encouragement from the sidelines. Literally — I would stand to the right of my roommate Eleanor (a fellow Crimson Editorial editor) as she cooked at the stove, pestering her on the daily.
The necessity of cooking had never once entered my mind in high school, and for good reason (or at least, what I believed then was a good reason). This was part of my rebellion against my Southern upbringing — the most anti-feminist thing I could think of at the time was making food and being confined to the role of a homemaker. Armed with the ease of binary thinking, I made cooking my adversary, and nothing could make me bend my own will to its seemingly submissive character.
Fast-forward to the second semester of my freshman year — hopelessly lost in a sea of utensils and ingredients, my desire to be independent and “make my own path” had rendered me, ironically, dependent.
My stance against a life-sustaining practice, based solely upon my own superficial assumptions, sounds so ridiculous now. In retrospect, it pains me how I was unable to see through such a sloppy generalization. But this was a lesson I needed to learn. I was wrong about something I had extreme confidence in. My reasoning was flawed. Turns out I really do need to learn how to cook.
We try to plan for everything. Especially at this school. Whether or not we’d like to admit it, we all wanted (on some subconscious level) to get into a school like this, and we mapped out every step of our life in order to get here. Optimization and opportunity costs and all those other notorious Ec 10a words were our unconscious mantra, guiding our path to the cobblestoned sidewalks of Cambridge.
And maybe this is just a me thing, but the idea of something I am confidently doing now actually being the long-term “wrong decision” is enough to send me into an anxiety spiral. Alarm bells sound in my head and I immediately renegotiate my situation and search for the optimal one. This is what I thought I was doing with cooking — I thought I had planned out this campaign against cooking with such precision, efficiency, and skill that it would never come around to mess with the plans I had made for my future. That is, until I sat at the kitchen table the second semester of my freshman year, salivating at the sight and smell of chicken and broccoli, unable to replicate it for myself.
A silly example, maybe, but it exemplifies a phenomenon a lot of Harvard students are scared of — being wrong about something we thought was right.
Being proven wrong, or “making a mistake,” sounds great in the abstract — it’s a slogan we’ve seen in every elementary school classroom, plastered on primary color posters accompanied by some cartoon animal. But actually having to admit fault is a different story.
It is ok to make mistakes, to be “caught slipping,” as my roommate Eleanor iconically puts it. Because, honestly, no one cares. No one is looking at you as closely as you think they are. These “mistakes” that we think we are making are actually just the processes of figuring life out; we’ve just stigmatized them to the point of being the benchmark for judgment, digging our own social grave in the process.
So, in this last article, I give you the final key to the Houston to Harvard mindset, and arguably the hardest one to accept (especially for me). Part of learning to see the world with nuance is realizing that your own actions are not always right, that they are not always on the positive side in the spectrum of decisions. We make mistakes in how we reason away the fault in our own behavior, and we make mistakes in pointing out the faults in others that, in actuality, are really just mirrors of ourselves. But, a lot of the time, these decisions also do not need to be categorized as “mistakes” — rather, every day we simply make decisions that help us figure out this mess we call life, some good and some bad and some in the wonderful in-between.
And a final side note — if the first thought you have in reading this article is “man, I know a lot of people who need to read this, people that really need to be shown that they are wrong,” then you’ve missed the point entirely.
The final stage of the Houston to Harvard mindset? Seeing the nuance and capacity for “mistakes” in your own actions, because like everything else in this messed up world, nothing is ever as black-and-white as it seems.
So yes, maybe I will just have to learn how to cook.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a Harvard professor placed his hand on my lower back, I decided I was being dramatic. This was totally okay! The fact that it made me uncomfortable was my fault! The professor had invited students to a holiday party, and we had all been excited to go. Not only was this professor a big deal, but he seemed to truly care about us. After a group of us arrived, he came over to greet us warmly and lead us to the next room, where the party was getting started. As he shepherded us in, he walked close behind me, putting a hand on the small of my back, pressing into me. I jumped forward a bit, involuntarily. His hand went away. We all walked into the room and enjoyed the party.
This man doesn’t teach here anymore. He has a better gig somewhere else.
This fall, on our first night back on campus since March 2020, my roommate and I were both groped at a party by a guy who was leaving. He was holding hands with a girl leading him towards the exit. She presumably did not notice as he groped me and then my roommate in quick succession. We were stunned, not fully processing what had happened until the guy and girl were swallowed up by the crowd.
Naming this guy, or the professor, wouldn’t solve much, nor would it bring me any sense of peace. Calling guys out, so I’ve been told, could jeopardize their future, or, horror of horrors, embarrass them. And frankly, if I started down that road, it would never end. Sexual misconduct is everywhere at Harvard, if you bother to look. For many of us, it’s easier not to.
The behavior I’m talking about, while sometimes tricky to define, represents an entitled way of relating to women. To say that it’s been normalized here is to state the obvious. To say that every guy guilty of it could go on to achieve immense success is too. To complain feels, at times, like a sign of immaturity, a failure to grasp the realities of the real world and adapt accordingly. Having been successfully gaslit too many times to count, I question my own discomfort with behavior that maybe isn’t even so bad. Maybe it’s normal. Maybe I should get over it.
Maybe, this is just reality.
There’s the male acquaintance who sharply squeezes my neck whenever we hug hello; the men I’ve never met who grip my waist as they move past in a crowd, which I’m sure they do to other men, too, why wouldn’t they; the guys whose drunk behavior requires dangling their arms around girls’ shoulders and defiantly refusing to let go; the older guy I met recently who kept rubbing my arms even as I backed away (when I told a friend later that this man had made me uncomfortable, he told me not to take it personally); the two different guys, on different occasions, who hurled their entire bodies at me while dancing; the classmate who caressed my stomach over my shirt at a party (I did a great job convincing myself to let it go because, well, it was his birthday party); the guy who announces his presence in a room by coming up behind girls and massaging their shoulders.
I could keep going.
Most men here don’t do this, but most women have experienced it. Something especially frustrating about this issue is how easy it is to solve. To begin with, guys here need to hold each other to higher standards. Right now, the bar is pretty low.
Again and again, the “nice guys” are complicit. Are they terrified of offending a friend with clout? With money? Or just problem set answers? Too often, these nice guys see themselves as underdogs. Instead of getting bolder with age, they seem to have grown more comfortable ignoring or excusing bad behavior. This isn’t Opening Days anymore; the stakes are higher. A quick cost-benefit analysis of one’s future is all it takes to determine that a man once deemed creepy is now salvageable. Maybe he could put in a good word someplace it counts, invite the nice guy to the party that will change everything, help him switch from underdog to inner circle. Values realign and ranks close.
It’s almost moving, the lengths that men here will go to protect each other.
With so many men — and women — acting as enablers, it feels pointless to push back. Why bother? I’ve asked myself this many times this semester. Years of gaslighting have worked on me. Anxious not to seem bitter or sensitive or like I’m playing the victim, I can instead convince myself that I’m being dramatic. I can continue to go to parties and have a waist ready to be grabbed and a lower back eager to be touched. I can continue to show up and accept what I now know is reality.
When my roommate and I came home from the party our first night back on campus, we commiserated about the guy who groped us, angry at his behavior and angrier at ourselves for not doing anything about it. “I haven’t been groped since March 2020,” my roommate said. At the same time, we both joked: “It’s good to be back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her swan song column, Amy Saltzman, until recently the Cambridge Chronicle’s only full-time reporter, did not mince words, arguing that “media is underfunded and under siege.” Her own experience at the Chronicle, the oldest surviving weekly newspaper in the United States, supports her diagnosis of the industry. When hired in 2012, Saltzman was one of a full team of reporters and several photographers, and an editor. Four years later, she was the only member of the team.
Saltzman, who has left the paper for a teaching job at Boston University, has been replaced by another full-time employee, so at least one other individual is left to man the ship. But her departure and column cast a glaring light on the decimation of the Chronicle’s staff and, more broadly, the wilting state of local journalism.
It would be dishonest to spin Saltzman’s departure to argue only one man is left reporting in Cambridge. The Boston Globe covers Cambridge extensively and, not to toot our own horn, The Crimson itself aims to cover news relevant to all Cantabridgians. But the Globe juggles covering all of New England and appealing to a national audience, just as we juggle this paper with classes. The dedication local papers have to only covering life in their localities is unique, and crucial to a functioning democracy. Having an eye constantly trained on Cambridge politics means local papers like the Chronicle can serve as a watchdog and check to power. A familiar eye can pick out the stories, large and small, that really matter to local residents. But the capacity of the Chronicle, and all local papers, to serve as a watchdog and best serve its audience is neutered when staff gets whittled down to one.
Local media is in deep trouble. Classic revenue streams for papers — print ads and classifieds — have slowed, to put it generously, to a trickle (and the digital ads market, dominated by the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, has proven a poor replacement). In an age where much of the internet is free to access, 80 percent of Americans throw their hands up at paywalls rather than subscribe to a paper. Many, like the Cambridge Chronicle, must rely on being bought up by giant media conglomerates to stay afloat. But acquisition has not treated the Chronicle well. Staff cuts came soon after the paper was bought by GateHouse Media, which left staff working 36 hours straight in a scramble to cover events, like the Boston Marathon bombing, that had a seismic effect on Cambridge. After a merger, the Chronicle is now owned by Gannett, the biggest player of them all, which, as of 2019, owned one-sixth of all print papers in the nation.
Though perhaps undesirable, acquisition by a conglomerate, or even a hedge fund, can be one of the few options papers have to stay afloat; an end which, undoubtedly, is good (yay employment!). The proliferation of nonprofit newsrooms like the Texas Tribune and Tampa Bay Times is encouraging, but starting one requires enormous fundraising campaigns. Publishers and journalists are trying to get entrepreneurial. Maria Ressa, one of two journalists awarded the Nobel Prize this year, is CEO of Rappler, a digital media company focused on watchdog investigative journalism; Axios is attempting to “bundle” local newspapers in a single newsletter subscription to spread the love and entice greater readership. We admire these approaches. But ultimately, these new models are not enough to save existing, ailing newspapers.
Heads more creative than ours must be put together to figure out a model to save local journalism. But we have two simple recommendations that can only help. Subscribe to your local newspaper, be that the Chronicle or your hometown; aspiring journalists, consider working at one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard prepares to host two Commencement ceremonies in four days this spring, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he is unconcerned about the hordes of people who will be traveling to campus for the events.
The University will hold a joint Commencement ceremony for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, which graduated online due to the pandemic. The exercises will take place on May 29, just days after the Class of 2022’s Commencement exercises.
Bacow said in an interview Thursday he hopes the crowds the events attract will help local businesses.
“The businesses in the area have suffered greatly during the course of the pandemic,” he said. “By actually detaching reunion from Commencement and having two separate Commencements close together but not exactly at the same time, we actually create more opportunities for local area businesses.”
The Commencement ceremonies will be closely followed by in-person reunions for class years ending in two or seven. Bacow said he is confident in the University’s ability to handle the large number of alumni, graduates, and families who are expected to flock to Cambridge for the events.
“I’m not concerned about the sheer number of people,” Bacow said. “We know how to handle big crowds.”
Bacow also said Thursday that the school decided against holding separate ceremonies for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 due to difficulties in planning. He had previously committed to hosting in-person celebrations with “as much pomp and circumstance” as traditional Commencement Exercises.
“Logistically, there’s just a huge amount of planning that goes on for all of these,” he said. “And as a practical matter, separating the two — the Classes of 2020 and 2021 — into two separate Commencements would be beyond challenging. We also recognize that, as a practical matter, not everybody is going to come back for these Commencements.”
He added that the school expects more College graduates to return for the ceremony than alumni from the University’s professional schools.
“We believe we’ll have no difficulty in accommodating everybody in one ceremony,” he said. “It was our goal to have something that is as close to a traditional Commencement as we’re capable of doing.”
Bacow said the two ceremonies will have separate speakers, who have already been selected. He declined, however, to reveal who the school has tapped.
Harvard has pledged to offer on-campus housing accommodations for returning graduates, subject to limited availability. The University will also provide financial assistance for graduates who require assistance with travel costs.
“We anticipate being able to provide aid to those who need it, and we don’t anticipate that everybody will need it,” Bacow said.

Harvard University Dining Services began piloting a hot kosher lunch option in Quincy House on Wednesday.
Upon request, the meals are prepared and individually wrapped in the presence of a kosher supervisor — known as a “mashgiach” — at Harvard Hillel and then heated in Quincy, according to a HUDS communication sent out to students who keep kosher on Monday.
Kosher hot lunch was supposed to be offered at the beginning of the semester as a part of HUDS’ plan to increase inclusive dining, according to an email sent students from HUDS director Smitha S.H. Haneef over the summer.
“The launch was delayed, and then altered, as we worked through issues around appropriate coverage to ensure that the food remained kashrut,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an emailed statement.
Kosher foods are those that conform to Jewish dietary regulations — known by the Hebrew word “kashrut” — which prohibit the mixing of meat and milk products and prescribe that animals be slaughtered according to kosher rules and that a mashgiach supervise food preperation. The dietary regulations also oppose kosher food mixing with non-kosher food or even touching utensils that have touched non-kosher food.
Kosher-keeping students have relied on the few kosher options offered at and around Harvard: Hillel's dining hall, some sandwiches offered by HUDS' grab-and-go food service Flyby, and the ice cream shop J.P. Licks. Some students who adhere less strictly to kosher dietary laws may also eat at Clover or dining-hall salad bars.
The lunchtime option will be available Monday through Friday in Quincy House. Hillel caters kosher food during Shabbat on Saturday. Kosher-keeping students, however, will be left without a Harvard-provided lunch option on Sundays, since both Flyby and the new program will be closed.
On Tuesday, Rebecca S. Araten ’23, who keeps kosher, said she saw another kosher-keeping student eat two cookies for their entire lunch.
“That, I think, really sums up the kosher food experience in many ways — people eating what they can scavenge in the Hillel building or sometimes getting the Flyby sandwiches," said Araten, who is a former Crimson News editor.
Araten, who is a former president of Hillel, said the availability of kosher hot lunch is “something kosher-keeping students have been pushing for, for years and years.”
“This is not something spontaneous that the University has decided to do,” Araten said. “For as long as I’ve been here, there have been conversations and meetings and reports that Hillel presidents have compiled about the experiences of kosher-keeping students.”
Jacob M. Miller ’25 said he is relieved by the new kosher lunch option. He said he was “frustrated” throughout the semester, however, by having to pay full price for a meal plan but only receiving one hot kosher meal.
“It's just frustrating because it feels like a basic need that isn't always being fulfilled,” he said.
Araten said she believes roughly 20 students keep “strict kosher" on Harvard's campus. She said she believes “many more” stand to benefit from the new option.
Araten called the new pilot an “important step” for Harvard.
“Having a hot kosher lunch option at Harvard shows that they are willing to do what it takes to maintain a religiously observant Jewish community,” she said.

Harvard Medical School received a $150,000 donation on Nov. 19 to support the development of an office for community-centered medical education.
The funding was provided by a private donor and will be used to promote the HMS Office for Community Centered Medical Education’s mission of fostering connections between HMS and Harvard School of Dental Medicine students and marginalized populations in the greater Boston area.
Since discussions of the office’s development began at HMS last spring, the office had a soft launch this fall, created a community health project with the HMS Office for Scholarly Engagement, and submitted its formalized vision, core values, and strategic plan to HMS leadership.
The office’s steering committee, led by Nancy E. Oriol — HMS’s associate dean for community engagement in medical education — hosted a series of town halls and online surveys to gauge the specific needs of students, faculty, and members of historically underserved regions in Boston.
“One thing that’s really important is when you think about community engagement, there’s this concept of slow co-production,” Oriol said. “When you create something, you should co-create it with the people who are going to be impacted by it.”
According to a survey administered by the HMS and HSDM student council to 80 percent of first-year medical students, 88 percent either agreed or strongly agreed that community engagement would be a part of their future careers in medicine or dentistry. Moreover, 85 percent either agreed or strongly agreed that the office for community-centered medical education would “enhance their educational experience.”
Building upon numerous conversations and survey results, the committee created a framework for the office’s intended mission and values, which include anti-racism, transparency, inclusivity, longitudinal sustainability, reciprocity, justice, and investment.
One of the office’s primary goals, according to Oriol, is to build trust and meaningful relationships with community organizations while helping to accommodate a busy and ever-changing population of medical students.
The office has also worked to create a community health pathway within the Medical School’s scholarly project graduation requirement, in which students explore a health-related issue and receive faculty mentorship.
Typically, the most robust support had been provided to students who engaged in research, international work, or clinical work for their scholarly project requirement, per Oriol. There was no existing pathway within the project’s guidelines that specifically encouraged student engagement with the greater Boston area.
“It hasn’t always been that the medical establishment felt that this type of work was a currency for scholarship,” Oriol said. “This past year has taught us that it is critical medical scholarship — that the structural racism that has impacted people's health was not part of the way we tended to talk about medicine.”
“The consequences of systematically devaluing communities, under-resourcing, has led to a healthcare landscape that must be addressed,” she added.
Oriol explained the office intends to develop a website that will serve as a centralized hub to list community engagement resources and mentorship opportunities for students and faculty to utilize.
“Harvard has always allowed 1,000 flowers to bloom — which is a lovely thing — but organizing that so that it’s usable by both students and community and faculty is one of the first things we have to do,” she said.
Oriol added that she believes public service engagement is crucial in training a medical workforce to provide healthcare for a diverse population of individuals, particularly those from marginalized groups disproportionately affected by health issues.
“It’s an incredibly important foundation for building physicians who are ready to care for all patients — physicians who are ready to understand how the context of the patient’s life impacts what they can do,” Oriol said.

The Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study is expanding its “#metoo Digital Media Collection,” a project that began in 2017 to cumulate the digital footprint of the social media-driven #MeToo movement.
Activist Tarana Burke started the #MeToo movement in 2006 to support survivors of sexual abuse. After sexual misconduct allegations embroiled Hollywood director Harvey Weinstein in October 2017, the movement gained momentum as sexual abuse survivors took to Twitter and other social media platforms to share their stories using the hashtag.
Harvard Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen, a member of the project’s steering committee, said she joined the project because she believes it is “very important” for the library to preserve digital data from the movement.
“It would be entirely appropriate for the Schlesinger to start to document and archive materials relating to the #MeToo movement from the perspective of gender and the law,” she said.
Schlesinger Library Director and steering committee chair Jane Kamensky explained how the expansive network of the digital #MeToo movement necessitated a novel approach to gathering information for the collection.
“We set out to collect as much as we could of the Twitter record of a movement built around the hashtag, and all of the other hashtags that engaged in chorus,” Kamensky said. “So this meant that we built rather than received the collection, which is a different kind of process for the library.”
Kamensky said collecting data from social media poses unique challenges. She said the library must adjust to this method of data collection if it wants to accurately collect the footprint of future social movements.
Head of Digital Collections and Services at Schlesinger Library Jennifer Weintraub said working with digital data was a new experience for her, as she sifted through Twitter bots to build a corpus that is limited to “actual human beings tweeting.”
Weintraub said the project also raised ethical questions among the steering committee members.
“Why are we doing this? Who could we be hurting? What are we thinking about? Why is this important?” Weintraub said. “Thinking out our project and what we were doing and why, and writing it down on our website enabled us to feel more confident about what we were doing.”
Weintraub added that the steering committee was able to address other ethical issues by working with faculty members who have experience working with large datasets.
Kamensky said she hopes the unique set of data gathered by the project will serve different sets of researchers.
“It allows us to serve different communities of researchers who know how to encounter history in the form of huge data rather than history in the form of tiny data, which is what it’s like to study a series of letters or a diary. So we’re engaging with new communities of researchers, which is really exciting for us,” Kamensky said.
Weintraub also pointed to the possibility of expanding the scope of the Schlesinger Library’s project.
“We’re not a monolith, and #MeToo might not mean as much to certain segments of American women,” she said. “But it would be interesting to sort of tease it out, and maybe there’s better hashtags.”

The Comedy Studio will relocate from Somerville to Harvard Square in 2022, taking over the space on JFK Street that was formerly occupied by the Curious George Store.
The “World’s Only Curious George Store” vacated the storefront in June 2019 after a change in ownership. Though it originally planned to move to Central Square, after a 2021 rebrand as Curious George & Co. the shop closed permanently, according to a website announcement posted by the store owner.
The Comedy Studio, a comedy club that opened in the mid-1990s, has its own history in Harvard Square. Until 2017, it was located on the third floor of the Hong Kong.
Rick Jenkins, a comedian and the owner of the Comedy Studio, said he views the move from Somerville to Harvard Square as a “coming home.”
Jenkins and his team found the location during the past year’s quarantine, a period when many businesses and locations were “in flux.”
“Quickly, we saw that things were in flux, and just kind of put our ears out there. This was the very first space we looked at, and it checked all the boxes,” Jenkins said. “Being in Harvard Square — I never dreamed of being able to reach that space.”
For Jenkins, the center of Harvard Square has always been “more than iconic.” He worked at the Harvard Coop when he was building his career as a comedian. Catch a Rising Star — a comedy club active in the 1980s — was also once located on JFK Street.
With a capacity of 200 seats, the Comedy Studio’s new location is approximately 40 percent larger in size than its former Somerville location, which will enable the club to accommodate more productions and shows, according to Jenkins.
Jenkins said he hopes to feature both national and local comics at the club. Though he plans to have seasoned professionals — like Eugene Mirman of the TV Show “Bob’s Burgers” — on the stage for regular shows, Jenkins also wants to welcome amateur local talent.
“We envision that the core will be developing new talent, but also having a lot of old Comedy Studio friends,” he added.
On top of performances, the Comedy Studio also offers classes for aspiring comics, such as “Stand-Up 101.”
Jenkins said he hopes the club will become a “cornerstone” of Harvard Square and its community.
“I really see a comedy club as part of a community,” Jenkins said. “If someone gets off the subway at Harvard and looks around, and says, ‘Oh, I want to be a comedian, let me go in here.’ That’s what I want to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Public Opinion Project — an Institute of Politics program that conducts a semesterly poll of young Americans — discussed how young people fear for their future at an IOP forum on Thursday.
The forum came one day after the release of the IOP’s fall poll, which found that the majority of young people in the United States view American democracy as “failed” or “in trouble.” The Youth Poll surveys Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 on topics such as climate change, the future of democracy, foreign policy, and Covid-19.
The panel — which was moderated by Washington Post reporter Jacqueline M. Alemany ’11 — featured John Della Volpe, the IOP’s director of polling, and Jing-Jing Shen ’23, who serves as the student chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project.
“No generation has been through more in a shorter period of time than folks in this room — Gen Z,” Della Volpe said during the forum.
The forum included a panel of IOP student members, who shared personal experiences to contextualize the poll’s data. The survey found that a majority of young Americans face mental health challenges. Just over 50 percent of young people reported feeling down, depressed, and hopeless at least several times in the past two weeks.
“It’s hard to know that all of us feel this way across the national scale, but also, personally, I’m seeing that more with close friends,” said Janna E. Ramadan ’23, the IOP’s incoming student president.
The poll also showed that young people of color are more hopeful for the future of the U.S. compared to their white counterparts. Della Volpe, who is coming out with a book in January about how Gen Z is reshaping U.S. politics, attributed the hopefulness, in part, to Black Lives Matter protests that took place in the summer of 2020 after the murder of George Floyd.
“I think there’s a level of stress and trauma that we picked up in the survey,” he said, noting that a large majority of African Americans reported facing discrimination based on their skin color. “Seeing that they could, with other members of their generation — white, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, etc. — band together to come to support Black lives in response to Floyd’s murder, I think made African Americans feel better about this country.”
The poll also revealed an increased awareness of climate change. Fifty-four percent of respondents reported feeling worried about the the issue. Della Volpe said in an interview that he believes unease around climate change may contribute to the overall increase in young people who struggle with mental health.
“Climate and Covid are correlated with overall anxiety and depression,” he said. “I think that the government has addressed many of these issues — through Covid-related aid packages, through the bipartisan infrastructure package. That hasn’t necessarily been communicated well to young people, which is making them even more stressful.”
Shen said she hopes a main takeaway from the poll is Gen Z’s open-mindedness.
“It’s pretty clear that young people respect and value others, even if they look different than themselves or have a different political opinion or just fundamentally disagree,” she said. “The fact that we can have these difficult conversations and we’re open to continue learning — I think that’s really inspiring about our generation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven Harvard graduate student organizations submitted a letter to Harvard University Health Services Wednesday calling on Harvard to increase the refill quantity limit for medications used to treat and prevent HIV infection.
Sent on World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the letter — addressed to HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen — urges the University to increase the quantity limit of an HIV medication refill from 30 days to 90 days. Under the Harvard University Student Health Program, prominent medications used to treat and prevent HIV fall under medications that are limited to 30-day supplies, per refill, at network pharmacies.
The letter requests that HUHS formally review and alter the 30-day medication list with its insurance partner Blue Cross Blue Shield at the beginning of the new calendar year.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email that Nguyen plans to respond directly to the undersigned organizations, which include LGBTQ@GSAS, Harvard Law School Lamda, and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
In the letter, the student groups argued the current quantity limit puts patients at risk. The current 30-day supply limit increases the potential for discontinuity of care, according to the letter.
The letter also states that the 30-day quantity limit “runs counter” to the 90-day dosage recommendation for HIV medication offered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“On May 15, 2020, the CDC issued a ‘Dear Colleague’ letter to providers, recommending that clinicians ‘consider providing a prescription for a 90-day supply of PrEP medication (rather than a 30-day supply with two refills) to minimize trips to the pharmacy and to facilitate PrEP adherence,’” the letter reads.
The letter addresses the stigma faced by patients seeking HIV treatment or preventative medication.
Lamda co-president Courtney G. Dougherty, a third-year student at the Law School, said she believes the 30-day supply limit exacerbates prejudice surrounding people vulnerable to HIV.
“Specializing it [HIV medication] for what is essentially no reason — at least that I can think of — only adds to that level of stigma,” Dougherty said. “The stigma around it really is so nefarious and unnecessary, and just incorrect. And then from there, it just makes people’s lives easier.”
Dougherty, who works at on issues surrounding trans and BGLTQ+ healthcare discrimination at the Law School, called the 30-day supply limit “arbitrary.”
“We know that PrEP [pre-exposure prophylaxis] is this amazing drug, and we know it’s so helpful — it basically makes your viral load of HIV non-existence, it prevents the spread of this disease, it does all of these things,” she said. “There’s no reason why we should just put one more straw on the camel’s back.”
LGBTQ@GSAS co-president Daniel A. Arias, who helped draft the letter, said 30-day supply limits place an additional onus on patients.
“It puts additional barriers in place for patients already facing significant challenges in accessing equitable, high-quality healthcare,” he wrote in a Wednesday press release.
Arias, who is a graduate student in Population Health Sciences, recognized efforts made by HUHS to support the health of BGLTQ+ students at Harvard. He said he hopes HUHS builds on its commitment by implementing the letter’s recommendations.
“We are hopeful that HUHS will be responsive to the concerns we raise,” he said. “And we have reason to be hopeful: HUHS has done excellent work to promote LGBTQ+ health at Harvard, and we know they remain dedicated to ensuring equitable health care that meets student needs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For twin brothers Rory and Pat Plunket, the short walk between Mather House and Winthrop House might be the farthest apart they have ever been.
“We’ve never spent more than a week or two weeks away from each other, which is really weird to think about over 20 years,” Pat said.
As sophomore heavyweight rowers for the Harvard Crimson, and as international students from Zimbabwe, the Plunket twins have formed a special bond.
Growing up in Zimbabwe, before high school, the Plunkets never really got exposed to rowing, but their natural surroundings imbued them with an appreciation for nature and for sports. They spent years of their childhood running around the local forests, hiking in the mountains, camping, and fishing.
“We grew up on a forestry estate in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe, very remote, bordering Mozambique, near a local village called Chimanimani,” Rory said.
“It was very organic and very outdoors,” Pat explained.
Their family farm grows avocados and macadamia nuts, which are exported to countries like China and the Netherlands.
Despite their sporty background, until high school, the Plunkets had never rowed before. One summer, on holiday from Hilton College, their boarding school in South Africa, the Plunkets decided to try their hand at rowing. Their father had actually rowed during his secondary school years in England, although “not very well” according to Rory. Despite a rocky start, the twins continued to work with their coach, Ernie Steenkamp, to improve their craft.
“Our coach was the ex-national junior team coach in South Africa, and he really saw something good in us, and so we carried on quite seriously,” Pat said.
However, rowing is not a particularly popular or well-resourced sport in Zimbabwe, and the Plunkets did not have the best resources when they tried to hone their skills at home. Their main practice area was Mizowe Lake, located about 45 minutes north of Zimbabwe’s capital city Harare.
“We used to have very limited resources, boats, and sheds with corrugated iron, all locked up with this big padlock,” Rory said. “We rowed there during our holidays, and I think the team was made up of four people — the two of us, one other guy, and a girl,” Rory explained.
Their competition during the offseason was further complicated by long travel itineraries and the distance between schools with rowing programs in Zimbabwe. At boarding school in South Africa, the Plunkets ran into a similar problem in their training and competition.
“Our school was the only school that rowed within a seven-hour radius, so we were super isolated. We were the smallest sports team at school. It started off with a bunch of us, and then by the end of our time, it was only my brother and I,” Pat said.
Despite the small size of the team and the isolation of their school, the Plunkets found a great mentor in Steenkamp at their boarding school. “He was this old Afrikaans man, and pretty strict,” Pat said.
Considering the amount of time they spent together throughout high school, they quickly developed a strong relationship. To get to their competitions in the capital city of Pretoria, the Plunkets and Steenkamp regularly drove seven hours with a big boat trailer attached to the back of their car.“Me and Patrick spent the majority of our years in high school, nearly every weekend, in this old Land Cruiser that was probably 25 years old. It was the most uncomfortable thing, and we just spent hours and hours in it,” Rory said.
“He was kind of like our mentor since we spent so much time with him,” said Pat, and the twins still keep in touch with Steenkamp regularly.
Since the outset of their careers, the Plunkets have come a long way, rowing at the 2019 World Championships in Tokyo, even reaching a final there. The Plunkets, since coming to Harvard, have rowed in the heavyweight class, although they are on the smaller side for that weight class.
“Usually it’s someone who’s a bit heavier, a bit taller, around six foot four, maybe 210 pounds,” Rory said. “And we’re below that right now.”
While the Plunkets went from inexperienced to international competitors in just a few short years, even still, the training regimen for the first semester on the heavyweight team has been a step up.
“We’re on the water twice Monday, once Tuesday, once Thursday, twice Friday,” with a final session on Saturday morning, according to Rory.
Outside of those coach-organized practices on the water, it is up to the athletes to decide how to train, whether that means putting in an extra session in the weight room or more time on the Ergo bike.
On Fridays, the team is organized into different boats for internal racing competitions, with all grades being mixed into different boats. Despite the mixing and matching of the boats, the high caliber of all rowers on the team makes it easy to develop chemistry.
“Honestly, sometimes it just clicks,” Pat said. “Everyone here is very good. It’s pretty ridiculous the depth of the club, and so sometimes, it’ll take a bit longer to get the boat going, but usually, for the most part, it’s a very high standard.”
“Last week, we had a Lord of the Rings theme, and our boat was the wizards. It’s usually the guys who are a little bit more technical, and maybe a bit small, but we just seem to click,” said Rory, adding that the heavyweight squad can have fun and keep things light-hearted even amidst the intense training.
The men’s heavyweights only competed in the Head of the Charles Regatta and the Foot of the Charles Regattas in the fall, but the upcoming spring season will feature a much fuller slate that the fall builds up to.
Coming from an environment where rowing teams were small and where the nearest competition was seven hours away, Pat and Rory have come to love the camaraderie and competitive spirit that the rowing club provides — a big change from solo rides with Steenkamp to regattas.
“Everyone is so competitive, and they always want the best for their teammate, and we make sure to do stuff outside of rowing together,” Pat said.
Since the Plunkets are international students who missed their first year on campus, the rowing team has taken on added significance for the brothers, providing a welcoming community since day one on campus.
“It’s a very international team,” commented Rory, as the squad boasts members from England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the United States, in addition to Zimbabwe.
“Everyone brings different things, and everyone is just so happy to be here,” Pat noted. “It’s all like-minded people who want to work hard, but they want to have a good time at the same time.”
Off the water, Pat is involved with Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners and the Harvard Investment Association, while Rory is involved with Harvard Ventures. Rory is planning to concentrate in economics, with a secondary in history and a citation in French, while Pat is still deciding on his academic concentration.
For Rory, after he graduates from Harvard, he is looking to work in London, or potentially back in Africa, in a place like Kenya. For Pat, he is considering working in London or in New York, where the Plunkets have family. They also have dreamt about attending business school at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.
As far as staying involved in rowing, both Pat and Rory are just focused on the present.
“I’d love to have a really good time with my rowing [and] take it very seriously while I'm here,” Rory said.
In the future, looking to continue with the athletic knack, the Plunkets envision being involved in CrossFit training programs, as well as local rowing clubs.
As twin brothers, heavyweight rowers, and students interested in economics and finance, the Plunkets are frequently compared to Harvard alumni Cameron Winklevoss ’00 and Tyler Winklevoss ’00, twin heavyweight rowers who competed in the 2008 Olympics and were involved in the founding of Facebook and Gemini.
“When we first got into Harvard, I think every second comment was ‘Oh, it’s the Winklevosses again,’'” Rory joked.
While they do not resent the comparison, they also look forward to forging their own paths.
“It’s a pretty cool comparison to have. They’re awesome, successful guys,” Pat said. “But I definitely want to be known as the Plunkets at some point.”

Oh, Harvard Square Starbucks, it has been 12 days since you closed your door forever and still, my broken heart is not yet healed. How do you say goodbye to the one constant part of your college experience, even if that experience included seeing my bank account getting depleted every four or five days when I added more funds to my Starbucks card? I had taken you for granted, oh Harvard Square Starbucks. You can’t go. You had so much business that the thought of your closing never crossed my mind. Please forgive me. Therefore, Harvard Square Starbucks, please know that even though you’re gone, you are never forgotten.
I will always remember our good times together. How I religiously ordered the venti Caramel Frappuccino despite acknowledging that there is no caffeine in that drink to keep me awake. How I frequented you more often than I did Annenberg during my first year on campus. How the Internet would always stop working as soon as I entered the store because the Starbucks Wi-Fi was never connected fast enough. How easily I was tricked into going to the store every day for more Starbucks stars despite knowing that I would be spending more money. How I would try to avoid the looks of concern in the baristas’ eyes whenever I ordered that venti Caramel Frappe in the middle of Boston winter.
You may not notice, but you have carried me through countless 10:30 a.m. lectures, 2-hour-long seminars, and late evening study sessions. I loved you despite all your flaws. For example, closing at the ungodly early hours of 8 p.m. even though you’re a coffee shop located literally on a college full of procrastinating, over-achieving perfectionists who desperately need that sugar and caffeinated rush for the semi-regular all-nighter, or the long straw shortage earlier this semester.
In the whirlwind years of 2020 and 2021, you were my rock and my anchor. Now that you are gone, there seems to be a venti Frappuccino-shaped hole in my heart. I don’t know what to do anymore. No where else can make a Caramel Frappuccino like you did. And your sister coffee shop — Broadway Market Starbucks — is too far away for the quick trip to get coffee during my shift at work or in between my classes.
Harvard Square Starbucks, did you know that you were on my pro-con list when I made my decision to come to Harvard? There is no Starbucks at my state school, the Starbucks on MIT campus does not have the Caramel Frappuccino, and the nearest Starbucks from Columbia’s campus is located two blocks away. Of course, I was not vain enough to base my college decisions solely on you, but know that your proximity to Harvard Yard did not go unnoticed. Yet now, you are gone. 😭
I know that you will return soon next fall. But I don’t know if I am strong enough for an entire semester without you. I might just take a gap semester, to be honest. I don’t want to end this obituary on a sad note though. So let’s raise our plastic (or paper) cup and wish for a new future when you grace us with your presence once more next fall. Hopefully this time, the Starbucks Wi-Fi will be better and most importantly, the store will be opened later. Either way, I cannot wait to see you again, Starbucks.
xoxo,
Your biggest fan.
