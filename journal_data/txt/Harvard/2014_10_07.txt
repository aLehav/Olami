After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The premise of Hannah Pittard’s novel “Reunion” seems quite unremarkable at first glance: three siblings are brought together by their father’s suicide, and family drama ensues. In reality, the book is far more complex than one would expect. The narrator, Kate Pulaski, is a failed screenwriter as well as a pathological liar, a reckless spender, a soon-to-be divorcée, and an unloving daughter. At the behest of her elder two siblings, Kate flies to Atlanta to mourn the father she largely despises. There, she is forced to reconcile with the rest of her family: in this case, her father’s four wives after her deceased mother and all of their children. Somehow, Pittard weaves all of these characters and their backstories into a strangely cynical yet satisfying story.The most compelling aspect of “Reunion” is its unreliable narrator, Kate. The entire novel is themed around modern families and dysfunction, and Kate is the epitome of dysfunction. She cheats on her husband—whom she loves—but refuses to apologize; she spends all but her last five dollars on alcohol at the airport; she is only slightly saddened upon hearing about her father’s death. Seeing the world through Kate’s eyes opens a unique perspective to the reader. It is one thing to see her bad choices and conceited lies and their immediate repercussions, but it is another thing entirely to experience her broken thought process and feel what she feels when she categorically and deliberately hurts everyone around her. Debt is mundane, but hearing Kate rationalize her $48,000 credit card debt is oddly compelling.Pittard’s conception of Kate as a dysfunctional character extends beyond the obvious. The reader’s first reaction to Kate and her narrative style is likely one of mild annoyance: everything she says seems to be taken straight from some recent, trashy, run-of-the-mill “page-turner.” At times, Kate seems to try too hard to appear nonchalant about everything—specifically her father’s death and her fragile marriage—while at other points she acts melodramatically. But over the course of the book, the reader learns to appreciate her for her rare but extremely insightful observations, which are only revealed through her emotional outbursts. Some of these outbursts occur in the form of recollective anecdotes, where Kate reveals her experiences with a great deal more reliability than she employs in the rest of the book. She narrates about her childhood, the death of her mother, and her father’s subsequent wives, one of whom “was the kind of stepmother people write bad screenplays about.” The most pivotal of these asides is about how Kate herself became a pathological liar. It tells the story of her first calculated, conscious, cold-blooded lie and ends, “[My husband] says addicts begin to recover when they pinpoint the birth of their addiction. Well, as best I can tell, this is mine.” Despite being about Kate’s past, these short narratives are actually dynamic, as they show her personal growth in action. In fact, “Reunion” is not just about family dysfunction—it is a coming-of-age novel in disguise. Though Kate is not a hormonal adolescent, she still undergoes phenomenal self-discovery over the course of the book. She learns to stop hating her deceased father through a series of events that reveal just how similar the two of them were. Her extremely close-knit relationships with her older siblings, Elliot and Nell, are broken and reforged, while she learns to cope with her in-laws, whom she never considered “family.” Most powerfully, Kate reveals and learns a great deal about herself through another character: her niece Mindy, born to her father’s fifth and final wife. Mindy is a six-year-old who is repeatedly described as the “spitting image” of Kate, and it is through her that Kate is able to see her own past and scars. These experiences lead Kate to conclude, “The most important thing in the world isn’t that I missed my own childhood, but that [Mindy] not miss hers.”The one glaring flaw in the book is its half-hearted effort to try to be “meta.” There are thousands of books and plays that involve the first-person narrator magically being the author and, due to some force in the story, deciding to write the work itself. Over the course of “Reunion,” Kate, a struggling screenwriter, keeps in touch with her agent, who advises her to write a screenplay or a memoir of sorts about her father’s death and her relationships with her family in the ensuing days. About three-quarters of the way through the book, Kate decides that she might write a memoir and that it will start with the sentence “On June 16, at roughly eight thirty in the morning, I get the phone call that my father is dead.” Surprise, surprise: that’s the first sentence of “Reunion”! This seems like Pittard trying too hard simultaneously to follow and buck the trend—she employs a trite technique at an unusual place in the story—but it’s a far cry from the rule-breaking she’s done so successfully throughout the rest of the book.“Reunion” concludes with a quasi-emotional ending that shows both Kate’s deep realizations and the lasting mundanity of her life. One one hand, she learns to accept how similar she is to her father and resolves some long-lasting tension she’s held against him for decades. On the other hand, she is left with a life to rebuild: life doesn’t suddenly get easier just because of the hardships she’s experienced. Her bank account is still empty, her marriage is still far from healthy, her life is still utterly broken. But that’s what “Reunion” is all about, where it notably succeeds. Though three short days may change a person, Pittard understands that Kate still must go on living her life, persevering as best she can.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something undeniably mysterious about the VES Department’s film track here at Harvard. Yes, students know that the well-known acronym stands for Visual and Environmental Studies and that it probably isn’t the place to go if your primary academic interests fall within the realms of entomology or environmental sustainability.
A quick visit to the department’s stylish website doesn’t necessarily clear up the confusion surrounding the department. You’ll find a faculty directory brimming with lauded and award-winning artists and professors. You’ll see that its concentration tracks include areas like studio film and film studies, with objectives like exploring the history and theory of abstract concepts such as “the moving image” and “the built environment.” But it’s likely that you’ll find yourself still wondering about what exactly the VES Department offers.
Take a look at 10 different theses from the department’s film track and you might just get 10 different answers. You’ll be just as likely to come across crass, purposefully obnoxious parodies of reality TV kitsch as you will be to find subtle, thoughtful documentaries about social injustices in little-known places. The scope and range of student projects produced each year speaks to uniqueness of the program.
One might assume that students in the VES film track hold high aspirations for distinguished careers in the film industry, and for good reason. However, by heavily emphasizing creativity over vocational training, the department differs even from film programs offered by other liberal arts institutions. Though such a structure runs the risk of alienating some interested in pursuing film on campus, the VES Department’s film track gets overwhelmingly high marks from students both within and without.
A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION
Not to be confused with conservatory-style film programs such as those boasted by NYU’s Tisch School and USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, Harvard’s undergraduate VES film track has a distinct liberal arts slant. According to Robb Moss, the department’s chair and a professor in film and film studies, the emphasis on liberal arts education is something that the VES faculty values tremendously, one that uniquely shapes the filmmaking experience here at Harvard. “We think about filmmaking here in a somewhat different way. We aren’t exactly a film school; we aren’t an art school; yet we do art; we do film. We are a small liberal arts program,” he said in a phone interview.
Moss explains that much of the difference between liberal arts programs and art school programs is a result of opposing pedagogical styles. “We aren’t working backwards from getting people employment in the ways that a film school does,” he said. “Film schools tend to be organized, and rightly so, around the industrial model of filmmaking broken into its constituent parts. There are courses in cinematography or editing or directing actors, or all the pieces that go into film production.”
At Harvard, Moss said, professors and department staff are more interested in the development of students as artists than they are as craftsmen. "We value [those] crafts, they are certainly important, but they are important in the service of students’ authorial voice. The courses that we teach are more organized around students authoring their own work and having the tools to be expressive about their ideas,” he said.
Alfred Guzzetti, a professor of visual arts in the VES Department, agrees with Moss. In professional training programs, he said, “Three-fourths of time is devoted to the learning of film techniques, and the remaining fourth is set aside for the liberal arts education, such as literature and history.” This, he holds, places an emphasis on teaching students the more explicitly practical aspects of filmmaking through classes such as cinematography and directing, while inherently deemphasizing non craft-oriented studies.
INSIDE THE ART HOUSE
In addition to opportunities to experiment with form, the liberal arts focus of Harvard’s film track allows students the opportunity to make films that span academic disciplines. In the Fall of 2010, Guzzetti collaborated with Music professor Hans Tutschku to offer a course entitled “Electro-acoustic Music and Video in Dialogue.” (VES 157t) The class brought together student filmmakers and student composers with the goal of promoting mutual teaching and learning through the creation of audio-visual projects.
Guzzetti recalls a particularly interesting assignment in which student filmmaker/composer teams were given two projectors, two screens, and four channels of sound, and instructed to make a one-minute long piece in which the imagery and the sound were derived from water. The pairs were made to do the project twice: once with the student composer creating the music and the student filmmaker creating the video, and later with the composer producing the video and the filmmaker the music. Guzzetti credits Harvard’s expansive resources with the ability to undertake such unique and exciting endeavors. “It was a very situation-dependent course. It just so happens that Harvard has an electronic music studio, and it also happens that at Harvard it’s very easy for faculty members to do collaborations,” he said.
For concentrators in the film track, access to varying academic possibilities directly correlates to more creative outlets. Max R. McGillivray ’16, who focuses on film in VES, states that the abundance of creative possibility attracted him to the program. He made his decision to come to Harvard after visiting the VES Department his senior year of high school. He, too, praises the department’s emphasis on the unique ways that the program got its students to think. “I think it’s a great aspect because it gets you out of the way of thinking of filmmakers from other schools,” he said. “I think that’s a very freeing part of the program. You’re not making the same films as everyone else.”
Such artistic idiosyncrasy by way of broad academic exposure is something that Moss attributes to the flexibility of the program. “Generally people aren’t told they can’t do something—students are exposed to different kinds of filmmaking, so they try different things,” he said, recognizing the richness and distinctiveness of student work and applauding their willingness to take risks. “I think there’s a tremendous urge to make things that are like Hollywood or the television shows that you love,” he said of young filmmakers. “You go to the movies as a child, and it’s completely natural to want to make something like that.”
He asserted, though, that filmmakers considering the VES film track need not disavow themselves of their interests in creating more traditional or less experimental projects. “[They] have plenty of opportunity to make something like that going forward, as a graduate student or as a career,” he said. “We think that it’s important to give students the opportunity to do something that isn’t an interpretation of something else. To find out what is inside them, what interests them, what kinds of form that takes.”
AUTEURIAL AUTONOMY
According to VES film concentrator Alistair A. Debling ’16, the artistic freedom that comes with the liberal arts education is one of the principal strengths of the program. "It’s chiefly about being an artist,” he said. “We’re given the freedom to follow our own interests and organize our own learning, be in charge of our own projects."
The result of such autonomy is a remarkably diverse collection of student art produced by VES students each year. It also enables a certain experimental aesthetic, one that casual moviegoers don’t get too much exposure to in the high-budget Hollywood films that dominate mass-market theaters. Debling maintains that in exploring their own interests, VES students learn to challenge industry conventions by “breaking established rules of cinema such as the three-act structure that most all Hollywood films fall into and finding ways of defying strict set of narrative rules.”
This deconstructive artistic act isn’t just edifying for the artist, Debling said, but results in novel and interesting ways of engaging the viewer. For example, he said that a VES class he’s currently enrolled in attempts to probe the space between the alive and the performed, resulting in installation films that “more resemble art that you might see in a gallery as opposed to in a cinema.”
In the hopes of developing their artistic identities, individual students in the VES film track often form what resembles a self-contained mini-production team. They write, shoot, direct, and edit their own material. Moss sees this personal creative process as fundamental to the development of able and distinctive filmmakers. He likens it to the process to of writing—just as authors develop their skills to better understand and translate the world around them through prose, filmmakers develop their own methods to interrogate the world through their various types of work.
ZOOMING OUT
For students outside the concentration, the creative aspect is what attracts them to the department as well. One such student is Zachary L. Wong ’16, who is currently concentrating in English. Though he’s been interested in animation since high school, when it was time to select a college, Wong said the choice represented a major decision in how he would pursue his dream. “I wanted to have a college experience that would allow me to experience life as an artist,” Wong said. “A big component of filmmaking requires you to reflect on life experiences. So, I felt that if I went into a conservatory-type program, I would be going into the field with the life experiences of a high schooler. I thought that it might be more interesting if I just went to school, studied something unrelated, and see where that took me.”
For that reason, Wong declined offers of admissions to film schools and also decided against the film track of the VES concentration here at Harvard. “I figured, I turned down conservatory, so it doesn’t really make sense for me to go to Harvard and kind of take a conservatory path program.”
However, Wong does admit that there are downsides to his decision and is currently considering a secondary in VES. "I miss being a part of a creative environment. I haven’t done a lot of creative work, so now [my motivation] is a feeling of restlessness,” he said." Wong’s decision to take part in VES programs through a secondary or individual classes seems to be a popular one. Even though the size of the film track of the VES department is small, Moss notes the abundance of students outside of the concentration taking VES film classes, adding those classes are practically “bursting at the seams.”
Eric Rentschler, chair of the graduate Film and Visual Studies Program, runs a Harvard Summer School program in conjunction with the Berlin Film Academy Germany that is aimed at providing students like Wong, or students who are less vocationally interested in the art of filmmaking, with a creative outlet. For eight weeks, students in the program take classes, learn about the city, and work on their final project, the artistic culmination of their stay. Like the professors of the VES Department, Rentschler stresses an emphasis on personal artistic realization over learning vocational skills. “By and large, students were curious about the city and getting to know the city and letting the endeavor of making a film be something that helped them focus their stay,” he said in a phone interview. The purpose of the program’s final project was to encapsulate and bring to a head the experience that students had during their time in Berlin in a personal way. “There’s a value in that that is above and beyond pragmatics,” Rentschler said.
FINAL CUT
The VES film track’s approach to filmmaking, though distinctly in line with the goals of the liberal arts education, seems to not be necessarily the best fit for all students. Though anthropology concentrator Temi Fagbenle ’15 said that while she was intrigued by the non-vocational emphasis of the department, as an aspiring actor, she’s more interested in honing her craft through theater classes. “Delving into the performance is what I wanted to do,” she explains. “I was interested in the work being done on the other side of the camera in terms of the creation of the performance, but acting is my chief interest.”
For students like Fagbenle who are more certain of their career aspirations in filmmaking, the VES Department’s lack of focus on teaching those specific crafts isn’t optimal. At the same time, the majority of filmmakers on campus seem to be attracted to VES precisely for the experimental structure. McGillivray lauds, “I personally love that it’s called ‘Visual and Environmental Studies’ because I think that sums up very well the visual objective of the department as well as the environmental—absorbing and conceptualizing the world around us.” It seems that the VES Department, by offering freedom with experimentation and individuality, grants its students a way to look at the world, rather than just skills and training.

What is the role of violence and shock in poetry today? Or, as English professor and critic Stephen Burt asked at the “In Extremis” poetry panel Oct. 1, “What does a poet gain or lose by having blood all over the page?”
This is perhaps one of the most polarizing questions for the vanguards of today’s literary scene. After all, it is framed in the context of an age replete with lurid images available at our fingertips. For many a highbrow critic, excessive sex and gore are undesirable in a lyrical work since these elements have the potential to reduce poetry to kitschy sensationalism. However, this was not the view of Johannes Göransson or Joyelle McSweeney ’97, the two eminent poets seated in the Woodberry Poetry Room with Burt.
Göransson, a poet and literary critic of Swedish origin, has also published numerous works in translation, a field he credits with introducing him to more controversial topics in poetry, such as violence in Korean action novels. Explaining how he sees the American literary environment, he noted, “We are a culture with many images flowing over us, but everything is labeled as ‘obscene.’” In his view, the term is not only hypocritical; it may also have a stultifying effect on our nation’s creative output. “Calling a poem ‘tasteless’ is a way to divorce it from the rest of its genre,” Göransson said. He deplores such a dismissal as closing too many doors for the American literary enthusiast.
For Joyelle McSweeney, award-winning poet and cofounder of Action Books, a press that publishes poetry as well as numerous works in translation, violence holds a rightful, even necessary place in poetry. “Obscene? My work is obscene,” she laughed, asserting that poems should provoke and unsettle the reader. Historically, it is without doubt that shock value has been prominent in any artist’s toolkit. Where would Whitman have been without his heavy use of sexual innuendoes that caused his contemporary John Greenleaf Whittier to allegedly throw “Leaves of Grass” into the fire?
According to McSweeney, poems should reflect one’s social or political reality rather than skating over uncomfortable topics. “My obligation as a poet is to address the violence going on around me and to bring it into visibility,” she said. However, she does not throw blood on the page for its own sake. “It’s not like, ‘If it doesn’t have enough violence, it isn’t cooked yet,’” she chuckled.
Shock value can also be conveyed in other ways besides the written word. “I like to make my live readings as charged as possible,” McSweeney said. “It is ethical to envision poetry as an alternate space [where one can also] conduct violence into audibility.” To demonstrate, McSweeney performed her current work-in-progress, Pistorius Rex, a libretto that presents the murder case of Oscar Pistorius as an allusion to “Œdipus Rex,” complete with a Greek chorus of frogs borrowed from Aristophanes. In this piece, McSweeney does not hesitate to pick apart and expose the most sensitive areas of the case, such as Pistorius’s disability and the ghastliness of the murdered girlfriend’s death: “but why would the dawn…love Pistorius / is it…because he runs—like a woman / or a cat—on blades.”
Such gruesome images were rendered all the more striking by McSweeney’s robotic, choppy pronunciation of each line as she took on the lines of the frog-chorus. She did not give the audience the benefit of a pause before each wave of toneless questions, rattling off one after the other in a mechanical barrage of sound. By audibly stripping the murder case of its pathos, McSweeney left her audience to face alone the full blow of the morbid imagery. This transfer of the emotional burden from performer to the spectators left many feeling like the frogs: helpless bystanders to a Greek tragedy whose fate they are not able to control.
For McSweeney and Göransson, this “staging of the sound” has become the hallmark of the modern extreme poem. Take spoken word poetry, whose fired-up performance poems are popular among the newest generation for what Göransson sees as their “visceral impact” on the audience. No matter how they communicate their power, however, McSweeney and Göransson agreed that poetic works are nothing different from the reality from which they emerge: they simply digest the controversial and vexing events that catch the gaze of any citizen. As McSweeney says, “It’s just that the volume has been turned up.”

Regina Carter has made a name for herself as one of the best jazz violinists of her generation, performing around the world and receiving a MacArthur Fellowship in 2006. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, she was exposed to the city’s vibrant classical and jazz scenes from a young age, fostering her love for both the violin and musical interpretation. In her last three studio albums, Carter has displayed unique vision and curiosity by exploring the stories of her ancestors and reinterpreting them through her own musical lens. Carter will perform in Sanders Theatre on Oct. 17 as part of the Celebrity Series of Boston.
The Harvard Crimson: Since the start of your musical journey, you have learned and picked up on melodies through the Suzuki Method [the practice of learning music by listening rather than reading]. How did this reliance on ear rather than ink-on-page foster your creativity and inventiveness as a jazz artist?
Regina Carter: Back before they were teaching jazz in colleges, when musicians didn’t have money to pay for records, they were learning and listening to tunes on the radio or any shows that might feature jazz on television and then learning the language. All music, every culture, has its own classical music, and for every music, there’s always a folk music—if you will, the people’s music—and a lot of times, we learn that music by ear just as we learned our original language at home by imitating our parents to speak and hearing the inflections that they used. The Suzuki Method is based off that. So it was the most natural way for me to have learned music, and I think it really helps when it comes to hearing the inflections in the different styles and to really be focused on that because I’m not looking at the paper. The dots on the paper can only give you so much information anyway.
THC: In your recent studio albums, “I’ll Be Seeing You: A Sentimental Journey” and “Reverse Thread,” you have explored in depth the music of your parents and ancestors, all of whom grew up in worlds very different from the one we live in today. How do you reinterpret the past in the context of the present, and where do you find the inspiration to do so?
RC: It’s interesting because, hearing that music, it definitely sounds different. You can hear the era; it’s like watching black-and-white movies. Even with this newest record, “Southern Comfort,” hearing those field recordings that were often just a single voice singing into a microphone connected to a tape player, I didn’t really have much to go on except for the melodic line. I can’t recreate that sound, nor am I interested in trying, because that was honest for them. I’m trying to be honest, and I can only play what I’ve experienced, and you can hear that coming out. I’m not going to try to sound like those musicians that played in the past. I’m just trying to present it to my audience, a younger audience and the present audience, and say, ‘This is something you may not have heard.’ 
 So it’s going to sound like me, my voice; I can’t help that, but I try to respect the melodies and not over-decorate it because the real beauty lies within these simple, raw melodies.
THC: What do you hope listeners will experience through your music and interpretation?
RC: You know, I’ve given up hope! There was this one performance right after my mom died, and I was just so sad while playing. But after the concert, people came up to me telling me how great and beautiful it sounded. I got even more angry and sad; I was like, “I’m angry, you’re supposed to feel the anger in this!” That’s when I learned that once you create or play something, you hope people might feel that, but everyone is coming with their own story, and they’re going to experience what you put out there with their own lens on. So I guess I just want people to come, be open, and have an experience. I hope that they like the music and that it conjures up some memories for them, or makes them think about their grandparents, or makes them wonder about their origins. But even if they come and they hate it, they’ve allowed themselves to have an experience. Even if you really hate something, it stirs some memory or emotion within you, and that’s what art is supposed to do—to stir something and to make us feel.

Lorde’s “Yellow Flicker Beat” shows just how suited she is to creating music for “The Hunger Games.” The first song released from the “Mockingjay: Part 1” soundtrack, “Yellow Flicker Beat” is pulsating with energy but made chilling by Lorde’s smooth vocals and characteristically dark lyrics.
The song is divided into two parts which parallel the introspective and action-driven elements of “The Hunger Games” series. The instrumentation sets the mood well in both sections. The slow, unsettling introduction opens with the somber hum of a chorus, giving the opening a human tone. Lorde follows this subdued opening with the resonating drums and faster rhythm of the second section, amping up the intensity of the high-energy climax that continues throughout the rest of the song.
Throughout the changing instrumentation, Lorde’s delivery remains the highlight of the single, holding the attention of the listener with its intensity. Her vocals are versatile and change to match the mood of the separate parts. The beginning is marked by her haunting voice drawn out slowly amid heavy pauses that add emphasis to the words she sings. Her voice becomes more full and gains power to parallel the exhilaration of the second section.
The lyrics of “Yellow Flicker Beat” are characteristic of Lorde’s darker undertones on “Pure Heroine,” another element of the track that makes it an appropriate accompaniment to “The Hunger Games.” She presents a sinister image: “But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison and I’m locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me.” These disconcerting lyrics have a poignancy elevated by the seriousness of Lorde’s voice. Through her memorable vocal performance, Lorde successfully creates excitement for the upcoming “Mockingjay” film.
The soundtrack to “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1” is out Nov. 18 via Republic Records.

Last month, with little fanfare, Arcade Fire’s “Funeral” turned 10.
I didn’t know about it when it came out. I was 10 years old and had never listened to any music recorded after 1992, the year after Talking Heads broke up. It’s just as well. 2004 was a bad year for music. The 2005 Grammy nominees, with few exceptions, were washed up boomers (Bruce Springsteen, U2), overrated teeny-bopper sugar punks (Green Day), or Alicia Keys (Alicia Keys). “Funeral” wasn’t even nominated in the alternative rock category.
By the time I first heard it, people had all but forgotten the songs “Code of Silence” and “Vertigo,” and the kids who still listened to “American Idiot” were manifesting the first signs of arrested development. “Funeral,” on the other hand, had already been showered with praise as one of the best, if not the best, album of the 2000s. I was in high school, and we were settling into musical tribes: the jocks listened to go-go and rap; the STEM kids listened to electronica and metal. These had no particular appeal for me. I knew nothing about hip-hop, and I disliked the cheap emotion of a lot of the techno at the time. My attempt to like metal was more involved but came to an equally unpleasant end.
It was around the time that I abandoned metal to the trash-heap of childhood phases that I discovered “Funeral.” I don’t remember how I heard the name, but I remember very vividly seeing the album cover for the first time: peach background, a hand, and, in the hand, a quill sprouting a huge, fanciful explosion of ornament.
The 14-year-old Jude took one look at that and said, “Man, do I want a part of this.”
Of course, I had been fooled by album art before—Motörhead also had some great album covers—so I harbored skepticism. The name also gave me pause. “Funeral” could easily be another cheerfully dark metal-style name or emo self-indulgence. When I put it on, I was ready to be disappointed.
I was not disappointed.
Of course, the name “Funeral” wasn’t just a cheap emotional grab. Four out of six Arcade Fire band members had seen the deaths of loved ones during the album’s production. This was an album with grief—real grief, not cheap melodrama. Even I could recognize the real thing at the age of 14.
This was Arcade Fire’s great genius: conveying real sorrow and alienation without becoming ridiculous. If Big Star conveyed the ideal of American adolescence—who doesn’t want to be the singer-protagonist of “Thirteen”?—Arcade Fire conveyed its real experience. In the album’s first song, “Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels),” the fantastic world of a snowy apocalypse is presented to the listener, but what is highlighted is the peculiar ennobling loneliness of every high school romance: “You climb out the chimney / And meet me in the middle / The middle of the town / And since there's no one else around / We let our hair grow long / And forget all we used to know... You change all the lead / Sleeping in my head to gold / As the day grows dim / I hear you sing a golden hymn / It’s the song I’ve been trying to sing.”
This counterpoint between suburban images and personal fantasy runs through all the songs. “Neighborhood #2 (Laïka)” imagines the loneliness of the suburban child through the lens of the Soviet space-dog. “Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)” returns to the icy wasteland of “Neighborhood #1,” with a darker, more sinister touch: “I woke up with the power out / Not really something to shout about / Ice has covered up my parents' hands / Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans.” One of the album’s great strengths is this consistent shared image and metaphor; indeed, for some years, I thought that “Funeral” was intended to be a concept album about a snowstorm apocalypse. This thematic unity is strengthened by the musical arrangements, which, although coherent and similar, never become monotonous, and themselves are well-suited to the lyrical content: xylophones and pianos dance over driving bass and rhythm guitars, allowing a song’s tone to jump from sweet to wistful to impassioned at the drop of a hat. I had never found that sort of subtlety in a rock band before.
Yet Arcade Fire isn’t a one-trick pony; they aren’t restricted by their musical conceits. The B-side opens with the rocking, hollow piano of “Crown of Love.” They use a very different musical setting to convey the familiar theme of loneliness, here in the context of a break-up: “They say it fades if you let it / Love was made to forget it / I carved your name across my eyelids / You pray for rain; I pray for blindness.” “Wake Up,” probably the most widely known song from the album, brings guitars to the front of the orchestration, weaving a hard-driving line that would have made Jimmy Page proud and matching the frustration of the verses: “Something filled up / My heart with nothing / Someone told me not to cry / But now that I'm older / My heart's colder / And I can see that it's a lie.” If the A-side proves that the band can do anything with one sort of arrangement, the B-side proves that they can do anything with any other arrangement, too, while never departing from the essential recognizability of the album and its central thematic tenets.
It was a lot to take in for a 14-year-old who had never listened to much of anything besides classical music and Talking Heads. The first time I heard it, I played the album three times in a row. I’ve listened to it at nearly every important juncture in my life since, and in a lot of the times in between.
So maybe I find it a little sad that the 10-year anniversary of “Funeral” passed with little notice. Even so, it seems somehow appropriate that an album based on alienation and subtlety should escape wider notice. It will continue to do what it always does: inspire the individual who hears it, regardless of who else is listening or paying attention.

“You’re Dead!” proclaims Flying Lotus with the title of his new album. For those with only a passing familiarity with Steven Ellison, the man behind Flying Lotus, the album’s menacing title immediately calls to mind a certain belligerence—especially when considered within the context of Ellison’s hip-hop roots. Someone picking this album up off the shelf will expect cocky, swaggering rap. But Ellison’s new album seems much more a meditation on death than a celebration of it—and, on this front, the album succeeds with aplomb.
In the same vein as Flying Lotus’s 2010 album, “Cosmogrammica,” “You’re Dead!” is a cohesive concept album—each song flows seamlessly into the next, creating a complex suite that somehow melds together despite Ellison’s schizophrenic variety of musical interests. Ellison’s style is highly complex and syncretic, drawing from jazz, electronica, old-school rap, new-school rap, and classic 8-bit sound, but his meticulous attention to each one somehow forces these disparate elements into a chilling whole. Ellison carefully builds each of his compositions from the ground up, deftly layering sound atop sound in a way that lets each musical element breathe and build upon its fellows. Nothing gets lost, nothing gets muddled—unless Ellison wants it to. But, for the most part, his pieces are remarkably lucid—cogently constructing each soundscape with a meticulous attention to detail and a respect for the unique qualities of each sound. This carefulness pays off on “Ready Err Not,” which starts with a simple, clopping 8-bit beat, stark in its simplicity. Ellison lets it play unfettered for a few seconds and then proceeds to add small bits of warbling, melancholic synth, periodically pausing to reveal the original beat underneath. As the song progresses, he adds more and more to the song, weaving a bleak melody that never lets you forget its origins.
Just as Ellison weaves songs out of sounds, so he weaves a suite out of individual songs. The album plays like a symphony, each song a movement. We see the skillful repetition of musical motifs within the album—there are quick chromatic saxophone licks that feature prominently on tracks like “Tesla,” “Cold Dead,” and “Moment of Hesitation.” “Siren Song,” “Turtles,” and “Obligatory Cadence” sample haunting female voices that provide the sonic background. “Ready Err Not” and “Dead Man’s Tetris” are steeped in video-game sound, with “Dead Man’s Tetris” going so far as to sample the original Tetris theme, which pulsates behind a carefully constructed cacophony of voices. But it’s not as though there are discrete categories that each song can be sorted into—these elements and other characteristics are woven into every track. Different themes are emphasized for different compositions, but most of the songs draw from the same wells in varying amounts. Sonically, this album is incredibly eclectic, but it’s consistent in its bases, giving “You’re Dead!” a remarkable unity.
Despite this unity of form, there are a few standouts in the album. In “Dead Man’s Tetris,” featuring Snoop Dogg and Ellison’s own rapper-alter-ego Captain Murphy, Ellison uses Snoop Dogg’s distinctive drawl as yet another sound in his repertoire to create a chaotic wall of sound that engulfs the listener. The mechanical vocals, whispers, screams, and gunshots in the background, combined with the austerity of the robotic voices and stark electronic beats commanding the foreground, creates a very real tension throughout the composition. Another standout is the slick “Never Catch Me,” which heavily features Kendrick Lamar’s signature manic vocals combined with a low-key, piano-based beat. The urgency and breathless nature of Kendrick’s rap melds with the cool piano lick to create a sensation of pursuer and pursued—and produces an image of a futile flight from death.
But many of Ellison’s solo tracks match his collaborative efforts in quality. “Coronus, the Terminator,” with its pulsating inevitability, celestial choral vocals, and fine R&B sensitivity, seems to radiate power in a calm yet utterly menacing way. “Cold Dead” is a clever vintage rock-jazz track, starting with a muddled guitar riff and melding it with stunning jazz lines. The song seems to breathe, almost, alternating high-speed, grungy guitar riffs with almost ethereal, fragile saxophone solos. “The Boys Who Died in Their Sleep,” which also features Ellison as Captain Murphy, has haunting, ethereal, spaced-out falsetto vocals backed by a low, menacing chorus. The song crescendos and decrescendos, accelerates and decelerates to produce an eerie, shape-shifting composition that never quite puts the listener at ease.
Ellison’s unity of subject and sound does contribute to a homogeneous mood within the album—it’s never triumphant, never elated—that’s pensive at its most optimistic and terrified at its least. But there’s not a piece on here that could in good conscience be called weak. The cohesion of this album, its stunning control and execution, musical eclecticism, and unflagging song strength make “You’re Dead!” a standout addition to Flying Lotus’s already-impressive catalogue and cements him as one of the premier voices in modern electronica.

In short, “Our Love” is an emotional masterpiece. On the album, Caribou’s Dan Snaith has perfected his own unique sound—melancholic, hypnotic beats designed to emotionally resonate within the listener as much as it would make them dance.
If Caribou’s 2010 release, “Swim,” was designed to make us experience heartbreak, “Our Love” is its direct successor—we are overcoming that feeling of loneliness found in the lead single off of “Swim,” “Odessa”: “She's tired of cryin' and sick of his lies / She's suffered him for far too many years of her life.” Instead, on “Our Love,” we are given the sequential tale of redemption and find closure. Yet this tale of closure isn’t as satisfying as one would hope; on his latest, Snaith continues to ask the hard-hitting, emotionally decisive questions that he posed on “Swim.” On “Silver,” he pleads, “It doesn't mean I can't get over her / Where you gonna go without me tonight? / Don't you know what that means to me?”
But thematically, “Our Love” begins where “Swim” left off. On 2011’s “Leave House,” Snaith expressed how he feels about his counterpart’s inability to reciprocate feelings for him, wailing, "She can't see how / It can make her happy / And I can see / She's says she's gone forward." But on “Our Love,” in an appropriately titled “Back Home,” Snaith now expresses new feelings of indignity and sings in response, “I can't take it / The way you treat me wrong / It's not right girl / There's something going on.” On “Our Love,” we see a Snaith who no longer focuses on the hardships of his life; instead, he focuses on his ability to come out stronger from these experiences. In the last couple of years, Snaith has undergone many difficult experiences, ascribing the underlying to his album to many personal losses. Dan Snaith writes, “I have friends who are struggling to keep their relationships together, I’ve lost people close to me; in fact, one of the songs on the album is dedicated to our sound engineer, who passed away in the final months of making the record.” But throughout it all, the music on “Our Love” remains euphoric and joyous as ever, a mark of celebration of Snaith’s ability to find positivity in his experiences.
By the final track on “Our Love,” “Your Love Will Set You Free,” Snaith no longer lingers in the deep, dark crevices of his love. Amidst heart-throbbing basslines, funky guitar licks, and a jazzy, Latin-influenced synth melody, Snaith confides, “You are here beside me in my bedroom / All night dear / Hold each other like I never met you / Your love will set you free.” He seems to know that his love for others will never end, even if the love will never be reciprocated in his favor.
Ultimately, Caribou’s latest is a relatable album. After a thorough listen-through of “Our Love,” one can’t help but feel that Dan Snaith is undergoing something that we have all felt at some point in our own lives. He finds closure not in the end of a relationship but in the realization that humans are destined to forever love and cherish the experience of a relationship—even if it means going back to the ones we have just lost. It’s not something easy to admit.
With “Our Love,” Snaith expresses his honesty through some of the most danceable, grooviest beats and rhythms of his whole career, enough to leave a casual listener without any notion of some of his most open, expressive work. It’s hard to capture the deep emotional themes of the album when being compelled to dance to an array of hypnotic rhythms from two-step garage beats on “Julia Brightly” to a half-time, trip-hop influenced “Dive” to the title track “Our Love,” a synthpop anthem driven by mountainous layers of acid house synths and drum patterns.
But “Our Love,” despite its deep and melancholic production, still manages to provide us with a rich, euphoric message of passion. In his pursuit of love, Dan Snaith remains reserved, subtle, and soulful in his music. On the album’s spellbinding opener, “Can’t Do without You,” Dan Snaith’s vocals echo the track’s title over and over, a testament to his inability to let go of love. In an interview earlier this year, he addressed his thoughts on what love is: “It's functional and dysfunctional at the same time.” Snaith has come to accept the irrationality of love, remarking on “Our Love” that the sooner we all come to accept love for what it is, the sooner we will all be set free.

The year is 1994, and “Weezer,” one of the most iconic albums of the 1990s, has just been released. Also known as “The Blue Album,” “Weezer” was inspired by the personal experiences of the lead singer, guitarist, and principal songwriter for the band, Rivers Cuomo.  Musically, “The Blue Album” was characterized by distinctive mellow moods that built into angstier metallic refrains as well as its indie flair. Still, there is no doubt that what truly made the album such a commercial success was Cuomo’s ability to relate a unique persona to his audience. The character of a geeky teenage misfit battling life, lost in the mindlessness of California, combined with the musical blend of mellow and metal is what established Weezer as a unique, alternative rock band of its time. But on Weezer’s second album, “Pinkerton,” Cuomo no longer wrote songs about being a geeky misfit, but rather about falling in love with Harvard girls and Asian fangirls. Though “Pinkerton” was met with some critical acclaim, its thematic inaccessibility made it a commercial failure. Feeling pressure to adapt his sound to the changing musical trends, Cuomo changed the band’s direction, shifting Weezer’s musical style towards pop and away from the beloved indie alternative rock band that Weezer was.
But on Weezer’s latest album, “Everything Will Be Alright in the End,” Cuomo chooses to return to his pre-“Pinkerton” sound, even bringing back producer Ric Ocasek, who also produced the band’s debut. Though there are still some songs on the new album that resemble Weezer’s poppier sound, such as “Go Away,” the album generally harkens back to Weezer’s old style. On “Back to the Shack,” Cuomo addresses this reversion directly, apologizing to his fans, “Sorry guys, I didn’t realize that I needed you so much. / I thought I’d get a new audience. I forgot that disco sucked. / I ended up with nobody and I started feeling dumb.” The song is the story of Cuomo’s own career and his erroneous venture away from his initial style that felt so natural on “The Blue Album.”
Yet, no song on the album better portrays Cuomo’s desire to bring back alternative rock than “The British Are Coming.” The track begins with a speech that emphasizes a duty to return to their earlier sound: “Welcome to the first-level literati. Our mission is to keep the tradition alive. It’s up to us. It’s our responsibility. Who else is going to do it?” A ringing clock tower and army drumming in “The British Are Coming” and a female voice in “Da Vinci” are very reminiscent of the signature background conversation throughout 1994’s “Undone – The Sweater Song.” But here, Cuomo’s usage of background noise seems to be an afterthought rather than the focus of the track. Whereas in “Undone – The Sweater Song,” the conversation is cleverly woven into the song, these two recent tracks use them merely as openers to the track.
“Da Vinci” also captures Weezer’s traditional blend of mellow rock and metal, making it one of the most memorable tracks on “Everything Will Be Alright in the End.” But despite the general direction towards their earlier sound, Weezer still explores unfamiliar territory. Deviating from the band’s traditional formula, “Da Vinci” introduces a more peppy and happy tone before progressing into the angstier, metal refrain.
Still, “Everything Will Be Alright in the End” is by no means as good as Weezer’s debut. The themes of Weezer’s new album revolve around apologies to Cuomo’s fans for succumbing to mainstream pop and promising to repopularize rock. Yet what made “The Blue Album” so successful was not purely its musical attributes but also its unique thematic character, which not only set it apart from other alternative rock bands of the time, but also resonated among the masses, leading to its popularity.
This relatable character is missing from Weezer’s latest, with the sole exception of “Foolish Father,” a touching song about forgiveness. “Foolish Father” provides a reason to believe that Weezer has found its new edge; the concept of a father asking for forgiveness from his daughter is something that the world can relate to. Perhaps it is true that Cuomo can no longer write about being a geeky teenage misfit because the truth is, he is no longer that lost kid he was back in 1994. However, this does not mean that Cuomo as an artist has nothing left to give. “Everything Will Be Alright in the End” is Cuomo’s attempt to redefine not only Weezer but also who he is and what he has to say.

“Most people in the industry talk about making films like this but they don’t do it,” said Michael Cuesta, the director of the upcoming political thriller “Kill the Messenger.” On Sept. 29, the man at the helm of this greatly anticipated movie sat down for a Q&A roundtable in downtown Boston as a part of the press junket for the film.
Michael Cuesta’s career in film took off with his directorial debut, a 2001 independent film titled “L.I.E.” The film was met with critical acclaim and led to Cuesta becoming a regular director on the HBO series, “Six Feet Under.” Interestingly enough, Michael Cuesta is perhaps better known for his work in television than the silver screen. Cuesta has directed episodes of the Showtime series “Dexter,” the HBO series “True Blood,” and the CBS dramas “Blue Bloods” and “Elementary.” Chief among his work in television however is “Homeland.” Cuesta directed the pilot episode of the Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe darling that runs on Showtime. Cuesta also serves as an executive producer of the political thriller. “I’ve always treated pilots like a mini movie. As far as how you tell the story, I find that a lot of TV is too obvious. And the things that feel too cliché and obvious, I try to strip away in television,” said Cuesta. Cuesta makes a living pushing the envelope and constantly delving into projects that investigate the harsh realities of the world around us. Whether it is CIA operations in the Middle East in “Homeland,” or government corruption in “Kill the Messenger,” Cuesta does not settle for easy topics.
Written by Peter Landesman, who adapted the script from Nick Schou’s “Kill the Messenger” and Gary Webb’s own “Dark Alliance,” “Kill the Messenger” is an emotionally-charged thriller starring Jeremy Renner, Rosemarie DeWitt, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The film adds on an incredible supporting cast that includes Michael Sheen, Paz Vaga, Andy Garcia, and Ray Liotta. Set in the 1990's, the film traces the unbelievable true story of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Gary Webb of the San Jose Mercury News (Renner). Thanks to a tip from Coral Baca (Vaga), Webb becomes increasingly immersed in a potentially career-altering story. The story begins to weave a trail that leads to the CIA knowingly facilitating the cocaine epidemic in the United States by allowing cocaine to pass through U.S. borders from Latin America. Even more nefariously, the government is using the profits to fund contra rebels fighting in Nicaragua. Webb quickly becomes knee deep in a conspiracy that has the potential to threaten not only his professional career, but also his family and even his life. Webb then must decide: at what cost is he willing to expose the truth?
It is clear that at the heart of the movie is a spectacular supporting cast. With a story that does not have any glitzy CGI or massive stunts, much of the pressure falls squarely on the shoulders of the actors. “I’m lucky,” said Cuesta. “When you make a movie, you are as good as your cast. Luckily this movie was not that hard to cast. Each role is super important to Webb’s investigation and his journey. There were no cameos. Every character played an integral part in the journey of Webb and his investigation. All the actors knew that they were going to have their moment.”
Even though this movie is a political thriller, at its core, “Kill the Messenger” is a story about the familial support that can save so many people from the abyss. “His family was his rock. Gary loved them so much. So much of the story resonates back to the complexities of being a father and being on the road a lot, even though he was doing important work,” said Cuesta. Later in the story, as Gary’s world begins to crumble down around him, his family is lost along the way. “And I think that it was a huge part of his downfall. Without him losing his family, this wouldn’t have been the story that we told. He wouldn’t have fallen as far,” added Cuesta.
Given the nature of the film, Cuesta mentioned how the amount of research required to make the movie was quite exhaustive. “Most of the homework revolved around finding all of the newspaper articles about Gary. The ‘LA Times’ were the hardest to dig up. There were so many about Gary to sift through. Then I had to know him by talking to his wife. I got to know what he was like at home. Finding out about him as a beat writer, that was easy. But my job was to color his character with more human nuances and fallibilities,” said Cuesta.
Cuesta ended by posing some very incisive observations about the modern society that we live in.  What he said is not comforting, but essential nonetheless.  “You’re guilty before being proven innocent now,” said Cuesta. “There’s an outpouring of negativity. You can’t do anything in the public forum without it being torn apart. The story got lost. They made him the story.”

Reading Jane Smiley’s new novel, “Some Luck,” one becomes increasingly aware of a simple truth about time: all of history was once the present, and the present will one day be history. Of course, this is a fact one knows in theory, but to make someone truly grasp the concept and its implications is not a trivial undertaking. Textbooks teach the problems of history, but Smiley’s novel aims to convey the full extent of the past’s relationship to the present and to the future, without which one is likely to underestimate the import of today’s problems. Unfortunately, the novel’s very success in this endeavor comes at a cost: in moving through history gradually while preserving a sense of history as a whole, the narrative winds up being boring and dispassionate at times. It’s hard to say whether these faults are unavoidable, but the final product is certainly compelling and original, enough so that readers who stick with the book will be rewarded.
Smiley is the author of many well-received books, most notably the novel “A Thousand Acres,” a modern retelling of King Lear for which she won the Pulitzer Prize. As one would expect from this author, “Some Luck” is peopled with interesting and varied characters who share complex relationships. The novel’s third-person narrative has access to the minds of all the main characters, young and old, and as babies they already have unique personalities. The reader watches the characters grow up in remarkably believable ways and has the unique privilege of sometimes remembering things about a character that they don’t even recall themselves.
At the sentence level as well, the book is elegantly written. The narrator doesn’t dwell on sensory details, but what little there is packs a punch: “pale-apricot stone buildings” and leaves that “were the brightest green in the world, maybe in the universe—flat and waxy and full of themselves.” But “Some Luck” is perhaps most successful on the level of structure—this may be a case where the premise of the book surpasses its content. “Some Luck” is meant to be the first of three books in “The Last Hundred Years Trilogy” and takes the reader from 1920 to 1953. The trilogy will span a century and extend into the future, to the year 2020. The narrative follows the Langdon family through the generations, and, though many characters grow up and move away to start their own families, they retain their ties with the Langdon’s farm in Iowa.
The novel’s premise is its great strength, but it is also the source of various weaknesses. For instance, in reducing history to a series of present moments, the novel ends up progressing slowly at times. Most of the narration focuses on mundane activities like preparing meals, harvesting corn, and walking to school. Even when the story follows one of the Langdons onto the battlefields of World War II, the tone doesn’t shift from slow, methodical depictions of routine. Yes, this is an accurate representation of reality; even in war, a soldier is simply continuing to live his life, one day at a time. But accuracy and philosophy aside, the book is at times simply boring.
Another side effect of the novel’s structure is that much of the romance of time’s passing is lost. The years come and go with such a pragmatic realism that there is little room for the emotional realism fiction can provide—few waves of nostalgia or recognition of one’s own mortality—which one might expect to be par for the course in a book centered around the passing of time. This isn’t because Smiley looks down on emotion: there are moments when a character reminisces about an earlier moment in the book, and the narration appears meant to elicit nostalgia. The reason these attempts fall flat is that the novel has already committed to an accurate portrayal of the passage of time. Though the novel traverses many years, it does so slowly and continuously enough that each new moment feels like the present. And yet, the reader has at each moment, on every page, access to the whole of the story. It is in this way—by making us aware simultaneously of the present and the whole—that the book elucidates the continuity of time. But it is also for this reason that the reader isn’t as susceptible to the emotion a character feels looking back on his lifetime.
Adding to this deficit of emotion, the characters can feel distant and even difficult to connect to at times. For example, Frank, the oldest of the Langdon children, is almost as mysterious to the reader as he is to his family and friends. Smiley reveals who he hates and who he loves but doesn’t let the reader get close enough to understand why. His mother, Rosanna, looks to religion for emotional stability, but precisely how it provides solace isn’t always clear. This distance from the characters is a palpable loss, but it also makes its contribution to the novel’s cause. Because the members of the Langdon family are held at arm’s length, the reader becomes close to the family as a whole over any one of its members.
By the end of the novel, it’s hard not to want to know what happens to the next generation of Langdons. Even more exciting is the prospect of them and their children and grandchildren intersecting with 2014 and then progressing beyond it. If Smiley adheres to the rhythm she sets in “Some Luck,” history will become the present very gradually, so that the reader will hardly notice how many years the novel is traversing. This is different from the thrill of, say, reading a love letter written 50 years ago, which is titillating precisely because of the gaping stretch of time the letter bridges. Smiley’s approach to historical narrative is, rather, astonishing in its utter normality. One questions whether the novel could have painted a similar portrait of history without losing a sense of nostalgia and a personal emotional stake in the character’s lives. But insofar as the book’s flaws are a necessary consequence of this portrayal of history, ultimately it seems worth the cost.

The world jolts, and suddenly its people turn their eyes to the news. During the Boston Marathon bombings, Hurricane Katrina, the World Trade Center attacks, and so on, we trusted journalists—another type of first responders—to inform us.
The argument almost goes without saying. The free flow of knowledge allows citizens to make informed decisions, to be politically aware, and to hold their representatives accountable. It provides for security as well as justice. To know to evacuate a city or to stay inside our homes until further notice, to know the description of a violent person or the description of a missing victim, we rely on the news. To see political corruption, financial collapse, or protest thousands of miles from our homes, again, we rely on the news.
But when we think of the news, the press, and the media, we see them in the abstract—as institutions rather than as individual men and women. This summer, we were reminded of reality.
The deaths of James W. Foley and Steven J. Sotloff should teach us the great debt we owe to journalists: Their shocking, undeserved executions show us that the information journalists provide us comes at a grave cost. Journalists who have put their lives on the line are nothing less than heroes.
If the press is an entity necessary for a just world and the journalist is the agent of that entity, the journalist should garner the utmost respect. Journalists make it their mission to expose information for the good of the public, at a great risk. Foley’s mother, after the Islamic State released footage of his death, wrote, “We have never been prouder of our son… He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.” Sotloff’s sister saw her brother much the same way. In a letter to him, she said, “You are my hero because you learned to write and had your voice heard.” These fallen journalists worked so that the world could see what was happening on the ground in Syria. That work, in a foul twist of fate, took their lives as they became not only observers but also victims of the conflict they sought to expose.
Sotloff wrote for Foreign Policy, “The civilians of Aleppo are trapped in a violent stalemate, left to endure a war whose suffering and hardships grow larger with every passing day. ... [P]eople in Aleppo fear they are stage players in a war with no end in sight.” If Sotloff and Foley are understood only as pawns in the Islamic State’s sick game and not as sources of investigative journalism to be read and admired, then they too become stage players in the Syrian conflict much like the people of Aleppo.
As homage to Foley and Sotloff, then, and in recognition of the great value of their sacrifice, it’s important to just look at the difference their work made. Foley, providing a key insight into American involvement abroad, discovered correspondence that showed cooperation between the CIA and Gaddafi. After being captured in Libya and then released, Foley returned to the field to film the Syrian Army’s assault on its citizens. Sotloff’s powerful narrative voice described the anguish of Libyan rebels about to face Gaddafi’s forces, and adversaries uniting to defend democratic elections.
Every day, journalists risk their lives in order to protect the values that we hold dear. They stand with the people of Aleppo, the victims of Katrina, and with the firemen of New York. They cover riots in Hong Kong, Ebola outbreaks in Western Africa, and shootings here at home. A soldier sacrifices the peace of mind that most enjoy—that there are not constant, immediate threats to their life. Journalists like Foley and Sotloff make that same sacrifice. For that, they are heroes, and I thank them.

“I feel what only I can feel/and if that don’t appeal to you let me know, and I’ll go, /cuz I flow better when my colors show.”
-Avril Lavigne, 2002
A few weekends ago, I was hanging out with my best friends on campus. One of them posed a question to the group: “What was the hardest thing for you all growing up?” The resulting conversation was important. After all, it isn’t often that we really talk about our pasts here.
Elementary school was pretending to be international spies, smiling with orange wedges between my teeth at soccer games, and lying in my bed and listening to the Avril Lavigne CD I stole from my sister.
At times, that self is still my favorite kind of me. I said my prayers for world peace every night. I knew that I wanted to be a beret-wearing artist in Paris when I grew up. The Avril Lavigne lyric, “I’m not the milk and cheerios in your spoon,” totally and completely resonated with me. (Sidenote: I now have no idea what Avril’s talking about there)
I often feel like I’ve declined since then, just like the quality of Avril Lavigne’s music. Perhaps the perfect illustration is a line from a song off of her latest album: “It’s gonna be a bitchin’ summer/We’ll be livin’ fast, kickin’ ass together.” I’m sorry, Avril, but what happened to your anthem of individuality, “Nobody’s Fool,” or your ever-real, ever-relevant  “Complicated”?
We love to indulge ourselves a look into our pasts. Everybody’s game for a good #tbt, especially if it’s a childhood photo where you’re doing something dysfunctional and Fisher Price is involved. We even like to make current events look old–any college photo album from a disposable camera is automatically much cooler than my album of iOS uploads. Reminiscing makes us happy. A 2008 Psychological Science study asserts that nostalgia helps to increase our perceptions of social support. And in college, our need for social support seems to be at an all-time high.
Most of us lived about eighteen years away from Harvard before we arrived on this campus. But, once we get here, Harvard becomes a huge part of our lives. Our identities here are almost completely defined by the ways in which we spend our time in Cambridge.
At school, I feel as if I’m constantly losing parts of the person I was for those eighteen years before I came here. We haven’t known each other since the beginning. We might know about each others’ high school friends and sports teams, but I can’t say that I know much about the elementary school days of even my closest friends.
Sometimes, I long for the time when I didn’t have to explain who I was to anyone. When I am at school, I miss the friends from my hometown who remember the three-year period of my life when I was routinely mistaken for a boy. I miss the time when most of my friends knew what my parents looked like and didn’t ask me, “So, what are you?” We post #tbts to affirm the continuity of our identity from childhood until now. That little kid is still a part of who I am, even though no one at Harvard knew me at the beginning of my (ongoing) obsession with Avril’s debut album.
The process of conveying one’s history to someone else is special–it allows us to reaffirm the important moments from the past that make us who we are, and it gives us the chance to convey an identity deeper than our Harvard selves.
Let’s investigate beyond the photos we post on Instagram. Maybe it will help us understand each other a little better. Plus, it’s always nice to remind myself of the days when the combination of midterms and constant access to Marshmallow Mateys was still foreign to me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, death threats were emailed out to several hundred Harvard affiliates. In particular, the email targeted Asian Americans, and threatened that the author would come to Harvard on Saturday to “shoot all of you.” On Saturday, a second email was sent, apologizing for the first and requesting that media reporting of the threats stop. HUPD responded by increasing its presence on campus and disseminating its Active Shooter Safety Guidelines, though it concluded that the threat, which appears to have originated overseas, may not be credible.
Harvard is remarkably resilient, but even as campus moves past the emails, it is important to recognize their effect. Regardless of the credibility of this specific threat, we must recognize that they reflect a very real current of racism that is unfortunately alive and well in our world today. The horrifying email was not unique in its underlying message of base and unfounded hatred, and expresses sentiments that many students have had to encounter. The fact that this threat comes at the weekend when various Asian cultural organizations on campus had planned to co-host an event discussing the Asian-American experience at Harvard, and soon after a feature on the subject in The Crimson, serves as a frightening reminder that even in the midst of attempts to bring light to a topic not often discussed, there are those who will seek to silence others.
It is unfortunately true that shootings and violence on campuses across the country are not uncommon, and threats must be taken seriously. HUPD should be commended for its quick and steady response, keeping students informed and offering extra security throughout the weekend.
Words are not just words. When they are directed to a specific group from an anonymous source, and draw from real experiences that individuals have had to undergo, they have a significant effect, one that we should take very seriously. And as we as a campus move forward from the horrifying events of this past weekend, we should take a moment to recognize the important work that student activists on campus are doing in bringing the discussion of Asian American experiences to light.

Last week, the Palestine Solidarity Committee hosted a “die-in” on the Science Center plaza. Held to grieve the Palestinians who perished in Israel’s summer offensive against Hamas, the action generated considerable debate. In an editorial, The Crimson endorsed the protest and treated Israel and Hamas as moral equivalents. For those of us who love the Jewish state, this was a painful article to read. Fatuous in its comparisons, puerile in its notions of ethics, it was an ill-advised piece.
The human toll from Israel’s campaign in the Gaza Strip is undeniable. More than 2,000 Palestinian lives—most of them civilians—were lost. Entire neighborhoods were flattened. Hundreds of thousands in the territory were internally displaced. Access to electricity and clean drinking water was imperiled. These are sobering facts, and they should be acknowledged without qualification. That Assad gasses his own people, that ISIS beheads hostages, that Hamas uses Gazans as human-shields—this does nothing to absolve Israel of its own misdeeds. The Jewish state was founded as a liberal democracy and, at its inception, pledged to observe international law and human rights norms. The failure to adopt best practices feels worse when it comes from Israel—a nation with a prophetic, universal mission—than from Hamas—a terrorist organization that calls for a second Holocaust.
Some Israeli actions elude explanation. Airstrikes destroyed a plant that supplied most of the Strip’s power. Bombs were inadvertently dropped on children at play. On the ground, troops sometimes appeared trigger-happy.
Though wanting, steps the Jewish state took to protect Gazans and provide basic goods were credible. It agreed to a series of humanitarian ceasefires, shipped food and medical supplies into the territory, and usually warned residents before their homes came under attack. In asymmetrical warfare, the most difficult task is to distinguish between civilian and combatant. When the enemy tries to obscure those differences–hiding weapons caches in schools, encouraging civilians to put themselves in harm’s way, planning military operations in private homes–the challenge becomes ever more arduous.
This summer, Israel had no choice but to act. The kidnapping and murder of three Jewish teens by Hamas members, the rocket-fire that rained down on the country–this demanded that something be done. Amos Oz, the father of the Israeli peace movement, summed up the conundrum this way: “What would you do if your neighbor across the street sits down on the balcony, puts his little boy on his lap and starts shooting machine gun fire into your nursery?”
While that question is a valid one, it moves us nowhere. Whether Oz intends it or not, his analogy distracts from the reality of power relations between Israeli and Palestinian. The Palestinian is not the Israeli’s neighbor, but instead the Israeli’s detainee, held in an existential–as well as a physical–prison. For almost half-a-century, millions of Palestinians have lived under a military occupation of some form or another. To speak of the Jewish state’s summer campaign alone is to ignore the legacy of structural violence of which this episode makes a part. If Gazans had not been kept immiserated by a seven-year blockade, if the current Israeli government had been willing to make the sacrifices necessary for a just and durable peace, the quandary that Oz raises would have been moot. Hamas is the sort of demon conjured by a liberal society in its witching hour. With enough psychic energy—and political will—it can be vanquished.
Today, both appear lacking. Why, then, not join the PSC on the Science Center plaza?  It is important that such protests happen, and that there is a global movement to boycott, divest from, and place sanctions on the Jewish state. Israelis must be reminded that the status quo will have costs. At the same time, the Jewish national project is redeemable. PSC doesn’t think so. That demonstration was as much about ostracizing Israel as an end in itself as it was about grieving Palestinian deaths and ending the occupation. As with much activism, the group’s event was agit-prop. The names of civilians and combatants were mingled without disclaimer. Buzzwords like “massacre” were used. We shouldn’t expect better from the PSC. But we should expect better from the Harvard community, and especially from University administrators and faculty.
For those who care about Israel, now is not the time to isolate our friends across the sea. It is a time to talk and listen, encourage and understand. Closing one of his speeches on Judaism, the philosopher Martin Buber told a story worth recounting here. Still a child, he encountered this proposition: “Outside the gates of Rome,” it read, “there sits a leprous beggar, waiting. He is the Messiah.” Who, the boy wondered, does the Messiah await? Us.

UPDATED: October 6, 2014, at 10:40 p.m.
Harvard Tech Hub, the computer and repair service store on the lower level of the Science Center, is set to close Oct. 17, with online sales closing Oct. 28, as Harvard University Information Technology phases out its Technology Products and Services branch.
University Chief Information Officer Anne Margulies detailed the decision to employees in an email last Wednesday and also spoke to TPS employees in person. In the email shared with The Crimson by a recipient, Margulies pointed to the impact that a changing computer sales market has had upon TPS as the motivating factor behind the decision.
“The computer sales marketplace has shifted dramatically in recent years, and we are no longer able to cover the expenses associated with operating our own physical and online stores,” Margulies wrote.
Despite what she said she saw as tireless efforts on the part of the staff to increase sales and broaden services, Margulies wrote that TPS sales and repair locations will close by Oct. 31 and the employees affected will be provided a “full range of Harvard’s transitional services, including individual support and job search assistance.”
HUIT spokesperson Kevin Donovan said that the closing of TPS impacts 18 employees, none of whom are students. Donovan also said that the 25-year-old division had been operating at a loss since the 2010 fiscal year.
“Clearly the marketplace for purchasing computer and other devices has changed dramatically in recent years, given that there were many places for people to purchase devices online and in stores other than the Tech Hub and given the fact that discounts that were previously only available on campus were being offered off campus,” Donnovan said.
Donnovan added that discussions are still in the works about providing students access to hardware and software, and that repair services will now be at the discretion of each of the University’s schools and other units.
The Tech Hub will continue to accept returns until Oct. 30 and does not plan to restock items once they run out.
In addition to selling computers and accessories, TPS was partnered with Computer Loft and Tech Computers Inc., both repair companies, to provide warranties and repair services. The Tech Hub also offered loaned computers and adapters to students, faculty, and staff who sent off a product for repair.

As pointed dialogue about climate change takes place both on and off campus, the Harvard Forest Seminar Series this semester seeks to engage students and the public in discussion on environmental issues.
Hosted most Fridays during the fall semester, the series covers issues ranging from “forest-climate interactions in an era of global change” to “diversity patterns in epiphytic lichens.” Seminars take place at the Fisher Museum, located on the forest grounds, and are also streamed online.
“Many of the topics would be germane to what students are learning in class and elsewhere,” said David A. Orwig, a senior ecologist at the Harvard Forest.
Visiting experts from both American and international universities speak at the seminars, maintaining the Forest’s connection to larger environmental and ecological academic communities. Many of the speakers hold the Harvard Bullard Fellowship in Forest Research.
“[The seminar series] is an extension of the educational mission that is part of Harvard Forest as well,” said Audrey Barker Plotkin, who has run the series since 1999. “That [educational mission] includes many different groups, from students—you would imagine the seminars would appeal to undergraduate and graduate students—[to] informed community members.”
“It’s a great way to keep our great and small science staff plugged into the larger world of ecology and conservation,” Plotkin said.
Located nearly 70 miles away from Harvard Square in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Forest spans more than 3,500 acres and serves as an important site for research in biodiversity studies, conservation and management, and forest-atmosphere exchange. The Forest receives funding from the National Science Foundation.
Beyond the seminar series, undergraduates also engage with the Forest through course and program offerings. During the spring semester, Freshman Seminar 21w: “Research at the Harvard Forest: Global Change Ecology-Forests, Ecosystem Function, the Future” gives 11 freshmen the opportunity to spend multiple weekends at the Forest.
The Forest also offers a week-long program during January Term, when 10 students spend a week living and learning in the field, and an 11-week summer research program.
“I do think it’s important for Harvard students to keep in touch with what’s going on out here,” Orwig said.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School have shed light on the underlying biochemical mechanisms of pancreatic cancer, according to findings published in Cell Reports in late September.
The form of cancer examined in the study stands as one of the most lethal in the country.
“Pancreatic cancer typically has a five-year survival rate of 6 percent,” said David T. Ting, the lead author of the article and an assistant professor at the Medical School. “A lot of the reason for that is its relatively quick spread and the lack of early detection methods.”
The project aimed to gain more insight into circulating tumor cells—CTCs—and their role in metastasis, which is the spread of cancer from a primary tumor to the rest of the body. Though previous research has hinted at finding a way to stop metastasis through gene sequencing and analysis, Ting’s study is the first to examine the cell’s microenvironment.
“For a long time, tumors were thought to plant somewhere and find the right soil to grow,” Ting said. “But it looks like in this case, tumor cells may in fact make their own soil—they don’t care where they land, and they can grow wherever they want, which is potentially why they are so hard to treat.”
The study looked specifically at a gene called SPARC, which is thought to play a role in forming the “soil” where CTCs thrive. The researchers found that suppressing SPARC significantly reduced the growth and migration of CTCs. The findings open the door for new research.
Only further investigation can reveal the applications of CTCs and SPARC in a clinical setting. Specialized treatment methods derived from these discoveries could revolutionize the medical field, especially since chemotherapy currently has a success rate of 30 percent in pancreatic cancer, according to Ting.
“I think this is a very important study,” said Alec C. Kimmelman, associate professor of radiation oncology at the Medical School. “It demonstrates the power of a new CTC technology.”
Ting is now overseeing clinical trials at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center that aim to develop a drug that reduces tumor growth by targeting SPARC. He anticipates continuing to pursue research in the field and cited the need for progress.
“Any kind of new therapy is critically important,” Ting said. “To be able to use these findings to eventually develop treatments for all types of cancer—that’s our hope.”

UPDATED: Oct. 7, 2014, at 2:59 a.m.
Scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have developed a new chip that mimics the function of an asthmatic airway and has the potential to speed up the drug-testing process.
Testing a drug often costs more than a billion dollars and has traditionally consisted of a two-part process—the pre-clinical phase of testing on animals and the clinical trial of testing on humans. While many drugs pass through the first phase, they fail when they reach the clinical phase, a crucial component of pharmaceutical research, according to A. Peyton Nesmith, a research assistant at SEAS and the lead author of a paper published in August about the chip.
“You’ve got to test drugs on humans because testing on rats or other animals that are not humans or primates is not sufficient to test the safety of the drug or to test the efficacy—that is, how effective it is at curing a disease,” said Kevin Kit Parker, a bioengineering and applied physics professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who leads the team of scientists at the Wyss Institute.
The scientists at the Wyss Institute may have found a way to eliminate this problem through micro-scale models, the latest of which simulates an asthmatic airway. Each organ-on-a-chip that the team has engineered mimics the function of a human body part on a controlled, small-scale level.
“The idea is that we want to build every organ system—the heart, the lungs, the airway, the liver, all the adrenal organs, and then link them up to hopefully stimulate normal human physiology,” Nesmith said. Nesmith built a model of a normal airway and then triggered asthma in that airway by using human cells and focusing on muscular structure.
“Peyton did something very smart in that he realized that he could get healthy cells from a company, and he could induce the asthmatic phenotype in those cells,” Parker said.
To build the chip, Nesmith assembled very thin glass, polymer, and cell culture layers. Using this process, the team has experimented with different types of cells—including heart, vascular and bronchial cells—and has created organs-on-a-chip since 2003.
“The biggest challenge for organs-on-chips in general is that they need to be consistent,” said Megan L. McCain, a biomedical engineering professor at the University of Southern California who worked on the Wyss Institute’s heart-on-a-chip project.
Researchers must also consider the implications of how working with tiny pieces of engineered tissues rather than full-sized human models might affect how to scale drug dosages, McCain said.
The organ-on-a-chip models involves collaboration across disciplines such as engineering, applied mechanics, and biology.
“When you take a look at a project like this, it’s kind of uniquely Harvard,” Parker said. “A lot of the times to be on the cutting edge, you take things that don’t belong together, and you put them together.”

Though decarbonizing the world economy may be costly, it may prove cheaper than failure to act on climate change, according to Harvard Business School professor Rebecca M. Henderson.
“Building an energy efficient, decarbonized economy is a massive shift,” Henderson wrote in her article recently published in Forbes magazine.
“This won’t be easy, but it will be easier than we expect,” she wrote.
To effectively mobilize the private sector, Henderson wrote that taxing carbon emissions at their externality costs, or the “real cost of dumping them into the atmosphere,” is the most effective policy option.
Governments around the world continue to debate whether non-subsidy approaches to climate change—including cap-and-trade laws and carbon taxes—will promote decarbonization innovation in the private sector.
Henderson noted in her article that key energy technologies suffer from significant learning curves, and other professors suggested that these difficulties can be counteracted by financial incentives.
“Environmental regulation has long accepted that ‘technology-forcing’ laws produce innovation at lower costs than industry often estimates at the outset,” said Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64, professor of science and technology at the Kennedy School of Government.
Experts suggested that only a holistic consideration of the situation will help reduce carbon emissions in the short term and promote renewable energy in the long term.
“The most cost-effective approach will be to incorporate into the price of all energy sources their external, climate-related social costs of generation and use,” said Robert N. Stavins, professor of business and government at the Kennedy School.
Economists agreed that carbon pricing represents a more efficient allocation of resources than subsidy policies.
“The market with the fossil fuel tax would efficiently pick winners and losers at least overall cost,” said Martin L. Weitzman, an economics professor.
“Subsidies force the government to pick winners and losers, a task at which it is not particularly adept,” Weitzman added.
Moving beyond subsidy approaches may also provide the key for energy-efficient innovation in the private sector.
Despite some early road bumps, including Australia’s repeal of a carbon tax in July, there is hope that carbon pricing laws are catching on. California has recently attempted the cap-and-trade approach with passage of Assembly Bill 32.
“It is ambitious, cost-effective, and from what we have seen so far, quite successful,” said Stavins of the bill.

Cambridge-based transportation company Bridj recently completed a week of beta testing that took passengers from Coolidge Corner to Harvard Square, among other routes, and is hoping to more formally establish its innovative busing system here, even as it faces legal obstacles.
Founded by Middlebury College alumnus Matthew George, Bridj is a smart transit system that uses data to produce flexible bus routes. The startup is currently in its beta phase, offering six fixed routes to consumers for fares of $1 to $3.
“The concept is essentially an everyday living, learning, breathing transportation system that connects to make smarter cities,” said Bridj marketing manager Ryan Kelly.
As a middle ground between public and private transportation, Bridj fills the gap in the current transportation system and offers a more cost-effective form of transit, according to Kelly.
“We want to solve that problem and create a more flexible transportation system, conforming to meet your needs instead of you as a consumer having to conform to it,” Kelly said.
The company is using its beta period to monitor transit patterns, so the permanence of future Bridj routes is yet to be determined, Kelly said. Each Bridj vehicle will contain about 13 or more seats and complimentary WiFi. For $3 to $5, customers are guaranteed a reserved seat on a “smart route with fewer stops,” Kelly said.
With a jitney license to operate transportation services from the City of Boston and a temporary permit from Brookline, Bridj is still awaiting approval for a license from Cambridge. An Aug. 20 municipal memorandum, released after Bridj submitted the jitney application, imposed restrictions on the startup, preventing Bridj from using many of its proposed bus stops.
“Cambridge has been more of a challenge, but we think we will be able to work with the city,” said Kelly. “The relationship is ongoing but we are working with them to provide better transportation. Everyone is trying to do best thing for the city…now we’re just waiting to hear back from Cambridge.”
Though some see Bridj as a competitor for established public transportation options, MBTA spokesperson Kelly Smith wrote in an email that the MBTA supports efforts that promote the use of mass transit.
“The MBTA is pleased that their service will make it easier for people to make connections with the MBTA’s rapid transit system. It’s not a competitive situation at all, as their fares are more in line with taxi cab fares,” Smith wrote.
Smith added that the MBTA does not own its bus stops and that it is up to municipalities to determine who may use them.
Though he does not see it replacing the MBTA, Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said that he has heard many positive things about Bridj.
“Everybody is talking about how market solutions need to bring efficiency to transit and how with the advent of Zipcar and even more basic ridesharing services, it’s only natural that Bridj is bringing an effective solution where the public sector is ailing a little bit,” Mazen said.
Others push back on such a comparison. Jose A. Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, said that although he was impressed by the impact that Uber and other ride-sharing services have had, he’s still skeptical of Bridj’s unproven model.
“I think the success is ultimately going to depend on the density of the ridership that they get,” Gomez-Ibanez said. “The MBTA is infrequent and not always reliable, so in that sense [the MBTA is] vulnerable to competition, but on the other hand they charge you a buck and half for a ride and if they stick to their schedule they’re usually a pretty good deal.”
Bridj is currently considering neighborhoods for its future expansion and asking consumers to vote on which stops they would like to see incorporated into the bus routes. Among the locations are Union Square, Central Square, and at least seven other popular destinations.

Following its annual anti-hazing poster campaign, the Office of Student Life plans to organize a student working group to further investigate the issue of hazing on campus.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich said the development of the group is currently in early stages, and the OSL will soon reach out to students and other stakeholders with an opportunity to contribute to the group. Friedrich added that the group will discuss strategies to promote positive and inclusive induction processes, raise awareness, and approach the issue in a way that reflects the values of the Harvard community.
“The most effective approach to campus issues is when students take leadership and help us work to address them,” Friedrich said. “We’re looking forward to partnering with students to continue to develop new ways of addressing the issue and raising awareness.”
Friedrich added that the working group will collaborate with the University Department of Health Promotion and Education, which is comprised of several offices, including the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services.
The proposed working group is the latest in a series of initiatives undertaken by the OSL to combat hazing at Harvard. Friedrich noted that the OSL created a website dedicated to hazing information and resources for the student body several years ago, and the site was recently incorporated into the OSL’s website.
Additionally, leaders of all recognized and unrecognized student organizations—such as club sports teams, Greek organizations, and final clubs—are required to sign a non-hazing attestation form at the beginning of each year.
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, an Undergraduate Council representative for Quincy House who serves on the Campus Safety Committee, said that he has not worked on hazing issues during his time on the Committee.
“I don’t know if that’s because in large part it’s not an issue, or if it’s because it’s something students are experiencing but they’re just not speaking up about,” he said, adding that he is interested to see what the group finds out.
Massachusetts law defines hazing as “any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person.”
Exposés, such as former Dartmouth fraternity member Andrew Lohse’s memoir released in August, have brought campus hazing into the national spotlight in recent years. Friedrich said that “the dangers of hazing require constant attention.”
Biebelberg added that the inclusion of students in working groups dealing with issues of student safety is imperative.
“Without student input, there’s no demonstration of commitment to improving student life,” he said.

UPDATED: October 7, 2014, at 2:45 a.m.
The Harvard Innovation Lab will kick off a competition that will award innovative solutions in the fields of healthcare and the life sciences next Tuesday.
The Health and Life Sciences Challenge is currently seeking teams of students and affiliates to enter for a chance at the $50,000 grand prize. This year's contest features two new focus areas.
“With every year, we try to reevaluate what topics speak to different populations at Harvard,” said Alice Ly, assistant director for Health and Sciences at the i-Lab. “The new topics this year are prevention and safety [and] health information technology and wearable technology, which many students have unique ideas about.”
Ly estimates that only 10 percent of applicants to the challenge are Harvard College students, which could in part be due to a lack of medical experience.
“The students who participate in our challenges are a function of what topics are picked,” said Gordon S. Jones, managing director of the i-Lab. “It’s less frequently that a freshman at Harvard College will have exposure to an operating room.”
Some participants in the challenge will likely arrive with fully-developed ideas, but others will choose their project at the event.
“We have a number of networking events; in November, the pitch mix-and-match event is an opportunity for members of all challenges to see all of the awesome ideas happening around the University,” Ly said. “You can come with an idea without the technical background and connect with people to help further your project.”
With a week remaining until the event, 160 community members and counting have already RSVPed.
Joseph B. Lassiter III, professor of management practice at the Business School, emphasized the accessibility of the event to students at Harvard College.
“Undergraduates should come to the kick-off season and get a feel for the Deans’ Challenge and the i-lab programming around the Deans’ Challenge,” Lassiter said. “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.”
The Challenge, which launched in 2012, will be co-chaired by Jeffrey S. Flier, Dean of Harvard Medical School, and Nitin Nohria, Dean of Harvard Business School.
It is featured as one of four Deans’ challenges, with other topics centering around cultural entrepreneurship, food systems, and innovation in sports.

Madagascar, the world’s fourth largest island, is home to rich biodiversity but some of the poorest people on Earth. Balancing these two extremes has been one of the primary challenges for Patricia C. Wright, a professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University and a leading primatologist, who spoke at Harvard Thursday.
Wright has spent the last three decades of her life working to both protect the island’s remaining rainforests and bring economic development to its human inhabitants.
Wright, a former MacArthur fellow and the first female recipient of the prestigious Indianapolis Prize for her work in conservation, spoke about her experiences with conservation, research, and development in Madagascar at an event organized by the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
Almost 30 years ago, Wright first set foot on Madagascar in search of the greater bamboo lemur, then thought to be extinct. After spending weeks living in a tent and cooking over a fire, Wright and her team took a break at a hotel.
“Little did I know that getting a hot bath was going to lead to changing my whole life,” she said.
Behind that hotel was “one of the most beautiful rainforests I’d ever seen,” Wright said, and inside it, after several weeks of observation, the research team found live specimens of the greater bamboo lemur and discovered another undiscovered species of lemur.
Since that first trip, Wright has devoted her life to protecting that rainforest and others in Madagascar.
Wright, despite being trained as a researcher, spent months travelling to raise money for what would become Ranomafana National Park in 1991. Part of the process involved enlisting residents of local villages to help protect the rainforest, which required economic development, increased access to healthcare, and a better education system.
Today, Ranomafana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, home to the Centre ValBio, a research station that Wright helped to found in 2003.
But despite her successes, Wright said she is still struggling to protect Madagascar’s few remaining rainforests. In 2009, a military coup threatened the Ranomafana park’s existence and even today, though the government of Madagascar is democratically elected, Wright said there is much more work to be done.
“This is a pivotal moment, this is the moment when we have a government, when we suddenly learn that we’re going to have funding again, when we will be able to make this last-ditch effort to help save those lemurs,” she said.
Sally Gee ’16, who attended the presentation, said Wright’s passion for her work was easy to see from her presentation.
“You see that she cares about her work,” Gee said at the reception afterwards.

Danyel T. Reiche, a visiting scholar at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, cited recognition by world political leaders and a desire for “soft power”—a form of political leverage in the international community—as some of the motives behind Qatar’s bid and subsequent status as host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.
Reiche, an associate professor of comparative politics at the American University in Beirut, spoke on Monday night as part of the Ash Center’s Democracy Seminar Series. Reiche’s particular area of interest is the intersection between sports and politics.
In a recent research paper, Reiche found that the main motives behind the Qatari government’s heavy investment in sports were to improve transnational relations, develop national identity and pride, and strengthen their national security and soft power, among other reasons.
“The sports investment is a way to build relations with the world,” Reiche said. “Without sports, fewer people would know about Qatar, and fewer people would care about Qatar.”
Amid Qatar’s recent move to host the 2022 tournament, Reiche acknowledged the conflict between traditional Qatari culture and the modernized world of international sports. He gave the example of the Qatari women’s national soccer team, which he said was created in 2011 in response to a demand from FIFA. According to Reiche, FIFA would not let Qatar host the tournament in 2022 if they did not have a women’s soccer team.
Reiche said that he talked to a coach for the Qatari women’s team about the initial reactions to the team’s formation. The coach told Reiche that of the 30 women invited to practice with the national team, only one got approval from her parents.
“I think that this was the most striking detail that Reiche offered,” said seminar attendee Pauline Yang, a graduate student at Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “This cultural collide will be an interesting trend to watch in the coming years.”
Another issue that was discussed at the end of the seminar was the sale and consumption of alcohol, a typical staple at major sporting events but forbidden in Islamic tradition. Reiche said that he predicted alcohol to be permitted at the 2022 World Cup, most likely in a concentrated area around the tournament site.
Muhammed Y. Idris, a research fellow at the Kennedy School and seminar attendee, said he saw the cultural conflict as one of the most import takeaways from the talk.
“When you have these rigid societies and there are these things that everyone wants to be a part of, the government is willing to bend the rules,” he said. “It will be interesting to see if there are any long-term implications of that.”

A class scheduling task force convened last year is considering proposals to change the duration and timing of classes offered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in light of the impending move of portions of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston in 2018.
The task force, composed of faculty members, staff, and students from FAS, is currently soliciting feedback on three proposals and may decide to bring the options to the full Faculty for discussion in the spring, according to several members of the task force.
In two of the proposals, the majority of FAS classes would meet in 90-minute blocks twice a week, over four days. Sections and classes such as studios and seminars that require longer meeting times would take place on a fifth day—which would be Wednesday in one proposal and Friday in the other proposal, according to Computer Science professor Greg Morrisett, who is a member of the task force.
The third proposal, which would make few scheduling changes, is “very similar” to the current FAS class schedule, Morrisett said.
The alternative schedules aim to address long-standing concerns about overlapping classes and course duration as well as account for the increased distance that students and faculty members will have to travel once the SEAS Allston campus opens.
According to Area Dean for Environmental Science and Engineering Steven C. Wofsy, the current schedule was designed for “stand-up chalk-and-talk classes” and does not sufficiently accommodate the increasing number of hands-on courses, which often demand longer class periods.
The current schedule also contains many overlapping courses, Morrisett said.
“Today, many courses teach on Monday and Wednesday for 90 minutes, and yet they’re really supposed to be teaching Monday-Wednesday-Friday for roughly an hour instead,” he said. “They end up conflicting with two Monday-Wednesday classes instead of just one.”
The two significantly altered schedules would also introduce a 15-minute passing period between classes, as opposed to the current seven-minute gap, to facilitate students’ commute between consecutive courses, Morrisett said.
The task force, co-chaired by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Deputy Provost Peggy Newell, is also considering shifting the schedule of classes that take place in Allston up by half an hour, according to Fawwaz Habbal, executive dean for education and research at SEAS and another member of the task force.
“The idea behind it is to have time for the students to be able to first move around between here and Allston,” said Habbal, adding that the task force estimated that the time it would take to transition between campuses would be between half an hour and 40 minutes.
Although the task forces were formed after the announcement that parts of SEAS would move to Allston, Morrisett said that the developing campus was not the only reason for the review of the class schedule.
“Even if Allston wasn’t happening, issues like the passing time to get from one class to another...should be fixed,” he said.
To reach its proposals, the task force reviewed “an enormous amount of data” on classroom usage and considered “a number of different options” based on the views of campus groups, including student groups and athletes, according to Morrisett.
However, he made clear that the process was not yet complete, and that the current set of alternative schedules could change with feedback.
“Those options still need to be discussed with the Faculty, and we need to get more feedback to decide whether they’re viable or not,” he said. ”And then, of course, that would need to be taken to the Faculty as a whole to vote on.”

The 2015 Paris United Nations Climate Change Conference may be the last chance for the international community to reach a meaningful agreement on action to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, former Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh said at a presentation at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government last Tuesday.
The Paris 2015 conference is the twenty-first annual meeting under the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, an international treaty aimed at stabilizing the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Ramesh explained that while some countries emit large amounts of greenhouse gas, some emit very little. He described two approaches that could be pursued in a potential agreement. The first would involve a scenario where the world’s largest emitters would shoulder the bulk of the responsibility whereas the second would encourage shared responsibility amongst a wider range of nations.
“The world is divided into many countries who like a top-down approach and a few countries who are influential, the big emitters, the ‘big boys’ so to speak, who prefer the bottom-up approach. This is one cause of the stalemate in the diplomacy,” Ramesh said.
Ramesh also mentioned the issue of differentiation, meaning every nation approaches negotiations from unique perspectives and with different historical perspectives.
“This is the crux of the differentiation issue,” Ramesh said. “How do you differentiate different countries at different levels of per capita income, how do you differentiate countries at different levels of emissions, and how do you get all countries as part of an agreement?”
The legal form of the agreement which may pass at the Paris Conference is yet to be determined, according to Ramesh. Negotiators are deciding whether the treaty will be legally binding with international consequences or simply enforced politically.
While Ramesh said he sees a difficult road to Paris 2015, he said that he is still hopeful for meaningful action because of the evolving position of key players such as China and the U.S.
Ramesh is a Fisher Family Fellow at the Kennedy School, where he leads study groups and lectures to promote international engagement.

UPDATED: October 7, 2014, at 2:40 a.m.
Forty instances of forced sexual contact on or near campus were reported to the Harvard University Police Department and other local law enforcement in 2013, five more than any other Ivy League school, according to the department's Annual Security Report released last week.
The report also showed a decline in reported incidents of robbery and an increase in the number of actions taken following liquor law violations.
The report is federally mandated by the Clery Act, passed in 1965, which requires that colleges publish annual crime and fire safety statistics. In addition to publishing three years of rates of reported campus crimes, HUPD included an overview of the police department, crime reporting information, and emergency notifications in the report, which was emailed from HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano to the Harvard student body last Wednesday.
HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley wrote that although the crime rate at Harvard is low, students should still be concerned about safety.
“It is important for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to remember that we are located in an urban setting and must contend with many of the crime and safety issues that exist in any city,” Riley said in the opening remarks of the report.
One subcategory of forced sex offenses, “forcible fondling,” rose from 14 to 22 reported offenses at Harvard between 2012 and 2013. In contrast, the number of reported rapes fell from 24 to 18 over the same time. All but five of the forcible sex incidents reported occurred on campus.
This year, the Clery Act added three new categories of reporting—domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking—as a result of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. The report cited nine instances of domestic violence, three instances of dating violence, and 16 instances of stalking.
Overall, 93 percent of reported crimes at Harvard were property-related. Robbery and aggravated assault at Harvard reached a three-year low, according to the report, with “aggravated assault” showing a steady drop from 36 incidents in 2011 to 14 in 2013. Thirty-two cases of burglary were reported.
The number of liquor law violations causing disciplinary action has risen over the last three years from 43 in 2011 to 48 in 2012 to 52 in 2013. This trend was mirrored across several Ivy League schools. The number of liquor law violation-related actions rose from 39 in 2012 to 67 in 2013 at Brown, 83 to 243 at Dartmouth, and 136 to 169 at Columbia.
Harvard reported the lowest number of disciplinary actions for drug infractions in the Ivy League, with seven in 2013.
In addition, the report showed five reports of “Bias Crimes” at Harvard in 2013. Three cases were religion-based, one case concerned race, and another ethnicity/national origin. All occurred on public land near campus.
None of the above numbers include Harvard’s Longwood Campus, which was tabulated separately.
Statistics include crimes reported directly to HUPD, local law enforcement agencies, and campus security authorities.
HUPD spokesman Steve Catalano declined to offer additional comment.

UPDATED: November 9, 2014, at 2:00 p.m.
The Harvard College Japan Initiative hosted a dinner with visiting professor of Japanese studies Christine R. Yano in Cabot House Living Room Monday. The group of roughly 20 students discussed Asian American identity and the racially charged death threat emailed to some Harvard affiliates last weekend, among other topics.
Although Asian American identity was the main topic of discussion at the HCJI dinner, the conversation often drifted to different topics, including Hello Kitty.
“I’m getting a lot of interview requests; I feel like I’m in a bifurcated existence,” said Yano, who teaches Anthropology 1606: “Being Asian American: Representation and Realities.”
“I’m talking about Hello Kitty and the very serious issue with the email. I’m afraid at some point I’m going to mix them up,” she added, to laughter.
When the group discussed the death threat emailed to many Asian Americans at Harvard over the weekend, some dinner attendees suggested that the Asian American community was quieter than it should have been following the threat.
“The typical minority reaction is to shut up,” Yano said. “African Americans have been pushed into speaking out, and they’re leading the way, but it’s not easy, it’s easier to shut up.”
Nga H. H. Nguy ’16, one of the event organizers, said the Asian community might not “respond as aggressively.”
“We have been overlooked for a long time—if something happens to Asians it’s just ‘meh,’” she said. “[It’s] racism by omission.”
To amplify the Asian American voice at Harvard, Yano said that she plans on creating a book of student stories about “being Asian at Harvard.”
“I’ve discovered such a hunger for talking about being Asian American,” she said. “If you care about this kind of community, let your voices be heard.”
The discussion took on a lighter tone with a prolonged, semi-philosophical conversation on Hello Kitty. Yano said she discovered that Hello Kitty is a little girl, not a cat as some believe, while organizing and exhibition.
“It’s like in art; does it matter what the artist thinks?” said Bran S. Shim ’15, another organizer. “They say it’s not a cat. It is.”
The event was the first of a series of dinners featuring professors from fields related to Japan.
“[It’s] less mochi and sushi parties and more about conversation, more substantial, digging into issues,” said Stéphane E. Fouché '15, another organizer.
HCJI works with the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies and holds summer school for students in Japan. According to Fouché, the organization aims to create a “bridge between Japan and universities abroad.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: November 7, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly misquoted Bran S. Shim ’15, talking about Hello Kitty. The quotation has been corrected.
CORRECTION: November 9, 2014
An earlier version of this article also incorrectly stated the context in which Yano learned that Hello Kitty is a girl, not a cat. In fact, she learned of the difference while organizing an exhibition.

Three days into an ongoing investigation into the source of a death threat that was emailed last Friday to hundreds of Harvard affiliates, law enforcement offered no updates on their progress even as more evidence continued to arrive in students’ inboxes Monday.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said Monday evening that the investigation remains ongoing and declined to comment further.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Harvard affiliates received yet another email Monday morning from one of the addresses under scrutiny for sending the racially charged death threat Friday afternoon. The email, received by students at 11:10 a.m. Monday, was sent from the same “hotmail.de” address that issued the original threat last Friday.
The body of the message was not signed, though the sender self-identified as a 15-year-old Vietnamese person living in France and appeared to apologize for the racially charged nature of the original threat, which disproportionately targeted women of Asian descent.
“[I]t is not really meant I apologize for the insult,” the sender wrote. The message echoes earlier ones in apparently asking The Crimson to delete its online story on the death threat. In broken English, the message references sending something through Dropbox and “my list as I have the email made​​.”
The “hotmail.de” email account is one of two at the center of the ongoing investigation. A second Google Mail account, which allegedly belongs to a person called Huy Dinh, sent several hundred affiliates an identical threat Friday afternoon.
That Google Mail account had targeted dozens of students before the threat was issued Friday, and for some recipients, the current investigation is only a continuation of months of unwanted contact from the person or people involved.
“I am mostly confused, honestly,” said Michelle Chan ’15, who said she has been receiving emails from the Google Mail account that allegedly belongs to Huy Dinh since August 2013. “I wish it would be over with.”
Other students said Monday that they were not necessarily worried by the growing number of emails, but instead doubted their authenticity. In community advisory messages issued over the weekend, Catalano told University affiliates that the original email likely originated from outside the country.
“It sounds like it was just a prank,” said Linda Wei ’16, who received the original threat Friday.
Still, students continued to rally around their peers in solidarity. The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, for example, drafted an open letter to the Harvard community, writing that “there is a space for this dialogue beyond the communities and individuals directly affected,” according to a copy of the draft.
“We are in solidarity, as communities of color, as collectives who believe in the power of a unified front that carries on internal and external dialogues,” the letter reads.
Administrators also plan to host a community discussion event at Holden Chapel at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to address the incident.

Last month, when Harvard announced that it would restructure the health benefit packages it offers to non-union employees in an effort to control costs, University officials sang one statistic in unison: the benefit plans, they said, had ballooned in expense to account for 12 percent of the University’s annual budget, up from 8 percent ten years ago.
“[H]ealth care costs continue to be a challenge for us. Harvard spends more than a half-billion dollars a year on benefits, which have grown over the last decade from 8% to about 12% of the University’s budget,” Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote in a letter to employees detailing the changes.
The statistic was meant, officials said, to illustrate an acknowledged reality in the benefits sphere: healthcare costs are rising fast, and so are institutions’ insurance liabilities.
Yet a closer look at annual financial reports reveals that the “8 percent to about 12 percent” claim used as a top justification for the changes—including the introduction of a deductible and coinsurance—misrepresents the actual changes in benefits costs.
The jump in costs that Hausammann described did take place, but over the course of only two years and more than a decade ago. Since that increase in the early 2000s, growth in benefits as a proportion of Harvard’s budgetary expenses has been relatively flat on average.
While benefit liabilities jumped from 8.93 percent of Harvard’s budget in Fiscal Year 2002 to 11.27 percent of the budget the next fiscal year, they remained largely steady in the ten-year period referenced by Hausammann. In the FY03-FY13 interval Hausammann cited, the percent-change of benefits as a share of the total budget was an increase of 5.8 percent, not 50 percent.
After Hausammann did not return multiple requests for comment throughout the day Monday, University spokesperson Jeff Neal contacted The Crimson late Monday night with a statement from Hausammann. In the statement, Hausammann referenced Harvard’s 2011 financial report, a section of which read: “benefits as a percentage of the University’s overall expenses... increase[d] from 8% in fiscal 2001 to 12% in fiscal 2011.” Hausammann said that that statistic informed the work of the benefits committee.
“As the basis for the UBC's deliberations, I used this fact in a communication about the benefit plan changes,” she said. “I should have been more precise about the exact timeframe that specific growth occurred and will be more clear in future communications.”
Hausammann added that the benefit “increases have occurred despite a number of important administrative changes, along with some modest plan design changes, that helped constrain cost growth rates and moderate premium increase growth for faculty and staff.”
Michael E. Chernew, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the chair of the University Benefits Committee, said Monday afternoon that the group relied on data provided by Hausammann and Harvard’s human resources department, which Hausammann leads. The benefits committee played an advisory role in the policy changes, according to Chernew.
“That is a question for Marilyn [Hausammann],” he said, when asked about how the benefits spending figures he cited were calculated. “The way that the benefits committee works is whatever data we have we get from essentially [the human resources department]. So that is not a number that I calculated, or a number that the benefits committee would verify.”
Bill Jaeger, the director of the Harvard Union of Clerical Technical Workers, criticized the University for using the statistic when presented with the discrepancy. HUCTW workers are not affected by the changes in benefits but have recently renewed conversation with administrators about their health plans.
“We were deeply disappointed and confused as to how the [number] came out of a committee that’s chock full of economists who should have known from looking at it that’s a problematic number,” Jaeger said.
Chernew added that the group was tasked with meeting a financial target set by the University, not with debating the merits of the target. He said he was not sure if a more accurate number would have changed the committee’s thinking.
“Would I rather the number not be a number that’s gotten so much attention, sure I would. But would it have changed what the committee did given the target we have given? No, I don’t think it would have,” he said, emphasizing that even with the disputed numbers, it is clear that health care costs are rising.
Brigitte Madrian, another member of the benefits committee and a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, also said that the specific numbers probably does not change the equation, adding she was not involved in gathering the statistics.
“I do think [the numbers] are a little bit of a red herring,” Madrian said. “Whether it’s 8 percent of total expenditure or 12 percent of total expenditure, it’s missing the point. We want to make sure that the spending is buying us the most in terms of healthcare for the faculty and staff at the University.”
The changes in non-union health plans center on the introduction of a $250 deductible at the point of care, except for routine office visits and tests. Before the changes, there was no deductible. Additionally, under the new plans, after thresholds of $250 per individual and up to $750 for a family, enrollees will shoulder 10 percent of costs. Before the changes, plans did not ask for an enrollee contribution. Co-payments for emergency room visits also rise under the new plan.
At the same time, Harvard also announced the creation of a new low-premium, high-deductible plan run through Health Savings Accounts. As required by the Affordable Care Act, the new plans fully cover preventative care.

Members of the United States men’s national soccer team practiced at Ohiri Field on Monday in the first of three days of training at Harvard’s facilities. The team will hold practices at 4:00 on both Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon before it heads to Hartford, Conn. for an exhibition match Friday against Ecuador.
Twelve players, including forward Jozy Altidore, midfielder Julian Greene, and defender Omar Gonzalez, participated in light drills for a little over an hour. Focusing on ball-handling and footwork, the players performed a keep-away drill and then played a five-on-five half-field game. Goalkeepers Brad Guzan and Nick Rimando went through a series of reflex drills on the other half of the field before joining the team for the five-on-five scrimmage.
The Harvard men’s and women’s varsity and club soccer teams were among the only spectators allowed into the complex to watch the closed practice.
Tonight, eight of the remaining players on the full 21-man squad, including defender John Brooks, midfielder Alejandro Bedoya, and defender DeAndre Yedlin will join the team at its Boston hotel.
Forward Landon Donovan will join the team on Thursday. This will be the former national team star’s first appearance for the team since being controversially left off the World Cup roster in May and it will mark his final appearance in a USMNT jersey. Donovan is first in U.S. history in goals (57), assists (58), and World Cup goals (five).
Among the team’s stars who will neither be participating in practices nor competing in the exhibition are forward Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is taking a year-long absence from the team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 7, 2014, at 4:15 a.m.
This past Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team (6-2-2, 1-0-1 Ivy) fought for 110 minutes against Yale (5-3-1, 0-1-1 Ivy) at Soldiers Field, finishing with a scoreless draw. This marked the Crimson’s fifth consecutive shutout, bringing its shutout-percentage to .700 on the season. Center backs junior Alika Keene and sophomore Bailey Gary were instrumental in fending off the Bulldogs’ attacks and fueling the shutout streak.
Saturday afternoon’s bout versus Yale was one of the Harvard’s most evenly matched contests this season, with each side producing 14 shots. The Bulldogs and the Crimson had three and four shots on goal, respectively. Coming into the match, the Crimson had a nine-game Ivy League winning streak, carrying over from last season. Four of those nine wins had a one-goal margin.  A major contributor to Harvard’s success has been the defensive team of Keene and Gary, with both players starting all nine of those Ivy games together.
Harvard head coach Ray Leone is excited by what Keene and Gary have demonstrated so far in the season, especially in terms of their ability to work with each other to stifle offenses and protect the net.
“They have really been as strong as you could possibly ask for together,” Leone said. “They cover each other really well, they complement each other really well. It’s been an awesome stretch for them.”
The center back positions in soccer are normally filled by two of the team’s toughest and most aggressive players. Leone was quick to highlight the stark difference between his two center backs’ demeanors on and off the field.
“Its kind of funny that they are such tough players and tough defenders when you watch them play. They are very soft spoken people in the locker room,” Leone said. “They are just really nice kids but they just play with an incredible edge in every game they play.”
Leone also noted the drastic growth that he has seen in Keene and Gary, especially Keene’s year-over-year rapid development.
“Alika is a year older so she has grown an amazing amount and that started in the last year when she became a presence, a 90-minute player,” Leone said. “She has picked up where she left off last year.”
Teammates have also highlighted the duo’s abilities and their roles as the anchors of the last line of defense for the Crimson squad. Co-captain Marie Margolius said that she is impressed by their exponential growth as defenders and the tremendous consistency they have displayed throughout this season.
“Having the two of them back there together is just so comforting because they are so solid and will do whatever they can to help the team at all times,” Margolius said. “An important part of the center back position is being able to work really well with whomever you are playing next to and the two of them have worked on really becoming a cohesive unit this season.”
Keene & Gary’s unique, symbiotic relationship is also exemplified by the comments they made about each other.
“We just have that chemistry that we didn't even need to work on,” Keene said about her teammate Gary. “She is a great player because she gives it all to the team and she is committed 110 percent.”
Gary shared similar sentiments about Keene, emphasizing Keene’s role as a team player.
“She works so hard and puts the team first,” Gary said. “You can always count on her and she is just an all-around great person to have on the team.”
With upcoming contests against Brown, Dartmouth, and Columbia, each of which were decided by one-goal margins last season, the Crimson will continue to rely on the Keene-Gary duo to maintain the defense it has showed in the team’s first ten games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven years ago, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker had a vision. He wanted to transform Lavietes Pavilion from just another hardwood hall in the Ivy League into the home of one the elite basketball programs in the nation. Now, his vision is becoming a reality. The Crimson has built a dynasty. Amaker’s team has won at least a share of the conference regular season title in each of the past four seasons, made three straight tournament appearances, and beaten a plethora of top ranked opponents, including Florida State, New Mexico, and Cincinnati. Now, Harvard is posed to be ranked in the top-25 in the nation this season (ESPN’s Dick Vitale has the Crimson at 20th) and is the overwhelming favorite to repeat as Eight Ancient champions. So what’s the key to Amaker’s success? Recruiting. After bringing to Harvard top-100 recruit Zena Edowsman last year and four-star recruit Chris Egi this season, Amaker has now added two more big names to his future rosters. Last week, Weisner Perez and Tommy McCarthy both committed to the admissions process at Harvard. Perez, who hails from Morton, Illinois and stands at 6’ 6’’, will give Harvard a big height advantage at the small forward position in the Ivy League. Perez, who received interest from top programs such as Xavier, Creighton, and DePaul, has been receiving Division I scholarship offers since his sophomore year. “After that in junior year it really started to heat up,” said Perez. “There was times I got four a day. Most were Ivies.”Perez, who is incredibly academically focused, believed in exactly what Amaker was selling: a top academic institution with a high mid-major basketball program.“Eventually the ball stops bouncing,” said Perez. “The Ivy League was the best situation for me where I could play basketball and have a great education. Harvard speaks for itself.”As for Perez’s future with the Crimson, Mike Irvin, Perez’s AAU coach, calls him a “a mismatch nightmare…who is big enough to bang with the big guys but fast enough to get past the smaller guards.”During the recruiting process, Amaker—who is prohibited by NCAA rules from discussing the commitments until May 1— pitched Perez on a future role similar to the versatile senior forward Jonah Travis. Nonetheless, Perez has been working to develop a jump shot off the dribble to make him a more inside-out player. Perez rebounds at an incredibly high rate, and had the state’s only 20-20 game last season. As a result, Amaker should be able to find a spot for Perez early on next season, with Harvard’s top three rebounders from last season all current seniors.
Like his future teammate, McCarthy also found Amaker’s pitch of attending a preeminent institution and playing for a potentially nationally ranked team irresistible.
Much like junior captain Siyani Chambers, McCarthy plays point guard, stands at just 6’ 0’’, and is a natural-born leader.“Me and Siyani are both good leaders,” said McCarthy. “He is a great floor general and passer. Coach Amaker liked me a lot because of my ability to lead and shoot.”
With schools such as BYU, San Diego, and Rice all interested, McCarthy decided that he couldn’t turn down the opportunity to play for the former Duke point guard Amaker.“I started getting recruited by Harvard my sophomore year,” said McCarthy. “I’ve been hearing from Harvard for a while, but didn’t hear from Coach Amaker until the beginning of this summer.”
One of the reasons Amaker’s interest peaked this summer was McCarthy’s ability to shoot the rock. He can spot up, shoot of the dribble, and pull-up from range reminiscent of Laurent Rivard ’14, Harvard’s top all-time three point shooter. But what stands out more than McCarthy’s jump shot is his guts. With 1.3 seconds left in one of California’s biggest rivalry game, McCarthy calmly knocked down a game-winning three point shot to beat No. 4-ranked Torrey Pines in front of a standing-room-only crowd against his former school. Though McCarthy won’t be able to have an impact on the court for Harvard this year, he has already begun making an impact, reaching out to Northfield Mount Hermon senior and four-star recruit Aaron Falzon during Falzon’s official visit to recruit him to join McCarthy at Harvard.—Staff writer Andrew Farber can reached at andrewfarber@college.harvard.edu.

Good morning Harvard, and happy Tuesday! Today’s October 7th, marking the end of our first full week of October, and the anniversary of a number of events in history. If you’re looking for a conversation topic at dinner with your distant link-mates or an icebreaker to create a bond with that cute kid from section, we’ve got you covered. Here’s October 7th in history:
1691: William and Mary, joint monarchs of England, issue a royal charter for the Province of Massachusetts Bay, which we now know as the states of Maine and Massachusetts. Happy birthday to the state Harvard (and seemingly 50% of the student body) calls home!
1868: Cornell University holds opening day ceremonies, welcoming an initial class of 412 students, the highest at any American University at the time. Cornell’s freshman class this year has 3,261 students.
1916: Georgia Tech beats Cumberland University 222-0 in the most ridiculous college football game of all time. Until Harvard-Yale this year, that is...Go Crimson!
1955: Allen Ginsberg, American poet, performs his poem Howl for the first time.
2001: The U.S. invasion of Afghanistan begins with an air assault and covert operations on the ground. Thirteen years ago today. The Class of 2018 was in kindergarten.
And that’s just the start. What’s today going to be? Make it a great day or not, the choice is yours, Harvard!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today’s temperature will be considerably warmer than it’s been for a while, with a high of 74 degrees and a low of 62. Unfortunately, it’s not as good as it seems, it’ll be cloudy all day with a 20% chance of rain. Sigh. Can’t have everything, right?

Recently we reported that a certain that blondie brownies were one of the most unhealthy items in the dhalls.
Can you hear the sound of hearts breaking?
We cried. We ate Ranger cookies then we cried again. It was just unfair. How could brownies be more unhealthy than blue cheese burgers with bacon or just eating a stick of butter?
However, the powers that be saw this grave injustice and changed it to how it should be.
Go celebrate guys! Eat the whole tray if you want to!

In Lamont at 4:45 A.M. with a 10 page paper due in a few hours, the Buzzfeed lists of the “25 Hunkiest Egyptian Protestors” or “15 Hedgehogs With Things That Look Like Hedgehogs” become super relevant. The Internet provides some seriously wonderful sources of procrastination, but so many of us fall into the infinite depths of Reddit and internet quizzes to find out which type breakfast cereal we are (I’m “Frosted Flakes”). Here are some awesome blogs so you can feel marginally less guilty about prioritizing web browsing over your sleep, sanity, and GPA.
Hyperbole and a Half
This is the type of blog that you should refrain from reading if you are into “squatting and surfing” or on the silent floor of Widener, because you will awkwardly laugh out loud and get some looks. This combination of a web comic and blog outlines unfortunate situations from a dog that just won’t understand to darkly comic episodes of depression. Author Allie Brosh claims she began her career because her mother tricked her into writing a story in order to distract from her immediate goal of wrapping the cat in duct-tape. Enough said.
World War II Today
Beginning on March 15, 2008, World War II Today presents what happened each day 70 years ago. Focused on individual incidents, history unfolds in a new and addicting way. Pro-tip: find out if there was a Blitz on your birthday in 1941!
Beer Labels in Motion
This is pretty self-explanatory. If you are interested in discovering new brands of beer or watching an animation of the farmer on the label or “Hop Rising” using a pitchfork, this is the blog for you.
9to5Mac
Warning: this is a real blog with information that could actually be useful. Founder Mark Gurman started working at Apple as a high-schooler, is now a Senior Editor, and reports extensively on Apple products and initiatives. With everything from leaking the first photos of iPhones to popular tech toys, if cutting edge reviews and news is what you seek, look no further.
The Bloggess
One of the most acclaimed blogs on the internet, “The Bloggess” is a surefire avenue to spending hours enticed by strikingly honest and hilarious tales such as “Beyoncé the five-foot-tall metal chicken.” Raised by a taxidermist father with a real squirrel sock puppet, gothic in high school, and plagued by overly aggressive PR reps, Jenny Lawson was destined to be  an internet gem. Look out for the prominently featured link to a picture of Wil Wheaton collating papers!
I am a Food Blog
After living off coffee and Cheez-its from the vending machine for longer than you’d like to admit, the internet can provide nothing better than a nice food blog. More than just recipes or pretty pictures, iamafoodblog.com provides commentary, gifs, interesting and fun new recipes, along with, well, really pretty pictures.
Thug Kitchen
If iamafoodblog.com is just not hood enough for you, fear not! Thug Kitchen will also provide you with countless great, in your face, recipes, along with scintillating and relevant commentary. For example, Thug Kitchen solves a fall conundrum with a Sweet Potato loaf this week and reminds readers to, “forget buying some nasty ass scented candles to make it smell like Fall. Bake a batch of this badass bread and your place will smell dope as hell. Plus, you know, you get food and that’s always better than a fucking candle.
