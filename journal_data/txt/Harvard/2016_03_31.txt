After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thanks, Carol. Your dramatic departure from Alexandria ushered in an hour in which characters neglect all responsibility and any sense of reason. Virtually emptying the town of all of its key characters, three search parties leave on separate paths and at separate times, giving no thought to overall strategy or coordination. It is a wonder that these people are still alive. Also, negative points to Carol’s new boyfriend for being noticeably absent from these search parties. All the cool kids have left Alexandria, vaulting viewers into moments of internal tension, moralization, and sweet, sweet danger in a narratively muddled penultimate episode.
Carol somehow finds success in a one-versus-five Mexican standoff against the annoyingly omnipresent Saviors this episode. Her anxious, God-fearing act yields to a callous massacre in which she nonchalantly impales a man with a stick. The episode further stresses the consequences of brutally and preemptively striking Negan’s compound, which has been continually met with a seemingly infinite supply of goons closing in on Alexandria to balance the scales of post-apocalyptic justice. It appears that they know where Alexandria is and have somehow taken weapons from Hilltop to launch a massive invasion upon our unwitting heroes. The search parties’ persistent confrontations with these Saviors embody an inescapable karmic payback in which our survivors’ one lapse into cruelty has finally come back to haunt them.
Johnny Cash’s “It’s All Over” playfully ignites the episode’s downward spiral into unnecessary danger. This cycle of action and consequence manifests itself in Daryl’s agonizing regret over sparing Dwight’s life, thereby compelling him to finish what he started. Daryl blames himself for Denise’s death, as evidenced by a shot of him holding her “Dennis” keychain, and is blatantly out for revenge. He believes that he is getting vengeance for her sake, but Glenn pointedly highlights that with people depending on him back home, it is in reality a selfish attempt to alleviate his own anxiety. Unfortunately, this escapade leads him, Rosita, Glenn, and Michonne into an even angrier Dwight’s hands, culminating in a cliffhanger in which Daryl—perhaps not so invincible after all—is shot. Daryl, of course, is not actually dead: the cut-to-black does not explicitly show his death and Dwight’s remark at the end reveals his intention to merely injure and not kill our beloved Daryl.
Morgan, the show’s resident humanist and moral center, yet again lectures Rick on the value of human life. It is a formula the show frequently employs—one that can be dubbed the “fight-and-lesson” sequence—but this time it works. After eliminating a group of zombies in one of the show’s laughable near-death fakeouts, Rick takes aim at a presumably escaping Savior but is interrupted by Morgan. Rick believes that his ruthlessness is justified by the peace and stability it is intended to preserve. He does not, he says, “take chances anymore.” Morgan lectures Rick on the values of patience, forgiveness, and redemption, repeating his mantra that “all life is precious” and that every action “gets a return.” While Morgan is a fascinating and necessary character in essence, his giving the very same lectures to our obtuse cast of characters is increasingly one-note. His points are clear and poignant, however, because he used to be one of the many psychopaths Rick is so intent on gunning down. Morgan’s own spiritual revival has shown him the possibility that “people can come back,” a message that he finally gets across to Rick. The key observation here is that Crazy Rick is no better than the psychopaths he is so keen on killing. He is as broken as Morgan was, and Morgan knows a way out.
“East” never bores, and it finally brings the survivors into Negan’s grasp. The disparate plotlines are entertainingly tense but self-indulgent, and the episode’s lack of internal consistency is inexcusable even by the show’s own standards. These sequences, as fun as they are, are born of our seemingly shrewd survivors’ lack of any sense of caution or sensibility. That they also happen to be constantly outwitted by Dwight and his crew of redneck ninja Saviors vanishing in and out of thin air reeks of peculiar screenwriting. Stepping back to take a cold, hard look at the overall plotting reveals that really, none of this should have happened at all. The show was entitled to the benefit of the doubt when Carol left Alexandria at the end of the last episode—there might have been some further explanation for her actions. But it has now become clear there was no legitimate reason beyond stirring the storytelling pot.

Harvard alumna Gillian Murray Kendall is the author of the post-apocalyptic novel “The Garden of Darkness” and the upcoming fantasy novel “The Book of Forbidden Wisdom,” as well as a professor at Smith College specializing in Shakespeare, non-Shakespearean Renaissance Drama, and 17th Century poetry. Her written work delicately explores themes of familial relationships, romantic partners, and the intersection between the two. The Crimson had the opportunity to speak with her about her writing process, the influences behind her work, and the game of Buttony.
The Harvard Crimson:  It seems like you had a fascinating early life. Do you see any parts of the experiences you’ve had influencing and guiding your narratives?
Gillian Murray Kendall: It’s true—I’ve gone through a lot of phases in my life. I spent a lot of time in Africa in the ’80s, then I competed in horse shows in the ’90s, and some of those experiences find themselves in my work. I can’t say that any character stands for people I know, but I just believe that everything that’s happened to you, you bring to the page. You can’t really avoid it because the whole world is filtered through your experience; so while I can’t think of anything specific except for horses—I think I got everything right about that in the book—I just believe that the whole thing is an experience filtered through time and it comes out on the page in weird ways sometimes.
THC:  Tell me a bit about the intersection between your work in academia and your fiction writing.
GMK:  Well, [academia] influences my work: Quotations pop up from time to time from Shakespeare, so there’s always that. I sometimes think that I don’t have much of Shakespeare in me—no one does. But honest to God, we both have problems with plot. Shakespeare stole all his plots but two, and I struggle with my plot. But more than that, when I teach Shakespeare, I can talk a lot about what kind of things Shakespeare must have read, and to me, writing comes from reading—that’s the place, the spot of inspiration. It comes out of everything that you’ve ever read—and of course there’s invention—but unless you’re part of that grand storytelling tradition, which goes back further than Shakespeare, you’re off to one side. You need to join that tradition; it’s a good thing to be part of. I tell my students that when I teach creative writing.
THC:  What do you have them read?
GMK:  A number of things. Hawthorne and Poe, but I also have them read the New Yorker fiction that comes out every week so it’s new for all of us, and I’ll come in and hope that I have something interesting to say. And usually the New Yorker doesn’t disappoint; the last story was called “Buttony,” and it was a great one to teach…. We had a lot of fun taking it apart, but sometimes the stories are very obscure and hard to get into. But it’s fun that we’re all together in doing it. And it’s a good feeling, and they were surprised at first when I said, “I’m reading this at the same time you are.”
THC: What’s your process for coming up with your narratives?
GMK: This relates to what I tell my students to work on too; even their essays need to have a story, a narrative that they’re telling me. I start writing, and I don’t always start at the beginning because I think that’s the hardest part. If you’re writing an essay, you know how the introductory paragraph is always a total pain. Sometimes I’ll start with a theme, or with dialogue, or with description, and I’ll hope that it goes somewhere. And usually it does because character can drive a plot.
THC:  Who’s your favorite character?

Lahore. Brussels. Ankara. Grand-Bassam. Chattanooga. Istanbul. Paris. San Bernardino. The Russian jet over Sinai. Tunisia. The Boston Marathon. Westgate. Oslo. London. Beslan. The Marriott Hotel in Jakarta. Moscow. Bali. New York City.
You probably skimmed these names; you certainly didn’t recognize all of them. I don’t blame you—there are so many. And this is a mere handful of the terrorist attacks that have killed thousands and wounded tens of thousands more since the turn of the millennium.
Before the dust had settled in Brussels, an explosion ripped through a park in Pakistan. In the two weeks before, bombings in Turkey. A couple months earlier it was Nigeria, a few more and it was California. Comparisons to cancer are accurate: Terrorism is a malignancy that has metastasized around the globe.
Yet terrorism is a pinprick, especially in the United States. Consider the accurate and oft-cited statistics about how you are more likely to be killed by slipping in the shower or being shot by a police officer.
In the wake of each attack, politicians are internationally united by the pledge that they will keep us safe. Our Presidential candidates, from Bernie Sanders to Ted Cruz, disagree on everything except that they will do more than anyone else to protect us from danger.
What happened to the home of the brave? Have we become a nanny state? With the exception of President Obama—who is criticized for being too aloof in the face of a nation’s fear—our leaders sound like babysitters crooning a lullaby: I will guard you from harm.
Terrorism wins every time we take off our shoes at the airport. Every time we think “shooting!” when a car backfires. Every time we trade liberty for security. Terrorism has crept into our psyche and our national discourse, and each time a candidate tells us they will protect us, terror imbeds itself deeper in our homeland and our hearts.
Are you not more terrified by the thousands of teenagers who every year commit suicide? By the 795 million people with not enough to eat, many of them children, many of them in American cities and towns? Keeping Americans safe should be about healthcare, jobs, guns, and housing. I am more scared of pedestrian crossings than terrorist attacks, and you should be too.
We should eschew days of news coverage in the wake of attacks and the politicians who try to look strong by pledging to protect us. I am not saying that terrorism is not a problem, and reassuring statistics about the scarcity of attacks do not invalidate the fear of being blown away at a cafe around the corner from your home, or while waiting for a train on your way to work. Still, why do we succumb to that fear when the grille of a drunk driver’s car is just as arbitrary and horrible a death, and much more common?
Terrorism is a problem, yes. But it’s more of an issue on the scale of wet stairs and falling vending machines. We should treat it accordingly. The dangers of fear are much greater: the loss of privacy, independence, and liberty.
9/11 destroyed more than lives. It tore apart families and left scars that 15 years later are still healing. For many young adults, 9/11 is a first memory. It kicked off an age of terror in which we are still engulfed. And, of course, it dragged the United States into intransigent Middle Eastern conflicts that go back centuries and will not end with Western intervention.
There were no good solutions to the pain and anger that followed the fall of the towers, but perhaps the England of 1975 should serve as a guide. That year, the Irish Republican Army was relentlessly bombing London. From my mother’s apartment, she often heard the blasts. Instead of bunkering down with each attack, the city lived on. The Underground didn’t close. The shattered businesses mopped up the blood, swept up the glass, put plywood over the windows, and reopened the next day. That was how they chose to honor the dead. And Londoners never stopped going out, never stopped showing up and living the lives of their own choosing.
That is how you defeat terrorism. Not by x-raying belts and confiscating tubes of toothpaste.
Of course, efforts to eliminate terrorist groups like Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the Taliban must go on, as costly and counter-productive as they can be. We owe it to those not lucky enough to live in a country where furniture is more dangerous than militants. And domestic security is undoubtedly important. But we should not crave comfort and obsess over the attacks that are not stopped, because they will never all be stopped. We should accept this risk as the price we pay for living in the land of the free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 31, 2016, 4:34 p.m.
The transition from high school to college is a well-known challenge, often more difficult for students from low-income backgrounds. The costs of moving into a dorm room and purchasing essentials can quickly amount to a significant financial burden.
A recent financial aid initiative will seek to allay these costs, offering a $2,000 “start-up” grant to every Class of 2020 student whose family earns less than $65,000 per year. The $1,000 received at the start of each semester freshman year is meant to help covers the many costs that come alongside tuition, room, and board. We are excited by this change and see it as an innovative way to make students from low-income families feel more comfortable as they adjust to campus.
The stipend is intended to help cover the costs of essentials such as bedding, toiletries, stationery, and notebooks. It will also help many students transition into college socially by giving them spending money to use alongside their peers.
This financial aid initiative is only the tip of the iceberg. The obstacles facing low-income students are not purely financial. Some of the other challenges of acclimating to college life at large include interacting with professors, attending office hours, and keeping up academically. Students from strong high schools are typically much better prepared for this sort of a learning environment. We believe that each and every student admitted to Harvard should be given the resources to succeed upon arriving here. That’s why efforts like the implementation of designated first-generation tutors as Mather House piloted this year are so important.
We remain firm in our belief that bridge programs would also help students navigate the transition from high school to college with greater ease. For example, the Freshman Enrichment Program, which was chosen as the recipient of the Undergraduate Council’s “Harvard Project” grant last April, is targeted at helping low-income and first-generation students transition to life at the College. Such student-run programs are critical and should be expanded to mirror offerings at other universities which often take place before classes start in the fall.
As Harvard searches for ways to support students on financial aid, it must also listen to concerns about the academic resources that it already provides. Last spring, a Crimson news piece highlighted the struggles low-income students face in purchasing textbooks. In some cases, the cost of course materials spurred students to take different classes with less expensive materials. The College should include the cost of course materials in tuition so that students do not face these sort of tradeoffs. Such academic essentials are costs that ought to be covered by the College when students are unable to do so themselves.
We see the new “start up” grant as just that: a start. We hope the administration will use this foundation to continue building an inclusive atmosphere for low-income students.
This editorial has been changed to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 31
This editorial has been updated to clarify the distinction between the Freshman Enrichment Program and the First-Year Enrichment Program. The Freshman Enrichment Program is a student-run initiative that won UC funding last year, but the First-Year Enrichment Program has been run by the Freshman Dean's Office and the Advising Programs Office for the last four years.

“You know who doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Recruited athletes. I mean, it’s great that they can run high, jump far, and dribble a ball pretty well. But I don’t understand what those traits have to do with being a future leader in the world. It’s also not like Harvard is recruiting the best athletes in the country or making a lot of money from athletics. I don’t understand why they get to skate by in admissions with their poor grades.”
“I guess. But if you say that, do you know who also doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Kids who get in because of their crazy music skills. They’re just like athletes: They have a talent that makes them entertaining, but does that really set them apart as a person who could make a real difference in the world? Just go to Juilliard. Otherwise, you’re gaming the system.”
“Ok, fine. But at least athletes and musicians have a talent. You know who really doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Those good-for-nothing legacy kids. Some may have talents. But others seem as dumb and untalented as the fifth-place contender of an Elvis impersonation contest.  Legacy kids get money, educated parents, and a free ticket here. It’s crazy.”
“But there are other kids who get advantages from birth. You know who really doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who”
“Black students. Not all of them. But the ones from wealthy homes or first-generation African immigrant families. Affirmative action is supposed to promote the nth generation descendants of slaves who lived in poverty. Not the kid in Brookline pulling up to his private school parking lot in a brand new SUV with little TV screens in the back seats playing gangster rap. Harvard is crowded with kids from these kinds of backgrounds who get this application boost for no reason.”
“The tricky part about race is ethnicity. You know who really doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Jews. I mean, explain me this: Asians have a lot of good applicants to Harvard, but they are hurt by affirmative action. But Jews are even more incredibly overrepresented on this campus—like, every other white guy I meet is on the phone with his worrying grandmother five times a day—and whites don’t get hurt by affirmative action. Why don’t they get the same treatment as Asians?”
“Yeah, but Jewish families are wealthier. Maybe that’s why? I mean, you know who really doesn’t deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Wealthy kids. If you’re rich and have half a brain in investing your educational resources, you can basically buy a good SAT score, a good college essay, a good list of internship experiences. Harvard does well in its racial diversity. But only something like 15 percent of Harvard undergraduates come from the bottom 40 percent of U.S. incomes. Harvard is ‘need blind’ in the worst possible way. It’s blind to the needs of smart kids from poor backgrounds. And it’s blind to the advantages of the kids whose greatest life challenge has been fitting into the small back seat of their dad’s sports car.”
“Sure, kids from wealthy families get some advantages. But at least they prove they’re smarter than other applicants from wealthy families. The problem is kids who never have to prove their smarts. So you know who really doesn’t’ deserve to be here?”
“Who?”
“Recruited athletes—”
Shut up. Shut up! SHUT UP! This is getting so petty. The Class of 2020 gets its decision emails today. Is this is how we welcome them? I know, I know. A Harvard degree carries with it a lot of power, so this is an important conversation. But does it have to be so constant and gut-wrenching and non-empirical and anecdotal and personal? Every other article in The Crimson is about this kind of topic. And most of them make claims far beyond what their data can prove—at the cost of threatening peoples’ identity on campus. How do people feel so comfortable talking about the deservingness of others? I can think of 1,000 ways to discount my own identity and admission here. For me, it’s a lot harder to say these things about the peers I’ve come to admire. But people do it, and there’s a price: We feel guilt instead of gratitude, stress instead of satisfaction, and defensive instead of innovative on this campus. It’s so easy to feel that this place is a school of ruthless competition and ire, rather than a home. We need to change that.
“C’mon, Dash! Stop taking things so personally. If you can’t handle this level of critical thought without spinning it into a victimization narrative, then you don’t deserve to be here.”
Great…

As I step onto the T on the morning of March 26, I notice the car is a little crowded. The normal Boston commuters and weekend brunch-goers are replaced with a very different kind of traveler. Armed with scepters, wigs, props, and carefully crafted homemade costumes, these T riders are all headed to the same place: Anime Boston.
Bringing a new kind of cultural flair to an otherwise average March weekend, Anime Boston is a three-day convention located at the Hynes Convention Center and Sheraton Boston. The largest anime convention in the Northeast, it boasts an annual turnout of more than 22,000 people, with estimates ranging up to 25,000. The convention itself includes shops, art galleries, contests, panels, and more.
Many convention-goers choose to dress up as characters from various TV shows, movies, comic series, and other media. Called “cosplaying,” this practice results in thousands of real-life cartoon characters roaming the streets of Boston, and makes the convention and its surrounding areas colorful, eclectic, and exciting for participants and spectators alike.
In one of the multiple block-long lines that lead into the convention center, I meet Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl from “Yuh-Gi-Oh.” Punk versions of Princess Bubblegum and Marceline from Adventure Time stand a few spots back in line. Rushing out of the Shake Shack on Newbury Street, I run into Alexander Hamilton and Eliza Schuyler from the musical “Hamilton.” The more I explore this phenomenon, the more I begin to realize that the convention-goers are extraordinary—at least, when it comes to their skills with a glue gun.
“What I like most about it is just how enthusiastic the community is,” says Cassie E. Lowell '17, who attended the convention dressed as both Pearl from the TV show “Steven Universe” and popular Internet character Rose Lalonde. She highlights the seemingly tedious nature of cosplay—it involves spending tons of time and effort on outfits that will only be worn for a few hours. Yet the people's enthusiasm more than makes up for it. “Everyone else is really excited to see you dress up, and they ask to take pictures of you,” Lowell says.
The frenzy to take photos with characters is certainly widespread. In the middle of my conversation with Dark Magician Girl (alias Hannah Cousins of Newburyport, Mass.), a man approaches our group with the level of enthusiasm usually reserved for celebrities, exclaiming: “Dark Magician, Dark Magician Girl, can I take a photo?”
“It’s hard for us to get more than ten feet without taking a picture,” Dark Magician tells me afterward. When I ask them apologetically for a photo of my own, though, the group doesn’t seem upset. On the contrary, they light up and quickly assume their characters’ signature poses, brandishing wands and props and appearing startlingly like anime characters themselves.
Although most people can’t quite articulate how they became involved with anime or convention-going, they all agree how quickly these things become life-long passions. Lowell says she first attended a convention in Baltimore, Md. during middle school. Eight years later, she has created and worn more than 30 costumes to events like Anime Boston. “You go to your first ‘con,’ and then you never stop going to them,” Sharanya Pulapura '19, another convention-goer from Harvard, says.
The convention’s website cites its goal as "celebrat[ing] and promot[ing] Japanese animation, comics, and pop-culture.” Yet Anime Boston actually promotes much more than one specific culture. Costumes from all types of genres are represented (I spot both an Aladdin and a Rapunzel), but one uniting theme is acceptance.
“I like being able to be myself more often than I usually am in my day-to-day,” punk Princess Bubblegum, alias Miranda Cummings of Providence, R.I., says. People seem focused entirely on the creativity and enthusiasm of fellow convention-goers, leaving behind any prejudices or biases and instead accepting everyone as a member.
According to convention-goers, the anime community has been a safe haven for members of the BGLTQ community, as well as various other minority groups. “A large portion of people got into the anime community because they didn’t feel accepted,” says Davis M. Lazowski '19. “They know they want to make sure everyone feels accepted to carry the community forward.”
Themed panels, some of the convention’s main attractions, consistently examine issues of gender and sexuality. Panels discussing gender identity at conventions join various others on everything from classical mythology in anime to engineering electronic costumes. With the enormous amount of people attending the convention, no issue is left undiscussed.
“All around, it’s just a really nice melting pot of individual expression,” Cummings notes. “And just having a fun time.”

Class is not in session, but Lowell Lecture Hall is packed.
In the building’s basement, a tangle of more than 100 dancers warms up before Expressions Dance Company’s first show of the day. Expressions, a student-led hip hop troupe at Harvard, debuts their spring show, "Excuse Me?," in 45 minutes.
A quick walk through the basement reveals a tornado of activity. Dancers are pouring out of the small hallway's three classrooms and two bathrooms. While every space has a different purpose, each one is filled with an explosion of energy.
In the first classroom, framed by the desks pushed hurriedly against the wall, people rehearse in groups of two or three—talking excitedly, laughing, and plugging into music to get prepped for the performance. One dancer starts singing “Too Much Booty in the Pants” to herself. The second room holds about a dozen people engaging in a more unified practice of an upcoming routine. The third room, where Expressions members gab around tables, is distinctly more relaxed. In the hallway, some students practice their moves side by side, while others squeeze behind their backs on their way to the classrooms. Hours of dance training have prepared them to glide effortlessly through the crowd.
“I think there’s something about show day that creates bonds that other experiences just can’t,” says Expressions director Rebecca H. Neuman ’16.
Five minutes until showtime, the Expressions directors call all dancers to assemble in the hallway for The Pulse, the pre-show ritual during which the team passes a squeeze from hand to hand. Neuman explains, “There’s a lot of excitement, and it’s great to take a second to be quiet and reflect on the performance [and] get ready mentally. And it creates a really strong sense of community.”
The Expressions dancers invite me to participate in The Pulse. We hold hands in a big circle, forming a stretched-out loop in the small hallway. We close our eyes, and the hallway falls unusually silent. For just a moment, a feeling of peace blankets the hubbub in the basement. The dancers are connected, united in their excitement and bonded by their art form. I wait intently for The Pulse to reach me. I hold onto it for a second before sending it on its way.
After 96 seconds of tranquility, the girl who initiated the first squeeze cheers loudly. The rest of the group joins in. The cheer marks the end of The Pulse, when the hand-squeeze makes a complete circle.

The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts wears many hats, all of which are unimpeachably chic. If you are an architecture buff, you appreciate that it is the only building in North America designed by the world-renowned Swiss modernist Le Corbusier. For those of you who study Visual & Environmental Studies, the Center is your academic home, whether you shoot stills, absorb cinematic thrills, bathe printing plates in the fourth floor acid vats, or dab oil paints on the third. If none of these apply, you have likely had little reason to visit the Carpenter Center lately. But it might be time to don an all-black outfit, pack a recycled canvas tote, and head over to the newest addition to the 54-year-old Center: a pop-up art bookstore.
For many years, the Carpenter Center and the VES Department were one and the same: Students reigned over the building with abandon and professors mounted exhibitions when they could. There is still a haphazardness to the place, marked by the ever-present smell of turpentine, the dust and shavings outside the wood shop, and the unexpected looming force of a pneumatic sculpture exhibition. Last fall, the lobby was bathed in pink light for one such installation. But these days, the building itself has a staff, tasked with caring for its historic legacy and overseeing programming to engage the Harvard community in Le Corbusier’s mission of fostering a space for creative freedom.
When I meet with Daisy Nam, the Center’s Assistant Director, she points us to the lobby couches, an L-shaped strip of concrete upholstered in dark brown leather. “It took us, like, six months to choose this color, so we’re so excited when anyone sits here,” she explains. Whether her team is collaborating with the Harvard Art Museums on a gallery intervention or displaying the work of visiting faculty and thesis students, the group has been busily reimagining the space over the past two years, specifically looking to fill an awkward cluster of third-floor gallery rooms.
Lacking the climate control required by many art objects or the space to accommodate an extensive show, this area, formerly known as the Sert Gallery, has become the Consumer Research Center/, the punctuation suggesting a cornucopia of possible additions and combinations after the slash. Its logistical challenges are especially unfortunate on a campus already starved for exhibition space, student and otherwise. For now, it is occupied by an outpost of Motto Books, a Berlin-based fine art bookstore with other locations across Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Switzerland. At its opening a little over a month ago, the John R. and Barbara Robinson Family Director of the Capenter Center, Jim Voorhies, announced plans to rotate the space with other consumer pop-ups, maybe a farmer’s market or a craft beer tasting room to bring a little slice of Brooklyn to Harvard. The bookstore, though, is slated to occupy the space through December 2017—it’s a pop-up with a lot of sticking power.
Whether the consumers are doing the research or are being researched, or even who these consumers are, remain to be seen. “We want to sell books, but we’re not relying on that,” explains Nam. That’s good, because the prices are far beyond the range of a typical student’s budget. She’s more interested in the process of discovery that happens in unusual bookstores. Nam argues that the Internet’s commercially driven structure restricts our online consumption of media and content more than we think. As an antidote to this trend, she wants students to enter the bookstore, flip at random through an exhibition catalog or an artist zine with a name like Fotograf, and discover a different world.
Walking into the new Consumer Research Center/ itself feels like entering a different world—the pristine white gallery walls confer a sense of deep importance on the spare but carefully curated display of books. There is the periodicals section, though it is no doctor’s office spread: My familiarity ends at Cabinet, and then there are the European publications usually unavailable in America: Texte sur Kust, Mono Kultur, Pin-Up, and All-In. Some books hail from closer to home, including a series from Exact Change, a local publisher. There are artist books, exhibition catalogs (some adorned with names of Harvard faculty), illustrated poetry, and all manner of fonts and innovative design aesthetics. One book I pick up is mostly blank, with disjointed art criticism on only a few pages.
A square table dominates the center of the room as the store’s ethereal staff arranges books just so. Ostensibly, this is where all of the research is meant to be conducted, and Nam informs me that classes from Rhode Island School of Design, Tufts, Boston University, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and MIT have all recently taken field trips to the Center. Looking around at the sparse collection, I find it a little hard to believe that a class would travel here from Providence, but I suppose New England isn’t typically known for its preponderance of German art periodicals. Regardless, the Center’s success will depend on the degree to which students at Harvard are able to engage with it. The challenge will be to bring in those who don’t already have a VES background or another point of entry. The few times I’ve been, I have yet to see a Harvard student browsing between classes, though small pink bookmarks dotting the store are tokens of at least one Harvard group’s involvement. These annotated fluorescent slips denote class picks from a VES seminar being conducted this semester by Voorhies.
Titled “Falling from the Grip of Grace: A Critical Reading of Contemporary Art and Exhibitions,” Voorhies’ class is meant to be an educational experience integrated into the Carpenter Center’s latest initiatives, which also include an exhibition of work by the British video artist Phil Collins. On March 24, the class held a public screening and open seminar to engage the community in conversation about contemporary art and curatorial spaces. Collins’s videos had a jagged beauty, cutting across sentimentality to depict moments of real tenderness. Kids make out messily at music festivals, senior citizen ballerinas practice to a slow indie rock song, and Palestinian teenagers bounce and strut during an eight-hour disco dance-off in these documentary- and performance-based videos.
Upstairs, in the black box behind the bookstore that was constructed for this exhibit, seminar participants in owlish glasses debated the difference between the role of the artist and the documentarian. One feisty Cambridge adult, declaring himself a psychologist, argued, “You’re always interfering with behavior as long as you’re observing it.” He was not surprised by the footage from Palestine, like another woman, who was moved to see the humanity in a region usually discussed in terms of violence and political upheaval. “Every country has their own propaganda machine,” she remarked. “Yeah, if you buy into it,” the man responded. “I certainly don’t.”
It was encouraging to see interested and, perhaps, culturally starved Cantabrigians entering a dialogue with Harvard students in such a dynamic environment. The Motto Books pop-up, too, fills an offbeat niche in the arts community at Harvard and, if it lives up to Nam’s and Voorhies’ goals, could offer a way to rethink the expected consumer experience. Indeed, the Carpenter Center and its new Consumer Research Center/ offer a unique space to Harvard, and not just as a place to go when you are bored of the selection at the Harvard Book Store. The building is worth a visit, but be warned: There are no Sperrys or salmon shorts to be found here.

In the spring of 1779, a third year Harvard student named Phillip Draper found himself suddenly exiled from Cambridge.
Draper took leave from the University not for a vacation from the rigors of 18th century college life, but as part of his rustication—a disciplinary practice of sending particularly unruly undergrads to the countryside, not uncommon at Harvard at the time. Students who were rusticated had the opportunity to return to college, but only if their petitions to do so were accepted.
Though the spidery-inked letters relating to Draper’s rustication are mum on the specifics of his exile, over the decades that the punishment was doled out, some students were sent to work out their misbehavior at a Concord farm, while others were put under the care of local ministers for clerical work. The terms of return to college were always uncertain, if they existed at all: The records are rife with testimonials on good behavior and pleading letters requesting return to the college following rustication.
The details may have varied, but the theme was clear: Get too drunk, unruly, or wild (which, yes, in those days included the occasional student rebellion, duel, or out-of-lab explosion)—and you no longer belonged at Harvard.
Draper certainly fit the mold of a problem student. In the late 1770s, with a few disciplinary marks on his record, Draper was already a likely candidate for banishment to the countryside—and that was before the Saturday afternoon in 1779 when Draper and some friends imbibed “wine to excess” and began making “an indecent & tumultuous noise to the Dishonor & Disturbance of the College.”
After tutors reprimanded the noisy, inebriated students—twice—the party moved to Draper’s room, and then a forbidden gaming house in town, before the tutors finally succeeded in shutting it down. Before long, Draper was rusticated, and, despite pleas from a number of reputable character references (including Draper’s anxious mother), he remained exiled from college for more than a year.
At one point, the University rejected Draper’s proposed return on the legitimate-sounding grounds that, “we can repose no kind of confidence in his declarations, they appearing contradictory, and as he has repeatedly violated his promises.” The rural penance would continue.
Parties like Draper’s epic meandering bash (as well as Harvard Hall bonfires and pistol fights in the Yard) seem to be frequent nuisances of the era, reliably prompting fines and demerits. But University records show that, in the 18th and 19th centuries, students were rusticated for a variety of infractions, from “riotous party behavior”  (in the cases of Daniel Oliver, Jonathan White, and John Hunt in 1761) to “breaking open a college chamber with an axe” (Cornelius Durant Maynard, 1809). In 1838, the poet (and infamously misbehaved undergrad) James Russell Lowell was banished via rustication, forcing him to miss the recitation of his own poetry scheduled for Class Day.
Perhaps the most sober (literally and figuratively) of crimes deemed worthy of rustication were the several rebellions which marked the era, in which politically-minded students protested everything from the serving of rancid butter in dining halls to a new policy of mandatory recitations levied by a group of overeager tutors. The latter—which would come to be known rather grandiosely as the start of the Rebellion of 1768—prompted three days of student disorder, including a gathering under the long-gone “Liberty Tree” which once stood stalwart before Hollis Hall.
Eventually, the festive protests led to the rustication of a student, Thurston Whiting. Whiting had falsely accused a tutor of locking him in a room for several hours, and would soon, presumably, have some long hours of work in the country to spend thinking about his crimes.
On the other hand, four other students were temporarily expelled for “breaking windows” during the incident; Whiting’s removal to the countryside seems a light punishment in comparison. Perhaps that bit of perspective is needed to comprehend the seemingly bizarre punishment of rehabilitating problem students through an indefinite period of toil in the countryside—after all, Harvard undergrads in just a slightly different era could have been publicly flogged for their misdemeanors.

“Communism” can be a contentious term; it’s often leveraged as an insult against political or economic stances that may not actually fit a strict definition of the term. From a historian’s point of view, what does the legacy of Communism actually mean for the world today? George F. Baker III Professor of Russian Studies Terry Martin answered some questions about Communism as it appeared in Russia and discussed how the policy affects current international relations.
Fifteen Minutes: What are some common misconceptions about the term “Communism,” as you understand from a historical perspective?
Terry Martin: I would say that, typically, socialism and communism have sometimes in America been equated. We’re actually in an interesting phrase right now because, in some ways, the Communist Revolution in Russia, which was initially called the Socialist Revolution—it sort of took over the term socialism and defined it in those terms. Now we’re seeing those communist notions of socialism being revived.
FM: As someone who teaches on nationality and empire, what are some key takeaways from the fall of Communism in the USSR?
TM: In terms of economics, even though the Soviet system implemented a particular variation of socialism—that is, the one in which state ownership of means of production was primary as opposed to various social justice notions that came more to the fore in Western democracy—that definitely showed there were certain mythologies about that kind of economic organization; in particular, the pathology of the shortage economy... once the state takes over the economy and turns it into a political operation, you pretty much inevitably have problems of shortage and hoarding at all levels of the economy, and that introduces an inefficiency that all attempts to reform Communism that did not involve an introduction of a market economy, as in China, ultimately reproduced. This is something that the youth like you, who are now apparently interested in socialism, have to come to grips with.
In terms of nationalities, which is what I wrote my first book about, very few people are aware that the 15 countries that emerged from the USSR by and large didn’t exist in 1917, or existed only in embryo, and were a consequence of the Soviet organization of the country on national principles. It was actually the Soviet government that set up these units that became the independent states, not states that were conquered.
FM: How would you define the legacy of communism as it affects international relations today?
TM: To say something broad, which is more interesting: the Eurasian continent is the place in which the rebellion against Western liberal capitalism occurred in the 20th century. And the major manifestation of that rebellion came with the Communist revolutions in Russia and China. So they manifested themselves as a rebellion against the economic order, but also against the geopolitical domination of the Western capitalist nations that emerged with the remarkable success of the industrial revolution in those countries. You could say that the Iranian revolution and Islamism came out of that same rebellion—that is, empires that became colonial possessions in the 19th century rebelled in multiple ways. What we’re seeing is in some ways a new phase of that conflict.
In many ways, Communism was anti-colonial as well as economically driven. Even in Russia, it felt itself in 1917 under immense pressure from Western Europe and in a semi-colonial relationship—or, at least the Bolsheviks viewed it that way. So the Chinese responded to the declining success of socialism by creating the so far fantastically successful hybrid of political communism and economic liberalism. They cannot only continue the anti-colonial struggle, but also became a great power, sort of like Soviet Union did. But unlike the Soviet Union, they are running a capitalist economy.

“You want to talk about problems? I’ve got problems. I mean, in an ontological sense, I don’t have problems. But I do.”
Shmuel Yosef Agnon Professor of Dúnedain Argy­Bargy Scoops L. McClure relaxes into a sort of glutinous armchair he’s painstakingly carved from a malformed corn muffin. He sighs and rebuttons his very small blazer—an impressive feat, considering that he does not, technically speaking, exist.
Professor McClure’s office is or is not located on the third level of the Lamont Café pastry stand, right below the danishes, but above the croissants. Its walls are decorated with crumbs, a sticky residue that seems to be raspberry filling, and a series of Dürer prints.
With discontent among non­existent professors affecting our campus climate in absolutely no way, I recently made my way to Professor McClure’s office in order to get to the bottom of this non­issue.
“When you hear the word ‘professor,’ you think of Jill Lepore. David Malan. Homi Bhabha,” McClure says. “You don’t think of Reginald Wapshot. You don’t think of Farp Fettypogger. You don’t think of me. And I think that’s a little unfair.”
McClure asserts that non­existent professors are generally divided between two camps, the purely fictitious, like himself, and what he calls “anti­professors,” essentially one­-off jokes that rely on the inversion of a real professor’s name and characteristics. He lists, as examples, Elaine Soothing, Philip  Lobsterman, and James Stone, widely reviled as the absolutely worst English-­language critic of his generation.
“Within the non­community, [anti­professors] are a bit of a joke,” McClure explains.
At one point during our conversation, an enormous hand opens the pastry stand and reaches inside; McClure is forced to wield a battered­-looking toothpick, swatting at the hand, lest his sole piece of furniture end up in a very real gullet.
When the hand retracts, McClure sits down again, his delicate coiffure disheveled, his blazer torn. “This is what we have to deal with,” he says.
He explains that the concept of non­existent professors is a passable premise with a lot of semi­humorous real­-world parallels that don’t provoke any thought. For instance, when he entered the room where he was to teach a class on Faulkner’s Louisiana limericks this spring, he found the room—the dispensing tray of the leftmost vending machine in the basement of the Kennedy School—completely empty.
“I spent three hours in there,” McClure says. “Because the flap mechanism only opens from the outside.”
While he admits that the tenure track for actual flesh ­and ­blood professors can be  stressful and discouraging, he believes it’s even more difficult for those professors who lack any sort of ground of being.
“People were always telling me, ‘You can’t do it. You can’t be a professor.’ And they were right, but also, I think, wrong. I didn’t do it. And I’m not. But I’m not not doing it, and I definitely didn’t undo it, and if I really weren’t, who wouldn’t not be?”
“That doesn’t make any sense,” I say.
“No,” he agrees, “it doesn’t.”

FROM BUTCHER'S TO BREWER'S
John’s father was Robert Harvard, who lived in Southwark, England, and worked as a butcher and tavern owner to support his nine children. As many stories set in the early 1600s in England go, this one was violently interrupted by an outbreak of bubonic plague, and the family was whittled down to John, one brother, and Robert’s wife Katherine Rogers, who inherited her husband’s wealth and property.
Robert Harvard’s tavern was an old building, mentioned as far back as 1452 by the name of the Crossed Keys. Sometime in the next century, with the English looking less kindly on an establishment named after the papacy’s coat of arms, the name was changed to the Queen’s Head. When Rogers, surviving her second and third husbands, passed away, the Harvard estate made its way into the hands of John, a newly-minted Emmanuel College grad from England on his way to the New World.
Long life spans did not grace any member of the Harvard family. At just 30 years of age, only a year after after arriving in Charlestown, John succumbed to consumption. On his deathbed, John dictated his will to his wife, Ann Sadler. Half of his fortune went to Sadler, and the rest went to the fledgling college across the river in Newtowne. His generous donation prompted the grateful recipients to decree in the college’s charter that “the Colledge agreed upon formerly to bee built at Cambridg shalbee called Harvard Colledge.”
The Queen’s Head’s future, following the death of its childless proprietor, is far murkier than that of Harvard Colledge. Several hundred years later, in 2005, while playing a Harvard trivia game, a group of undergraduates stumbled upon the fact that John Harvard had bequeathed to the College, upon his death, a pub by the name of the Queen’s Head. They eagerly reported this to the team then elbow-deep in plans for a bar underneath Memorial Hall, which decided to name the new establishment in honor of this ancient college relic.
This version of the story then explains how the English pub fell victim to a great fire in 1676. The Queen’s Head, among other buildings, was “burn'd down, blown up, and wholly destroyed,” according to a 17th-century report.  This tale of death-by-fire was included in the original website of the modern Queen’s Head, although they list date as 1886 instead, and a 2007 Crimson article listed it as 1876. There’s some confusion as to whether the pub even burned down at all. Photographs of the pub from 1881 exist, so if it did, it certainly wasn’t until then.
An account of the pub’s history in The Inns of Old Southwark and Their Associations reports that the deeds between 1637—around when John Harvard acquired the establishment—and 1650 are actually missing, making it hard to say for certain who actually owned the pub, Harvard Colledge or otherwise.
Frank W.C. Hersey ’99, an English instructor, gave a talk in Adams in 1935 in which he touched upon the particulars of John Harvard’s history. Hersey purported that John sold the Queen’s Head to fund his journey to the colonies, which would explain the large sum of money Harvard managed to possess upon his death.
This story has a less dramatic finish. The Queen’s Head passed through several owners and even had a brief stint as spillover space for a grammar school before entering the charge of a local brewer, where it remained until it was scheduled for demolition and summarily torn to the ground.
AN EVENING WITH LOKER
While it is difficult to say whether “the Colledge” found the issue of social spaces on campus to be particularly pressing, the Harvard College of 2005 was plagued with an all too familiar issue—fun on campus had been relegated to the few, leaving the many out to starve.
This phenomenon could be observed in Loker Commons, better known today as the basement of Annenberg Hall. In 1992, Katherine Bogdonovich Loker gave the University a $7 million donation to create a new student center. Despite high expectations, the Commons were quickly relegated to a space for problem sets and FlyBy lunches. The Commons were usually barren come the weekend.
With an unhappy and under-partied campus on his mind, then-Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’72 set out to revitalize the space. He turned to his current special assistant and recent graduate, Zac Corker ’04, to spearhead the offensive. Corker in turn gathered about him a team of undergraduates, who breathed life back into the dreary campus with the creation of Harvard Pub Nights.
Harvard Pub Nights were to be raucous events, featuring cheap food and drink and live entertainment. Corker’s team partnered with Harvard Student Agencies on the food and Veritas Records on the music. The first Pub Night took a month to plan but turned out to be a massive success.
“Pub Night could quite possibly be one of the best things to happen to the social scene at Harvard in a long time. Cheap beer, live music, food, and lots of friends—it almost sounds like what you might find at a college bar in a college town,” wrote the Crimson in 2005. The first night drew in more than 1,000 attendees. Pub Nights became a biweekly affair, with Corker reporting more than 4,500 total students in attendance at the first five events.
The student body, despite Corker’s triumph, was not ready to stop at Pub Nights. Many took the success of the events as an indication that Loker Commons was ready for much more.
Corker, now wielding the title of “Fun Czar,” agreed. “The success of Pub Nights is a clear indicator that Loker Commons, with the right adjustments, can be a real center for student life,” he wrote in an email in 2005. With support from William C. Kirby, then the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Gross, plans to renovate Loker Commons into a permanent campus pub were put into motion. Riding the momentum of Pub Nights, Corker himself was put in charge of the project.
With the renovation, the administration doubled down on its vision for a socially vibrant Loker Commons. The pub was to focus on programming and entertainment, boasting food and drink at hours and prices that appealed to the undergraduate community.
With the shadow of the failed Loker Commons renovation looming large, planners were careful and methodical with their preparations. Undergraduates played a role, helping determine the menu and aesthetic, and picking out a signature beer from a local brewery, which was named the “1636.”
The Queen’s Head opened, with ribbon cutting and associated fanfare, on April 19, 2007, to a crowd of just over 700. Menu items, in “floater or blocking group” sizes, ranged from “The Endowment” (appetizer sampler in the shape of an “H”) to “Freedom Fries.” And who would have the honor of the first pint? None other than Nick Stanton, Council Leader of Southwark, who flew in for the ceremony.
LIVE FROM THE PRESENT
Almost nine years later, Stanton and Gross have left, but Harvard remains embroiled in a campus-wide discussion about social spaces. Undergraduate and graduate leadership of final clubs met last spring to discuss ways to help bolster the college’s social scene, and among the meeting notes lay suggestions to expand “social programming at the Queen’s Head pub.”
The pub, almost entirely undergraduate-run, has been making moves for the past year to increase its presence on campus. According to Antonia S. Washington ’18, the Queen’s Head’s Food Manager, undergraduates are a particular focus.
Integrating weekly live music, performed by student bands, into its weekly repertoire, the Queen’s Head stage has seen performers ranging from dorm room names like Black Tie Affair and the Intrinsics to smaller outfits. Other weekly events have ranged from sassy trivia nights to karaoke (which is, unfortunately, done for the semester). In October, in coordination with other groups on campus, the Queen’s Head helped host the Haunted Hall party, complete with costumes.
Has this spike in programming correlated to a spike in pub attendance? “It definitely has,” Frank Zhou ’18, who’s been working at the pub since his freshman year, says, “We still have a long way to go, but we’re making great strides.”
Not only does the bar have offerings for undergraduates, who remain the major focus of event planning, but also for graduates, faculty, and staff. “It’s something really unique that you don’t really see on any other social space on campus,” Zhou says.
Still, attendance may skew towards the younger crowd. It is not atypical for freshmen to appear in the fall and then disappear for good. To combat this, the pub is working towards hosting and running more events that upperclassmen will find appealing.
The issue of social spaces at Harvard will not be solved overnight, by a single Fun Czar, or with the unveiling of a single new establishment. While Loker Commons is still not the bustling campus hub that Loker or Corker imagined, the Queen’s Head remains hard at work to bring about as much positive change as possible.
“I don’t know if we’ve nailed it, but we’re working on that,” Washington says.

“Soo­jong, you used to be so cute when you were little...”
It’s the last night of my visit to Korea. Thirty minutes ago, at 2 a.m., my mom had summoned me to her room, depriving me in the dead of winter of the warm comforts of my bed. I’m sitting cross­legged on laminate wood flooring; my butt is sore, and my right foot is numb from loss of circulation. The bedroom we’re in is barely large enough to fit both me and my mom’s supine body. In fact, the whole two­-bedroom apartment seems no bigger than my family’s living room in the States. Just about the only comfortable aspects of my situation are the soothing, rhythmic snoring of my grandmother in the other room and the fact that the floor is heated. Actually, no, the heating is not that great either: My lower half is burning up, and my upper half is freezing.
Wait, what did my mom say? When I was little, I used to be so cute. When I was little...
“Soo­jong... Soo­jong, are you listening?”
“Yes, yes, mom.”
“Soo­jong, did I ever tell you that story of you as a child?”
We both know this question is rhetorical. If my mom was known for anything, it was for her love of telling stories. All my mom’s phone calls would be hilariously one­-sided, with my mom ceding no time at all to her counterpart. I’ve often jokingly wondered if people were still on the line at the two-hour mark. Dinner parties with family friends would almost always devolve into story after story from my mom, jumping deftly between her two favorite topics: tales of her childhood and her experiences observing mine.
My favorite of her stories, which also happened to be her favorite to tell and the shortest one of them all, takes place during my first visit to Korea. It was two years after I was born. My parents had just come back to Korea after very little of the American Dream in the US. It was wintertime in Incheon, Korea. Since it was a weekend afternoon, my dad was naturally glued to the TV while my mom prepared dinner in the kitchen. My mom had to get “something”—the item would change every time she told this story—from the local mart. Customarily, she would take me with her, but, worried about the cold, she decided against it. Of course, being a toddler, I started bawling and begging her not to leave. After she assured me she would be back, my mom bundled up and left, and my dad told me to come into the bedroom so he could comfort me. I refused. With dried tears on my face and a runny nose, I resolutely sat next to the front door with my shoes on, lest anyone else be the first to greet my mom as she walked back through that door.
* * *
My unimpeachable devotion to my mother as a toddler—at least by her account—gave way for feelings of embarrassment in my grade­school years. Time after time, my mom would march into the teacher’s or principal’s office to demand in her broken English that something or other be changed. A combination of extreme stubbornness and love for one’s child will do that to a person, but I didn’t understand that at the time. I didn’t understand it when my mom argued with my first grade teacher that it was impossible for me to get an “Unsatisfactory” grade in writing mechanics. I didn’t really get it when my mom demanded I be allowed to skip kindergarten, despite the fact that I hadn’t attended preschool at all. I came home with an “Incident Report” because someone had thrown sand in my face, and I explained to my mom that I wasn’t the one that had done wrong. She went to school to demand it be expunged from my record anyway. My dad swears he heard sighs of relief from teachers when they saw only he would be showing up for parent­-teacher conferences.
Over time, my mom stopped intervening in my schooling. She started working 12 hours a day at my family’s dry cleaning business, and that marked an end to her frequent visits to my school. I was embarrassed no longer.
As she took a step back, there was a fundamental change in our relationship. I don’t mean that I stopped loving her. If love is defined by the people you would save during a hypothetical nuclear apocalypse, she was always the first person I would save. It was different in the sense that I took her for granted and didn’t always feel the need to interact with her. I would be at my computer working on homework when she would trudge up the stairs just after 7 o’clock. We would exchange greetings and eat at the dinner table. I would go back to homework, while she would watch TV. We would talk again when she went to bed. Rinse. Repeat.
If she was walking up the stairs more slowly, I didn’t notice. If it was a bit more difficult for her to swallow her food, I didn’t notice. If her hand would twitch while she was altering clothes at the dry cleaners, I wasn’t there to see it. I didn’t notice any of these things until my parents came home one day and said my mom had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.
Parkinson’s disease is a nervous system disorder. The body stiffens; there are tremors in the hands, and the face shows little expression. In many cases, people with Parkinson’s have difficulty swallowing their food. The disease is not fatal, but it is currently incurable.
After hearing the news, I vowed that I would take better care of my mom. And I did, for a bit. But it didn’t last. I left for college, and, 3,000 miles away from my mom’s suffering, I felt a lack of urgency to connect with her. This time, the feeling was, at least outwardly, mutual. Parkinson’s made her sullen. She didn’t talk as much, and when she did, there was no storytelling. Our phone conversations were brief. When I visited home, she wanted to keep to herself. I shared close to nothing about my college life. In one notable instance, I cited federal law—FERPA—as the reason why I didn’t want to show her my sophomore fall grades. My dad got involved, and I eventually printed my grades out for her.
My mom stopped working, and that meant my dad had to manage the dry cleaning business full­-time. Worried about her being home alone, my grandmother from Korea stayed with us for couple-­month bursts. Eventually, the family decided that it made the most sense for my mom to go back to Korea with her mother until we figured out a more permanent solution.
* * *
It’s now been an hour, and my mom’s still going strong. It reminds me a lot of my younger days, when my mom would tell stories and lecture me for hours on end. She’s covered a lot of ground: a couple stories about her childhood, a story about when I was younger, and a discussion—mostly with herself—of the type of woman she would approve of me marrying.
I still haven’t told her much about my life. I know she would love to know more, despite her lack of enthusiasm. But at 3 a.m., I’m tired, and I want to go to sleep. Capitalizing on a long pause, I excuse myself and head to bed.
Three months later, I wake up midday to a call from my dad. My mom is having serious indigestion problems, so she is admitted to a hospital. Half a day later, she is pronounced dead.
In the last year, my head has been wracked with thoughts of what could have been if I had given my mom more attention since I started high school. I’m full of regrets about not going into detail about the friends I made at school and about not talking about the things I’ve learned in college. I could have called more often. But above all, I’m filled with guilt. I’m not necessarily guilty about not having interacted with my mom more when she was alive. I’m guilty thinking about what I would have done if she was still alive. How many more times would I have punted on interacting with my mom because I was tired? How many times would I have let her been silent, instead of trying to cheer her up?
I spend a lot of time imagining the little boy in Incheon waiting for his mom to come back. Just the thought of his mom leaving from his sight led him to tears. Who’ll break the news? His mom is not coming back.

John S. Reed, class of 1910, was in it for the money.
“I recall his telling me that he had two ambitions when he came to college,” a classmate of Reed’s said in the Academy Award-winning 1981 biopic “Reds.” “One was to be elected president of his class. He didn’t know anyone in his class. No one knew him. The other was to make a million dollars by the time he was 25.”
That would change. By Reed’s senior year of college, he would reject the narrow-minded Harvard aristocracy. He would take over club meetings and ruin dinner parties, overflowing with passionate rants about equality and the worker. Consumed with radicalism, he would dedicate his college career to sparking “an influx of discontent, of revolutionary ideas, of criticism and revolt.”
Less than 10 years after that, Reed would become one of the most prominent American communist leaders and writers of the early 20th century. In fact, he spent the decade after college in a propaganda-writing, labor-organizing, revolution-inciting frenzy. In 1913, he rode with Pancho Villa’s army, reporting on the Mexican Revolution. In 1917 he travelled to the USSR as an independent journalist, joining Lenin in the October Revolution. In 1919 he helped form the Communist Labor Party of America, serving as its international delegate.
By that time, John Reed had become a household name. His account of the Russian Revolution, “Ten Days that Shook the World”, was being taught in schools across the USSR. Those who had known him praised him as “the pulse of the young lion,” mourned him as “a Soviet Russian hero,” and pitied him as a victim of “the damned Bolsheviki.” When he died of typhus on Oct. 17, 1920, his body was buried in the Kremlin.
Reed wasn’t born a socialist, though. In fact, he was born into a typical upper middle-class family in Portland, Oregon on Oct. 22, 1887. Though he would eventually grow into a tall, broad-shouldered athlete—hazel eyes intense even in laughter—as a child he was sickly and bullied by his peers.

“I wasn’t much good at the things other boys were, and their codes of honor and conduct didn’t hold me. They felt it too, and had a sort of good-natured contempt,” Reed recalled in his memoir, “Almost Thirty.”  “One time, when I was on the editorial board of the school paper, a boy I was afraid of warned me not to publish a joking paragraph I had written about him—and I didn’t…” From a young age, Reed wanted nothing more than acceptance.
Before Reed was a fearless revolutionary, he was a lonely Harvard student. Before he wrote satire for “The Masses,” he wrote plays for the Hasty Pudding. Before he aspired to the Executive Committee of the Comintern, he tried to get punched by the Porcellian.
Before Reed denounced the aristocracy, he desperately wanted to join it.
John Reed was not born into the proletariat. He spent his earliest years mixing with Portland high society in his wealthy grandmother’s home, which he later described as “... a lordly grey mansion modelled on a French chateau, with its immense park, its formal gardens, lawns, stables, green-houses and glass grape-arbor, the tame deer among the trees…” His grandfather, Henry D. Green, had founded the Portland Gas-light Company, and purchased the estate in 1873 for $28,000 (equivalent to about half a million dollars today).
That prosperity was short-lived: Reed’s grandmother had expensive taste and a love of travel, and after her husband’s death she quickly spent the majority of the family fortune. Reed’s financial situation became even more precarious after a severe economic depression shook the United States in 1893. When Reed was only nine years old, his parents moved from the Green mansion to an apartment downtown. A few years later, Reed’s father became embroiled in a political scandal that provoked the ire of the Portland aristocracy—the final nail in the Reed family’s social coffin. 
Still, Reed attended some of the most expensive schools on the East Coast. At 16, he left Portland for a New Jersey boarding school, and in the fall of 1906 he enrolled at Harvard College. A few years later, his brother, Harry, followed. This prestigious education came at both a financial and an emotional cost: as Reed reminisced a decade later, “We never knew until later how much our mother and father denied themselves that we might go, and how [my father] poured out his life that we might live like rich men’s sons.”
Reed might have been able to afford the cost of tuition, but he could not hide his Western, middle-class roots: Harvard had an excellent nose for those masquerading as “rich men’s sons.”
William James described students like Reed in his 1903 essay  “The True Harvard.” Those who arrived  “from the remotest outskirts of our country, without introductions, without school affiliations,” had no place in Harvard’s social spaces, he said. “They seldom or never darken the doors of the Pudding or the Porcellian.”
As John M. Brown ’23 wrote in the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, the Harvard of 1906 was a place of “poor boys and rich boys; those favored because they were Brahmin-born and others penalized because they were not.” Most of Reed’s new peers had attended elite East Coast prep schools, and considered “new money”—or, worse, no money—beneath them. A boisterous nobody from Portland hardly stood a chance.
This never deterred Reed. A childhood on the (relative) social margins had conditioned him to value popularity, and a natural competitive instinct drove him to compete for it. He developed a fascination with Harvard’s aristocracy, and when he arrived on campus in the fall of 1906 he sought to join it.
“A furious energy drove me to all kinds of bodily and mental exercise, without any particular direction,” he wrote in his memoir. “I was increasingly active and restless, more ambitious of place and power, less exalted, scattering myself in a hundred different directions…” He wanted to be a poet. He wanted to be a novelist. He wanted to be a lover, and a fighter, and a rebel. More than anything else, he wanted to be accepted.
“During my freshman year I used to pray to be liked, to have friends, to be popular with the crowd,” Reed wrote.
To a lonely Harvard freshman at the turn of the twentieth century, popularity meant joining a Final Club.
The punch process began with admission to the Institute of 1770, an exclusive social organization which selected 100 men from the sophomore class each year and named them “the socially elect.” Becoming a member of the Institute meant prestige; it meant status; most of all, it meant eligibility for the next tier of exclusive social organizations, the Waiting Clubs. After election to a Waiting Club, juniors and seniors were eligible for an invitation to a Final Club—the apex of the whole system, and the playground of Harvard’s elite.
“To the ordinary freshman before whose eyes the plum of the Institute is dangled,” Reed wrote, “a Final Club seems the end of earthly ambitions.” 
It all hinged on the Institute. For Reed, though, getting in was easier said than done. When the Class of 1910 entered Harvard, it had nearly 700 members. The Institute would select only 100. Reed’s odds were bad from the start.
In search of a niche, Reed tried to join the freshman crew team. He committed a significant portion of his freshman year to the task, even staying on campus during holidays to row by himself, but he was the last rower eliminated before the end-of-year Harvard-Yale crew regatta and never technically made the team.
Reed’s initial forays into the arts community ended similarly fruitlessly. Though he’d later write books and articles hailed by nations, by the end of his freshman year he hadn’t been granted entry to a single campus publication.
“I got to know many fellows to nod to, and a very few intimately; but most of my friends were whirled off and up into prominence, and came to see me no more,” he reminisced in “Almost Thirty,” “Athletes and musicians and writers and statesmen were emerging from the ranks of the class. The Freshman clubs were forming. And I was out of it all.”
Reed was never invited to join the Institute of 1770. He never joined a Waiting Club, he never joined a Final Club, and he never really reached the upper echelons he’d aspired to as a freshman.
This exclusion was partially the product of class. Reed hadn’t been born into the eastern elite, and the eastern elite knew it.
Reed knew it, too. When he was rejected sophomore year for two posts for which he felt he “qualified easily”—an editorial position at The Harvard Crimson and the assistant managership of the Varsity Crew team—he chalked it up to snobbery and walked away bitter.
It wasn’t only Reed’s class, though: When Reed’s brother arrived to Harvard two years later, he was invited to join the same organizations that had overlooked his older sibling. The snub was also personal.
“There is a clue to his lack of acceptance, his lack of the quality the British call ‘clubable,’” wrote his classmate, Edward E. Hunt, class of 1910. “Through everything he did there ran a strand of the grotesque which turned the most serious event into laughter.”
Regardless of its cause, Reed took rejection hard.  “The thought that he could be considered inferior, unworthy of their attention no matter what he did, came as a numbing shock to him,” wrote Richard O’Connor in his biography of Reed, “The Lost Revolutionary.”
By sophomore year, Reed recalibrated. Rejected by the elites and no longer willing to measure personal success by class or wealth, he found a new strategy for social acceptance: joining as many extracurricular activities as possible. As he saw it, the class was divided into three neat groups: the athlete, the scholar, and the “activities man.” Reed knew which he wanted to join. 
In Reed’s model, athletes represented the pinnacle of the social hierarchy. “The average undergraduate would rather win his “H” than get Phi Beta Kappa,” he wrote in an essay. He wasn’t wrong: by 1907-08, Reed’s sophomore year, campus athletics had become such a dominant social force that President Eliot became concerned that sports were exhausting players, keeping fans from their studies, and encouraging “the betting evil.”
Despite his initial setbacks on the river, Reed enjoyed moderate athletic success on the field and in the pool. He was a member of the swimming team, captain of the water polo team, and song-leader of the cheerleading squad.
A former classmate, the Pulitzer prize-winning left-wing journalist Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, remembered Reed as the star of the cheerleading squad. “He would stand up alone before a few thousand undergraduates and demonstrate without a quiver of self-consciousness just how a cheer should be given,” Lippmann wrote in the New Republic in 1914. “If he didn’t like the way his instructions were followed he cursed at the crowd, bullied it, sneered at it. It was a sensational triumph for [John] Reed but wasn’t altogether good form at college.”
In the Russian Revolution, the ability to rouse a crowd would serve him well.
Still, Reed saw the athlete’s position in the campus hierarchy as that of an empty figurehead with no real power. He thought that the student that embodied Harvard’s most traditional values was really “the scholar:” “He is studying what the great Harvard men of the past have studied—he is really seeking what Harvard has stood for for three hundred years—Veritas.”
Reed himself barely scraped past Harvard’s entrance exams, and he left an undergraduate record dotted with C’s, D’s, and E’s (modern F’s). A self-confessed “indifferent student,” he found the classroom dry and lifeless. “Why should I have been interested in the stupid education of our time?” he asked. “We take young soaring imaginations, consumed with curiosity about the life they see all around, and feed them with dead technique.” He wrote a number of his essays on club or scrap stationary, perhaps as a deliberate snub.
Though Reed respected Harvard’s undergraduate scholars, he never wanted to befriend or become one. “Long lack of comradeship with any but those of his kind have made him intolerant of frivolity, have dried in him the natural desires and exaltations of youth, and therefore he is misunderstood and despised,” he wrote.
That left the “activities man.” Students active in extracurriculars had the social clout lacked by athletes and the social graces lacked by scholars. They embodied all the virtues a turn-of-the-20th-century ‘Harvard Man.’ “They are a community of enthusiasts, men of all trades,” he wrote. “They are dreamers and often poets. Their grades are often very poor mediocre and they subordinate college work to their “activities”.... They talk a great deal among themselves, exchanging ideas and thoughts, strengthening friendships and learning what real standards there are by which to judge a man.” The activities man was busy, plugged in, a member of all the clubs, an insider.
By the time of his graduation, Reed had joined so many extracurriculars that his class bio was longer than his (nonexistent) senior thesis. He managed the Glee Club; he joined the Debating Club; he was a member of such mysteriously named organizations as the Memorial Society, the Round Table, the Symposium, and the Oracle. At various points, Reed was a member of some 16 organizations and teams—an impressive number even by Harvard’s contemporary standard. 
Reed was the activities man.
Amongst these many organizations were a few campus publications. Despite his failed start at the Crimson, Reed became an editor at the Harvard Monthly, a literary magazine where his poems and stories, “juvenile and imitative though they were, won respect and praise and inspired enthusiastic prophecies,” according to Granville Hicks ’23. He was also a writer and “Ibis”—second-in-command—at the Lampoon. 
Reed was a leader as well as a writer. He had a gift for organizing people and executing visions—and he had no shortage of ideas.
Still struggling to reconcile his Portland upbringing with his Cambridge education, he became president of the Western Club. A casual eating club created to defy Harvard’s puritanical social norms, the organization became known for mischief and outrageous practical jokes. As President, Reed sat at the head of every table and introduced diners in increasingly ludicrous ways.
“Gentlemen, the future President of the United States!” he cried when Lippmann joined him one evening.
“Where have you bean?” he shouted at another friend, throwing a handful of beans.
Reed didn’t confine his antics to the Western Club. As Hicks reported, over the spring break of his junior year, a debacle involving a series of bars, “a resort of dubious reputation,” and a spontaneous trip to Bermuda resulted in Reed’s “rustication”—an archaic punishment based on exile to Concord, Mass. Reed spent the rest of the semester in time-out.
When not in Concord, Reed served as President of the Cosmopolitan Club. Founded by Reed on Feb. 12, 1908, the club united Harvard’s international students, entertained foreign dignitaries, and discussed world affairs. It was wildly successful: 53 students joined at its inception, and by Reed’s graduation in the spring of 1910 that number had grown to roughly 200.
Reed called it “one of the most important organizations ever formed among the students at Harvard.”
Then again, Reed had a taste for hyperbole. It showed up in his rhetoric, marked his prose, and, in the fall of his junior year, inspired the creation of the Dramatic Club.
The club provided Harvard’s budding playwrights with a stage. The school offered few opportunities to produce original student theater, and students taking playwriting courses—including Reed and his two co-founders, Edward Sheldon and Hans V. Kaltenborn—chafed at the limitation. Rather than trying to convince an existing troupe to produce student work, they decided to make their own.
The Dramatic Club was novel for another reason: it became the first theater group on campus to admit women to its ranks. The decision provoked controversy. Members felt that “if we expected to achieve any social distinction at Harvard with our newly organized club, we simply could not permit the participation of Radcliffe girls,” Kaltenborn recalled in his memoir, “Fifty Fabulous Years.” Eventually, these protests were eventually overlooked “in the interest of better drama,” and the Dramatic Club (antecedent of the contemporary Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club) went co-ed.
It’s easy to see traces of Reed’s later persona in his early college activities. By junior year, Reed was already an iconoclast, defying social mores and laughing at Harvard authority. He was an idealist, uniting his peers and planning to bring labor justice to the world. He was a leader, screaming at crowds in stadiums and theaters and pitting himself against the status quo.
But while he’d turned his eyes from the elites and become the “activities man” he’d always wanted to be, he was still searching for his cause. “John Reed was not a fiery left-winger in those days,” wrote Kaltenborn. “He was a nonconformist.”
Senior year, that changed.
In his final year of college, Reed discovered the Harvard Socialist Club. Founded by two freshmen in 1908, the club’s stated goal was to use the study and spread of socialism to correct the “fundamentally imperfect” state of society. At inception, it had nine members. 
Despite its modest size, the Club pledged to permeate the college. As Reed put it, “They sat not in lofty contempt above the ignorant student body, but mingled with it, learning its sympathies and weakness, used its machinery...” While club members held frequent discussions of their own, often continuing hours after midnight, they attempted to recruit and effect change by infiltrating other campus organizations.
This turned out to be an effective strategy. After less than five years, the Socialist Club had between 30 and 50 members. Two years after Reed’s graduation, a senior named Gerard C. Henderson, class of 1912, told the Harvard Graduates’ Magazine that the club’s “...fringes merge imperceptibly into a half-dozen political clubs, some adherents of such leaders as Wilson and La Follette, and others more vaguely representative of insurgency and progressivism.”
Reed was never officially a member, but the club still radicalized him. “It made me, and many others, realize that there was something going on in the dull outside world more thrilling than college activities,” he wrote.
Reed’s newfound politics were first evident in his writing. Reed had been writing for the Lampoon for a few years already, but during his senior year his sketches gained a biting political edge they’d lacked before.
In one Lampoon editorial, Reed mocked Harvard’s old money and gave advice to young men seeking to boost their pedigrees. “Hyphens are of immense value—remember that anyone will always be glad to lend money to an Endicott-Sears-Cabot, a Wendell-Wendell, or a Trumbull-Peabody,” he wrote. “If a child is too late to corral a Back Bay Brahman for a progenitor, let him seize upon a self-made man who has made a good job of it. Money will finally land anyone among the Captains of Society.”
Though Reed mocked them, the elite were beginning to notice him.
In the spring of Reed’s senior year, he was offered membership in the Hasty Pudding. The Pudding was one of the most exclusive social organizations on campus, made up almost entirely of members of Waiting and Final Clubs, and to Reed the invitation must have seemed like a baffling reversal on the part of the aristocracy. Certainly, he had distinguished himself in the years since he’d first been overlooked, but he was still the same brash Westerner he’d always been.
In truth, the Hasty Pudding didn’t have much of an option. It was nearly time for the club’s annual musical, and none of its existing members—who had been selected on the basis of social status—felt capable of writing lyrics. Reed was a necessary outside hire, and he knew it.
The Hasty Pudding put on an uncharacteristically subversive show that year.
“Just insist that your aunt was a Cabot,
And your grandmother’s real name was Weld.
Try hard to make rudeness a habit,
And be careful with whom you’re beheld.”
Suddenly, Reed was a “club man.” A critical one, certainly, but a club man all the same. And as much as he tried to suppress it, he found satisfaction in the title. That satisfaction became evident at the end of his senior year. 
In 1910, Harvard’s rich lived in glamorous private apartments on Mt. Auburn Street; the poor lived in dorms in Harvard Yard. This dichotomy influenced more than sleeping arrangements: Residents of the Street controlled most aspects of undergraduate life, and overwhelmingly filled class offices at graduation. That year, Reed was their nominee for Ivy Orator.
Then, the Yard revolted. In an explosion of resentment that had been brewing since freshman fall, the Yard refused to accept the Street’s nominations for class office. Residents of the Yard circulated petitions and submitted their own nominees instead.
Reed was stuck. He already considered himself a man of the people, but aligning himself with the Yard would undo all of his recent social progress. So he ran on behalf of the Street, and like almost every other Street candidate, he lost.
There had been a revolution, and he was on the wrong side.
Reed realized his mistake once it was already too late. Shortly after his graduation, he wrote a sweeping 73-page tract called “The Harvard Renaissance,” in which he describes the rise of socialism at the college. In that text, he calls the victory of the Yard “a vote of the unrepresented majority against its traditional leaders.” It is the story of the Marxist struggle in all but name.
College was Reed’s first introduction to the vapid nature of the privileged class. “The more I met the college aristocrats, the more their cold cruel stupidity repelled me,” he wrote in his memoir. “I began to pity them for their lack of imagination, and the narrowness of their glittering lives—clubs, athletics, society.
“College is like the world; outside there is the same class of people, dull and sated and blind.”
Three years later, Reed spoke on behalf of silk workers in Paterson, N.J., earning himself his first jail term and a reputation as a radical communist. Frustrated but not deterred, he allied himself with the trade union International Workers of the World and organized thousands of workers into a strike benefit in Madison Square Garden. By the late 1910s, the American government feared him. The USSR hailed him as a genius and taught his name in schools.
Richard M. Nixon didn’t call Harvard “the Kremlin on the Charles” for nothing. John Reed might have practiced socialism in New York City and St. Petersburg, but he learned it in the Yard.
Reed’s life was prime martyr material, and Harvard’s later left-wingers ate it up—“John Reed Clubs” began popping up across the United States only shortly after the man’s death.
Harvard had a branch, too. Calling itself a Marxist study and action group, the Harvard John Reed Society was founded in 1932 by “a group of undergraduates attracted by the personality of John Reed and interested in studying sciettific [sic] socialism, the cause for which he gave his life.” Though it was never widely popular, the club lingered for years. In 1943, it even published several issues of a magazine, The Harvard Vanguard. 
Reed’s mother did not approve. Charlotte J. Reed was always upset by John Reed Clubs—she found them exploitative.
Reed might have felt the same way. “In view of what has happened in Russia since the Revolution, I am certain that he would not have tolerated the use of his name as a means of ensnaring idealistic American youth into the Communist party,” Reed’s old friend and Dramatic Club co-founder Hans V. Kaltenborn, class of 1909, reflected in “Fifty Fabulous Years.” “That is what is being done at Harvard today. The John Reed Society has been little more than a cover for Communist party activities at Harvard since its inception.”
It wasn’t safe to join a club with such a reputation in McCarthy-era America. In 1950, the John Reed Society went underground.
According to The Boston Herald, the club had applied for a meeting room in the spring of 1950, and the administration had accepted. But when Dean Robert A. Watson reached out the following fall, he got crickets. No one would come forward to take the key.
“Last year’s president, Donald M. Long of New York, is no longer at Harvard, for academic reasons,” wrote the Herald. “Last year’s vice-president, Philip H. Ennis, said he is no longer associated with the club. Nobody else admits association.”
Harvard assured the public that it had not shut down the club, but students were suspicious. Arthur J. Sockol ’51, a senior who “identified himself as spokesman for the group,” wrote to The Boston Traveler. Though the university had allowed the club to continue functioning, he said, students feared retaliation.
The club was dead. And despite a smattering of radical left-leaning organizations that popped up throughout the ’60s and later—the Young Socialist Alliance, the Young People’s Socialist League, the Democratic Socialists of America—it stayed dead.
In 2016, the radical left has re-entered the conversation. Bernie Sanders, a presidential nominee who calls himself a “democratic socialist,” is experiencing widespread success, particularly among young voters.  In the Iowa primary, 84 percent of Democratic voters aged 17-29 supported Sanders. In the New Hampshire primary, that number was 83 percent. In a recent Chegg study of 1,363 college students, 6 percent self-identified as socialists.
Is John Reed’s crusade experiencing a revival? 
He Li ’16, president of Harvard Students for Bernie, considers it a question of semantics. “Obviously Bernie calls himself a democratic socialist, [but] what’s more important to everybody I’ve talked to are his specific policies and what he stands for,” Li said. “The label of socialist, that comes second.”
Others feel differently. “One of the long-lasting impacts of Bernie Sanders’ campaign is the way that… he’s been able to change the conversation around “the s-word,” Tyrik LaCruise ’17, an avid Sanders supporter, said. “Running as a democratic socialist, people are like ‘Whoa, wait a second. It’s not as dirty as I thought. The post office is socialism. Public schools? Socialism. We have roads. That’s socialism.’”
Paul Adler, a lecturer in Harvard’s History and Literature concentration, is intrigued by that reclamation. “The Sanders phenomenon is blowing my mind.... He calls himself a socialist. According to the polls of Democratic party voters, a lot of people are OK calling themselves socialists,” he said.  “Maybe it’s been enough time since the Cold War that there can be a renewed attempt at all this.”
If the Cold War and the Red Scare really are beginning to fade from cultural memory, then contemporary students might find themselves facing a form of socialism in some ways analogous to the one that faced Reed. After all, Reed grew up in a pre-Soviet world. As Adler pointed out, “People were scared of socialism and said negative things about it, but it had more a connotation of scary anarchy than totalitarianism.” The same could be said today.
In that case, perhaps we should take a close look at John Reed. His life reads like a short novel, gripping in its intensity and poignant in its brevity. He believed in an ideal, and it drove him through college, across Europe, and into the ground before he turned 33.
Adler suggests that we view the revolutionary as simultaneous warning and inspiration.
“I think the most truthful interpretation is that [Reed] encompasses both,” said Adler. “He’s a warning about the dangers of political idealism, about having a philosophy that the ends justify the means. But he’s also an inspiration about getting down in the muck and trying to create some sort of better society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a University-wide report condemned final clubs, the all-male A.D. Club will host an “open Punching process” next year, institute a members-only policy, and mandate University-advised  “sexual assault prevention training program” for its undergraduate members.
A.D. Graduate President Kenneth G. Bartels ’73 announced the sweeping changes to the club’s selection process in a message to all members on Tuesday obtained by The Crimson. Bartels wrote that that the policy changes were “in response to and in keeping with the recommendations of Harvard University’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault.” The task force’s report earlier this month sharply criticized all-male final clubs for their membership policies, high prevalence of “nonconsensual sexual contact” among female undergraduate seniors who participated in the groups’ activities, and for contributing to what the report called a “culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission.” 
Bartels wrote that “the Graduate Board took no action on the single-gender character of the club.” Last fall, in the face of administrative pressure to go co-ed, undergraduates in the A.D. indicated they strongly opposed any membership changes in an email to their graduate leadership.
The A.D.’s new policies will alter the recruitment process for new members. Punch, the weeks-long selection process for final club membership each fall typically involves multiple rounds of cuts and events and has traditionally been invite-only.
The club will also close its doors to guests—apart from family members—a policy at least one group employed last year in the face of increased scrutiny from the College.
The A.D. will augment anticipated College-required annual sexual assault prevention training for all undergraduates with club specific training. Bartels wrote that the club would “liaise with the University to tailor our training program to ensure that we address this matter effectively.”
Bartels wrote that the Graduate Board, Trustees, Undergraduate officers and Steward of the A.D. club met on March 24 to discuss the new policy changes. In his message this week, Bartels directed club questions or comments to the five-member “Task Force on the Future of the A.D. Club.”
The A.D.’s policy changes may represent an effort to avoid further scrutiny from College administrators who have refused to rule out any option in order to compel the clubs to go co-ed and alter their membership selection processes.
The University task force’s report on sexual assault prevention encouraged the College to “engage with the Final Clubs toward the objective of nondiscriminatory and open membership practices. “If those conversations fail to make progress, or if the transition by the Clubs to open and nondiscriminatory membership practices fails to address the issues we have identified in this report, we believe the University should not rule out any alternative approaches,” the report continued.
A subsidiary report from the Task Force’s Outreach Subcommittee suggested one such alternative: banning undergraduate enrollment in final clubs.
The A.D. Club detailed the policy changes on Tuesday, the same day that College administrators met with undergraduate leaders of the final clubs. During that meeting, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana issued an April 15 deadline for the clubs to inform administrators as to whether or not they will go co-ed.
Just last week, some A.D. graduate leaders met with Khurana. Khurana, Bartels, and Walker Kirby ’16, an undergraduate member of the A.D.’s task force, declined to comment on whether the April 15 deadline was discussed during their meeting or whether administrators requested any of the new policies.
Earlier this fall, A.D. Club member Walter Foulke ’61, drafted a memo outlining a potential legal defense should the College attempt to force changes in club membership policy.

EdX, a virtual education platform co-founded by Harvard and MIT, recently launched a financial aid program, allowing financially disadvantaged students to receive a 90-percent discount on verified course certificates.
While it is free to enroll in courses, users are required to pay fees that range from $50 to $100 in order to earn a verified certificate from an institution upon completing a course. Until last December, edX students had the option of earning a free “honor code certificate” for  courses they audited, but the company discontinued that option.
Now, as of December, students have the option of applying for financial assistance for verified certificates from edX—the four-year-old non-profit provider of massive online open courses that now boasts more than 90 partners from around the globe.
In order to receive a discounted credential, interested online learners must submit an application that is evaluated “holistically” by an edX support team, according to edX CEO Anant Agarwal. In the application, users must report an annual household income and write short essays about their financial situations, learning goals, and career aspirations.
“It’s really remarkable how much effort people put into this, which is why we think we have a really good program on our hands,” Agarwal said. “We just started the program four months ago and have been getting several hundred applications a week.”
Although edX and its partner universities have supported the idea of financial aid, Agarwal said the program is “complicated to administer,” especially given that it is funded by in-house dollars at a non-profit organization.
“Our financial aid program is not sustainable,” Agarwal said. “Right now we are funding it out of donor dollars. Our hope is that we get philanthropic contributions to help with our financial program.”
EdX announced its decision to offer financial assistance shortly before researchers Justin Reich and John A. Hansen released the results of a study that found a strong correlation between higher socioeconomic status and the likelihood of completing MOOCs. Reich and Hansen studied users enrolled in 68 Harvard and MIT courses offered through edX.
Robert A. Lue, the faculty director of HarvardX, the University’s branch of edX, emphasized that the new program increases access to certification rather than content for truly “committed” online learners.
“Free access is there now, as it always was,” Lue said.

As freshmen interested in Economics flood the department’s Advising Fortnight events this week and next, they will interact with a department whose system of advising looks very different than it did five years ago.
While the College’s largest concentration has tended to receive low marks on the advising portion of the annual senior survey, those scores have gradually risen since the department made changes to the way it advises, according to Economics Director of Undergraduate Studies Jeffrey A. Miron,
Before Kiran Gajwani was hired as a full-time adviser in 2010, the department relied on graduate students for its advising. Now five full-time advisers with economics Ph.D.s, like Gajwani, oversee advising. 
“They’re both people who have more experience in advising [and] people who have more of an investment in advising as opposed to a graduate student,” Miron said of the advisers.
While each adviser is assigned two or three Houses that they visit several times during the year, students can contact any of the advisers and attend drop-in office hours every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m..
Gajwani, who is assigned to the Houses in the Radcliffe Quad, said she has been able to interact more with students because of the House assignment system.
"We have the House designation because we actually go to the Houses certain times of the year and we try to engage in House activities,” Gajwani said. “Because of that, I think we tend to get to know the students in our Houses a bit better and that’s sort of the idea."
In addition to the hires, Miron said the advising program has created more organized activities for concentrators with the aim of improving their experience. These include a annual end-of-year picnic, alumni panels, and catered lunches for small groups of concentrators and faculty members.
While these resources exist for the department’s many concentrators, according to adviser Anne N. Le Brun, they are primarily opt-in.
"It is a large concentration, and we have the resources and the desire to connect with the students, but we’re not going to drag them out of their room and say ‘you have to have an advising conversation with us every week,’" she said.
Economics concentrator Samarth Gupta ’18 said while he has found the advisers very helpful and accessible, having such a skewed ratio of students to advisers is challenging.
“It’s harder for them to reach out and really make the concentration a transformative experience for each of the students and it’s easy for students to kind of skirt by and that’s where you get the stereotype of economics being pretty easy, because you can make it easy,” Gupta said.
Gajwani said grouping concentrators in smaller subgroups helps make the concentration feel more intimate.
“Because we’re a large concentration, something we've tried to do is think about communities of our concentrators,” she said, citing as examples senior thesis writers and groups of students in the same sophomore tutorial.
Both Gajwani and Le Brun stressed that the new system allows for greater consistency in a student’s advising experience.
“There’s a certain feeling of continuity and commitment to the job that is not necessarily there when you have just grad students doing it,” Le Brun said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As discussions of sexual assault and Title IX pervade campus rhetoric, Harvard Law School alumna and activist Kamilah Willingham offered her views on the topics and reflected on her experiences at a conference Tuesday.
The conference, entitled “Challenges in Title IX Advocacy,” was the first from Harassment/Assault Law-School Team, a new organization of Law School students that advocates for students who file sexual assault claims through internal procedures at schools in the Boston area.
Willingham, who gave the keynote address, was featured in the 2015 documentary “The Hunting Ground,” which criticizes Harvard's response to Law School student Brandon J. Winston’s alleged sexual assault of Willingham and her friend. In November, 19 professors at the Law School signed an open letter calling the documentary’s portrayal of the facts in the case “unfair and misleading.” 
In her address, Willingham spoke about her recent letter responding to the 19 professors that she released on the online publishing platform Medium.
“From you, I expect more,” Willingham wrote in her letter.
Willingham said she was grateful to speak at the conference.
“I felt both immensely supported and heartbroken by the number of students who came to listen and who expressed how they related to my experience,” she wrote in an email.
Jenae S. Moxie, a Law School student and the president of HALT, spoke during a panel discussions about her disillusionment with the Law School’s ability to educate students about sexual assault.
“I have lost my faith in the potential for the Law School or its curriculum to put out people who care deeply about things,” Moxie said.
Moxie said that, although classes such as Law lecturer Diane L. Rosenfeld’s “Gender Violence, Law, and Social Justice” were promising exceptions to that pattern, she still believed activism from students would ultimately bring about change at the Law School.
“It’s largely through students who advocate for changes in the curriculum and diversity of professors that you can actually have a conversation about decent moral people who care about justice in the world,” Moxie said. “We have people who are making noise and making actual changes.”
Rosenfeld also praised student activism to improve the sexual assault climate at the Law School and other universities.
“Student activism and student connectivity is critically important,” she said. “We’re members of the Harvard community, and we have a lot of credibility in the world, whether it’s deserved or not. ”
However, in addition to student activism, Rosenfeld said she is optimistic about the potential positive effects of her curriculum.
“I have the incredible privilege and luxury of creating my own curriculum, and having created the gender violence program,” Rosenfeld said. “I wanted to develop Title IX as an incredibly strong potential source of civil rights in education.”
HALT’s conference comes in the wake of ongoing debate about sexual assault and Title IX compliance at the Law School and the University more broadly. In 2014, the Law School was found in violation of Title IX for its “current and prior” policies on sexual harassment. Earlier this month a University task force released a wide-ranging report that offered recommendations to help reduce the “troubling” prevalence of sexual assault across Harvard’s schools.

As the deadline for a new agreement between Harvard and its dining services employees looms in June, student organizations have ramped up efforts to show support for workers affected by the round of talks.
This week, the Student Labor Action Movement—an undergraduate organization that has previously hosted events for campus unions—launched a website to serve as an online hub for their efforts. Dubbed the “One Harvard Campaign,” the website includes material about the group’s push to create a coalition of Harvard students, faculty, and staff rallying behind the goals of higher wages and more health care benefits for workers at the University.
The campaign emphasizes the interconnectedness of Harvard worker issues and student life, Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18 said.
“The basic idea is that it’s a sort of very simple way of showing that we are a community,” Hodgkin said. “It’s a small way of showing that we know that what affects them affects all of us.”
In order to illustrate those connections, SLAM launched a social media campaign Monday to encourage students to post selfies with dining staff on various social media accounts tagged with the hashtags #HUDSlove, #OneHarvard, and #WorkingForaHealthyHarvard. The third is the same hashtag members of the graduate student unionization effort use to publicize their campaign.
In addition to the selfie campaign, SLAM partnered with the Harvard College Democrats to host a panel on health care Tuesday night. HUDS workers discussed their individual experiences with health care benefits while students from the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School presented information on recent health care trends.
College Democrats and SLAM have increasingly collaborated over the course of the semester, members said. Last week, members of SLAM, with support from the College Democrats, presented University President Drew G. Faust with a letter encouraging her to support campus dining staff in their upcoming negotiations. In February, the College Democrats reiterated their commitment at a “Speak Out Event” hosted SLAM hosted.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, the campus outreach director for the College Democrats, noted that the collaboration stems from an overlap in club membership.
“I think there’s always been a recognition of that connection, but in this newest campaign, we really want to formalize it,” he said.
SLAM and the College Democrats are set to join members of the Graduate Student unionization movement and other campus organizations at an event next week called “Stop the Leaky Pipeline” which will focus on hiring practices at Harvard.

UPDATED: March 31, 2016, at 11:15 a.m.
In an effort to combat stagnant science research funding, members of the Harvard graduate student union effort are publicizing a petition asking the 2016 presidential candidates to prioritize STEM funding a part of their platforms.
The Harvard group—called the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—held a panel event Wednesday to draw attention to a nationwide campaign and petition started at Columbia urging the U.S. government to increase funding to research for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. 
Taliesen Lenhart, a laboratory technician in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department who said she supports the unionization effort, asked panelists about the next steps after the delivery of  the petition. Sarah Schlotter, a graduate student from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said although some presidential candidates may disregard the petition, the push behind the petition will be too strong to ignore.
Jack M. Nicoludis, another panelist who acts as a spokesperson for the HGSU-UAW and is a graduate student in the Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, reflected on frustration many students felt because of limited funding.
“We see our [principal investigators] writing grants after grants after grants, we see the pressure to get published and the competition that’s involved,” Nicoludis said, referencing the efforts of the lead researcher in a laboratory. “These are all a result of this small pot of money that’s being distributed in the wrong way.”
Schlotter also discussed the societal impacts of “insecure” research funding. Since 2013, when the federal government enacted wide-ranging budget cuts known collectively as sequestration, Harvard has seen a steady decline in federal research funding.
“Science and research funding are essential to our economy, are essential to solving today’s problems of new diseases like Zika, of climate change, and without science we’re just going to drop behind,” Schlotter said.
The HGSU-UAW has also launched a “white board” campaign aimed at STEM funding issues. Supporters were asked to fill in a blank sheet of paper that says, “I support STEM research funding because...”
Andrew B. Donnelly, a graduate student in the English Department and member of the HGSU-UAW, said he attended the event because of his involvement with the union.
“We’ve had huge numbers of students in the humanities departments and across the whole university who have signed this STEM petition who would otherwise have never known about this issue or felt strong enough to sign it,” Donnelly said.
The roughly 30 attendees included students and workers from all backgrounds, not all of whom were involved with the unionization effort. Schlotter said attendees did not have to support the union to sign the petition.

In response to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s vote earlier this month to increase prices, the Undergraduate Council will provide full funding for round trips on the T to student organizations requesting transportation grants to match the hiked fare.
The UC’s Finance Committee voted unanimously Wednesday to increase the maximum UC transportation subsidy student organizations may receive from $4.20 per person to $4.50 per person, reflecting the increase in MBTA fares.The committee’s vote follows the decision of the MBTA’s Fiscal and Management Control Board on March 7 to make fares more expensive. Beginning July 1, the cost of a T ride with a CharlieTicket will increase from the current $2.65 per ride to $2.75, while the fare with a CharlieCard will increase from $2.10 to $2.25.
“Traditionally, the UC transportation funding has matched the cost of two-way transportation on the T,” Finance Committee member Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said. “If the T rates are going up, it’s only fair that we raise our funding limit to reflect that.”
The new UC subsidy maximum will remain consistent with the price of a round-trip T ticket with a CharlieCard.
The Finance Committee considered raising the funding cap to $5.50 per person during their policy meeting Sunday, to match the cost of a round-trip T ride with a CharlieTicket. However, after some debate, the committee decided to revert to funding transportation at the CharlieCard ticket price, as it has done previously.
“We want to make everyone aware that CharlieCards are free,” Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said, emphasizing the importance of effective communication between the committee and the student body.
According to Finance Committee policy, the UC will only fund travel within the greater Boston area at the MBTA rate of $4.50 a student, regardless of the modes of transportation student groups choose to use.
For student organizations traveling outside of the greater Boston area, the Finance Committee may still provide transportation funding, but only at the same rate that groups traveling within Boston receive. The committee established this precedent when the Pre-Veterinary Society requested transportation funding in February.
The UC is not the only resource available for student organizations to receive travel funding. The Office of Student Life also manages the Dean of Harvard College’s Student Life Fund, a grant that allocates $50,000 this academic year to students and recognized student groups for domestic travel.

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are warming to the prospect of a secondary field in education studies, according to Katherine K. Merseth, a senior lecturer on Education at the Graduate School of Education.
An education secondary, which Merseth has worked to implement for more than a year, did not see initial success in gaining traction. But, Merseth said, FAS members are now renewing their interest in the field. 
“In part, the reaction we got back from FAS was that it’s an FAS program; we need people in FAS to lead it,” Merseth said. “I understand their concern, and it’s sort of lain dormant for about a year, but now we’re back on track with support from FAS faculty, which was what was essential that we show.”
James T. Kloppenberg, a History professor and chair of the committee administering the Social Studies concentration, said he supports the secondary field. Kloppenberg said there is a strong desire among students and faculty members for a well-defined interdisciplinary field in the study of education.
“The questions of how people learn and how schools are organized are important to scholars in psychology, sociology, government, economics, literature, and history,” Kloppenberg wrote in an email. “Giving students a chance to augment their concentrations with a cluster of courses devoted the study of education makes perfect sense to me.”
Both Kloppenberg and Merseth noted that some criticize the proposed field for potentially being pre-professional and contrary to the ideals of a liberal arts education. But both dismissed that idea as a common misconception.
“I know there are people who misunderstand ‘education’ to mean ‘teacher training’ and think that at, as such, it has no place in a liberal arts college,” Kloppenberg wrote. “I think that’s an error.”
Claudia Goldin, an economics professor who supports the proposed secondary in education, said the field would be a study of education as an institution, not a training program for would-be teachers.
“In my own department, there’s an enormous latent demand for a field that we would call ‘education,’ even though it is not a field about instruction or pedagogy or heuristics,” Goldin said. “It’s about the field of learning, the field of the diffusion and creation of knowledge.”
Merseth’s popular Gen Ed course United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education”—for which almost 500 students lotteried this semester—helps students study education’s place in society, Merseth said. The proposed secondary could do something similar, she added.
“Students often are so narrowly tracked to get here that they really haven’t stopped to think about education as a broader subject that can be studied,” Merseth said. “What I want you to become aware of is that education, like government, like health, are things that are public goods, that are available to everyone, and permeate society.”
According to Kloppenberg, the next step for the creation of the secondary would be a recommendation from the Undergraduate Educational Policy Committee, followed by a Faculty vote.
Jennifer L. Hochschild, a professor of government and of African and African American Studies supportive of the secondary field, said she was hopeful that the proposal would move forward.
“We’re an educational institution,” Hochschild said. “The study of education seems to belong in a university and seems to belong in students’ ability to understand themselves—what they have been through, what they are now doing, their place in the world.”

Harvard and other universities are working to improve counseling services at a time of increasing rates of mental health concerns nationwide.
An annual survey conducted by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors indicates that rates of mental illness are rising, with anxiety surpassing depression as the most prevalent mental illness among students. In 2015, 47.4 percent of students who reporting seeking counseling services said anxiety was a primary mental health concern, while 40.2 percent reported depression as a concern.
This trend is apparent on campus as well, with mental health making the headlines through advocacy from student leaders and organizations, in addition to student-run events on campus.
According to the survey, students have increasingly used counseling services over the past few years, but universities across the country, including Harvard, are still encouraging students to seek help.
“Counseling centers are constantly going around trying to tell people, it is safe, we are confidential, we will protect your information, come on in, feel brave to be here,” Brian J. Krylowicz, counseling director at Springfield College, said. “It is incredibly challenging for any student to get the nerves to pick up the phone and make a phone call, or text, or walk into the site and say ‘I need to make an appointment.’”
“There are several myths surrounding mental health such as you are ‘weak’ or if you are depressed that you can just ‘snap out of it’,” Amy M. Lenhart, president of the American College Counseling Association, wrote in an email. “I think as a society we need to do a better job of educating people that seeking treatment for mental health is just as important as seeking treatment for physical health.”
A lack of diversity in mental health services has also surfaced as a factor that may prevent students from seeking counseling. In response, Harvard University Health Services supervised the creation of Indigo, a new peer counseling group created to specifically address issues of race and class.
David R. Reetz, a member of the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors governing board, said he believes a counselor’s race and ethnic awareness is more important than his or her race itself.
“Race and culture always matters, it’s always a factor, it’s just that unfortunately, it’s more easily overlooked by those in the majority race,” Reetz said. “There is something powerfully healing about being understood from someone different from us.”
Beyond issues of access and usage of counseling services, mental health professionals attribute several factors to the increase in rates of anxiety, such as a greater awareness of threats like terrorism in the world and a decrease in personal interactions with people because of technology.
“We spend more time connected with our peers electronically, and less time connected with our peers physically,” Reetz said. “There’s some theories that suggest it’s the physical proximity to our friends and our social support that has sort of a calming effect on us.”
Krylowicz said social media usage can also propagate an increase in anxiety by normalizing unrealistic expectations.
“People on social media, they overwhelmingly put on positive aspects of their lives,” he said. “I think this adds to the competition, there is more of a regret when someone sees someone doing well.”
Krylowicz and Reetz both cited a shift in parenting as another potential cause for the increase in anxiety among college students. Krylowicz said with decreasing birth rates, parents are more present in their children’s lives.
“The helicopter parent concept, there’s a bad connotation,” Krylowicz said. “But you look at parents and I think they’re more caring, more involved, more active in their students lives.”
Reetz explained that children do not have as much unsupervised time as the previous generation and therefore have fewer opportunities to learn to resolve threats and fears without adult supervision.
“In that sense, the tools to manage those personal relationships, to manage those more difficult emotions aren’t as prevalent at an earlier age,” Reetz said. “So then when they come to college, for many it’s the first time they’re on their own.”
He said he also thinks Harvard students should reevaluate their approach to success once they arrive on campus.
“Success and failure are not opposite ends of continuum, but that success and failure really work in tandem toward our valued goals,” Reetz said. “Then we approach failure, we don’t pull back from it, we don’t run from it, we don’t avoid it, we don’t retreat, we don’t say things like “Wow, everyone else is succeeding, I’m failing, so this isn’t the place for me.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An ordinance banning the distribution of single-use plastic bags at store checkouts in Cambridge will take effect Thursday, and some local shopkeepers are skeptical of its projected impact.
The "Bring Your Own Bag Ordinance,"which the Cambridge City Council passed a year ago, requires that all checkout bags distributed at retail stores be reusable or made of recyclable paper or compostable plastic. Retailers are also required to charge a fee of no less than 10 cents for providing environmentally friendly bags and may keep the fee to offset costs associated with transitioning away from plastic. Stores that violate the ordinance can be punished with a fine of up to $300 per day.
Some local retailers around Harvard Square are ready to begin following the new ordinance immediately, with updated registers that allow them to charge for providing environmentally friendly and cloth shopping bags.
In the text of the ordinance, the City Council wrote that reducing the number of plastic bags littered across the city will contribute to environmental goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, keeping the waterways clean, and protecting the marine environment.
“The goal is obviously to reduce plastic waste,” said Cambridge City Councillor Jan Devereux. “It’s something we could easily learn to live without. We did for hundreds of years as a society.”
Student environmentalists praised the law for the effects it will have on reducing plastic pollution.
“Getting rid of plastic as much as possible is really important for the ocean,” Whitney Hansen ’17, the president of the Harvard College Conservation Society, said.
Despite the local support, retailers in the Square expressed doubt over the impact of the new law and ambivalence over the City’s ability to enforce the fines.
Al May, a clerk at the local candy and apparel shop Hidden Sweets, said the majority of his customers are tourists who are unlikely to have a reusable bag with them.
“Sixty-five percent of our sales come from people who are traveling to other parts of the country,” May said. “I just can’t imagine that they are going to be carrying their bags with them to offset the 10 cent charge.”
May also predicted a rocky transition.
“There’s going to be some growing issues. If they want to lay down $300 tickets, good luck,” May added, referring to the law’s fine.
The success of the ordinance in reducing plastic bag use will likely vary depending on the nature of the retailer. In stores like Staples, most of whose customers live nearby, store clerk Bill Noble said he did not think the ordinance would have a significant impact.
“Seventy-five percent of customers don't want a plastic bag anyway,” Noble said.
Devereux, however, said she believes the transition to reusable bags will not be as onerous as some think.
“Once people have an inventory of four or five reusable bags and get in the habit of it, it’s really not going to be a big deal,” Devereux said. “A year or two from now, we’re all going to scratch our heads and think, ‘Why was there any resistance to this?’”
Aware of the burden that the ordinance could impose on low-income residents, the City of Cambridge is also collecting about 10,000 reusable bags to redistribute to those most in need.
“If you have to pay 10 cents for each bag, that could come up to 50 cents or even a dollar every time you go to the grocery store,” said Michael D. Orr, the waste reduction program manager at the Cambridge Department of Public Works.

As voters line up at caucuses and primaries across the nation during the contentious 2016 presidential election, some Harvard students cast their votes with stamps and an envelope, sending absentee ballots to their home states.
With the majority of undergraduates hailing from outside of Massachusetts, numerous Harvard students, many of whom are voting for the first time, must request absentee ballots if they want to vote as residents of their home states.
The Institute of Politics has taken an active role in mobilizing and widening the base of college students who vote. The IOP’s college-wide HVOTE initiative assists students in their registration, utilizing the online program TurboVote to streamline the process .
“Within the past two years we have done a lot of grassroots work to have students go out, using the TurboVote software, [to] conduct voter registration drives [and] host events, to get people to come and register,” said Austin E. Sowa ’17, the vice president of the IOP and former student director of the HVOTE campaign.
Sowa emphasized the goal of making registration as easy as possible for busy Harvard students.
“It’s very easy to make excuses to not go out and vote,” said Sowa. “We want to help make sure students don’t have to face those barriers, that the time you spend requesting and getting absentee ballots is minimal, so your efforts can go into learning more about the issues you care about.”
Students who participated in the IOP’s HVOTE campaign reported being satisfied by the ease with which they could register.
“I signed up through TurboVote at the IOP’s open house last semester,” said Malaaz H. Ghandour ’19, a Texas resident who voted in both Houston’s municipal elections in November and the state’s Democratic primary on March 1. “This was my first time voting for anything, so I was excited, especially for the primaries.”
Other students navigated the absentee process without help from the IOP. Andrew B. Pardue ’16, a former Crimson editorial writer, says he requested his ballot two weeks before the March 15 primary in his home state of North Carolina.
“It wasn’t too difficult,” he said. “I didn’t really experience any bumps or bruises on the road filling out the ballot, but I know of a lot of students who did have difficulty getting their ballots in on time.”
One of those students was Pardue’s girlfriend, Emilia T. San Miguel ’16.
“I requested my ballot a week before, which was the deadline,” San Miguel said. “Long story short, I didn’t get my ballot before Election Day.”
Last fall, more than 50 percent of Harvard undergraduates were registered to vote, Sowa said, adding that HVOTE aims for a registration rate of above 75 percent. He said he hoped that more students would be inclined to register in the general election.
“It’s good to see so much momentum being built from the students, and I hope that eventually we will be able to get students to participate across the board,” Sowa said.

Seniors scrambling for jobs as their time at the College draws to an end are looking toward the Office of Career Services for help.
“It is very stressful as you get close to graduation if all your blockmates and everybody know what they’re doing,” OCS Director Robin E. Mount said. “Students should feel free to come in and let us help you.”
With graduation less than two months away, many members of the Class of 2016 are still in the process of determining their plans once they leave campus. OCS continues to hold events and post new jobs for those still searching.
Resources like the Crimson Careers database are updated with new job postings on a daily basis, according to Anthony J. Arcieri, the OCS director of undergraduate career advising and programming.
“There were 14 full-time jobs that were just posted today alone in our database,” he said.
Students have a better chance using the the Crimson Careers database because it is unique in that employers are actually looking for Harvard students as opposed to other “web crawlers,” Deborah A. Carroll, associate director of OCS employment relations and operations, said.
One important factor that affects students’ job search is that the various fields seniors are applying to often run on different cycles, influencing when students are able to apply for positions.
Connie Yan ’16 said she hopes to find a job in the entertainment industry, which typically has later deadlines than more popular career paths at Harvard like consulting or finance. She said she is most focused on finding a job she likes.
“I’m less concerned about finding something and more concerned about finding something I’m going to enjoy,” Yan said.
However, she said finding a job in the entertainment industry presents its own challenges and requires a strong sense of initiative.
“I think the entertainment industry is definitely it’s own beast because it’s just so fast and it doesn’t wait for anyone,” she said. “It’s all about timing and luck.”
Last year, just 17 percent of the Class of 2015 went straight to graduate or professional school, with the vast majority of the rest joining the workforce, according to data presented by OCS.
Mount said her office wants students to see their first job after college as a “next step” and not a career they have to stick with for the rest of their life.

Peter Maurer, President of International Committee of the Red Cross, emphasized the importance of concerted international attention to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria at the Institute of Politics Wednesday.
The tumultuous war in Syria has led to internal displacement of 10 million Syrians and has resulted in four and a half million refugees, according to Panelist Michael G. Ignatieff, a professor of the practice at the Harvard Kennedy School. Amid the crisis, organizations including the Red Cross have been actively working to provide humanitarian support.
“We are relatively good in delivering water and sanitation services in Syria. It’s covering large part of the territories,” Maurer said at a panel in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
While Maurer said the Red Cross is making progress in that field, he underlined the “complete struggle” to provide medical services to Syrians.
Still, Maurer highlighted the struggles of promoting humanitarian efforts in Syria and the struggle to balance negotiations with both the Syrian government and the rebels.
“Both sides were watching scrupulously. When one package is unloaded from the truck that in the other part there would also be another package unloaded,” Maurer said. “It’s constant on-spot, real-time negotiation.”
Ignatieff called the Syrian refugee a “humanitarian and strategic catastrophe” and said the war in Syria was a “geostrategic issue”.
He argued that the United States should admit more Syrian refugees, having allowed about 3,000 in its borders since the beginning of the crisis in 2011. Last September, Ignatieff penned an op-ed in The New York Times urging countries outside of Europe to take on more Syrian refugees.
At the panel, Ignatieff also pointed to the need for more resources for organizations operating in the war-torn country.
“Large international organizations like Red Cross, UNHCR and World Food Program have done their best, but they are underfunded,” he said, using an acronym for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the U.N.’s refugee agency.
Jacqueline Bhabha, a professor of the practice at the Harvard School of Public Health who moderated the panel, said the event, featuring “deep thinkers” like Maurer and Ignatieff, should allow people to think critically about the humanitarian cause of addressing the Syrian refugees crisis. Bhabha is also the chair of the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Attendee Margaret M. Irving ’17 said she enjoyed the panel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 1, 2016, at 2:44 p.m.
The Harvard Graduate School of Design kicked off a three-day event on Wednesday night with keynote speeches that focused on racial justice in St. Louis.
The conference, titled “Voices & Visions of St. Louis: Past, Present, Future,” is a “multi-year transdisciplinary conversation on questions of injustice, inequality, and racial exclusion in urban America,” according to the event program.
The event comes more than a year after outcry in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black male, and subsequent non-indictment of Darren D. Wilson, the police officer responsible.
In his opening remarks, GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi called the conference a continuation of a series of events addressing design, space, and social justice at the school.
“This has been an incredibly important experience for the GSD community intellectually, emotionally, but really also in terms of the way in which the conversation has really affected our work in the school, our pedagogy,” Mostafavi said.
Mostafavi specifically cited the work of GSD instructor Daniel T. D’oca, who led a studio course last fall that focused on race in America and mapped the locations of streets named after Martin Luther King, Jr.
“It seemed like a lot of stars had aligned and a lot of people institutionally as well as citizens and the American public [were] interested in these types of questions,” said, Diane Davis, a GSD professor and chair of the school’s Department of Urban Planning and Design.
The event consisted of keynote speeches from associate professor of urban studies at The New School Joseph Heathcott, and Missouri State Senator Jamilah Nasheed.
In his keynote speech, Heathcott detailed the historical antecedents of racial tension and segregation in St. Louis.
“Really amid the worst things of segregation in St. Louis, I would argue, black men and women honed the very tools needed to dismantle apartheid and so for us have left a legacy and a model to follow in terms of challenging racial injustice in America,” Heathcott said.
Nasheed focused on her experience in St. Louis, where she grew up. Nasheed said the city’s law enforcement, education system, and infrastructure have all failed its most disadvantaged residents.
To illustrate her point, Nasheed spoke about her loss of parents and previous arrests, which she said she overcame to eventually become a state senator.
“The senator’s speech had a reminder that we are not just studying, that we have to do actions and move forward to ensure that we are improving communities and people’s lives: that is what it is all about,” said Don Rowe, Director of Urban Planning and Design Agency in St. Louis.
The event ended with a keynote panel of Heathcott, Nasheed, Davis, and Senior Loeb Scholar David Harvey who fielded questions from a filled auditorium.
GSD, Divided City Initiative, and Washington University’s Center for the Humanities and the College of Architecture and Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Design worked together to host the conference.
The conference continues tomorrow with four separate panels and will conclude on Friday with a student-led initiative to showcase on-going work on race, space, and design. Students are also planning a hackathon Saturday to work on projects that grow out of Friday’s event, according to Davis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seniors who submitted their theses said they are looking forward to spending their newfound free time away from libraries and looming deadlines.
Although they said they were somewhat stressed during the writing process, several students reflected on thesis experiences with a sense of fulfillment.
Most seniors began planning their thesis during their junior year and began the writing process in their senior fall. Carlino Mark M. Natividad ’16, a joint concentrator in Government and East Asian Studies who wrote his thesis on differences in defense policy opinions between Japanese male and female political candidates, said his workload escalated as soon as he returned to campus for his senior year.
“I came back to campus in late August and started working on it for approximately three to five hours a week,” he said, “but then everything ramped up after winter break to be about five to 10 hours per week.”
Dianisbeth M. Acquie ’16, an English concentrator who wrote a collection of short stories for her thesis, had a similar work process. Still, turning in the thesis itself proved to be rewarding for both.
“I felt really proud of myself, and really happy that I had the opportunity to write a creative thesis. It was something that I was proud of having accomplished,” Acquie said.
Chloe Y. Li ’16, a Neurobiology concentrator, agreed. “It really felt like a capstone to my academic career here in college,” she said.
For Cindy Niu ’16, a Social Studies concentrator,  her thesis experience was a formative one.
“Towards the end, I definitely think I grew a lot in terms of experience, sureness in myself, confidence in my ideas,” she said.
Now that the process is over, seniors are looking forward to spending their time in different ways.
Natividad, a member of the Senior Class Committee, is now busy working on planning activities for the Class of 2016, ranging from a cooking workshop to the upcoming Senior Champagne Brunch. In addition, Natividad said he plans on devoting more of his time to classes and extracurriculars.
Niu said she plans to spend the rest of her Harvard undergraduate career spending time with friends and looking ahead to what is next.
“I’d like to spend time with people I care about, and make lasting memories in the time that I have left,” she said. “I want to do a lot of self-reflecting about what it is that I want, and what I will find the most fulfilling.”
Acquie said she hopes to reflect on her past undergraduate experience.
“I’m spending a lot of time with my friends to remember the memories that we had in freshman year and in sophomore year,” she said. “It’s a lot of walking along memory lane these days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2016, at 4:00 p.m.
Two days after ex-Harvard men’s hockey captain Jimmy Vesey opted not to sign immediately with the Nashville Predators, Vesey’s representatives broke their silence in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon.
“After being fully advised of his options and upon the recommendation of his advisors and counselors, Jimmy Vesey shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent on August 15, 2016,” began the statement, which proceeded to challenge the account of events provided by the Nashville Predators’ front office.
In an interview Tuesday afternoon on SportsNet’s Hockey Central program, Nashville Assistant General Manager Paul Fenton said that Vesey told him prior to the Feb. 29 NHL trade deadline that he would be signing with the Predators. Fenton said he received Vesey’s word outside the Harvard locker room following the Beanpot consolation game at TD Garden on Feb. 8 after having asked the forward three times if he would be signing with the club.
“I said I realized he was in a tough position here, that I was asking him this, but we needed to know from a lineup standpoint and our trade deadline plans as to what he was going to do,” Fenton said.
Peter Fish and Peter Donatelli of Global Hockey Consultants, Vesey’s agency, pushed back on this claim in their statement Wednesday afternoon.
“Nashville now claims and it has been widely reported that they were without knowledge of this possibility and that this lack of knowledge precluded the hockey club from acquiring a player at the Trade Deadline,” the statement reads. “This contention is not accurate. The Nashville Predators were informed prior to the Trade Deadline that they should conduct their business as they saw fit and that the potential of signing or not signing Jimmy Vesey should not be a factor in their decision.”
For the second consecutive year, Vesey had the option to sign and play with the Predators after the Crimson’s season came to an end in the NCAA tournament. Nashville drafted Vesey in the third round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, 66th overall.
A year ago, however, Vesey—the 12th leading point-getter in Harvard history—elected to return to school for his senior season, and at least for now, he has declined the opportunity to join the team that drafted him once again.
Vesey’s decision came as a surprise not only to Fenton, but to Nashville General Manager David Poile, who said Monday that he had not been told Vesey was considering testing free agency until last week when the organization received a call from Vesey’s camp.
“Up until a week ago Wednesday, I thought for sure we were going to sign Jimmy Vesey,” Poile said. “So this is a shocker.”
Per the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement, Nashville maintains “the exclusive rights of negotiation” for Vesey’s services through Aug. 15.
Poile has said that he will continue trying to “persuade him to change his mind” in hopes of still getting a deal done, but if Vesey remains unsigned after Aug. 15, the 6’3” winger can then begin negotiating with the other 29 teams in the league.
Previous reports have mentioned the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs among the teams aiming to acquire Vesey’s services.
One report early Wednesday morning from the Boston Herald linked Vesey, a Charlestown native, to his hometown Bruins, per “an extremely well-placed source within the Boston-area college hockey community.”
Meanwhile, Vesey has family ties within the Maple Leafs organization, as his father, Jim, is a team scout, and his younger brother, Nolan, was drafted by the team in 2014.
Nonetheless, Vesey’s final landing spot may remain unknown for quite a while. In the meantime, however, by opting not to leave for Nashville right away, Vesey will be able to graduate from Harvard in May.
“Jimmy and his family are very proud and pleased that this will indeed happen,” his statement reads. “The Harvard community and alumni have rallied around him. Jimmy is very appreciative of this support and the fact that he will now be able to graduate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to secure consecutive wins for the first time in almost a month, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team found itself trailing against No. 9/10 Albany, 10-7, with less than four minutes to go. Senior midfielder Sean McDonagh pulled one back for the Crimson and his classmate, attackman Will Walker, added another to close the gap to 10-9 with 1:51 remaining.
Senior long-stick midfielder Matt Ryan regained possession for the Crimson with a ground ball pickup, giving Harvard a last chance in front of goal to tie the game. With one second remaining, Walker released a shot from the crease, but Albany senior goalkeeper Blaze Riorden recorded his 18th save of the contest to give the Great Danes the 10-9 home victory.
Harvard (5-5, 1-1 Ivy) falls back to .500 with four games to go this season, all in conference. The Wednesday night matchup against Albany marks its final midweek tilt. Albany (6-2, 2-0 America East), meanwhile, was able to extend Its winning streak to three with the victory over the Crimson.
The Great Danes’ successful gameplan began with containing Harvard attackman Devin Dwyer, who was recently named the Ivy League Player of the Week. The senior entered Wednesday’s game ranked second in the NCAA in points per game with 5.33, but the Albany defense keyed in on him throughout the game, limiting him to two assists and no goals. It was the first time all season that Dwyer did not find the back of the net.
“If a team spends all their energy trying to stop one guy, everyone else has to step up,” said midfielder and co-captain Sean Mahon. “Not enough of us did that tonight.”
The first quarter started out with the Great Danes taking an early 3-1 lead. After Albany appeared to continue its momentum with an early second quarter goal, the Crimson fought back with sophomore goalie Robert Shaw making three consecutive saves and sophomore midfielder Sean Coleman and sophomore attackman Joe Lang tallying flashy goals.
Coleman scored on a bounce shot from 12 yards out following a skillful dodge to his left, and Lang made two quick runs at the crease before successfully getting in front of his defender and in a position to get the ball past Riorden to close the deficit to one.
With only two seconds remaining in the first half, however, Albany sophomore attackman Justin Reh scored his second goal of the game to give the Great Danes a 5-3 advantage and a boost of momentum heading into intermission.
“Their offense, for a few years now, has been one that’s hard to keep up with,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ‘96 said. “They have several guys who can make plays at any spot on the field at any time.”
For the first seven minutes of the second half, solid defense and impressive goalkeeping on both ends prevented either team from scoring. At the 7:37 mark, after three wide shots, Albany took advantage of its man-up situation and found the back of the net.
After the Great Danes’ goal, Albany continued to control the flow of the game by winning five of six faceoffs in the quarter, pushing its lead to 8-5 going into the fourth.
“We didn’t have a great game at the X, but [Sullivan] showed some improvement, especially at the end,” Wojcik said. “It’s an area we’ll continue to work on.”
The final quarter started out much like the third, with five minutes of back and forth play and no scores. Lang scored his second goal of the game, setting the tone for the Crimson’s final push.
Harvard’s offense dominated the final ten minutes, outscoring Albany 4-2 and picking up six ground balls, but the game ended before the Crimson could tie the score.
“We played hard the whole game,” Mahon said. “But, they're a good team, and if we make mistakes they're going to take advantage of them and if we don't take advantage of theirs, we’re going to be in a tough spot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team registered ten hits on Wednesday evening, but it proved not to be enough to bail out its pitching staff as the Crimson fell, 11-4, to Holy Cross in Worcester. The Crusaders (9-16) had five innings in which they posted two or more runs as the Harvard (7-10) hurlers struggled to find the strike zone. The game was the team’s final nonconference contest before Ivy League play, which begins this weekend.
“We didn’t get the result we wanted, but it was good to get out there one more time before Ivies, get one more game under our belt,” co-captain Matt Sanders said. “It was good toward the end, we got some guys who have had limited at-bats earlier in the season, they got in there and get some ABs. We had some guys throw who haven’t had as many innings this year so I think it’s going to be good experience.”
Freshman Simon Rosenblum-Larson got the ball for the Crimson and ran into trouble in his first and last innings of work. Holy Cross tagged the first-year for four earned runs in just three innings of work. Junior first baseman Anthony Critelli, who drove in four runs on the evening, tripled in the first while junior left fielder Bill Schlich homered two innings later for one of his three hits.
Sophomore utilityman Matt Rothenberg continued to be a bright spot for Harvard on Wednesday. The Boca Raton, Fla. native, a third baseman in high school who was the Crimson’s designated hitter against Holy Cross, is hitting .375 this season after going three-for-four with two runs scored on Wednesday.
“Momentum-wise, we definitely want to keep swinging the bats the way we’re doing,” Sanders said. “I think we’re hitting the ball very well and we’ve gotten production from pretty much everyone in our lineup top to bottom. We still need to put a little more emphasis on our bullpen. We’re getting off to some pretty good starts but we need to work on coming in there out of the bullpen and really shutting teams down.”
However, Rothenberg and company were unable to keep pace with the Holy Cross offense. Juniors Josh Ellis and Drew Reid each had two hits, but Harvard left 14 runners on base. While the Crusaders stranded eight baserunners of their own, the hosts were able to capitalize on clutch hitting and miscues from Crimson pitching.
“It’s a positive and a negative,” co-captain DJ Link said. “The bottom line is you need to get on base to score and you need to hit, but sometimes if a team has a lot of hits and not a lot of runs, it means you’re not necessarily getting the hits at the right times so it’s something as a team you need to work on and continue to do well. We’re getting hits and we’re getting on base, we just have to focus on manufacturing the runs.”
Sophomore hurlers Noah Zavolas and Dylan Combs combined to surrender four earned runs despite recording just three outs. Zavolas hit one batter while his classmate plunked three as both pitchers threw less than half of their pitches for strikes. Although seniors Shaun Rubin and Sean O’Neill temporarily closed the floodgates in the sixth and seventh, respectively, the deficit proved too great to overcome.
Senior Joey Sliepka struck out the side in the eighth despite walking two batters. Harvard posted single runs in the sixth and eighth with Reid driving in the first and freshman Ben Skinner drawing a bases loaded walk.
“The biggest key from a pitching and defense standpoint is to make them earn their way on base,” Link said. “Walking guys and hitting guys, it does two things: it gives free passes to the other team and it takes your defense out of the game because they’re not on their toes.”

“In the wake of the present Mumps epidemic, a disease prevalent among children, of 21 cases, 17 Yardlings have been confined to bed, it was learned from Dr. Arlie V. Bock Henry K. Oliver Professor of Hygiene, yesterday.”
At first glance, you too may have assumed that this was just another update from Paul J. Barreira, MD, Director of Harvard University Health Services. Then, you probably noticed the term “Yardling,” wondered why we don’t still use it, realized there were no tips for practicing good hygiene, and then noticed that Dr. Arlie V. Bock was mentioned, instead of our boy Paul J. Barreira, MD.
Apparently Harvard University Health Services is no stranger to mumps epidemics. In fact this 1937 Crimson article, titled “University’s Private Mump Epidemic Reported On Wane,” (which could easily be mistaken for another one of Paul J. Barreira, MD’s email subject lines), almost mirrors the mumps catastrophe that has unfolded on Harvard’s campus this past month.
We’ve uncovered the similarities and differences between the 1937 mumps epidemic that hit Harvard and the 2016 outbreak of mumps on Harvard’s campus right now, based on reports from Crimson articles past and present and Paul J. Barreira, MD’s infamous email chains about the current outbreak. How much has HUHS really learned on how to deal with mumps in the last 79 years? We’ll leave you to be the judge...
THE SIMILARITIES
1937“In addition, anyone who has previously had Mumps is almost immune from a reoccurrence of the disease.”2016 (2/29/16 Email from HUHS@harvard.edu)“Individuals who have previously had mumps are considered immune to the virus.”
It’s reassuring how much knowledge we’ve acquired about mumps over the last 79 years.
1937“In a separate building at Stillman Infirmary, 19 of the swollen-checked students are isolated from the rest of the patients, filling the entire top floor, and several beds on the next story, while two men have been removed to their homes. According to Professor Bock, none of the cases has developed complications.”2016“The Cambridge Public Health Department mandates that students infected with mumps be quarantined in a single room with an individual bathroom for five days. Since most dorm rooms share a bathroom, students are housed elsewhere on campus, according to Barreira.”
At least in 1937 the University was transparent about where the swollen-cheeked students were being quarantined. 
THE DIFFERENCES
1937“Although the State as a whole reported only 174 cases of Mumps for the past week in comparison with 576 for the same period last year, University Hygiene department reported only six cases of Mumps during the entire school year of 1936-37 while the present epidemic has included 21 students.”2016“There have been 30 total cases of mumps in Massachusetts since January 1, according to state officials.”
Keep in mind, there was no such thing as a mumps vaccination until the late 1960s...
1937“In the wake of the present Mumps epidemic, a disease prevalent among children…”2016 (2/29/16 Email from HUHS@harvard.edu)“Mumps is a systemic viral illness characterized by swelling of one or more salivary glands. Symptoms may first present as an ear ache or jaw pain, and other non-specific symptoms including fever, muscle aches, and fatigue may also occur. The mumps virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and by direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions. Treatment is focused on relief of symptoms such as fever and pain from facial swelling.”
On second thought, thankfully our knowledge of mumps has significantly improved from “disease prevalent among children” to Paul J. Barreira’s short essay describing a “systemic viral illness...transmitted by respiratory droplets and by direct contact with nasopharyngeal secretions...” Whatever that means.
