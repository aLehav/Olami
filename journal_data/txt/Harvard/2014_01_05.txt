After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over a minute left in the game, senior guard Brandyn Curry shook his mark with a stutter step, darting to the left. As three defenders turned to stop his drive, Curry stopped on a dime, lofting an alley-oop to classmate Kyle Casey, who threw down an emphatic dunk. Casey’s score put Harvard (13-1) up by 13, and Curry’s free throws 37 seconds later capped the scoring on a 69-54 win over Rice (5-8).
On the night, the two veterans combined for 30 points and led the charge on a second-half surge that broke open a close game. After Rice guard Keith Washington’s layup six and a half minutes into the second half cut the Crimson’s lead to four, Curry and Casey took the game into their own hands.
In the next five minutes, the two scored or assisted on each basket in an 11-2 Harvard run that put the visitors up by 13. The Owls would not get closer than eight points the rest of the night. Overall, Curry and Casey combined for 22 points in the second half.
“Brandyn did a great job,” junior Wesley Saunders said. “He’s always steady. Coming off an injury, he’s just now getting his footing back, so I feel that he did a great job, just balancing out the team and keeping us composed under pressure.”
 
With the win, Harvard moved to 13-1 on the season, the program’s best start since the 1945-46 season. The Crimson has not lost since a Nov. 24 road loss to the Colorado Buffaloes, winning nine in a row—each by a margin of six points or more.
“We definitely saw ourselves in this position, and it's great to be in it,” Curry said. “The scariest thing is that we still feel like we haven’t played our best games yet, and we still have a lot of work to do. It’s great the work we’ve done so far, but there’s still a long season ahead.”
 
While the two seniors finished the game, Harvard was only able to stick around because of the first half efforts of Saunders and fellow junior Jonah Travis. The two combined for 22 first-half points and made nine of the Crimson’s 12 first-half field goals. Overall, the duo made nearly 80 percent of their shots in the first half, while the rest of the team made just 10 percent.
“[Saunders] is one of the better all-around players in the country,” Amaker said. “He’s really a dynamic in every phase of the game.… He can rebound, he can score it, he can shoot. He’s a rebounder and our best perimeter defender.”
The Crimson won despite a scoreless night from sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, who missed all nine of his shots from the field, including three from behind the arc. Although it was his first scoreless game in a Harvard uniform, the sophomore led the team with six assists and added three offensive rebounds.
Harvard jumped out to a 13-5 lead early, with Saunders and Casey contributing four points apiece. But after extending the lead to double digits at 19-9, the Crimson was not able to get the lead back to 10 for the rest of the half.
The Owls shot 46 percent in the first half and capitalized on poor transition defense by Harvard—an aspect of the game Curry noted the team has to improve on in the second half of the season.
“We feel like we’ve given up a lot of points and easy buckets in transition,” Curry said. “Tonight we felt like every time we had the chance to extend the lead a little bit, Rice would hit a dagger shot in transition.”
The defensive pressure of the Crimson wore on the Owls as the game went on. Rice shot just 35 percent in the second half and made just two of nine three-point attempts after shooting 40 percent from beyond the arc in the first half. Washington was the only Rice player to score in double digits and its only starter to shoot better than fifty percent on the night.
“Our pressure throughout the full 40 minutes, it can wear on you,” Amaker said. “It’s not so much that we did something differently [in the second half], but when you’re constantly facing that kind of energy and activity by our defense … it causes you to miss some shots that maybe you would have made earlier in that game. It’s a 40 minute game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first dual meet of the season, the Harvard wrestling team rebounded from a slow start to seize control and managed to ride the momentum until the very end. The Crimson (1-0) won six consecutive matches to round out its first victory of the year, 25-13, over Rider (6-3) on the Broncos’ home mats.
“I knew we needed a team effort today,” coach Jay Weiss said. “One of our guys got hurt before we left for the competition, and we knew we needed people to step up, and I think we did just that.”
Seven different wrestlers recorded victories at the meet to propel Harvard to the win.
“I thought we wrestled really well as a team,” co-captain Cameron Croy said. “There are some specific things we’ve been working on, like staying aggressive, attacking, and pushing the pace of the match, and everyone did those things today on the mat. Overall, it was a great performance.”
The commanding six match winning streak was started off by freshman Tyler Grimaldi in a regular decision over Rider’s Wayne Stinson at 157 pounds. After Grimaldi outlasted his opponent, the Crimson did not drop a contest for the rest of the meet.
Both Croy and junior heavyweight David Ng managed to notch wins in the last ten seconds of their matches, outmaneuvering their opponents with little time to spare.
“Croy got a takedown in a high scoring match and built some momentum for us,” Weiss said. “As for David, we had already won the meet going into heavyweight, but it was a tight match and he fought for the win.”
Despite a number of close matches, Harvard managed to build its lead in the latter stages of the meet.
“I saw guys getting wins in the end of periods and the ends of matches, and that’s what we train for,” Weiss said. “So that was good. Our guys really pushed through, even when they were tired.”
Freshman Eric Morris contributed one such victory to the Crimson’s tally at 184 pounds, sliding past his opponent by a score of 3-2.
“Eric got a win over someone that beat him earlier in the season,” Weiss said. “You can see as a freshman he’s definitely making progress. It was a really gritty match, and I liked what I saw from him.”
Coming off last week’s appearance at the Midlands Championships, where Harvard settled for a 29th place finish, the Crimson arrived in New Jersey prepared for the beginning of the dual meet season.
“We were kind of bouncing back from Midlands after a few days of training,” Croy said.  “The dual season is a different atmosphere. You’re not competing individually; it’s all about the team points. So as a team there was a lot of excitement.”
One of the most notable performances of the meet came from sophomore Devon Gobbo, who notched a win for the squad in the 165 position. The victory marked the beginning of a personal streak for Gobbo, as he bested Rider’s nationally ranked Ramon Santiago, 6-4, for the second straight time after beating him at Midlands by just one point.
“Santiago’s an experienced wrestler, ranked 12th in the country,” Weiss said. “Devon was wrestling even better today than he was last time he beat him, which gives [Gobbo] a lot of confidence. It shows that he can compete at that high level of wrestling.”
It was the performance of junior co-captain James Fox that sealed the victory for the Crimson, as his win at 197 pounds gave Harvard a commanding, 22-13 lead. The 10-1 margin was Fox’s third major decision of the season.
The commanding sprint to the finish marked a contrast to the Crimson’s performance at the beginning of the meet. A slow start began with a Harvard forfeit at 125 pounds, which was followed by a victory from Rider’s Chuck Zeisloft at the 133 spot over sophomore Jeffrey Ott.
Harvard answered with a pin from sophomore Todd Preston at 141 pounds, kicking off the scoring for the Crimson. Just minutes later, the Broncos responded with a victory in the 149 division to seize a seven-point lead early on. But Harvard would rack up all the remaining points in the meet.
“We just want to keep the intensity coming and build on what we’ve already started,” Croy said. “We are looking for consistency from the guys that wrestled well today and to continue to go out there and make things happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it did not come how the No. 4/5 Harvard women’s hockey team imagined, the Crimson extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games with a 3-2 win over Northeastern at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center Saturday.
Originally, Harvard was slated to face the Huskies at Fenway Park on Thursday. The team was excited for its first-ever outdoor game, a potentially memorable day it had looked forward to after a grueling first couple months of the season. The game’s last-minute cancellation due to weather was deflating, but a third-period go-ahead game-winner made the situation slightly more palatable.
Harvard (10-1-2, 7-1-1 ECAC) held a 2-1 lead for over 20 minutes before Northeastern (7-11-1, 3-5-1 Hockey East) tied the game at two late in the third. The Crimson had watched third-period leads disappear in similar fashion against Cornell and Boston College earlier in the year, but managed to avoid a third tie Saturday.
With just over two minutes left, freshman Sydney Daniels raced up the ice to get in good position before redirecting a feed from junior Samantha Reber, diverting the puck across the Husky goaltender and into the corner of the goal.
Daniels said the team did not lose confidence when the Huskies tied the game.
“We knew we were going to come back,” she said.
Northeastern did not go down easy though, posting four straight shots within 20 seconds of Daniels’ goal. The final one prompted a video review before the officials ruled sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer had kept the puck out to secure the win.
Though Harvard emerged victorious, it started slow.
Eight minutes into the first period, the Huskies found the game’s first goal, ending a two-month stretch in which the Crimson never trailed.
“It was a slow start for sure, not our prettiest game,” Harvard coach Maura Crowell said, “but we worked the rust off.”
With that goal, it appeared that the momentum the Crimson gathered in December had not survived the changing of the calendar. Harvard had not lost a game since Nov. 1, but did not play a game between Dec. 7 and Saturday. The lack of momentum was particularly clear for the team’s leading goal-scorer, sophomore Miye D’Oench, who had just one shot.
“It does feel like a restart,” Crowell said. “Getting into the flow of a 60-minute game is an adjustment after a month break.”
Still, the Crimson responded to the Huskies’ early tally as it has responded to adversity all year—somebody new stepped up.
This time it was senior Gina McDonald. Within a minute of Northeastern’s goal, McDonald won a loose puck along the offensive end boards and pushed it to junior captain Marissa Gedman, who fired a shot that deflected off a stick and into the net.
In the second period, McDonald did it by herself. On a short-handed breakaway after taking control of a loose puck in the neutral zone, McDonald threatened a forehand before deftly finding twine with a backhand.
McDonald’s second goal of the season would not be enough though, as Northeastern’s Hayley Scamurra tied the game, setting up Daniels’ game-winner.
Daniels finished the game with seven shots and is now second on the team with six goals. She has tallied five goals in the team’s last seven games and scored the game-winner against St. Lawrence as well as a big goal in the tie with Cornell earlier this season.
Initially, Harvard’s skaters were supposed to show how far they’ve come in the absence of key players the team lost to graduation, injury, and the Olympic squad in 2013 on a bigger stage. The Crimson’s three members of the Olympic team were even supposed to be in attendance at Fenway. That did not happen, but Harvard still showed how it has accrued the longest active unbeaten streak in the ECAC.
The win also extended the Crimson’s home unbeaten streak to 10 games. It has not lost at Bright-Landry Hockey Center this season. Harvard will see Northeastern again in exactly a month when the two teams play in the Women’s Beanpot at Boston College.
“We’re very resilient; we’ve faced a lot of adversity on and off the ice this year,” Crowell said. “We certainly weathered the storm tonight and got the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than four minutes into the second half, it appeared that Rice (5-8) might spoil the Crimson’s night. Guard Keith Washington sprinted around Harvard center Kyle Casey for a layup, cutting the lead to four—the closest the home team had come since early in the second half.
But the Crimson (13-1) hung on for the remainder of the half and escaped Tudor Fieldhouse with a 69-54 victory over the Owls. The win extends the winning streak to nine and gives Harvard a 13-1 record, making this the best start for the team since the 1945-46 squad, which saw its season end in the Elite Eight of the NCAA tournament.
“We’re really pleased to kind of see where we are,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s a long grind to the basketball season, but it’s nice to know that out of the box early we’re successful. It’s the number of bodies that we can play, the great balance to our team, [and] the terrific bench. I think that’s what allows us to be in the position that we’re in.”
Vital to the Crimson’s second-half success was the play of veterans Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, who scored just eight points in the first half but combined for 22 points after the break. After missing six games with a foot injury, Curry looked to have made a full recovery—the point guard’s 16 points against the Owls were a season high.
Though the Crimson is still missing key player Kenyatta Smith due to a foot injury that has sidelined him all season, Amaker credits the team’s success to a healthier roster.
“I was very pleased with us playing nine, ten bodies, get weight balanced as we have in the past,” Amaker said. “Obviously, with Brandyn being back, [it was] a tremendous effort on his part, and it’s nice to see that, it’s nice to have that.”
LIVING AT THE LINE
 
Both teams sunk 12 field goals in the first half, and by that alone, Rice should have held the edge going into halftime—the Owls hit four from downtown compared to the Crimson’s lone trey.
However, Harvard’s ability to get to the charity stripe proved the difference, giving the visitors the six-point advantage at the end of the half. Harvard had 16 free throw attempts to just three for the Owls, making 10 more shots overall from the charity stripe.
With 9:43 remaining in the first half, the Crimson reached the bonus, and a minute later, it hit the double bonus. Four Owls players—including top scorers Sean Obi and Seth Gearhart—had at least two fouls under their belt before halftime.
“That’s a big part of our attack in our arsenal,” Amaker said. “I think that our players have really known that about our program over the years. We can always recognize that piece of the puzzle. It’s really savvy and smart by our kids to know when we’re in the bonus, to be able to try and draw the foul.”
OBI QUIET
Late in the first half, Obi pulled up for a jumper, which clanged off the rim and bounced into Casey’s hands. On the ensuing Rice possession, it was déjà vu: another Obi miss and Casey rebound.
It was that kind of night for the Rice freshman, who was one of the top scorers for the Owls, averaging 11.5 points per game coming into Saturday night. The combination of Harvard’s post players—Casey, juniors Jonah Travis and Steve Mondou-Missi, and freshman Zena Edosomwan—created a frustrating night for Obi, who saw many of his shots miss their mark.
The forward finished with just six points on two-for-seven shooting. Twice in the first half, the forward attempted to back down fellow frosh Edosomwan, but was unable to make headway and neither shot hit the rim.
“I think the bigs did a terrific job,” Curry said. “That’s a tough player to guard, Obie. He’s a big guy, a post player, we haven’t played too many of that size. I feel like they did a really, really good job, especially Jonah coming off of the bench, defending, rebounding, finishing, hats off to our bigs, they always play tough.”
The Crimson’s transition defense showed a marked improvement after halftime, forcing a weary Rice team to shoot just 35 percent in the second half. The Owls coughed up the ball 10 times in the second half, double its mistakes in the first.

When the Harvard men’s basketball team (13-1) visited the Rice Owls (5-8) on Jan. 4, a familiar face—Jeremy Lin ‘10—watched from the stands. The Crimson was able to catch up with Lin after the game and ask him a couple questions about the future of the team. Below is the interview.
 
The Harvard Crimson: What do you think about the current Harvard team, as compared to previous teams?
 
Jeremy Lin: I think this one has the potential to be the best ever. Obviously, everyone knows they were good last year, and now they have three guys back that were ineligible last year, so I think this should be their best season.
 
THC: Do you have any projections for March Madness?
 
JL: No, I don’t want to jinx anybody, but in my mind, I do.
 
THC: Are there any guys on the team you see as potential pro players?
 
JL: There’s a lot of them. If you start with the seniors, I think Kyle’s a pro, I think Brandyn’s a pro. Wes and Siyani, they have so many good players. Laurent’s going to play pro too, if he wants, he’s good enough. They’ve got a lot of good players.
 
THC: Now in your second season in Houston, you’ve been put in a supersub role for the Rockets. What’s it like coming off the bench?
 
JL: It’s been different. As a team, we’ve been really hit by a lot of injuries, so right now it’s all different day-to-day, but I think I’m more comfortable this year in Houston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team opened its season by making a statement against some of the top ranked teams in the nation. The Crimson fell just short of making a stronger one Saturday night.
After advancing to the championship game of the Asics Invitational in Santa Barbara, Calif. by finishing first in its pool Friday, Harvard fell to No. 4 Long Beach State, 3-1.
Despite failing to pull off the upset, the Crimson's finish exceeded the expectations of some of its players.
“I honestly thought we were going to come in fifth in our pool and then probably lose that match, so I probably had the lowest expectations you could possibly have,” said junior outside hitter DJ White. “It’s exciting to come out and be able to beat some of these top ranked teams.”
The Harvard offense against Long Beach State was led by White, who had 14 kills throughout the four sets. Not far behind was senior middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper, who contributed 13 kills in the loss. Freshman setter Nick Bendell led the team in assists with 42.
“I think that we have learned a lot and grown a lot just evolving an offense, working with a new freshman setter, and working in a couple of different players,” said junior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick.
The 49ers offense proved difficult to handle, as Long Beach State recorded 66 kills on the night. Offensive leaders for the 49ers were senior outside hitters Tyler Crabb, who had 19 kills, and Dalton Ammerman added 18 of his own. Senior setter Connor Olbright led the game with 55 assists.
Overall, Long Beach State attacked .381 on the night compared to .250 for the Crimson. While each team had 18 attack errors, the 49ers were able to set up far more opportunities on the offensive end.
“They were one of the quickest offenses we have seen so far,” Zimmick said. “Coming into the match we were keying in on … one of their outside attackers who is probably one of the best or second best players in the country. So we kind of focused on that, but then they started beating us in the middle. They ran a very smooth offense.”
Harvard bounced back from a 25-18 loss in the opening set of the match to win the second game, 25-20. But the Crimson could not build on the momentum and dropped the following two sets to settle for the second place title at the tournament.
During the second set, the Crimson ran off five consecutive early points and took an 11-7 lead on a kill by Rehkemper. Long Beach State retaliated to pull within two, but Harvard held its lead and steadily built upon it to even the match score.
“I think after seeing their serve during the first set we were able to respond to that and handle those [serves] better,” Zimmick said. “We got a few timely hits and blocks and won a couple of the longer rallies which helped us gain some momentum to win the second set.”
The 49ers never trailed in the third game, though the Crimson made it interesting by taking three of the last six points before Long Beach State won, 25-19. The fourth and final set was less of a contest, with Harvard falling by a 25-13 margin.
“They were serving really well, which messed us up in the fourth game,” White said. “I would say the first three games we played really well, but we kind of ran out of gas in the final game.”
The weekend saw Harvard defeat two nationally ranked teams and earn a second-place title in a ten-team tournament, and the Crimson players are optimistic for what the future holds.
“Overall, we’ve learned a lot this tournament from playing some of the best teams in the nation,” Zimmick said. “We played with [Long Beach State] for most of the match. It’s always challenging playing teams with such fast offenses, but I think that’s something we can definitely work on.”
“Beating ranked teams like Stanford [on Friday] and staying close with Long Beach State makes us excited for what is still in store for us this season,” White added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard and Boston University men’s hockey teams met twice, combining to score 11 goals each time. In their first tilt of the new year Saturday night, the two teams proved that this would not be a trend left behind in 2013.
In front of a packed crowd at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the Crimson (5-7-2, 2-6-2 ECAC) lit the lamp a season-high seven times, skating to a 7-4 victory over the visiting Terriers (7-9-2, 2-4-1 Hockey East).
Despite the Harvard offense dominating the stat sheet, the Crimson needed its penalty-killing unit to seal the victory.
With Harvard leading 5-4 and 4:47 left in the contest, a hit from behind by defenseman Dan Ford on BU’s Jake Moscatel resulted in a five-minute major penalty, leaving the Crimson shorthanded for the remainder of regulation.
The Terriers had converted each of their previous three power play opportunities, but Harvard held its ground in the final minutes. The Crimson prevented BU from putting a single shot on net over the course of the man advantage, blocking seven shots during that span.
“I didn’t think we folded,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I thought we really pulled together and found a way to really battle. I like the way we responded for the last five minutes there.”
And the Crimson did more than just kill the final penalty. With less than two minutes remaining, a deflection off the skate of a BU defenseman in the Harvard zone sent the puck flying towards freshman forward Sean Malone. Starting at his own blue line, the freshman carried the puck in on Terrier goaltender Sean Maguire and put home a backhander on the breakaway.
Just one minute later, Malone added another shorthanded goal, clearing the puck out of his own end and into an empty BU net, capping the 7-4 victory.
The performance by the Crimson penalty-killing unit in the closing minutes marked a sharp turnaround from the beginning of the period. Carrying a 5-2 lead into the final frame, Harvard allowed the Terriers to climb back into the game by committing penalties.
With 14:03 left to play, BU forward Danny O’Regan knocked a rebound past Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard on the power play to cut the deficit to 5-3. The Terriers capitalized once again on its next power play eight minutes later when defenseman Ahti Oksanen ripped a shot past Girard from the top of the right circle, bringing BU within one.
Harvard also had its share of opportunities on the power play, with the Terriers putting the home team on the man advantage eight times. The Crimson generated several chances but could not put the game away, failing to score on six power plays.
“We had some good looks [on the power play], but I thought we could have moved the puck around a little bit better,” Donato said. “We had a lot of mishandling of passes, and [we] just weren’t as sharp as we were earlier in the game.”
This sharpness early on aforementioned by Donato led Harvard freshman Phil Zielonka to have the best game of his career. The forward earned both of Harvard’s power play goals on the night, marking his first two collegiate scores.
“It feels great,” Zielonka said. “It was a tough start [this season] personally for me, but I knew it would come sooner or later. Coach [Donato] gave me an opportunity to play with [some] great players.”
Zielonka notched his first goal at the 12:19 mark of the first period. With the score tied at one, Harvard defenseman Patrick McNally fired a pass to forward Alexander Kerfoot at the bottom of the right circle, who sent a touch pass to Zielonka. The freshman ripped a shot past then-BU goaltender Matt O’Connor to put the Crimson on top.
He struck again in the second period, redirecting a slapshot from defenseman Victor Newell, who also scored his first collegiate goal Saturday, past O’Connor for Harvard’s fourth goal of the night, provoking a goaltending change by the visitors.
Rounding out the goal scorers for the Crimson were David Valek and Jimmy Vesey. After the Terriers had taken the lead just 47 seconds into the game on a goal from Cason Hohmann, Valek responded at 7:39 with his first score of the 2013-14 campaign. On the other end of the spectrum, Vesey earned his team-leading ninth goal of the season.
The win for Harvard marks the team’s third consecutive triumph over BU after picking up a 6-5 overtime win and a 7-4 win in the Beanpot Tournament against the Terriers last season.
“We had this game on our calendar for a long time, and everyone was really pumped for this one,” Zielonka said. “So to get the win is huge, and hopefully we can build off this.”

Dear Nicholas D. Kristof ’81,As a current editor of The Crimson I am alarmed that you have dropped your middle initial from your byline. You recently wrote that your middle initial is an unnecessary relic from your days at The Crimson and is no longer necessary for your career as an established journalist at The New York Times. As a Crimson editor it is my duty to reach out to you and correct this egregious stylistic error.So I’m here to say that you can’t get rid of your middle initial. I’m sorry, but you can’t just drop the D. It goes against everything in The Crimson’s Style Guide. Once you break one rule, what’s next? Maybe you will start writing “first-year’s dean’s office” instead of “Freshman Dean’s Office.” Worse, you might start writing “am” instead of “a.m.” If you set the precedent of no middle initial soon the Crimson Style Guide will have no authority; all 15 pages in our Google Drive will be completely meaningless and arbitrary.I understand where you are coming from. I too had a rebellious phase and tried to delete all of the Oxford commas from an article about strange bequests from alumni. Not only did I quickly learn that additional punctuation is necessary for clarity, but also that editors should not be working drunk in the newsroom. There are reasons for these rules.But it’s not just about the guide. Despite what you think, the middle initial is valuable on its own. You say that it is unnecessarily formal when journalism is becoming more casual. You even go as far as to write that its “gravitas” or seriousness creates a barrier between the author and the audience.There are a few issues with this argument. First of all, according to Crimson style, the word gravitas must always be italicized as to draw attention to how big a word it is. Secondly, journalism is casual only on Fridays, after nine p.m., when all of your festive neckties are at the dry cleaners, and even then it is still business casual.You also completely overlook the most important benefits of the middle initial. It is engaging. It is mysterious. With the decline of the attention span and the end of high school current event assignments, the mysterious middle initial is the only thing maintaining readership. Why did people read the Crimson’s expose on grade inflation or your analysis of foreign aid in Haiti? It was because they wanted to know what the full middle name of the author was, what the “D” in your byline stood for. Is it Darien? Is it Drew? No. It’s Donabet. I just Googled it.That brings me to my final point. You might be the only Nicholas Kristof out there who also happens to write for the New York Times, but some of us, especially us college writers, might not be distinguishable from our namesakes. This is why we need the middle initial. It is not so that we sound like experts in our field. It is deeper than that. It is about identity. It is so that when we Google our names regularly our work is the first thing that pop-ups and we don’t have to scroll down.Sincerely,Nicole J. LevinMagazine Editor at Large, former Executive Editor, and future Pulitzer Prize potential nominee.

Looks like Harvard is ringing in the new year with good news! In a recent ranking of university rankings we reigned supreme, with lowly Stanford and second-rate MIT coming in second and third respectively. These results were created from an aggregate of four annual major university rankings by a website about university social and academic life.An overall comparison of 2013’s rankings reveal that Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and Princeton consistently came out on top. It was a particularly good year for Harvard, with the school coming first place in a variety of lists ranging from best use of social media to being the “betchiest” of Ivy League colleges. In fact, BostInno even published a post with 11 reasons why we deserve to be number one on the ranking of university rankings. Some of the reasons include Harvard researchers creating programmable glue out of DNA, Harvard Emeritus Professor Martin Karplus winning this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and our favorite celebrity couple’s appearance at the Harvard Graduate School of Design back in November. Other reasons that unfortunately did not make this list include the fact that Harvard clinched (to no one’s surprise)  its seventh consecutive win at the Harvard-Yale game this past year and the number one ranking for best botany-related emails from the Interim Dean of the College.Unfortunately, one ranking which we did not do so successfully in is The Daily Beast’s 20 Sexiest Colleges- in fact, we failed to even make it onto the list. But don’t worry, Flyby is currently researching the flawed methodology behind that ranking.
