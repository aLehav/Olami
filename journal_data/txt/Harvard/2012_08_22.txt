After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Aug. 24, 2012, at 8:38 a.m.
Living in Budapest this past summer, I learned that Erno Rubik, inventor of the Rubik’s Cube, is Hungarian. The discovery came right after a visit to the Hungarian Parliament building, and since then I have thought a lot about the Rubik’s Cube, its absolute solution, and what it represents in the context of Hungary’s extreme political tendencies.
The Rubik’s Cube is a physical manifestation of logic, a model that Erno Rubik calls “an improvement on life.” While life is filled with imperfect puzzles, the Cube provides a challenge with one pure solution. TIME Magazine even lists the puzzle’s perfect solution as an explanation for the toy’s popularity. The Rubik’s Cube offers players “order and stability in an uncertain world,” and so it’s no surprise that the toy remained a Top 20 seller during the recession.
While the philosophy of the Rubik’s Cube is beautiful in theory (and in toy stores), the item symbolizes a frightening political idea: the idea of absolutes. Like the Rubik’s Cube, extreme political parties promise strength, durability, and clear solutions to hard problems. The trouble is that in the real world, and especially in Hungary, theoretical perfection does not equal working solutions.
Take the last 70 years of Hungarian political history. Absolute ideals have reigned supreme. In 1944, the Arrow Cross Party took power of Hungary as the Nazi’s puppet government. Months later, the Soviets “liberated” Hungary, dissolved Parliament, and installed a government that enforced four decades of communism. Hungary swung from absolute right to absolute left with little room for argument. At both ends, the Hungarian population faced deportation, imprisonment, and death.
Today, Hungary considers itself a democracy—despite the raft of decidedly non-democratic reforms called “Basic Laws” that replaced its constitution earlier this January. This new constitution increased government control over the country’s media, banks, and courts.
In the face of economic downturn, identification with extremes still permeates the political scene. The far right-wing Fidesz Party controls two-thirds of the Parliamentary vote. Led by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, the government is regulating critical radio stations, transferring funds to universities with right-wing philosophies, and fostering a counter-terrorism unit that acts more like a secret police force.
Frankly, it’s terrifying. After disposing of the Arrow Cross Party’s red flag and the Communist’s Red Army, Hungary once again finds its government abusing power under the imposing red roof of its Parliament Building. The situation, seemingly inescapable and colored in red, conjures up the same sense of finality as the finished red side of the Cube.
Comparing the Hungarian government to the Rubik’s Cube illustrates why the Cube’s extreme logic should never become a model for real-world action. The Rubik’s Cube represents the idea of finality unattached to morality—a mantra that is meaningless for a toy but dark for a government. I hope that Hungary embraces the complexity of its political puzzle instead of rushing toward an extreme solution—because if Hungarian politics continues on its current trajectory, then nascent fascism is emerging as the winner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now and then, I find a puddle on the sidewalk and stare at its reflection. The images are startling in their precision: the outlines of trees, the building facades, the cloud shapes. I feel like I’m observing a photograph, except that the images quiver in the breeze and start to look alive. I stand there mesmerized until the wind picks up speed and the picture blurs. Then I keep walking.
The puddle metaphor is the best I can conjure to describe my time thinking and writing about the Holocaust in Budapest. My grandmother survived the Nazi occupation of the city in 1944, and I traveled to Budapest this summer hoping to make sense of her memories and explore her experience through writing. Since my arrival in Hungary, my efforts to make contact with the past have cycled through clarity and confusion. I am sharpening my perception of my grandmother’s old life, but I am also finding that my most precious (and poetic) discoveries are the hazier ones: those traces of myself I see lingering in the Holocaust’s reflection.
Generational memory is a concept that applies to many post-generation survivors. The idea is that children and grandchildren of survivors are still affected by memories of the original trauma. Survivors pass on the legacy of trauma to their descendants not only through stories and recollections, but also through fears, beliefs, and behaviors very finely integrated into the survivors’ personalities. My grandmother’s severe aversion to cold and hunger, her stern warnings not to trust people, even her love of watching happy children on television shows like The Waltons, are tendencies that I think grew from the distortions of her youth.
As I wander through the sites of my grandmother’s memories, I am beginning to grasp how her identity as a Holocaust survivor has shaded my own fears, beliefs, and behaviors. As I watched the House of Terror Museum’s footage on the Nazi invasion and Russian siege of Budapest—soldiers encircling the city, slowly closing in—I was able to place my visceral fear of feeling trapped. When I visited the convent that sheltered my grandmother during the war, and when the sisters opened their doors to me with the warmth and compassion they had once shown my grandmother, I reaffirmed why empathy is my highest value.
Writing about the Holocaust, I have realized that generational memory is an important access point to the subject matter. The writing techniques I’ve adopted follow the same principle as generational memory: that, while the Holocaust itself is hard to approach, its ripple effects are tangible. As a creative writer, I am hesitant to narrate Holocaust atrocities that I did not experience—events so loaded they can easily feel compromised, capitalized, or dramatized when turned into art. I have come to realize, however, that I can make truthful observations about exploring the Holocaust’s post-generation after-haze.
Prominent Holocaust writers Paul Celan and W.G. Sebald are masters at capturing the Holocaust’s echoes. Paul Celan, a survivor himself, refers to the Holocaust in his poetry with surreal and slanted images: his mother’s hair that never grew white, vicious dice thrown around by a predatory neighbor. W.G. Sebald, the German fiction writer famous for Austerlitz, evokes the Holocaust via a series of implicit metaphors. The author tells the story of a man uncovering his pre-war childhood as a Czech Jew, but Sebald first enters Holocaust territory by describing birds staring from aviaries and classifications of moth species. His tactic allows readers to comprehend the refracted presence of Holocaust in the everyday world.
Guided by these writers, I find my own poetry filling up with images of glass and stars and water: materials onto which other things are reflected; bodies of such vast expanse they become cosmic, even supernatural; substances moving at incomprehensible speeds and threatening to upturn our physical landscape. I rely on these images to describe associations that form like shadows around everyday events: Hungarian schoolchildren lining up outside buildings, policemen clustering near busy streets, yellow trams rattling into the distance.
Of course, for every shadow there is a new reality. Budapest is a 21st century city trying to embrace the present. WiFi cafes have cropped up in the old Jewish ghetto, and the Dohány Street Synagogue welcomes travelers into its ornate, lavender interior. Nazi atrocities are confined to the exhibits of the House of Terror Museum and Holocaust Center, while the city landscape that formed the backdrop of those atrocities lends itself as the setting for happier times.
In the afternoons, I find myself walking alongside other Hungarians at the banks of the Danube. I wander up far enough to see the monument of metal shoes built into the riverside. The sculpture commemorates my grandmother’s friends and neighbors who were shot into the river during the war. I think about these victims: one man’s expression just before the gunshots, another woman’s clothes growing heavy and wet as her body sinks down below the surface. It’s an astonishingly sad thought. I keep looking at the river and trying to imagine, trying to reach back. But then, like the images in the puddle, the connections break, and water is just water, and it keeps flowing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year from now, Harvard will have a 42nd varsity team, a team that will play in a new multi-million dollar stadium, if all goes according to plan.
Last week, the Harvard athletic department announced that women’s rugby will become a varsity sport in the 2013-2014 season. Keith W. Cooper ’83, president of the Harvard rugby alumni association, said that the new status is just one step in a complete remodeling of the men’s and women’s rugby programs.
“This is a real signal moment for Harvard rugby,” Cooper said. “We have an opportunity to, for the first time, support—both financially and administratively—the sport in the way it should be supported. I think this is going to lead to a really strong and professional program that everyone can be proud of.”
The move had been discussed within the rugby team for years, according to team president Sarah E. L. MacVicar ’13, but serious discussions with the athletic department only began roughly a year ago. While MacVicar noted that there are some negative consequences to gaining varsity status—namely losing its self-run status—she said that the benefits were too great to pass up.
Once the team decided it was ready to apply for varsity status, the biggest issue was proving to the athletic department that the program had the strength in numbers necessary to sustain a competitive team long-term, according to MacVicar. In the end, MacVicar said it was a “pretty smooth process,” thanks in large part to the team’s recent success, winning the USA Rugby Collegiate Division II National Championship in 2011.
Now that it has achieved varsity status, the team will undergo a transitional year during the upcoming season to prepare for the more stringent practice rules and eligibility regulations that come with competing at the varsity level.
MacVicar said that the biggest change will be monitoring the bottom line. In the past, the club had “just been getting by financially,” according to MacVicar. While donations in the past year have helped keep the program stable, MacVicar expects the team will need a more sustainable financial structure from now on.
“It’ll be very different than it is now,” MacVicar said.
Like other varsity sports, rugby will have a combined "Friends" group—which helps to spearhead fundraising efforts—for its men’s and women’s programs, even while the men’s team does not have varsity status. This fall, the group will launch a campaign to raise $10 million. According to Cooper, roughly a third will go toward building a new field for the rugby squads.
Cooper said the group has been planning the stadium for a year, and already has a location and design in mind. The group hopes to build a new stadium behind Jordan Field—home of the field hockey team—along Soldiers Field Road. The field would be surrounded by a mound of earth to limit wind and sound, and rugby would be played on artificial turf.
“We are pretty far along,” Cooper said. “It’s going to be terrific.”
The remaining funds will be used on facility improvements, operating costs, and an endowment for full-time coaches for both the men’s and women’s teams.
“Rugby has been supported over the years by volunteers and part-time coaches who can just economically only afford so many hours,” Cooper said. “With the sport being so large as clubs, it’s really hard for [women’s rugby coach] Brian Hamlin and [men’s rugby coach] David Gonzalez to spend enough time to keep up with the Cal-Berkeleys and Dartmouths.”
Cooper said a committee including players, coaches, and alumni will be created to lead the capital campaign this fall. Even if a majority of the money comes from the over-2,000 men’s alumni, the money will be allocated for the rugby program as a whole.
“It’s going to be fifty-fifty,” Cooper said. “This is all for Harvard rugby. We are trying to endow and grow the sport at Harvard for both men and women.”
“We are all doing what we can to advance the sport,” Cooper said. “The women had the opportunity to go varsity whereas the men did not. Men had the opportunity to contribute to the facilities, the coaching staff, and we are stepping up.”
The moves made recently, and those planned for the upcoming year, may advance the sport, but Cooper said that the improvement of the program will be a long process.
Harvard isn’t the only school undergoing the process of improvement. In fact, college rugby as a whole has undergone major changes.
Currently there are only a handful of varsity programs, but “a whole cadre” of teams is considering varsity status, according to College Director of USA Rugby Rich Cortez.
“We are trying to move the whole competitive structure away from 'just kind of show up whenever you want,' to a more solid structure that allows a team to compete and aim high, but also under safe conditions with proper coaching and proper understanding about caring about the athletes,” Cortez said.
Cortez said that for a team to have success at the varsity level, they need three things: continuity of coaching, a history of success, and a critical mass of athletes.
If enough teams follow Harvard’s lead and become varsity squads, the NCAA would sponsor a national rugby championship. Cortez said he expects the sport to reach that level in due time.
“I think a lot of teams would aspire to be in [Harvard’s] shoes,” Cortez said.
This leadership opportunity played into Harvard’s decision to apply for varsity status, according to MacVicar.
“We are hoping this will set the precedent for other universities to start supporting their teams as well,” MacVicar said. “As an NCAA emerging sport, we really want to see the sport pushed forward across the country.”
