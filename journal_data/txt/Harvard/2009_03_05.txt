After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There will be no starving artists at Harvard. Just over a week after University officials announced that the endowment—the largest in higher education—fell a precipitous 22 percent in a four-month period, the University-wide Task Force on the Arts called for ambitious plans to bolster the place of arts on campus.The committee proposed the construction of major new arts facilities and sweeping changes to the undergraduate curriculum and graduate programs. Yet with a projected 30 percent decline in endowment value by the end of June, Harvard administrators are slashing budgets and curtailing University activities—including a slowdown in construction of the much-touted science complex in Allston. These cuts raise concerns about the possible implementation of the committee’s grand yet vague proposals.“When reports come out and call for very complicated and ambitious changes, there’s an extremely strong temptation to let things sink to the bottom of the ocean,” says Stephen J. Greenblatt, the English professor who chairs the Task Force.University President Drew G. Faust is not likely to succumb to that temptation, however. Lining the once bland, white walls of Massachusetts Hall, home to many of the University’s top administrators and a handful of freshmen, student work acts as a visible display of Faust’s support for the arts on campus. And in spite of the belt-tightening and penny-pinching measures, Faust has continued her commitment to the arts, most recently increasing funding for the Artist Development Fellowship. The arts, it seems, will remain a priority under her purview.CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THE ARTSDuring last month’s two-day arts showcase event, “Passion for the Arts,” Faust proposed baby steps for the University’s implementation of some of the recommendations laid out by the report—namely ones that require little or no cost.Faust pledged, for example, that faculty from across the University will soon begin discussions to establish a stronger arts practice component in both the undergraduate curriculum and graduate programs.Given the University’s financial situation, it is clear that none of the major recommendations listed in the report will be implemented anytime soon. But in the meantime, students will reap the benefits from the administration’s small gestures to keep the arts moving forward.Faust recounts that after reading the Task Force report, Sir Ronald Cohen—a member of the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body—will bring a production of one of T.S. Eliot’s works to campus before heading for New York.“The arts are often the first thing to get cut when bad economic times hit,” Office for the Arts Director Jack Megan says, adding that the University has maintained that the arts are considered “on equal footing with other priorities.”“I’m grateful for that,” Megan says. “We all are.”TO BE OR NOT TO BEIn addition to free tickets to Boston museums and a Broadway production of “Hair” later this semester, Faust plans to commit “significant” funds to expand the OFA’s Artist Development Fellowship program.It is unclear at this point how much money will be allocated for the program’s expansion this year, Megan says, adding that the office’s overall budget will see significant cuts.The fledging grant program, which has awarded nearly 30 fellowships since its inception two years ago, provides students with up to $5,000 to pursue a short-term project in the arts. Proposals are judged based on merit and the applicant’s contribution to the community.“It’s a huge decision to go out on a limb to say you want to be a writer or an actor,” says Elizabeth Bergmann, the director of the OFA dance program who also sits on the selection committee. “The ADF gives students a chance to go out there and say, ‘Hey, I could be an artist.’”Past ADF recipients have gone on to pursue a professional career in the arts, Bergmann says, citing a “real success story” of Madelyn M. Ho ’08, who signed on with the Paul Taylor Dance Company, a New York City contemporary dance group.Emily R. Kaplan ’08-’09 was awarded $3,000 last year to take a class about children’s book illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design over the summer.“I’m not done yet,” the Social Anthropology concentrator says, laughing nervously, adding that her target audience consists of six- to eight-year-olds. “It’s probably going to be published at some point,” Kaplan says slowly of the book she hopes to write. “Though I’m no where near there yet.”Though her summer experience taught her that she does not, in fact, want to be an illustrator—she fears she lacks the technical skills required of such artists—Kaplan says that she plans to continue fiction writing, focusing on children’s literature. This summer, she will be teaching at an elementary school in New Orleans.“TOO EARLY TO TELL”Daniel R. Pecci ’09, one of last year’s ADF recipients and three students who served on the Task Force, traveled through Europe last summer, stopping by Amsterdam and Avignon to attend various theater festivals.When asked if he intended to pursue acting after graduation, Pecci, an English concentrator with a secondary in Dramatic Arts, fingered the lock of hair peeking out from under his knit beanie.“I’d like to be in theater,” the actor confesses. Pecci is currently working on three different productions, including “Hamlet” at the New College Theatre and a one-man show.Pecci credits the proximity of the American Repertory Theatre to campus as a primary reason for attending Harvard. As a high school senior several years back, Pecci says that he was under the impression that Harvard was an avid proponent of the arts.“That wasn’t exactly something I found to be in the case when I first got here,” Pecci says.But after serving his stint on the Task Force, Pecci says that if the committee’s recommendations are fully implemented, “Things are going to be much better.”Though Pecci acknowledged the various steps the University has taken to keep the arts from stagnating—or worse, from diminishing—not enough time has passed to assess Harvard’s performance.“It’s too early to tell—to complain or endorse,” says Pecci.Some faculty question how some of the larger initiatives will even be implemented, considering the University’s dwindling financial resources.Bergmann, whose dance curricular programs have fortunately been spared the brunt of the widespread budget cuts, questions the feasibility of implementing the recommendations in the current economic climate.Stating that she has yet to see any progress on the major initiatives—such as creating a new concentration for the dramatic arts in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—Bergmann says that she would feel more reassured when discussions are underway.“I believe in the report—it’s a great pat on the back,” Bergmann says. “Now how do you implement it without some dollars?”STEPPING UPThough Pecci and other ADF recipients were hesitant to pass judgment on the University’s efforts to go ahead with cost-effective recommendations of the Task Force report, administrators were more willing to give Faust credit.That the University commissioned such a report, Megan says, is indicative of Harvard’s commitment to improving the place of the arts on campus.“People will be watching to see what we do,” Megan says. “And I have to say that I’m very optimistic about the direction of things.”One initiative that Faust says students will see next year is a joint venture between the OFA and the ART.With the calendar reform to be in place next academic year, the two organizations will provide students with the opportunity to sign up for a theater intensive workshop as part of the January Experience—roughly a month-long period between semesters.ART Managing Director Robert J. Orchard says that though specific guidelines for the program have yet to be set, the project would involve both graduate and undergraduate students. Orchard says the students would work closely with professionals on a particular script and later showcase the material.But Greenblatt points out that implementing the major recommendations of the report, such as creating new arts facilities in Allston or offering a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, would take a significant toll on both financial resources and time, even in better financial times.“Even if we had all the money in the world, these are things that take serious amounts of time,” Greenblatt says.For large-scale projects, Greenblatt says, it is important to keep discussion moving and not lose sight of long-term goals.“It’s very easy to lose track,” Greenblatt says. “And I’m encouraged by the fact that the University has stepped up.”

Though oral poetry peaked in the 1990s as a revival of the post-war 1960s movement made famous by artists such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, its audience has greatly diminished in a 21st century world dominated by scripted and self-conscious, rather than spontaneous, performance. At Harvard, where most art—in the theater, gallery, or on paper—presents itself as a carefully polished final product, the spirit of the spoken word tradition and its interactive nature are rarely available to students looking for a consistently available venue. One stronghold at Harvard remains however; on Thursday nights, artists at the Harvard Epworth Methodist Church unleash the Unchainable Squawk.Every week, an avant-garde, atypically bohemian crowd sporting overgrown hairdos and too-tight jeans gathers for a “session” at the Squawk Coffeehouse—an open mic remedy that banishes the stress of the long week. Unlike open mics geared to one form of artistry like music or poetry, Squawk opens up the floor to any and all types of performance. The organizers aren’t choosy, so long as performers deliver complete “phonetic liquidity.” By the end of the night the result of unrestricted performance is a blend of passion and spontaneity.Formed in 1989, Squawk is the brainchild of poet Richard Cambridge, cartoonist and poet Mick Cusimano, actress Jesse Piaia, and performer Lee Kidd. Squawk began as a way for artists and poets to enhance their artistic experiences and has essentially remained faithful to its original intent. “Some of us came from the 60s tradition and studied the Beat Generation,” said Cusimano, who along with the other founders still actively performs and manages Squawk two decades later. “We saw things they did and tried to take it one step further.” Throughout the night, people trickle in, bringing with them their art of choice: guitar, poetry, short stories, skits, rants, and more. These people come from far and wide, both geographically and socioeconomically. The Coffeehouse has attracted visitors from all over the country and abroad.No night is ever the same, as the performances vary based on whatever talent walks in the door. The unorthodox surfaces quite regularly, as jugglers, actors, and mimes grace—or shame—the stage. Even nudity makes appearances; while some performers tamely sing their covers or recite their original poetry, others are long on words and short on clothing. These wild performers have been known to shed their garb for their art, which calls for nudity... just because.Whatever the routine, no one is merely a member of the audience. Squawk hearkens back to a time when performance was more interactive. A vacuum of infectious energy, the coffeehouse sucks in its viewers, who are persuaded by their friends to take control of the mic or goaded by those on stage to speak up in response to the performances.At the end of the night, when no one has anything else to perform, Kidd bids farewell with a ritualistic closing statement. He beckons all to join him as he praises the Unchainable Squawk and all other manifestations of free and open performance. This unusual blend of artistry departs from today’s streamlined, stylized media and is a refreshingly thought-provoking take on what “performance” means—art that stresses interaction rather than mere reaction.“I go home with all these images that are boiling up inside me and they are all unique images,” Kidd says. “They were not given to me by the TV or by the paper or by all the canned images around us. They were given to us by true people.”More than anything, Squawk’s user-friendly atmosphere brings together a complete group of strangers, if only for a night.“As far as open mic nights go, I think this is probably a level or several above a lot of open mic nights I’ve been too,” says John Davey, a musician from Indiana. “Most of the people are here for a similar purpose.” That purpose? None other than unbridled and free Unchainable Squawk.—Staff writer Edward R. Coleman can be reached at efcolem@fas.harvard.edu.

Invariably vibrant and irresistibly energetic, Harvard South Asian Association’s annual performance, Ghungroo, celebrates its 20th anniversary this year. With a new program comprised of traditional dances, musical pieces, and comedic skits, this immense effort features a cast of over a hundred students. SAA co-president Ria S. Tobaccowala ’10, who shares her position with Joseph G. Thumpasery ’10, is one of the members producing Ghungroo this year. The Harvard Crimson: What are the SAA’s objectives this year for its anniversary performance? Ria S. Tobaccowala: Our main objective this year is to have a very high quality show. Ghungroo has come a long way over the past 20 years. It was originally just a small production between a few friends. This year our cast is bigger than last year’s, and we are experimenting with new dance acts and musical performances. THC: Are you going to commemorate Ghungroo’s 20th anniversary in any way?RST: The show is going to be commemorated through its quality and presentation. We have also tried to make sure there is a large alumni presence this year and are holding a special reception for them. We are also planning to do a short slideshow presentation to showcase the show’s progress through the last 20 years. THC: In Indian dance, are you free to invent your own choreography or do you follow an established pattern? What traditions are you drawing on in your dances? Are there any particular stories or histories that you are trying to tell? RST: The aim of the performances is to showcase the rich, diverse and evolving culture of the subcontinent. Every year, we have a classical dance, Bhangra, Hindi film, and Raas piece. These four dances reflect the constant variables in the culture.Classical Indian dance is one of the oldest forms of dance that has remained relatively true to its beginnings. Bhangra is a more modernized dance style that originates from the state of Punjab in Northern India. Over time the moves and music have inherited American popular music and culture, such as hip-hop. We also have fusion and modern pieces that combine different forms of dance with South Asian dance...and different regional dances to show the diversity of style across the subcontinent. A couple examples of these types of dances are Koli and Malayalee.In terms of stories and histories, we aim to show that the dynamic culture of the subcontinent has constant elements but also adapts and acquires many other cultures and styles. THC: How do you involve all kinds of dancers, from beginners to people who have been dancing for years, into the performances? RST: The fact that Ghungroo is all-inclusive and has no audition allows everyone to join in and perform. Over time Ghungroo has built the reputation of being a very open, fun, and diverse show that allows every undergraduate who is interested in performing the opportunity to perform. To me, this is the most amazing quality of the show—its ability to attract and resonate with a diverse set of people.

Now in its 71st season, the annual Lowell House Opera (LHO) production premiered on Wednesday, March 4 with its rendition of Verdi’s “Otello.” The show is produced by an assembly of volunteers, including Harvard undergraduate and graduate students, classical musicians, experienced opera singers, and amateur opera aficionados from the Greater Boston Area and beyond. The opera promises to be an exciting experience for traditional opera lovers, fans of Shakespearean theatre, and newcomers to the world of opera alike. “Otello” will run through March 14 in the Lowell Dining Hall.“Otello,” the second to last opera composed by 19th century Italian master Giuseppe Verdi, is one of his most famous pieces. The opera recreates the psychological tension and villainy of William Shakespeare’s play of the same title. Originally named “Iago,” the opera focuses on the vocal interplay between Othello and his traitorous ensign, Iago, who spends the course of the play engineering Othello’s downfall. According to Artistic Director and Conductor Channing Yu ’93, LHO’s production boasts a full orchestra to accompany this vocal interplay. The orchestra is comprised of a full rotation of 120 musicians, with about 80 represented in any given performance. Its score highlights the dramatic psychological dimensions of Iago’s sinister plotting as it unfolds on stage. “Verdi is so precise as a composer, no one instrument embodies anyone’s thought,” Yu says. “The orchestra shows the full range of Iago’s character.” The music of the orchestra is accompanied by an adult chorus, whose vocals are also complemented by a children’s chorus.While the opera is based on the Shakespearean play, LHO’s “Otello” has bypassed the traditional convention of featuring 16th century English dress styles for a 15th century Mediterranean aesthetic. Stage director Anna Fisher, who works at the Huntington Theatre Company, refers to the set, which is modeled after actual ruins from the island of Cyprus, as having an “earthly aesthetic.” “‘Otello’ is a story driven by a villain,” Fisher says. “It’s a sneaky set, with lots of places to hide.” Iago takes full advantage of the set throughout the show; as he infiltrates Othello’s mind, he conceals himself with the many openings and holes littered across the stage. In addition, the scenery enhances the on-stage action, which includes a rowdy drinking song, a tavern brawl, and other scenes of violence reminiscent of traditional Elizabethan theater. In keeping with the Mediterranean setting and plot, the costumes are a mix of old Venetian, Turkish, and Greek styles. Othello and Iago’s costumes, which abide by historical design, are cut from large pieces of fabric rather than stitched together from smaller pieces, a technique which Venetian tailors exercised in the 15th century to conserve material. However, costume designer Krystal Bly, a graduate from the New England Conservatory, explains that practicality and an appeal to the audience prevented LHO from being completely historically accurate, particularly in their choice of costume color. “Black was fashionable in the era, but we put people in different colors and women without veils,” she says. Othello’s costumes throughout the play are meant to reflect his descent into madness and self-deception. While at first his clothing is triumphantly colorful, it progressively darkens to red-black before becoming solid black.LHO has taken steps to make the play easier to understand for those who have never experienced opera before, especially for people who enjoy Shakespeare but find Italian opera difficult to understand or unapproachable. LHO will host its Symposium on Verdi’s ‘Otello’ Saturday at 12 p.m. in the Lowell House Library. Among those individuals explaining the opera to attendants are Robert Honeysucker, an internationally recognized baritone and voice pedagogue, Helen Greenwald, professor of Music History and Musicology at the New England Conservatory, and Harvard undergraduate Matthew A. Aucoin ’12, a member of the chorus and “Otello” enthusiast.—Staff writer Alec E. Jones can be reached at aejones@fas.harvard.edu.

You saw him center stage at the Olympic opening ceremonies in Beijing. His YouTube videos generate more views than some Billboard Top 100 artists. His record label Deutsche Gramophone headlines him as nothing less than “the future of classical music”. After a whirlwind of high-profile concerto engagements and an international recital tour brought some critics to dub 2008 the “Year of Lang Lang,” Chinese pianist turned classical music rockstar Lang Lang had a tall order to fill at this past Sunday’s Symphony Hall solo recital, a presentation of the Celebrity Series of Boston. His performance, which fused musical mastery with a hearty dose of his characteristic flair for the dramatic, proved all of the hype about him was well justified. Settling himself at the Steinway concert piano, Lang opened with a poetic rendition of Franz Schubert’s Piano Sonata No. 20 in A Major, D. 959. In the first movement, the interplay of soprano and tenor voices created a chorus of classical lines that conveyed a dialogue of teasing questions and indignant retorts. Raising a finger to his lips as if to silence the piano, Lang Lang physically signaled the dreamy transition into a barcarolle-like segment, which he executed with seamless tempo changes and delightful subito pianos. The distorted, showy embellishments critics have used to label Lang as a talented but immature pianist were completely absent from this piece, for Lang’s use of rubato was liberal but never stretched to the point of mannerism. The pianist swept the sonata to a climactic end with a flurry of majestic octaves and runs.Lang next plunged into an aggressive performance of Béla Bartók’s Piano Sonata, Sz. 80 that was almost terrifying in its technical execution. Harnessing the Steinway to produce a resounding bass undertone that pianists with a lighter touch so often lose, Lang beckoned us into the heat of Bartók’s chordal battle. After a virtuosic passage that unabashedly showcased the percussive capabilities and dissonant tones of the instrument, a plaintive melody, influenced by Bartók’s roots in folk music, resolved the chaos. Jerking out of this harmonic respite, Lang coaxed the coda from a steady trot of sharp staccatos into a thunderous gallop of arpeggiated exclamations. Lang transitioned flawlessly from the mad chaos of Bartók to the nuanced subtlety of the French impressionistic style with a few selections from Claude Debussy’s Preludes. It was these simple tone poems, not the virtuosic heavyweights that usually dominate any performer’s repertoire, which revealed the musical genius behind Lang’s commercial success. His interpretation of Debussy’s popular melody “The Girl with the Flaxen Hair” was ethereal but never flighty, thanks to his delicate yet pointed approach to the keyboard. Closing his eyes for most of the preludes, Lang occasionally tore himself from his musical trance to look towards the audience, as if to ensure that they too could visualize the serenity of a pond in Giverny straight out of a Monet painting. Lang’s rendition of “Fireworks,” the brilliant closing prelude, obviously displayed his technical facility, but his command of a remarkably flexible tonal palette deserved the most attention. The preludes, which became an amalgam of musical reflections under Lang’s touch, proved that while Lang sometimes employs frivolous shows of technique to draw in his audience, the thought and soul within his playing truly captivates listeners. With the crowd already coming to its feet, Lang jumped into Chopin’s “Heroique” Polonaise No. 6 in A-flat Major, his final number. The treacherous double thirds at the beginning were no obstacle to the pianist, who zipped through the chromatic introduction to settle into the stately main theme. In the military march, accented with crisp dotted rhythms and a precise backdrop of octaves, Lang brought out Chopin’s desire to incite Polish patriotism, though the pianist adopted a much faster tempo than is customary.In appreciation for the double curtain calls after every piece and the standing ovation at the end of the recital, Lang played Chopin’s delightful Etude, Opus 10, No. 3 as an encore. Again, the tempo was alarmingly fast at times and may have been objectionable to some sticklers to the classical tradition, but Lang’s spin on a Chopin standard was refreshingly quirky.The only thing missing from Lang’s Symphony Hall program was a performance of a piece by Franz Liszt, a composer and pianist with a flamboyant style who is seen as a forbearer to Lang. Lang’s romantic, rhapsodic, and showy interpretations of Liszt’s compositions are particularly acclaimed. In the 19th century, women reportedly swooned in response to Liszt’s dramatic performances and threw their handkerchiefs onto the stage in passionate admiration. No one fainted at Symphony Hall on Sunday, but Lang’s masterful playing and impeccable style has not gone unnoticed by the general public.

At the beginning of this year, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that it was going to stop pursuing litigation against individuals who participate in illegal person-to-person music sharing and instead focus on its fight with internet service providers. Without the threat of lawsuits, music downloading essentially becomes legal based upon an absence of consequence. This raises the questions: what does music actually cost, and what are our obligations, if any, as consumers of music?When Radiohead released “In Rainbows” last year, the band allowed their fans to ascribe their own monetary value to the music, asking them to pay as little or much for the CD as they saw fit. Other bands with large, loyal fan bases like Nine Inch Nails have since tried this experiment with varied levels of success. What this initiative ultimately amounts to is a kind of sentimental gratuity that fans can leave their favorite bands. Someone who gave Radiohead $10 for “In Rainbows” most likely did so out of a moral desire to reward the group for their work rather than a direct estimation of the songs’ monetary worth. Thus the question of music’s value is still unsolved by this scheme.Of course, a Mastercard commercial would tell us that music is “Priceless,” and as far as emotional value is concerned, this cliché is right on the money. Perhaps monetarily, though, the correct phrasing consumers are looking for is “without price” or “FREE!” When Beethoven debuted his Ninth Symphony 185 years ago, there were several things of which we can be certain, namely that there was no bootleg made of the performance, there were no “Best of Beethoven” CD’s for sale outside the concert hall, and Beethoven was not holding out on a record deal with Interscope. Why? Because a recordable medium for audio simply did not exist.When Thomas Edison and others perfected the technology of the gramophone, consumers could start bringing the music into their homes, and live performance was replaced by a physical artifact. But unlike paintings or sculptures, whose existence is only susceptible to a gradual aging of the materials with which they were created, the physical medium of recorded music has been in constant flux since the first version of the technology was invented. With subsequent evolution of storage formats, music has come to be valued in accord with technology pricing. 20-somethings from all of the last four generations have awoken one day to see their copy of “Sergeant Pepper’s the Lonely Hearts Club Band” drop precipitously in value since they first bought it: from vinyl to 8-track to cassette to CD. Quality of sound has changed in that time, leading to changes in prices, but the music that has made the leap from format to format has stayed the same. How can we say what it is really worth besides in emotional and aesthetic value?With the rise of MP3 and streaming audio, the costs of production and distribution intrinsic to older media of audio recording are being diminished and sometimes phased out altogether. Following the above history of recorded music, one would suppose that without technology cost, music would once again be “priceless.” In a sense, years of technological leaps have brought us back to square one, where people no longer collect music in its physical manifestation, but rather appreciate it without any costly artifacts. Unfortunately for us though, the artifice of the recording industry is too deeply engrained into our consumerist habits to simply celebrate this new freedom and set up free online catalogues.Now the industry, ostensibly decimated by p2p file sharing, has decided that music—which they had only ever valued based upon its technology—has some intrinsic monetary worth. They have invested in and advertised for systems like iTunes, they have sued children and housewives for felony piracy, they have created anti-sharing technology like DRM and made music lovers’ lives generally miserable—all in the name of making money off a relatively recent physical commodity that people have come to believe they need to pay for. As upon their first encounters with radio, the music industry has been slow to recognize the beauty of file sharing. They should embrace music’s performative origins and let go of selling the physical artifact once and for all. There is a lot more money in concerts these days, even for those who can sell albums. Consider the downloaded single a free preview that guarantees the band at least a $50 concert seat sale. Classical composers would have killed for that kind of advertising.As it stands now, the consumer’s pecuniary obligation to the music artists and industry is extremely ambiguous, especially now that the RIAA has taken its suits off the table. On one hand, iTunes is making large inroads into the traditional music retail market and demonstrating that some are still willing to buy their music. On the other hand, the plethora of music blogs, “free sites” like Rhapsody and Ruckus (now deceased), official band websites, Myspace music, and even just the power of Google allow consumers to find free MP3s of just about anything they could want. Why, then, do they keep buying music?Part of me says that it is guilt, paranoia, or morality while the rest of me sees it as simple stupidity. Consider for a moment music’s present and historic availability. Download as much as you want, go to concerts, and let it be up to the music industry to adapt to this hearkening back to a time before the music’s physical footprint prevailed in our lives. Music has been set free, so go get some.                                                     —Columnist Andrew F. Nunnelly can be reached at nunnelly@fas.harvard.edu.

You can imagine the sour state we received Mrs. Lewis in when she came bobbing down the steps of the church screaming, “Happy Easter, Mr. Moore! And Winnie! Our Savior is risen!”“He sure is,” Daddy said. He popped from the buggy, happy to get away from me. So the reverend’s wife began her prattle and I fell back against the seat. Ezekiel must have heard my mighty exhale from up front. His head turned in profile as he said, “I’s realized, Miss Winnie, that I never told you I was sorry about Mr. Trent.”“Oh, it’s fine—”“And I know you prolly don’t want to talk on it, but I just was wantin’ to tell you to enjoy such a pretty holiday.” Was peace nowhere to be found! “I wish I’da learned that real soon after Miss Pam and my boys went away.” He still couldn’t accept they’d been blown away? His ignorance flew all over me, and I was ready to bicker over why—precisely why—he thought they were still alive. Except I was assaulted with, “The day for peach cobbler has come!” Ezekiel was already helping me from the carriage, and it was too late to run from Mrs. Lewis. “I’ve put pecans in it this time! I tried it out last night—I had to try it—since nuts really shouldn’t be a part of fellowship if at least someone isn’t familiar with them! Fellowship, at the parsonage, again: can you even believe it, Winnie!”“Just barely!”“And the rain is holding off! This’ll just be something special!” She was dragging me up the steps.“Yes, so special.” I tensed, fearing exactly what she would say next. I grinned big as I grabbed for Daddy’s hand. But he was still down at the buggy, saying something to Ezekiel about parking. So all I could do was get Mrs. Lewis wound up on her parsonage luncheon (“The Reverend couldn’t help me prepare, though I’m sure lost souls take precedence over peppered pork!”). But I knew her dumb pity was creeping up. She would mention Trent, and what would happen? Would I pretend to be all torn up? Or would I absorb the shot with a smile and say excuse me I need to get out of this humidity it just trashes my hair. But if I dashed inside there’d only be more pity eyes, they’d be splayed out all over the foyer.Through my dread (my anger? I never should have come!) I heard her talking spell start to wind down. I blurted out, “Is it full up in there?”“Oh, yes, and it makes Reverend Lewis so happy. To be able to share Good News with such a crowd is a blessing. I just don’t know what we’re going to do about this Negro Problem.”Well, I could have cared less about this Negro Problem (was it one in particular or all of them?). But I did let my noodle think on it once Daddy and I squeezed in to the foyer. What else could I do as I waited there, horrified that someone’s condolence was about to explode on top of me?Daddy talked and talked away. I didn’t begrudge him his negotiating if rice prices were as crummy as he said. But was this my grand re-entry? Is this how things would be from here on out—me, cowering in the corner like a nun? Sister Winnie of the Heartless and Frumpy?Then I realized what I could do for the rest of my life—open a dress shop for lasses in mourning—and call it, what, The Gloomy Loom of Doom?“And that’s why my embroidered pigs are so rotten!” I heard blare from behind me.I froze at her voice! Where could I hide? What was even huge enough to hide me? A statue? A cross? An ironclad? There was nothing anywhere. A church foyer had never been so ruthless!Then I saw him. Next to the Easter egg crucifix stood Marshall Pellet. He would shield me from her. But was he alone? Too late to wait! I grabbed my skirt and charged. In the blur of flight I grabbed some sort of flower (a daylily?) from the arrangement I whizzed by. I held the thing up—its petals flapped and fluttered in the top speeds—then jammed it into the sleeve above my left hand. An orange wrist corsage on a black dress: just the thing for courage.Looking much fresher, it was no surprise my approach to Marshall would be stupendous. That old couple would be departing just as I arrived and—“Winifred, dear.”The ruby velvet glove clamped onto my arm. I managed a “Mrs. Graham” with the ghastliest smile that’s ever blighted a lady’s face. I looked into the eyes of Trent’s mother and felt just the way I did when I read about that Nepalese man charged by a rhinoceros.“I didn’t know if I could do it,” she said, sounding much graver than when she was discussing crocheted swine just a minute ago. “But I thought, it’s Easter. Yes it is. A day of living! Trent would have wanted me to come today. And seeing you here tells me I made the right choice. If you can do it, I can, Winnie. Because if Trent’s mother—who’d already had so many good years with him—couldn’t be here, then what would that mean for his fiancé? That’s what I thought to myself, Winnie, and now that I see us both together I know that we’re really one in the same. You know people can be united in grieving and in overcoming.”If my father hadn’t come just then I would have fallen over. I know it. I would have gone through the carpet, the wood floor, the stone foundation, and into my own grave. Because now I could see that burrowing into primordial bedrock was the only way I would get away from this mess. I clutched Daddy’s arm as I rassled my breathing. I didn’t even care about collecting myself until I saw Marshall heading towards us. It was a nice diversion—feeling the shock of seeing a small boy holding his hand. It’s easy to forget a man’s a father when he’s already a veteran and widower.“Marshall!” I said, taking his hand before he took mine.“Miss Moore.”“It’s good, it’s very good to see you!”“Good morning, Major Pellet,” said Mrs. Graham. Her voice had slammed the Major as she glanced my way.“Major,” said Daddy as he nodded to Marshall. “Terrific having you back. I bet this fellow’s pretty glad, too.” Daddy bent towards Marshall’s son. Then they left me behind as they went on and on about Gordon the darling seven-year-old. Mrs. Graham had been the one to keep him (with Marshall off fighting and his wife dead) so you can imagine the wonder she allowed herself in discussing the boy. She had just come to the 84th retelling of the failed riding demonstration she’d done for Gordon (“the brass quintet should mostly heal, but our horse will never go near another trombone”) when she suddenly shut up. Her violent stare moved the rest of us to turn and gape.“Mr. Moore, ’scuse me,” said Ezekiel, “just wanted to let you know I put away the buggy without too much problems. It’s up on Wimbley Street.”“That’s just fine,” Daddy said with cheer.“So I’ll be waitin’ in front of the parsonage after luncheon.”“Yes, that’s good, Ezekiel,” Daddy said.Ezekiel nodded and we watched him go. At the sanctuary doors, he stopped before an usher, who was doling out fans to the folks going in. “So,” said Marshall, “they’ve even come into the church.”Mrs. Graham turned with a leer and said, “We’ve kept them in the back but who knows for how long.” Ezekiel stepped even closer to the usher, who was still giving out fans to others walking by. “Why do you still have him, Hill?” Marshall asked Daddy with a smile.“He’s awfully handy. He never acted up like the others. Of course, no one wants to employ him now, so I thought why not keep him around for jobs I’m too busy for. He’s well-bred—with his manners, I mean—and he’s good for watching Winnie when I can’t go with her into town.”Mrs. Graham nodded, disbelieving, and the organ rumbled from inside. Now Ezekiel moved right in front of the usher’s face. A reluctant chat was beginning. I thought I heard the older man say that “it don’t get hot back where the Negroes set” but Ezekiel persevered, and got himself a fan, then entered the sanctuary.Marshall shook his head. “Niggers and Northerners. Think the rules of The Gates apply to everyone but them.”“The Gates?” I asked.“Of Heaven.”I couldn’t ask what he meant before Daddy said, “Shoot, Winnie, we don’t even have our seats yet.”

“You do not conquer your uncommonness, it is granted you as a gift.” Jonas Wergeland, born into an underprivileged family, had only one dream: conquest. He had an indescribable and all-consuming need to prove that he was someone special and that he could seduce the hearts of a nation. He even managed to win the hearts of the people with a mega-popular television show. Yet his weakness for power and narcissistic self-obsession twisted his personage beyond any other explanation but one: a demon.“The Conqueror,” Jan Kjaerstad’s second book in a trilogy that also includes “The Seducer” and “The Discoverer,” doesn’t spin a single yarn so much as weave from several. This web struggles to trace back, through the events of Jonas’ life, what could have made this man so evil. Yet throughout “The Conqueor,” it’s hard to see anything demonic about Jonas at all, despite the glaring fact that he’s on trial for killing the woman of his dreams. Kjaerstad makes it easier, instead, to simply laugh at and pity Jonas’ weaknesses in the face of his environment. Ultimately, one can’t help but sympathize with a man who sacrifices everything he loves in search of a dream: “He could not stand it: first to seduce, to conquer, an entire nation and then… to stand naked in all his vacuity before his wife, the woman he loved, the only person he really wished to conquer; he was a conquistador who had won everything, then suddenly found himself confronted with a culture which he did not understand and which he therefore had to destroy.”“The Conqueror” is a pleasant, easy read since it’s broken up into convenient and short chapters. The plot is divided into short scenes in Jonas’ life that attempt to reconstruct and represent the person he has become. The order of these scenes—neither chronological nor under the sway of any organizing voice—and the degree to which each story is important to the novel’s framework are both arbitrary. Unfortunately, a handful of these sections seem to leave Jonas’ story half-told. Chapters that deal explicitly with the death of Margurete, Jonas’ wife, why she may have been murdered, and the subsequent trial each seem like subjects too sensitive for the source of narrator to dwell on. The professor, our transcriber, writes, “Suddenly she (the secret source) falls silent. She has never done that before. Stayed quiet for so long… All stories deal with what cannot be said, cannot be written.” Instead, the story moves on to various other aspects of Jonas’s life: his history of ex-lovers or his adventures with childhood friends.Despite this dark and mysterious diversion, Kjaerstad manages to keep the vast majority of this novel light and upbeat. He easily manages this by narrating his story as a conversation between a secret source and the professor asked to write the biography of Jonas Wergeland. There are some chapters where the professor just reflects on his secret source, who he refers to as his savior, but also on the life of Jonas, and every story ties into the demon that Jonas Wergeland really was.Jonas had been reminded from the day that he was born that he would never overcome his commonness, that he would never amount to anything great. These thoughts haunted him so often that Jonas had become a man who “had an almost pathological need to feel different” and to prove that he was anything but ordinary. Kjaerstad’s main character is truly the strength of the novel. Jonas’ consciousness and his growth into an adult, framed by an enormous Napoleon complex, never cease to fascinate. It’s even more intriguing to read about a man that destroyed or abandoned anyone he ever loved (e.g. his best friends, his wife, his brother) because of his fear that these people would leave him. This fear would render confirmation of itself. Kjaerstad deftly creates anecdotes out of the dark places of Jonas’ past, showing their significance as catalysts for his desire to be a conqueror—anecdotes that explore this fear of becoming ‘ordinary’ manifest themselves as catalysts for the neurosis that would culminate in his murderous deed.This sort of formula, however, can stray toward the annoying when Kjaerstad resorts to rhetorical questions: “What makes a conqueror? What makes a murderer?” It’s nice to have some reminders as to what this scattered form of storytelling is building up to, but at a certain point it begins to sound like nagging, and the story risks losing its sense of wonder. However, on the whole, Kjaerstad’s novel addresses the ever-growing pressures to be someone great or do something memorable. Such are the pressures of today, when in schools and workplaces alike, there is a drive to be the best and to stand out. Everyone wants to be a modern day hero; everyone wants to be remembered. This was the dream of Jonas Wergeland, but his pursuit of remembrance and glory only brought him defeat.

Before all other things, what pervades Ruth Lepson’s work is a sense of the artist as perpetually emergent. Lepson, a Massachusetts local and the New England Conservatory’s poet-in-residence, has the liberating aura of a contemporary poet whose work remains relatively unknown. In light of this fact, her new collection of poems, “I Went Looking for You,” enriches a sense of the human experience that is at turns both emotionally resonant and aesthetically restrained.Lepson’s poetry is filled with tender descriptions of places that clearly hold significance to her as a Massachusetts local. These locations are, more often than not, oriented around the ocean—especially the seaside town of Swampscott, MA. In particular, “Ocean at Bay, Swampscott” lovingly describes the poem’s namesake with an eye for detail only poets can manage. Lepson describes the many colors of Swampscott’s water—“blue ice, glint-white, brown”—paying attention to every creature that comes along and enjoys the scene with her: turtles, a Dalmatian, and a pigeon. Lepson boldly declares: “I love this town.”The sea also figures as an object of love throughout the collection. In “Separation,” a nostalgic description of a failed marriage addressed to the narrator’s partner, Lepson ruminates on the intimacy of swimming as “the first thing in months that felt like you.” The narrator’s feelings for the ocean are bittersweet and complex, in the same way that feelings towards an ex-partner would be. “The Boy” describes the sea as “a cold dream,” which is “on the surface scary, empty.” Indeed, one of the earlier poems, “Where Seagulls Fly,” reveals that the narrator’s seaside sense of relief stems from it being “close to the end of something.” Lepson holds two forms of transience parallel: that of the open ocean against that of human life.Others among Lepson’s collection—those poems that seem to be more portrait than anything else—are caught up in the concept of mortality. “Motet for Mom” consists purely of fragmented conversations between a daughter and her hospitalized mother. The poem is made all the more powerful for its ambivalence toward the poignant dialogue exchanged between loved ones who will shortly be torn apart from each other. “October 7, 1994,” “For Robert Creely,” and “Selah,” compiled in succession, are each dedicated to Lepson’s friends who have passed away. These poems struggle with balancing the celebration of life and the mourning of death. “How tired I am of appreciating the gift of life,” Lepson writes.For Lepson, death is not the only form that dissolution between people can take. “The Poem of J” is placed between “Motet for Mom” and the elegiac triptych. The narrator remembers her past with the titular “J”—the things that made her angry, things that now seem petty—during an impromptu phone call after many years apart. In “Steps,” a changing relationship “dismembers [the narrator’s] life.” For the poet, losing someone is just that—even when they’re still alive. Lepson deals heavily in the theme of divorce. Her narrators mourn and reflect on the changing nature of relationships. The paired set of poems, “The Day of Our Divorce Hearing” and “Dissolution,” emphasize the internal conflict of an untenable emotional connection. The former includes lines like, “Lately I don’t feel as if I lived with you,” and later on: “I love you as much as I ever did.” “Concert at the Gardner Museum” and “Lobby of a New York Hotel” meditate on the power that even the passer-by can hold over a person. “Imagining the Imprisonment of Ms. Lu Hsiu-Lien” and “Anne Sexton on the Cover” describe not a physical death but a death of the essences of people “from what was done to them,” from incarceration to exploitation. All are reflections on the way people change.This transience, this living “close to the end of something,” reflects on Lepson’s observations about people as well. Lepson reveals why she writes so fondly of these places—places like Swampscott’s shores—in the very first poem in the collection “These Trees.” After the narrator has left, the trees will still be there just as they always have been, and her emotions “will have been / just that / mine.” Her locations are timeless, though she and her loved ones may not be.“Clark Park,” the poem from which the collection gets its title, combines meditations on people with ones on places. Clark Park itself is filled with trees whose “trunks are solid,” ready to exist for many years. The people are fickle: “I know if you touched me / I could relax. / I went looking for you, angry / at myself for that.” As such, the emotions are complex and mercurial. However, the collection closes with the reconciliatory “He Called and All,” where the narrator “persisted / and smiled since life / is surrounded with life.”Much like the places Ruth Lepson affectionately describes in her poems, her themes are timeless. Her words are heart-felt and artfully laid out. The poems are lively in their melancholy and accepting in the face of mortality. Passionately human, “I Went Looking For You” is a collection that feels at once familiar and astounding.

It’s only been a few centuries since art has become a thing apart from the rest of the social world. It is only in our modern bourgeois society that we’ve exiled artistic product to hermetic galleries and museums, when dance has been marginalized to the stage, and literature to the privacy of one’s bedroom. It wasn’t so long ago that art was profoundly social in character, when the retelling of stories brought the whole tribe together, when depicting played a central role in religious rites, when dance was the act that taught man how to work and live in synchrony. OK, yes, I’ll admit, it was pretty long ago when dancing around the campfire equipped us to hunt down our dinner in concert, but not so long ago that it should seem perfectly natural for us that art plays so small a social role, that it has become a superficial structure, layered on top of “real” material existence. In fact, I could argue that art, in its original form, is social in character. It’s only the bizarre processes of modernization that have distorted art into something individual. But art has not lost all of its social character. Its production does continue to take place in the heart of our society, in the center of our cities. This art is not merely a commodity of pleasure, to be bartered and sold on the market, to be consumed by those with the money to buy it. No, the public here, like that of the original, natural forms of art, is the surrounding community. There’s performance art, which takes place in the public sphere. Some of it is like that of Improv Everywhere, which occurs just for the pleasurable (if perplexing) spectacle. Other performance art is like that of Tehching Hsieh, which is profoundly political and aims to effect a change in its audience’s consciousness. But the art that I’m writing here about is more than just performance, it is performative. I’m writing about the art that transformed Bogota, Colombia from a capital of corruption and crime into a city with crime and murder rates lower than neighboring South American metropolises. I’m writing about “Cultural Agency.”Cultural agency is the philosophy, most notably espoused by Harvard Professor Doris Sommer, that every person has the power to change the culture in which he lives. It is embodied in Bogota’s successful plan of rehabilitating respect for its law by replacing traffic cops with mimes. It is the motivating idea behind giving photographic cameras to the poverty-stricken children in the bombed-out Gaza Strip and in Rio de Jainero’s slums. It is the force behind the writing workshops for the homeless that take place here in Cambridge itself. Cultural agency posits that by having the opportunity to get involved with art, whether it is the opportunity to interact with performing mimes, to take photographs of one’s experiences, or to record and create one’s stories, one can assert control of one’s own life and change the flow of the world.In these instances, art is profoundly social. It is geared toward social change: the processes of creation generate a populace of self-aware individuals and their product stands as a powerful witness to the current state of their society. It is a dual movement that works on the individual and society at the same time. It is a mode of thinking about art that does not alienate the artist from his society or his product from that world. Rather, it recognizes the inextricable link between the two. One can argue that art is frivolous, that it should be the last thing that the homeless and poor are concerned about. But the truth is that they are interested. They do come to the writing workshop table on Friday and they do return the next, with stories written down or with tales to recount out loud. They find something there in the process, what it is exactly, I would not presume to say. All I know is what I see: they do pick up the cameras and go out and take pictures. Art, as understood through the lens of cultural agency, has great social potential. It is merely about restoring art’s position to the center of our society, making the arts available to all and consumable by all, handing out cameras and laptops so that anyone can post his photograph online, can publish his novel for the enjoyment of anyone and everyone. Yes, that is a dream, but it is not so far from becoming reality. The day is not so far away when we will be able to have an art that is woven within the fabric of our social reality. It’s only a matter of us beginning to sew, beginning to mend the distance that we impose all too often between art and society by making our own art, however we can.                                                                            —Columnist Sanders I. Bernstein can be reached at sbernst@fas.harvard.edu.

“Hold the big revelations,” Bono warbles on U2’s latest single, the fun but overworked “Get On Your Boots.” And with this, the charismatic frontman offers an all-too-appropriate appraisal of “No Line on the Horizon,” the band’s highly anticipated twelfth full-length release—an album with a few solid rock cuts but no instant classics or spiritual transcendence.The five-year buildup to “No Line” has been long and labored, including terminated sessions with Rick Rubin at Abbey Road Studios, an extended visit to Morocco, and the enlistment of longtime collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois as not only producers, but fellow songwriters. What makes this album so disappointing is that the past half-decade has ultimately yielded a cohesive and dense group of songs, but not an exciting record.The churning title track opens the album with a catchy, upbeat riff over a wash of twinkling electricity, providing a level of intensity the subsequent tracks fail to maintain. The song explodes over pounding drums that grow more distant behind the whirling backdrop of fuzz. The lyrics, punctuated by Bono’s floating woah-oh harmonies, get sillier, hinting at the rest of the album’s lack of depth: “She said, ‘time is irrelevant, it’s not linear’ / Then she put her tongue in my ear.” Attempts at musical experimentation—electronics, techno sampling, and global influences—have yielded U2’s best (“Achtung Baby”) and worst (“Zooropa”) efforts, and the results here are middling. Their only “experimental” album that can be called an unequivocal success was 1991’s “Achtung Baby”—and nothing on “No Line” is as rocking as “The Fly,” as unexpectedly joyful as “Ultraviolet,” or as beautifully distorted as “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses.” Here, the electronic ornamentation sounds rich and layered on some songs, but jumbled and confused on others.One manifestation of this is found in the ambient intros that sound so disconnected from their respective songs. Some tracks, such as “Fez—Being Born,” recover from this, while others aren’t as fortunate. One such track, “Moment of Surrender,” is much too slow and labored to occupy its seven minute length; the drums sound overly monotonous and lifeless, and there’s an unnecessary, unbelievably boring guitar solo in the closing minutes. Bono yelps in an admirable attempt at soulfulness, but it sounds forced and disingenuous.The grinding intro of “Get On Your Boots” is catchy, but gives way to awkwardly tossed off verses within a handclap-filled massacre of Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up,” complete with puerile rhymes like “I got a submarine, you’ve got gasoline!” With several stilted shifts in tempo and wobbly Guns n’ Roses-esque guitar flourishes, U2 display their weakness for over-embellishment, foregoing the fun for a scatterbrained collage.The lyrics certainly don’t compensate for these shortcomings, sometimes serving to preemptively bar songs from brilliance. Admittedly, U2 is famous for writing verses of the “uno-dos-tres-catorce” variety, but they’ve proven capable of penning lyrics that match the sweeping grandeur of their most epic singles or, alternately, create a stark and touching vulnerability—as seen in the humble musings of “Achtung Baby.” Many of the songs on “No Line” have compelling rhythms and development—take “Unknown Caller,” a long track employing recordings of birdsongs, chiming guitars, and shimmering organs. But electronic blips become self-parody when paired with lyrics about computers, and it’s beyond laughable to hear Bono and the Edge employ the inspirational “Force quit and move to trash” in an otherwise quality song. “The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear,” Bono sings on another track, and it shows.The best songs retain their spontaneity despite the layered production and forgettable lyrics. “I’ll Go Crazy If I Don’t Go Crazy Tonight” redeems its dopey title with swelling violins, a soaring chorus, and an impassioned falsetto turn from Bono. On the lively “Breathe”—a contender for the album’s best song—he spits the lyrics with so much snarling fervor that when he shouts “I found grace” in the song’s final lap, it’s wholeheartedly convincing.Unfortunately, the rest of the album seems lost in a muddled haze, the result of Eno’s overstuffed production coupled with the band’s own overindulgence in their ambient inclinations and goofy lyrical tendencies. The addition of “No Line on the Horizon” to the band’s impressive and tremendously varied catalog surely reinforces their willingness to take risks, but some of their choices elude rather than elucidate. U2 may move in mysterious ways, but they’ll need a return to basics if they hope to recapture their former mastery.—Staff writer Jessica R. Henderson can be reached at jhenders@fas.harvard.edu.

The Boy Least Likely To is unabashedly cutesy, even by the standards of twee pop. Not content with the softly-sung diary entries that have come to typify the leagues of Belle and Sebastian imitators, or the corresponding tendency towards cardigans and dorky glasses, The Boy Least Likely To takes fuzzy-wuzziness one step further by actually writing from the perspective of a shy, lonely elementary-schooler. Cuteness permeates every aspect of their newest release, “The Law of the Playground,” from the album title to the album closer “Fairytale Ending.” This aesthetic of over-the-top whimsy and childlike wonder works most successfully in the composition and arrangement of the instrumental parts. “The Law of the Playground” is catchy and exuberant throughout. With an ear for interesting chord changes that calls to mind the Fiery Furnaces, The Boy Least Likely To has mastered indie pop’s delicate blend of accessible melodies and nontraditional harmonic structure. Riffs like the fiddle and banjo unison part on “When Life Gives Me Lemons I Make Lemonade” beg to get stuck in your head and stay there. The melodies are well supported by the lush instrumental arrangements, which add glockenspiel, tuba, banjo, trombone, and recorder to the standard indie-pop acoustic guitar, hyperactive synth, and crisp, peppy drums. These instruments are densely layered, with the guitar taking the back seat and providing a base for unison melodies on banjo and horns during the instrumental breaks. Singer Jof Owen has the voice for twee, an expressive near-whisper that works particularly well when multitracked into dense harmonies. His timbre reinforces their aesthetic of naïveté, but sounds a bit thin when soloing over acoustic guitar on tracks like “The Worm Forgives The Plow.”  Owen’s vulnerable, intimate tone draws attention to his lyrics, which are rich in metaphor and often veer towards intentional self-parody, with lines like “I need a cookie and a hug.” The lyrics work best when they undermine, rather than reinforce, the fuzzy cuteness of, well, everything else about the band.It is easy enough to create a wistful childhood fantasy land, but it is more interesting to examine its borders, where the defense mechanism of regression into childhood breaks down either from its own deliberate obliviousness or from an encounter with the so-called real world.  “I Box Up All The Butterflies” shows this fairy tale collapsing under the weight of its own puerility. The narrator sneaks away from his friends and family to set traps “with fishhooks and string,” capturing a butterfly to bottle and bury in the yard as he listens to “the beat of its little heart / and its wings / struggling from under an upturned glass.” Why does he do it? When faced with the perfection and innocence of spring, and his own fear of the birds and the bees, he says: “something inside me made me want to tear it apart.” With this in mind, the listener’s disarmed revulsion upon first hearing music so overwhelmingly naïve can be seen as a natural defense mechanism, a way to mask our own insecurities by inflicting violence on something pure. In album opener “Saddle Up,” this world of puppies and playgrounds faces an external, rather than internal, threat: a rapidly approaching adulthood full of unknowns, or, as the narrator puts it, “a big scary world out there just waiting for me.” This, however, seems to be a much more manageable threat than personal insecurity. The narrator begs us to “saddle up” and to approach the unknown with courage and curiosity. At other times, the interface between childhood and adulthood is not destructive, as in “I Box Up All The Butterflies,” or monumental and adventurous, as in “Saddle Up,” but simply blurred for poetic effect. Lines like “I’ve got a little bag of marbles and a catapult wound around my fingers” show the narrator conflating the playthings of kids and grownups, reframing medieval warfare as simple schoolyard mischief.  If the saccharine sweetness of The Boy Least Likely To doesn’t trigger your gag reflex, there is plenty to be enjoyed here. Their musical arrangements are hyperactive and original, and their lyrics turn a critical eye towards the cutesy aesthetic of the twee tradition from which the band emerged. The band practically begs to be mocked; in fact, their self-identification with the shy kid who was bullied on the playground shows their position to be entirely contingent on this type of scorn and lashing out. But their self-awareness prevents them from lapsing into self-pity, and the result is an album that explores from all angles the ambiguous, awkward, and disorienting territory between the world of children and adults.—Staff writer Mark A.

Before it became a vehicle for instigating turf wars and peddling Chicken McNuggets, hip-hop existed as a rich fusion of four elements—DJing, breakdancing, rapping, and graffiting. These elements collectively comprised an alternative form of entertainment and self-expression for inner-city youth, while creating a burgeoning impetus for social change. At the center of this cultural maelstrom was Grandmaster Flash, né Joseph Saddler, who, along with fellow DJs Kool Herc and Afrika Bambaata, formed a veritable holy trinity of hip-hop. In the 30 years since Saddler’s heydey, however, the genre’s rough edges have been whittled down to reveal a slick, commercially malleable force to be reckoned with. With his first studio album in 20 years, the ambitiously titled “The Bridge: Concept of a Culture,” Saddler exposes this tension in its harshest light. The legendary turntablist struggles to remain relevant in the culture that he created and falters consistently, alternating between brilliant displays of his forte and a weak compliance with cliched notions of marketable hip-hop songs. The grand master consistently becomes ensnared in sounds and influences that are not his own. Saddler, who debuted his craft at block parties and nightclubs throughout the South Bronx in the 1970s, puzzlingly indulges in bass-laden, ominous beats that elicit doomsday scenarios and desolate imagery. “What if hip-hop was never born?” an electronically slurred voice asks on “What If,” before KRS-One delves into a harrowing description of this hypothetical world. Another portion of the album is dedicated to bland, generic grooves that are heavily indebted to R&B, rather than hip-hop. Mr. Cheeks inexplicably raps about how he enjoys the “vibe” of a “live band,” on “Grown & Sexy,” and the track accordingly sounds as if a DJ played a negligible role in its creation.Luckily, “The Bridge” is not completely devoid of convincingly boisterous party starters. The brooding “What If” is followed by a much-needed upswing in the form of “Tribute To The Breakdancer,” an exuberant celebration of hip-hop’s very own dance form. Saddler builds up intensity with a spirited salute, bellowed over hand claps and a prerecorded roaring crowd. By the time he gleefully announces, “I’m gonna name drop!” excitement reaches a crescendo with a b-boy roll call and fantastic usage of The Incredible Bongo Band’s classic “Apache” drum break. DJ Kool, perhaps best known for the perennial party favorite “Let Me Clear My Throat,” is featured on “Here Comes My DJ.” “DJ ready? Dance floor ready? Everybody ready? Let’s go!” he shouts, before vigorously imploringly listeners to put their hands up, shout on command, and perform a series of other delightfully nonsensical tasks for the sake of a good time.No fewer than 28 contributors make an appearance on “The Bridge,” including lesser known MCs as well as established names like Q-Tip, Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg, and Big Daddy Kane. Unsurprisingly, several lines are dedicated to paying homage to the man laying down the tracks—“Before rappers was turning mics on, he was up at 63 Park, playing the right songs,” Lordikim notes deferentially on “Bronx Bombers.” Perhaps in a misguided attempt to echo the uncomplicated wordplay of hip-hop’s early days, the lyrical content becomes hopelessly mired in uninventive rhymes and hackneyed phrases. On “I Got Sumthin’ To Say,” Lordikim flows over the energetic, drum-heavy track to cringe-inducing effect: “Baby, you bad—not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good.” Paired with insipid production, these lyrical offenses render several tracks unremarkable at best.“He was the first to put his fingertips on vinyl, spinning backwards and that’s why today he’s known as an idol,” we’re reminded of Grandmaster Flash’s past innovations on “Bronx Bombers.” Unfortunately, even with a promising line-up and an abundance of talent, the idol fails to deliver. Saddler appears to be disoriented by the myriad directions his culture has taken, and instead of connecting these concepts, “The Bridge” ultimately amounts to an odd amalgamation of garbled influences and mediocre songs.

For singer-songwriter Neko Case, writing alt-country songs teeming at the brim with a mixture of nature, love, and free-spirited humor is all but, well, second nature. On her new album, “Middle Cyclone,” her skillful imagery—featuring killer whales and lovesick tornadoes—continues to prevail, bringing forth an album full of integrity and purity rarely found on an artist’s seventh studio release. While Case remains true to the form established on her previous work, the original appeal of her ethereal voice and fanciful melodies has not yet been lost.Originally from Alexandria, VA, the 38-year-old singer came to popularity after her work on “Mass Romantic,” the first studio recording by Vancouver-based indie rock sensation The New Pornographers. However, with the release of her first solo album shortly after, Case was able to find her niche in her own, inventive form of Southern music. Removed from the lush pop arrangements and multiple vocalists of The New Pornographers, Case is able to fill the void on her solo albums with her own sultry harmonies and unexpected turns.Case’s talents are showcased on the album’s first single, “People Got a Lotta Nerve,” which begins as a lively pop tune reminiscent of the cheerful, British ballads of The Smiths. The laidback guitar riff and cheery melody flow effortlessly into the bridge, where sudden chord changes, varying vocal register, and clever lyrics full of internal rhymes result in an unexpected divergence. The instrumental fade out adds an eloquent touch to the end of the song. In “This Tornado Loves You,” the raw force of Case’s melodies breaks out of its cage. The song begins with constant guitar tremolo and quick, brushed cymbal strokes, feeling like an orchestrated locomotive marching lazily through the countryside. Once Case enters with her famed pathos, the train never stops rolling. The song’s morphological character is only briefly disrupted by the piano and string fills. These examples of clever instrumentation and uplifting melody are Case at her best.“I’m an Animal” adds some color to the album with an organ in the beginning and a chorus of backup vocals. The song is short, but the combination of the tambourine beat, thumping base, and celestial harmonies make this song one of the album’s most evocative.Despite the continued surprises, there are times when the album teeters on the verge of redundancy. With the constant nature theme and the simple chord progressions, there are moments when the untiring voice of Case is not enough. In “Fever,” country influences are emphasized with the twang of the guitar in the background, but despite an unanticipated tempo change, the track lacks a strong melody, making her usual form and instrumentation seem stale and tiresome. The trouble is that when Case does try to change her tune, the songs often become much less appealing. “Prison Girls” is an ominous song with a Latin-rhythmic feel that is a change from the liveliness of the other tracks. Case has a chance to sing in a darker, more minor tone, and the instrumentation lends itself to a more complex mix of sounds and riffs, but the song as a whole drags on and does not seem suitable for the delicacy of Case’s voice.On “I’m an Animal,” Case declares: “My courage is roaring like the sound of the sun...I am an animal.” Inscribed in these lyrics lies the essence of “Middle Cyclone”; the combination of Case’s passionate voice, poignant melodies, and powerful storytelling reveal the primal essence of the album. Even when she missteps, Case’s album displays an imaginative and skillful artist, emotionally devoted to her craft.

Ever wondered what happens after the Oscars end, the paparazzi leave, and the stars disperse into the night? As Jamie Foxx’s video for “Blame It” finally reveals to us ugly people, they all show up at the same shady club and chill with each other. That’s right: Hollywood is just as incestuous as any Harvard student group. But cooler. Because, mercifully, the alcohol won’t run out at midnight. Sure, the music video is mostly stereotypical, and a little low-budget in appearance, with all the same images we’ve seen a million times: flashy cars and sunglasses at night, 30 identical and extremely inebriated extras in mini-dresses, and endless bottles of flowing alcohol. All of this is held together by Auto-Tuned vocals proclaiming the virtues of seducing young women by telling them to “blame it on the alcohol.” Classy. But the sheer number of celebrity cameos makes up for the lack of ingenuity. In rapid succession, Forest Whitaker, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ron Howard, Samuel L. Jackson, T-Pain, Quincy Jones, Cederic the Entertainer, and some less famous people are paraded onscreen almost too quickly for you to figure out what the hell is going on. If you’re counting, between them that makes 3 Academy Awards, 7 Academy Award nominations, 28 Grammys, and 94 Grammy nominations, all colluding on this one fateful night on the dance floor. Ultimately, this video is awesome for one simple reason: the number of absurd moments resulting from thiseclectic procession of famous people: Ron Howard is in a club raising his glass to a bunch of drunk people not named Michael, George, or George Michael. T-Pain does some kind of cheesy dance move I am certain he first witnessed on “So You Think You Can Dance?” Samuel L. Jackson is at any given time buttressed by at least three pairs of breasts. Foxx seems to be having the least fun, as he can’t seem to get his girl to loosen up.Also good are the rare scenes that suggest Jamie Foxx may be shrewdly making fun of the cheesiness of his own video. During the requisite money raining scene, Foxx actually puts the bills into his pocket as if to say, “Gee, this economy isn’t conducive to the gangsta lifestyle anymore.” And he has to be making fun of the rap genre in those scenes where he is dancing with a set of back-up dancers wearing matching hideous sequined tracksuits. It’s alright though if he doesn’t care for rap culture all that much. He seems to have more fun hanging out with movie stars anyway. —Crystal Huang

In his debut, “I Love College,” Asher Roth takes us into his world of collegiate debauchery by inserting a DVD marked “Last Nite!” into the television and singing “That party last night was awfully crazy / I wish we taped it”—what a relief he did! The party he spends the next four minutes rapping about is a modern day version of National Lampoon’s Delta House, complete with mattresses falling from second floor windows, a strip poker game, and even a grandma shooting a ball out of her mouth to score a winning shot in beer pong. The camera work makes it feel as if I really am watching a video a frat brother made on his handheld. I want to be at this party. I want to “Pass out at three, wake up at 10 / Go out to eat then do it again.” But I don’t want to be Asher Roth. Where are his friends? Why did he arrive and leave alone? How many pictures of him and the bulldog mascot are going to appear on Facebook at approximately 9:07 a.m. tomorrow morning? Sure, the party seems epic, but Roth’s night, save for random hookups with debatably catatonic girls, is nothing special.  Roth finds salvation in that his message—drilled into your head via lyrics, images, and his Belushi-knockoff T-shirt—is a universal one. After all, what normal college student doesn’t love a night of ridiculous drunken fun? If I was Asher Roth and this was my college experience, I’d find some real friends, hopefully kiss the hot girls playing poker, and never ever leave. Apparently Roth, a real life West Chester University dropout, is not one to practice what he preaches. Perhaps a few more years in school will teach him proper Saturday night social conduct.—Victoria J. Benjamin

Soft-core porn has rarely been as wonderfully unsexy as in Filipino director Brillante Mendoza’s thoroughly engaging drama “Serbis.” Rather than exposing the unseen underworld of the sex-for-sale industry, the film—shot in Tagalog with English subtitles—explores the complex moral conflicts that all-too-guilty pleasures cause in a country like the Philippines, itself conflicted by the secular influences left by decades as a Western territory on its actively religious tradition. Nominated for the Palme d’Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival and showing at the Brattle Theatre through Sunday, Mendoza’s creation, despite lacking a distinctive plot or any particular innovation, is compelling nonetheless.“Family” holds center stage, both as the name of the rundown adult film theatre that serves as the Pineda clan’s home and sole source of income, and as the core group responsible for the film’s relational dilemmas. Set against the background of a lawsuit between matriarch Nanay Flor (Gina Pareño) and her estranged husband, the film displays a day in the life of her large extended family’s impoverished existence. Her daughter Nayda (Jacklyn Jose) resents the unbreakable ties to this home that an unexpected pregnancy (and the ensuing marriage) reinforced, and her ambiguous romantic interest in her cousin Ronald (Kristoffer King) further complicates her emotions. Cousin Alan (Coco Martin) has impregnated his girlfriend, Merly (Mercedes Cabral)—a one-way ticket to the altar and another mouth to feed. And all the while, “service” men gather in the theatre’s lobby and cinema, selling themselves to the gay frequenters for as much as 300 pesos—the equivalent of about six American dollars—for “full-service.” Despite the seemingly unique living situation, the normalcy of the characters’ condition is apparent, highlighted by the wonderfully realistic Filipino home and the convincingly resigned attitude the characters take toward their strife. The noise of motorbikes and jeepneys permeate many scenes, capturing the desperate chaos of the city. The sex is graphic—blow jobs are not faked, full nudity is not uncommon—but it does not possess the showiness or glamour of its Hollywood equivalent, and every sexual scene lacks a sense of arousal; the act, it seems, cannot truly be enjoyed. Awkward as it may be to watch any sex scene in a theatre, the most disturbing aspect of watching these relations stems from the look of unpleasant necessity, rather than pleasure, that occupy the participants’ faces. A nagging guilt, like the unpleasant boil on Cousin Alan’s ass, seems to haunt this most natural of drives for everyone.“I’m a certified nurse,” Nayda sighs as she looks out a window. “What the hell am I doing here?” Indeed, this seems to be the underlying sentiment of all the characters. An education being the only sure way to leave the dirty streets, the perceived helplessness of her position can only be explained by the stalemate on progress that tradition has caused. Likenesses of the Virgin Mary coexist alongside portraits of nude women; “Fucking relatives!” yells Nanay Flor when she hears the news of Merly’s pregnancy, but responsibility makes disowning her family as unthinkable an option as abortion.Mendoza clearly displays the complex layout of the theatre and of the characters’ lives, but does not develop his subjects’ inner-workings any further than can be deciphered from the their captured actions. Actually, his faults lie in the moments when he strays from this show-don’t-tell strategy. When Ronald mistakenly gives a customer too much change, his worry seems too contrived; it has long been apparent that the family barely has enough money to live on, and the artificiality of this event unnecessarily reminds the audience that they are watching a carefully-constructed make-believe family and not the intimate goings-on of reality. Though the Western viewer may be confused by the casually dressed lawyer, the small open store-front of the theatre, or the way that Nanay yells and hits a passive Alan after hearing of his irresponsibility, those familiar with the nearly universal characteristics of a Filipino city and familial dynamics will be moved by the accuracy with which Mendoza captures the environment of his characters.By the end of “Serbis,” no problems have been resolved. One cousin throws his clothes into a backpack and, without a word, leaves the theatre, meaningfully weaving his way against the candle-bearing crowd of a funeral procession. But the rest are left behind to attend to their dilapidated movie house-of-homosexuals, caught between the old world and the new. “I’m not choosing sides!” shouts Naday in an earlier scene, and this attitude may be the root of their woes after all. —Staff writer Beryl C.D.

First, Naples had heaping piles of trash stacked so high that the only way to make way for more trash was to light the piles on fire. Now, with the American release of “Gomorrah,” the international spotlight is on the city’s drug trafficking and gang violence. Naples has had no shortage of negative publicity in the international press, but there is one benefit: people are finally becoming aware of the Camorra. “Gomorrah”—the latest film from Italian director Matteo Garrone—observes the pervasive influence of the Camorra, or mafia clans, in the city of Naples, Italy. Released in Italy last May and winner of the Grand Prix award at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, the film is only now making its way stateside. Garrone has presented a documentary as a visceral and brutally realistic drama, chronicling the life and times of Southern Italy’s infamous underworld. Fittingly, the film’s origins are not without controversy: Roberto Saviano, the author of the original novel “Gomorra,” had a contract put on his head by the Camorra and currently lives under the Italian government’s police protection.Garrone takes us inside five fictionalized stories of ordinary people whose lives and professions are attached to the city’s far-reaching organized crime problems. There’s Totò, the boy who hides a gun and bag of drugs during a police raid and is rewarded with initiation into a local gang, only to be sucked into the violence of neighborhood gang warfare. Franco is a waste management official who oversees the Camorra’s side business of illegally dumping toxic waste, poisoning the local farmland. And there’s Pasquale, the tailor who incurs the wrath of the Camorra when he helps a Chinese clothing sweatshop owner competing with mafia business. In the vein of “21 Grams” and “Syriana,” the film is organized in the hyperlink cinematic fashion, and the connections between each character are never directly made. But these individuals are all tiny pieces ensnared in the Camorra’s tentacle-like grip over society. Although the characters never mention the name of the Camorra, its shadow hangs over every facet of life in Naples. It provides work when unemployment is everywhere, attaches itself to legitimate businesses, and establishes its presence as the de facto source of power and authority through murder and intimidation. Although this movie is about Italian crime syndicates, this is no modern rendition with glorifying elements like “The Godfather” or even “Goodfellas.” Visually speaking, the movie is bleak and almost completely devoid of entertainment for entertainment’s sake. Many of the movie’s scenes take place in the bombed-out public housing high rises within the city’s notorious suburbs, where drug dealers openly conduct business and warfare even when the cameras have stopped rolling. While the context of the movie is probably a little removed from American audiences, the plots are fairly straightforward and not overly reliant upon dialogue or character development. We never learn much about our characters’ backgrounds beyond their immediate relationship with the Camorra—but then again, the Camorra is the main character. Often these characters have typical anti-hero qualities, participating willingly in the mafia’s various profit-making activities. But the film is sympathetic to their stories, humanizing their fears and desperation, especially when sudden cracks of gunfire rip through the thin veneer of stability defining their existence. It impresses upon the audience that, despite its ugliness, this is the only life these characters are offered. The movie is not without its faults. The pacing of the film is slightly tedious, as its tangled subplots can be somewhat slow at times. And because it deals with a highly specific language and setting, the film may be less comprehensible as an international release. One fact of which foreign audiences may not be aware is that most of the movie’s dialogue is in Neapolitan, not Italian. Less a dialect and more a distinct language with its own vocabulary and a noticeably harsher accent, the city’s linguistic diversity highlights a central division between wealthy and poor, Neapolitan and non-Neapolitan. This is especially important given that the main agent for change, the Italian government, has been unable to effectively combat crime or win allies in the extremely insular Neapolitan society. However, these are minor gripes. The movie’s themes—poverty, drugs, gang violence, immigration, pollution—are endemic in western society. If you do a bit of pre-viewing research into the current condition of Naples, “Gomorrah” rewards you with a cinematic experience that is chilling in its reality. —Staff writer Alec E.

Straddling the line between industry and art (and doing neither that well), “Two Lovers,” James Gray’s latest film about wayward souls in Brooklyn, gives an unexpected ladies’ man a set of choices. Good girl versus crazy girl. Cute Jewish girl versus pill-popping ADHD club chick.  Business partner’s daughter (will buy you leather gloves) versus hot neighbor (miscarriage-prone). Sex in his parents’ apartment after 90 seconds of small talk versus sex against a brick wall outdoors in November. Vinessa Shaw versus Gwyneth Paltrow. If only all of us were faced with such difficult decisions.Leonard Kraditor (a mumbling, grumbling Joaquin Phoenix, who apparently walked right off the set and onto “Late Night”) starts off as a mopey loser living at home after a breakup with his fiancée. Presumably, he has bipolar disorder, but his ups and downs seem decidedly normal for someone who has two beautiful women suddenly walk into his life and, at night, goes home to boringly stereotypical old-world Jewish parents, Reuben (Moni Moshonov) and Ruth (Isabella Rossellini).Gray’s typical Brighton Beach setting—2007’s “We Own the Night” and his 1994 debut “Little Odessa” were set there—seems bleaker than ever, a halfway house for Manhattan mistresses like Michelle (Paltrow, in a truly fearless performance) while still grudgingly remaining a home for daughters of Jewish businessmen. Sandra Cohen (Shaw, sporting the latest from the Jennifer Garner line of cheekbone implants)—the daughter of one of Brooklyn’s famed dry cleaning éminence grises—relentlessly hits on Leonard while he pursues Michelle. “I love you,” he tells Michelle, with a stare that could turn Glenn Close to stone. “I didn’t think I’d ever love anyone again. But I do. I love you.”Like “We Own the Night,” “Two Lovers” sees Phoenix moping around Brighton Beach, spouting bad lines. Similarly, there’s also some very inventive sound editing; in the opening scene, where Leonard throws himself into Sheepshead Bay, the ambient noise fades out and we’re surrounded by dull, claustrophobic thumps, richly evocative of Leonard’s mental walls as well as the physical ones of his parents’ apartment. (Gray pulls the same trick during a rain-soaked car chase scene in “We Own the Night.”)Unlike his marginally superior previous effort, which made no bones about being a police thriller, “Two Lovers” suffers from a general languor borne of Leonard’s lack of purpose and lack of definition. He has a mild speech impediment (which sounds exactly like Phoenix’s inebriated Johnny Cash), yet can pull out dance moves no white man has possessed since the late 70s. He effortlessly seduces two beautiful women, but is gawky around his parents’ friends (especially Sandra’s father, a cookie-cutter Jewish stereotype). He’s bipolar, but rarely shows any emotion, be it depression, elation, or anything in between.Gray uses Leonard’s bipolarity and Michelle’s ADHD as an excuse to write bad dialogue (Leonard to Michelle: “He left you. I’d never do that. I’d take care of you. Because that’s what you deserve. You deserve to be loved”). He has no excuse for Sandra, though, who professes to Leonard over chocolate pudding, “I want to take care of you. I feel like I understand you. You’re different. You don’t pretend to be something you’re not. You don’t have to worry about anything. Don’t have to be embarrassed.” And then Leonard responds (I am not making this up): “You know, I’ve got a lot of stuff going on right now. I don’t even know what it’s like to be myself right now.”Ditto, Lenny. He’s a dirtbag for leading both Sandra and Michelle on like he does while expecting us to sympathize when he broods like some character out of an artsy feel-bad movie (Darren Aronofsky’s “Requiem for a Dream” and “The Fountain” being the prime offenders). The “Match Point”-esque ending is designed to be a carnival of conflicted pathos—Woody Allen’s romantic anxieties shot through with Martin Scorsese’s manly poetics—but Gray’s attempt to be an auteur of enclosed spaces and private struggles is mired by bad scriptwriting filled with well-worn tropes of romantic drama. He should embrace his Hollywood side, and it actually looks like he might: his next project is a Paramount thriller starring Brad Pitt called “The Lost City of Z.”—Staff writer Kyle L.K.

At Harvard, time and space are precious commodities. Nearly every student longs for one more minute on an exam, one more foot of space on the morning shuttle. “The Space Within; The Time Without,” the newest exhibition in the Penthouse Coffee Bar at the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH), explores the interchangeability of space and time. Unlike the standard fare of sterile modern sculpture, the SOCH’s latest spatial installation necessitates interaction with the art in a thought-provoking way. The work itself extends not only into the physical space of its gallery but also into the personal space of the viewer.“The Space Within; The Time Without” is the brainchild of Xinran Yuan ’10, who is also a Crimson photographer, and Trevor J. Martin ’10. The two artists first conceptualized the installation in VES 130r: Shapeshifting, a directed studio course. Yuan and Martin created the exhibition after SOCH Art Gallery Curator O. Akili Tommasino ’10 approached them about installing site-specific pieces for the SOCH. “Trevor and Xinran are very sharp conceptual artists,” wrote Tommasino in an email. “My role in curating the exhibition was less about selecting from a pre-existing body of works and more concerned with facilitating the artists’ engagement with the space to create an original installation,” For Yuan, there exists an intimate relationship between physical space and the “space” that contains an individual’s memories, intuition, and emotions. “I think sensitivity to surrounding environment is crucial to making art as well as making impactful art,” she wrote in an e-mail. Yuan cites her well-established interest in architecture as a significant influence on the creation of the exhibition. “[It’s] the fact that a change in routine space, or a moment of disruption, can remind us the otherwise-overlooked surrounding environment,” Yuan said. “That’s why I did a space installation.”Yuan used black yarn to create dark silhouettes of chairs, offset by a white canvas. The organic nature and familiarity of the yarn evokes an intimate nostalgia. Hugging Yuan’s work—literally, as the two elements are joined by black tape—is a clock and picture frames created by Martin. The clock’s face is marked by linear strokes radiating outwards from the center. The rectangular picture frame hangs freely in the middle of the room. A piece of prose excerpted from a text about the events of September 11, 2001 creates the illusion of three-dimensionality with the prismatic shape the words take. At a cursory glance, the piece is striking primarily in its aesthetic appeal; however, the content’s nature lends it a haunting and jarring quality.The latent energy of the exhibition arises from the details of Yuan and Martin’s installation. From the diction and graphic composition of the prismatic prose piece to the linear marks on the clock’s face, each element of the exhibition is fastidious but not overbearingly so. There is a fine line between being finicky and being cerebral, and the artists tread this divide very carefully. One more spool of yarn or one more stroke on the clock-face, and the additions would have been a bit too deliberate.Though the installation is thoughtfully complex and utilizes its environment effectively, the separate components of the installation are not clearly demarcated. The lack of a traditionally defined area for the art divorces the work from its audience, who very easily could overlook parts of the installation. The ebony clock frame, for instance, hangs quietly on the wall; despite the small “time without” label beneath it, the clock melds with the space around it. As a result, the clock is ambivalently camouflaged as part of the café’s stock décor. However, the tension that such an arrangement creates between its own passivity and the installation’s demand for intellectual attention does not necessarily weaken the impact of the exhibition.As a work concerned with space and intuitive sensitivity, the installation succeeds in seamlessly fusing its fictional space within the real physical space of the gallery. Such subtlety may very well be a sacrifice worth making to carry out the art’s intent.“The Space Within; The Time Without,” on view through April 3, calls for observation, perception, and deliberation. To directly address the exhibition, which passively defies confrontation by retreating into the background, is to uncover a metaphysical wonderland.

Rockus is upon us. Harvard’s only student-run record label (Veritas Records) and Rolling Stone Collection sponsored Battle of the Bands, Rockus, has been rocking the Loft at Tommy Doyle’s for the last three weekends, replete with all the great wah-wah leaden guitar solos and terrible college band names you could dream of (The Sound of Growing Up, Sex!, Francis & the Lost Marbles). This past Saturday though, it was Harvard’s turn; BC, BU, Berklee, MIT, Emerson, and Tufts had already staked their claim and chosen one band apiece to send to the final round set for April 14 at Paradise Rock Club near BU in Boston. There, the winners of each prelim will compete for the ultimate prize: their name in Rolling Stone magazine and on RollingStone.com, a three-track EP recording session at a top studio in New York, and a cash prize. The stage was set, the Loft packed with a sold-out crowd of low-top Nike Dunk SB’s (and five pairs of parents’ penny loafers). Tommy Doyle’s great upstairs venue was well-lit with a low-slanted cabin ceiling, a small but very visible stage, and good sound. In fact, despite the weirdly-placed U2 Elevation tour poster hanging right above the lead singer’s head, there’s hardly another venue in the Square better suited for this kind of show. Veritas Records CEO Caitlin V. Crump ’10 kicked things off by explaining the prizes and the grading system that would be used by the judges—an expert panel of roommates, a former head of Veritas Records, and some guy from MIT. Each band would be “graded based on sound, performance, and lastly but certainly not least, crowd reaction.” And with that she introduced the first band, Elephantom, who drew a big round of applause before even playing a note. There were clearly some friends in the crowd, but the band quickly showed that the applause was well deserved with a thumping opening song.Best defined as a jazz-rock fusion group with jam-band leanings, Elephantom were pretty much a great “Battle of the Bands” band. It was pretty evident, though, that each of the instrumentalists (trumpet, guitar, keys, and bass) had talent with a special emphasis on the skills of drummer Nick Pope, and the cute lead singer didn’t hurt their chances, even if the PA made her a little hard to hear. Four songs kept the crowd skanking—that knees bent, head-bobbing, white people dance that looks cool when girls do it but really stupid when guys do it, and even started some crowd surfing which amusingly ended in someone’s mom getting kicked in the head. A crowd chant after their last song made Elephantom early favorites.Next up was Disband, or Shy October, or Caitria O’Neill; a pre-show name change confused the Tommy Doyle’s staff, but for continuity’s sake let’s just call them Kathleen Turner Overdrive.The viola and acoustics outfit brought a slower, softer, Ingrid Michaelson sound to the stage that was well received, but ultimately too calm to retain attention. Until they nail down their sound, they would do much better in a coffeeshop setting, but for a band that was put together just for this show, they definitely put out something enjoyable.Seasoned vets the Ben Kultgen Band were third in the lineup, and though I’m not sure how a band without any current Harvard students were allowed in the contest, these guys were definitely the most polished of the four competing groups. Also the only straightforward two guitars, bass, and drums rock outfit in the battle, the Ben Kultgen Band threw down some solid pop-rock. Three songs that would be prime for rotation on any adult-alternative radio station were it not for some heavy metal-inspired guitar work, were by far the tightest, cleanest songs of the night. They did a great job getting the crowd into it, seemingly dedicating every song to the ladies, and even the other bands could be seen dancing in the crowd, appreciative of their performance. Their last song was the only cover of the night, and would prove to be the show stealer, as Kultgen’s sweater came off and sunglasses came on and the band launched into a well-crafted version of Britney Spears’ “...Baby One More Time.” Taking the stage last was Start, Go!, who also put out a fairly tight performance with their brand of Dashboard Confessional rock. General pop-punk gave way to one or two good slow burners. The five song set was highlighted by their new track “Cut Like a Knife” which showed a lot of promise, but a between-song MySpace plug seemed to turn off a few crowd members. It wasn’t really clear which of the band members were Harvard students as they definitely had an older look. Also of note was the lead guitarist’s hilarious Michael Jordan tongue wag solo face. In the end, Kultgen and co. took home the bacon, and can look forward to carrying The Crimson to Paradise Rock Club. After a string of sold-out round one shows, fans will now have to wait until the final competition in April to determine which college band can best sell their sound in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
America’s Walking City is primed to become America’s Biking City. In an exciting announcement on Tuesday, top Boston officials unveiled plans for a citywide bike-sharing program similar to Paris’s famous Vélib’. The plan eventually calls for 6,000 communal bikes to be stationed at 600 public racks around Boston; anyone with a bike card can swipe in to unlock a bike, ride it as long as he or she chooses, and return it to any rack in the city. 
This is nothing short of a phenomenal development. Students and locals alike should be ecstatic to see Boston taking real steps toward an initiative that will both improve our daily lives and have a tangible impact on environmental responsibility. 
It is such a worthy ambition, in fact, that Harvard plans to start its own version, VeriFAST Cycles, this year. The Environmental Action Committee is targeting Earth Day, less than two months away, to debut bike-sharing racks in two houses. For long commutes from the Quad or to distant classrooms, we eagerly anticipate bike-sharing at Harvard as well.
A good amount of our euphoria comes from bicycles’ perfect compatibility with a green lifestyle. Boston’s bike-sharing system is expected to replace 315,000 car trips per year, amounting to 750 tons of greenhouse emissions. In addition to making a real difference in pollution levels, however, over 6,000 additional bikes on the road would also change the way Bostonians think about the environment. As car commutes fall out of fashion, so will other energy-wasting activities, similar to the contagion of sustainability on the Harvard campus. To this end, Boston would do well to take an even closer look at its transportation system for further ways to diminish its carbon footprint.
The bike-share should branch out from Boston proper—certainly into Cambridge, but also into the closest suburbs, such as Newton. The farther the program’s reach, the more minds it will change, and the more car trips it will save. It will also do wonders to relieve congestion on Boston’s infamously crowded crosstown arteries and non-square squares.
As students without cars, however, we are also excited about the convenience of both bike-sharing plans. With a faster mode of transportation than walking that doesn’t come with the cost or hassle of the MBTA, our universes are sure to expand. We hope that trips to the Quad, Porter, or Central will become more like second nature, and Boston less like an odyssey. Finally, cycling is an excellent activity not just for the environment, but for our health as well. We are thrilled that something concrete is being done to encourage the hobby. 
The only possible hitch in the plan is Boston itself. A small city with manic drivers and harsh winter weather surely would not be kind to bikers. But we see no reason that this mindset cannot change with the environmental one. First, critics overestimate the problem of winter. Montreal, with a much colder and snowier climate than ours, is one of North America’s most bike-friendly cities, and its Vélo Québec was the first bike-sharing program on the continent. 
In addition, Boston’s own bike-share would compel the city to be more supportive of two-wheelers. Currently, Boston may not have much of a cycling infrastructure, but this could and should change anyway. To encourage the good habit of biking, Boston should install more bike lanes and leave cyclists their own spaces. In turn, our streets would become safer for bikers, encouraging even more people to join their ranks.
There are few things that carry more intrinsic good than a bike ride. Bike skeptics truly underestimate the simple pleasure of riding down the banks of the Charles on the first warm day of the spring—and the knowledge that you are frolicking entirely carbon-free. The Boston and Harvard bike-shares can make this a reality, sooner rather than later. We don’t just applaud these new initiatives; we give them a standing ovation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations! You’ve gotten into Harvard. But if you think that the barrages of “good luck,” “make us proud,” and other proverbial pats on the back will end once you step on campus, think again.
Even before students uncap their pens for their first lecture; they are force-fed more praise than they know what to do with. At one of last year’s orientation talks for freshmen, a resident dean opened by saying, “You all wanted to get into a good school, and you’ve done that.” Amid the raucous laughter that followed, the dean added, “You’ve all made it to a pretty good school.” More laughter ensued.
While this small self-promoting joke may seem harmless, it is an example of the kind of sentiment all too commonly expressed at Harvard. Depressingly, this type of proverbial back-patting makes it past ceremonious occasions like Commencement, filtering into the daily life of the classroom. It is these locutions that are largely responsible for the oft-complained of arrogance of Harvard students.
Just this week, a professor told everyone in a fairly large class that we are already in the 99.9th percentile of people in the world who understand our specific area of content. Disregarding the notion of there being any validity in this odd quantification of our studies, or the fact that we’re less than a month into the semester, peddling notions of our superiority in this way can only amplify the belief that we are smarter than anyone lacking the Harvard name.
It’s true that educational theory often recommends that teachers use encouragement and goal-setting to inspire students to greater achievement. Merely massaging their egos does just the opposite, however, legitimizing their spot at the top and extinguishing any motivation to move forward.
Reaching an institution like Harvard does not mean you have “made it,” and this thought pattern will only bring you further from ever actually making it. Those who already buy into the seemingly kind words of their professors or the visitors who envy them are smothering the very impetus that got them to Harvard in the first place. During the four-year period students are here, they should work to be as humble and willing to gain academically from others as possible.
It is ironic that a faculty that promotes collaboration and cross discipline communication so often tells students how much they do know, instead of teaching them what they don’t. This mentality only douses the incentive to learn from others, creating students without humility and perpetuating insular behavior and close-mindedness.
Harvard students’ heads are already enlarged enough thanks to magazine ranking systems, the flashing cameras of tourists, and the words of friends and family. Harvard may be a good school, and its students may be pretty smart, but, professors, please—they don’t always need to know it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Lent, I gave up going to church. It’s been a sacrifice. Now, when Sunday rolls around, I no longer feel the delightful pangs of guilt that used to follow me from meeting to meeting. In the company of friends who showed up last Wednesday at dinner with dark smudges on their foreheads, I had to slink around shamefacedly, muttering something about how I’d thought the service was at 4:30. But I wasn’t alone. The response of most of my friends when I posed the question “What are you giving up for Lent?” was “It’s Lent already?,” “What’s Lent?,” or “I’m Jewish.” Or “Fish.” 
Harvard has changed. When it began, it consisted of nine men preparing for lives of contemplation and self-denial in the Protestant ministry. Now, it consists of 6,700 undergraduate men and women preparing for lives of contemplation and self-denial in the current economy.  With the demise of the Reason and Faith requirement in the new General Education system, religion at Harvard seems to have completed its trajectory from prime focus of the classroom to just another extracurricular activity. On the Harvard website, “Religious Groups” inhabit a drop-down menu of activities cheek-by-jowl with “Academic & Pre-Professional,” “Arts and Performance,” “Athletics & Recreation,” “Media & Publications,” and “Public Service.” Being a person of faith is just another of a wide range of fun activities available to those who come to Harvard. When Harvard boasts to admitted students of its more than 40 religious groups, it does so in the same vein that it boasts of its nearly dozen a cappella groups. The message is clear enough: Religion, like vocal arrangements of pop hits, is something to practice on your own time.
But should things be this way?
Cult-like as my extracurricular pursuits tend to be—we wear matching hoodies, make annual pilgrimages, and spend a lot of time in nonsense chanting—I understand that they are not going to provide me with answers to the big philosophical questions. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals doesn’t know why we have toes or where HUDS gets all that squash.
I would go on about how religion shapes all major international debates and conflicts, but I have never had to take a course about it, so I am not certain how it shapes the conflicts. I just have a vague, uneasy feeling that it does and that I am not being sufficiently prepared to engage with its role in the world. 
As I see some of my peers getting pumped for Purim, others giving up chicken for Lent, and others conscientiously forswearing any form of belief, I cannot help wishing that Harvard provided us the opportunity to engage with the complex fabric of religious belief both inside and outside the classroom. Harvard is a wondrously tolerant climate for debate and exchange among a wide variety of thoughts, backgrounds, and beliefs, but the voice of religion on campus is largely inaudible. In fact, if there were no food involved, it might be completely silent. Nearly everything faith-related that I have done at Harvard has been followed by free food, from going to services at Harvard’s Episcopal Chaplaincy to attending a day of interfaith discussion and dialogue hosted by the university chaplains in the fall. And that was exciting! After a fast-breaking for Ramadan, there were performances by Jewish and Christian musical groups, a humanist singing a song about the evolution of empathy, and a keynote address by Sally Quinn. The tent outside the Science Center was full of people hungry for discussion and for the free catered dinner. Harvard pulsates with life and thought of all kinds, and religion should not be left out of its ongoing discussions.
Indeed, even the people who in 2006 decided against including Reason and Faith in the Gen Ed requirements did so not because they did not consider religion worth studying, but because they felt that “courses dealing with religion—both those examining normative reasoning in a religious context and those engaging in a descriptive examination of the roles that religion plays today and has historically played—can be readily accommodated in other categories.” Harvard students are famous for allowing certain categories of learning outside their comfort zones to slip into obscurity—witness English concentrators filing into “The Magic of Numbers”—but this should not happen to religion.
In a culture that regards everything as either classwork or extra-curricular activity, religion has become just another extra-curricular, one that sometimes conflicts with fly-fishing club. But you could rise through the ranks to become president of that fly-fishing club, and “attended church” looks funny on your resume. This is why it is critical that Harvard students get the chance to engage with religion inside the classroom as well as beyond. Otherwise, faith runs the risk of becoming just like Memorial Church—something that’s clearly there at Harvard but most students are too busy to look into.Alexandra A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First it was a “credit crunch,” then it was an “economic crisis,” and now a “global economic downturn.” But, with Japan in recession, Europe in recession, and the U.S. in recession, it is high time we face our fears: We are living through a global recession. Still, the worst may be yet to come—if policymakers continue to push for short-sighted economic nationalism, they will make sure this becomes the worst bogeyman of them all: a global depression.
In the past weeks and months, governments around the world have been attempting to fight the economic crisis with monetary and fiscal measures. On the monetary side, even prudish authorities like the European Central Bank have joined the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in slashing interest rates to create incentives for lending and borrowing. Amidst what started as a credit crunch, this was an essential step toward keeping economies afloat when trust suddenly evaporated not only for risky assets, but also for credit-worthy corporations. 
On the fiscal side, most countries are rushing to pass stimulus bills to prevent the phantom of deflation from materializing itself: From developed countries like Germany to developing nations such as India and China, everyone seems to be doing it. By far the most publicized attempt has been President Obama’s euphemistically named American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which flew through Congress a couple of weeks ago. But in measures like these hides perhaps the most pervasive economic threat to future global stability and prosperity: economic nationalism.
Sometimes these protectionist clauses are not included in the original bills sent by executives to a country’s legislatures—and yet they creep in, in the form of amendments and edits. In America, for instance, the incoming Obama administration was so keen on passing the ARRA around Valentine’s Day that the final version of the bill got passed in PDF format; not all legislators had a final version of the 700-page document they were passing, which, as it turns out, will help create a federal deficit this year that would be the world’s ninth largest GDP in the world if it were a country.
Perhaps this explains how the ARRA now includes a “Buy American” clause, which stipulates that all steel and manufactured goods produced with stimulus money will have to be made in America. The bill also makes it practically impossible for any company receiving federal funds to hire foreign labor, no matter how skilled. 
But protectionism does not creep into measures to fight the global downturn only because of the haste with which they fly through legislatures. Even in the 21st century, there are people who actually believe that “Buy American” clauses are a worthy cause. When asked by the New York Times if people would oppose protectionism, Senator Sherrod Brown (D - Ohio) replied: “Who could be against it? Well, some Ivy League economists don’t like it—something about Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression.”
With all due respect, the senator should know better. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, perhaps the best-known protectionist law in history, erected tariff barriers for over 20,000 products after the Wall Street crash in 1929. It may have gotten the lawmakers that passed it reelected, given the short-term boost in domestic demand, but it was a cataclysmic event for the global economy in the medium and long run: Countries soon became entangled in a protectionist race and subsequent trade war that caused American foreign trade (imports and exports) to almost halve. According to Milton Friedman, it created a perfect storm that turned a severe contraction into a depression of global proportions that only ended through world war.
And, as it turns out, America is not the only country turning to protectionist barriers. In a similar vein, French policymakers have included protectionist measures in their stimulus bill, though European Union complaints have made them temper their proposals. Furthermore, for all his talk of avoiding economic nationalism in his speech to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has called for “British jobs for British workers.” Though the rhetoric of short-term political gain is attractive, it is definitely detrimental for everyone playing the game. Economic nationalism gives rise to a prisoner’s dilemma in which the worst possible outcome prevails. If the 1930s are any sign, this short-sighted approach leads directly to further contraction of economic activity. And we know what that is called.
A global depression is not only terrible for its economic consequences—which are pretty bad indeed—but also for its socio-political effects. When poverty, unemployment, and hunger morph into fear, nationalism, and ethnic conflict, much more than our global financial system will be tested. Through protectionism, a matter of butter can quite easily become one of guns.

Who would be brash enough to host a Bernie Madoff Appreciation Dinner? The members of Friday Night Lights, a group founded by Tobias S. Stein ’11 to enliven the celebration of Judaism, did just that. “The people who we are looking to come to our events are the sort of people who would think that was funny,” Stein says. “We try to be funny, and clever, and creative.” Although the organization is now affiliated with Harvard Hillel, it began independently in November 2007 when a group of freshmen decided that Harvard needed a less traditional way for Jewish students to come together. “The way that they have Shabbat dinners at Hillel wasn’t really doing it for me,”  says Stein, who is also on The Crimson’s Business Board. “We wanted to host our own thing and try our hand at it.” While in some respects, the independence of Friday Night Lights could be viewed as a criticism of Hillel, Rebecca D. Gillette ’10, Hillel’s Undergraduate President, doesn’t see it that way. “It’s a really cool alternative route of reaching people...who maybe aren’t naturally brought into Hillel,” Gillette says. According to Gillete, Hillel regularly hosts between 150 and 200 people at its Shabbat dinners, but Stein estimates that Friday Night Lights consistently hosts 50 or more students. Non-Jews are also welcome and members are encouraged to bring their friends and blockmates.  “The average member is someone who is going to come to dinner before they go out,” Stein says. But not everyone is buying in. For example, Jordan D. Feldman ’11 claims he would only attend if his “friends were on board.”But Stein hesitates to say that Friday Night Lights attracts “cooler” members than Hillel, instead choosing to describe it as a distinct niche. “It’s a different crowd, definitely,” he admits.

Welcome to March, arguably the best month for sports.Why do I say that? Four letters: N-C-A-A.Yep, the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament is probably my favorite sports event of the whole year, perhaps only rivaled by baseball playoffs in October when the Cardinals are involved (2006 yeah yeah!) Take a look at it: four days a week filled with games for 10-12 hours, then 12 more games over four days the next week to the reach the Final Four, capped off with two of the biggest days in sports. Delicious. But what really makes the tourney reach sporting Nirvana is the bracket. Filling out a bracket for the tournament gives fans a rooting interest for every game. Do games such as Creighton—Florida or Indiana—San Diego State sound interesting? They do when you’ve picked one of those teams to win.I would guess a fair majority of people in the country have filled out at least one bracket (to the percent that hasn’t: you haven’t lived yet). It’s a beautiful community thing for anyone to talk about. Hopefully, two weeks from now, when people want to start conversations they’ll ask “who is in your Final Four?” instead of “are you writing a thesis?” or “what are you doing next year?”Yes, the bracket is crucial. Last spring I was on a long travel break when the tournament came out, but I still managed to fill out my picks in 15 minutes in the computer room of a St. Petersburg hotel. And I still got half the Final Four right (par for my course).For me, the tournament is not about the money. I’ve filled out brackets every year since 2001, but only in the first three years of high school did I enter large pools with several hundred dollars at stake. With odds so small, I won nothing. What keeps me away from those now is the thought of who could win. You know, the urban legends of people picking teams based on uniform colors or mascots or how attractive the coach is AND THEN WINNING! The thought of my money in a game that is supposed to test one’s knowledge of the game going to people who can’t tell the Big Ten from the Freshman 15 or the Elite Eight from ménage a trois is revolting.Not betting does nothing to diminish my interest though. If anything, my excitement for the NCAA tournament has gone up, thanks to one of the greatest inventions of recent memory: March Madness On Demand. Since freshman year I’ve been able to get nearly all the games live on my computer and can switch between them at will. The CBS toy also works around the world, as I pleasantly discovered while abroad last spring. The travesty that European bars don’t ever tend to show tournament games is negated. Watching Final Four and Championship games that start at two or three in the morning was no problem. And easily worth it. Thanks CBS!Two weeks from today, the euphoric event begins again. I will fill out my bracket hoping to make the correct pick for all 63 games, a hope likely to die in one of the very first games. I’ve had some moderate success in the past, getting two champions right (UConn 2004, Florida 2007) and I won a bag of candy I don’t like in my Expos class pool freshman year on the strength of six Elite Eights, two Final Fours, and UCLA in the title game. Oh yeah, I also picked Maryland to win the women’s tournament, a tournament of which I watched a grand total of zero games.Then there were not so good times, like 2003 when I got zero Final Four teams, or that one day in the first round in 2005 when I watched TWO Final Four picks lose in big upsets. My feelings as I watched Syracuse stink it up against Vermont gave new meaning to the term “March Madness.”But the tourney should be a happy time for you and me. While we wait, I’m looking forward to the end of the regular college basketball season, including that of the Harvard team—which I cover for The Crimson—and then the many conference tournaments, a juicy lead-in to the tourney.Watching those games is also great prep for picking winners. There are so many different criteria proposed by experts that they often contradict each other in the end. So go with your gut. Pick teams you root for to win, within reason, while predicting teams you don’t like to lose earlier than expected. (Duke has lost to a lower seed every year since 2004 hahaha).Most importantly, be pumped. This is sports utopia.—Ted Kirby ’09 is a History concentrator in Pforzheimer House. His bracket is better than yours.

As Harvard Hillel’s Web site states, “Speed dating is as Jewish as kugel.” And the ritual has some roots in tradition: in the ’90s, Yaacov Deyo ’85 set up “SpeedDating” events to match up single Jewish men and women in Los Angeles. According to Michael B. Pershan ’11, president of the Harvard Hillel Men’s Club, this year’s Saturday night speed dating at Hillel aimed to “give Jews a chance to meet other Boston-area Jews,” true to Deyo’s vision.
Co-sponsored by the Men’s Club and the Jewish Women’s Group, the event attracted over 100 eager singles from a variety of colleges around Boston.
An overwhelmed Pershan surveyed Hillel’s bustling dining hall. Additional tables and chairs were hastily arranged to accommodate the unexpected turnout as the room quickly filled with students donning name tags, introducing themselves, and munching on Trader Joe’s treats.
“We would have been happy if 30 people showed up,” he says.
Reyzl R. Geselowitz ’10 of the Jewish Women’s Group saw the crowd as a testament to the drab dating scene at Harvard.
“There is a very small number of Harvard couples who are basically married for four years, and everyone else is lonely,” she said. “The outrageous turnout tonight is evidence of that.”
To add to the appeal, the event’s tagline stated: “Make your mother proud.”
“It’s not an exaggeration,” Geselowitz said. “Whenever my parents or grandparents call they ask me ‘So...?’”
Four minutes after everyone had settled in, the peal of a shrill whistle provided the speed daters with another chance to make their parents proud, or perhaps remedy the perpetual singlehood so often induced by Harvard culture. Even a few non-Jews could be found in the mix.
“My parents push me to go out and meet a good Jewish woman,” claimed Anthony J. Sterle ’11. “And I’m not even Jewish.”

Former senior State Department official Paula J. Dobriansky became the most recent senior fellow to join Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center.Dobriansky, who served as under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs under former President George W. Bush, will lead weekly seminars at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. “I’m just very excited, very thrilled to be here,” Dobriansky said.Dobriansky, who earned her Ph.D. in government from Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1991,  will lead a weekly seminar series on transnational issues involving the intersection of governments, businesses, and NGOs. Beginning with a seminar titled “Women as Agents of Change” next Monday, the series is open to undergraduates, as well as KSG students.“Everybody is going to be excited about the seminar series she’s going to put on, particularly the students,” said Mary Crowley, staff assistant to the senior fellows.In addition to the seminar series, Dobriansky plans to conduct research on climate change and diplomacy involving the Arctic and Antarctica, as well as to make herself available to students, particularly those interested in working at the State Department or the National Security Council. “She’s been here for only one day, and I’ve had a lot of students request to meet with her,” said Eric B. Rosenbach, the executive director for research at the Belfer Center.Dobriansky said she hopes to host an Institute of Politics Forum event on the impact of pop culture on foreign policy. She said she plans to invite an “interesting mix of people,” including entertainers, politicians, and diplomats.As under secretary, Dobriansky was also the coordinator for Tibetan issues and the president’s special envoy on Northern Ireland. She will be at the Belfer Center as senior fellow until June.

The dire backdrop of the economic crisis may not seem like the most celebratory theme to use for a self-titled ‘launch party,’ but the Harvard International Review did just that when it released its Winter 2009 issue last night at a soiree in CGIS cafe.  Approximately 40 students gathered for the event, which doubled as a symposium, featuring economics professor Benjamin M. Friedman ’66 as the keynote speaker. Friedman touched on the current trend of corporate layoffs of foreign employees and fielded questions about protectionism, government intervention and China’s rapidly growing economy. “The current economic downturn is extremely threatening,” Friedman said during his speech. “People should be aware that the problems we’re discussing are far more important and lasting than just here in the United States.”   Going beyond quantitative economic analysis, Friedman discussed the ethical implications behind deciding between firing foreign or domestic workers.  “I thought his idea of looking at economics through moral consequences would appeal to a lot of students” said Gabrielle M. Domb ’11, who helped coordinate the launch party. The international publication’s Winter 2009 issue, titled “Rethinking Finance Beyond the Crisis,” aimed to answer a series of looming questions about the sagging global economy through articles by distinguished academics.  Notable contributors include Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council of Foreign Relations, Ellen E. Meade author of Regional Monetary Integration, and Harvard Professor of International Economics Richard N. Cooper.One of the review’s editors, Owen C. Barron ’10, said that the new issue’s overarching goal was to show how the economic crisis extends beyond the borders of the United States. “These articles are just one step forward in reforming the system,” Owen added.   The review’s second launch party of the year, the event was designed to promote the publication within the Harvard community. While the HIR is distributed worldwide, the review has a relatively low profile on campus, said Barron.“We’re really trying to increase our presence on Harvard’s campus,” he said. “It’s a great way to have connections between professors and students on topics of international interests.”The publication has already begun making plans for its spring issue and symposium which will focus on the “Future of War.”

Waterman Award, thinks there might be.Charbonneau is currently working on a project called MEarth, which aims to detect planets that are rocky and warm enough to sustain life—previous research has focused mostly on gaseous planets, because they are usually large and easier to view. The Alan T. Waterman award is specifically targeted to young professionals, requiring that the recipient be under the age of 35, a U.S. citizen, and have had a Ph.D. for fewer than seven years. According to Lisa-Joy Zgorski, the media officer for the National Science Foundation, this award honors “young professionals who have each have achieved great things.”The award will provide Charbonneau with $500,000 over a three-year period.  According to Charbonneau, most traditional research grants need to be approved and often high- risk ideas are not considered, but this award does not have these types of restrictions. He described this kind of gift as one that will give him the opportunity “to do something that’s a little out of the box.” His “out of the box” idea is to develop experiments that could determine if life exists on distant rocky planets. On earth, oxygen presence shows evidence of photosynthesis and hence life—if he were able to find oxygen content on another planet, this could be evidence of life.Christine E. Pulliam, the spokeswoman at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said Charbonneau “is great at taking small grants and making impressive things out of them.”Charbonneau said he was preparing a lecture for one of his undergraduate astronomy classes when he received a call from the National Science Foundation informing him that he had won the award. Charbonneau, who also serves as the director of undergraduate studies for astronomy, teaches a number of classes in addition to his research commitments. This Friday, the NASA Kepler mission—in which Charbonneau is playing a part—is launching with the goal of looking at 100,000 stars to try to find a habitable planet. His specific role in this mission is to see whether the planets are rocky or gaseous, which will be done through calculating the planet’s density.“This is a giant puzzle and he’s putting the pieces together,” Zgorski said. “He is stellar, pun intended.”

In an effort to attract more students and reduce the twelve pages its requirements fill in the student handbook, the Classics department unanimously approved a final draft of a new, more flexible curriculum on Tuesday afternoon, according to the department’s director of undergraduate studies, Mark J. Schiefsky. The new set of requirements no longer includes the department’s unique general exams or its decades-old mandatory reading list, although they remain popular with many students. Its seven tracks of study are being reduced to two—Classical Civilizations and Classical Languages and Literatures. The latter track will require fewer language courses than current language-intensive tracks.Now that a final version has been agreed upon, the proposal will soon be presented to the Educational Policy Committee. Schiefsky, who is also a professor in the department, said that he hopes the curriculum, which was approved in draft form by the department in December, will be approved soon so that much of it can be implemented next year. It is unclear how requirements for current concentrators will be affected, he said.The revisions were designed to improve the concentration’s flexibility and accessibility to students who have not previously studied classical languages, Schiefsky said. He added that he decided to initiate the curricular review last semester because the concentration’s requirements had become incoherent, the general exam system was not working well, and he was encountering students who were discouraged from joining the department because they did not think they could “manage” the curriculum.He said that the changes were not prompted by “a sense of crisis about numbers declining or anything like that,” noting that the department has seen a stable 12 to 20 concentrators per class in recent years.The Classics department joins Harvard’s English and history departments in revising concentration requirements to make them more flexible. The Classics department will continue to require one semester-long sophomore tutorial on classical civilization. It is also reviving a required junior research tutorial that will prepare students to write theses.The two new tracks will require relatively few semesters of languages, which Schiefsky said he hopes will attract more concentrators. Classical civilizations will require four language courses, while classical languages and literatures will require six—down from eight in the current language-focused tracks. The department has gradually been expanding its focus beyond language to increase its emphasis on other fields, like archaeology, history, and philosophy, Schiefsky said.“We don’t intend to stop teaching Greek,” Schiefsky said, “but there are also interesting things you can say about Greek texts even if you don’t know the language. Classics is not something accessible only to those willing to learn Greek for six years.”Professors decided early in the review process to eliminate the general exams and the accompanying mandatory reading list, said Classics junior class representative Veronica R. Koven-Matasy ’10. Schiefsky said the general exams were cut for many reasons, including that they discouraged students from exploring material outside the mainstream and bored faculty who were forced to teach the same texts year after year.“No other Classics department has a general exam for undergraduates,” Schiefsky said. “Our general exams were in effect qualifying exams for Ph.D and M.A. candidates...That’s not what the concentration should be. It should be part of a liberal education.”Many current concentrators said they are sad to see the general exams go. “I’m conflicted about getting rid of generals,” said Koven-Matasy, who has been studying Latin for nearly a decade. “I’m attached to the idea of a very high standard expected of Harvard students, and I like the idea that we have a test.”Scott J. DiGiulio ’09 said that the generals improve the concentration’s social life. “It helps to create a kind of solidarity among seniors,” he said. “We’ve worked towards this thing together for almost two years now, and it’s really helpful to bring us together as a class.”“We recognize the sentiment,” Schiefsky said, “but we also feel very strongly that it is necessary to reach out to students.”—Staff writer Alex M.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School and the Center on Media and Child Health reported on Monday that television has neither a positive nor negative effect on the cognitive development of young children.
Researchers monitored 872 children from birth to three years of age in terms of how many hours they spent in front of a television screen. The findings revealed that children who watched educational programs were no more adept in vocabulary or visual and motor ability tests than those who did not.
“Educational programs are a way of making parents not feel guilty with parking their kid in front of an electronic baby sitter,” said Michael O. Rich, the director of CMCH and associate professor of pediatrics at the Medical School.
According to Rich, only six percent of parents are aware that children under the age of two should not be in front of an electronic screen.
Several of the researchers expressed hope that further research would investigate the effects of television viewing in children older then three years as well as the effects of content matter. 
Previous studies have found that although overall television viewing had no effect on children, watching baby videos specifically had a negative impact on vocabulary.
“Parents must be aware that although the study does not show evidence of harm, there are some indications that TV viewing at high levels can put children at risk of obesity, sleep problems, and attention problems,” said Marie E. Schmidt, the study’s lead author.
Schmidt, a developmental psychologist and instructor of pediatrics at the Medical School and a research associate at CMCH, added that parents should be encouraged to limit their children’s television viewing.
The interface between media and child health is a relatively new area of research, and Elsie M. Taveras, an assistant professor at the Medical School, said there is still more research to be done.
“Parents need to be educated about what is the scientific evidence for ‘educational benefits’ of TV viewing,” Taveras said.
Schmidt added that one study is not enough to reach a conclusion but that the amount of publicity the study has received is evidence that parents are “hungry for this information.”

Senator Charles E. Grassley asked pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Inc., to disclose all financial ties to Harvard Medical School faculty on Tuesday, citing a recent New York Times report that 149 of the school’s faculty members have ties to the company.In a letter addressed to the Pfizer CEO, Grassley—a Republican from Iowa who has been an outspoken critic of conflicts of interest in medical research—gave the company until March 10 to produce a “detailed account” of payments to Medical School faculty since the beginning of 2007.Ray Kerins, a Pfizer spokesperson, told The Crimson yesterday that the company will give Grassley the requested information. He added that the company has already committed to public disclosure of payments to physicians. On Feb. 9, Pfizer announced that it would begin making online postings of donations to physicians in July. “This comes down to making sure that we conduct our business in the most highly ethical and responsible manner possible,” Kerins said.Grassley’s letter also requested a response to allegations by Harvard Medical School students that a Pfizer representative photographed them at a protest they staged against conflicts of interest last fall.  Pfizer has confirmed that a sales representative was at the protest, and that a photograph was taken of Medical School students. Kerins, the Pfizer spokesperson, told The Crimson that the company “regrets that a photograph of Harvard Medical School students was offensive to anyone involved.”At the same time, he said, it was “very unfortunate” that the photograph had overshadowed the importance of collaboration between leading companies such as Pfizer and leading academic medical institutions.David J. Cameron, the Harvard Medical School spokesperson, said that he could not comment on Grassley’s request. Cameron said that he was present at the student protest last fall but did not know anything about the presence of a Pfizer representative at the time.“It was a public event, and people outside HMS were invited in,” he said, adding that “a lot of people there were taking pictures.”Thomas P. Stossel, an HMS professor and long-time proponent of industry in medicine, said that Grassley’s inquiry was “a total waste of time” and an “ongoing publicity stunt.”“[This] isn’t helping medicine or science, and it’s just getting him attention,” Stossel said. He added that he believed Grassley and his allies are on a “witch hunt,” and that he thought doctors with pharmaceutical ties were being subjected to embarrassment they do not deserve.  Stossel was also critical of student complaints about the Pfizer photographer at the protest.  “What do they think, that Pfizer is going to come and hire people to break their legs?” he said. “Our students need to be a little more thick-skinned.” David C. Tian, a first year student at the Medical School who helped organize this fall’s protest, had no comment about Grassley’s request. Two other student protestors also declined to comment on the Senator’s statement yesterday.—Staff writer Laura Mirviss can be reached at lmirviss@fas.harvard.edu.

A new Berkman Center Web site seeks to compile data on web access and censorship around the globe. Herdict.org—whose name is a portmanteau word of “herd” and “verdict”—allows Internet users to record when a Web site appears inaccessible to them. They can also see if other users around the world are experiencing the same problem, creating a real-time database that catalogues and monitors which Web sites are down or restricted.By calling on Internet users to report their experiences, Herdict utilizes a burgeoning internet trend known as “crowdsourcing”—asking large groups of people to perform some task in an open forum. Internet access has become more than just a technical issue in recent years, as the Web has become a portal for political dissent and information dissemination that many governments fear might foment unrest.Authoritarian governments frequently censor Internet access, restricting access to pro-democracy sites and sites for organizations documenting human rights violations. China, for instance, denies access to web pages describing the Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989 and Falun Gong, an outlawed religious group. According to Law School Professor Jonathan L. Zittrain, who conceived of the site, past efforts to monitor web restrictions have been centralized, making it difficult to identify and track the sites that have been blocked in real time. By having Internet users report problems as they occur, Herdict overcomes that issue, he said.Inaccessibility can also come from more innocuous sources than government censorship, said Jillian C. York, a Herdict project coordinator affiliated with the Berkman Center. Workplaces and schools frequently restrict access to certain sites via filters, she said, which might explain why the United States currently leads in documented cases of restricted web access.Certain Web sites also restrict access or content to certain parts of the world, increasing the number of catalogued occurrences of inaccessibility, Zittrain said. YouTube, for example, restricts access in Thailand to videos deemed insulting towards the Thai king, but users in other countries have access to these videos, he said.Knowing which sites are inaccessible is merely the first step in determining restrictions to web access, Herdict coordinators said, since sites frequently go down for technical reasons. By generating data from several different countries and comparing access, Herdict can begin to isolate instances of state censorship.Recently, the Syrian government blocked access to the Arabic version of Wikipedia, said Vandana Aneja, a Herdict  coordinator. By comparing access in several Arabic nations, it became clear that the malfunction was not accidental, but rather government interference with the Internet.Herdict plans to launch Arabic and Chinese-language versions of the Web site to reach users in those parts of the world most affected by government censors, said project coordinators.Since the site depends on user-generated content, Herdict organizers said they are planning to launch a broad publicity campaign. But they also said they have been mindful that their site may fall victim to censorship.The publicity campaign will mainly utilize alternative media outlets in certain countries instead of main-stream media, said Aneja, since larger organizations tend to be a “sure-fire” path to censorship.—Staff writer Elias J.

Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, nicknamed “The Lion of the Senate” during his near half-century in office, has been awarded an honorary knighthood, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced yesterday.Kennedy will become a Knight of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, an award Boston’s British Vice Consul for Political, Press, and Public Affairs Joseph P. W. Pickerill said is “primarily designed for people who have contributed significantly in the realm of public service.”According to Pickerill, Kennedy was selected for the honor on the basis of his efforts to build peace in Northern Ireland, provide better healthcare for Americans, and enhance education opportunities for children. “For me this honor is moving and personal—a reflection not only of my public life, but of things that profoundly matter to me as an individual,” Kennedy said in a statement released by his office.Despite receiving the knighthood, Kennedy will not be granted the title of “Sir,” as he is not a British citizen.Kennedy will also likely receive his award from the British ambassador to the United States, rather than Queen Elizabeth II, who knights only British subjects. A date for the ceremony has not yet been set, Pickerill said. Brown, who is currently visiting the U.S., announced Kennedy’s award during a speech before a Joint Meeting of Congress.  “I hope that you will allow me to single out for special mention today one of your most distinguished Senators, known in every continent and a great friend,” Brown said. Nominations for knighthood are submitted to the British Foreign Office in London, where the British Foreign Secretary reviews the suggestions and makes recommendations to the queen, Pickerill said. Ultimately the queen has the final say as to who will be honored.Kennedy, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor last May, received an honorary degree from Harvard in a special convocation ceremony in December. “On a local level, we’re delighted that the senator from the state we represent is being honored,” Pickerill said.Other notable Americans who have been named honorary knights include former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, author Elie Wiesel, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.

If you thought the rhyming first names of softball captains Hayley Bock and Bailey Vertovez were indicative of similar personalities, you couldn’t be more wrong.Bock’s years behind the plate have developed her into a more vocal and prominent leadership presence on the field. On the other hand, Vertovez has emerged as the team’s primary organizer behind the scenes. “[Vertovez] can be more vocal off the field, and she has a really good sense of the team pulse and how things are going,” Bock says. “I’m a little bit louder on the field. I’m a little bit harsher with the team, as far as yelling or executing things. We work really well together, and what one may lack, the other one makes up for in leadership skills.” But while the two differ in their approaches to the captain’s role, the senior duo ultimately represents two sides of the same coin: they share a desire to recapture the Ivy title and avenge last season’s disappointing loss to Princeton in the league championship series.“Obviously, every year we want to win the Ivy title, so we’ve gone [into the season] thinking that,” Vertovez says. “To lose to [Princeton] in the Ivy championship was just heartbreaking.” The captains will have to find a way to guide their team to the Ivy championship this year without all of the luxuries that come with a large senior class—players used to the rigors of the league and the styles of the coaching staff. The class of 2009 started out as a small group in its freshman year with just four recruits, and only Bock and Vertovez remain. Three years of trial by fire in the Ivy League have honed the duo’s talents into two very different and specific roles on the team, with Bock as starting catcher and Vertovez likely to see time at both shortstop and on the mound this season. “On the field, they’re both experienced players—they know the league,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “They’ve played in the league for three years, they’ve been very experienced working under me for three years. They know the coaches well and communicate well.” Returning as the starting catcher for the fourth year running will be Bock, who was named the team’s Best Defensive Player and an All-Ivy League Second Team pick last year. The senior had caught 22 runners trying to steal a base entering the 2009 season, and Bock gunned down two in the team’s opening tournament against Kansas and North Texas to tie Harvard’s all-time record. “Hayley, she leads kind of by example,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown says. “She’s such a competitor, and...it’s amazing to have her on the field [as a catcher] because she sees everything. She’s a smart player, and she’s awesome to have there.”Unlike Bock, Vertovez has taken a more circuitous route to her captain’s role. Though she was recruited as a pitcher, she has spent most of her collegiate career as a utility starter, getting time at five different positions. In her junior season, Vertovez started all 47 games—mostly at shortstop—but also saw some time on the pitching mound.“Bailey’s awesome,” Brown says. “She’s so friendly and so bubbly. If I have any questions, I can go to her, and she’s just really encouraging. Everything she says, whether it’s constructive criticism or anything, it’s said in a way that is just so helpful. Especially as a freshman, she did a really good job of making me feel like a part of the team.” Bock and Vertovez’s complementary personalities have been vital to the team’s development off the diamond.“They’ve done a great job of creating a very supportive network and good team culture where people feel a part of the group,” Allard says. The captains are ultimately united in their goals for the team this season, and their leadership should prove to be the driving force behind the team’s success. “We play off each other really well, and we’re great friends, which helps a lot—to be able to talk to each other and provide a unified front to the team when we have a problem or something we need to work out,” Vertovez says. —Staff writer Lucy D.

Strength. Balance. Unity.Every class has a set of traits that contributes to the success of a team, but these three hold especially true for the juniors on the Harvard softball team. “We call them the ‘Schmen,’ because there are seven of them, and it was the first time we’ve had seven in a long time, ” co-captain Bailey Vertovez says. “They all work together really well, and they all do different things, so it helps that they can play off each other in that way.”Two years ago, the Schmen began their Crimson careers with a dream season. Led that spring by the budding talent of Lauren Murphy, the 2007 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Harvard captured the Ivy crown by sweeping Penn, 4-0 and 4-2, in the championship series. Ever since then, the Crimson seven has set high expectations for themselves. The following year, they were back in the championship game, but this time around, Harvard fell to Princeton. This didn’t sit quite well with the Schmen, who are seeking redemption this year. “I couldn’t be hungrier for [the title],” Murphy says. “Coming into my freshman season, we won the championship, and that was the best feeling in the world. Last year was the worst feeling, losing to Princeton, and we want victory for sure.”Murphy began her career in the grandest of fashions. Starting at designated player the entire season, she excelled as a slugger. She set the Ivy League home-run record with 18 bombs on the year, led the team with a .350 batting average, and tied the Ivy League single-game homer record with three in the Crimson’s 5-5 effort against Boston College—and all this as a rookie. Her imposing presence instilled caution in opposing pitchers, and led to 16 walks in the final stretch of the season.Murphy continued her superb play in last year’s campaign. However, 2008 marked a transition year. She started all 46 games, but this time around, she split her time between designated player and first base. Under the guidance of Danielle Kerper ’08, Murphy trained for her future role in the infield and solidified her role as the starter at first base this year.“I feel really excited,” Murphy says. “This year I’m going to have more of a leadership role, and that’s something that makes me more of an all-around player.”Murphy isn’t the only starting infielder among the Schmen. Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, enters the season with 89 career starts at third base. She hit .255 and is tied for seventh all-time on the career assist list in the field with 194.“Melissa is the leader,” Vertovez explains. “She will just take charge.”Junior Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, and classmate Jennifer Francis are the starting center and right fielders respectively, and add further depth to the Schmen. They provide the Crimson with stability in the outfield and left-handed bats at the plate, while Jessica Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer, will serve a supporting role to co-captain Hayley Bock behind the plate.“Stephanie’s vocal, very vocal, on and off the field,” Vertovez says. “Jen Fran is also our quiet workhorse...and Jess Pledger is just the happiest one out of all of them. She can just put a smile on your face.”Rounding out the junior corps, pitchers Margaux Black and Dana Roberts will provide further depth to the rotation, though Roberts starts the season recovering from offseason surgery and remains a question mark.“Dana’s a finesse player, so you’ll see her working hard, kind of quiet on the side,” Vertovez says. “Marguax is like our motivator. She’ll encourage people if they’re down and step up when they need her.”Though each junior has found her niche in the lineup, it’s the septet’s contributions off the field that truly makes the class stand out.“The junior class, there are a lot of them, and it’s so funny because each of them brings something completely and totally different to the team,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown adds. “I can’t imagine the team without one of them.”That special bond they share has generated a winning attitude throughout the team, and it will be essential in the Crimson’s quest for a third straight division title and another Ivy League Championship.“It’s great,” Vertovez explains. “Hayley and I can leave the program knowing that this class is going to take over and command the respect of the rest of the team.”

If there was one question heading into this season for the Harvard softball team, it was pitching. After the departure of star Shelly Madick ’08 and her classmate, Amanda Watkins, the mound was the one position on the field where the Crimson didn’t have a seasoned veteran. It seems like that’s a question that’s now been answered. Freshman Rachel Brown got the call in Harvard’s season opener last Saturday against Kansas, and the rookie showed that she’s more than ready to step into Madick’s shoes. Brown pitched two complete games in her first two collegiate starts, giving up a combined eight hits while striking out 21. “Rachel is dominant,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez says. “I would not want to hit against her.” Brown’s no stranger to the circle: the San Diego native has been pitching since she was eight. “I was on a rec team, and they didn’t have any pitching,” Brown says. “My dad was the coach, so he just started me off.” That was the beginning of an impressive youth career that culminated with her setting the single-season San Diego CIF strikeout record and being named Division II Pitcher of the Year in her senior season. In her first few weeks in crimson and white, Brown has already impressed her coaches and teammates with her command of the position. “She has a great rise ball, unbelievable really, and she mixes up everything in her repertoire,” Vertovez says. “It’s very exciting to have her on the mound.” “I love setting the tempo for the game, and being in control,” Brown explains. “It does take technique, but it’s a really mental position and it does take a lot of focus.” The fate of the Crimson’s season rests in part on the shoulders of Brown and her classmates, Julia Moore and Marika Zumbro, as they work to fill the holes left by Madick and Watkins. “I think one of the ingredients of our success this year is going to be our freshman pitchers,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard says. “You’ve got to be strong on the mound to start. [Rachel’s] a very strong, seasoned pitcher.” Brown is certainly up for the challenge. In her second start, she was charged with the task of helping the team rebound from two rough losses. But the rookie performed admirably under pressure. “I just wanted to go out and pitch my game,” she says. “We had a great game against Kansas [in the season opener], and I just wanted to our team to get back to that place and know that we can handle any team. I just wanted to go out there and pitch strikes.” While Brown may have emerged in the season’s first weekend as the pitcher to watch, she is joined on the staff by a wide range of talents. Most notable among them is Vertovez, who is returning to the mound this year after spending much of her Crimson career playing in the field. “I was recruited as a pitcher—I pitched my whole life, ever since I was nine years old,” Vertovez says. “They needed me in the outfield freshman and sophomore years, and last year we didn’t have a shortstop so I assumed that role, but I’m really excited to get back to the mound, to have control of the game. That’s what I loved about it from the beginning.” Most notable about Vertovez, though, is the ease with which she changes roles on the team. In the two games where she didn’t pitch last weekend, she found her way into the lineup as the starting shortstop. “She’s a really versatile player, and every position she plays, she plays really well,” co-captain Hayley Bock says. As a captain, Vertovez has also assumed the responsibility of leading the pitching staff, a job that once belonged to Madick. “[Madick’s] irreplaceable, but getting to that level will be something I’m going to take on myself,” Vertovez explains. “We have three freshman pitchers, so I’m trying to get that attitude, trying to get them to see what it’s like to have that sort of presence in the circle.” Moore and Zumbro were also called upon in their first collegiate weekend. Moore impressed in 2.2 innings of relief work, and though Zumbro endured a rocky start to the season, giving up six runs in two-thirds of an inning, both will be valuable members of the Crimson staff. “[Zumbro] has a great drop ball, which just drops off the table—it’s impossible,” Vertovez says. “And [Moore] throws so hard.” Harvard is also bolstered by two junior pitchers, Dana Roberts, who is recovering from surgery, and Margaux Black. “[Roberts is] a great pitcher—when she’s on, and her arm is healed and all better, she’ll be a good closer,” Vertovez explains. “And [Black’s] a good complement for Rachel and [me], who throw mostly rise balls. We’ll have Margaux come in, who throws mostly drop balls, and throw them off.” But from top to bottom, it’s the Crimson’s depth and talent that will dictate the team’s success this season. “Everyone’s going to be an ace of the staff,” Allard says. “We want to make sure that everybody’s out there and capable of starting a game and going the distance.” —Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
April 14, 2007.
It’s the top of the sixth, and Max Perlman is in control.
Aside from a hit batsman and a pair of seeing-eye singles, Perlman has been flawless on the mound against Yale and holds a 4-0 lead, with Bulldog second baseman Justin Ankney leading off the inning.
After quickly getting ahead in the count, 0-2, the Harvard hurler looks to his best pitch—a nasty changeup—to put Ankney away.
Perlman sets, comes into his windup and tosses a meatball that Ankney deposits over the right field fence.
With his lead cut down to three, and the heart of a powerful Yale lineup coming up, no one would blame Perlman, a rookie, if his confidence were shaken—except maybe Max Perlman.
Not one for excuses, the 6’6 righty welcomes each of the Bulldogs’ 3-4-5 hitters up to the plate and sends each of them back to the bench with—you guessed it—that changeup.
After another perfect inning, Perlman has the win, and the Crimson has an ace in the making.
Now fast forward about two years to the present day. Harvard is set to kick off another season, Perlman is indeed at the top of the rotation, and the Crimson couldn’t be happier.
“It’s important for a team to have its ace pitcher,” Harvard captain Harry Douglas says. “We’re going to feel comfortable when he’s on the mound.”
But Perlman’s journey from promising freshman to the Crimson pitching staff’s go-to guy didn’t exactly work out as smoothly as either the player or team had planned.
At the end of Perlman’s rookie campaign, in which he led Harvard with five wins and a 2.91 ERA, the Longwood, Fla. native found out that coming back in 2008 for his sophomore season would not be an option.
After Perlman committed an undisclosed disciplinary infraction, the College asked him to take a year’s leave of absence. To complicate matters, bone spurs in the pitcher’s elbow would require surgery.
Forced to keep tabs on his team from afar as he rehabbed back home, Perlman watched the Crimson struggle mightily last season. Harvard stumbled through an abysmal 1-22 start, and finished the season 10-30.
“It was certainly tough to sit back and watch them have a bad year and know you can do nothing about it,” Perlman says.
Spurred by an unwillingness to once again stand idly by as his team faltered, Perlman worked tirelessly to ready himself for 2009. After completing rehab last May, he returned to New England to test that readiness on the biggest summer stage in college baseball: the Cape Cod Baseball League.
“Just to be in a league…where just about everybody’s going to play professionally, if not in the major leagues, it’s really pretty humbling,” Perlman says. “I didn’t know what to expect, not having pitched in a year. I didn’t know how my arm was going to respond to surgery.”
Perlman and his arm held up just fine. The lanky hurler made nine starts, going 3-1 with a 3.11 ERA. Perhaps even more telling, he finished tied for second in the league with 55 innings pitched.
Both healthy and effective, Perlman returned to Harvard last fall. A year of separation dissolved in what seemed like an instant.
“It’s like he never left,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh says. “The kid loves this place. He could have gone into a major ACC or SEC program and been in their rotation and he wanted to stay...he got that feeling after one year.”
Perlman did have to deal with a few logistical changes when he returned to Cambridge. Now he rides the Quad shuttle instead of rolling out of bed to make the quick walk across the Yard to class. He’s also switched concentrations from economics to government and sociology (“I couldn’t see myself on Wall Street,” he says). But Perlman’s real adjustment will come on the mound.
While Perlman posted the best numbers in the Harvard rotation his freshman year, former Ivy League Pitcher of the Year Shawn Haviland ’08 was the staff’s unquestioned ace and leader.
With Haviland graduated and making his way through the Oakland Athletics’ farm system, Perlman now bears the responsibility of taking charge of a pitching staff largely comprised of sophomores and freshmen. 
But partly due to the knowledge imparted on him by his predecessor and mostly due to his own quiet confidence, Perlman expresses the willingness to take on a leadership role.
“I don’t really think I feel pressure to fill anyone’s shoes,” Perlman says. “It’s more just pressure to do well and lead by example.”
Haviland, who worked out with the Crimson for part of the preseason, believes he has left the Harvard rotation in good hands.
“[Perlman’s] a real smart kid and a big-time competitor,” Haviland says. “He’s unquestionably the No. 1 on the staff, and guys look up to him. It’s something he looks forward to being.”
As part of Perlman’s development into a true ace, the pitcher is looking to miss more bats this season.
He plans to tinker with his pitch selection and take more risks, in hopes that the flashes of dominance he displayed in his rookie campaign—like in that Yale game, where he struck out eight batters in seven innings—become a recurring theme in his outings this year.
“As a freshman, you want to come out and give your team a chance to win,” Haviland says. “This year, [Perlman]’s two years older and two years stronger.”
Perlman may have a big stage on which to make his return. A high-profile matchup against fellow Cape League alum Ben Tootle, the highly-touted fireballer with a knee-buckling breaking ball, headlines this weekend’s opening series at Jacksonville State. Perlman welcomes the challenge, and, in case there is any doubt about whether the Crimson hurler can go toe-to-toe with Tootle, Walsh provides a telling anecdote.
“One of the scouts,” Walsh begins, “I said to him, ‘How are we going to beat [Tootle]? Can we beat him?’ He says, ‘They’re getting worried about Perlman.’”
If Harvard’s new ace lives up to his potential, the rest of the Ivy League should begin to follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh will have some difficult roster decisions to make this spring, especially when it comes to who’s providing pop in the middle of the order.With strong competition at first base, this power position may create one of the most challenging choices, but junior Andrew Prince is ready to take on the responsibility.The left-handed Bay Area native—a life-long Giants fan—evokes San Francisco’s most famous slugger as a hulking presence with a little swagger. Still, the junior corner infielder has not made the impact he envisioned after two seasons at Harvard. Following an injury-plagued rookie campaign, Prince struggled to find his stroke and his defensive rhythm last year, leaving the junior disappointed.“My freshman year I tore a hip flexor and pulled a hamstring, so I was relegated to swinging,” Prince says. “I don’t think I ever really got back into the swing of things defensively my sophomore year.”Following a 2008 season that saw the Crimson go 10-30—leaving many with a bitter aftertaste—Prince devoted himself tenaciously to sculpting his game, with the hopes of aiding a massive Harvard revival. After spending the summer playing offseason ball in Texas, the junior feels he has made key improvements.“[Texas] was a good opportunity for me to get out and work defensively,” Prince says. “It also gave me a chance to test out some new things at the plate. I found that when I use the whole field, I can be more consistent than I have been just as a pull hitter.”The Crimson will be desperate for such consistency—and perhaps some thunder this year—as Harvard batted just .255 in 2008 and will return no player who hit more than two home runs.With run production looming as a tremendous concern, Prince feels that he is now ready to make the transition into a team leader, as well as a major component of the offense.“If things are going well I think I could be a power bat for the ball club,” Prince says. “Hopefully getting up with guys on base and driving them in.”Using his former pull-happy swing, Prince managed a modest .206 batting average as a sophomore. But, as the lefty has focused on “ironing out” his swing, teammates have begun to notice a difference.“[Prince’s] swing has been looking really good,” Crimson captain Harry Douglas says. “Even when he’s taking swings off a tee, you can see how quick his bat is. He’ll be a nice addition to the lineup.”“He’s been hitting well,” sophomore pitcher Max Perlman adds. “His swing looks like he’s really going to contribute this year.”Despite such votes of confidence from other members of the squad, Prince faces the reality of significant depth at first base and DH. With tough non-conference games ahead, it remains unclear whether or not he will earn a starting spot by the start of the Ivy League season. But regardless of the competition for playing time, the left-handed slugger reveals a pure love of the game that motivates his constant efforts to improve.“I like to get out there and compete, and I like to win,” Prince says. “I don’t know if there’s a much better feeling than...going out there as nine or ten guys on the field and in the lineup and competing against the other nine or ten guys. If you can’t get excited about that, then I don’t know what you can get excited about.”As Prince and all the Crimson veterans recognize, though, there is more at stake for the team than simple enjoyment. While the squad looks to forget a dismal 2008, Prince points to the motivational effect of lingering disappointment.“I’d venture a guess that [last year was] the toughest season that any of us have been through,” he reflects. “This year’s a lot about going out and competing with a chip on our shoulder, remembering how bad that was and not wanting to do it again. I think guys are hungry and ready to play.”If the junior hopes to take part in Harvard’s resurgence, he must first answer some critical questions. Prince’s defense remains unproven in Division I competition, and his refined opposite field approach must translate from the cage to the diamond. Not to mention that no one knows if his recently recuperated hip flexor can weather consistent appearances in the lineup. Nonetheless, Prince demonstrates one quality that he hopes will trump any setbacks: determination.After witnessing his potential when healthy, the junior reveals a single-minded focus to return to form:“I started out my freshman year very well, and I remember that,” he says. “I’ve tasted [success], and I want to get it back...I know I can contribute like that, and I know I can compete and win like that, so I’m just trying to get [that feeling] back.”With the season kicking off today against Jacksonville State, the squad will get a sense of the slugger’s status. If Harvard is lucky, it will get the production it so sorely needs.All Prince is asking for is the chance to prove himself.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tom Stack-Babich doesn’t look like he’d be into yoga.
The batter’s box, not the exercise mat, has been the most comfortable home to Harvard’s 6’3, 210-pound right fielder. But as he worked on staying in shape during his offseason rehabilitation from two 2008 injuries, yoga it would be.
“I actually liked it,” Stack-Babich admits. “I’m not the most likely yoga participant. I was probably the only guy there.”
The yoga experiment may have been Stack-Babich’s most unorthodox strategy in his lengthy rehabilitation from the wrist injury he suffered while stealing a base during the Crimson’s 13-2 loss to Lafayette last March 16. Trying to play through the pain didn’t work, and the cortisone shots Stack-Babich took during the team’s week of games in California didn’t do the trick. The slugger’s season was over, and his long road to recovery was just beginning.
The first step on that road—and perhaps the most painful—was sitting on the bench while his teammates stumbled to a 10-30 overall record, including an 8-12 mark in Ivy play.
“We just kind of got used to losing,” Stack-Babich says of the squad that started the 2008 campaign 1-22. “We couldn’t do the little things. We’ve just got to be good at winning.”
Here’s the kind of season Stack-Babich was putting together before that fateful slide into second base (for the record, he was safe): in 15 games, he amassed a .375 average, 31 total bases, and a .648 slugging percentage after eight of his 18 hits went for extra bases. In one four-game stretch in March, he had 12 hits in 16 plate appearances.
These numbers, when combined with a healthy 2007 campaign that saw him hit .313 and earn an Ivy League Honorable Mention, earned Stack-Babich an invite to the Cape Cod Baseball League, a collegiate summer league that doubles as a breeding ground for future professional players. For the South Shore native, who led Xaverian Brothers High School to a state title in 2004, what began as simply a more pleasant step along the road to recovery quickly became a dream come true—a dream complete with major league scouts checking out prospective draft picks and youngsters asking for autographs. Life was good.
But just as Stack-Babich was beginning to hit his stride on the Cape, another injury forced him to take a big step back. This time—warning: not for the faint of heart—his left thumb folded all the way back during a diving play in the outfield. 
“In practice, I’m a little more conscious about my body and throwing it around,” Stack-Babich admits. “But I’m sure I’ll be diving and sliding like usual once the first game starts.”
These assurances aside, Stack-Babich is letting his preseason workouts do most of the talking—and those watching have gotten the message. 
“He’s a guy I’d like to be a little more like, in the sense that, man, can he drive the ball,” junior slugger Andrew Prince says. “When he’s going well in batting practice, he always starts off hitting the ball solid the other way, just hitting these screaming line drives. He’s a guy that can just be dangerous as hell.”
Returning for a fifth season of athletic eligibility meant that Stack-Babich had to spend the fall away from Harvard and his teammates. After spending that time working at a hedge fund, cooking his own meals, and trying out that whole yoga thing, he’s happy to be swinging the bat again—something he didn’t do for the first time in rehabilitation until late October. What’s more, he’s making up for time lost with his new teammates by becoming a mentor to Harvard’s up-and-comers.  
“[Freshman] Marcus Way was having some trouble with his swing, and Stack just helped him out a little bit,” rookie J.T. 
Tomes says. “You ask him a question, and he’ll always answer it and help you be a better player.”
As the Crimson’s season begins today at Jacksonville State, Harvard will officially put last season’s disaster in the past. The return of a talented sophomore class, which features several 2008 regulars, means another year of experience for a revamped Crimson squad. A promising group of freshmen will fill a few of the gaping holes left by the class of 2008, the biggest of which depleted coach Joe Walsh’s starting rotation. The 2009 opening day lineup looks a lot different from last year’s, but the two have one thing in common: Stack-Babich in the middle of the order, just where his coach likes him. 
“I really think he’s going to have a big season for us—and we need him to,” Walsh says. “I think he’s going to be a kid who will have a chance to play at the next level.”
While he admits he doesn’t have a clear backup plan if professional ball doesn’t pan out, the senior is confident, but not cocky, about his prospects for June’s Major League Baseball draft.
“I think I deserve to get drafted, even though things have been up and down for me,” Stack-Babich says. “Of course I don’t expect to be a high pick, but I don’t care about that. I just want to keep playing baseball.”
Stack-Babich has been in touch with a handful of teams, starting during his Cape League stint and continuing throughout the offseason. They’ll be there this weekend at Jacksonville State, checking out Gamecocks ace and likely first-round pick Ben Tootle. 
But expect them to take a look, too, at the Crimson’s imposing right fielder. If they do, they’ll see the end of one journey—Stack-Babich’s long road back from injury.  And if all goes according to plan, they’ll see the beginning of another—his trip back to his place among the league’s most dangerous sluggers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one wants to see a championship-caliber squad, there is no need to look any further than the Harvard softball team. Winners of the 2008 Ivy League North Division title—and runners-up in the Ivy League Championship Series—the Crimson has a great amount of all-around talent. This year, the players are not willing to settle for second-best like they had to last season. They are ready to go all the way and reclaim their title.“To lose to [Princeton] in the Ivy championship was just heartbreaking,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez says. “Coming out, our opening Ivy games are Cornell and Princeton, at home this time. We’re going to be out for revenge in [the Princeton] game, definitely.”Under the leadership of head coach Jenny Allard and co-captains Hayley Bock and Vertovez, the Crimson will try to continue its success with the same core group of players intact and what promises to be an exceptional freshman class.“It’s an ingredient of success to have strong leadership and veterans, and we have that this year,” Allard says. “We have an influx of very strong freshman talent, and we have a lot of returners who have been starters and major contributors, so that just lends itself to a good, experienced squad.”With the graduation of pitchers Shelly Madick ’08 and Amanda Watkins ’08, Harvard lost two of the best pitchers in its rotation. But this is where the depth of the pitching staff becomes important. With the addition of three new freshmen to the already experienced corps of Vertovez and juniors Margaux Black and Dana Roberts, the rotation looks as solid as ever. “Shelly just had this presence on the mound that was just total domination, and Amanda was just a great motivator,” Vertovez says. “But we’re going to get to that [championship] level, despite losing those two pitchers.”With Danielle Kerper ’08 being the only other graduate, the defensive lineup remains pretty much the same. While Kerper’s presence at first base will be sorely missed, the same group of players that made up the Ivy League’s best defensive team last year is back and ready for business. On the other side, the Crimson offense is led by sophomore Ellen Macadam, who rocked the Ivy League last year, posting a .371 average in her first year of collegiate softball. With 18 stolen bases, she was second in the Ivies only to fellow sophomore Emily Henderson. Henderson was dominant in the leadoff spot, hitting .319 and collecting a program-record 28 steals on her way to an All-Ivy First Team selection.“[The sophomores] are the fastest class we have,” Bock says. “Their speed on the bases will generate runs alone just on stolen bases...With both of them on the bases, we’re going to be unstoppable.”The Crimson opened its season last weekend at the Quality Inn & Suites Invitational in Denton, Texas, where it split with both Kansas and North Texas. Harvard got off on the right foot with a 3-2 walkoff victory in the season opener against the Jayhawks—the team’s first season-opening win since 2005.“We’re ready for more wins,” Vertovez says. “The teams that we played [last weekend]—they beat Arizona and they beat Cal, so they’ve beat some top teams. To come out and show ourselves that we can beat those teams [was exciting].”The Crimson will play in two more pre-conference tournaments before opening its Ivy slate in late March.“This year, we’re going to face some tough teams in preseason,” Allard says. “I felt that last season we played a lot of ranked teams early and overall a tougher preseason schedule. It’s still very tough competition this year, but not as many ranked teams.”Even though Harvard has a challenging schedule to start off the season, it has proven that its early-season record is not necessarily indicative of its play during the rest of the spring. After going 1-9 to start off last season, Harvard dominated in league play to end the season with a 25-22 record. The Crimson’s potent offense will also benefit from the arrival of new hitting coach Brandi Gordon.“She’s changing our swings a lot, but we’re hitting the ball so hard now,” Vertovez says. “It’s really exciting.”And without the pressure of having to defend the Ivy League title, Allard believes that her seasoned squad has the confidence and maturity to control its own destiny.“Our focus this year isn’t necessarily on who we’re playing and what they’re doing—it’s on our game,” the coach says. “We want to face tough competition, and if we lose a game, we want to get beat, not lose it ourselves because we haven’t played to the best of our ability.”Harvard hopes that its unique combination of veteran leadership and young talent will be the right recipe to bring the Ivy title back to Cambridge.“Every year we usually click together, but this year especially...it’s hard to tell who’s a senior and who’s a freshman at this point,” Vertovez says. “We’re adding a bunch of specialty plays, which we wouldn’t have done in past years. We’re bringing our game to the next level.”

The Harvard baseball team may no longer be the preseason favorite to claim the Ivy title and the top spot in the Red Rolfe Division coming into the 2009 campaign, but this scenario may turn out better than expected. The Crimson had been named the team to beat in the Ivy League by Baseball America for three years prior to 2008, but each year, the squad failed to live up to the lofty expectations and clinch the crown. Last season brought no relief, as Harvard posted a dismal 10-30 record after starting the season 1-22. This spring, the Crimson is ready to redeem itself.  “Last year we were pretty complacent, and this year we’ve been working really hard,” captain Harry Douglas says. “We basically learned our lessons from last year, and now we try to move on.” Last season, Harvard suffered from a heavy barrage of injuries early in the season, and playing one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in the country only added to its early woes. Harvard also failed to answer questions regarding the starting lineup, and the Crimson offense posted mediocre numbers as a result. This year, the state of the lineup is more clear-cut. With the benefit of health and consistency, Douglas and senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich could form an imposing 1-2 punch in the middle of the order. Senior left fielder Matt Rogers—when he’s on—provides an enticing package of power and speed, and senior second baseman Taylor Meehan rounds out the veteran leadership.  Less settled is the situation at first base, where there’s a logjam for the second year in a row. Several players are hoping to establish themselves as viable offensive options and win the starting job.“I think we’re going to have veterans in the middle of the lineup that have hit, that have hit for average,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh says. “We’ve got a chance to score some runs, which has been our problem.” The Crimson also has high expectations for a trio of players coming off exceptional rookie seasons. Center fielder Dillon O’Neill, shortstop Sean O’Hara, and catcher Tyler Albright all provide stellar defense at their respective positions, but they’ve also shown that they can handle the bat. O’Neill fits the bill as a prototypical leadoff hitter, with his ability to hit for average, get on base, and steal. O’Hara and Albright also posted solid averages last season, but will be expected to drive the ball more this year as well. With the lineup nearly set, and a host of competent freshmen ready to plug any remaining holes, Harvard has reason for measured optimism regarding its offense. It’s the status of the Crimson’s pitching staff that remains up in the air. Juniors Eric Eadington and Jonathan Strangio are both out for the season because of Tommy John surgery and shoulder surgery, respectively. Sophomore Greg Malley, who came to the Crimson as a highly-touted recruit but has battled injuries since his arrival, will likely miss another year as well. And graduation has been even less kind to Harvard’s staff than injury, considering the loss of rotation stalwarts Shawn Haviland ’08 and Brad Unger ’08. The two were the Crimson’s most reliable arms last season, though neither finished with a winning record. Sophomore Max Perlman’s absence last season hurt the team, but his return gives Harvard a bonafide ace to lead the rotation.The uncertainties lie further down the depth chart. A trio of sophomores—Dan Berardo, Anthony Nutter, and Zach Hofeld—showed promise last season, despite battling inconsistency, and figure to be in the mix. A crop of able freshmen arms, led by Conner Hulse, will also battle for time on the mound. “We’ve got our challenges with some injuries,” Walsh says. “But we brought in a lot of freshman pitching just in case. They’ve all shown flashes. I brought them in here to play, and they want to play.” The Crimson also features lefty Ryan Watson and former Ivy League Rookie of the Year Adam Cole, a pair of senior hurlers looking to go out on a positive note after disappointing careers. Both pitchers have been plagued by control issues in their time at Harvard, but seem committed to exorcising their demons in hopes of turning in a redemptive senior campaign. “Every once in a while both those guys will start throwing 55-footers and you’re kind of, ‘Well here we go,’ and then—boom!—they’re right back in it,” Walsh says. “That would be a huge key for our pitching staff, if those guys could give us a few innings.” The Crimson begins with a tough schedule yet again, with its first thirteen games coming down south. The team opens its campaign with a three-game set against Jacksonville State this weekend, followed by four contests against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Harvard wraps up its road trip with an entire week of play in Louisiana—against Centenary, Louisiana-Monroe, LSU, and New Orleans—before heading back up north. “A lot of teams like to play schools they can beat, but I like to play teams where...at the end of the season, we can say, ‘Hey, we played against these guys, we know what they’ve got, and we’re better now,’” Walsh says. “It makes sense for us to go play good teams and strong teams and we always want to do that. I’m not worried about the record. I’m worried about getting to be the best ball club we can.” This season, the Crimson finally hopes to prove why it has been noted as one of the top teams in the Ivies for the past couple of years.“We’ve tried to move past everything from last year,” Douglas says. “We kind of have to start over completely. We have a completely new attitude.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely does a freshman enter a season facing as much pressure as Conner Hulse. The pitcher will slot straight into the starting rotation at the No. 2 spot, behind sophomore ace Max Perlman, and is expected to eat up the innings that were once the domain of Shawn Haviland ’08. In fact, Hulse will literally put on the same jersey—No. 22—that Haviland wore a year ago. Haviland is now beginning his career within the Oakland Athletics organization, while Hulse looks to help the Harvard baseball team forget the disaster that was the 2008 season. Add the fact that the revamped pitching staff represents the biggest personnel difference in this year’s squad, and Hulse’s right arm could be the key to any success the team is able to achieve in 2009. Hulse, though, doesn’t seem too worried. “I’m excited for it,” Hulse says. “I kind of want the pressure.” This sort of pressure is nothing new to the San Ramon, Ariz., native. He describes how he has played in big games before, rattling off his high school team’s state titles (Horizon was named high school baseball national champions in 2007). Then, Hulse cracks a joke: “Plus, it’s not like we can do worse than last season.” When considering all of the comparisons being made between him and Haviland, he is equally relaxed. “He gives me a hard time about [taking his number],” says Hulse, who has gotten to know the former collegiate star while Haviland has been training at Harvard’s facilities. “He’s a great guy, and hopefully I can develop like he did.” There is, however, at least one major difference between the two right-handers. Unlike Haviland—whose curveball was his trademark pitch—Hulse’s stuff is all about velocity. “He’s a bulldog,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh says. “He throws strikes.” Hulse is the crown jewel in a freshman class that looks capable of contributing right away. Joining Hulse on the pitching staff will be Jeff Wilsey, Will Keuper, and Jonah Klees—a left-handed sidearmer from Chicago. And then there’s Marcus Way. Way was recruited as a pitcher, but when he arrived on campus, he had a very pleasant surprise for the coaching staff. “He’s a left-handed stick who can hit the ball where the grass doesn’t grow,” Walsh says of Way. “He’s one of those guys that’s just been swinging so well he’s going to find his way into the lineup,” Perlman adds. Walsh says that Way has been so impressive in the batter’s box that he could be used as a designated hitter. Another player who will go two ways is Brent Suter. Suter should see significant time on the mound, as well as in the outfield. “He may be one of the best athletes I’ve ever recruited,” Walsh says of Suter. “He glides. He’s one of those guys who you watch and you turn to your kid and say, ‘That’s how you play the outfield.’” “First and foremost I see myself as a pitcher,” Suter says. “[But] I’m hoping to contribute any way I can.” Versatility is perhaps the most important asset of this year’s freshmen. In the entire class, nobody embodies that characteristic better than Jeff Reynolds. “He plays second base, shortstop, third, pitches, plays outfield,” captain Harry Douglas lists. “Coach had him throw a bullpen [session] the other day because he has a really strong arm.” Reynolds could also spell sophomore starting catcher Tyler Albright, competing with fellow freshman Jon Smart, among others, for the primary backup role. J.T. Tomes is another freshman that will see action at a variety of positions, with the ability to play in both the outfield and the infield—primarily at second. But it’s his speed in the field and on the basepaths—Walsh has already identified him as the fastest player on the team—which will allow Tomes to make an immediate impact. “Tomes and Reynolds will definitely be in there,” senior outfielder Tom Stack-Babich says. “They can do a lot of little things, they both run well, can play multiple positions and look like they understand how to play a particular role in helping a team win.” Outfielder Richard Cox of Sardinia, Ohio, rounds out the freshmen position players. From the sound of it, Walsh won’t hesitate to use his rookies. “If [Suter, Tomes, and Cox] was my outfield this year I’d be turning in a very good outfield,” he says. “I’m anxious to see them.” Walsh, of course, is not the only one anxious. The freshmen have all heard plenty about the disappointment of 2008 and are chomping at the bit to get the season started. To see just how integral they could potentially be, this year’s freshmen need look no further than their current sophomore teammates. If it wasn’t for the then-rookies—namely outfielder Dillon O’Neill, infielder Sean O’Hara, and Albright—the team’s 2008 record could have been a lot worse than 10-30. Now it’s up to Hulse and Co. to prove that, with their presence, the 2009 squad will be much more successful. “We are ready to get out of the bubble, get playing, and start making things happen,” Tomes says. —Staff writer Jay M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson’s stalemate with Brown will finally end with a clear winner, as the Harvard men’s hockey team plays host to the 12th-seeded Bears in the first round of the Bank of America ECAC Tournament this weekend. 
The best-of-three series begins tonight at Bright Hockey Center and will determine who advances—and also who goes home.
Although Brown (3-21-5, 3-14-4 ECAC) sits at the bottom of the barrel, the fifth-seeded Crimson (9-14-6, 9-7-6) has failed to notch a win against the squad this season, settling for two ties instead.
Despite the Bears’ place in the standings, Harvard is taking this series seriously.
“At some point it doesn’t really matter how you finish, but how you’re playing at the time,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “They’re an experienced team, they’re on the older side, and they’re physical. It’s going to be intense for us, and we’re not going to underestimate them.”
Once again, the Crimson will have to withstand Brown’s strength on the power play.
In both contests this season, Harvard gave up a number of untimely power play chances in the third period, allowing the Bears to tie with the conversion point.
Despite moments of brilliance, such as a 5-minute penalty kill in last Friday night’s nail-biter against Quinnipiac, the power play has been the Crimson’s Achilles heel for much of the season.
“If you look back at both regular-season games, they beat us on the special teams, and as a result, we only got a point each time,” Fraser said. “So if we concentrate on special teams now hopefully we can come up with the win.”
But while any playoff game should not be taken lightly, Harvard is not the same team as it was in January, when the rivals last faced off.
Then, the Crimson was still waiting to snap a ten-game winless streak, giving up unnecessary penalties, and failing to put enough pucks in the net.
After giving both the No. 1 and then-No. 15 teams a run for their money in the Beanpot Tournament, though, Harvard has been on a hot streak—while the Bears have been on the decline, losing 12 of their last 15 games.
It seems that the Crimson has a tradition of late-season rebounds. Under Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, the team has gone 27-5-4 in regular league play in February and March, and has posted a record of 11-0-4 in its last 15 post-Beanpot games in the regular season. 
“In my four years here it seems to be the way the season has panned out,” Fraser said. “I don’t have a true answer for you [as to why that’s the case]. [But] it’s better to be going well at the end of the season than at the beginning and middle, that’s for sure.”
The Crimson’s current late-season streak closely mirrors the 2008 team’s post-Beanpot turnaround. Last year, after a close overtime loss in the Beanpot Championship, Harvard went 5-0-1 for the remainder of regular season play and advanced to the ECAC tournament finals before giving up a 4-1 loss to Princeton.
This season, since the Crimson’s last-minute Beanpot losses to national powerhouses Boston College and Boston University—the top-ranked teams of 2008 and 2009—Harvard has made another comeback. 
Going undefeated in its last six games, the Crimson managed to best league-leaders like Cornell and No. 6 Princeton to secure fifth place in the ECAC. And it doesn’t look like Harvard plans to stop there.
“I think [our opponents] look and see a team that’s hot and really starting to play well,” junior forward Doug Rogers said. “I’m sure teams know we’re a force to be reckoned with, and they’ll give us their best game.”
Although the Crimson was not able to secure a playoff bye, the squad seems undeterred and is simply eager to let the games begin.
“Looking down at the standings, I shouldn’t say I was happy we didn’t get a bye. It would’ve been nice to have the weekend to rest, but I only have so many games left in my Harvard career,” Fraser said. “If you’re going to win, you’re going to want to win in two rather than three. It’s my last couple home games ever in a Harvard jersey, so I’m looking forward to seven o’clock.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re not used to this here at Harvard.
Come March, the men’s basketball team has been known to fall off the map, going on slide after slide when it matters most.
Luckily for the Crimson, things are a little different this year.
Behind the stellar play of its seniors—led by Ivy Player of the Week senior Drew Housman—and the continued dominance of junior Jeremy Lin, this team is on a roll.
At Penn, the squad dismantled the Quakers down low, with freshman Keith Wright taking it to Penn’s big man.
And even when Wright was sitting on the bench for most of the second half, the team rallied, and once again, it was Housman and Lin to the rescue.
Housman drove the paint, made big bucket after big bucket, and Lin, playing basically on one foot, nailed a dagger of a three and somehow still finished with 12 points.
Last weekend, behind six steals from Housman, the two wreaked havoc again, this time on the lonely Lions.
And against mighty Cornell, the dynamic duo took their skills to a new level—each notching 20 points to take down the first-place squad 71-70.
Winning games late in the season, let alone pulling out close ones late in the game, has never been Harvard’s thing. Finally, it is.
FRIDAY’S GAMES
HARVARD AT BROWN
Last time around, it was Lin coming up big for the Crimson in a 27 point performance, capped by a free-throw with no time left on the clock, to beat the Bears by one.
This time, Harvard is not on three-game losing streak, but rather, a three-game winning streak. And the Bears are 1-11. Harvard looks to continue its winning streak in pursuit of a 7-7 finish in the Ivies. It will.
Harvard 70, Brown 60
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
Both teams still have a shot—although a long one—at a share of the Ivy title. If Cornell loses both games this weekend, and one of these two squads can win both, it’s possible. But I don’t think anyone really thinks it’s going to happen.
Give the edge to the Yalies, who are a strong 4-1 at home this season.
Yale 66, Dartmouth, 63
PENN AT CORNELL
This could be the night Cornell clinches its second straight Ivy League championship. Or, if Penn has its way, it could be the start of an absolutely chaotic last weekend in the Ivies. The Quakers have struggled this season, but have actually played a little better on the road than at home this year. It lost four straight just two weeks ago in the Palestra, a streak unheard of in recent years. 
But in this game, the Big Red is going to come in focused and strong, picking themselves off the proverbial mat that the Crimson put it on.
Cornell 80, Penn 65
PRINCETON AT COLUMBIA
Princeton is knocking on the door of another Ivy League title, and no one can believe it. This is a team who was picked second to last in the Ivy League—now it is in second, just one game out of first. After beating Cornell once already this season, the Tigers are in control of its destiny: win out, and win the Ivies. A win tonight sets up a showdown with the Big Red on Saturday for the title. I want to see it.
Princeton 58, Columbia 51
SATURDAY’S GAMES
HARVARD AT YALE
It seems appropriate for the Ivy season to end here, as the most embittered rivalry takes to the hardwood on Saturday. Harvard will be looking to end strong, giving Amaker something to work off of for next year with a 7-7 finish in the League.
I think they’ll do it—the team is simply playing too well.
Harvard 72, Yale 69
PRINCETON AT CORNELL
This is it. For all the marbles. If Princeton beats Columbia, it will travel down the road to Ithaca, New York, with a chance to knock off the formerly unbeatable Cornell Big Red. 
If it turns out to be a showdown for the title, what a game it will be. 
Nonetheless, expect Cornell to crush—Louis Dale and Ryan Wittman won’t let the team win to a less-talented Princeton squad. It won’t happen. Do you believe in miracles? My answer: nope.
Cornell 76, Princeton 62
PENN AT COLUMBIA
Penn looks to finish respectfully after a midseason swoon. Columbia is picking up the pieces after an impressive start to the season. Look for the Lions to do well at home.
Columbia 66, Penn 61
DARTMOUTH AT BROWN
If you had told me in the beginning of the year that this game might mean something, I would have slapped you right in the face. Go ahead. Build a time machine. Tell me. Then see what happens. Superstar Alex Barnett looks to lead the Big Green to a trouncing of the lowly Brown Bears, with an outside shot at a share of the title on the line. Amazingly.
Dartmouth 75, Brown 63
Record to date: 9-7-0

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year of ups and downs has all but been wiped away. Now, the No. 7 Harvard women’s hockey team is playing to extend its season.
Tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m., on home ice at Bright Hockey Center, the top-seeded Crimson (19-9-3) will face off against sixth-seeded Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (18-13-4) in the ECAC tournament semifinals. The winner moves on to play either No. 8 St. Lawrence or No. 9 Dartmouth for the conference championship on Sunday at 2 p.m.
For Harvard, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Win, and the Crimson’s in—to Sunday’s title game and, more than likely, the national tournament. Lose, and the team could easily be left out of the NCAA bracket.
“It is pretty much do or die at this point in the season,” sophomore Kate Buesser said. “It’s the playoffs, so every team is going to be bringing their best.”
Of the four teams still alive in the tournament, Harvard had the easiest time in the quarterfinals, blanking Cornell in consecutive contests. But the upstart Engineers enter the game with some momentum as well, coming off a weekend sweep of third-seeded Princeton.
In just its third season in the ECAC, RPI is playing in its first championship weekend. Like the Crimson, the Engineers have had a streaky season, but they charge into tomorrow’s game having gone 6-0-1 in their last seven conference games.
When the teams met at Bright in November, RPI scored with 18 seconds left in regulation to earn a 1-1 draw with Harvard. The Crimson exacted revenge in January with a 5-4 win, but once again let the Engineers come back in the game’s final minutes. 
“[We just want] to play 60 minutes of hockey, or however long it takes,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They’re a good team…they’re not going to quit, and our players know that. They’ll be ready to play.”
RPI’s recent success is due in large part to goaltender Sonja van der Bliek. Over the course of the Engineers’ latest win streak, the sophomore hasn’t given up more than one goal in any game, recording a .967 save percentage to go with a miniscule 0.84 goals-against average.
Last weekend alone, van der Bliek turned away 63 of the Tigers’ 64 shots to lead RPI to its first playoff series victory.
“We know that RPI has been riding a very hot goaltender lately, and we know they are a really good team,” Buesser said. “But we are ready.”
The Crimson’s got a hot goaltender of its own in Christina Kessler. The junior, who was named to the All-ECAC Second Team this week, made 62 saves last weekend in back-to-back shutouts.
“Kessler’s doing everything she needs to do for the team,” Stone said. “Her contribution is the same as anybody else’s—keep it simple, do the things you do well—and she’s doing that for us at a good time.”
Kessler’s the anchor of a Harvard defense that ranks fourth nationally and fifth on the penalty kill. In its last 61 man-down situations, the Crimson has scored as many goals as it has allowed (two). 
Though tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt, named ECAC Player of the Year and a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award this week, continues to pace the Harvard offense, it’s the depth of the team’s attack that will be crucial as the postseason continues.
“Everybody did their job [last weekend],” Stone said. “We got scoring from multiple lines, and special teams were very good, so hopefully we can continue that. The main thing is that we continue to play our game.”
The Crimson also benefits from home-ice advantage in the tournament for the second year running. Last season, the fans at Bright helped propel Harvard to a 3-2 overtime victory over St. Lawrence in the championship game.
“It’s awesome, and to have earned it down the stretch, how well we played the second half of the season—it makes a difference,” Stone said. “It’s great to be able to play in front of your own fans and band.”
A possible rematch with the Saints in the title game isn’t far from the team’s mind.
“We recently played against St. Lawrence, and I don’t think they brought us their best game,” Vaillancourt said. “If we play them in the final, they will definitely bring their best game, and it’s going to be a really tough game to play.”
But to get there, the Crimson must take care of business tomorrow. With so much on the line, Harvard can’t afford to take the Engineers for granted.
“You just try to win your next game—that’s your focus, and that’s what you hope to accomplish,” Stone said. “We’re just trying to win our next hockey game.”

It's official: HMS Professor Jim Kim is off to be President of Dartmouth, putting a spotlight on Asians in the Ivy League.  Reactions around the ancient eight have been somewhat...mixed.
An email circulated at Dartmouth, published yesterday by IvyGate (O hey guys!), contained some pretty inflammatory language on the topic of Kim’s race.  Some are calling it satire, others outright racism. An excerpt from the email:
In a bizarre coincidence, this cropping up of Asian stereotypes has arrived just in time for Harvard’s Asian American Association to debut its first ever “Mr. Asian Sensation” beauty pageant. On the invitation, the AAA offers all those with a “bad case of that yellow fever” to see “Harvard’s most attractive boys of the Asian Persuasion duke it out for the honor of being the hottest Asian male on campus.” The winner will go on to compete in a Boston-wide pageant for hot Asian dudes held at Wellesley.
We all know what came next. Any Harvard event + race/sexuality/gender/hair color = Endless house email list debate. This time Kirkland stepped up and pulled the “Isn’t this offensive?” trigger. Highlights from the 30+ thread after the jump:

Someone explain rantblogger.com to me! Because as far as I can tell, it makes absolutely no sense.
So it’s a website started by a Harvard student. It’s a blog. It’s about complaining about stuff. So far so good. But he pays people to write this stuff? For a website that was designed with Windows 95 and has no advertising to be paying as much as $10 per post to random people is unbelievable. Where does he get this money? And the posts are barely worth the energy your computer uses up while you read them.
Duh! Poor people totally caused the mortgage crisis!
Wait, actually Nutella caused the mortgage crisis! More ranting after the jump!
The fact the guy who runs Rant Blogger pays for all of this out of his own pocket is ridiculous in this economy. While other newspapers, magazines, and blogs are scrambling for money to stay in business, he just gives it away to anyone with a PayPal account. Normally we can’t get mad at people for getting money, but can this even actually be called a business model? Even Facebook, the grandaddy of all Web 2.0 start-ups that ignored monetization at first, is now having some money problems.
Why don’t we give up this whole blogging thing and just start a website cataloguing the crackpot websites started by Harvard students. (Remember Gossip Geek? Or Yard Report? We don't either.) Apparently there’s money in anything you can buy a domain name for.
By the way, how much do I get paid for this?

EDITOR'S NOTE BELOW
How the times do change.  Just a couple of months ago, Benjamin P. Schwartz '10, Undergraduate Council presidential candidate and everyman extraordinaire was...well...everywhere.   Wearing his Crimson Key sweatshirt, wielding his blackberry, assuring students that his membership in the Fly final club was only a small part of what he was about, emphasizing that--hell,  why not?--being a member of a final club could help him  "bridge divides" among members of the student body.  And, of course, there was that Girl Talk concert that he organized.  That was fun.  Could've been a bit longer, though, don't you think?
Anyway, a word to all the divided out there:  Mr. Schwartz might be a little less available to bridge these days.  We've heard that he's de-activated resigned his Crimson Key membership.  And his attendance at UC meetings this semester has been a bit.....spotty.   Spotty enough, as it happens, to merit expulsion according to the UC by-laws: (CLARIFICATION: Schwartz later said he would have contested some of the absences that would have made him eligible for expulsion.) 
 
The UC Bylaws Section 22 stipulate that any representative who has been absent from three or more regular Council meetings, three or more regular Committee Meetings, or any combination of four absences from regular Council meetings and regulard committee meetings will be expelled from the council.
But wait! Expulsion won't be necessary, after all.  In fact, screw the UC.  Schwartz quits!  More after the jump.
The Schwartz spin machine has whirred into action. With true Carvillian flourish, he delivered this  gem to the UC open list on Wednesday:
I stayed on the UC this semester because there are several projects about which I care deeply...The ball is rolling...on alternative social space...Given my experience of the past several weeks, I'm now convinced that I'll be just as effective helping to accomplish these goals from off the Council as I would be as a representative.
Apparently Schwartz thinks he can advocate just as effectively for alternative social space from inside the Fly as he can at his UC committee meeting.  We're fine with that.  In fact, it probably would have been a shame to elect a UC President who wasn't going to come to the meetings.  The real tragedy here is that Ben's going to have to update his facebook profile.  Listing CKS and UC after you leave the ring?  Not kosher, says FlyByBlog.  And that profile pic might have to go, Crimson Key sweatshirt and all.  Here's to advocacy, Ben!
EDITOR'S NOTE: A photo originally accompanying this post was taken from Schwartz's Facebook page without contacting him first and has since been removed.

The Cambridge Center for Adult Education on Brattle Street -- familiar host to many a sketchy Harvard party -- has reportedly been slapped with a cease and desist order from the friendly neighborhood fire department. That means yet another rare Harvard Square party venue is rendered effectively dead, and as a result, Harvard groups that hoped to plan parties in the popular space are out of luck.
Even a bash slated for tomorrow night is in peril: "Just Dance", an open party planned by Crimson Key Society and CityStep, has been indefinitely postponed.
The best part of all this? The CCAE didn't find out they were under probation until after the Harvard groups canceled. Seems like continuing education doesn't involve keeping up with paperwork. More after the jump.
The party, called "Just Dance" à la pants-averse provocateur-cum-techno diva Lady Gaga, has been generating buzz on campus for weeks. But excitement is now at a standstill, after party goers were officially informed via Facebook early this afternoon that Gaga was a no-go.
Other campus groups have reportedly had trouble booking events at the normally lax CCAE, and now we know why: Crimson Key president Lee Ann W. Custer '10, who is also a Crimson Arts editor,  sent a facebook message to attendees explaining that:
followed by a message offering to refund tickets.
Though the new date isn't set, one thing is for sure: this weekend, Harvard students will be searching for "adult education" elsewhere.
Disclosure: the author of this post is a member of Crimson Key Society.

Asian Studies: Hot Major (Dartmouth)
Seems like the mastermind of our bailout from the Depression 2.0 would have majored in Economics.  But Tim Geithner actually majored in the same subject as Kirsten Gillibrand while at Dartmouth: Asian Studies.
In case the American economy does fall apart, we can rest assured that Geithner will be able to communicate with our new Chinese lords in Mandarin.  In any case, he looked kind of nerdy while at Dartmouth, compared to now at the confirmation hearings, where he looked kind of in charge.  Check after the jump for some sex and relationship advice, courtesy of Cornell.
Awkward Relationship Advice (Cornell)
We thought that the best part of the Cornell Daily Sun was its weekly self-written weekly horoscopes, but we were wrong.  They also offer valuable relationship advice to girls who want more out of that random hook-up.
I made out with a boy last weekend. We had a really great time — I even slept over at his house (not in the biblical sense), but he never asked for my number. I felt like we really hit it off, so I am completely confused as to why he would not call. Should I try to contact him?
Sincerely, 
Ditched?
The solution from Z?  Watch a chick flick.  That will wipe the emotional scars away.
More Awkard Relationship Advice (Princeton)
The Daily Princetonian still has their  "Sexpert" to go into unnecessary details, but that isn't enough.  They also have an "Awkspert" to offer his/her "impressive resume of ungraceful personal experiences to the nation’s service and the service of all nations."
The Awkspert is not innocent as he/she sounds, though.  When one Princeton student asks how he should woo someone who's good friends with his ex, the Awkspert declares, "This is an easy one. All you need to do is put an end to their friendship."
The Awkspert then goes into great detail about how to ruin their friendship--just so that the guy doesn't have to feel awkward while he's flirting with his new target.  Harvard's dating scene is effectively nonexistent, but at least it's not Machiavellian.
President Holds Fireside Chat (Columbia)
Lee Bollinger, who was a candidate for Harvard's presidency while serving in the top spot at the University of Michigan, is now channeling FDR and holding Fireside Chats as Columbia's president.  Very presidential, this man.
Teaching Fellows, Unite! (Yale)
While Harvard workers are rallying outside of Mass. Hall, guess who's rallying to unionize at Yale?  Grad students.  Long oppressed by a dismal job market, Yale's Graduate Employees and Students Organization is campaigning for the eighth year in the row for the university to recognize them as a union.  They are no fringe group either: over half of Yale's grad students are in it.
Let's imagine for a moment what the rallying cry of an English Ph.D student might be:  "Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing...For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?"
