After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the undefeated Harvard women’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) tested its abilities against competitors at multi-day invitationals near and far: the Texas Hall of Fame Invite, the MIT Winter Invitational and the UGA Fall Invitational.
MIT WINTER INVITATIONAL
While most of the Crimson swimmers made the trek to Austin, a smaller group stayed in Cambridge where Harvard took on its crosstown competitors, as well as athletes from Bowdoin, Tufts and Wellesley.
The first day of competition saw two races. Opening with the 800-yard free relay, Harvard finished second with a time of 7 minutes, 40.51 seconds. Later that evening, junior Marlee Ehrlich placed first in the 1650-yard free.
The Crimson continued to slate top-three finishes, with junior Shori Hijikata placing first and third in the 200-yard butterfly and 300-yard IM, respectively. Junior Margaret Ramsey and sophomore Willa Wang took first and third in the 200-yard fly as well.
Harvard finished the meet with a slew of top-five finishes, including taking first, third and fourth in the 500-yard free.
UGA FALL INVITATIONAL
The diving team spent the weekend away from its swimming counterpart, traveling to Athens, Ga.
In the team’s first competition, the 3-meter springboard, freshman Hannah Allchurch led Harvard, placing sixth with a score of 290.95.  She was trailed by fellow freshmen Jing Leung and Alisha Mah, who placed 11th and 15th, respectively.
The next day saw Allchurch’s dominance continue in the 1-meter competition. Her 266.05 finish put her in fifth, while sophomore Elina Leiviska placed eighth, and Mah took 15th.
In the Crimson’s final event, Leung took center stage, placing fifth in platform diving, an event she has not competed in yet this year.
TEXAS HALL OF FAME INVITE
Thursday morning, most of the Harvard swimmers took to the Lee and Joe Jamail Texas Swimming Center, priming themselves for a weekend filled with NCAA ‘B’ cut times, top-10 finishes and a school record.
The NCAA ‘B’ cut constitutes a swimmer who, if in the top 39 by the end of the season, qualifies for the national tournament. With many Crimson swimmers achieving these times, Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ‘92 has high hopes.
“We had some people do some really good things,” Morawski said. “Hopefully we’ll be in a situation where we’ll have multiple people qualify [for Nationals]. That’s our goal—to not only win the Ivy League, but to send as many people to NCAAs as possible.”
Junior Danielle Lee, who represented Harvard at NCAAs last year, put up a plethora of top-20 finishes including a third and fourth place finish in 100- and 200-yard back events, respectively. She achieved NCAA ‘B’ cuts in both these races, and her performance in the 200-yard back also marked Lee’s second Crimson record.
These races proved eventful for Lee’s teammates as well. In the 100-yard back, junior Kendall Crawford and freshman Kristina Li both achieved NCAA ‘B’ times. Harvard also entered a meet-high of five swimmers in the finals of the 200-yard back.
Co-captain Stephanie Ferrell also put up two NCAA ‘B’ cuts, finishing 12th in the 100-yard breaststroke and 10th in the 200-yard breast.
“Getting an NCAA ‘B’ cut is a really great way to track how we’re doing,” Ferrell said. “It’s a great accomplishment and it does place us up there on a national level.”
Enoch also continued to put up high-caliber times, slating a seventh place finish and NCAA ‘B’ cut in the 400-yard IM. Enoch also closed Friday’s proceedings with a fourth place finish in the 800-yard free relay, alongside teammates Lee, sophomore Victoria Chan and junior Sherry Liu.
With three days of back to back competition and each swimmer racing in multiple individual and relay events every day, the Crimson had to come together to overcome fatigue and compete at its highest level.
“We stay focused [at the end of a meet] really by turning to each other,” Ferrell said. “I think that’s one of the things that our team does so well. We use each other as motivation. We kept the energy up and really lifted each other up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (7-1) wrapped up its 2014 home slate with a 70-56 win over the visiting Boston University Terriers (2-6). After a tight first 30 minutes of play, the Crimson outscored BU, 25-11, over the final 10:39 of the game, at one point holding the Terriers without a field goal for more than seven consecutive minutes.
“I thought they played a tremendous ballgame,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They scrapped and competed and made it very hard for us. Certainly it was a tight game and I think it was tied up there, 45-all, and then we were able to get back to a comfortable margin there. You give a lot of credit to their team and coach Joe Jones and the job that he has done there.”
Harvard began the game with a sluggish first half. After the Crimson took an early 12-8 lead, the Terriers transitioned to a smaller lineup that gave Harvard fits on the defensive end. The BU two-three zone proved difficult to crack, with many Crimson possessions ending in errant threes by guards Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller. At one point, five of six Crimson possessions ended with one of the two clanging a shot off the rim.
The Crimson broke through late on the shoulders of leading scorer senior wing Wesley Saunders. The wing, who leads the Crimson in scoring at over 20 points a game, played the distributor role for most of the first half, dishing out six assists. After consecutive fast-break layups gave BU a three-point lead with four minutes to go, Saunders took over.
First it was a drive into the lane where he thought pass from the start, finding a curling Miller for his first three of the night. Two possessions later, he rebounded a Miller miss and splashed a trey of his own to give Harvard a three-point lead.
“I think Wes is who Wes is,” Chambers said. “He showed this last year and this is who he is…. This year, I think he has been a little more consistent throughout the start of the season, but I don’t see any change in how he is playing from last year to this year. He’s still playing great defense on the best player and giving you some great numbers on the glass [and] assisting.
The second half was more of the same, with Harvard making just under 35 percent of its shots and missing three-quarters of its threes. The Crimson compensated with free throw shooting, going to the line 17 times and making all but one.
After watching an eight-point lead evaporate in a flurry of John Papale threes, it was Saunders again, with five points and two assists in a 12-2 run that put the Crimson ahead by double digits. The lead never shrunk below eight the rest of the way as Harvard hit its last 13 free throws.
“I think we’ve been really good at closing games; it’s been our start that’s really hurt us,” Saunders said. “In terms of finishing games, we’ve done a pretty solid job.”
Amaker’s oft-cited priorities—the team’s bench and its balance—played a big role for the Crimson on Monday night. Five different players had at least eight points, and eight played at least 10 minutes. Although Saunders was again the star, leading the Crimson with 15 points and holding star Terrier Wing Cedric Hankerson to three points, the Crimson’s bench nearly outscored the starters with 29 points of its own. Sophomore forward Zena Edosomwan had eight points in 13 minutes off the pine, with Miller adding 14 points of his own.
“When Corbin hits shots it really changes our team,” Saunders said. “Everyone gets more excited and into the game. Those threes he hits are big momentum changers and I think you saw that tonight.”
Edosomwan was part of a stiff defensive front that limited the Terriers to just 32 percent shooting in the second half. With the exception of Blaise Mbargorba, who had 13 off the bench on six-for-eight shooting, the Terriers were unable to get anything going inside against the Crimson.
With senior forward Jonah Travis dressed to play but not healthy enough to come off the bench, Edosomwan played the second-most minutes of his season. Setting hard screens on the outside and fighting hard for rebounds down low, the sophomore—who finished with a positive five plus-minus on the day—filled in ably in relief for the struggling senior forwards Kenyatta Smith (four points, 15 minutes) and Steve Moundou-Missi (two-for-seven shooting).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After not losing a game in over a year, the Harvard men’s squash team (1-2, 1-0 Ivy) fell twice this weekend on the road in New York, falling to No. 2 St. Lawrence Saturday and No. 5 University of Rochester on Sunday. The No. 1 Crimson women (2-0, 1-0 Ivy), meanwhile, cruised at home against Boston College.
Rochester 5, Harvard 4
The Yellowjackets (5-1, 3-1 Liberty League) handed Harvard its second loss of the weekend in a tightly contested match in Rochester, N.Y.
Rochester freshman Tomotaka Endo defeated sophomore Bryan Koh in four games at the fourth seed in the decisive final match. After losing his first two games, Koh fought his way back by winning the third, 11-8. Endo, however, clinched the victory after a hard-fought fourth game that went to 13 points.
The Crimson struggled early with four losses in the first five games. The top three spots on Harvard’s ladder—freshman Madhav Dhingra, freshman Bradley Smith, and sophomore Dylan Murray—all fell to their opponents, with only Smith forcing an extra game.
Harvard’s depth evened out the score with wins from players at the bottom half of the ladder.
Captain Tyler Olson obtained his third win in three games this season at the seventh spot, defeating sophomore Aria Fazelimanesh.
Sophomore Devin McLaughlin won in five games to pick up his first win of the season.
The Crimson drew even with wins from fifth-seeded junior Matt Roberts and ninth-seeded junior Sam Goldberg before Endo and Koh finished their match at the fourth seed.
St. Lawrence 7, Harvard 2
No. 2 toppled No. 1 in Canton, N.Y. on Saturday.
Four St. Lawrence (6-0, 4-0) players won their matches in straight games to hand the visitors their first defeat in over a year. At the first seed, Saints’ senior Amr Khalifa proved his 2014 CSA individual national champion title with an 11-5, 11-5, 11-4 win over Dhingra.
Harvard’s two wins of the day came from Olson at the seventh seed and Smith at the second seed. Smith bested freshman Edgar Zayas in four games after losing the first, and Olson swept senior Sebastian Riedelsheimer in three.
Koh and McLaughlin’s losses came after five close games. Both sophomores lost their fifth games by a score of 11-9, falling to senior Ibrahim Khan and freshman Hussein Elrayes, respectively.
Harvard 9, Boston College 0
The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team (2-0 1-0 Ivy) secured its second sweep in as many matches, defeating the Eagles this weekend at the Murr Athletic Center.
The Crimson players defeated all nine of their opponents in three games. Sophomores Caroline Monrad and Keegan Mendez earned their first wins for the Crimson this season at the eighth and ninth spots.
Freshmen Alyssa Mehta (No. 2) and Sue Ann Yong (No. 4) posted dominant performances. Yong shut out Katherine Nueberger in the second game, and Mehta conceded only one point to Alison Johnston in the third game. Rookie Saumya Karki picked up another win as well.
