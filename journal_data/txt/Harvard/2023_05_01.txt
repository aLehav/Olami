After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The panic has begun.
Seniors forming allyships based on the cities they’ll be in post-graduation. Visitas pre-frosh posting selfies with friends they won’t talk to again. Fellow social-seniors creating group chats to scramble together facsimiles of the soon-to-be-graduated social circles we’ve built over the past four years.
In short, at pivotal life moments, when we or others move on, it’s like the first week of summer camp all over again: politicking around until we construct secure social networks to assuage our fears of being friendless.
I don’t mean to mock this worry. In fact, our yearning for social acceptance is rooted in our evolutionary desire to survive. And loneliness is a significant issue among today’s youth: A 2021 study noted that 61 percent of those aged 18-25 reported serious loneliness.
Still, I propose that we shouldn’t try to force social connections, and that we should instead accept more antisocial tensions to cultivate lasting friendships.
There’s nothing wrong with trying to find friends, yet constantly seeking new commitments may be part of what’s known as the “grass is greener syndrome” — the suspicion that there’s always a more socially rewarding event or cooler potential friend. Unfortunately, a possible repercussion of this anxiety is that we come to care more about the validation of warm bodies around us than actual connection with the personhood of others. So let’s take a breath and get to know one another — and not just swipe left to gather more options, Tinder-style.
We also can redirect our efforts if we sense we’re with unsuitable company. Loneliness isn’t the same as being alone – rather, it’s your perceived gap between the level of connectedness that you want and what you have, regardless of literal social contact. So while it’s reasonable to stick with a first hodge-podge posse in a new environment, I hope we don’t sacrifice genuine emotional connection for social safety.
Retrospectively, I cringe at how I used to force myself into situations where deep-down, I knew my connections didn’t click, from mistrials at Annenberg to summer internship evenings spent competing for conversation airtime. I realize now that even in large groups, I was lonely since I didn’t vibe with the people around me — and that I sometimes would’ve been happier in my own company.
Of course, we should still approach potential new friends! I just hope to remind us that we don’t have to pressure ourselves into social molds – which is hard when others seem to have idyllic social lives or super-tight friend units, like those that charted through pandemics and spring breaks together.
But I think of how I’ve stumbled upon my cherished friendships, one-by-one, over many years — through literary magazines, technology clubs, and random events. Friendships aren’t a scarce resource we’re competing for on a finite timeline: We should take time, and have so much time, to plant and tend to them, in a way that works for us.
Moreover, to cultivate lasting friendships, I suggest we welcome antisocial tensions. Of course, we shouldn’t condone problematic behavior. But we also shouldn’t avoid addressing friction in friendships — especially because maturely raising issues signals emotional trust and a desire to invest in that relationship long-term. In fact, a 2012 study revealed that participants who engaged in open, non-blaming conversations experienced deeper relationship intimacy than those who didn’t.
So in the past year, even though I’m conflict-avoidant, I’ve tried to better invite and respond to thoughts about me as a friend, like when I haven’t been as proactive as I should. I’ve also grown better at expressing my opinion, like when my health or introvertedness means I can’t meet someone’s social needs.
And honestly? Sometimes we have to prioritize ourselves over social harmony —  which can clash with the notion of being a “good person.” Case in point: I distance myself from people who, even if friendly, only suggest hangouts in a networky, oh-right-you-exist vibe. Another example: I am often mentally and physically drained and forget to reply to messages, which then devolves into a vicious cycle of guilt at not replying and fear of replying. But I’m glad I’m aware of it, so when I do have capacity, I can strive to be a kinder person, one message at a time.
***
At the end of day, we’re simple creatures: We want to be seen and to see others. We inevitably go through summer-camp phases to figure out how we fit into each others’ lives, if at all. Sometimes, we slip through the cracks and find ourselves alone, but as long as we put our genuine energy into the world, I believe we’ll cross paths with the right people. (Honestly, I feel so lucky to have found such good people in my life, that maybe I shouldn’t be dispensing any friend-making advice).
I hope to not feel lonely after my friends graduate. I hope to take care of myself. I hope to be a good person to my loved ones. Yet I know I might compromise my individuality to fit in, I might ignore my needs due to academic or social pressures, and that I won’t always be a 100 percent perfect human.
I want to hold these hopes and hypocrisies, and live as genuinely and compassionately as I can. I’d love for you to join me (and perhaps grab a coffee sometime).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Hi! We’re fundraising for the crisis in Sudan right now —”
“Sorry, I’m not interested.”
The past week of my life has been defined by the repetition of this interaction, accompanied by glances of pity and discomfort as I haul around posters and flyers advertising the fundraiser for medical relief for the crisis in Sudan. My peers avoid eye contact, cross the street, or rush to classes, dodging another plea for money for another seemingly backwards nation in crisis.
And it’s not to say that such a reaction is entirely unwarranted. In a world where we, as struggling college students, are inundated by a slew of worthy causes, it is hard — and frankly, emotionally taxing — to pick and choose which ones to amplify and donate to.
But what my peers do not realize is that to me, this is everything. The home and livelihood of my family, the streets I spent my childhood wandering — bombed and burned before my eyes.
On April 15, a war broke out in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, between the national army and a powerful paramilitary group. In the two weeks since, hundreds of civilians have been killed and thousands more wounded. More than half of Khartoum’s 59 hospitals have been shut down by the crisis, leaving very few open facilities to service its population of 6.3 million. Water and electricity have been cut off across much of the city, and the United Nations has termed the situation a humanitarian catastrophe.
Yet, many international relief organizations have stopped operations in Sudan. Powerful nations, including the United States, have pulled out their diplomatic personnel through emergency military evacuations in the span of barely over a week.
If you’ve been on Instagram or watched the news in the past few weeks, you may have caught glimpses of the crisis: Pictures of the capital burning, videos of soldiers firing into homes, and loaded tanks parading through the ash-covered streets. Alternatively, you may have heard about the crisis from the several people and organizations supporting the fundraiser at Harvard.
But these short interactions can only help so much, because the media continues to focus primarily on death and destruction rather than the conflict’s humanitarian toll, framing my people as complicit in a war we have no stake in. A war which cannot be won.
Corpses now litter the streets I walked just a few months ago, in a city where it is now a privilege to escape from and become a refugee. Yet it seems that the plight of Sudan falls upon deaf ears, our suffering almost an expectation of the international community. There is a perception that this is, and has always been, our normal.
I cannot help but compare our situation today to the beginning of the war in Ukraine a little over a year ago. Harvard flew Ukrainian flags in solidarity with American ones, held vigils and fundraisers, and hosted political discussions that were not suggestions but the expectation. I wonder why, when the current humanitarian toll is comparable, that the same courtesy and care is not afforded to us as well.
The answer, quite simply, is that where I see the beautiful, endless, glittering Nile, the towering pyramids, the rich and fertile soils that have raised generations of my family, and the fierce warriors of my proud Nubian bloodline, the world sees violence, death, and destruction.
How can the world possibly see humanity now when our African bodies were written off as disposable centuries ago?
How can it understand that we have one of the richest traditions of successful democratic civil uprisings in the world?
How can it see that when the coup came, when our democratic dreams of 2019 were dashed by the Sudanese military in 2021, we continued to fight? That it was the international community that legitimized the rule of power-hungry men in their own self-interest? That we were silenced, our dreams for democracy used to strangle our very being?
How can it begin to imagine our resistance, our livelihoods, our smiles, our power, our kindness?
The answer is that on the international stage, Sudan does not matter.
We are not just disposable — we are a nuisance. It feels like our diverse and beautiful population of 46 million people is written off as inconvenient, standing between the Western world and untapped natural resources. It feels as though the success of the international community can be equated with our extinction. Our inescapable reality was a controlled detonation waiting to go off to the nations of the West, a pressure cooker where the lives of the 16,000 American citizens who remain in Sudan are not deemed a priority, it seems, because of the otherness — the Blackness — of the Sudanese people.
And so, I question how it is possible that I entered college four years ago having been a part of the successful Sudanese democratic revolution, proud to inject my nation in the academic and political discussions here — yet I leave with a nation in tatters, and depart from a university that could not have done less to help.
Yet I will continue to fight and advocate and fundraise for Sudan. The international community may have written us off, but I guarantee you we will fight for survival with our very last breath. Sudan is deserving of freedom. Of peace. Of justice. Of life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, a group of Harvard professors made national headlines for banding together to form a group dedicated to a cause that should be obviously worth rallying behind: academic freedom.
We agree with the Board that these concerns about suppression of speech from both sides of the political aisle are certainly well-substantiated. Almost 60 percent of college students report reluctance to discuss controversial topics — almost the same share of adults reporting that the political climate prevents them from expressing their ideas.
Clearly, something is wrong with our discourse.
Cultivating a culture of fruitful discussions involves more than just avoiding censorship; we must also strive to listen to one another with an open mind, in order to create an environment where we can engage with challenging concepts and find veritas. Our Board said it best: “we must make an effort to understand opposing arguments in good faith.”
We could not agree more, and were thus disappointed by the Board’s assumption today that the Council of Academic Freedom at Harvard’s mission is not a genuine effort to support academic freedom. By calling the council’s explanation for its formation “dishonest” and thereby assuming malicious intent from the signatories, the Board has failed to practice the very credit and kindness it has called upon others to extend in civil discourse.
In a similar assumption, the Board criticizes the council’s supposed conflation of academic freedom with freedom from criticism. In fact, the council’s own statements explicitly draw a distinction between these two concepts, even encouraging criticism. Its press release could not state it more clearly: “Academic freedom does not mean freedom from criticism – quite the opposite.”
It seems that the Board has more beliefs in common with the council than they are willing to admit.
We also take issue with the unconstructive nature of the Board’s criticism. Persuading more than 100 faculty members to sign onto any kind of council is quite a feat; to unite such a diverse cohort is even more difficult. The Board’s failure to propose a better initiative for defending free speech and inability to recognize the sheer size of this council does not serve justice to the impressive achievement of convincing dozens of Harvard faculty members to join notoriously conservative Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53 behind a cause.
Furthermore, singling out three of the 100-plus members of the council as proof of its flaws seems unfair. Although we may criticize some faculty on this campus, it would be contradictory for a council designated to protect academic speech to refuse membership to some professors on the basis of their work. We applaud the council’s decision to make membership open to all members of the faculty, particularly non-tenured members who may be more fearful of backlash to their opinions, and hope that they continue to do so in the future.
Should the signatories fail to live up to the ideals contained in the announcement, we’ll be the first to criticize them. But we should begin by assuming good faith and remaining hopeful about the council. Their proactive goals — lecture series, workshops, and classes — will be welcome additions to campus, and we look forward to this council defending the academic freedom that is so vital to our campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there’s one thing this campus seems it will never be free from, it’s the discourse on academic freedom.
Recently, this discourse has taken the form of the new Council on Academic Freedom at Harvard: a group of more than 70 Harvard professors gathered to protect free academic inquiry at Harvard. They plan to organize workshops and courses on academic freedom, stand in solidarity with Harvard academics whose speech is curtailed, and overall hold the University accountable for free inquiry.
This Editorial Board has been a steady supporter of free exchange of opinions for years. Any other stance would be hypocritical of us; we depend on people feeling empowered to speak, argue, and defend their opinions in order to function.
We thus agree with the principles motivating the council. Any initiative that seeks to encourage academic freedom can count us as a first friend. But our continued support requires an honest effort to support the neutral ideal of academic freedom on campus.
Frankly, the explanation of the council’s formation in the Boston Globe reads to us as dishonest. In council members Steven A. Pinker and Bertha K. Madras’ own words, “When activists are shouting into an administrator’s ear, we will speak calmly but vigorously into the other one.”
This language inappropriately portrays activism as an agitated impulsive monolith, incapable of measured thought. In reality, activists span from writers and artists printing calls for action, to organizers rallying with megaphones in hand. And even the loudest protests require dedication and planning.
Furthermore, activism and academic freedom are allies, not foes. Just this semester, activism has been instrumental in ensuring academic freedom on campus. The council would benefit from collaborating with, rather than castigating, activists.
This disregard towards advocacy signals to us a larger worry that the council is taking a one-sided view of academic freedom, conflating this freedom of speech with freedom from criticism or accountability. Academic freedom requires academic value; factually incorrect opinions, no matter how reviled, cannot lay claim to such protections.
Among the council are members whose controversies are not matters of slighted academic freedom, but of reasonable backlash given their nonacademic content. J. Mark Ramseyer’s interpretation of comfort women as contracted sex workers was flagrantly false considering the historical record, and not worth our time. Kit K. Parker’s unethical course on policing completely disregarded racial concerns, undermining its claims to objectivity. Ronald S. Sullivan Jr.’s decision to defend Harvey Weinstein blatantly betrayed the trust of his Winthrop House students. These improper actions cannot hide under calls to some ‘get out of jail free card’ of academic freedom.
The inclusion of these professors on the council undermines the entire initiative’s integrity as a faithful advocate for academic freedom across the political spectrum. What kind of scholarship does the council truly want to protect? Surely not only the kinds of pseudoscience that receive “crippling accusations of racism, sexism, or transphobia,” as Pinker and Madras seem so afraid of.
The suppression of academic freedom is an issue that knows no political lines, existing even for academics researching these very systems of oppression. True support of academic freedom requires protecting people of all ideologies. Would the council have protected the freedom of Cornel R. West ’74 and Lorgia García Peña, two professors denied tenure seemingly as a result of the novel content of their otherwise uncontroversially exceptional academic work? Will it protect non-American scholars persecuted for their research and identities?
Ultimately, academic freedom can only thrive in an environment where we lean into, not run from, discourse. Across the political spectrum and the nation, there is too often a knee-jerk reaction to call beliefs beyond the pale, without seriously engaging with the issues.
Everyone should feel free to express their controversial opinions, but others should feel just as free to respond. While we should recognize the historical and identity-based reasons that certain conversations are discomforting, this is not a sign to stop speaking, but to start speaking respectfully. In thinking critically and kindly together, we can construct a campus-wide academic freedom worth having.
We don’t entirely trust the council’s intentions in constructing this freedom right now, but we remain cautiously optimistic for its future. You might see us in the audience of upcoming workshops, hoping for our skepticism in the council to be proven wrong. Until then, in the spirit of free inquiry, we’ve provided our criticisms to build a more productive campus discourse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge residents and Harvard affiliates gathered at the John W. Weeks Bridge Saturday to rally against the decision to close Memorial Drive to traffic only on Sundays, rather than for the whole weekend.
The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation announced that a stretch of Memorial Drive — also referred to as Riverbend Park — would close the road to vehicles on Sundays only in a tweet on April 3, drawing criticism from Harvard students and Cambridge city councilors. In response, the Harvard College Democracy House circulated a petition the following Tuesday on campus to demand full weekend closures.
The shutdown of a portion of Memorial Drive to vehicles began when the Massachusetts Legislature passed a law in 1985 to close a portion from Western Avenue to Gerry’s Landing Road from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Sunday for recreational purposes.
At the Cambridge City Council’s request, the DCR began closing Memorial Drive on Saturdays as well starting 2020 through 2022.
The DCR’s April 3 decision defied the council’s 7-2 vote to keep Memorial Drive closed to vehicle traffic on both Sunday and Saturday.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui briefly spoke at the rally, sharing her strong support for the traffic closures, in keeping with the City Council’s majority vote.
Massachusetts State Rep. Michael L. Connolly said he was “very disappointed” by the DCR’s announcement.
“I think there’s a way for us to open Riverbend Park on Saturdays while at the same time addressing the concerns of abutters, and we’ve heard a lot of great suggestions,” he said. “I take a 7-2 or 8-1 vote by a city council to mean a lot. That’s the reflection of the will of our community.”
In a statement to the Boston Herald, DCR spokersperson Ilyse Wolberg wrote that the road’s reopening on Saturdays marks a return to its pre-Covid schedule. The full weekend closure created “concerns about elevated traffic and pollution in surrounding residential neighborhoods,” she wrote.
“While this effort was a success in expanding access to outdoor recreation, it was not without its negative impacts,” Wolberg wrote.
Christopher A. Cassa — a member of the Memorial Drive Alliance, a local group focused on natural preservation and enhanced pedestrian access for Memorial Drive — said he was “extremely disheartened” by the DCR’s decision.
Cassa, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor, said in an interview that the concerns about traffic backups from residents who live in neighborhoods affected by the traffic closures “need to be respected.”
“We really hoped some sort of study or mitigation would have been done to fix those issues and address the issues so that we can actually make sure that we enjoy the open space for people, but also make it better for residents who had concerns,” he said.
Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor, said the DCR’s decision was “frustrating” because there is a “vast amount of community support for the space.”
“The fact that the DCR did this without a real public process where residents could come and talk about the concerns, talk about how great the open space is — that was really disappointing to me,” he said.
Lawrence added the rally’s purpose is to “urge the DCR to reverse this decision.”
“If this rally doesn’t convince the DCR to change its decision, I think we will definitely be seeing a lot more action, but I’m confident that this will be a demonstration that shows that support,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean Francis J. Doyle III prepares to depart from Harvard after eight years at the school, SEAS professors reflected on his tenure and voiced preferences for a successor who builds on his key initiatives.
Doyle, previously a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, became SEAS’ top leader in 2015. As dean, Doyle oversaw the historic move of two-thirds of the SEAS faculty to a new campus in Allston, a project that was announced in 2014 and cost $1 billion.
In December, Harvard announced that Doyle would depart from Harvard to become the provost at Brown University. Two months later, Harvard President-elect Claudine Gay kicked off the search for Doyle’s successor.
Several faculty members said they want a SEAS dean who has both an administrative and academic background — similar to Doyle.
“We don’t need just an administrator,” said Federico Capasso, a professor of Applied Physics and a scientist at Bell Laboratories before joining Harvard in 2003. “That would be a mistake.”
“Administrators have a great job to do, but they should not tell the faculty what to do,” he added. “So I’m really adamant that the next dean should be a top scholar.”
David A. Weitz, professor of Physics and of Applied Physics, also said he believes the next dean should be a scholar.
“You need somebody who is a strong person and my experience is people who are administrators don’t have the strength of being able to project things,” he said. “People who are good scientists tend to be better suited for the kind of leadership you need.”
“We have a lot of administrators,” he added. “We need some leaders.”
David C. Bell, a professor of the practice of electron microscopy who serves as associate director of the Center for Nanoscale Systems, praised Doyle’s leadership at a time of transition for the school. According to Bell, the faculty was torn between those who “didn’t like the idea of splitting up SEAS” and those who were “very enthusiastic about going into a new building.”
“I think the one important thing that Frank did that hadn’t been done prior to his arrival was he got everybody involved and had multiple meetings about Allston and multiple meetings with the faculty about how things were going to develop and how things were going to evolve,” Bell said in a February interview.
“He was a diplomat as well as being very approachable,” he added “You could bring him problems — whether he’d fix them or not, is a different thing. But you could bring him issues or concerns that you had and he would try to help you out.”
Capasso said he was initially “skeptical” about the move to Allston but was ultimately satisfied with Doyle’s management.
“At the end, you have to look for the results,” Capasso said. “I know that people who moved to Allston are very happy with it.”
Jonathan E. Frankle, an incoming assistant professor of Computer Science, said Doyle was a “big part of the reason” why he joined Harvard.
Frankle, who is currently chief scientist at artificial intelligence startup MosaicML, said he had worked with Doyle to advocate for the funding of the Kempner Institute for the Study of Artificial and Natural Intelligence. Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan ’07 pledged $500 million to found the Kempner Institute in December 2021.
SEAS “is an exciting place for great research,” Frankle said.
“It’s a place that’s growing,” he added. “It’s a place that’s tightly integrated with everything else Harvard has to offer.”
“I think Dean Doyle had a big hand in that forward-leaning, that energy, that ambition that Harvard engineering has,” Frankle said.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Senior Harvard administrators did not agree to the demands of Black student leaders during an hourlong conversation Friday about the University’s response to the Leverett House “swatting” attack but pledged to meet with the students again, according to three people at the meeting.
The Friday meeting at Massachusetts Hall came one week after Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow agreed to meet with Black student leaders about the April 3 swatting attack, during which four Black undergraduates were ordered out of their rooms at gunpoint by Harvard University Police Department officers responding to a false 911 call.
Dozens of Black student organizations penned a letter to University administrators late last month with a list of demands, threatening to stage a demonstration during Visitas — the College’s admitted students weekend — if the University did not respond to the letter’s demands by then.
The open letter contained five demands, including calls for administrators to issue a University-wide statement about the “swatting” attack, host a town hall with senior Harvard leaders, and implement “proactive mental health responses” for the affected students.
Eight student representatives — five undergraduates and three graduate students — attended the meeting with top University administrators, including Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay.
Harvard Black Students Association President Angie Gabeau ’25 said in a Sunday interview that she was a “little disappointed in the fact that none of the demands were really met.”
“It was kind of more just a, ‘We’ll have another meeting to talk about it more,’” said Gabeau, a Crimson Editorial editor. “But hopefully meetings in the future will be more successful in terms of meeting that demand.”
Black Community Leaders Co-Chair Brian A. Cromwell Jr. ’23 — who helped draft the initial open letter — wrote in a statement on Sunday that “the conversation was productive.”
“The administration was receptive to our demands and acknowledged that the situation should have been handled better,” Cromwell wrote. “Though we were not able to flesh out everything within the hour long time frame I believe that the administration will continue this conversation with the Black Community.”
Waving signs and banners, more than 50 Harvard students rallied outside Mass. Hall in a demonstration of solidarity with the students inside speaking with administrators.
Prince A. Williams ’25, one of the eight student representatives who met with administrators, highlighted the importance of activism in an address to the rally’s attendees before the start of the meeting with Bacow.
“Look at what the threat of Black organization did,” said Williams, a Crimson Editorial editor. “The threat of Black organization got us a seat at the president’s table.”
After the meeting, Williams said administrators acknowledged they could have done better.
“We pressed them the whole meeting to actually come up with some material ways to address what we’ve been asking for,” Williams said. “They’re still trying to dodge us, they do what a lot of administrators do in these types of meetings, which is to say ‘We support you, we hear you.’”
“We’re looking for more than that,” he added. “We’re looking for deeper conversations.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard administrators were “grateful for the important opportunity Friday to hear from and discuss the concerns raised by students.”
“As is the case in any public safety incident on campus, University and HUPD leaders are continuing to review our response and working to identify lessons to be learned and ways to improve our engagement with the community moving forward,” he wrote. “Friday’s conversation was an important part of those ongoing considerations and University leaders are committed to further opportunities for community dialogue.”
Following the conclusion of the meeting, Bacow quickly exited Mass. Hall through a side door, followed by a member of his staff. The two men left Harvard Yard through Johnston Gate and entered a waiting vehicle outside. Demonstrators noticed Bacow’s fast departure and attempted to follow him through the gate, but he entered the vehicle without interacting with the students.
Demonstrators outside recited call-and-response chants including “Black Lives Matter” and “This is what community looks like” as they marched around the building.
Student organizers also took to the steps of Mass. Hall to address the crowd, with calls of “shame” interspersed throughout their speeches.
BSA Special Events Chair Jonathan Haileselassie ’26 said in a speech at the demonstration that Harvard, “as a corporation, first and foremost will always put the pursuit of profits over the prosperity of its people.”
“Harvard would rather divest from the very food that we eat than from the police that make us feel uncomfortable at every juncture and harass our unhoused neighbors in the broader community,” he said.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on student criticisms of HUPD during the Friday rally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jonathan Huang ’26 was appointed the lone undergraduate representative on the Harvard University Police Department Advisory Board at a meeting Monday, following nearly a year without a Harvard College student member.
The board, which provides oversight and recommendations for Harvard’s campus police force, has been without undergraduate representation since Noah A. Harris ’22 graduated last May. Harris, who was president of the now-defunct Harvard Undergraduate Council, was the board’s sole undergraduate representative prior to his graduation.
Huang was appointed to a two-year term set to expire in June 2025 along with two other new members — Mary T. Bassett ’74, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, and Taylor C. McGuire, a Ph.D. candidate in Psychology at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
The new members are joining the 12-member board with representatives including students, faculty, and administrators from across the University.
Huang wrote in an emailed statement that he was “honored” to join the board.
“As a part of the Board, my goal is to help form a bridge of communication between the students and HUPD, thus making sure that all comments and concerns are properly voiced,” he wrote. “Although I am serving as the sole undergraduate representative, I am grateful to have the opportunity to represent and respond to all of the opinions, thoughts, and needs of the students in the College.”
The department has faced heightened scrutiny this semester in the wake of two high-profile incidents.
On April 3, four Black undergraduates in Leverett House were ordered out of their rooms at gunpoint by HUPD officers responding to a false 911 call from an individual claiming to be armed and holding a woman hostage.
The University’s response sparked a wave of student and alumni outrage, with many criticizing the delay in an official statement from Harvard’s administration, which came around 66 hours after the police entered the dorm.
After the police raid, 45 Harvard organizations co-signed a letter to administrators with demands related to “Harvard’s handling of issues of racial policing and HUPD protocol.” Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow, President-elect Claudine Gay, and HUPD Chief Victor A. Clay met with eight Black student group leaders Friday amid a student rally in support of the letter’s demands.
Huang wrote that the board has “been getting updates and having important discussions” on the swatting attack at Leverett and the ongoing investigation.
Huang added that members of the Advisory Board were also briefed on a potential bomb threat due to a suspicious package that was later deemed safe. The mid-April incident caused the evacuation of Harvard’s Science Center Plaza and parts of the neighboring Science Center.
The Advisory Board is also still actively working with the department on its pending update to the HUPD workload and crime dashboard, according to Huang.
Earlier this month, board member Osiris Rankin told The Crimson that members of the board discussed a newer version of the dashboard with HUPD outside of regularly scheduled meetings.
The workload and crime dashboard has not been updated since June 2021.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discussed growing nuclear threats from North Korea at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Friday evening, capping off his six-day visit to the United States.
The event, moderated by former Harvard Kennedy School Dean and professor emeritus Joseph S. Nye Jr., came two days after President Joe Biden and Yoon announced the “Washington Declaration” — a move aimed to strengthen ties between the U.S. and South Korea in the face of North Korea’s recent nuclear tests.
The declaration gives South Korea a strategic role in a potential American nuclear strategy against North Korea, in exchange for South Korea not acquiring its own nuclear arsenal.
“President Biden and I adopted a joint statement on the vision of an alliance and action toward the future,” Yoon said through a translator. “The alliance is not a contract of convenience that comes and goes based on interests. But it is a valued alliance that is based on the universal value of freedom and democracy.”
The declaration has sparked criticism from some government officials in South Korea who argue the agreement will harm the country’s security interests.
“There is some opinion in our Korean society that due to increasing nuclear threats posed by North Korea, that we need to acquire our own nuclear weapons,” Yoon said.
Yoon defended his decision to sign on to the declaration during the forum, arguing South Korea would run contrary to its values if it decided to develop its own nuclear weapons.
“I believe those opinions saying we need to have our own nuclear arsenal are not considering all these factors,” he added.
Prior to the event, protesters gathered at the entrance to John F. Kennedy Memorial Park — located right outside the forum’s venue — holding signs that read “Traitor Yoon,” “U.S. Military Puppet,” and “No To War! Yes To Peace!” among other messages.
The protest, which lasted throughout the forum until Yoon left the HKS campus, was organized by the New England Korea Peace Campaign, Boston Candlelight Action Committee, and Massachusetts Peace Action.
Seung Hee Jeon, co-chair of the Korean Peace Campaign and associate professor at Boston College, said in an interview that the group organized the protest to “urge U.S. government and Biden administration to stop supporting and encouraging this extremely unpopular and extremely authoritarian Yoon government.”
“Yoon’s administration, since its inauguration about a year ago, has been undermining decades of efforts by the people of South Korea to create more stable democracy, lasting peace, and universal justice,” Jeon said.
“The administration has been expanding dangerous and provocative U.S.-South Korea military exercises, heightening tensions with North Korea, rolling back workers rights, threatening to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality, and ruthlessly suppressing the freedom of the press,” she added.
A spokesperson for the South Korean president, Sehee An, did not respond to a request for comment.
The agreement between Biden and Yoon drew complaints from China, which expressed “strong dissatisfaction” over the agreement’s language surrounding stability in the Taiwan Strait.
Asked by Nye whether the declaration will worsen tensions between the two nations, Yoon maintained the agreement was designed to counter nuclear threats from North Korea.
“When it comes to a relationship with China, everything is based on mutual respect and we pursue mutual interests and co-prosperity,” he said. “The Washington Declaration that you just mentioned has to do with intensifying nuclear threats coming from North Korea.”
“I think this kind of choice that we made under the Washington Declaration is an inevitable one on our part,” Yoon added.

With warmer weather comes more sneezing and sniffling in sections. As we enter pollen season, here are some tips to help you with your allergies.
Carry pocket tissues 
Having a runny nose? Can’t stop sneezing? Instead of blowing your nose with the HUDS paper napkins, run to CVS and get a pack of pocket tissues. Using soft tissues can also prevent you from getting a red chapped nose. Put them in your bag and pockets so you’ll never have to be the person that wipes their nose with their sleeves again!
Drink herbal tea 
Drinking hot herbal tea with some honey can relieve your sore throat and decongest your sinuses. Some of my personal favorites are apple cinnamon, lemon with ginger, and peppermint. Steal some Bigelow tea bags from the Math Lounge or the Northwest Building for a relaxing tea time. Take your sickness as an opportunity to wave goodbye to three lattes a day and start your cozy tea-girl era.
Make Vitamin C your best friend 
Your mom probably told you this already, but Vitamin C should be your go-to. Smuggle some oranges and kiwis from the dining hall or run to CVS to buy an overpriced box of Emergen-C powders. The immune system boost will not only help cope with your spring allergies but make you more resistant to sickness (you no longer have to go to Tasty Basty in fear of catching something from a sweaty stranger).
Wear sunglasses 
The weather is getting warmer, so rock your sunglasses while walking in the yard. Sunglasses are not only a sleek addition to your outfit, but also block pollen, dust, and wind from getting into your eyes. Red, swollen eyes featured in your candid picnic photos are NOT a cute look.
Become a hermit 
If none of these work for you, the last resort might be to just become a hermit. Clean your room and close all your windows to avoid any contact with outside air. Maybe invest in a humidifier. Dig your fuzzy pajamas out from the pile of winter clothes under your bed and use some essential oils for a self-care night. It would definitely be more fun than catching the frat flu before finals week.
Follow these tips to enjoy yard picnics and walks along the river without sneezing and wheezing. If none of these works for you, HUHS might be your destination.
