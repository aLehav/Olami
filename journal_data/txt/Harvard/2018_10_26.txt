After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Films that focus on issues within the LGBTQ+ community face a unique conundrum in which the topics that are the most politically pertinent also center on the darkest themes. Queer fans, in particular, are then torn between the desire to see people like themselves get happy endings, and the desire to show the world the harsh realities they face. Although there are romantic comedies like “Love, Simon,” there are also somber dramas like “Brokeback Mountain.” “Boy Erased” certainly falls into the latter category. Aside from one awkward joke about misspelling “God” as “Dog,” director Joel Edgerton brings almost nothing to the table in terms of heartfelt moments or comic relief. Instead, Edgerton confronts viewers with a harsh reality, one that he does not sugarcoat or beautify simply to make it more palatable. Films like this almost invariably provide commentary on issues that persist today — in this case, the continued presence of gay conversion camps — and have the ultimate intention of stirring emotions that should ultimately lead to political action, rather than entertaining. Though its impact certainly falls short of a first person account of such tragic events, Edgerton succeeds in providing unforgettable insights into the relationship between Christianity, homophobia, and the mental health of queer youth.
“I wish this had never happened. But sometimes I thank God that it did.” These words, the first spoken by the film’s protagonist Jared (Lucas Hedges), hint at the many directions in which he will be pulled by his sexuality and the attitudes of those around him. The film begins in medias res, as a college-age Jared endures his first day at a Christian conversion therapy camp. Through several flashbacks, Edgerton conveys the series of events that led to Jared being sent there, including two relationships he had with men in the past, as well as his coming out to his conservative parents. Meanwhile, at the camp, Jared and other boys like him withstand both emotional and physical abuse in the name of repressing their “sinful” feelings. As the days go by, this abuse worsens and intensifies, forcing Jared’s mother (Nicole Kidman) to make a decision over what she values most: her church’s teachings on the “sinful” nature of homosexuality, or the wellbeing of her only son.
In addition to the parent-son relationship, Edgerton takes a risk by delving into the one of the most complex relationships depicted in this film, and other films of its type: that between Christianity and homosexuality. This risk pays off, thanks to Edgerton’s multifaceted consideration of the issue. First and foremost, the two are pitted against each other. The various acts of homophobia that Jared encounters stem largely from someone’s intense religious beliefs. For example, in a poignant scene in which Jared’s position at the table during a family prayer evokes Judas in da Vinci's “The Last Supper,” the cinematography belies the family’s belief that homosexuality entails the betrayal of God. This exemplifies the continued tension between Christianity and homosexuality.
This tension is a staple theme of LGBTQ+ films, yet one that Edgerton complicates further. Edgerton’s depiction of specific individuals of Christian faith, as opposed to the religion itself, as the perpetrators of homophobia is what makes this film go beyond mere criticism of a group. As a core Christian value, compassion ought to lead to the acceptance of homosexuality, yet Edgerton shows the way in which the value can be insidiously misused. The extreme contrast between the conditions at the camp and the intentions of those running it exemplifies this, as the counselors at the camp use compassion to justify the emotional manipulation of those attending. Along the lines of the oft-quoted “Love the sinner, not the sin” philosophy, the leaders at the camp continually emphasize the fact that the attendees are good people at heart who have simply made sinful mistakes in the past. “I am using sexual sin and homosexuality to fill a God-shaped hole in my life,” the attendees are made to recite when they first arrive. “But I’m not broken, and God still loves me.”
Perhaps most hopeful, in the depressing context of Christianity misrepresented as a tool for homophobia, is the indication that Christianity and homosexuality can live on hand in hand. Prior to being sent to the camp, Jared meets with a medical professional (Cherry Jones) to get his testosterone levels tested. In one of the more wholesome scenes in the movie, she tells Jared that as both a Christian and a doctor who holds “science in one hand, and God in the other,” she believes that he is “a perfectly normal, very healthy teenage boy.” This effectively positions the film as a call for unity that relies on inspiration rather than defamation in order to combat the suffering of a marginalized group.
Despite these insights, the weakest parts of the film come from its inability to access Jared’s thoughts, thus failing to provide a first person account of events. In many ways, the ability to understand exactly how someone feels when facing oppression is the most effective tool in creating the empathy necessary to inspire political action. Although Edgerton captures Jared’s outward emotions via dialogue, his quiet demeanor and the lack of narration mean that his interiority still hovers slightly out of reach.
Still, the film does manage to make a splash in its own ways. The film medium provides the ability to add additional layers that bolster the storytelling. Namely, the riveting Troye Sivan-centered soundtrack, in addition to carrying the emotional lived experience of a queer artist, adds an auditory component that represents the film’s themes. “Revelation,” the end credits song, still resonates even after exiting the theater.
The conversion therapy issue is one that is, unfortunately, still in discussion today, particular in relation to Vice President Mike Pence’s endorsement of treatment for people “seeking to change their sexual behavior.” As Americans debate the intentions of politicians like Pence, this film shows that, no matter the intentions, these conversion therapy camps can have devastating effects on the wellbeing of the LGBTQ+ community. Overall, these factors makes “Boy Erased” a worthwhile emotional experience that examines the systematic and misunderstood oppressions that queer people face in America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hey! How are you?! It’s been so long since I’ve seen you! Why didn’t we ever end up grabbing that meal? Tell me, how have you been? Oh, I totally feel you, midterm season is brutal.
Wait! Before you head out, do you mind if I ask you something?
Awesome! So, I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I’m very passionate about making Harvard a better place, and recently I’ve been thinking about taking that to the next level. In fact, I’ve decided to make the ultimate sacrifice a student leader in the Harvard community can make. Yes, I already spend tons of hours each week (at least two!) devoting myself to the student body of Harvard College, but now I’m ready to commit myself even further.
I know what you’re thinking. I already do so much, how could I do even more? You’ve seen me posting on Facebook about how hard it is to perform the emotional labor that comes with being a student activist. (Hosting one or two town halls about pressing campus issues really takes so much out of you!) And I constantly talk about the change that I have single-handedly implemented here at the College (change that of course was the result of only my own hard work, not that of students and administrators who had these goals for decades prior to my arrival at Harvard.)
But I know I can do more — so here I am. I’m running for president.
I’m doing this for you — I care about you so much, and you have no idea how much I want to help you, and how much I want to advocate for you, and how much I want to change your life. I promise this is not about my resume — why would I want that?
(Also, was it your birthday last week? I saw your Insta post; you looked gorgeous as always!)
You and I both know that Harvard needs to change. But you should also know that I am the person who will bring that change. Yes, countless students have come before me advocating for reform, like improving social life and mental health care. Yes, none of them were able to achieve their visions. And yes, I’m going to be different — If you want to know why, just check my website and let yourself be seduced by the music video and cute infographics on there! And while you’re at it, why don’t you also sign the petition I started to bring back Harvard Time? (Because once the administration knows what students want, they will definitely give it to us.)
Oh! You’re wondering whether I will advocate for reversing the final club sanctions? That’s a tricky question. Of course I want all students to feel welcome on campus and have a social space here. I mean I really want all students, regardless of gender or socioeconomic status, to feel like Harvard is a home for them, you know? And I hope we can build Harvard to be a place where no one feels excluded, but also a place where people can associate with whoever they want. Does that answer your question?
To build off of that, my goal is to represent the entire student body. That’s why I’ve been doing so much outreach to minority student groups and cultural organizations — to include everyone, not to collect votes. Of course, I don’t always actually support the policies these groups ask me to support, but that’s just politics, it’s not personal. Because I’m representing everyone, that does mean that sometimes I can’t advocate for every group’s specific needs. But don’t worry! Just because I’m not voting the way I’m telling you I’m voting doesn’t mean I won’t fulfill all my campaign promises once you elect me.
I know you might be thinking that I’m the same old candidate who shows up every year begging for your vote. I know that’s annoying. But I’m different. You know me. I mean, we’ve never had more than a basic, superficial conversation every few months or so, and I might not know what your concentration is, or where you’re from, or even your last name — but never mind all that. Every time I see you I scream and hug you and act like I’m your best friend, and that has to count for something, right? We’ve been close like that since Opening Days, and of course that’s never had anything to do with my plans to run for this position. It’s all about you! You’re super important to me, so your vote would just mean so, so much to me.
Okay, I know you have to go, but let me say just one last thing. I’ve heard there are crazy rumors going around about me and my vice-president. Elections can get rough, but honestly it makes me so sad that some people try to play dirty to win. I mean, all I want is for the best person to win, and I don’t even understand how anyone could do that, but —
But listen, listen! — I think you should know that even though the other candidates act like they’re so clean, their entire campaign has actually been really messed up. I don’t want to spread gossip or anything, but I have it on good authority they’ve been breaking the campaigning rules. I’ve even heard that they’re forcing people to vote for them! Again, I don’t want to spread any rumors, I’m staying above all that, but I think you should know. Just so you can make an informed decision, right?
Alright, then — thank you so much for hearing me out! I really do hope you’re on board. I’m honestly just so passionate about this campaign and about doing all I can for Harvard — and for you, of course! Really, that line on my resume and the spiel I’ve already prepared to give recruiters and graduate school admissions is just the cherry on top. Really, I don’t think about any of that at all.
And let’s grab that meal sometime!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my first year, I stepped foot onto campus as a pre-med student. My conviction was as steadfast as Harvard’s old brick walls, as concrete as the cheerful chairs wedged permanently into the lawns of Harvard Yard. Sophomore year, however, I moved into my dorm with absolutely no idea of who I was or what I wanted to do. Perhaps my uncertainty developed over the summer, or maybe even all the way back in the winter around the time I first learned that the chairs in the Yard don’t sit there forever. I was left with no sense of direction — which is precisely how one finds themselves walking on the well-trodden path of consulting.
Not knowing what you want to do is terrifying, especially at a place like Harvard where everyone seems to have crawled out of the womb with a ten-year plan. Contrary to the passionate and invigorated energy I expected when I first arrived, many students decide their futures based on the necessity of deciding “something.” Looking back, I realize that even I settled on a pre-med path simply because science was all that I was exposed to, so it just made sense to keep going. I kept going until the day I stopped to ask myself “Why?” and couldn’t find an answer.
This mentality pervades campus culture and compels students to resort to safer paths rather than pursuing genuine interests, a risk that no one can seem to take. Indecisive about your career? Try consulting for a few years until you figure it out. No longer pre-med and suddenly faced with the pressure to decide a new career? No problem; just slide into the recruiting train. It’s what everyone is doing, after all. Consulting has become the new “I don’t know” in response to the big question of the future, essentially replacing the fear of the unknown with the security of a dispassionate job.
It is astounding to me that Harvard, a liberal arts institution that supposedly prides itself on a fulfilling education for the intellectually curious, also acts as a pipeline directly into the corporate sector of finance and consulting. What purpose do these classes about reforming education (United States and the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education” — a must-take) or analyzing great works of literature serve if students turn them away for yet another Economics requirement or gems used for scheduled nap times?
In any college or university, but especially within our own brick walls, it’s either pre-med, pre-law, tech, consulting, or finance. Anything else is met with raised eyebrows or “good luck getting a job with that.” Why must anyone be pre-anything? Rather than appreciating college for the rare opportunity to learn whatever we want and to experiment in new fields, we have grown to view this extraordinary institution as a mere stepping stone for a career, a mandatory prerequisite for monetary gratification, and yet another checkbox on the to-do list for a six-figure salary.
Of course, I recognize the legitimate motivations behind secure pre-professional paths. Coming from a humble background, I completely empathize with the high stakes of attaining financial security upon graduation, and indeed, it can be scary not having an answer when someone inquires about your post-graduation plans. However, a six-figure salary is not necessary to lead a fulfilling, financially secure lifestyle. In a society where your career can easily become your life, your paychecks won’t buy you happiness, especially not with a job you hate.
If the sole purpose of Harvard were to shuttle students from high school to a job, then it would call itself a trade school (which is a perfectly valid path post-12th grade). But Harvard isn’t a trade school, so why must we treat it like one? Campus culture is its own being, and while Harvard has definitely played a part in enabling the pre-professional tunnel vision that pervades the student body, that doesn’t mean that we aren’t to blame as well. Every action is preceded by a decision, and every decision is preceded by a thought. Each of us has autonomy over where we choose to take our lives despite the countless career fairs and networking events that may make us feel otherwise.
Then, what can an indecisive college student anxious about the future do? I ask that you don’t be afraid to be afraid. Take that class even though it has no professional relevance to you — take it because you want to and because now is the only time. Join a club for fun rather than just for networking in “x” or experience for “y.” After extensive talks with career advisers, friends, and most importantly, myself, the greatest takeaway I have learned is to be genuine in all that you do, and you will figure things out. The objective of the game is not to come out with a salary; rather, it is to come out with better character, a learned mind, and growth. Coming from Harvard, a career will inevitably follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In past weeks, some Harvard administrators have admonished the many students who have taken to house email lists in order to sell their tickets to the Harvard-Yale football game. Selling student tickets has always been prohibited by the University, but in years past the rule has not been strictly enforced. This year, likely due to the increased number of students in the market, at least one House administrator has gone as far as threatening referral to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct for the practice.
Official rules aside, we believe that the administration should continue the leniency it has shown in past years. Not only are students exercising a right to sell their tickets in a free market and therein expressing a well-founded frustration at the relocation of The Game to Fenway Park, but the threat of administrative discipline is out of proportion with the nature of the infraction.
As we have previously stated, the University has changed The Game for the worse in many ways. It became far more difficult to obtain a ticket near one’s friends due to the requirement that, in order to do so, one had to go with all of one’s friends to get tickets at the same time. There are also only two locations for Harvard students to pick up tickets — one of which is across the river. The Game has been entirely drained of its social joy. Many Harvard students, as a result, will likely choose not to go to Fenway.
In short, it is the University’s own fault that The Game is less enticing to attend, and that students are consequently selling their tickets. The University should thus not punish students for selling tickets to a game that has been ruined for students by the University itself. Indeed, if Harvard students want to sell their tickets and other people (likely other students and their relatives) want to buy those tickets, the University should let them go about that interaction without the threat of disciplinary action.
Furthermore, the punishment of referring students to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct for selling their tickets to The Game is disproportionate to the infraction committed. Selling a ticket to a school football game does not a merit a formal referral to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct.
Indeed, if the University had kept The Game the way it was before, the number of students selling their tickets would be far smaller. University administration should not be surprised that students are selling their tickets and complain when it caused the problem in the first place.
Instead, the University should let the market regulate itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After seven months of negotiations, Harvard and its largest union reached a tentative agreement on a new contract Thursday morning.
The union — the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers — represents around 5,100 Harvard employees who primarily work in libraries, labs, and faculty offices. The agreement, which replaces a contract that expired nearly a month ago, will be binding for the next three years.
The union’s previous contract became obsolete on Sept. 30. Between then and now, the University and the union — the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers — agreed to continue providing benefits under the last contract to members, though members experienced delays in receiving raises that union leaders said would likely come with a new agreement. The previous agreement will continue until at least Dec. 4, when union members will vote to ratify Thursday’s contract. If that referendum passes, union members will receive a lump sum bonus equal to the amount they would have earned if they had won raises on Sept. 30.
In an email to members Thursday, union leadership wrote that the raises included in the contract marked a success. According to the email, members who have been employed by the union for one year will receive a 3.8 percent raise the day the contract takes effect. In the second and third years of the contract, “the average member” will see their pay rise by 3.5 percent each year.
In a joint statement, leaders of HUCTW and University representatives wrote that, in addition to ensuring annual pay increases, the agreement improves upon “a number of policy issues of mutual interest to the Union and the University.”
“The Tentative Agreement represents a commitment to fairness on the part of both parties and recognizes the important role HUCTW members play in the success of the Harvard community,” the statement reads.
These policy issues include the University’s use of contingent workers — temps and workers who are employed less than 17.5 hours per week. The use and classification of these workers has been a point of contention between Harvard and HUCTW throughout negotiations.
In a September interview, HUCTW President Carrie Barbash explained that, in many cases, these workers are hired in accordance with HUCTW’s current contract policy, which states that temporary employees can only be hired for a maximum of three months. Other times, however, the employees are kept in temporary positions for extended periods of time without Harvard granting them full employee status. This prevents them from joining the union and receiving benefits, a situation that worried Barbash and the union negotiators.
In the contract, the University and the union agreed to institute “stronger policies and enforcement mechanisms” to prevent the “inappropriate use” of contingent workers, union leadership wrote in their email to members.
Simone R. Gonzalez ’13 — a HUCTW negotiator and Harvard Business School employee whose focus on the bargaining team revolved around these workers — said she was happy with the “substantive policies” the union and the University reached.
“A really important HUCTW principle ... is the idea that that people coming onto the campus every day and doing regular Harvard work on a regular basis should have the benefits of regular employees,” Gonzalez said.
In the lead-up to the ratification vote, union leadership plans to meet with members, hear their thoughts on the contract, and encourage them to vote to ratify it, Barbash said.
“HUCTW negotiators, Executive Board members, officers, and organizers enthusiastically recommend a ‘Yes’ vote to approve the new contract,” union leaders wrote in the email to members. “We’re looking forward to discussing the details with you and hearing all of your ideas, questions, and concerns over the next few weeks.”
Correction: Oct. 26, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Simone R. Gonzalez '13 is a Harvard Medical School employee. In fact, she is a Harvard Business School employee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of International Education’s student advisers shared their experiences studying abroad as people of color Thursday evening, gathering in Memorial Church for a casual mix-and-mingle event.
Over burritos and cinnamon bites, advisers eagerly told their study abroad stories, dispelled study abroad myths, and discussed their work at the OIE.
Jenna M. Gray ’19, an OIE student adviser, said she was inspired to put on this event after studying abroad as a person of color in Copenhagen, Denmark during spring of her junior year.
“When I applied for the student adviser position in the spring, something I was interested in working on was race and encouraging diversity abroad, addressing concerns people might have about not being around people who look like them and facing racism,” Gray said.
After Sadie C. Pate ’20, another student adviser, suggested organizing an OIE event centered around diversity, she and Gray reached out to other student cultural organizations to co-sponsor it.
South Asian Association secretary Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 said she was excited to co-sponsor the event, noting the inherent difficulties of being a student of color in a majority-white country.
“People are less used to seeing people of color in Europe versus in very diverse places like Massachusetts or California, where I’m from,” she said, describing her time abroad in Paris. “I had to adjust my mindset to understand the cultural differences and still be able to know that people are coming from a place of curiosity and good intent most of the time. It’s something that’s definitely a learning experience for both sides.”
According to Valerie B. Elefante ’19, an OIE student adviser who studied in Paris during her junior year, another one of the event’s primary objectives was to encourage students to leave the Harvard bubble and explore different learning experiences.
“We must utilize all of [our resources], including those that are not physically on Harvard’s campus, to take full advantage of the Harvard [experience],” Elefante said.
Elefante explained that many students are deterred from studying abroad during the school year due to fear of missing out on campus opportunities. The OIE estimated in 2014 that only 50-90 students studied abroad during term time, compared to the 400 that studied abroad during the summer.
“There’s always so much going on on campus that it’s hard to detach oneself from school, especially from extracurriculars,” Kemi E. Akenzua ’20, who attended the event, said.
Pate, an inactive Crimson magazine editor, encouraged students, however, to open themselves up to new opportunities, joking, “the most transformative experience I’ve had at Harvard was outside of Harvard.”
Admitting initial nervousness about studying abroad, Bryan G. Kim ’22 said he felt inspired after the event.
“I just want to keep a positive mindset and be able to have a good environment of respect in a study abroad program,” Kim said. “I think just interacting with people who haven’t dealt with people who are different from them is part of the study abroad experience.”
As a parting sentiment to students, event organizers encouraged them to not let their identity prevent them from taking full advantage of study abroad opportunities.
“There are people that have been through [study abroad] before that can talk to you about how that experience can be made easier,” Mahajan said.

Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics recently released a study claiming that panspermia, an astronomical theory that life is exchanged between planets within solar systems, can be expanded to support exchanging life within the Milky Way galaxy.
The study, “Galactic Panspermia,” concluded that life, or the chemical compounds necessary for life, can be distributed between solar systems or even galaxies by astronomical objects such as meteoroids or asteroids. The study was led by Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Theory and Computation Idan Ginsburg and co-authored by Astronomy Department chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb and ITC postdoctoral fellow Manasvi Lingam.
The theory of panspermia proposes a mechanism by which astronomical objects could feasibly transport life to other planets within solar systems. The presence of life could take the form of anything from chemical compounds to microorganisms.
The study, which expands the theory panspermia to interstellar transport, hinges on the probability of two factors: the rate at which solar systems capture life-bearing objects and the ability of life to survive the treacherous space conditions for extended periods of time.
Despite the findings in the study, the researchers said the panspermia phenomenon is still difficult to prove. Ginsburg described the slim chances of panspermia by using a model in which the sun was scaled down to the size of a basketball. In this scale, the earth would be the size of a grain of salt and sit 80 feet away.
“The nearest star to us would still be thousands of miles away in this super scaled down version,” he said. “Just to give you an idea of how difficult it is to transfer life...from one solar system to another.”
The researchers’ idea to look beyond the solar system for sources of life came from another cosmic event, according to Loeb.
“We considered the process of transfer of life across the galaxy and that was triggered – inspired – by the discovery of Oumuamua,” Loeb said.
Oumuamua, a rock 100-meters long, was the first interstellar object to be found in the solar system to originate from outside the solar system. Rocks, according to Lingam, had the potential to harbor hardy bacteria that could withstand heavy radiation and difficult cosmic conditions.
“Even a fairly small rock could serve as a pretty effective shield for these bacteria,” Lingam said. “Once [the bacteria] land on a given planet, they can proliferate pretty rapidly.”
Loeb, who is also working on the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, said that the next step for astronomers is to find more objects like Oumuamua crossing the solar system.
“Potentially, the next one or one of the future ones we could land on, and that would be interesting,” Loeb said. “If we find evidence for life on it, then the whole idea of panspermia would make much more sense.”
The study also brought into question the possibility of life beyond Earth’s solar system.
“I think it's silly to assume that we’re the only intelligent, technologically capable civilization in the galaxy, let alone the universe,” Ginsburg said.
The researchers acknowledged, however, that the study supports an unpopular view among the scientific community.
“People tend to have prejudice about what’s the likelihood of life as we know it elsewhere,” Loeb said. “A lot of people have a strong prejudice against technological life, advanced civilizations, whether they exist or not.”
“Galactic Panspermia” is currently under peer review for publication in the astronomy journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Twelve Harvard faculty members were elected to the National Academy of Medicine, considered one of the highest honors in health and medicine, on Oct. 15.
The 12 were among 75 “regular” members and 10 international members elected for their “outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service,” according to the Academy’s press release.
The elected professors — from various schools, including Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — are Richard S. Blumberg, Francesca Dominici, Benjamin L. Ebert, Evelynn M. Hammonds, Robert E. Kingston, Keith D. Lillemoe, Xihong Lin, Matthew L. Meyerson ’85, Charles A. Nelson III, Stuart L. Schreiber, Arlene Sharpe ’75, and Janey L. Wiggs.
“This distinguished and diverse class of new members is a truly remarkable set of scholars and leaders whose impressive work has advanced science, improved health, and made the world a better place for everyone,” President of the National Academy of Medicine Victor J. Dzau said in the press release.
Nelson, professor of pediatrics, neuroscience, and psychology, said he was surprised to learn of his election when he checked his email during a meeting in Toronto.
“I was so taken aback I came very close to blurting something out loud, like ‘oh my god,’ but then managed to bite my tongue,” he said.
Nelson said his research focuses on how brain development is impacted by adverse experiences, and he aims to use this knowledge to “develop interventions that can bring development back to even keel.”
“It’s enormously satisfying,” Dominici, a professor of biostatistics, population, and data science, said regarding her election.
Dominici’s research is about “developing and applying innovative statistical methods to understanding and reducing the impact of air pollution on population health,” with an aim to have “real impact in our government policy," she said.
Blumberg, a professor at the Medical School, said he was proud to have his group’s translational research recognized, but also hopes to have even greater impact in the medical field from his new position.
“We’ve been so successful in taking our fundamental ideas, based upon really great basic science, and bringing them forth into new drugs to treat diseases that have cut across a wide bunch of clinical barriers,” Blumberg said. “Now with the National Academy, maybe I can actually influence things in policy and guide things that I am passionate about in a different kind of way.”
Lin, a biostatistics professor at the School of Public Health, said the increased collaboration with members of the National Academy of Medicine will benefit her research.
She works on developing statistical and computational methods that can scale to analyze the massive amount of data in modern genetics and disease studies.
“I feel this will open new doors,” she said of her election. “I treasure the new opportunities to contribute to the National Academy of Medicine and … advance knowledge in biomedicine, public health policy, and health education so we can better tackle the emerging big problems in health.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. presidential candidate and attorney Ralph Nader spoke at the Harvard Law Forum Thursday to discuss the need for more public interest lawyers and his belief in Harvard Law School’s obligation to support public interest careers among its graduates.
Pete D. Davis ’12, the author of “The Bicentennial Crisis,” a book-length report that criticizes the Law School, joined Nader to speak in front of about a hundred people in the Law School’s Ames Courtroom in Austin Hall.
Introduced by Harvard Law Forum President Martin T. Drake, the speakers split the two-hour event to both critique the state of the legal profession in America and call current law students to serve the public.
Public service and its connection to the Law School has been an ongoing discussion over the past year. In February, Davis and four Law professors held a forum titled “Harvard Law and the Public Interest” to debate the school’s perceived disconnect with public service. Nader has been an active participant in the discussion as well — criticizing the Law School for its “corporate” focus at an event last year as well as in an open letter with six other alumni to Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 published in April.
At Thursday’s event, Davis enumerated the history of public interest law participation at the Law School and described his vision of a majority of Law graduates working in public interest careers. The proportion of graduates entering public service law positions stood at 16.87 percent among 2017 graduates.
“Does the mother getting evicted from their house care that we created a bunch of Supreme Court clerks?” Davis said. “Seen through the eyes of America, we risk irrelevance… When our grandkids ask what we did, we want to tell them we advanced the legal interest of the many rather than entrenched the power of the few.”
Davis pointed to the discrepancy between the proportion of students who enter the Law School wanting to work in the public interest and those who graduate with a job doing so.
“Something is changing you while you’re here,” Davis said.
Following Davis, Nader first spoke about lawyers’ need to promote of the rule of law to defend justice. Nader accused the Law School of failing to promote justice in its practices, instead producing graduates who bend to corporate interests.
“We definitely need you, for without the law, what is there? Without the law, there’s no justice. Without justice, there’s no liberty, there’s no freedom, there’s no suppression of violence, which is everywhere–– domestically, locally, nationally, internationally,” he said. “Harvard Law School has led the suppressing [of] the styles of violence that come from the rich of powerful and making you think that most of it comes from street crime and domestic crime.”
Law School spokespeople were not immediately available to respond to request for comment late Thursday evening.
Nader finally called on the listening law students to enter public service themselves, encourage others to do so, and advocate for change at the Law School to emphasize public interest.
“I ask you to liberate your minds and your imagination and have a high expectation of yourself,” he said. “If we don’t redistribute the deployment of lawyers in this country from favoring the few to the control of the many, our profession deserves its ranking in the polls year after year.”
Katherine J. Thoreson, a third-year law student and editor-in-chief of the Harvard Law Record, said she has worked with Nader before. In addition to being a former editor-in-chief of the publication, he still publishes contributing opinion articles.
“He’s just been a very supportive voice in the work that The Record does,” Thoreson said. “I think that he made a lot of salient points about the failures of this institution as well as the power that this institution has to change some of the problems in the legal landscape.”
Laurel A. Petrulionis said she was "inspired" by the end.
“I came to law school to make a difference in the world, and through orientation the student government really pushed this notion of challenging the corporate pull,” Laurel A. Petrulionis said. “I’m actually lucky that I’m getting a lot of these paradigms challenged in my 1L curriculum but it’s something that’s going to take a critical mass, and I’m inspired to see that there’s a movement happening right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Candidates girding for Undergraduate Council presidential elections often prep by scanning UC records and bylaws online and by sending questions to the Council’s election commission, an independent body tasked with overseeing the process.
But, over the past month, some UC presidential and vice presidential hopefuls say they have been unable to use either resource. The Council’s website remained largely devoid of content from September until Thursday, when The Crimson contacted UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 for comment about the site, prompting him to update the page.
The commission, meanwhile, has operated since the spring with only one member instead of the five mandated by the Council’s constitution. At its Sunday meeting last week, the UC added four new members to the committee.
Jubin Gorji ’21, chair of the election commission, said as the commission’s sole staffer, he struggled to respond to the flood of emails candidates began sending as presidential election season hit. Voting for this year’s election will take place from Nov. 12 to Nov. 15.
Gorji said he sometimes saw as many as 20 to 30 emails a day. He admitted his response time was often longer than he would have liked.
Multiple candidates said limited access to the Council’s website and its election commission meant they were unable to quickly obtain vital guidance such as election rules. The candidates declined to speak on the record because, per Council policy, they are not allowed to talk to the press before campaign season officially kicks off on Nov. 7.
One candidate called the struggle to find necessary information a “goose chase.”
That chase may soon end. With the commission now fully staffed, Gorji said the body will be able to respond to inquiries “within 24 hours” going forward.
And, around midday Thursday, things began looking up on the website front too.
Since September, the site consisted of two pages filled with two pictures of Council members and a few links to information about finance committee grants. It also boasted a notice declaring it was “undergoing maintenance.”
The webpage did not list Council records, its constitution, or information about UC sub-committees.
After being contacted by The Crimson Thursday, Boucher and his team began to populate the site.
“I had my team publish more content this morning and the site is back to the content it had before the server changes,” Boucher wrote in a text message, referring to a one-day server update Harvard University Information Technology performed on the UC website in mid-September.
Boucher disputed the notion that the site was ever non-functional.
“It’s not down, it’s under maintenance — the basic information such as grants and a variety of other directly linked pages are there,” he wrote. “One of our campaign promises was to deliver a better website, and doing so required rebuilding everything that was there which has been a process underway over the last few weeks.”
Boucher and UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 campaigned on a platform in Fall 2017 that promised students a revamped website. The duo at the time said a better site would allow the UC to increase student awareness of Harvard resources.
The Council launched the updated website in May 2018, but it remained under renovation throughout much of the spring and virtually all of the summer.
Boucher wrote the website remained down throughout June, July, and August so its “underlying server” could be upgraded with “cybersecurity enhancements.”

Students, faculty, and researchers from Harvard and other institutions gathered Thursday at the Harvard Art Museums for the 2018 Humanitarian Action Summit hosted by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.
With the stated aim of “shaping the future of humanitarian protection,” the summit included a keynote address on civilian and data protection by Yves Daccord, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
After Daccord’s address, five speakers gave short “Ted Talk” style presentations on the theme of protection, with topics ranging from ebola and drones to toxicology. Speakers included senior leaders in humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC, the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the HHI.
Established in 2005, the HHI is a University-wide academic and research program in humanitarian crisis and leadership, aimed at bringing together field experts, students, and faculty. Currently, 36 faculty collaborators, 16 research fellows, and a network of undergraduate and graduate students make up the initiative.
In his welcome address, initiative director and Harvard Medical School Professor Michael J. VanRooyen emphasized the significance of the summit.
“Usually we bring Harvard to the world; in this case we’re bringing the world to Harvard,” VanRooyen said.
Noor Zanial, a graduate student at the School of Public Health, said she was interested in attending the summit because “a lot of the work that Harvard Humanitarian Initiative does is very relevant to my interests.”
Attendees said they were impressed by the variety of speakers and topics addressed.
“It was really nice to see how up to date they were in terms of how to deal with these conflicts and the work that needs to be done,” Zanial said.
Sarah Klem, also a student at the School of Public Health, said she similarly appreciated the range of speakers’ points of view.
“I like that there was people with a deep breadth of experience. It makes people seem more legit in that way,” Klem said.
Many attendees were highly conscious of staying informed in order to better mobilize their local communities. When asked about the best way to get involved in humanitarian work, Zanial mentioned “looking at the news and trying to stay up to date in terms of what’s going on in these conflict settings,” before “maybe going into research.”
School of Public Health student Marisa Bellantonio said she saw the first step to getting involved as “getting outside of your immediate bubble” and “getting perspective” so “you have some context from which to base everything off of.”
In his keynote speech, Daccord pointed out several global trends in humanitarian protection, including the rise of using detention as a deterrent to migration and how access to WiFi is becoming a humanitarian need rather than a luxury.
He also explained the emergence of what he calls the “Paradox of Accountability,” where people demand more accountability but there is an increasing element of distance in humanitarian aid, in which responsibility is transferred from international organizations to local groups.
Daccord said this trend was worrisome, because in order to provide effective protection, “we have to be close to where it happened.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unnamed male student filed a civil suit against Harvard earlier this month alleging the University discriminated against him on the basis of race and gender in its handling of a Title IX complaint that accused him of sexual misconduct.
The 42-page lawsuit, filed Oct. 15 in the United States District Court of Massachusetts, details sexual activity between the plaintiff and an unnamed female undergraduate that allegedly took place in April 2017. One month later, Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution — the University office that investigates formal Title IX complaints — informed the plaintiff he was the subject of a Title IX investigation related to the April encounter, according to the suit.
The suit alleges Harvard mishandled the inquiry that followed and discriminated against the plaintiff because he is an “African-American male.” It names the University, the Board of Overseers, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, and Office for Dispute Resolution investigator Brigid Harrington as defendants.
The suit alleges that Harvard discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of gender because it consistently gave greater weight to his accuser’s account of events throughout its investigation. It further alleges the University discriminated against the plaintiff on the basis of race because Harrington did not discount the testimony offered by witnesses who also made racially charged comments.
Harvard spokespeople did not respond on the record to requests for comment.
According to the lawsuit, the plaintiff — dubbed “John Doe” throughout the document — and “Jane Roe,” the Harvard student who later filed the Title IX complaint, both attended an after-party celebrating their acapella group’s annual concert on April 1, 2017.
At the party, the two began engaging in “mutually flirtatious” behavior, the suit states.
After the party ended, Roe, Doe, and another student carried equipment back to Roe’s room. Both Roe and Doe had been drinking, though the lawsuit notes that Roe walked back to her dorm “without trouble and without assistance.” While in her room, Roe and Doe engaged in “voluntary, consensual sexual acts,” according to the suit. Doe then stayed the night.
The next morning, Roe asked Doe why he was in her bed and whether anything had “happened between them” the night before, the suit states. Doe responded that “nothing” had occurred. Roe later asked Doe again if they had had sex the night before. Doe repeated his response.
“The tone of this conversation implied that he and Roe were tacitly agreeing to never discuss it again,” the suit states.
The following day, Doe and Roe met to “clear the air.” At this meeting, Doe said he had in fact penetrated Roe with his finger and performed oral sex on her after the party. Doe maintained at the time that “both parties were willing and active participants.”
On April 27, Roe filed a complaint with the Office for Dispute Resolution alleging Doe had sexually assaulted her while she was intoxicated. On May 5, Doe received a letter from Harrington notifying him he was the subject of an ongoing ODR investigation.
Per FAS policies, once ODR opens a formal investigation into allegations of misconduct, an assigned investigator will contact the alleged perpetrator and provide them with a full list of charges. Doe’s suit alleges Harrington — who was the University-appointed investigator for the case — did not immediately provide him with a “signed and dated” copy of the complaint.
The suit also alleges the University “failed to perform a thorough and impartial investigation” into the allegations listed in the Title IX complaint. As evidence, the suit notes that Harrington conducted “only one interview” with Doe.
Doe’s attorneys also allege ODR Director William D. McCants twice declined what they say were Doe and Roe’s joint requests for informal resolution. Had Harvard chosen to resolve the complaint informally, it would have ceased investigating Doe and Roe and allowed them to settle the matter between themselves.
On Nov. 7, 2017, the College’s Administrative Board — tasked with implementing the conclusions of ODR reports on undergraduates — “determined that Plaintiff must withdraw from Harvard for a total of four (4) semesters.”
The lawsuit is not the first of its kind. Students at Amherst College, the University of Pennsylvania, and Swarthmore College have all alleged in complaints against their respective universities that administrators discriminated against them on the basis of race in Title IX investigations. None of these suits went to trial.
Doe is also not the first Harvard affiliate to level race-based criticisms against the University and its Title IX policies.
Shortly after Harvard updated its procedures for handling allegations of sexual and gender-based misconduct in July 2014, 28 Law School professors urged Harvard to reconsider the revamp. In an open letter published in the Boston Globe, the professors argued the new system does not give the accused due process. The ensuing debate eventually spurred the Law School to adopt new procedures.
Several of the 2014 letter’s signatories have since argued that Title IX procedures in general — including Harvard’s — are biased against people of color and men.
Law School Professor Jeannie Suk Gersen, who signed the letter, wrote in a 2015 New Yorker article that, “if we have learned from the public reckoning with the racial impact of over-criminalization, mass incarceration, and law enforcement bias, we should heed our legacy of bias against black men in rape accusations.”
Harvard is currently facing three federal probes into its compliance with Title IX. The government opened the first in 2014, the second in 2016, and the third in 2017.
The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights opened a similar investigation into Yale earlier this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven years ago, Harvard hosted Dartmouth for a late October matchup at Harvard Stadium. At the time, the Crimson was 3-0 in Ivy League play, having just out-battled Princeton in a 56-39 slugfest. The Big Green, on the other hand, entered Cambridge with two losses to its name, fighting for any chance to keep its title hopes alive.
As the game began, steady rain morphed into snow. The surprising wintry conditions did not freeze the Harvard offense, however, as it piled up 395 rushing yards and did not commit a turnover en route to a 41-10 win. Future NFLers Kyle Juszczyk and Cam Brate were limited to a combined 57 yards receiving.
“It wasn’t in the forecast a week prior,” Murphy said. “There’s nobody in Harvard Stadium, it’s blizzard conditions, and we just executed really well. It was just one of those days.”
This Saturday, Harvard football travels two and a half hours north to Hanover, N.H., to face Dartmouth. This time, the Big Green is undefeated in the Ancient Eight — and overall — and the Crimson is the team trying to claw its way back into contention. Again, there is rain in the forecast. With temperatures in the high 30s, this contest may fall just short of replicating the seven-year-old snow game, but anything could happen in typically snowy New Hampshire.
One major difference between these similar-seeming contests might be the final score, as it would be surprising if Dartmouth managed to flip that 41-10 result from 2011 on Harvard’s head. The Crimson is undoubtedly better than the 2011 Big Green, but this year’s Dartmouth squad — ranked 20th in the coaches poll and receiving 394 votes in the STATS poll — is possibly the most complete team Harvard will contend with in 2018.
“I think Dartmouth’s the better team [between Princeton and Dartmouth],” Murphy said. “To me, when you have the dominant defensive team in the league, that has consistently been the ticket to winning an Ivy League championship, whether it’s Harvard or anybody else. They have three three-hundred pound, twitched-up defensive linemen. I can’t remember ever seeing that in the Ivy League.”
The Big Green’s defense outshines its offense, but each are complete units. It is first in the nation in overall defense and second in scoring defense. Key to the team’s ability to shut down opposing scoring chances are three behemoths on the line and a secondary led by the nation’s leader in interceptions.
The defensive line has been instrumental in curtailing opponents’ rushing attacks (72.8 yards per game). Fifth-year senior Rocco Di Leo has six sacks and three quarterback hurries.
“Rocco is a really special defensive end,” Murphy said. “The bottom line is they have two other kids like that on the defensive front, so very challenging to figure out where you’re going to try to give extra help, where you’re going to try to double-team.... And when you watch their film it’s just different.”
The work of the linemen up front has freed up Dartmouth’s secondary to generate a number of key turnovers. Led by junior cornerback Isaih Swann (seven interceptions), the team has 12 total picks.
“You’ve got to be conscious of wherever [Swann] is on the field,” Crimson quarterback Tom Stewart said. “Don’t let him take any easy stuff underneath, just make sure we’re doing a good job looking him off, just taking what he gives us on each play.”
The Big Green’s offense is the polar opposite of its defense — where the defense grinds down opponents’ running attacks, Dartmouth’s ground game chews up yards seemingly at will (251.7 per game). The Big Green does not possess any one standout running threat, but so far Rashaad Cooper and Jared Gerbino have taken the reins. Cooper is a traditional running back, while Gerbino is a wildcat quarterback who has only thrown seven passes this season. Predicting Dartmouth’s sequencing and the plays on which it will opt to pass will be key for the Crimson to limit big gains.
Though the Big Green does not go to the air often, it does pass efficiently. The team is number one in the nation in quarterback rating and completion percentage. When Gerbino is not in the game, Derek Kyler takes snaps as more of a traditional signal caller. The sophomore has 10 passing touchdowns and has completed 76.4 percent of his attempts.
Harvard is a similarly constructed team in that its rushing attack and rushing defense have defined most of its games to this point. Sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin, who averages 129.7 yards per game, leads a backfield that is out-gaining its opponents’ running backs by over 118 yards per contest. It will be interesting to see whether the Crimson attempts to beat Dartmouth at its own game or switch up its strategy to combat the Big Green.
This game is Harvard’s third against a ranked opponent this fall — also No. 20/22 Rhode Island and No. 18/23 Princeton — the first time in the school’s history that it will have faced three ranked opponents in one season. The last three meetings between the Crimson and Dartmouth have all resulted in wins for Harvard, but only by a combined six points. The Crimson has also prevailed in 14 consecutive meetings with its neighbor to the north.
“It shows that what happened before us matters and what happens after us matters,” said senior safety and captain Zach Miller. “This game is bigger than ourselves and we have to play up to that ability. All the Ivy League games are basically rivalry games, so there’s a bit of added intensity going on, and we’re definitely going to bring it when we get up there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third consecutive time, the stage is set.
Harvard (5-1 NIRA) is set to face off against powerhouse Dartmouth (6-0) on Saturday in Hanover, N.H., for the Ivy League championship.
Last year's Ivy League championship saw a low scoring contest between the two schools, as the Big Green came out on top to win the Ancient Eight crown, scoring 22 points to top Harvard’s eight.
This year, the Crimson is looking to extend its three-game win streak after a commanding October. Harvard dominated its previous three games, defeating Quinnipiac (2-4), Notre Dame College (Ohio) (1-3), and Brown (2-3), with each game’s margin of victory being greater than the match prior. Its most recent game, a matchup against the Bears on senior day, ended in a 76-7 victory. Seniors Caitlin Weigl and Jenny Kronish capped off their final regular season tied for the most tries on the team with six. Junior Delia Hellander found the try zone three times, marking the Crimson’s first hat trick of the season. The dominant victory concluded a regular season in which Harvard was undefeated at home.
However, Saturday’s game will be in New Hampshire, where the Crimson struggled in September, suffering its only loss of the year.
The first contest between Harvard and the Dartmouth began evenly, with neither team putting a single point on the board in the first twelve minutes of the tilt.
The floodgates opened, however, as senior Alex Stendhal added a try for Dartmouth. The Big Green would continue to add to the scoreboard, notching 31 points to end the first half. The Crimson added three points of its own prior to the halftime whistle.
The second stanza followed a similar pattern. Dartmouth piled on another 24 points and Harvard struggled to respond to the Big Green’s scoring. The Crimson added another 10 points to its total, marking a total of 13—the most points that the team had put up against Dartmouth since 2016.
The loss, however, did not leave a lasting mark on Harvard’s morale.
“We knew that we would have to shake the game off and take away the tactical things, but not dwell on the results” senior Jenny Kronish said. “These last three weeks we really focused on us and not who we were playing against.”
Harvard has confidence going into this weekend’s game, especially after outings in which the squad bested Notre Dame (Ohio) by 31 and Brown by 69.
This year’s Dartmouth team, however, is undefeated. The Big Green is letting up an average of 14 points per contest. The division leader is looking to maintain its historic hegemony over the conference. The talented squad, containing two members who are representing the U.S. on the national team, has handled most of its competition with ease. However, in its most recent game, Dartmouth escaped with a six point victory over Army West Point, the same team that Harvard defeated by 11.
The Crimson is looking for its first Ivy League championship since the 2014-2015 season, as the title is being defended for the fourth consecutive year by the Big Green. However, Harvard is coming into this game with a different mindset than its previous matchups against Dartmouth.
“This time we're going into it thinking we have nothing to lose” junior Delia Hellander said. “We’re going to go into it playing our game rather than crumbling under the pressure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As October comes to a close, Harvard men’s water polo enters the final stretch of the 2018 season with two weekend matches against St. Francis (N.Y.) and Iona. This Saturday’s doubleheader comes after a 2-1 finish during its West Coast road trip at the Julian Fraser Memorial tournament in Santa Clara, Calif.
This season for Harvard (17-7, 5-1 NEWPC) has been a historic one, with the Crimson achieving its highest ranking in program history, reaching number seven in the CWPA polls at the end of September. The squad has also held control of the number one spot in the NEWPC standings, and will look to cement its position against conference foes St. Francis (6-12, 5-1) and Iona (6-20, 0-6).
One month ago the Crimson took on Iona for the first time this season, entering the contest as the highest ranked team on the East Coast. After a close first half featuring three lead changes, Harvard outscored the Gaels, 10-3, in the second half and come away with a 16-8 victory.  Junior co-captain Austin Sechrest led the day with six goals.
Since then, the squads have trended in opposite directions. The Crimson has fallen in the national polls, sharing the 15th ranking with Santa Clara, but maintaining its first place mark in the NEWPC standings with the conference championship in its sights.
Iona has not improved its winning percentage since its last bout with the Crimson, but it will try to change that this coming weekend. Sophomore 2-meters Patrick Hudak was named last week’s NEWPC Player of the Week, and sophomore goaltender Michael Banks was also recognized as the Defensive Player of the Week. In last week’s contest against Connecticut College, the Gael’s keeper broke Iona’s single-game saves record, stopping an impressive 25 shots.
For senior 2-meters Grant Harvey, the last two home games of the season grant Harvard a chance to return to some of the success it had earlier this fall.
“We had a great September, and we’ve been struggling this October a little bit...as the season goes on you get distracted with school and midterms,” Harvey said. “This second push is all about refocusing ourselves, prioritizing our lives around school and water polo, and kind of getting down to the nitty gritty and going back to where we were in September.
Hours after the Iona game, the Crimson squared off with St. Francis, defeating the Terriers in a 15-14 thriller. Each team exchanged blows in the back and forth match, and each had to finish out with five players each. Grant Harvey was able to tally the final goal for Harvard, securing the victory.
The Crimson will look to its freshman attacker Alex Tsotadze to help carry the load on the offensive side this upcoming weekend. Harvey had high praise for the rookie from Menlo Park, Calif.
“By far our most consistent player right now is our freshman Alex Tsotadze, he’s been a super big help coming in as a freshman and being a consistent starter,” Harvey said. “He’s been a true source for a lot of our offense this year.”
Since the Harvard match, St. Francis has seen mixed-results in competition, winning four games but losing three in the same time span, and its record reflects this mixed bag. The Terriers have accumulated a 5-12 record overall, but after their last win at Iona, they sit atop the conference standings at 5-1, tied with the Crimson. Junior attacker William Lapkin will try to replicate the offensive impact he had in their defeat, where he posted four goals and five assists, as St. Francis tries to take control of the conference leaderboard.
In addition to the exciting matchups, Saturday night will be a sentimental one, as it is also Senior Night. Before their last game at Blodgett Pool, a ceremony will be held honoring seniors Harvey, Nick Bunn, Nathan Ondracek, and Anthony Ridgley for their contributions to the team.
“I’ve had a lot of great wins in this pool, I’ve had a whole lot of terrible losses, so I think going out on a win would be everything,” Harvey said. “No matter how the season ends there will be some rays of sunshine. Home is where you really want to be, and playing and winning in Blodgett, there’s no better feeling.”

Cabot: Swedish Fish
Was going to roast them, but then I Scaled it down because I felt too Gill-ty.
Mather: Snickers
...from everyone who isn’t in Mather.
Dunster: Ferrero Rocher
Looks super bougie now that it’s renovated, but full of nuts.
Leverett: Milky Way
Lev may not shine like 24-karat gold, but its towers reach up to the shining stars, and what it lacks in karats it makes up for in carrot-eating rabbits.
Adams: Chocolate Gold Coins
Looks like it should be worth a lot, but is actually very mediocre. While Adams used to be one of the most sought-after houses, it is now commonly Coined the Boston Rat Sanctuary.
Lowell: Green Tea Kit Kat
Here’s the Tea: Lowell is a classic but underappreciated house, and once its renovation is complete, it’ll be a new twist on a classic flavor.
Quincy: Candy Corn
Love it or hate it, Quincy is sweet and central.
Elliot: 100 Grand
...And they like to flaunt it.
Winthrop: Pop Rocks
Currently the most Pop-ular house that everyone thinks Rocks, but this is a fad that will pass once the next house gets renovated.
Kirkland: Bark Thins
Disclaimer: Not safe for consumption by Kirkland dogs or anyone who seeks to be (Bark) Thin.

But no matter what house you’re in, rest assured that deep within, we’re all Nerds.
