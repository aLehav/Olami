Should you feel guilty about stalking someone on Facebook?
On the one hand, why would you? Facebook gives users the option to hide their profiles entirely, and if someone elects to do the opposite—to place a few photos and a few posts beneath the public spotlight—then that someone has accepted the possibility of stranger-gazes. Here is the difference between real-life stalking and online stalking: Social media users choose what to reveal about themselves. There’s no such thing as a Peeping Tom on a nudist beach. Moreover, the fact that so many people participate in Facebook stalking indicates that society at large has made peace with the behavior.
On the other hand, why wouldn’t you? Take this scenario: You are pouring through the vacation photos of a person you don’t really know, and that person is standing right behind you, scrutinizing every mouse click. Yes, you would feel uncomfortable. It’s inarguably creepy to obsess over the digital record of someone that you’ve never talked with. The fact that an action embarrasses you should force you to reevaluate that action. In the case of Facebook stalking, reevaluation reveals shame—we are ashamed to own up to the covert operations that command our late-night laptop screens.
At some point, I suppose that I should define this term, “stalking,” that lies at the middle of the controversy. In my self-created Dictionary of Online Jargon, “stalking” someone on Facebook means “scrolling through the photos and posts of someone’s profile in order to gain information that you don’t already know about that person.” You can stalk a complete stranger. You can stalk a best friend.
Stalking seems to have a variety of purposes—digging up dirt on a roommate, determining the romantic status of someone you met last weekend, and so on. In fact, people stalk out of the single unspoken motivation to assess the desirability of others.
Judging physical attractiveness is the most obvious form of assessment. Cue the beach pictures, the ten-point scale (“That’s ridiculous, he/she is clearly a seven…”), the objectification, and the inevitable disagreement.
However, we also grade and judge people that we have no romantic feelings for. When you scroll through newsfeeds, you see pictures of friends at parties, friends on vacation, friends with other friends, friends at parties on vacation with other friends, and the bright stream of images provides the raw material from which you determine a person’s location on the coolness spectrum. “Wow,” you think. “That guy/girl goes out way more than I realized.”
These judgments shape our consciousness effectively because we don’t reach them through rigorous analysis. You don’t scrutinize a changed profile picture and find that this offering is 123 percent more attractive than the last one. Instead, you extract a vague feeling, and this feeling informs your worldview—not just of that person, but also of all the people in that person’s circle.
You also inform your own self-worth. We create a mental hierarchy in order to locate ourselves somewhere in that hierarchy. Although stalking relies on the existence of other profiles, the essence of the act is egocentrism.
Sometimes you need to examine others to establish your own identity. If you wear a toga to a formal event, there’s nothing wrong with looking around, counting the number of black ties, and sprinting to the nearest bathroom.
However, the stalking that I have described exceeds this level. Facebook stalking is hardly analytic. You slip into the action, and your major motivation relates to insecurity, not a conscious desire to improve your lifestyle through exposure to others. Returning to the original question, I do believe that you should feel guilty about Facebook stalking because the behavior caters to vanity.
I also worry about the numerical grading that stalking encourages. We laugh about ones and tens, but by participating in this joking, we perpetuate superficial definitions of personal worth. If you spend enough time in an environment that repeats a humorous understanding of people as numbers, then, at some point, that philosophy seeps into your serious thinking. You demean other people based on unimportant factors, and you demean yourself.
There’s a reason that Mark Zuckerberg didn’t call his website “Soulbook.” Facebook stalking accentuates the qualities of shallowness and self-doubt that mark Facebook at its worst. We need to avoid this sort of behavior if we want to grow into us at our best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The charges that the kangaroo court brought against Jesus were very odd.
They say he claimed to be the “King of the Jews.” And they will nail these words, “King of the Jews,” above his head in mockery as he hangs on the cross.
In none of the four gospels does Jesus ever refer to himself as “King of the Jews.” Neither do his disciples address him by this title. In all four gospels, the first time anyone calls Jesus the “King of the Jews” is here, now, as he stands before the court.
From this moment on, the phrase “King of the Jews” is on everyone's lips. Whether it be from the Jewish religious authorities, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, the soldiers who carry out the flogging, or the barbaric crowd of hecklers, “King of the Jews” is virtually the only title by which Jesus is addressed from now until his death (see Mark's gospel, or John's). Tellingly, the crowd uses the title to pressure Pilate into executing Jesus, saying, “If you release this man, you are no friend of the emperor. Everyone who claims to be a king sets himself against the emperor.” All Jesus has to say in response to the charges brought against him is, “My kingdom is not of this world.”
This is all very mysterious.
Something odd is going on in the gospels' crucifixion narratives, something ironic and subversive and literarily clever. (It's actually hugely, glaringly obvious once you see it, but it's possible to overlook even the main points of the biblical narrative if our expectations of the text are lowered by its gross distortions in pop culture.)
The crucifixion is the coronation.
The language of kingship does not come completely out of the blue. Jesus has spent a lot of time talking about the “kingdom of God” as something very near at hand. By this, he appears to mean that an event is going to happen soon, such that God will be re-installed as king over a world which has lain in rebel hands for some time. The message that God will soon reign again over the earth, just as he does in heaven, is a message of good news to the poor, freedom to the oppressed, sight to the blind. The coming of the kingdom of God means revolution.
The crucifixion is the coronation.
The soldiers mock Jesus by dressing him in a purple robe (imperial colors) and a crown of thorns. They put a reed into his hand, like a scepter, and bow before him, and kneel, crying “Hail, King of the Jews.” It is a mock coronation.
But the authors of the gospels believe that something tremendously ironic is going on. The soldiers, the crowd, the kangaroo court all spoke more truly than they knew. Jesus was truly crowned that day. “Regnavit a ligno Deus,” says the 6th century hymn “Vexilla Regis”: God hath reigned from the tree.
The scandal of the cross is that Jesus redefines the meaning of authority, kingship, and power. Throughout his life and death, Jesus taught that the true king must become the servant of all. True authority is earned and manifested only in humble, selfless love. In this new, topsy-turvy kingdom of God, Jesus said, “Whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.”
If the universe is a monarchy and God is King, then we are all anti-royalists. Most of us rather resent the idea of some gigantic external authority hanging over everyone's heads, over our lives, to whom we shall all be held accountable. But the life and ministry and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth radically reinterprets what the divine monarchy looks like. God's kingdom is full of surprises. It is scary good news that God is in charge.
One might ask whether this “spiritualized” redefinition of authority still deserves to be called “authority.” In response, I could mention a familiar array of spiritual leaders, whose character impresses us with the force of authority. I could say that the power to transform people's hearts and minds is the most significant power there is.
But that's not what the early Christians would have said. They gave one reason, and one alone, for why Jesus's power was known to be real power, and his authority, true authority:
“If Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain... [and] we are of all people most to be pitied.”
Three days after the crucifixion, Jesus's body apparently went missing. Then, of all things, his bumbling friends (and even his brother James) started telling everybody that Jesus was alive and that he had work for them to do.
That is why they thought the crucifixion was the coronation.
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, I took a spur of the moment trip to the Fogg Museum’s second floor. I was looking for something important to stare at, passing from room to room, and I was in the middle of walking right past two late Renaissance pieces thinking, “As if we don’t already have enough portraits of white men at Harvard!” when a meat cleaver peaking out from a monk’s skull caught me off guard.
I came in close to verify what I was seeing. Yup, a meat cleaver. Reading the placard, I learned that this was a portrait by Lorenzo Lotto of Friar Angelo Ferretti, who was posing as Saint Peter of Verona. This saint, known more frequently as Saint Peter Martyr, was a particularly impassioned public speaker who travelled dispelling heresies such as Catharism in his time. He was travelling home to Milan in 1252 when a Cathar assassin plunged his meat cleaver into St. Peter’s skull.
Some more fun facts about this piece: In 1923, restorations revealed the very meat cleaver of which I speak, which had been painted over by an aptly-named “squeamish collector.” The corners of the canvas had also been folded over, obscuring the faint red lettering that now can be seen in the bottom right: “Credo in unum deum”—I believe in one God—the first words of the Nicene Creed, which Saint Peter Martyr allegedly scribbled out in his blood as he lay dying.
I find the collector’s revisions to be absolutely hilarious. By removing these two features from the painting, this art aficionado completely diluted the painting’s message. The meat cleaver and red lettering serve as the first and last items in a vertical scan of the piece. Reading the image from top to bottom goes something like this:
“Huh, is that a meat cleaver in his head? Oh wow, there’s a dagger in his chest…very violent…I guess that was a meat cleaver. But why are there so many weapons lodged in his—Oh, is that like a hymnal in his hand? And the other hand is pointing at something near the bottom…'Credo in unum deum.' Well, I guess that’s why he took a giant knife to the head. What do I think about that?”
By painting over the butcher’s tool and folding away the words, someone somewhere robbed this painting of its thesis. I’m delighted when I picture corseted women and wigged men oohing and aahing at this “great work of art” with our hidden meat cleaver smiling mockingly from behind its brown curtain. And I wonder to myself if in 500 years people will laugh at our gated communities and carefully doctored Instagrams in the same way I laugh at the squeamish collector now.
Certainly, in addition to being funny, this is sad. To disrespect a dying man’s last words, to rob him of the story of his death, is to profane his memory and all that to which he committed his life.
Of course, we all can sympathize with why the collector did it. Death is uncomfortable. Pain is unattractive. Much of where we fall short when trying to love marginalized people well can be traced back to these truths.
Why don’t I make eye contact with a homeless man who has no hands? Among other things, it’s because the reality of his suffering frightens me. I’ve heard people say, “I don’t go to funerals because they make me uncomfortable.” Of course they make you uncomfortable. Someone died. We all have to do a lot of processing before we get to a point where death isn’t the most terrifying thing we could ever conceive of, and I think that’s absolutely how it should be. Because in a world of disease, oppression, filth, and hate, there damn well should be a lot of things that make you uncomfortable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you ever feel like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind, then Cambridge is not the place for you.
Last week, Cambridge became the largest city on the East Coast to outlaw single-use plastic bags when the Cambridge City Council passed the ban by an eight to one vote; the measure also imposed a fee on the use of paper bags. In doing so, Cambridge joined a list of over 100 American cities that have banned plastic bags in checkout aisles. The City Council justified the legislation as a “public purpose” that achieved several environmental goals, including the preservation of aquatic areas and the reduction of carbon emissions. In particular, Cambridge officials highlighted the permanent nature of plastic pollution as a motivation for the ordinance.
As dangerous as such pollution appears, the problem of plastic bags clearly fits into a larger challenge—namely, the problem of sustainability. In the past, we have emphasized the generation-defining power of climate change, and we continue to maintain this position. Every increase—even from sources as seemingly unimportant as paper bags—in environmental efficiency matters; we applaud the city council for at least considering measures that combat climate change.
Moreover, limiting plastic-bag use represents a relatively painless way to attack the problem of carbon emissions, especially compared to some of the other alternatives. Few people derive extra satisfaction from shoveling groceries into a single-use plastic bag instead of a multi-use canvas bag. As such, by reducing social reliance on plastic (and paper) bags, the City Council was able to tackle at least one component of the larger environmental issue without forcing individuals to completely transform their day-to-day lifestyles.
At the same time, while we believe that the intent of the City Council’s decision is laudable, we do not see a ban as the ideal way of fulfilling this goal. There is a significant difference between a law that controls plastic bags and a law that outlaws plastic bags. In this latter case, an outright ban needlessly provokes debate about personal choice; the divisiveness of a ban—whether or not that controversy is warranted—is unproductive. By making plastic bags illegal in checkout lines, the city council achieves a desirable objective through an undesirable method.
In place of a stringent ban, a tax on plastic bags promises to reduce use without stirring up as many grumpy consequences. Not only will Cambridge lower reliance on single-use bags, but the city will also drum up some money in the process. Although a small fee may not seem likely to alter consumer behavior, case studies indicate otherwise. Both the extra price and a newfound awareness of the environmental impact of plastic bags influence decisions.
By adopting a strategy of taxing plastic bags, the City Council could have combined all the benefits of an outright ban with few of the drawbacks. Nevertheless, we believe that the intent of the measure was in the right spirit. In truth, the biggest downside will likely be the lack of bags to scoop up dog poop.

Harvard’s House renewal projects have so far largely replaced in-suite bathrooms with hallway bathrooms, which means that Dorm Crew—a student-run division of Facilities Maintenance Operations—will see a shift in where it cleans and what other jobs it takes on with the renovations.
Much of Dorm Crew's work consists of cleaning private student bathrooms. Laura K. Brennan ’16, co-head captain of Dorm Crew, estimates that Dorm Crew workers currently clean between 1,000 and 1,100 in-suite bathrooms in both the Yard dorms and the Houses.
Renewal projects so far have changed House bathroom configurations. Brennan said Dorm Crew is unlikely to take on the responsibility of cleaning hallway bathrooms even if their number on campus increases.
“Hall baths are less ‘Dorm Crew friendly,’” Brennan said, explaining that hallway bathrooms must be cleaned every day without exception—a requirement that would conflict with Dorm Crew’s goal to provide student jobs with flexible hours.
“It would be difficult [for us] to reach that hall bathroom standard,” she said.
Still, Brennan said the student-run division of FMO is unlikely to need to decrease its staff because of House renewal even if future projects continue to reduce the number of in-suite bathrooms.
Referencing Dorm Crew’s long history on campus and describing it as “adaptable,” Brennan said Dorm Crew has responsibilities beyond cleaning in-suite bathrooms, such as cleaning Yard buildings or helping with snow removal. In recent years, it has also begun to conduct weekly safety inspections in the Houses.
“There’s always work to be done,” Brennan said.
Jason W. Luke ’94, associate director of custodial and support services at FMO, said FMO has shifted some private bathroom cleaning responsibilities back to Dorm Drew as the number of hallway bathrooms in other Houses has increased with the renovations.
“There is a fair number of private bathrooms being done by FMO staff,” Luke said, adding that Dorm Crew has been unable to clean all the private restrooms for a long time due to its limited student workforce. According to Luke, Dorm Crew is currently working at capacity.
“We’ve shifted things back to Dorm Crew in certain situations.… The overall volume [of Dorm Crew’s work] is the same, really,” he said.
Brennan also said the previous House renewal projects—Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall and Quincy House’s Stone Hall—and the current work on Dunster House have had minimal effect on Dorm Crew’s work. A private contractor has long cleaned Quincy, and Leverett gave Dorm Crew a new contract to clean the Towers, replacing its contract for McKinlock Hall, she added.
Brennan said she did not know if either Dorm Crew or FMO staff would clean Dunster next year, as Dunster, before renovations, had employed a private contractor to clean its bathrooms. Dorm Crew is currently in charge of cleaning Dunster’s swing housing at the Inn and at Prescott Street.
Due to the cleaning standards for hallway bathrooms, Luke said he does expect House renewal to increase FMO’s work volume.
“Eventually, you’d have to expand, or more likely, increase people’s hours,” he said.
Luke noted, however, that any impact was unlikely to be felt in the near future.
“House renewal is a long, long process,” he said.

The participation and completion rates of online courses offered by the Harvard and MIT branches of online learning platform edX varied across academic areas, according to a recent report based on two years of course data.
The study reviewed data on HarvardX and MITx, subsets of a virtual learning platform founded jointly by the two universities in 2012. Covering data spanning from fall 2012 to summer 2014, the report analysis included 68 courses, 1.7 million participants, and 1.1 billion logged events, or “clicks.”
According to the study, growth in course participation has been steady, with around 1,300 new participants joining a HarvardX or MITx course per day. The report defined “participants” as registrants who accessed any chapter of course content, according to Andrew D. Ho, chair of the HarvardX research committee and a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“There is an increasing number of registrants who never visit the course,” Ho said. By not including all registrants over the two-year period, the study excluded 1.3 million users, he added.
Despite the high number of participants, the level of enrollment engagement varied across academic disciplines. According to the report, computer science courses had almost twice as many participants—around 68,000 per course on average—as humanities, social studies, design, and government courses combined. However, the completion rates in STEM courses, including computer science, were only around half the rates in the humanities and social studies.
The report also found that only about  one in five participants in the average STEM/CS course were female, while humanities and social studies courses had around twice that percentage of females.
There was also a disparity in completion rates, an area that has previously been studied by HarvardX research fellows. On average, the report found that only 5 percent of participants who did not pay a fee for ID verification actually completed their online course. However, for those who did pay to verify their identity—a fee that has ranged from $25 to $250 across courses—around 59 percent gained certification.
Ho said these findings show that the success of online courses should not be measured by completion rates.
“If we want to raise completion rates, we could charge everybody money,” he said. “The low certification rates are a function of openness and accessibility, and I think a myopic focus on completion rates is contrary to the mission of open access to educational resources.”
Isaac L. Chuang, professor of physics and senior associate director of digital learning at MIT, offered a similar perspective, adding that a better measure of the effectiveness of online courses would be how they can change the way classes are taught on campus.
“Let’s ask ourselves in year three—how much of this effort on MOOCs is turning around and being used to...experiment with education on campus,” he said. “The more it succeeds in that dialogue and improves learning on campus, the more I think we would be willing...to say that this was a successful experiment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will no longer conduct pre-term course planning if members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences vote in favor of proposed changes to the student handbook at their monthly meeting on Tuesday.
Pre-term planning for the coming fall semester is already temporarily suspended as necessitated by the rollout of a new Student Information System in the fall because there will be no means to run the tool, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. Making this change permanent will require a Faculty vote, he wrote in an email.
Faculty, students, and administrators have long debated the purpose of pre-term planning, which requires undergraduates to indicate in which classes they intend to enroll in the following semester, though their choices are not binding.
Many students and faculty say the tool—implemented in 2010 as a means of offering College administrators guidance in hiring teaching fellows and assigning classrooms—often gives imprecise data about course enrollments.
Since its inception, pre-term planning has been a frequent topic of discussion among members of the Committee on Undergraduate Education, who have similarly criticized the tool for not giving faculty members an accurate sense of their courses’ enrollments. Many faculty have said that they have needed to hold unanticipated lotteries to determine who would enroll in their courses.
In September, Women, Gender, and Sexuality lecturer Caroline Light said she estimated 150 students shopped her seminar class, which was only designed for 12 students.
Harris wrote in an email that he sees no reason to keep pre-term planning in place, and that the new Student Information System to be rolled out in the fall would not be able to accommodate the tool.
“We are doing away with it now,” Harris wrote. “The new SIS is not ready for it, and as it provides little useful additional information to historical and Q data...there seems to be no reason to keep it.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will present the proposed removal of pre-term planning, along with other changes to the student handbook’s language, at the FAS faculty meeting Tuesday, including the elimination of a final examination policy that stipulates that students may not leave the examination room for the first 30 minutes of a test.
The Faculty will also vote on proposed legislation for an affirmation of integrity to the College’s first-ever honor code and on plans for the structure of a new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media.

In a move that could alter the working dynamic between Harvard and many of its teaching fellows and Ph.D. seekers, a group of graduate students has begun an effort to unionize, according to members of the movement.
Aaron T. Bekemeyer and Elaine F. Stranahan, graduate students involved in the unionization effort, said Friday that the movement is still in its early stages, but added that it counts members from all three divisions of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Bekemeyer and Stranahan did not share the number of participants with The Crimson.
The Harvard graduate students join peers at Yale in organizing to unionize. If the movement is successful, it could change the way graduate students interact with the University, according to members who envisioned a more centralized complaint system and suggested that a union could empower graduate students in negotiations with Harvard.
“We are interested in making the University a better place for grad students to do the best research and teaching that they can do,” Bekemeyer said.
Stranahan said she hopes Harvard and its graduate students can see eye-to-eye.
“We are hopeful that the University will be fully cooperative with us, that they share the exact same interests that we are advocating for, that what is their best interest is in our interest, that we are on the same side, really,” she said.
Legal precedent, however, has gone against similar efforts at other schools. While last year the National Labor Relations Board ruled that football players at Northwestern held the legal status of employees at the university and could form a union, a 2004 ruling classified graduate students at Brown as non-employees, meaning that federal union protections would not apply to them. This ruling, according to Rutgers professor Paula B. Voos, means that private schools still hold the upper hand with graduate union efforts.
“[Graduate students] cannot make the employers [recognize a union] even if they have an election that wins the majority vote saying that they wish to unionize,” Voos said.
Citing that precedent, Columbia has not recognized a union that graduate students voted to form in 2014. Those students have since brought their case to the NLRB, which has not yet announced a decision.
When New York University teaching and research assistants unionized in 2013, they were the only union of graduate assistants recognized by a private university in the U.S., according to The New York Times. Many administrations at other private universities where there have been unionization movements have opposed it.
Members of the Harvard movement are watching other unionization movements closely, according to Stranahan.
“We are aware of and following some of the unionization campaigns among graduate students and other schools,” she said. “We have yet to see what that larger national scene and the legal circumstances that result and how that will affect what our path will end up being.”
Ann Hall, a GSAS spokesperson, declined to comment on the school’s views of the labor movement. Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, similarly declined.
Stranahan said the unionization movement is focusing on a number of issues, including health care including dental care, housing and family concerns, and the experience of teaching fellows.
Bekemeyer drew a distinction between the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement focused on capping section sizes in undergraduate courses, and the unionization group, but said the entities might work toward complementary goals.
“The Teaching Campaign is about a pedagogical issue about providing a better opportunity for undergraduates in these classes. But I also think it is a platform to raise these other issues about what teaching is like for TFs, and it won’t solve all of them directly, but it will hopefully provide momentum to address these other issues,” he said. “These are the exact sort of issues that [a] union would help with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over six months after hundreds of Harvard affiliates received emailed death threats, many undergraduates await an official end to the police investigation into the source of the emails.
Last October, an email containing death threats hit the inboxes of more than 100 Harvard affiliates, disproportionately targeting women of Asian descent. Days later, the Harvard University Police Department confirmed that the emails originated overseas and did not pose a threat. About two months later, the department handed off an investigation to authorities in Germany, where the sender of the email had claimed to reside. One of the addresses associated with the threats had been emailing undergraduates for several months, and another address sent a correspondence on Christmas morning appearing to apologize in broken English for the previous threats.
Last week, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that although the case was ongoing, HUPD was “done for now.” Catalano directed comment to the the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Boston office, where FBI spokesperson Kristen M. Setera declined to comment.
Leaders of campus cultural organizations and some undergraduates who received the death threats praised student groups’ response since last semester, but expressed a desire for further details about the police investigation.
“I and many of my peers who were deeply affected by this incident would deeply appreciate having final closure with the incident,” Gurbani Kaur ’18, who is currently taking time off from school, wrote in an email. Kaur expressed a desire that the individual or individuals responsible for the threats face not only punitive consequences, but also receive anti-discriminatory training and mental health counseling.
In the aftermath of the threats, many students criticized College administrators' response. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana later acknowledged that administrators could improve communication with students and sent an email to undergraduates characterizing the emailed threats as “despicable.”
Although undergraduates praised subsequent progress of students and administrators who are organizing to improve the College’s current bias reporting system, they reiterated a desire for the close of the police investigation.
“I would like some closure to the event, but thankfully it’s not anything that is a daily thing that I have to face,” said Viet D. Tran ’16, co-president of the Harvard Vietnamese Association.
In an interview last week, Khurana said the College’s communications in this case depend largely on information Harvard receives from the authorities’ investigation.
“If it’s appropriate, we’ll communicate it broadly,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reflecting upon the journey to understand their own gender, genderqueer activist Jacob Tobia spoke Saturday about the need for an inclusive BGLTQ movement that liberates people of all genders and the importance of non-binary language to describe gender.
Tobia is a speaker, writer, and advocate who works to promote equality for “gender non-conforming, genderqueer, and transgender people,” according to Tobia's website. Tobia has recently been interviewed by Laverne Cox on MTV and featured by The Washington Post, The New York Times, and HuffPost Live.
Tobia, who identifies as genderqueer and uses the pronouns they, their, and them, spoke about the importance of recognizing gender as a spectrum, not a binary, in order to meet the needs of gender nonconforming people.
“My dream for the world is that gender just plays,” Tobia said at a Queer Students and Allies event in Harvard Hall. “That gender becomes fun.”
Language has the power to determine who is able to be visible and who is not, so moving beyond the gender binary is key to creating a safe space for everyone, Tobia said. Tobia added that the gender binary of man and woman created unnecessary gender roles and differentiation.
Tobia said “queer,” “genderfluid,” “non-binary,” and “genderless” are terms that could better encompass the diverse identities of people who feel they do not fit into the gender-binary categories of man or woman.
“People want to brush these terms off as unscientific,” Tobia said, “but recognizing the needs of non-binary people is important to building an inclusive environment for all genders.”
Tobia spoke of personal struggles in defining their gender identity, sharing personal anecdotes of the first time Tobia bought a pair of high heels and of wearing a “Jackie Kennedy pink dress” at their graduation from Duke.
“It was a series of experiments that felt more and more right,” Tobia said. “Now I’m in a place where I own my femme. It’s mine, and I show it to the world everyday.”
Tobia also said it is important for a broader set of people to represent the non-binary movement, beyond transgender icons such as actress Laverne Cox and model Andreja Pejić.
“There needs to be a proliferation of representation,” Tobia said.
Tobia said their strategy to encourage greater inclusivity in the community is maintaining a positive and lighthearted attitude about gender identity.
In an interview after the event, QSA Political Co-Chair Jordan T. Weiers ’16 said the QSA invited Tobia to speak to allow for a plurality of voices on campus. “We wanted to have a diverse set of perspectives from a prominent genderqueer activist,” Weiers said.
Weiers said Tobia’s presentation was a fresh look at people left out of the conversation.
“It was really opening and welcoming,” Weiers said. “They encouraged us to critically re-evaluate the priorities of the queer movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking to a packed audience Friday night, His Excellency Mahamadou Issoufou, President of Niger, called for African unity and a “new world governance” based on equity and inclusivity in an address at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
The presidential keynote was the kick-off event for the sixth annual African Development Conference at Harvard, which brought policymakers, lawyers, and academics together for a weekend at the Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Law School to discuss “the role of South-South collaboration in the attainment of Africa’s development objectives," according to the conference website.
Issoufou’s remarks came roughly four years after he assumed office as Niger’s president in April 2011. He has previously served as the country’s prime minister, the president of its national assembly, and the leader of the opposition during the presidency of Mamadou Tandja, who served as president from 1999 to 2010.
Issoufou began his address by highlighting the challenges Niger and the African continent face today, highlighting the terrible and persistent impact centuries that he says slavery and European colonization have had on African culture and the continent’s economies.
“The time of slavery and colonization [was] a tremendous curse for Africa,” he said. “The worst in this situation was not the theft of our natural resources or human resources—the worst has been alienation [and] that Africans have lost confidence in themselves and their civilization.”
Tens of millions Africans sent to the New World as slaves, Issoufou said, have been unable to contribute to African development, adding to what he called the “humiliat[ion]” of Africa. For Africa to be a major player on the world stage, Issoufou said it must “find its identity again,” regain its lost confidence, and, most importantly, unite as a continent.
“Niger doesn’t have any future beyond that of an united and solidary Africa,” he said. “My objective is the rebirth of Niger and beyond that to contribute to the renaissance of the continent.”
Issoufou outlined the “Renaissance” development plan that he has launched for Niger, which aims at growth through investments in infrastructure, education, and health, and through the creation of strong, democratic government institutions. Niger was ranked last in the United Nation’s Human Development Index released in 2014.
In an interview before the event, Issoufou said he believes this sort of infrastructure-oriented development would also be key to combating terrorist organizations like Boko Haram, which attacked Nigerien border towns in February.
“We think that the solution to face terrorism is to ensure security in the short run; but in [the] long run, the real solution is social and economic development because it is [on] the ground, the ground of poverty, that terrorism is bred,” Issoufou said.
Issoufou also said that the Nigerien populace does not consider Boko Haram an Islamic or Muslim organization, noting that “Islam is, by definition, a religion of peace and toleration, and of justice.”
“The terrorists from Boko Haram, as well as other terrorists, are not Muslim,” Issoufou said. “I said it and I will say it again...They are the worst enemies of Islam.”
Issoufou also referenced recent events in Libya to illustrate what he called a clear “lack of democratic values in world governance,” saying that although Niger is a neighbor of Libya, the country was not consulted in the 2011 multinational military intervention in Libya.
“Today, we are paying the price for the intervention where the decision [was] taken without us,” Issoufou said, emphasizing that the world needed a new paradigm focused on inclusivity and equitability. “In order to get out of the chaos it is now necessary to listen to us...united Africa must be an active partner.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council discussed the lack of accessibility in campus buildings at its general meeting on Sunday night.
During the Council’s scheduled “Community Time,” time allotted for non-UC students to address the Council, Kunho Kim ’17 and Brad I. Riew ’17 spoke about some of their concerns that Harvard is overall disjointed and inaccessible to students with disabilities.
Kim and Riew initially brought up the issue at an open forum with University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on March 24, reminding the administrators that a handful of upperclassman dining halls and Houses are fully accessible.
At Sunday’s meeting, the two repeated many of their thoughts and concerns to UC representatives, many of whom had been in attendance at the forum. Kim and Riew said another major issue stems from what they see as a lack of publicity and communication from Harvard University Disability Services.
“Elevators or ramps, when they don’t work, people don’t know where to report them,” Kim said, adding that University Disability Services is often difficult to reach via email.
Kim also said the campus is overall extremely “decentralized,” with buildings overseen by different building managers, making it further difficult to notify the school of accessibility issues.
In response, some UC representatives suggested that changes in Ventfull, a smartphone application that the Council brought to Harvard earlier this semester, and the proposed UC remake of the official Harvard smartphone application could prove useful to students concerned about accessibility.
UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 proposed an added “tag” on Ventfull for events that are fully accessible. Other tags on the app currently filter for things such as social events and events with free food. He added that after the Council’s Harvard app reboot is launched, it will also contain more thorough contact information for University Disability Services and other campus resources.
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, also at the meeting, added that it is the responsibility of all undergraduates to report various lapses in accessibility.
“It can’t be the burden of one person,” Lassonde said. “All of us need to take responsibility for this—it’s a really important issue.”
The Council’s Student Relations Committee chair, William Oh ’18, also proposed that representatives compile a list of the College’s building managers, along with their contact information, to make reporting things like broken elevators or inaccessible wheelchair ramps more efficient.
Later in the meeting, the Council’s constitution was amended to penalize representatives who fail to vote on a piece of legislation with an additional absence on their attendance record. The amendment was passed with two votes cast in opposition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard softball team (14-15, 5-3 Ivy) extended its winning streak to six games at home against Ancient Eight rivals Cornell (8-15, 2-6) and Princeton (10-17, 2-4). The weekend saw strong performances from both the Crimson’s pitchers and its defense, as Harvard gave up only five runs in four games.
“I think they’re really starting to hit their stride,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “The key to it is great pitching, great hitting, and timely defense, and we got that [this weekend].”
HARVARD 6, PRINCETON 1
The tail end of Saturday’s double-header saw the Crimson’s bats come alive early and often, tallying all the team’s runs in the first four innings.
Freshman center fielder Maddy Kaplan wasted no time lighting up the scoreboard, ripping a two-run home run over the right field wall in the bottom of the first following a single from senior left fielder Andrea Del Conte
Later in the first, senior shortstop Emily Gusse added another run when she drilled a single to right field, driving in senior right fielder Katherine Lantz.
The Tigers offense was stymied by the Crimson’s pitching and defense, led by sophomore pitcher Taylor Cabe, who carried a no-hit effort into the top of the fifth inning while striking out six batters and earning her third win of the season. Del Conte sparked the Harvard defense by robbing Princeton’s Skye Jerpbak of an extra-base hit on a diving catch in left-center field.
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 1
Junior right fielder Haley Davis stepped up to the plate with one runner on second base, two outs, and the scored tied, 1-1, in the bottom of the seventh inning. Davis took the pitch on a one-and-one count and ripped a line drive to left field. Del Conte scored from second to seal the walk-off win for the Crimson.
After a throwing error and passed ball from Harvard in the top of the first inning, the Tigers capitalized on the Crimson’s defensive mistakes to take a 1-0 lead on a groundout from Princeton’s Alyssa Schmidt.Harvard responded in the third inning as Lantz earned her 17th RBI of the season in just 22 games, driving in junior center fielder Zoe Galindo.
Senior pitcher Laura Ricciardone struck out five and gave up no earned runs in the complete game effort.
“We bounced back [from previous Ivy League losses] and hit our stride here today,” Ricciardone said. “Our defense was stellar today, and we were making plays by taking away Princeton’s hits.”
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 3
Three pitchers split the effort evenly, each going two and one third innings in Friday’s second half of a home double-header versus visiting Ivy League opponent Cornell.
It was Ricciardone, though, who earned the win for the Crimson after coming on to replace Cabe in the fifth inning. Additionally, in the bottom of the sixth inning, the Slidel, La., native belted her first home run of the season in just her 10th at bat this year.
The Big Red scored first, notching two runs in the third inning off of Cornell pitcher Meg Parker’s two-run blast. Harvard responded in the same inning with three runs of its own, including two off a bases-loaded single from Lantz.
The Crimson broke a short-lived 3-3 tie in the fifth inning when Del Conte scored on a Big Red fielding error.
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 0
The Crimson showed its offensive abilities from the get-go as Lantz took Big Red pitcher Maddie Orcutt deep in the first inning for a two-run home run. Following a three-run first inning, Harvard followed with three more in the second off of RBIs from Del Conte, Gusse, and Davis.
Ricciardone picked up the victory after a complete game showing, striking out two batters and walking just one.
“We had a very focused approach, and we were relaxed at the plate,” Allard said. “We swung our bats like we know how to swing and trusted that we were going to get good pitching performances and make plays.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (5-4, 3-1 Ivy) has strung together consecutive wins, pushing the team into a tie for third in the Ivy League. Behind hat tricks from freshman midfielder Julia Glynn and sophomore midfielder Megan Hennessey, the Crimson topped Brown (5-5, 0-4) Saturday by a score of 9-7, sending the Bears to their four-straight conference loss.
Brown held the shot advantage (17-15), but Harvard never trailed,  jumping out to a 5-2 halftime lead in the process. The Crimson offense was accurate on the day, as nine of its 13 shots on goal made their way past Bears' goaltender Kellie Roddy.
After two quiet games in which she did not even take a shot, Hennessey came out firing on Saturday, scoring Harvard’s first two goals without needing to be assisted. Her third and final goal of the day came with 3:58 remaining in the first half, with the assist coming from Glynn.
The Manhasset, N.Y., native matched her career high with five points against the Bears. She has notched at least three points in each of the past six contests.
Though the game narrative may have been dominated by the two midfielders, it was the Harvard defense that came up strong to hold off a late Brown charge. After cruising to a 7-3 lead with over 20 minutes to go in the contest, the Crimson conceded the next three goals to let the Bears pull within one. But Glynn scored her third and final goal of the day with 6:49 remaining, and junior midfielder Audrey Todd iced the game for the Crimson with 40 seconds remaining on a score of her own.
Despite scoring fewer goals in each of the past two games (nine) than in recent losses against Princeton and Stanford, the Crimson has come out on top thanks to its efforts on the defensive side of the ball. In her past two contests against Dartmouth and Penn, Harvard junior goaltender Kelly Weis had 10 and four saves, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team continued its recent trek down the Eastern seaboard Saturday, making a trip to Purchase, N.Y., to compete in the Met Intercollegiate Tournament, hosted by fellow Ivy League school Yale. Competitors played 36 holes over the course of the competition. The morning round took place at Century Country Club, while the afternoon’s 18 holes were played at Old Oaks Country Club.
Behind top-five finishes from sophomores Kendrick Vinar and Robert Deng, Harvard placed third in team competition, with a combined score of 635 over the two rounds. The Crimson came into the clubhouse behind only Army and champion Temple.
“Temperatures were in the low 40s, there were 20…mile per hour winds throughout the day, and rain was falling,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “At our best, our shot count would be much lower, but I’m not concerned given the conditions.”
On the individual side, Vinar rode a plus-nine scoreline to a runner-up finish, three strokes behind Brandon Matthews of Temple. Vinar shot a 74 in the first round, followed by a 76 in the second. The score of 74 tied him with Matthews for the top score at Century.
Also placing in the top-five for the Crimson was sophomore Robert Deng. The Irvine, Calif., native ended tied for fourth place with a combined score of 13 shots over par.
In addition to Vinar, the Crimson squad was comprised of junior Rohan Ramnath, freshman Gregory Royston, captain Akash Mirchandani, and sophomore Daniel De La Garza. Deng competed at the invitational as an individual player.
Ramnath ended his day plus-19, tied for 21st overall, while Royston’s plus-20 result was good for 25th.
Both courses were tough for all teams, as only one competitor was able to match par in a single round, and no player was able to finish under par.
“The course was quite up and down, so it was a long walk throughout the day,” Royston said. “That combined with the wind was mentally taxing and had some of us drained by the end of the day.”
Harvard did not have the luxury of being able to play outdoors from October to March due to the frigid temperatures in the Boston area. The team took a trip to California during spring break in order to get some practice in before commencing their spring campaign.
“It seems like every course within a four and a half hour radius of us is still closed,” Rhoads said. “Playing outside during spring break helped us, but it’s been difficult for us to be able to play outdoors on a consistent basis.”
Of the nine schools participating in the invitational, only four schools hailed from outside the Ivy League: Temple, Army, Bucknell, and Fordham.
“It’s always nice to get in some play against strong teams from other regions,” Royston said. “Seeing other teams who have been able to play outdoors throughout the year gives us a good barometer of where we’re at.”
Harvard finished first among Ancient Eight competitors, besting Yale, Cornell, Penn, and Brown, who finished fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth, respectively. In three weeks, the Crimson will be facing these teams, as well as the rest of the Ivy League, at the Ivy Championships to determine who earns a trip to the NCAA regionals.
“We need to improve on everything, but overall it’s the more nuanced aspects of the game,” Rhoads said. “Things like taking the wind into account, putting directionally, and remaining mentally sound are what’s going to make the biggest difference moving forward.”
This is the Crimson’s second tournament since the conclusion of the fall season in October. Harvard was able to improve on its fifth-place finish last weekend in the Seahawk Intercollegiate Tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a blustery day in Hamden, Conn., gusts of offense from the Quinnipiac women’s rugby team proved decisive, as the Bobcats claimed a trio of rugby sevens matches over Harvard. The event, which honored Austin Hill, a teenager with cystic fibrosis, represented the Crimson’s final chance at fine-tuning before the Ivy League Sevens Championships two weeks from now.
“We’re shaking off the cobwebs,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “We’re still trying to learn the game of sevens…[and] work out the kinks in our plan.”
QUINNIPIAC A-SIDE 27, HARVARD A-SIDE 21
The scorecard may have read Harvard versus Quinnipiac, but for the majority of the first game of the day, play reflected a different sort of competition. Call it Cheta Emba versus the world.
In the first half, Emba, a senior for Harvard, put the visitors up 14-9 with a pair of tries and conversions that came within three minutes of each other. Then, with the score close midway through the second period, Emba contributed another score to push the Crimson ahead yet again.
“When she decides the team is going to score a try, she makes it happen,” Kantor said. “She is an extreme competitor…It’s that intensity that makes her so successful on the rugby field and is also something that I hope can be inspiring to other players.”
However, the single-woman effort fell short, as the Bobcats converted two late tries to saddle Emba and company with a 27-21 defeat.
Quinnipiac struck first in both halves. In the first period, a score in the first minute gave the Bobcats a 5-0 advantage; in the second period, the hosts ran the ball back off the opening kickoff to erase a 14-9 halftime deficit.
Yet the score remained close until the final minutes, when Quinnipiac erased a late Harvard lead with two final tries.
“Quinnipiac is a longstanding varsity team,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “We showed we could outmatch them for stretches at times.”
QUINNIPIAC A-SIDE 46, HARVARD A-SIDE 5
In the opening minutes of play, the second A-side match of the game seemed destined to be a copy of the first.
Just like in the earlier contest, the Bobcats had built an early advantage—this time 12-0; just like last time, Emba had responded with a score that had sliced into the deficit.
But in this game, Quinnipiac had no appetite for late drama. The Bobcats ran through the second half with five straight tries and earned a 46-5 victory.
Quinnipiac senior Shannon Durkin set the tone at the beginning of the second period by taking the kickoff back 50 yards for a try. Durkin had also scored at the end of the first half to distance the Bobcats from the Crimson.
However impressive this midgame streak appeared, the most impressive Quinnipiac score of the day was likely the first one, when all-American Natalie Kosko shrugged off a pair of tackles and landed a tough stiff arm en route to a 20-yard gallop.
“Quinnipiac’s a great team,” Kantor said. “They played very well.”
QUINNIPIAC B-SIDE 39, HARVARD B-SIDE 0
In the team’s sole event of the afternoon, the Bobcats B-side scored early and often, cruising to a 39-0 victory over Harvard.
On Quinnipiac’s team, freshman Lillian Weldon starred. In the second half, she tallied three consecutive scores to turn the shutout into a blowout. Senior Raechel Stimson also contributed a pair of tries for the Bobcats.
Despite the lopsided score, the match provided the Crimson with an opportunity to familiarize newer players with the sevens rugby format. Even more veteran Harvard players lacked much sevens experience, as the team plays full-sided games in the fall.
Moreover, several first-time players have joined the Crimson team, some as recently as after spring break.
“We have a lot of new players out there,” Kantor said. “Despite what the scoreboard says, their demonstration of what they’ve been able to absorb…bodes really well for our future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a Cornell goal with 40 seconds left threatened to send the game into overtime, junior attackman Devin Dwyer picked off a pass intended for Big Red defenseman Jordan Stevens just moments later and scored to regain the lead for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team. The Crimson (5-5, 1-2 Ivy) then shut down a final effort by No. 8/6 Cornell (7-3, 3-1) to seal a 10-9 victory against its Ivy League rivals on Saturday at Soldiers Field Stadium.
“Our defensive group sold out for each other all game and didn't budge in the last few seconds, forcing [Cornell senior midfielder] Buczek into a shot that I could handle,” junior goalkeeper Bryan Moore said. “I was proud of the way all 16 guys that found themselves on the defensive end of the field at some point handled themselves. Those guys delivered a fantastic performance and I'm immensely proud of them.
Coming off a ten-day layoff, Harvard opened the contest brimming with energy. After sophomore face-off specialist Domenic Massimilian put the Big Red on the board just five seconds into the game, the Crimson controlled the rest of the quarter, forcing eight turnovers while limiting the Cornell offense to just six shots.
“We made some slight schematic adjustments,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “The break definitely helped us regroup, reset, and then be fresh for [the game].”
Freshman midfielder Morgan Cheek struck first for Harvard, netting the second goal of his career to tie the game. Junior midfielder Sean McDonagh and Dwyer would both add tallies, giving the Crimson a 3-1 lead after the opening frame.
Cornell started the second quarter with back-to-back goals to level the score, but Harvard responded with a goal by freshman midfielder Robert Mencke to push the score to 4-3. Sophomore long stick midfielder Matt Ryan set up the shot with a nice play in transition, as he dumped the ball off to Mencke while falling down. The Dallas native caught the ball in stride and fired it stick-side high for the first goal of his career.
After the Big Red answered again to make it 4-4, junior long stick midfielder Jack Breit weaved through the Cornell defense before slotting home his third goal of the season. Junior midfielder Ian Ardrey then tallied with just over a minute left to give the Crimson a two-goal lead heading into halftime.
Coming out of the break, Harvard scored another transition goal, as Ryan ripped a bounce shot to the upper corner off a pass from junior midfielder Brendan Newman. The marker pushed the score to 7-4, giving the Crimson its largest lead of the game.
“Cornell…outplayed us significantly [at the face-off X], so we weren’t going to get as many settled offensive opportunities,” Wojcik said. “We really wanted to push the ball in transition and create scoring opportunities there, and I thought our long sticks did a great job with that.”
However, the Big Red would battle back with a 4-1 run, tying the game at eight with eight minutes left to play. Cornell was able to wear down the Harvard defense with a number of sustained possessions late in the third quarter, and the Big Red offense capitalized early on in the fourth.
On a day when Harvard received offensive contributions from a number of unlikely sources, the squad ultimately turned to its leading scorers down the stretch. With just three minutes left, freshman midfielder Joe Lang got underneath his defender on a dodge from the wing and scored to give the Crimson the lead.
When Cornell senior attackman Dan Litner finished a crease feed from classmate Matt Donovan to tie the game at nine and Massimilian corralled the ensuing face-off, the Big Red appeared in control. However, Dwyer stepped in front of Massamilian’s pass and made a leaping one-handed catch before netting the game winning goal as Cornell sophomore netminder Christian Knight scrambled to get back in cage.
Coming into the game with four straight losses and nursing an 0-2 record in Ivy League play, Harvard was able to reverse the trend against a potent opponent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams opened the spring season this weekend, taking on Cornell, George Washington, Penn, Brown, and Georgetown. The men’s teams registered a win and a split, while the women’s heavyweight and lightweight teams lost and won, respectively.
Men’s Heavyweight Wins, Lightweight Splits
The No. 3 Harvard men’s heavyweight team hit the water bright and early for their home race against Cornell and George Washington.
“It felt great to get back in the swing of the racing season, especially with such a long winter,” senior lightweight Alexander Bonorris said. “We pretty much just began rowing again, so it is a bit of a shock being up at race pace, but we are picking it up quickly.”
The team continued its hot streak, winning three of the five races.
In the V8 race, Harvard finished first with a time of 6:02.50, almost four seconds ahead of Cornell, which came in at 6:06.30. The JV team had a closer win, edging out the Big Red by just over two seconds.
The freshman boat started out its season strong, dropping both GW and Cornell in open water. The freshmen finished in 6:21.30, and the nearest competitor, Cornell, finished over 14 seconds later, and GW rounding out the lot over 30 seconds behind the Crimson.
It was a windy day for racing for men’s lightweight team, which split against No. 8 Penn and No.1 Cornell this weekend. The team defeated No. 8 Penn and lost to No. 1 Cornell on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia.
The freshmen boats had the only wins of the day. The freshmen eight team won by a boat length, finishing at 6:01.40. Cornell came in just under six seconds later, and Penn finished eight seconds after Cornell.
The A and B teams won the freshmen 4+ race by open water, with the A team finishing in 7:06.1, and the B team coming in with a time of 7:24.4.
The first varsity team finished its race in the middle of the pack at 6:05.9, just over six seconds behind the Big Red and just under three seconds ahead of the Quakers. The JV team came in third place in its race, while the 3V team lost by open water, finishing 13.5 seconds behind Cornell.
Radcliffe Heavyweight Lose, Lightweight Win
The Radcliffe heavyweight team had a slower start to its season, falling to No. 3 Brown. Both teams had to deal with the rain and flat water with an incoming current on the Seekonk River in Providence, but the Bears bested the Crimson in all five races.
The varsity four race was the closest of the day, with the A boat finishing at 7:57.60, five seconds behind Brown. The V8 team also had a close race, finishing just seven seconds behind.
“I think the team raced the best race they could this past weekend,” freshman heavyweight Katherine Playfair said. “We all know that we have technical focuses, both individually and team-wide, that we need to improve on, and we have the time and determination to make those changes for the future.”
The lightweight team had a more successful start, extending its dual-race win streak to 18 and taking the Class of 2004 Cup in Washington, D.C. Both the V8 and JV teams overcame whitecaps, rollers and tail currents and winds in the Potomac River to best Georgetown’s first varsity team.
In the only race that was able to finish, the first varsity team won with a time of 6:53.30. The second varsity team finished exactly five seconds and one boat length later at 6:58.30, and Georgetown rounded out the three, finishing a little over five seconds later.
“Given the results from this past weekend, I find that our team is strong, but we have a long way to go to feel fully prepared for the Ivy Championships,” Playfair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its Ivy League openers, the No. 36 Harvard men’s tennis team split a hotly contested pair of matches this weekend, taking down No. 55 Cornell, 4-3, on Saturday, but falling short against No. 28 Columbia on Sunday.
Seven of the eight Ivy squads are ranked nationally, and the No. 36 Crimson (15-6, 1-1 Ivy) started its season quickly with the Big Red and Lions (10-5, 3-0), last season’s defending champions and presumptive favorites.
“[The Cornell match] was a great match for us,” co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “We were a little rusty in spots, so [we] got that out of the system. Even though we lost today, we played a much better match than against Cornell, so are happy about that.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 2
In front of a raucous crowd at the Murr Center, Harvard kicked off its conference slate with one of its biggest matches of the year. Last season, Columbia snatched the Ivy crown from Harvard after the Crimson took home the title in 2012 and 2013.
Although Columbia entered the weekend at just 8-5, the record was perhaps misleading, with the Lions having faced eight top-25 teams on the year. After Sunday’s victory, Columbia has three Ivy wins on the season.
In doubles, Harvard started out fast, as sophomore Brian Yeung and co-captain Denis Nguyen seized control of a hotly contested match, putting away an overhead to close out the match on the first court, 6-2. But sophomore Sebastian Beltrame and junior Nicky Hu went down, 6-3, on court two, leaving the match up to Steinroeder and junior Kelvin Lam at third doubles. Lam helped save a few match points, but Columbia eventually closed out the 6-3 victory to take the 1-0 lead.
“[Losing the doubles point] changes everything,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “Against a team that good, it’s hard to come back from. That gave them enormous confidence going into singles.”
The Lions came out firing in singles, as they took each of the six first sets. The Crimson fought back in the second sets, as Steinroeder and Hu won on courts five and two, respectively, and Beltrame saved match point to take the second set, 7-5, sending the crowd into a frenzy.
Eventually, Harvard pushed the Lions to five third sets. But Nguyen fell, 7-5, 6-3, to Columbia’s Winston Lin, ranked 21st nationally, to put Harvard down, 2-0. When Hu went down, 6-2, in the third set, the Crimson was on the brink. Steinroeder’s 6-4 loss in the third provided the final margin of victory.
“It was really cool to see everyone fight back after losing the first sets,” Steinroeder said. “It would’ve been easy to go down after that, and it was really good to force five third sets.... Everyone’s happy with the way they competed today.”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 3
In Saturday’s match, the Crimson’s freshmen helped put the team over the top to deliver a victory in its Ivy season opener.
The Big Red, which opened its Ancient Eight season with a 6-1 loss to the Lions last weekend, put up a strong fight, but Harvard was able to slip by.
In doubles, Harvard’s top tandems carried it to victory, taking victories on the top two courts with identical 6-4 marks.
Hu extended the Crimson’s lead with a 6-4, 7-5 victory at No. 2, but with Cornell taking early leads at the other slots, the match remained very much up in the air.
The Big Red eventually tied up the match at 2, and after Yeung was swept on court three, 5-4, 6-4, Harvard stood on the brink of defeat. But Nguyen closed out his match, 7-6, 6-3, leaving the result up to the freshman Kenny Tao on court six.
After rebounding from a 3-6 loss in the first set, Tao closed out Cornell senior Alex Sidney to give Harvard the win.
“Kenny fought back against a seasoned, tough player,” Fish said. “He found the right strategy to play against him, which was great.”
The Crimson still has some kinks to work out, primarily at third doubles, where it started two different lineups this weekend.
“It’s been a struggle trying to figure out the right team,” said Steinroeder, who competed at third doubles against the Lions. “We played well, but have had some trouble in that spot. Hopefully, results will start coming.”
In the meantime, Harvard will continue to compete for the Ivy crown, and its NCAA hopes remain alive.
“If we were ranked much lower, our NCAA hopes would be over,” Fish said. “But they’re not. If we continue to play well like we have, we can easily still make the NCAA Tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long respite from tournament competition, the Harvard women’s golf team travelled to the Ole Miss Golf Course in Oxford, Miss., for the Rebel Intercollegiate and came away with a 14th place finish against top-tier competition. Each of the top four finishing schools came into the tournament ranked among the top 20 teams in the nation, and two schools finished under par for the three-day, three-round competition.“We always love coming to this tournament and playing against strong teams,” junior Christine Lin said. “We have spring break and then we had a week in Boston where we didn’t get to go outside and play, so it was really nice to get back into the groove and see how our games are among the teams and how are games are in a tournament situation.”Anne Cheng, who took the Ivy League Championship title as a freshman and was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, led the Crimson with a 37th-place finish. The sophomore from Torrance, Calif., shot nine over par for her weekend and also had the Crimson’s only single round under par. “This weekend I came into [the tournament]...and didn’t know what to expect, so once I started to play on the course, I was just taking my shots and then evaluat[ing] what I needed to work on,” Cheng said. “My playing style was a little bit different each day...so I’m still a little inconsistent, but I’m working on it.”Though Cheng’s clean second round saw her notch 17 pars and a birdie, the sophomore wasn’t necessarily completely satisfied with the effort.“On day two, my iron shots and my driver shots were very consistent—and accurate,” Cheng said. “I would say that there were so many pars because my putting was off...it was a missed opportunity, but I’m happy with the round.”Joining Cheng in the top-50 individually was Lin, who had rounds of plus-3, plus-5, and plus-3, respectively. The junior found success in making sure that her mistakes didn’t snowball, as she avoided carding a double-bogey or worse in all 54 holes.Despite her solid play, Lin admitted that there were still some room for improvement. “On the surface, it appeared pretty consistent, but I think the first day I struggled the most with my swing,” Lin said. “I think my mental ability to stay patient was pretty good, and that’s what allowed me to save a lot of pars and get up and down all over the place.”Elsewhere on the course, freshman Lita Guo demonstrated promise in her second tournament for the team. Guo saved her best for last with a two over par performance on day three, a round in which inexperienced golfers unused to the marathon-like nature of three-round tournaments are prone to struggling due to fatigue.After not carding a birdie through her first two rounds, Guo shot two under par on the front nine of her final 18 to put a nice finishing touch on her second collegiate tournament appearance.“I think she really had a good time and found things she needed to work on, and I think she’s working on them correctly,” Lin said. “She’s learning a lot from the college tournaments and from us, and she’s moving in a good direction.”While Nina Fairbairn had a rough second round with a team-worst 87 on the par-72 course on day two, the sophomore bounced back with a 73 on the final day, which was the lowest score for each of the five Crimson competitors.“On any given day we reset and every day is different,” Lin said. “It’s very possible that each of us can go low on one day…. It was cool to see her bounce back, taking things day by day and shot by shot.”Though the Crimson was only 14 strokes off the leading pace after day one, the Harvard women did not come closer to reaching the podium in the next two days. However, it’s best day came on Sunday, when the squad broke the 300 stroke mark as a team with a cumulative day three score of 298.—Staff writer Caleb Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing their rigorous travel schedule, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams divided and conquered yet again, with members traveling throughout the nation.
While a few members stayed close to home and traveled to Princeton, N.J., to partake in the Sam Howell Invite, others traveled south to compete against the best in the nation at the Florida Relays.
FLORIDA RELAYS
Competing in a field packed with potential All-Americans, national championship contenders, and former Olympians, the Crimson athletes proved they could race with the best while obtaining solid results.
Captain Jarvis Harris rewrote the program record book in the 110 meter hurdles, clocking in with a time of 14.05, besting the previous top mark by just under .1 seconds and taking home a top-25 finish. Harris also took home a 53.69 finish in the 400-meter hurdles.
Though the performance earned Harris a record, the senior believes there is room for improvement since he clocked in at 13.80 last year at the LSU Gold Alumni meet in the same event. The time was not considered official due to the wind speed being over two miles.
“[The mark] definitely shows I’m moving in the right direction,” Harris said. “I’m looking forward to the next few weeks, getting back to that mark and even exceeding that previous mark…as we move toward the Ivy League championships and beyond.”
Rookie Malcolm Johnson opened up his first outdoor campaign by becoming just the second Ancient Eight runner to clock in under 11 seconds in the 100 meter dash this year, finishing with a mark of 10.92.
Harris, Johnson, freshman Matthew Hurst and classmate Alexander Moore teamed up to compete in the 4 x 100 and 4 x 200 relays as well, finishing with times of 41.84 and 1:26.28.
The distance runners left their mark as well, as senior Molly Renfer, junior Paige Kouba and sophomore Sarah Gillespie all finished in the top-10 in the women’s 1500 meter run, placing fifth, sixth and 10th with times of 4:22.48, 4:25.66 and 4:26.49, respectively.
On the male side of the event, seniors Connor Reck and Nephat Maratim obtained personal records with finishes of 3:49.39 and 3:52.91. The teammates finished in ninth and 18th place, respectively.
The results weren’t limited to the track, as the field athletes also helped strengthen Harvard’s performance.
Senior Hannah Meyer threw a 48.52-meter mark in the javelin, good enough for sixth overall, while sophomore Raegan Nizdil finished in a five-way tie for ninth in the high jump with a 1.68-meter leap.
With such steep competition, head coach Jason Saretsky believes the meet provided a pivotal opportunity for the program to maintain focus while also gaining valuable experience.
“It’s big to get that exposure, it’s big to get out of our comfort zone,” Saretsky said. “We can get a little bit used to being here in the northeast and seeing the same competition, so it’s always good to mix things up.”
SAM HOWELL INVITE
Competing at the home of Ivy League rival Princeton, the Crimson notched various top-10 finishes and personal records at the Sam Howell Invite. The meet allowed several of the younger athletes to obtain their own experience leading up to the championship portion of the season.
“For some of those younger kids, it’s great for them to continue to develop and get some good race experience and continue to build so they can help contribute to the team.” Saretsky said.
The distance runners continued their impressive weekend, as freshman Gabe Montague claimed fifth in the 800-meter run and 10th in the 1,500-meter race.
On the women’s side, rookie Sarah Angell placed fourth in the 800-meter race, while classmate Elianna Shwayder finished in seventh in the 5,000-meter competition with a time of 17:10.11. Junior Emma Payne finished with a personal-best and 11th-place 17:37.42 mark in the same race.
The field component saw various personal marks fall, highlighted by sophomore Joshua Whitener’s 59.71 mark in the hammer throw. The throw was good for second place and was over six feet farther than Whitener’s previous best.
The record breaking continued, as sophomore Julian Nunally finished sixth in the shot put with a mark of 15.98 meters.
Rookie Matt Miller claimed fourth in the pole vault with a height of 4.70 meters, a personal record. On the women’s side, classmate Marlena Sabatino and junior Lexie Schachne each finished in the top five with a mark of 3.50 meters. The mark tied Schachne’s personal record.
In the sprint events, junior Mark Hill took home a personal record and fourth-place finish in the 110-meter hurdles at 15.21 seconds, while sophomore David Fan placed 10th in the 100-meter dash.
The team now turns its attention to its only home meet of the season, as Harvard will welcome Yale to the McCurdy Outdoor Track on Saturday.
The meet promises to be an exciting one, with athletes from both schools competing for the opportunity to qualify and represent a joint Harvard-Yale squad at the biannual meet against Oxford-Cambridge that will be hosted across the pond this summer.
“Both Harvard and Yale are definitely looking forward to bringing the heat for this meet,” Harris said. “Not only do we like competitions amongst ourselves, but we definitely want to extend that competition into this summer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sailing made waves at four different regattas, ending the weekend with three top-three finishes. The team sent contingents to the 34th Lynne Marchiando Regatta, the BU Trophy Race, Central Series 3, and the Dellenbaugh Women's Trophy.
LYNNE MARCHIANDO REGATTA
No. 9 Crimson had its third-consecutive second place finish against a field of nationally-ranked competitors at the Lynne Marchiando Regatta hosted by MIT. Racing in FJs and NC Fireflies, Harvard fell short to Yale, finishing with a 12-3 record overall.
After going the first day with no losses and in first place, the Crimson saw its lead disappear, losing races to No. 3 Boston College, No. 10 Stanford, and No. 8 Roger Williams. But even with the podium-topping overall score lost to the Bulldogs, Harvard still managed to beat Yale on the water, finishing 1-3-6 in its team race against the top-ranked team.
“We've been putting in a lot of work in practice and that has shown in our past few weekends,” freshman crew Kevin Coakley said. “We have a group of very capable sailors.”
The weather also provided a significant challenge, with gusts over 40 knots forcing sailors to use storm jibs and reefed mainsails. During the first day of racing, competition was postponed due to wind. Even on Sunday, the gusts averaged in the 20s.
This Crimson group brought a large contingent of six skippers and seven crew to the regatta, and it changed up its lineups frequently.
“We kept changing combinations and creating new pairings to adjust as best as we could,” Coakley said. “We tried to match the opposing team's weight combinations so we wouldn't be mismatched if the conditions changed quickly.”
BU TROPHY RACE
A smaller Harvard contingent took first at the BU Trophy Race, a little farther down the Charles River.
The pair of freshman skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj sailed in FJs in the A division, coming in first with a mere eight points. In the B division, sophomore skipper Bennett Capozzi and sophomore crew Olivia Kjorlein came in eighth, but their score of 21 kept the Crimson in first.
Harvard competed in a field of sixteen NEISA schools, including Yale, No. 5 Tufts, and MIT.
The sailors also experienced high winds and racing had to be canceled on Saturday after numerous boats capsized.
CENTRAL SERIES 3
The Crimson maintained its stellar weekend record with another second-place finish at the Central Series 3, hosted by Harvard. Teams sailed in FJs.
The Harvard squad finished behind Salve Regina in the pool of 11 NEISA competitors. The freshman duo of skipper Dylan Farrell and crew Kirstin Anderson took fourth and sixth in the two A division races that took place. In the B division, junior skipper Adam Brodheim and freshman crew Ariana Gross finished first and sixth, respectively, making the Crimson’s combined score of 13 good enough for second.
"I thought the racing went pretty well," Farrell said. "We did a good job staying flat and fast upwind and were able to get through the day without capsizing once. As always, we could improve on our starts, which were not great in the first two races."
Each duo as only allowed to compete in two races, as the contests were called early due to wind, capsizes, and risk of hypothermia.
DELLENBAUGH WOMEN’S TROPHY
While the remainder of the team stayed to compete on the local Charles, four female members of the team headed to Providence, RI, where they earned 13th place out of a pool of 18, sailing in 420s. Host Brown took first, while other Ancient Eight members No. 1 Yale and No. 5 Dartmouth took fifth and 15th respectively.
The field of competition also included No. 9 Charleston, No. 7 Coast Guard, and No. 8 Bowdoin. Teams also came from as far as California and Florida to compete in the interconference regatta.
Junior skipper Sophie Bermudez and senior crew Ashleigh Inglis held down the A division for the Crimson, finishing in 14th place with 70 points. The tenth place finish earned by freshman skipper Taylor Ladd and junior crew Kristina Jakobson brought the team’s final placement up to 13th.
Even with temperatures in the 50s—slightly warmer than those in Boston—winds and capsizes brought the first day of competition to an early close. However, on Sunday, conditions improved greatly and the winds averaging about 16 knots gave way to a day filled with races.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 54 Harvard women’s tennis team opened its Ivy League slate with two losses this weekend, falling to Cornell on Friday and No. 65 Columbia on Saturday. Despite a handful of strong individual performances, the Crimson (7-7, 0-2 Ivy) fell to both schools by a score of 5-2.
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 2
Following a loss to Cornell, the Crimson fell yet again on Saturday, dropping to 0-2 in the Ancient Eight. Similar to the previous day of action, Harvard's two points came from singles play. Sophomore Monica Lin and freshman Nikki Kallenberg recorded wins for the Crimson, with the rookie winning her second and third sets despite losing, 1-6, in the first set to Columbia’s Kanika Vaidya. Kallenberg's come-from-behind win was the first singles win for the Crimson, marking her sixth victory in her last seven outings. Lin closed out the singles matches with a straight-set victory over her opponent—her 12th individual win of the season.
However, Columbia (10-6, 2-1) earned its victory in a similar fashion to Cornell—both picked up two wins in the doubles flight and never lost their leads throughout singles play. The Crimson faltered in its singles matches as three out of its four losses came in straight sets.
CORNELL 5, HARVARD 2
On Friday, Lin and freshman Annika Ringblom won both their singles matches at the second and fourth positions, respectively. The duo also played together at the top doubles position, earning an 8-4 victory over its opponents.
Lin won her singles match against Cornell’s Alexandra D’Ascenzo in straight sets, 7-6 (5), 6-2, while Ringblom posted a convincing 6-1, 6-2 victory.
Despite the individual successes, the Crimson could not keep pace with the Big Red (8-6, 2-0). Cornell started off the match by jumping out to a 1-0 lead after winning in both the second and third doubles slots. Harvard continued to play from behind, eventually falling, 5-2.
Although juniors Amy He and Amanda Lin both fought to win a set in the last two singles matches, they were ultimately defeated by Priyanka Shah and Jane Stewart of Cornell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team almost managed to garner a series sweep of both Princeton and Cornell this past Saturday and Sunday at O’Donnell Field. However, the Big Red managed to come away with a 5-4 victory in the second game on Sunday.
The late loss against Cornell did not reflect the rest of the weekend. The Crimson (14-13, 3-5 Ivy) beat the Tigers (5-20, 2-6) on Saturday, 8-1 and 11-8, and started off Sunday with a resounding 14-2 win against the Big Red (8-16, 5-3).
CORNELL 5, HARVARD 4
After the first game of the doubleheader saw the Crimson erupt for 14 runs, the second contest against Cornell featured strong defensive and pitching efforts through the first four innings from both teams, leaving the score knotted at zero. The Big Red produced the first runs of the contest, scoring three runs on four hits in the top of the fifth.
Harvard responded with one run in the bottom half of the inning, but Cornell tacked on another score in both the seventh and the eighth. But faced with a four-run deficit heading into the final frame, the Crimson rallied in the bottom of the ninth.
Junior pitcher Matt Sanders, who came on as a pinch runner, scored to cut the gap to two on a hit by senior outfielder Jack Colton, and rookies John Fallon and Conor Quinn touched home on the ensuing at-bat as a result of a fielder’s choice and an error by the Big Red defense. However, Cornell was able to stop the last minute rally, leaving senior outfielder Mike Martin stranded at third and earning the series split.
“It was nice to see us get a little rally going in the ninth inning,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “Unfortunately we fell a little short…but we definitely have to hold our heads high for winning three out of the four.”
HARVARD 14, CORNELL 2
The Crimson went on to continue its succession of wins after the sweep of Princeton by starting the first game against the Big Red with bats blazing, generating 11 hits in the first three innings.
Although the fifth inning saw Cornell score two runs, the Crimson clinched the victory with another three innings of strong hitting, bringing up the final score to 14-2.
Hitting out of the third spot of the lineup, McGuiggan went 3-for-4 with four runs and three runs batted in as Harvard scored the first 11 runs of the game and never looked back.
HARVARD 11, PRINCETON 8
Harvard topped Princeton twice on Saturday by notching 19 runs on 30 hits to complete its first Ivy League series sweep since its season in 2010.
The second game was much closer in score than the first. The Crimson broke open the scoring with four runs on five hits in the bottom of the second. Senior Ethan Ferreira, junior Mitch Klug, Fallon, and Quinn all knocked in runs, bringing the score to 4-0. The next few innings were relatively quiet, with only one run being scored by Princeton in the fifth inning. Despite multiple hits from Harvard, the Crimson stranded multiple runners in the contest.
“We tend to get off to a slow start in the second game,” Fallon said. “We came out swinging in the first game [and] got a lot of runs…but the second game, we [got] a little flat.”
The game ended with exciting eighth and ninth innings, highlighted by seven Harvard runs in the bottom of the eighth alone. The Tigers attempted their second rally of the day, responding to Harvard’s string of hits with some of their own. Princeton scored five runs on three hits in the ninth, but the Crimson’s sweep was preserved after Harvard junior Joey Sliepka induced a game-ending grounder in the final moments.
HARVARD 8, PRINCETON 1
The Crimson began the opener against the Tigers by scoring eight runs in the first five innings with no offensive response from Princeton’s offense. The Tigers prevented a shutout by plating a run in the sixth inning, but Harvard emerged victorious with 13 hits to Princeton’s four.
Junior designated hitter DJ Link had three hits—including two two-baggers—in four at bats along with two runs and two RBI. On the mound, sophomore right-hander Nick Gruener earned his third win of the season, going the distance and recording seven strikeouts.

Dear Harvard Community,
On behalf of our basketball program, thank you again for the incredible support that you have shown to our basketball team all season long—and particularly as our season finished with the Ivy Playoff game and NCAA Tournament trip!   It was an amazing and exciting journey, and we know you were with us every step of the way.  We feel privileged to be a part of this community with you, and we were honored to represent Harvard over the past weeks.
We were thrilled to have so many Harvard friends with us in Jacksonville for the NCAA game, and we were especially moved by the Harvard turnout in the Palestra for the Ivy Playoff!  It felt like a Harvard home game, and we can’t thank you enough for making the trip to be a part of that special moment with us.
To the band, cheer teams, faculty, staff and all members of the Harvard Community, THANK YOU for making this another incredibly exciting and historic season, as we made our 4th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance and claimed our 5th consecutive Ivy League title.  Thank you for being an invaluable part of our team!
As always, a very special THANK YOU to our students!  They continue to fight for our team in a positive manner that is truly representative of this great institution.  I continue to be very proud of what you do—and how you do it.  And again, we can’t thank you enough for inspiring us to victory in Philadelphia this year!
Congratulations!!  Thank you!!  And Go Crimson!

Happy Easter! Hopefully you’ve gorged yourself on enough Peeps and chocolate bunnies to give you a sugar high that will last you until the end of this mess of a semester (putting the “mess” in semester -- get it?). Summer is rapidly approaching -- for better or for worse. Here are some of the annoying things that come with the onset of summer:
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
With highs of 54 degrees and lows of 43 degrees, it’s practically high summer. Except, at this point in April, it is really supposed to be high summer -- or some weather that doesn’t call for more than two layers of clothing. Also don’t plan on buying sunglasses anytime soon, because we probably won’t be seeing the sun all of this week.
IN THE D-HALL
Lunch:
Chicken Fingers
Farfale with Italian Sausage and Kale
Tofu Parmesan Sub
Dinner:

3) EdX Settles with Department of Justice: “EdX, an online learning platform that Harvard co-founded with MIT in 2012, entered into a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice on Thursday and will address alleged violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That settlement could come to bear on a separate but similar lawsuit against Harvard that revolves around issues of accessibility online.”
IN SPORTS

Welcome to our new series, the Flyby Matchmaker! We're sending Harvard students out on blind dates and then reporting about it (interested?), and we're excited to present our first pairing!
Doni L. Lehman is a sophomore in Dunster House concentrating in economics with a secondary in ethnicity, migration, rights. Seth V. Neel is a senior in Quincy House concentrating in mathematics with a secondary in statistics. They both love brunch, the outdoors and said Spice was their go-to place in the Square. We sent them to Café Pamplona last Tuesday night.
Doni: "I was there first. I sat down facing the door. I was sort of on my phone. He walked in and immediately walked over to me."
Seth: "I was probably five minutes late. She was the only one sitting alone so I just went up to her and was like, 'Are you here for the Flyby thing?' And she was like, 'Yup.'"
Doni: "I hadn’t seen him before. I didn’t know him."
Seth: "I hadn’t seen her [before] at all."
Doni: "He seemed like the typical Harvard student. Had a backpack and was wearing a flannel… he seemed casual which was nice."
Seth: "She was well dressed. I guess I went in with an open mind so nothing would surprise me that much, but she was cool."
 Doni: "He ordered a coffee and rum cake."
Seth: "She ordered an espresso."
Doni: "We talked about his final club, what he’d do next year and what it’s like having a twin on campus. We talked about kind of everything, the most random stuff."
Seth: "We talked about where we were from, what we do at Harvard. We have some mutual friends. She’s in the Sab so we talked about that for a while. We were talking a lot about the other people in Pamplona because it was a really interesting crew there. It got past the typical Harvard conversation relatively quickly."
Doni: "I’d say the most awkward part for me was when a guy sat down really close to me. And he honestly smelled so bad. And my eyes started to water and I didn’t want to look like I was getting emotional talking about potential PhD programs so I just had to avoid eye contact. But I also didn’t want to say anything because I didn’t want to be rude or judgmental."
Seth: "[there wasn’t an awkward part] unless she said there was. Oh yeah, apparently [the guy next to her] smelled really badly, but I couldn’t smell him. So that was only awkward for her I think."
Doni: "[The best part was] trying to take the pic for Flyby."
Seth: "Taking the selfie was funny. We did one where I pretended I was going to kiss her on the cheek and she looked at me like I was a freak."
Doni: "Yes, definitely [I’d recommend this to someone else]. It was really casual. I think we both had a fun time just doing it and getting to know someone in a one-on-one context when it’s not weird because that’s the pretense for you being there… and so it was a really good way to get to know someone on a more personal level that I’m not sure happens very often at Harvard, especially with the house system when you are usually at meals with people you know already."
Seth: "Yeah for sure [I’d recommend it]. At the very least you’ll make a new friend… it definitely wasn’t that datey. It was an in-between. The thing that puts pressure on a date is that you both asked each other to be there, but if it’s a blind date, it’s not that awkward."
So what’s the future of their relationship?
They became Facebook friends and messaged back and forth in anticipation of reporting back to the Matchmaker. He says, “I feel like it could be a jumping off point for whatever, but it will probably depend on future interactions.” She says, “Our final clubs are having dinner in a couple weeks so we’ll see each other there!”
Sounds good to us!
