After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than a year of imprisonment in an Iranian jail, Sarah E. Shourd is finally able to come back to the United States. The young woman, along with two other American citizens, was captured in June 2009 by the Iranian police for illegally trespassing the Iranian border while on a supposed hike in the Iraqi mountains. Last week, the Iranian government decided to release the woman—who recently developed both a lump in her breast and precancerous cervical cells—upon the payment of a $500,000 bail. Despite the negative incentive—for others to demand high bails in exchange for prisoners—that might arise from accepting the deal proposed by the Iranian government, paying the bail was the right decision.
Getting a citizen back from a country that is holding her prisoner, especially when the detainee is in extremely poor health and runs the risk of becoming incurable, is worth $500,000. There is a worry that paying the bail will lead to a slippery slope, with the Iranian government asking more and more money in exchange for the release of other prisoners accused of all sorts of misconduct. This possibility might indeed become reality, but in the present circumstance it is worth allowing a seriously ill American citizen back to the United States. Naysayers must keep in mind that, in the future, steps can be taken in order to make a situation like the present one less likely to happen, and thus responding to the bail request in this instant is not necessarily a step toward perpetual payments to Iran.
Although we are glad Shourd is returning to the U.S., it is worth noticing that if the hikers were near the Iranian border, they behaved extremely irresponsibly as they completely disregarded the travel warning issued by the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs. According to the Bureau, people should avoid all but essential travel within Iraq; had the hikers been more cautious about their vacation destination, this regrettable situation would not have arisen.
It is also necessary to keep in mind that if the hikers did indeed cross the Iranian border, it was within the purview of the Iranian government to arrest them. The legitimacy of the hikers’ arrest, however, does not in any way justify the fact that the prisoners were detained for more than a year without a trial. The slow procedure of the Iranian judiciary system was wrong and should be condemned. Nevertheless, the appraisal of unidentified foreigners who crossed the Iranian border was legitimate, according to the laws of the country—and it is a practice that might lawfully be enforced again. In the future, travelers should be more careful.
Paying the bail for Shourd leaves, however, a very problematic issue on the table: the future of the other two hikers who are still held captive. As a condition of the money transfer, more information about the other two prisoners and about the prospects for their trial should be requested. In the best-case scenario, Shourd’s liberation might ease the release process of her companions. In the meantime, Shourd will be able to come back to the U.S., where she will receive all the treatments that she needs. After all, $500,000 is not too high a price for a life.

Schadenfreude. Sunday’s New York Times article on the process of “de-partnering” at Goldman Sachs inevitably has triggered gloating among its competitors and critics alike. As author Charles D. Ellis’s “The Partnership” revealed in 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs like the rest of Wall Street is still run by a small group of “rainmakers” at the pinnacle of its organizational hierarchy: “the partners.” This process to “partner” is analogous to the process of receiving tenure in academia: both promotions seek to reward achievement and past performance.
Goldman Sachs and other firms with steps to removing partners deserve approval for maintaining such a strong sense of “revolving door” review because partnership, like tenure, presents many problems when unchecked. In most systems of review, there exists an inconsistency between the past actions for which partnership or tenure is bestowed and the future expectations for a partnered individual at the institution. Goldman understood that partnership should not be seen as a reward but rather as an investment opportunity to gain from an individual’s leadership in the institution or firm. The lessons Goldman learned might now be applied usefully to academia, where the “tenure” model of job promotion is riddled with the same issues that Goldman’s old partnership model was; it promotes good researchers and intellectuals who are not necessarily good professors or true leaders.
The partnership model depends far too wholly on past output. Its design is based on the moral-hazard problem in contract theory economics, which is solved by using output as a proxy for effort, which cannot be directly measured. In the corporate setting, this output is signaled through deal flow or revenue generation for the firm. In academia, reward is most measurably a function of research and publications. These assumptions rely on the fallacies that deal flow or published papers directly reflect an individual’s promise as partner or professor that they may not. The economic model from which this result is derived is far too trivial to be applied this generally.
Furthermore, it is not necessarily true that such observable outputs are the right proxies for effort. While convenient to base uncertain decisions about the future on past observation, incentives do usually change when tenure is granted. This point needs no belaboring, but tenure schemes should incorporate this fact, accounting for future promise rather than bookkeeping the past. While a professor is promised intellectual freedom once granted tenure, there is an overwhelming sense of security that accompanies this which may reflect negatively on a professor’s responsibilities to the University, namely advisory or teaching roles for graduate and undergraduate students, administrative roles in a lab or research program, and leadership positions on University-wide committees.
While those granted tenure or partner status are expected to be the ones with the institution’s long-term goals most in mind, the process in place today requires greater detail to short-term gains or wayward attention to the politics of the tenure system in order to receive tenure. On Wall Street, irresponsibility accompanies the desire to make short-term profits, and the individuals most in a position to become managing partners in the near-future are not, however, equipped to think much further ahead than their tenure decisions.
The challenges to measuring excellence in finance parallel those in academia, but instead of viewing tenure as a career capstone, it should be seen as only the start of an individual’s true contributions to an academic institution. Academics who are most fit to successfully fill all the roles that professors play should be given this opportunity sooner. This implies either the need to reevaluate the standards on which universities base tenure reviews, moving away from the model of rewards for past “output” or to eliminate it entirely and smooth the organizational hierarchy of academia institutions. Maybe, this time, Goldman had it right.

Under the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act, illegal immigration to the U.S. is punishable by deportation, and anyone who aids or abets illegal immigrants in working and residing in the U.S. is subject to fines, imprisonment, and forfeiture of vehicles and property used to commit the crime. Sixty-eight percent of Americans believe that “immigration reform should primarily move in the direction of stricter enforcement of laws against illegal immigration,” according to a September Quinnipiac  University poll. No matter how one thinks illegal immigrants should be treated once in the U.S., most Americans can agree that the act of entering a country without the proper legal permits is, in fact, a crime.
This is something that the three American hikers who crossed into Iran illegally should have known, and their ignorance or negligence of commonplace international law should not jeopardize the ongoing delicate geopolitical negotiations between America and Iran. Therefore, the American government should not have demanded the release of Sharon E. Shourd and her companions, but should have sufficed itself with insisting that they be detained in a humane way.
Shourd and her hiking companions, Shane M. Baeur and Joshua F. Fattal, were hiking in the mountains of Northern Iraq when arrested. Anyone who travels to another country is responsible for obeying its laws, and the hikers should have had adequate maps or technology with them. Assuming that the three are not American spies as some Iranian politicians have claimed, the travelers should have been more vigilant about where they were hiking. In such dangerous territory, they had a legal responsibility to be especially careful.
Protesting the Iranian government’s strict policing of its border with a troublesome neighbor is not just hypocritical on the U.S.’s part but also detrimental to the integrity of the relationship between the two countries. The U.S. was a main proponent of the new round of United Nations sanctions that were placed on Iran in June. At the time, President Barack H. Obama remarked, “The Iranian government must understand that true security will not come through the pursuit of nuclear weapons. True security will come through adherence to international law and the demonstration of its peaceful intent.” Why should Iran be humbled by the citation of international law in one case if the U.S. chooses to argue outside of it in another?
It is understandable that the American government is worried about the conditions of its citizens at the hands of an antagonist, and nothing should stop the White House from demanding humane treatment for its citizens abroad, in line with international human-rights law. However, some individuals will always take unconscientious actions that jeopardize larger geopolitical goals. In March 2009 two reporters were arrested after illegally crossing into North   Korea for a broadcast piece. In May 2009 an American man swam across a lake to the house of Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, providing the country’s rulers with an excuse to disqualify her from the upcoming national elections. The U.S. should take the lead in maintaining in the international arena that governments are not responsible for the actions of private citizens and that geopolitical interests should be governed by less petty things than the recklessness of some individuals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Abandon yourself for a moment and leave everything behind. No showers. No toilets. No running water. Rags for clothes. Fences made of wood and barbed wire. Dusty dirt roads and sparsely scattered homes. Welcome to Uta, a small village in the Mpumalanga region of South Africa.
While immersing myself in the life of rural South Africa, at times I struggled to see the big picture. All I knew was what my internship requested of me: I practiced ethnography, interviewing locals through a translator on their lives, skills, and hopes. I experienced a foreign culture and a lifestyle where daily life revolved around finding water, cooking food, herding animals, playing soccer, and dancing in church. I learned a new language, Xitsonga, and I learned how to consult and organize community members on forming sustainable businesses and student groups, first by watching, and then by doing.
Yet my primary motivation to go to South Africa was not to practice ethnography, experience new cultures, learn new languages, or learn community organizing. I went to South Africa to learn how to do development work, and what I found is development work is not straightforward and not what I expected.
You can get self-satisfaction from going into a poor village, making direct contributions, and seeing the concrete change you contributed to in a few weeks. Libraries, soccer fields, bakeries or classrooms; these are lacking in poor communities, and occasionally an NGO will go in and build them. But what good is a library if it is not operated or used? What good is a classroom if the education system is failing because students cannot read their English textbooks, and girls must cook, clean, and wheelbarrow water for miles every day after school? What good is a bakery if the leader of the local government pockets all the profits, and there is a shortage of flour to turn into bread? What good is a soccer field if no one will maintain it in a village that lacks health and jobs? And what good is teaching if there is no teacher to replace you once you leave?
These are problems that many NGO’s doing development work face, and they are the same problems that Think Impact, the nonprofit I worked for, struggled to come to terms with since it started working in these communities in 2002. Year after year they built libraries and soccer fields; they ran health camps and gave out scholarships. But once they left so did their contributions: buildings deteriorate, lessons are forgotten, and life is back to how it was before.
A year before I arrived, Think Impact changed its approach from one of needs-based service to one of asset-based community development, which uses the community’s skills, resources, and crucially, ideas, to facilitate the creation of sustainable, profit-driven projects with social benefits that locals personally create, lead, and have investment in. Once the project, like a hair salon or tutoring program, succeeds in sustaining itself independently, Think Impact fundraises and helps scale it.
This can create a powerful change in a community where people do not take initiative outside of their daily routine, lack outside information, and have no access to jobs. The first week I arrived, a man named Lucky asked me, “What are you building for us this time around? We need a shopping mall.” I shrugged. They were going to come up with the ideas, plans, and resources, and we were going to help them implement them, I told him.
I did not leave Uta, South Africa, having painted a school or taught English. Two months gave me time to learn about the people and issues, to empower and create partnerships between village members. Now that I’m no longer there, I must count on those working on the ground to continue my work and for those in the village to be invested in improving themselves. And again, the question remains: Can this make a dent in the structural root of the problem? In a sense, it does.
The unfortunate truth that hit me throughout the nine weeks I spent in the village is that in communities with a long history of poverty, any hope of improving people’s health, education, and livelihood will not rely on a replicable formula. The immediate self-gratification of seeing your own concrete work when doing temporary service in poor communities has little role in sustainable development. Sustainable development may take generations. Yet I could not ask for more; the raw tumble of joy, outrage, and compassion I felt every day, and the understanding that it is only through partnership and solidarity with others that you will be able to help them help themselves.

Shalini Pammal needs to offer a snapshot of her life in 140 characters or less via Twitter. Shalini Pammal can then share what she is thinking in the latest Google Buzz invention, in addition to echoing similar sentiments in a Facebook status update and a Google Chat status. The social media update onslaught has reached such an unnecessary level that we are not only updating the virtual world of the slightest changes (or continuing monotony) in our lives, but now we also have multiple venues to repeatedly express such sentiments.
Most of us have shared some information on one of these social-networking sites that should have been communicated to specific individuals, rather than an entire online population of acquaintances, and people with whom we don’t routinely speak (and who don’t necessarily care about our numerous qualms and pangs of conscience).  
Log onto any of these popular social networking websites and you’re bound to be immediately notified of the minute-to-minute happenings in the lives of friends, acquaintances, and the occasional person you are only virtually connected to yet have never spoken with before. You have probably seen the informative “is sleeping” or “is bored” update on Facebook, and the even more exciting tweets that chronicle mundane annoyances or sudden (marginally exciting) revelations on Twitter.
While I am a fan of the occasional clever remark or poignant thought posted via social networks and of creating online communities for people to share new ideas, experiences, and advice, it becomes difficult to keep up with the numerous social-media networks available to the modern Internet user. With more than 400 million active users spending over 500 billion minutes per month on Facebook, and with new users signing up on Twitter at a rate of 300,000 per day, is there really a need to “share what you’re thinking” yet again with Google Buzz? The never-ending litany of social updates from multiple sources is simply excessive. Our constant status updating has become a technological diary for sharing the mundane and sometimes personal in our lives even when it need not be shared with virtual communities in numerous different networks.
In addition to the tales of banal routines which garner fleeting publicity via social media status, I have also seen the appearance of the “Like this status and I’ll tell you what I like and dislike about you, my first impression of you, and my confession about you” status. Pervasive across Facebook profiles from time to time, the status seems to solicit numerous “likes” from hopefuls waiting to hear what their virtual friends really think of them. It surprises me that some feel comfortable suddenly sharing what is understood as an initially secret opinion about another, to truth-seeking, online friends, over an outlet so public and accessible to the outsider like Facebook. Perhaps the need-to-know-mentality would be quelled if those status-liking friends heard the unadulterated truth their connections entice them with, through a Facebook status update that can expose “what I really think of you.”
Likewise, as one spills personal feelings, up-to-date actions, and quips about trivial occurrences in day-to-day life, we forget that our close friends are not the only ones who are able to see such status updates. Google Buzz engages the contacts of your entire email base. Facebook friends have become increasingly meaningless. Worst of all, personal tweets can be followed by any of the over 75 million users on Twitter. Your distant online connections don’t need to know that you are “taking a shower” or “going to the gym, tanning, and doing laundry minus the tanning.” The fact that there are so many more social update tools available makes us live our daily lives in an unnecessarily frenzied whirlwind of updates. Why should one need to post thoughts and feelings in so many different media networks in a redundant and needless fashion? It seems as if the simplicity of living in a moment that belongs exclusively to oneself is removed, as the newsfeeds and home pages of numerous online connections are also made aware of minute-to-minute occurrences in others’ lives.
So therefore, Shalini Pammal is not going to tell you what she is doing at this very moment. She’d rather live an experience than post it in a Facebook update, Google Buzz it to everyone she’s ever emailed, or try to squeeze it into a 140 character tweet.

If Friday nights are any indication (whether you’re slaving away in Lamont or drinking away at the Bell Tower), excess at Harvard is not a sin. Students here love to compete and love to win. So what happens when you challenge a handful of them to race across campus and indulge their appetites for hangover HUDS? FM presents Chickwich Challenge 2010: 12 dining halls, 12 chicken patties, one hell of a competition. Last Saturday, five fearless students mustered up the courage to throw down (and throw up) for glory: Johnny F. Bowman ’11, Helen E. Bradshaw ’11, Neil T. Curran ’12, Collin A. Jones ’12, and Matt C. Jones ’12. Their task was simple: to tear through Harvard’s campus, one House dining hall at a time, starting with Currier. The first one to finish a chickwich from the Mather grill would be declared victor, but even reaching Cowperthwaite Street would prove to be more than some could handle.
“Guys. I worked at Chick-fil-A for 18 months. I’m from the dirty South,” Collin A. Jones ’12 said. He was sitting with three other Chickwich Challenge competitors in Currier dining hall, waiting for the contest to begin. “I’m not nervous,” he added. “I’m hungry.”
Paper cups filled with barbecue sauce and water were scattered across the table. It was 11:47 a.m., and 13 minutes remained until the kitchen would open and war could begin. The participants sat, consumed by thoughts of vomiting and victory.
Justin Bieber’s song “Baby” blasted from Collin Jones’ iPhone, and three other competitors began some aerobic stretching to warm up. Johnny F. Bowman ’11, sporting a button-down and a sweat band around his head, arrived carrying six small bowls of various sauces and placed them down at the head of the table. Preparation, it would seem, is everything.
Bowman’s propriety seemed especially absurd when looking at the other contestants. As Collin Jones continued singing along to “JBiebs,” Neil T. Curran ’12 reclined leisurely in the geriatric-chic Currier dining hall. “I normally eat 12 chickwiches on Saturdays, so I’m not nervous,” said Curran.
On the other side of the table, Helen E. Bradshaw ’11, the only female contestant, expressed a bit more concern. “I will probably never eat a chickwich again,” said Bradshaw.
Just before the contest began, the rules were explained to the participants one last time. Matt C. Jones ’12, looking rather enlivened, shouted, “Yes! No buns!” In the crowd of nearby observers, someone asked, “How many chickens do you think that is?” Unclear. But according to FM’s calculations, even without buns, each patty is 250 calories. By the end of the competition, contestants—the successful ones, anyway—consume 3,000 calories in chickwiches.
Some participants had more experience than others. The three participants from Quincy were all members of the “Saturday Lunch Club,” a group devoted to food consumption. Their monthly extreme eating activities include “Kill the Grill,” in which teams of five work together to finish two of each HUDS grill item, and the “Dunkin’ Donuts 5K,” where participants run to the three nearby Dunkin’ Donuts, consuming a set number of doughnuts at each one.
In the final minutes before the competition, the Saturday Lunch Club participants huddled together. Peter D. Davis ’12, a resident of Currier House and Collin Jones’ self-described “eating coach,” announced, “Collin’s gonna win. There’s no point in even covering anyone else.” According to Jones, Davis gives him pep talks and eating exercises. “He took me on pro bono as well,” said Bradshaw.
At 12:03 p.m., the infamous Chickwich Challenge began.
AND THEY’RE OFF
From the start, eating techniques varied among the contestants. Collin Jones, Matt Jones, and Curran folded the hot patties over in their hands, submerged them in water to cool and soften the meat, and practically inhaled the chicken. Bradshaw ripped it with her fingers into smaller scraps. “This will help get it down, guys,” she assured.
Meanwhile, Bowman neatly cut his chickwich into bite-size pieces with a fork and knife, daintily dipping each piece into a different sauce. Bowman’s style stood in stark contrast to that of the rest of the competitors, who finished their chickwiches in a matter of moments.
While Bradshaw and Curran tried to finish their chickwiches (as Bowman made a third cut into his patty), Collin Jones sprinted ahead out of Currier and toward Pforzheimer with Matt Jones closely following him. As crowds of Currierites gathered, Jones and Jones continued sprinting, indifferent to the onlookers and nearly bowling over a few people at the door.
Collin Jones slid into Pfoho, gaining a slight lead as Matt Jones scrambled to find his ID for swiping purposes. Collin’s lead was short-lived, however—once Matt burst into the dining hall, he downed the chickwich effortlessly and bolted through the exit toward Cabot, leaving the other Jones chewing at the table.
Already a full stop behind, Bradshaw meandered into Pfoho as Matt Jones ran out of Cabot in a blur, with Curran and Collin Jones following soon thereafter. “Ew!” shouted a girl in the Cabot dining hall as Curran dipped his third chickwich into a cup of water, swallowed, and went on his way.
As Curran and Collin Jones began their jog, Bradshaw wandered out of Pfoho looking defeated. “I can’t do this. I’m done,” she announced. “I just started eating meat last spring—I was a vegetarian before that. I just can’t do 12. Two chickwiches are enough for me.”
THE LONG TROT
Adams was the first of nine River Houses on the Chickwich Challenge’s route. Three of the contestants made the trek on foot from the Quad to the River, but Bowman was nowhere to be found. “Oh, I saw him slowly strolling from Currier to Pfoho,” Bradshaw recalled when asked where the Pfoho senior and UC President had disappeared to. For the record, FM is still unaware of his whereabouts. He may still be competing.
The stretch between the Quad and civilization is long enough without the shuttle, but unimaginably miserable with a stomach packed tight with chicken patties. Collin Jones later admitted, “I started gagging in some bushes on the run from Cabot.”
Nevertheless, the three remaining contestants rapidly took care of business in Adams and moved on to Quincy. Once the chickwiches were ready at the grill, they began forcing them down. The pace was notably slower now than at the Challenge’s start, but Curran consumed his patty with relative ease. Collin Jones took a little more time, but Matt Jones, looking absolutely sick, ground to a halt.
“He isn’t looking so good,” observed Collin Jones, his expression a mixture of concern and amusement. After a hearty—but ultimately fruitless—attempt at finishing his fifth chickwich, Matt Jones waved the white flag and decided not to continue the competition, leaving only Collin Jones and Curran battling it out for the win.
Curran was the first to arrive at Lowell, gaining a five-minute lead over Collin Jones (who is from here on out the lone Jones in this story). Curran looked visibly frustrated as he waited for the chickwiches to be ready; clearly, he still wasn’t full after finishing five.
Jones ran into the bright yellow dining hall—making sure to swipe first—and struck up a conversation with Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck. “We’re doing the Chickwich Challenge,” he told her.
Her only advice? “Don’t hurt yourself.”
The chickwiches arrived and Curran—having waited a full five minutes—confidently folded the steaming patty and dipped it in a cup of water. He chewed for half a second, swallowing the tough brown disc, and then chugged the remaining water in the cup. With a look of determination, he sprinted off toward Kirkland without Jones. Jones stared at his chickwich for a moment before willing himself to eat it. “I’m gonna throw up in the next few Houses,” he said.
As Jones struggled at Lowell, Curran’s composure in Kirkland and Eliot was so collected that few people in the dining halls seemed to notice that they were witnessing the Chickwich Challenge. At most, they were in awe at the size of Curran’s mouth. How can that much chickwich fit? As Curran exited Eliot, he spotted Jones finally leaving Kirkland, bent over and gasping for air.
“No way, man,” shouted Jones, gaping as Curran sprinted by. Curran continued toward Winthrop, and Jones slowly proceeded into Eliot dining hall. A cluster of girls standing outside the main door asked what he was up to. As Jones took time to explain (and possibly stall), their expressions changed from interest to disgust. “That’s so gross,” said H. Louise Hindal ’12.
Always jogging, Curran ran into Winthrop’s dimly-lit dining hall, looking neither tired nor phased. “Yeah, I’m starting to feel it,” he said, in spite of his composure. While waiting for the patty, Curran refused to sit. He was refusing to lose any momentum. The chickwich arrived, and a moment later he had already finished his eighth patty and turned for the door.
THE FINISH LINE
Before eating his third-to-last patty in Leverett, Curran began to look forward to his next big meal—Sunday brunch, to be precise. With this gastronomical dedication (and shockingly expandable stomach), Curran sauntered toward Dunster, the penultimate stop on the Challenge. Jones was still struggling back in Eliot, attempting to force down another patty.
At 1 p.m., less than an hour after the start of the competition, Curran arrived at Mather, the last and final stop, to eat his 12th chickwich—an unofficial new Chickwich Challenge record.
“This is disgusting,” he admitted.
“So close, Neil, so close,” said one cheery onlooker.
After swallowing his last bite of chickwich, Curran asked for a glass of Powerade. Hydration is important for competitive athletes of every variety. Curran was declared the victor.
A few minutes later, Jones staggered into the Mather dining hall wearing a look of incredulity. He had terminated his run after Winthrop House. “They made me stop. It was for health reasons,” he said. “I was literally hugging the trash can outside Cambridge Commons, gagging with my mouth wide open. Asian tourists were taking pictures of me.”
A dozen chickwiches and 3,000 calories later, Curran, this year’s Chickwich Champion and the Challenge’s new record-holder, was given his prize: a $30 gift certificate to the Kong. Sitting in Mather after taking in more than a day’s calories in under an hour, Curran continued to ponder the next day’s brunch menu. “Oh, but I also have a 10-mile run tomorrow morning, so I’ll have to eat after that,” he remembered. “I’m training for a half-marathon next weekend.”
Jones opened a large bag of Swedish Fish, the prize for the runner-up, and began to chomp loudly. “Anyone want any candy?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite speculation in April of this year, it appears that Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt will not move in to the former location of Alpha Omega Jewelers in Harvard Square—instead, city records indicate that a Starbucks Coffee Company shop may occupy the prominent storefront.
On Thursday, September 30, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals will hold a public hearing to discuss the application for a special permit to convert the retail space at 1380 Mass. Ave.—which has stood empty for two years—into a Starbucks.
According to Elizabeth M. Paden, a land use planner for the Cambridge Community Development Department, Starbucks is considered a “fast order food” establishment, which requires a special permit from the BZA.
“Whether or not it will be granted is hard for me to say,” Paden said. “There’s been no public comment, no public hearing.”
Among several other criteria, including specifics about physical design and community safety standards, the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance stipulates that fast order food establishments must fulfill “a need for such a service in the neighborhood or in the city.”
Given that there are already two other Starbucks stores within 500 feet of the proposed location—one of which was renovated last year—some might question whether such a need exists.
“I guess people need more coffee,” Paden said.
While many Harvard students can be seen toting Starbucks cups across campus, some seem underwhelmed by the possibility of another location in the Square.
Steven Surachman ’11 said a third store, so close to the others, would not be useful, while other students lamented the encroachment of large corporations in the community.
“I’d rather see it be an independent establishment,” Davida Fernandez-Barkan ’11 said.
The managers of Starbucks stores currently located in the Square could not be reached by press time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rumors have surfaced that the Obama administration might appoint Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren as the interim head of the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protectional to avoid a difficult confirmation by the Senate.
White House spokesperson Bill Burton said yesterday that an interim appointment was “certainly an option that the president is considering” and that the president would make an announcement “very soon.”
Warren’s appointment as interim head would allow her to start work immediately, though she would only be able to work until the end of next year as stipulated by the law.
Arianna Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post, said Monday night in Cambridge that her website would soon report that Warren might be appointed “at least interim head” until a permament appointment was decided.
“Elizabeth Warren is the voice of reason in the country,” Huffington said.
Several weeks ago, it was announced that Warren would not be teaching a contracts class this fall, launching rumors that she might be preparing for a move to Washington.
But as of yesterday, Warren was still slated to co-teach “Empirical Analysis of Law” with visiting Law School Professor Lynn M. LoPucki, LoPucki said yesterday afternoon.
The class has only met once so far this year, but Warren was unable to teach that day because she was meeting with President Obama, LoPucki said.
“I’m in uncertainty just as everyone else is,” LoPucki added.
Warren has emerged in recent years as a staunch advocate for consumer protection and the middle class. She is a favorite of liberals but disliked on Wall Street for her tough stance on regulation of financial institutions.
For this reason, Warren’s appointment is likely to spark a heated partisan struggle and a lengthy confirmation process, possibly resulting in a Republican filibuster.
As interim head, Warren could lay the groundwork for the Bureau and run the day-to-day work until she or another nominee is announced as a permanent director.
“I think she would make a great permanent agency head and if that can’t be then I think some sort of temporary appointment would be good for the agency,” LoPucki said. “She’s the person who started all this. She’s the one who believes in the mission.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reforms to the advising structures in the two largest undergraduate concentrations—Economics and Government—have been launched this fall, with the introduction of a dedicated staff concentration adviser in economics and the creation of a Peer Concentration Counseling (PCC) program in government. These changes will impact roughly one in four Harvard students.
The advising reforms reflect divergent mentalities about restructuring the advising systems within the two concentrations, both of which have been plagued by a reputation for poor advising in the past.
While the Economics department continues to centralize its advising resources within the Littauer building, the Government department has chosen to divide advising responsibilities both to House tutors and to upperclassmen Government concentrators.
Yet advisers within both departments say that their goals are the same—to make a large department and a large pool of concentrators feel like a more tight-knit community.
“I know there is a perception that government students can get lost in the shuffle,” said Greg A. DiBella ’12, one of the 15 PCCs hired by the Government department for this semester.
DiBella said he has spoken to roughly eight students in person and e-mailed with another five about questions regarding course selection and choosing a concentration.
“I think the PCCs are probably a good thing because if students stumble across the [PCC website], they might be more likely to email the students than teachers or official advisers,” DiBella said.
He also stressed that the PCCs serve in a more informal capacity, as they are not assigned official advisees and are meant more “to be a source of additional information for the kids.”
According to Kiran Gajwani, the new staff Economics department concentration adviser, changes in economics advising similarly serve to dispel the sense that the department is “too impersonal.”
But administrators within the Economics Department said they also plan to expand the staff concentration advising program—rather than foster a greater number of  informal advising relationships—in order to help the department seem more navigable.
Department Chair of Economics John Y. Campbell said that he hopes to expand the staff concentration adviser program to include two more advisers like Gajwani—perhaps to be supported by a group of graduate students—in the coming years.
Gajwani, who will personally advise students in Kirkland, Lowell, Winthrop, and the Quad Houses, said that the program has already garnered positive responses among economics concentrators.
“Things are in the early stages, but our hope is to build a feeling of community within the Economics department,” Gajwani said.
“Already students have told us that they notice the increased communication with their advisers—whereas before they mainly interacted with their advisers when they needed their study cards signed,” she added.

Gordon Brown will be coming to the Institute of Politics as a Visiting Fellow next week, the IOP announced yesterday. Brown served as the Prime Minister of Britain and Leader of the Labour Party from 2007 to 2010.
Although Brown’s exact schedule for his time on campus has not been finalized, he will have small, off-the-record discussions with students and various student groups, according to IOP Fellows and Study Groups Coordinator Eric R. Andersen.
The focus of Brown’s visit to Harvard’s campus will be on undergraduates, although he is also scheduled to work with graduate students and faculty members. Brown’s visit, which is scheduled for Sept. 21-23, will culminate in a lecture on the international economy at the Forum on Sept. 23.
The IOP had sent a letter to Brown in June inviting him to be a visiting fellow sometime this fall semester.
“He was interested from the get-go,” IOP President P. Kenzie Bok ’11 said. “For us, he is just a dream international fellow.”
Bok also said that because many students are interested in international affairs and the governments of other countries, and in particular Britain, Brown was an ideal visiting fellow. Brown was the center of media attention following the British elections last May that resulted in the Labour Party losing majority in the British Parliament. Consequently, he resigned as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labour Party.
According to Andersen, Brown is similar to many other IOP visiting fellows in that he wants to give back to students and hopes that more students will be inspired to become public servants.
As a visiting fellow, Brown will lead discussions aimed primarily at undergraduates and speak at events open to the public.
According to IOP Interim Director John C. Culver ’54, the IOP typically hosts six resident fellows who remain on campus for the entire semester, and visiting fellows who come for much shorter periods of time, ranging from two days to a week.
Besides interacting directly with students in intimate discussion settings, Brown will also have three undergraduate student liaisons—selected through an application process—according to Bok.
A lottery to attend Brown’s lecture at the IOP Forum on September 23 is ongoing and closes on September 20.

The number of robbery and aggravated assault reports on and around campus increased last year, while most other indicators of crime remained unchanged or dropped, according to statistics released by the Harvard University Police Department.
And yesterday in a press release, Insite Security, a private security company, reported the results of a study that found that Harvard’s rate of “forcible sex offenses” was more than four times the national average and that the burglary rate was the highest among MIT, Stanford, Duke, the University of Chicago, and the Ivy League.
The “Insite Ivy League Crime Report,” which analyzed crimes occuring on college campuses and their vicinity in 2008, found Harvard’s burglary rate to be 11.06 offenses per 1,000 people and its rate of forcible sex offenses—which includes any sex-related offense involving force—to be 1.32 offenses per 1,000 people.
The national average rate for burglary was 7.31, and the average rate for the category of sexual crimes—defined, in this case, as forcible rape offenses—was 0.29, according to the report, which cited data from the United States Department of Education and the FBI, as well as university sources.
“Colleges have historically underreported crimes that happen on campus,” Christopher E. Falkenberg, Insite president, wrote in a press release. “Parents are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars sending their children to institutes of higher learning and in return should expect a safe environment both on campus and off.”
But HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano characterized the reported burglary rate as misleading, writing in an e-mail that HUPD classifies the majority of its property crimes as burglaries, which he called “a very conservative approach.” Larcenies, another property crime, are similar to burglaries but do not involve trespassing.
“We feel when you look at property crime as a whole, our rates are not much different than any other Ivy or local school,” he said.
And he attributed the heightened rate of forcible sex offenses—which, in three-quarters of the schools Insite analyzed, were higher than the national average—to a high rate of reporting at Harvard due to a “a solid support network for victims of sexual assault.”
Reported rates of rape and fondling in 2009 have been in line with past years, according to the statistics released by HUPD, but, from 2008 to 2009, the number of aggravated assaults doubled from 14 to 28 and the number of robberies increased from 16 to 29.
Catalano wrote that the increases “occurred on the city streets immediately surrounding our campus” and that HUPD “is concerned about any increase in criminal activity.”
Meanwhile, the number of simple assaults—which the FBI defines as assaults that do not involve dangerous weapons or result in serious injuries—on and around campus decreased from 27 to 19, and the number of drug-related arrests fell from 23 to 6, which can be attributed to a change in Mass. law that decriminalized the posession of small amounts of marijuana, according to Catalano.
The release of the statistics is mandated by the Clery Act, a federal law that requires a yearly disclosure of campus crime.

Sal N. DiDomenico won the Democratic primary for a State Senate seat last night, earning the chance to run in the November general election and likely retain the seat he has held since May.
DiDomenico defeated Timothy R. Flaherty for the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex seat by a margin of approximately 178 votes out of over 10,000 cast, according to Flaherty spokeswoman Dorie R. Clark.
In his hometown of Cambridge, Flaherty took far more votes—2,592 to DiDomenico’s 993.
In the 13 Boston precincts—including parts of Allston, Brighton, and Charlestown—which are included in the district, Flaherty topped DiDomenico with 1,490 votes to the incumbent’s 956. However, DiDomenico had strong results in Everett, where he is a former City Councillor; he picked up over 2,000 votes more than Flaherty there.
DiDomenico defeated Flaherty and four other Democratic candidates for the seat in a special primary held last April, after former State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio resigned the seat upon being sentenced to a year in jail for an alcohol-related probation violation.
Flaherty was the closest of the five runners-up in the April race, losing to DiDomenico—who previously served as Galluccio’s chief of staff—by about 135 votes.
He declared on the day after his loss that he would run again in the fall, when the normal election schedule dictates that the seat is up for grabs again.
“It was an emotional evening,” Clark said tonight after Flaherty conceded at 9:15 p.m. “This was the second time we had such a close race.”
DiDomenico will now face the sole Republican candidate, Barbara T. Bush of Charlestown, in the general election. The winner will serve a two-year term on Beacon Hill.
Other contested races on Cambridge residents’ ballots in yesterday’s primary included State Auditor, which Democrat Suzanne M. Bump and Republican Mary Z. Connaughton won in their respective races, and the Democratic race for treasurer, won by Steve Grossman.

CORRECTION: September 15, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 15 news article "DiDomenico Wins Democratic Primary" stated that only 3,585 of Cambridge's registered voters cast votes in the in the DiDomenico-Flaherty race, creating a turnout of 5.87 percent. In fact, there were a total of 9,073 ballots cast in the city for a voter turnout of about 15 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was in his fourth grade history class that Peter Der Manuelian ’81—Harvard’s first Egyptology professor in over 60 years—first became enamored with the splendor of ancient Egypt.
“You know how you battle against school all your youth?” he asked, sitting in his office in the Semitic Museum.“I remember that being the first time I was actively interested in something—the scale of Egypt, the monuments, the beauty of the language, the art styles.”
Raised in the Boston area, Der Manuelian says he feels lucky to have grown up in a city with a museum whose ancient Egyptian collection is as extensive as the Museum of Fine Arts’s. When he matriculated at Harvard, he ended up concentrating in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, the same department in which he currently teaches. His thesis was on Amenhotep II, an athletic New Kingdom pharaoh he describes as “the world’s first super jock.”
This fall, Der Manuelian, who had been teaching at Tufts University, is offering a new General Education course, Societies of the World 38, “Pyramid Schemes: The Archaeological History of Egypt.” So far, 165 students have enrolled in the course. Der Manuelian said he expects to teach the course, along with several other more specialized classes, for the next few years.
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
Der Manuelian says that what makes Egyptology most exciting today is the technological innovation that now drives its progress.
“If anything, in the last several decades, Egyptology has grown with the vast interest in technology and the internet,” he said. “There are elaborate coffee table books, spectacular color photographs—and all of this has really brought ancient Egypt alive in the ways that it wasn’t 40, 50, or 60 years ago.”
Der Manuelian said that the General Education course will show off the Giza Archives Project, an international initiative assembling all archaeological activities at the famous Giza pyramids past, present, and future. The Project, a collaboration that incorporates the Harvard-MFA Expedition, includes a 3D reconstruction of the tombs, pyramids, and temples on the Giza plateau.
“You can get the tomb’s-eye view, which is something I couldn’t do in 1977,” Der Manuelian said.
When they are not exploring virtual Giza, students in the General Education course will make two iMovies. Der Manuelian says the assignments will help students to think visually about a visual civilization.
For Amy Y. Tai ’13, the iMovie projects were initially a cause for concern.
“That was actually one of the questions I had about taking the course,” she said. “But...he made it seem really cool. After that, I felt really comfortable.”
Der Manuelian, Harvard’s first Egyptologist in 68 years, is following in the footsteps of Harvard’s last Egyptologist, the late George A. Reisner, a titan in the field who died mid-excavation in Giza in 1942.
REISNER’S LEGACY
According to Der Manuelian, Reisner, technically a Harvard professor, never owned any property in Cambridge and only returned to teach four or five semesters over the course of his career. Throughout this period, Reisner also maintained his position as a curator in absentia at the Museum of Fine Arts.
Like Reisner, Der Manuelian has spent much of his professional life in Giza, in his own version of “Harvard Camp.” The first time he went to Egypt was in 1977, the summer after high school, but he has returned numerous times since and spent 1984-7 in Luxor as an epigrapher on a University of Chicago project.
Egypt has changed between Reisner’s time there and his own. But, Der Manuelian says, “fortunately, the pyramids are still there.”
NEW BEGINNINGS
Despite the 68-year gap between Harvard Egyptologists—and also the long gaps between the College’s sporadic offerings in the field of ancient Egypt—Der Manuelian says that there was not a “dark time” when his field failed to generate interest in the postwar American academy.
“Maybe Harvard looked around and said, ‘Well, [Egyptology] is taught really well at some other places,’” he said. “But I’m delighted and grateful that [this department] was able to come through.”
Even though Egyptologists study the distant past, Der Manuelian says that his field can nevertheless provide important insights into the world of today.
“I think that any time you have a civilization that’s lasted three or four millennia, there’s something worth studying there,” he said. “A belief system, an  ideology that exists for that long—there’s definitely something there to study and to learn. These are all ways of making sense of the world around you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a brief meeting in Washington D.C. this afternoon, University President Drew G. Faust and Eric Balderas '13—the undocumented student who faced possible deportation this summer—thanked a U.S. senator who helped Balderas attain his deferred action status.
Following the meeting, which took place in the office of Illinois Senator Richard J. Durbin, Faust released a statement reinforcing the University's stance on proposed legislation that would help undocumented students like Balderas.
“Eric and I want to thank Senator Durbin for his sponsorship of the DREAM Act, which would throw a lifeline to thousands of students across the country like Eric who, through no fault of their own, face uncertain futures due to their immigration status," Faust said in the statement.
If passed, the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
"These young men and women are working hard in school and are dedicated to a future living in and contributing to our communities or serving in the military," Faust said. "I believe it is in our best interest to educate all students to their full potential."
On June 7, Balderas, who illegally immigrated to the United States from Mexico with his family at the age of 4, was detained by immigration authorities when he tried to use his Harvard identification to board a plane from his hometown of San Antonio, Texas to Boston.
Balderas' incident led to an outpouring of support for the aspiring molecular and cellular biology concentrator. With Durbin's help, Balderas was granted permission to stay in the United States indefinitely. While U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement can still revoke the deferral, as of now, Balderas may continue studying at Harvard without facing the threat of deportation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here in the Northeast, where people are obsessed with hockey and other frozen sports, water polo doesn’t quite get the attention it deserves. But as sophomore Max Eliot proves in this interview, Harvard’s water polo team has got just as much going on (and wants to beat Brown just as badly) as any other Crimson squad. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Max Eliot
Year: 2013
Stats: Eliot made his mark during his freshman season as Harvard’s fourth-highest scorer with 25 goals and was named the CWPA Rookie of the week three times. He has also scored a goal in each of his three collegiate matchups against George Washington, including the game-winner in the last minute of play in Sunday’s 9-8 win over the Colonials at the Princeton Invitational.
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Whatever looks good in the dining hall that isn’t really fatty or loaded in grease.  I always try to have some rice or pasta for carbs too.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Whatever is in my recently played list on my iPod which is generally a lot of electronic music.  One song I always listen to right before I get in the water is “Put On” by Young Jeezy.
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
Definitely Brown.  They are our biggest rival, so it’s always a good game when we play them.  Plus there are four guys on their team from my high school so I always really want to beat them.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
No Comment.*
*Editor’s Note:  We’re pretty sure we’re never going to get a straight answer for this one.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had in the pool.
When I was 12, I was swimming down the pool in a game, and a player from the other team grabbed my suit to pull me back.  Unfortunately for me, instead of pulling me back the other player managed to pull my suit down to my knees.  I guess you could say that I learned to tie my suits tightly the hard way.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
Great White Shark.  I’m fast, I’m strong and I’m big in the water.  Plus I’d like to think that the other team is afraid of me.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Meatloaf.  Enough said.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Lacrosse because I need an excuse to wear pinnies and grow sick flow.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
Chaser because I score goals.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
I would take Amanda Beard to In-N-Out.  It’s all about the Double Double plain with animal style fries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No matter one’s opinion of Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker and his recruiting tactics, there is no disputing that the former Michigan and Seton Hall coach is committed to establishing a fresh legacy for a historically-middling Crimson program.
Just one year ago, Amaker and his staff welcomed to campus five prospects the likes of which are rarely seen in the Ivy League. Dwight Powell and Rod Odom, both among the top 100 players in the nation, were joined on official visits by marksman Austin Carroll, big man Majok Majok, and seven-footer Ugo Okam.
Only Okam eventually became a member of the Harvard class of 2014. Though the Crimson was one of Powell’s final three schools, and Odom maintained strong interest, in the end Amaker proved unable to win multiple recruiting battles with high-major BCS schools.
Harvard still managed to do quite all right: Okam is joined on the roster by highly-rated rookie Laurent Rivard, and the Crimson’s five-player haul is arguably once again the best in the league. But Amaker has made his ambitions clear: he aims to capitalize on the university’s name and generous financial aid in order to steal prospects from conferences far more prestigious (athletically) than the Ancient Eight.
While he may have failed to hit a home run last year—and in July even elected to acknowledge a secondary recruiting violation that occurred in the summer of 2007—it appears that the former Duke star is ready for another try at making a national splash, just a few months before the beginning of his fourth season at the helm of Harvard.
This upcoming weekend—which will, like last year, feature the home opener for the Crimson football team—a strong crop of prospects will be once again visiting Cambridge and exploring all that Harvard has to offer.
The group is headlined by Kenyatta Smith, a 6’8, 275-lb big man at Flintridge Prep School (La Canada Flintridge, Calif.). Harboring ambitions of attending medical school, the post prospect has a final three of Vanderbilt, Penn, and the Crimson. He will visit Vanderbilt next weekend.
Rated a 90 by ESPN, which has him ranked as the No. 29 center in the nation, Smith attended the NBA Top 100 Camp in June and has the potential to make big waves in the Ivies—especially critical for Harvard, severely lacking in front-court depth.
“The size and tools are there,” Scout’s Dave Telep wrote of Smith. “Once he turns up the intensity and becomes comfortable as a force in the paint, he’s got a chance to have a strong college career.”
“They’ve been after Kenyatta for quite some time now, so I think he’s got a good relationship with the coaches, from Amaker down to coach [Brian] DeStefano, [Yanni] Hufnagel, and [Kenny] Blakeney,” said Garrett Ohara, Smith’s high school coach. “He’s really comfortable with them, and obviously the school is a great place. He’ll enjoy his visit out there, and he told me he enjoyed meeting some of the players on an unofficial visit last year.”
“He’s gotten close with the Penn staff as well,” Ohara added. “Vanderbilt came in a little bit later...the relationships with the coaches will be very important to him.”
Smith, who was unable to be reached for comment, will be joined this weekend by a pair of promising back-court prospects.
A senior at White Station High School (Memphis, Tenn.), Andre Hollins has the Crimson among his final five. Hollins, who is rated as a three-star prospect and No. 30 at his position by Scout and No. 126 in the nation by Rivals, sounded excited to talk about Harvard in an interview last week.
“[Their] academics [are among] the best in the world—I know I can’t go wrong there,” Hollins said. “Athletically, they’re doing some good things.”
Hollins made a visit to Auburn two weeks ago—which he reportedly described as “perfect”—and next month the 6’2.5”, 195-pound guard will be visiting the campuses of his other three choices: Ole Miss, Minnesota, and Stanford. On Monday, his Facebook page said, “Enjoying my home visit with Stanford coaches.”
Hollins has said he plans on making a decision in early November, after his visits and before his high school season begins.
Spencer Dinwiddie, a senior at Taft High School (Woodland Hills, Calif.) also has the Crimson as one of his leaders.
The 6’4.5”, 175-lb. point guard said early last week his final schools are Santa Clara, Harvard, Oregon, Colorado, Georgetown, UNLV, and Stanford. He currently holds offers from all of them except for Georgetown.
On his Facebook page last Friday, Dinwiddie said, “Colorado visit waz real kool..they def deserve to be in the list with Harvard and Oregon.”
“I got 6 but those 3 kinda separated themselves,” Dinwiddie also commented. He said yesterday that UCLA may be trying to re-recruit him.
Dinwiddie is rated a four-star recruit by ESPN and No. 29 at his position in the nation by Scout. Named the MVP of the Adidas Super 64 tournament in late July, Dinwiddie is ranked as the No. 8 player in the state of California by Cali High Sports, which called him “the best passer on the West Coast.”
“I definitely have the best relationship with the Harvard coaches out of all of them,” Dinwiddie said. “[Assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel] and coach [Tommy] Amaker have been very diligent in my recruitment. I’ve kind of grown attached to them, so it’ll be hard not to choose them. I also think the way they try to get up and down fits my style. And they say if I work hard, playing time will be there, and I’ll have the opportunity to start by the end of freshman year.”
Dinwiddie said he plans to sign during the early signing period in November.
The other confirmed weekend visitor to Cambridge is Steve Moundou-Missi, a 6’6, 225-lb combination forward from Montverde Academy (Montverde, Fl.) The Cameroon native, who came to the United States two years ago, said last week that he is interested in the Crimson, Brown, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, and Vanderbilt. He currently has offers from Brown, Morehead State, and Harvard, but has no favorite and no other visits planned.
Amaker is looking to add to an existing recruiting class of one: Jonah Travis (Minneapolis, Minn.), who committed to the Crimson last month. Travis will be coming to campus this weekend as well, with the explicit goal of convincing his fellow high school seniors to join him next year.
The only way Amaker and his staff will be able to achieve their dream of gaining Harvard men’s basketball a place on the national stage—not to mention its first Ivy title—is by drawing in higher level talent. The road to building “something special,” as Amaker is so fond of saying, could potentially have its foundation laid this weekend.

If you’ve stepped into the Admissions Visitor Center at the Agassiz House lately, maybe you’ve heard an admissions officers explain that to get into Harvard, you don’t have to win a Nobel Prize in the fourth grade.
That accomplishment, they quip, comes in the fifth grade.
Jokes aside, however, few would contest that Crimson applicants do put together very impressive resumes. In fact, to understand this, we need to look no further than the brand new class of 2014.
Enter Bonnie Hu and Seiji Liu. In addition to graduating at the top of their respective classes, both students are listed in Golfweek magazine as a “Freshman to Watch.” With only 20 male and 20 female athletes named in the article, Hu and Liu’s titles are undoubtedly a sign of good things to come for the Harvard men’s and women’s golf teams.
Strangely enough, tennis served as a springboard for both Hu and Liu in beginning their golf careers.
“I had burned out from tennis,” Liu explains. “I played too much when I was growing up, and I got too into it, so my dad switched me over to golf. It was a way for me to spend more time with him and my siblings, and it was a fun game to play.”
Hu’s father, like Liu’s, seemed to have the same idea.
“I had to stop playing tennis, and my dad thought I should get into golf,” Hu says. “One of my best friends at the time was also playing golf, so I thought it would be fun.”
The “fun” sport hooked both Hu and Liu, and by the time high school arrived, both were deeply invested in the game.
Liu, for his part, transferred at the start of 10th grade to The Pendleton School of the IMG Academies in Bradenton, Fla., to focus more closely on honing his skills.
“It was kind of half school, half intensive golf training,” he says. “That escalated my game.”
And escalate, his game certainly did.
Over the next three years, Liu picked up seven AJGA top-10 finishes as well as 12 top-15 finishes. In perhaps his finest golf moment, Liu nabbed second place at the 2008 AJGA Mayakoba Classic.
When Liu graduated from The Pendleton School, he was ranked 38th overall in the Golfweek/Titlest National Rankings, and within his high school class, he was ranked 12th. Academically, the Crimson golfer was just as strong. A two-time HP Junior Academic All-American, Liu was valedictorian and an AP Scholar with Honors.
Harvard, then, was a simpler transition than one would expect for the typical incoming freshman.
“[Balancing golf] taught me time management and how to be more independent,” Liu explains. “So, the transition here is not as difficult as it would be had I not been at IMG.”
Hopefully, Hu will likewise find that her high school experiences have prepared her well for the rigors of college life.
From her freshman year onward, Hu dedicated much of her free time to the sport.
“It took up a lot of time because I practiced every day after school and played on weekends,” she says. “There wasn’t much time for extracurriculars.”
But clearly, this busy schedule did little to deter Hu. In 2008, Hu was part of an eight-person team representing the US in the US-China Junior Championship in Beijing. The following year, the Crimson athlete collected two AJGA victories as well as the women’s championship trophy at the San Francisco City Championship.
To wrap up her high school career, Hu, like Liu, twice nabbed HP Junior Academic All-American honors, and she graduated valedictorian from Mission San Jose High School. Her ranking within the class of 2010 on the National Junior Golf Scoreboard? Ninth in the country.
Clearly, then, Hu and Liu’s arrival marks no small addition to the men’s and women’s golf teams. Both teams and their coaching staff have, consequently, been “phenomenal” in welcoming the new freshmen to the squads and showing them the ropes.
Already, in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Tri-Meet this past weekend, Liu proved that he’s ready for some collegiate competition. He captured a team-best two victories in the Crimson’s second-place finish.
“Because I’ve played so many events over my high school career, I treated it like any other event,” Liu says. “I don’t worry about my opponents.”
Hu, likewise, seems unaffected by the idea of new competition. With her first taste of college-level competition arriving this Saturday at the Princeton Invitational, she seems calm and ready.
“I came here,” she says, “to play on a team.”
With this team emphasis in mind, hopefully, these budding stars will help their squads claim the Ancient Eight crown for Harvard golf.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (2-6) travelled to Worcester, Mass., to face Holy Cross (5-8) at the Holy Cross Field House. The Crimson lost in three closely contested sets, 25-23, 25-20, 28-26.
In a match that was most notable for its frequent score changes, 11 in total in the first set of the match alone, Harvard proved unable to protect its leads or force errors at crucial points in the game. Tied in the opening frame at 23, the Crimson seemed poised to record its first winning set in nearly three matches, but Holy Cross charged back with two timely kills to snatch the set from Harvard.
In the second set, the Crimson again charged ahead with an early 10-2 lead, but ultimately dropped the set to the Crusaders after Holy Cross strung together a 10-2 run late in the frame.
In the third and final set, the Crusaders once again came back after trailing early to win by their largest margin of 28-26.
Harvard was led by sophomore Taylor Docter, who recorded a double-double with 10 kills and 12 digs. Freshman Natalie Doyle tallied 36 assists, while junior defensive specialist Christine Wu led the Crimson defense with 16 digs.
Holy Cross similarly was led by great performances from three of their key players. Sophomore Megan Lynch recorded 15 kills and 9 digs in the course of her match, while senior Chelsey O’Donnell tailed 35 assists. Most notably on the Crusader side, sophomore Elizabeth Watters recorded 11 digs to cap off her seventh double-digit performance in the season thus far.
Despite the Crimson’s hard fought loss, the match against Holy Cross showcased the remarkable potential that the Harvard women’s volleyball team currently holds.
“We pushed really hard throughout the game, and we had glimpses of what our team could be,” captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “But we weren’t consistent in the way we played.”
The Harvard captain later added, “We have a very young team, so it’s hard for some of the younger girls who haven’t had the experiences that some of the upperclassmen have had.”
Despite the relative youth of this season’s women’s volleyball team, Ingersoll has been impressed with the performance of several freshmen.
“Teresa Skelly has been a really solid force on the team,” Ingersoll said. “You see her in practice working hard and the whole team definitely sees her effort...Natalie Doyle has great energy on the court that others can look towards, and Erin Cooney always seems to come in at clutch moments.”
The Crimson returns to action during the Northwestern Invitational Sept. 17-18, where Harvard will face off against Marquette, Charlotte and host Northwestern. The Crimson will start Ivy League play at Dartmouth on Sept. 24.

Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced on Monday that Harvard will have “Optional Winter Activities Week,” which will run from Jan. 16 to the 23.
During this week, students can opt to return to campus and participate in student-initiated activities.
While we love the fact that we have the option to return a week earlier this year, we’re not so sure how we feel about the program’s less than creative name.
Perhaps “Optional Winter Activities Week” should be renamed “Week for Kids Who Don't Like Vacation” or “Week When All Your Friends Have Gone Back to School and You Have Nothing to Do.” Perhaps this is the week for Math 55 students to finally emerge from Lamont Library and have some fun around campus. Or maybe it it’s a chance for undergraduates to flee their sunny Florida homes and return to their frigid dorm rooms.
In all seriousness, if you’re interested in participating in or organizing activities during this week without classes, you can go to Harvard’s new winter break website.
The site provides information about the entire January Term and the shorter Optional Winter Activities Week. At the moment though, some information is lacking. There isn't anything about the dining hours or the gym hours during the break.

Hollywood makes its latest attempt to depict life at Harvard in the upcoming movie “The Social Network.”
The movie has gotten a chilly reception from one Harvard graduate and former Crimson Associate Managing Editor Rebecca D. O’Brien ’06. In an article on The Daily Beast, O’Brien recalls her time with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, while they were both undergraduates in Kirkland House.
O’Brien disputes the movie’s characterization of Harvard at the time and of Zuckerberg, who she wrote was called “Slayer” by his fraternity brothers in AEPi.
She describes the movie as a sensationalized version of the truth. In her view it unfairly characterizes Zuckerberg as a “mad scientist” seeking “popularity, profit, and revenge.” She quotes a former classmate who said, “The whole notion of Mark as either an evil genius or as a deeply status-obsessed person doesn’t ring true to me at all.” Rather, O’Brien remembers him as a computer whiz with an anti-authoritarian streak.
The movie also characterizes Harvard as a place of sex, drugs, and scandal, according to O'Brien. But from her experience this wasn’t true, she wrote. She notes that the final club parties were never as much fun as they are made out to be in the film’s script and trailers. O’Brien admits she hasn’t actually been able to see the film herself, basing her piece on the script and trailers.
She’ll have to wait until Oct. 1 like the rest of us, when “The Social Network” comes out in theaters. Will you go see it?
